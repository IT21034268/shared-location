1,The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,"I am totally disgusted that anyone would recommend this book.My 12 year old daughter started reading it and said mom, this book is bad. I started skimming through it, which I should of done before I bought it, and I would compare it to an adult Harlequin Romance book. We wonder why our children are growing up so fast and doing things that they shouldn't be doing.Let's keep them pure in mind and body (...)"
5,Tip Top of the Line,"Wow. This book captures the true essence of life long friendship. It made me feel good about myself and my friends. It tells the story of these girls, Carmen, Bridgette, Lena, and Tibby, and how they all go different places in the summer while being connected by this pair of pants. At first this idea seemed incredibly corny, stupid, niave, etc., but it was nothing but excellent. I recommended it to all my friends and family. The thing is, all these girls go through so many of the things most teenagers go through and it made it so true to life. It is definetly an exquisite read."
5,The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,"I read 'The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants' a week or so ago, unsure of whether or not I would like it. I loved reading about Bridget, Carmen, Tibby, and Lena, and their summers apart. They really reminded me of me and my best friend! This book made me laugh, it made me gasp, it made me cry, and it kept me reading it for hours on end! This is the best book I have ever read, and I definetly think that others should read it too! I hope that Anne Brashers writes a sequel soon!"
4,Not really bad...,it was really great. But i dont think that the dog eating part was really nessesary... not all koreans eat dogs. and most ppl dont... but other than that i thought it was a really entertainging and fun book to read...
5,very good book,this is a great book for young teens. this book had me at the edge of my seat. Bridget goes to soccer camp and meets eric their relationship is steaming hot. Lena goes to greece to see her family with her sister effie. while in greece lena meets kostos and falls in love. Tibby meets a girl named Bailey and later finds out Bailey has leukemia. Finally Carmen goes to south carolina to be with her dad and soon finds out he is gettting into a marriage unwanted by carmen. this book takes you through the crazy and exciting lives of 4 girls. I love this book!!!
3,Boxed Set of The Traveling Pants: The complete Collection,"Wow! I was really disappointed in the condition of the box,all the cornerswere torn or ripped and getting the books back in took quite awhile. Not What I expected. The case in displaying a set of books in very important on a shelf. This one will have to be put in the back. I love these books and have waited a long time to fine the collection.I called the company that sent them out and their response was, oh sorryabout that, and then they sent me $8.00. Not impressesd with them."
5,One of the best books I have ever read and I'm a guy!,If you haven't read this yet go buy one copy of it. Or you can get it at your local libarary. It is sad but has many funny parts and is told interestingly.
4,Can't put it down!,"I remeber seeing the previews for the movies with a bunch of friends and we all talked about how when the movie comes out, we were going to come see it. Well i thought the movies was great. A couple of weeks ago i was given the oppportunity to read the book. It is a little different from the movie but those of you who like to read would probably enjoy the book more. Overall it was great and i couldn't put it down. Instead of doin the reading (Les Miserables by Victor Hugo)for my English class I would read the Sisterhood. It got me a little behind on my other readding but i think it was worth it!"
4,"a good chick book Wisconsin,U.S.A.",This is a book that I would recommend as a spirit builder. It's a story about 4 girls that find these pair of pants and they all need the pants to help them with their problems. They take them all over the U.S. even to Greece and the pants connect them. I really recommend this book as a good chick book.
5,Great teenage girl book,"This was a great book for a teenage girl. It is about four girls: Carmen, Lena, Bridget, and Tibby. They all have to split up for the summer: Lena going to visit her grandparents in Greece, Carmen going to visit her father and his family, Bridget going to soccer camp, and Tibby staying home. They all face their own problems over the summer. What holds them together is a pair of jeans. A pair of jeans, that Carmen bought at a thrift store. The jeans were an average size, but they fit all the girls wonderfully, even though they were all different shapes and sizes. They send the jeans to one another along with a note each week. This book is very emotional and sad and a very good book for teenage girls to read."
5,A Fun to Read Book!,This is one of the best books I've ever read! It's very funny and fun to read. It's about 4 girls who are really good friends. One of them finds a pair of jeans in a thrift shop. They all try them on and it fits each of them perfectly. They decide to create the Sisterhood of the traveling pants and send them to each other over the summer. Each girls story is very different and very realistic. It took great force for me to put it down and I can't wait to read the next book in the series!
5,you have to read this,"Theres really not a lot I can say besides it would a good idea if you read this book. I dont want to give any of it away. It didnt take me long to read because Im 15 and a fast reader but I thouroughly enjoyed it. I thought it was just going to be another cheesey teen valley twins-like book but this adventure between 4 very realistic girls was heartfelt and impossible to put down. I identified with Tibby the most but I wish I could be like Bridget. I laughed, I cried, and when it was over I wanted it to go on forever. I hope this author writes another novel. Read the book. Every girl no matter what age should read this book."
2,Shallow and Stupid,"I was shocked to see that this book garnered so many positive reviews! Being a persistent person, I hate to start a book and not finish it, but let me tell you, I really considered giving up on this book. I tried to get into it, I really did, but it's hard to like a book in which the characters are so...annoying! I loathed Bridget and Tibby, but I found Carmen, at times, refreshing (although somewhat stereotypical). The story was trite and predictible, a tale of adolescent discovery and growth that has been told many times and in much better ways. In conclusion, I do NOT recommend this book to anyone that wants complex, original, likable characters and a refreshing story."
2,If you like Meg Cabot ...,"This book is not a difficult read; in fact, I finished it from cover to cover in under four hours. I don't think I had terribly high expectations, but this book most certainly did not live up to those that I had. The characters, although not ""Mary Sue"" perfect girls, fit into the young adult book stereotype: the cynical one, the introverted one, the pretty one, the nice one, etc. Perhaps the author was trying to create characters one could relate to and feel like one knows, but to me they seemed no different then those created by any other author.If you like the ""Princess"" series by Meg Cabot, you'll love ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants."" Or, if you're like me and you thought Meg Cabot's books were mediocre at best, then I advise you to read something more worthy of your time."
5,The Best Teenage Book Out There,"I got this book for my birthday from my parents. i thought it was going to be just another boring, have to read school book, but it was nothing like that. I was amazed with all the detail. It was the best book I have ever read. I am doing a report for school on this book and can't figure out what part to read out of the book, because it was so good. It is great for any age. After I finished it my mom read it and loved it. It is a must read."
4,Funny and Endearing,"Four friends are about to leave each other all summer. But, before they do, one of them finds a pair of magical jeans that fit each of them perfectly. They decide to send each other the jeans and share them. Once the girls split up, you travel with the pants from girl to girl finding out what happens to each of them over the course of the summer. Worth reading. I know a few of my students (6th graders) loved this book."
4,The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants by Ann Brashares is a delightfull, coming of age story that teenage girls will enjoy from beginning to end. Follow the jouney of thepants as it becomes a magical element of four girls summer experiences. The girls learn about themselves, about each other and about growing up all with the help and comfort of th traveling pants."
2,written by a teacher,"This is an okay book, but read it first before passing to you elementary age children. The writing is easy enough that a 4th or 5th grader could read it, but the themes are too mature for that age range."
3,Meh...,"I'm sorry, I tried to like it, but I'm gonna have to be indifferent towards it. The only girl whose story I liked was Lena's. I could relate to Lena. Tibby was kinda boring, Carmen, well she was interesting, and Bridget...well she seemed...I can't think of anything nice. Who knows? Maybe if I give it a second read, then I might like it better. Who knows? Sisterhood of the travelling pants 2 that's coming out next april might be better, but as a seventeen year old girl...I'm gonna have to say, this didn't appeal to me like I thought it would. But don't let it stop you from reading and forming your own opinion."
5,Great Read,This was a great series of books. She really keeps you interested and wanting to read the next chapter because each character gets a small piece in each chapter so you really stay engaged. It took me a week to read all four!!
4,Not just for young readers,I'm in my 40's and I really enjoyed this audiobook. It took me back to that same period in my life. The narrator was great and it's a fun and creative piece of writing. I think that having it under the young adult section may cause many women to miss out. Give it a try...you'll enjoy it!
5,Gripping,"I read this book in one sitting. And stayed up far beyond my bedtime. But it was worth it. I don't think there is anything that could improve this book. The four intertwining stories about the girls fit together perfectly and their ups and downs and emotions are flowing and articulate. They can be thick at times, but you want the best for the characters and won't sit still until you know what's happened.This is a ""girl"" book (as the marketing campaign for the sequel attests), but this guy loved it."
3,Good enough,I am using this product to store CD's that I don't use very often because they are loaded onto my server. It is sturdy enough and does what it is supposed to do. If I were getting into the binder regularly - it wouldn't do though because it doesn't open enough. The price was right for my purpose.
5,Restaurant Favorites at Home,"This cookbook was in excellent condition. The book had many good recipes that many in my family would eat, but not one's that I am particularly fond of and which suit my taste. I am just a picky eater."
2,A book only for those who must have every C I book,"Since I have quite a few Cooks Illustrated books and find them invaluable, I was surprised that I did not find this volume very appealing. While every recipe is discussed and presented in the typical C I thorough detail, I simply could not find that many items I wanted to create. And some recipes, like filet mignon with roquefort cheese, are so common they scarcely seem to merit inclusion. This is one book I will be passing on rather than keeping."
4,"Uncommon recipes, not what I expected.","I assumed this book would contain recipes for classic dishes commonly found at restaurants. That is not the case. This book contains adaptations of unusual and imaginative dishes by world-class chefs. I was hoping for something simpler, closer to my level. More advanced gourmet cooks will appreciate this book more."
3,All Karoake Ain't Equal,"The tracks for this are very good, but the singers for the demos are sometimes painful."
5,rockabilly masterpiece,A modern rockabilly masterpiece by an originator of the genre. Burlison's songs and fuzzed guitar playing make you want to boogie across your living room. This is American roots music at its best.
1,Kings of the Road,"This film is a cheap rip-off of the original film ""Ice Hockey in the Rose City"" made in 1996 by Findlay Films. The orginal film included a complete history of hockey in Portland, including countless interviews with players and historical film that will never be matched. This film has violated copyright and will soon be removed for sale on various sites, including this one. Save your money, and time by passing on this artistic disaster and attemped re-make of the original. Anyone purchasing this so called film is wasting their time. If there was a way to rate this a zero (0) that would be accurate."
2,did not meet my expectations,"after watching some pathfinder videos on you tube , i decided to get this sheath for my ontario 18 inch machete. this thing feels like it was made out of old milk cartons , flimsy , noisy and in no way will i use this for my machete. i will opt to make my own out of kydex, wich is readily available on amazon."
4,"I like it, little flaws.","Besides getting sent the wrong damn color ( which is not why i gave it 4) their are only two flaws i see with this sheath. The metal stud that holds the belt clip will really scrape up your blade as you push it in and pull it out. Scraped up my Ontario 18 inch. machete. I don't have all these fancy power tools so i fixed this the ghetto way. Stuck two Huge screwdrivers in it and blow-dried each side till the plastic turned soft then i left the Screwdrivers in for a few hours and it seemed to mold like that. No scrape now. The last problem is the belt clip itself. Useless in my book, really wish they updated it to work with current day military belts. I'm sure somebody can rig it some way to work. Besides those flaws i love the way it looks as a sheath. For the price i recommend it. I slip it in the side pack on the Kelty Redwing44. Fits perfect."
3,Adequate,"I needed a sheath for my 18"" machete and based on reviews this unit seemed to be a good choice.The sheath is hard plastic with drainage holes situated along its entire length. The fit of my machete is good thickness wise with some play width wise, but this only pertains to my machete model to this sheath.There is a pivoting unit that when deployed, rubs against the machete edge. In my case it does not conform and only serves to damage my edge.Be aware that this is a GI type only, so for belt carry there is the standard GI web belt hooks mounted on a pivoting base. How durable this pivot point is remains to be seen. There is no provision for belt mounting other than the web belt hooks. The metal material appears cast and not quite up to milspec standards."
3,Useless sharpener,Somewhat sturdy construction. The sharpener doesn't sharpen....it scratches the blade. The belt clip is somewhat weak and easily bent to be useful. The perforations do a good job of keeping the blade dry and rust free.
1,Crap-Don't buy anything that has Type in the product name.,"Probably useful if you buy the military ""type"" belt. Not molle, the kind that hasn't been used by the military for a very long time. Also the metal button on the inside of the sheath that holds the belt clip will dig a nice groove into the blade the more it is used."
3,"Not bad, but not great.","I really wish Ontario would have made there own plastic sheath to go with there 18 inch Machete.This one is just Ok.My machete does fit, but a sloppy fit at best.It does have a military style clip, but it's useless for me (speaking of the clip).It's blade retention is a metal disk that rubs on the blade.So as you use it, it will eventually wear off the protective paint coating on the machete. I really don't like that.The method of blade retention is not mentioned anywhere in it's description.In all, it's just Ok. I probably wouldn't recommend this sheath to others."
3,A different book about Egypt,"This book is a fresh look at Egypt of today as well as great pictorial of Egypt of yesterday, Ancient Egypt. Beyond the realm of travel books, there aren't a lot of pictorials out there about Egypt that combine past and present, this is one of them, and probably the only one. I like it just for that. It has great pictures and some not so great pictures. The spreads are fantastic especially the one of the great pyramids, one of the largest I have seen published. I would buy it just for that picture. One downside of this book is its size, it is hard to fit it among other books due to its unusual landscape layout. Apart from that, if you can afford the hefty price get it. If you have other photo books on Egypt that you're really happy with, you can do without being US$60-75 short. I got to have a signed copy by the author so it was worth it. The author is one of Egypt's most established photographers."
3,hot!,"I absolutely love Panang. This doesn't taste like any panang I have ever had. First, it's VERY spicy. It's good, but it is HOT!I doctored it a lot, just to make it palatable, without burning my lips off! :)"
2,Too spicy!,"We love spicy food, but this was way too spicy (even for my husband, who is always ordering his food extra spicy). The flavor was pretty good, but we just couldn't handle the heat."
2,not my fav but...,..others may like it. I found the coriander to be overwhelming. Gave the product to a friend and they seemed to like it. If you are a fan of coriander/cilantro then you may like it. It seems pricey but it also makes quite a lot and appears that it would last a long long time (-:
5,Delicious,"Easy to use, has directions on the side. Arrived in good condition. Tastes good. Add chili for more spices."
2,Wizard: Pandering Fanboys Who Want You To Buy Worthless Crap,"ok, two comments:""Top it all off with an amazing cover featuring Batman with Wolverine and you have the ultimate official Jim Lee event...""funny thing is that the cover is just a composite of two previously published images""WOW! I have those two images of Batman and Wolverine separately! But ....now they're TOGETHER! Holy crap!""and""that only the editors of Wizard: The Comics Magazine could publish!""The editors of Wizard would publish Rob Liefeld's feces, so that isn't really a reason to buy this book"
1,Won't Play,"I tried four diffrent copies of this DVD, none of them played properly. They all skiped, froze, and wouldn't play certain chapters. I tried playing all of them in three diffrent players including a mac book pro. Where is the quality control? It's 2010, and not hard to make a DVD."
5,We love it!,My husband and I are working on conceiving our 2nd child and this product comes in handy. It's great and doesn't make a mess like some products. Very natural feeling too!
3,"Too slippery, but may help conception.","I decided to use this product because I had very little CM (that eggwhite consistency we're supposed to have) to be able to conceive. Each pouch contains too much of the product, which makes ""everything"" very slippery. I was using half everytime. Bottom line is, I don't know if it helped me to conceive or not, but I'm 8 weeks preggy now! Good luck to all."
1,did not work for me,"the day we stopped trying thing we got pregnat.Forget about it and leave nature do its work.My personal experience, hope work for you too."
3,weird,"Weird! very weird, you have to place the moisturizer inside yourself and it's not the same as a regular old KY...."
4,I conceived the first month I tried Pre-Seed,I conceived the first month I tried Pre-Seed. I think it is great. My only caution is that it also gave me a yeast infection (but I am very prone to them.)
5,worth a try,"AFter a miscarraige, it seemed strange that we could not get pregnant again after it seemed so easy the first two times. Perhaps we were more stressed than we thought but after trying Pre-seed, we got pregnant right away. state of mind or great product? i dont care, it was worth the 17 bucks."
5,It Definitely Works!!,My husband and I were going to give up trying to conceive because of the frustration and disappointment that we were hit with every month. I found out about Pre-Seed online and thought it was worth a shot. It amazing only took one time during my fertile cycle and I was pregnant! It is nothing short of a miracle. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to have a little bundle of joy!!
4,It really does work!,"This product really worked for us. Used this the 3rd month of trying to conceive and got pregnant right away! I tried it after a recommendation from a friend and reading a lot of positive reviews from other users. The theory is that this lubricant provides a ""sperm friendly"" environment that closely mimics body secretions.The only real problems with the product are:1. It is a bit pricey (you only get 8 applications)2. There is way too much in each applicator. A little goes a long way, and the leftover lubricant in the tube has to be thrown away (it does not contain any preservatives) so there is a lot wasted.Overall though, I would certainly recommend this product to anyone who is trying to conceive!"
5,It worked for us!,"I am convinced this product helped us conceive our baby. Despite what everyone says about using only a portion of the tube, we used the entire tube. Messy, but worth it. I got pregnant during the second month using Pre-seed and Clomid, and I am ""older."" We are using it again as we try for #2. I highly recommend this product."
2,yeast infections,"I was very hopeful, but this product gave me yeast infections both months we used it. :("
5,This stuff works...,"This is the first time I've ever used Pre-Seed and it doesn't give you the ""sticky"" feeling you can get with other intimate moisturizers. It hasn't gotten ME pregnant, but it got a couple ladies I know pregnant, so I'm definitely going to be using this for the entire time that I'm trying to conceive... Clomid can really do a job on a woman's cervical mucus, and Pre-Seed seems to be the popular remedy for that, so I'm all for it..."
2,Too Sticky,"Pre-Seed-Fertility-Friendly Intimate Moisturizer, 3 ApplicatorsI tried it for the first time the other night while TTC. It is REALLY sticky and quite uncomfortable. Not ""slippery"" as it claims."
2,Didn't really work for me,"I found no advantage in using this product vs. just doing things naturally. It was a hassle to stop and insert product and it was also messy. I'm sure it works for some couples, but we found it frustrating and unromantic, which kinda goes against its purpose."
1,Not for my sensitive tissues. .,"So we're trying to get pregnant and needed a conducive lube to facilitate, but unfortunately this made me feel like I was getting a yeast infection so I had to discontinue use."
4,works well!!,"Timely delivery, full satisfaction. This product really makes babydancing fun. It is a great product."
4,A little sticky,"I have seen a lot of women get pregnant using this product, so I feel confident that it is sperm-friendly like it says (even though I have yet to get pregnant after many cycles using it).What I don't love about it is that it can get a little sticky over time (in a lengthier session of use) - more so than traditional lubricants can. Adding water helps bring it back to slippery status, but it's kinda a pain. But, I'm sure it's worth it in the end!"
5,I got pregnant the first month using this!,"My hubby and I have been trying to get pregnant for about 10 months...1st month we used this...BAM! Pregnant! I don't know if it was this or not, but it sure didn't hurt anything! I used the whole tube, and didn't find it excessively messy. I also like the little packets as everyday lube. It's worth the money, IMO."
5,This stuff is great,"I love this product. Anybody who is trying to get pregnant, please try it! When my husband and I were ttc, I found out KY and other lubricants were not recommended (they are not sperm friendly). I then did some internet research and found out about pre-seed. I was skeptical at first. I read all the reviews and decided to try it despite the fact I found it a bit pricey. I found success the first time we used it!!! It is worth every penny. Thanks a bunch to the woman who discovered it. Pre-seed feels much more natural then other lubricants and the best part is that it is fertility friendly. I seriously recommend this to anyone who is ttc and experiencing a lack of the needed cervical fluid. Baby dust to all."
4,Simply good!,"My 2 year-old son loves this book, and it has been his new favorite bed-time book for the last 2 months. And, now he memorises the whole book. It's sweet how other animals (Penny's buddies) have been helping Penny and Penny gets to have her own new friends. I just love this book, just like my son does! To me, it's a bit sad, at the end, that Penny seems to let go of Pup too easily. But, it is a beautiful story after all."
2,It was ok.,"The book came in a timely manner. However, my main complaint would be that it did not come in the condition that was stated. It was supposed to be used-like new and when I opened it up it is yellow highlighter everywhere . Also, the front few pages are loose. I usually try to sell my books back once I have completed a course, but I seriously doubt I will be doing that with this book.If it would have come in the proper condition I would have rated you higher."
1,Misrepresented,"Seller described this item as ""binding perfect, no highlighting or writing, no wear on corners, appears as new."" Instead, the binding was completely separated from the book, I found underlining in the text, and the corners were bent/worn. I decided to spend more money on this ""like new"" textbook, but might as well have gone with a used copy."
1,Not so Good!,"I have ordered from Amazon for years now. I have bought and sold items. I have NEVER had such slow delivery in my life. I ordered the product on the 30th and did not get it until the 28th of the following month. It was being delivered IN STATE! I will probably try another seller, because this was a horrible experience. Sorry that I seem angry, but I am. I am in an 8 week course and got my book in the 5th week!!!!!"
1,Hard to Read and Let's get to the point,"I have this book for my Organizational Communications class and from the Prefix and 1st Chapter, I can see this will be a horribly boring class if all material is taken from this book. My biggest complaint is the typset is very small and a larger print is not offered. The sentences run on and on and on, get to the point. Also, this is text book only, as in the real world it doesn't work this way. Most people use email to communicate and that is the worst communication I have ever seen. Rarely do people meet face to face anymore and managers hide behind electronic communications and closed doors. This book is a pipe dream and I would really like to know where these types of communication are actually being used. I really wish college would teach real world principals. Paying a fortune to get my degree and I get offered a book like this to learn from, get real and a reality check."
1,Terrible Author,"This is a terribly written textbook. Unfortunately, one will purchase it because it is required for a course; but be prepared to have difficulty comprehending the stilted and formal language the author uses."
1,Not Super Type C,"As this paper has been discontinued, I was excited to see it for sale. My local store only has Fujicolor Type II now, so I ordered this, and waited 6 days for the package to get here, delaying any printing I had been hoping to do to wait to do it on my (discontinued) paper of choice. So, the package got here, and its Type II. I paid 15 dollars for shipping for something that I did not order, and waited 6 days for it to come.Anyways, I have heard that Type II is just like Super Type P, which I already have, and isn't that bad, just know what you are ordering when you order it."
5,This book is terrific.,This book was recommended by the writing program we use in kindergarten. It is a truly nice book. I am glad I found it online.
3,Only so-so,"I am also a long time Astro fan, but only found the book marginally enjoyable. The first 50 and last 50 pages of the book were more enjoyable when he told humorous stories about his playing and broadcasting days. However, he seemed to me to have lost a lot of his sense of humor when discussing his managerial days . . . perhaps reflecting what a strain the job was on him. I recommend the book, just wish he spent more time talking about his playing days. Also, it seems that he did not really right anything controversial, perhaps because he is still hoping for some kind of baseball job in the future. C'mon, he can't tell me that in the 5 years he managed, he didn't run across at least one prima donna player or front office type that deserves trashing!"
3,Some good parts.,"Read a review from ESPN praising the book and then read a sample. The book seemed to be a total winner. After reading it, I would give it a thumbs up but not great. The vocabulary used by Dierker was inconsistent - sometimes straight baseball talk while other times, a bit flowery and poetical. ESPN was impressed by this style but I found it distracting. The book has no set path as Dierker talks about many different things in an unarranged order. Still worth reading though if you are a baseball fan."
5,"""There is nothing quite so worth doing...""","It's been a long time since I first read ""Wind in the Willows,"" but rereading this version with my three-year-old has been a wonderful, rewarding experience. I'm not sure how much editing Inga Moore has done, but she has certainly retained the essence of the story while making it more easily accessible to the young reader (or, in our case, listener). And her illustrations are delightful; the images of Ratty, Mole, Otter, Mr. Toad and Badger with which my daughter will grow up are virtually perfect. Moreover, by dividing the story into two slimmer volumes she has made it easier for a parent to read it to a child. I can't say enough about this wonderful edition of ""Wind in the Willows,"" but I encourage parents -- or grandparents or aunts or uncles or friends -- to buy it for the next generation of readers."
1,This book left me scratching my head,"I have to recommend STRONGLY against this book for several reasons.First off, it is very poorly written. It almost seems like it was written in another language. (I understand that the story is loosely based on the Magic Railroad movie, which has caused some controversy among Thomas-purists.) The role of Mr. Conductor and his ""gold dust"" is never explained, nor is Thomas' trip on the Magic Railroad to get Lady ever described.In addition, as the 2 previous reviewers stated below, the ""mood"" of the book was very mean and threatening. Diesel 10 is a thoroughly unpleasant character, with no redeeming qualities.Save your money - there are plenty of other good Thomas books out there that teach such concepts as sharing, problem resolution and hard work in a more entertaining and appropriate manner.I'd like to use some of that ""gold dust"" and send this book back to the store!"
1,Straight to Garbage Can,"This is an awful book for children. The spirit of this book is mean and there is no good message. ""Destroy the steamies"" and ""hate"" are the common themes and Diesel ends up dying in the end by falling off a broken bridge. I bought this for my 4-year old who is a huge Thomas fan, however, threw it straight in the garbage after reading it. I wouldn't read to a child of any age...."
2,Way Out There,"This is a Magic Railroad adventure. That means that while it uses characters from the Thomas stories by Rev. Awdry, they have been lifted from ""reality"" and moved to a world that includes magic.Diesel 10, a strange mean engine that is, for some unknown reason, equipped with a giant claw, has decided he wants to get rid of the steam engines. Mr. Conductor has been left in charge of the yard but he has lost his sparkle and needs more gold dust. Are you with me? Well, Toby and Thomas get involved, there is a chase and we meet Lady, who Thomas has brought back from the Magic Railroad. Lady is the source of the gold dust Mr. Conductor needs.Our kids like this book but we (parents) don't like it as much as the more ""real"" Thomas adventures. This book uses drawings instead of stills from the show so it has a different look from the other softcover books. If your child likes Thomas and the Magic Railroad, they will probably really like this one."
1,Couldn't Be Worse,I agree with the majority of other reviewers who disliked this book. It is poorly written with a terrible plot and an emphasis on meanness. Some reviewers have given it 5 stars because their child likes it. My son is 2 and loves it but that isn't enough for me. Reading the nasty dialog makes me uncomfortable and I can't get past the numerous unexplained events. I don't care if it is based on some movie version of the Thomas TV series. Save your money for another of the many high-quality Thomas books that are available.
1,An awful story!,"This story was not in line with ANY other Thomas the Train stories. It was really an awful story with Diesel 10 ....well, getting hurt or dying, or something! It's never quite clear, but obviously SOMETHING happens to him and the rest of the trains obviously don't care b/c he was so mean in the story. I gave this to my son for his 3rd birthday last week and hadn't read it before I wrapped it. Very sorry I purchased it, am actually going to put it in the trash. There's no good lesson or even decent story in this book. Don't buy it!"
1,"Horrible: violent, mean characters and sinister plot","I am incredulous. THIS piece of garbage is a Thomas the Tank Engine story? THIS??!! Thomas stories are generally about simple human mistakes that are easy for young children to understand and learn from. This story ""Diesel 10"" brings shame on the Thomas stories. Diesel 10 is violent and has an enormous scary claw. He makes threats against life and property, and the story has a sinister and meandering plot that ends with Lady and Thomas actually running for their lives. This story has no redemption at all.I'm not taking this book back to the store. It's going in the garbage.PS This book is supposed to be based on a movie about the magic railroad (a ridiculous concept clearly created just to make money). The original Thomas stories are wonderful just because they're so simple like children themselves. If this book is any reflection at all of the movie, my children will never see it."
1,poor quality,This may be the worst thing I've purchased from Amazon. It kept really lousy time until it broke. The button you use to change the time came out and wouldn't go back in. Amazon only takes returns for 30 days--you'd think they'd stand by a watch for more than 30 days given the price. I later found out Invicta has an awful reputation. Avoid Invicta at all costs.
5,Dr. Dallori's Bride by Carol Wood (Large Print Mills & Boon Hardcover),"Description from the book back cover:The Italian doctor - and the single mum. For the last six months Dr. Antonio Dallori has tried to forget about Laura Bright. He only met her once, and was instantly intrigued by their chance encounter. So he's elated when Laura returns to the village as his new practice nurse! Laura is incredibly attracted to Antonio, but she has a baby to think of now. She's not willing to risk their security by having a relationship, though Laura quickly realises that Antonio wants to tempt her down the aisle ...THE ITALIAN DOCTORS - The Dallori brothers - they're looking for a bride!"
5,Just the Best!,"I have been brewing for many years and scorn my college buddies for drinking sub-par beer. Upon reading this book, I could not get over the myriad of recipes available. I do not know how the authors did it, but they have the recipe for my favorite beer, Samuel Smith's Taddy Porter. This beer has been has been emptying my wallet, as it is priced at $13.00 a six pack. When I studied abroad in England, it was called Nourishing Strong Stout. I am just soooooooo excited to see such an informative and well-laid out book. Cannot wait until Clone Brews II. Bottle caps off to the authors, Tess and Mark Szamatulski!"
2,Not for me,"I wasted my money. I thought this book would show recipes for cloning large commercial brewery brews like Bud, Keystone, Coors, Kokanee, etc., not the smaller Micro Brewerys. I can come up with my own Micro Brew beers. Again, I wasted my money."
4,"wide variety of recipes, something for everyone","Here you have 150 recipes for beers from around the world, I didn't even know some of those places drank beer! Each recipe is presented with three brewing methods; extract, mini-mash and All-grain. Looks like a wide range of styles tastes and flavors to try but not really enough information for a complete novice to work with, if you're on a limited book budget I'd recommend getting the Szamatulski's second book ""Beer Captured"" instead."
4,doubles are good,"The recipes are easy to follow, and tasty. Overall a great book. Try it yourself. A definite must for the zymurgist's library."
3,Not a bad book,"I was expecting the clones to be more well known beers. They did a nice job with the ones they presented but a lot of the content in there are beers ive never heard of. Pick it up for a nice recipe book, but don't expect it to tell you how to make your favorite beer."
3,Ok but I have beter home brew books,The biggest problem is that I have only heard of about 6 of the beers that were in there. There are no recipes for any of the big breweries. The good news is that the book gives very good tips on how to clone beer. Some of the beers I made were pretty good. Some that I have not tried yet looked like they would be very good. Exstensive brewing knowlege is needed to understand what they are talking about. Not a beginer book.
4,"Beer varieties from around the world, not quite for novice","While not quite as good as their later book ""Beer Captured"", I'd give this book about 31/2 stars for the amount of information it contains (the Szamatulski's 2nd book is even more detailed hence the lower rating). You get a variety of recipes from all over the world including countries you might not expect to even allow alcohol. I've never brewed beer but I'd say that this book would do pretty well for extract, mini mash or all grain method brewers who have a good idea of what they're doing. While there is some introductory information and some more in the appendices I really don't think the total novice(like me) should rely on this book alone. How close are the cloned recipes?, I don't know but expect that most of us couldn't tell the difference."
2,"Be skeptical, very skeptical","Skip this, start with Brewing Classic Styles. A friend gave me his copy of this book. I'm an all-grain, German lager brewer with a German wife, so I get to explore German beer roots. This book may have been great in its day, but....with more malt varieties available today, better software, and more US brewing knowledge, this book hurts more than it helps. It need specific instructions for all grain, not just a side caption adjusting for the base malt. BTW, Munich needs to be mashed. Give me malt percentages, not real weights base on your efficiency...a book should save me that extra math. ""Crystal 40"" does not belong in German beer. Give me Caramunich II or something from Weyermann. No wonder my friend gave up home brewing and gave me his book. Does no favors to someone getting started."
4,clone brews,"what a great book. The authors give you 3 skill levels to work from along with some very tasty brews to chose, making this a very usable read.with easy to follow recipes I have managed to make a few really good beers that I like,while saving a few dollars to. My first ale from the book is headed to the state fair this year (it's that good). A nice resource for someone who doesn't have a local brew store or access to other local brewers..."
5,Impressed,"I'm rather impressed with this book. I'm a HUGE fan of Magic Hat #9, Yuengling Porter, and also Murphy's Irish Stout. ALL three recipes are in here.. I'm excited to give them a try.My worldly friend was floored to see some of the import recipes he drank when on his travels, so he's excited for me to brew a few of them.Thanks for the most excellent book. DOWN WITH DISTRIBUTORS - LET'S ALL DRINK HOMEBREW!!"
3,Don't waste your money.,"Although I was very displeased with this book I will give credit where credit is due. The recipes were well laid out with conversions from extract to mini-mash and all-grain. The perfect book for brewers of all experience levels. However, out of the 150 comercial recipes, most of them were very obscure brands. Most of which I have never even heard of. Bangkok Thailand, Seoul South Korea, Singapore, India, China and Nigeria are just a few of the countries they picked from. There are a few good ones however. Like Sam Adams, Yuengling Porter, Bass Ale, Anchor Steam, Guiness Extra Stout, Fosters Lager. But if you're hoping for a whole lot of beers you're farmiliar with this is not the book for you."
2,Leave it at home,"I took this guide book as well as the Lonely Planet toTunisa for a month. I could have easily gotten along with just the Planet, and it's smaller to lug around. The Rough Guide was often either vague, or the information was so wrong that I got the impression that some of the places written about were never actually visited by the writter. Directions were hard to follow and the layout of information was not nearly as concise as the Planet Guide. I was tempted to ditch this book many times along the way as it really wasn't worth the space it took up in my pack."
5,Great addition to my 3 burner stove and griddle,This bag is great for my 3 burner stove( GB-90 ) by Camp Chef! Griddle fits in perfectly as well. There's plenty of room for it as well as the wind screen. No need to by the additional bag for the griddle. Zippers are well constructed and pull handle very sturdy. Rolls very easily. Sure beats carrying it around. Wheels are hard plastic but looks very stout and durable.
5,Good covers,"These covers are substantially made of heavy, quality canvas. Workmanship is great and they fit the appliance perfectly. Are a ""must have"" for the Camp Chef RCB90."
2,Did I get a lemon?!?!,"All of these reviews seem to be very positive. While I love my Camp Chef 90 and it's accompanying hardward, this bag is junk. Within two uses, both wheels fell off. Where the wheels were attached by stitching to the bag, the stitching had essentially come unstitched. Maybe I have a lemon or maybe folks are liking the look and not really using it. I continue to use it as it is a handy bag and fits the stove perfectly, I can no longer roll it and must pick up this monster...lucky for my better half!"
2,juvenilia,"The only reason to read this book is to complete your tour through Malraux. Just look at the author photo and you'll know all about the sort of bombastic, turgid existential nonsense that fills its pages.How the author of the foreword could describe the novel as a ""fierce critique of colonialism"" is truly baffling. The southeast asians are so thoroughly dehumanized that most readers will think of Conrad. Malraux, though, has nothing like Conrad's control of narrative.One thought: The novel concludes with a kind of extended death scene, a meditation on last moments more characteristic, ironically, of the cultural wisdom found in the traditions that its heroes are vandalizing."
2,Too much personal musings,I would not recommend this for the layman. The author is telling too many of her own stories.
1,"repeat, repeat","Boring! Silly subject matter, says the same thing over and over. Unfortunately, it was for a class so I had to buy it."
4,Excellent step by step guide to complete restoration,"well organized, thoughtful clear illustrations and photographs with sufficient information to guide you through a bumper to bumper restoration. Includes excellent resource index."
4,"Not a must-have, but I'm glad I bought it.","This book has some good step-by-step information on how to restore a car. If you are a first time restorer, or just someone who wants to keep his/her classic running and looking nicer, I recommend it. I have been working on old cars for quite a while, so I really didn't learn much from this book. However, it was nice to learn that I have been doing things right all of these years. I'm glad I bought this book."
5,Top of the line,"This is my second of the same model, my first lasted over six years.I do not believe I could do any better than that.Its a good buy."
4,Looks nice and works well but...,"I purchased this UPS as a backup for my CPAP machine. It's very capable of doing the job. The LCD, and information it provides is very helpful, and appears to be accurate. You can't beat the feature set on this UPS for the price. My only real complaint is with the smell of the plastic. It will fill the room with an awful stink when this thing warms up. I'm guessing it will go away as the unit breaks in, but really shouldn't be there to begin with. I have noticed that many of the products that come from China these days have a problem with stinky plastic."
1,Watch Out !!! early deaths & no warranty,"See the reviews for the 1000W unit. These have a nasty tendency to die early. Failure mode is intermittent shut-off. Just exactly what you're trying to prevent. I have two of them, and one just decided to switch itself off whenever it felt like it. The factory offered me a 20% discount to buy another one. NO repair option - - these are throwaway units.I can understand a battery going out or a circuit failing, but an intermittent shutdown is not acceptable, nor is the no-warranty, no-repair, thank you sir I'll have another attitude. TrippLite has lost my business.UPDATE: my second unit has now failed, making for 100% failure rate within 2 years. Failure symptom is the same - it just shuts itself off without warning. Both of the units I bought are completely useless, totally defeating the purpose of a UPS. I could understand the failure mode being less and less battery life during backup - - but this total shutdown is totally unacceptable."
2,Having troubles with the unit,The unit discharged its battery when it was first plugged in. It now will not come back on to recharge the battery.
4,Audio Lag.....,"First of all, I bought this for playing games on the computer, recording video was just a bonus. Hookup & driver installation was painless and the software interface is very straightforward. The video does not lag although I only tested it with a PSX and Castlevania SOTN. The only problem I have is that the audio starts to lag after a bit of play. It gets off by about 3 seconds. The strange thing is, if you record your gameplay or whatever and playback the video, the audio is synched up! I've searched Adaptec's knowledge base with no answers & have seen people posting in forums that they had the same problem. It's not an issue with my PC as my system specs over-exceed the minimum & recommended requirements. If Adaptec can fix this audio issue, they'd definitely get 5 stars from me."
2,video and audio lag,"Gamebridge installed easily. However the best video quality was achieved using dscaler software, not the included software. Reason for buying was using with xbox360. When playing the games, there was a lag of about a second or less. Disasterous when playing on line. The video quality was not as good as other capturing devices. It appears that this is probably the closest you'll be able to get to playing in real time on a laptop. If capturing is what you want, spend a little more on another device. If gaming is what you want, you'll be dissapointed."
3,havent been able to try it yet because,"there is no Vista Supporti repeat, DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE VISTA!there is no vista drivers available, nor will there be any released.i have yet to try this on an XP computer, form what im reading, it works well."
4,Does What it is supposed to do.,"I usually don't write reviews, just buy. This product works as advertised. I got the whole thing up and running on my laptop in about 10 minutes. I run my PS2 on it and it works great. If you want to have your game console with you while you travel and use a laptop to play it, this is definitely the product to buy."
2,Audio lag problem,"Okay, as long as you can find a way to pipe your audio in without the game bridge this thing will work fine for you. As others have said, this device will lag the audio (by quite a bit, more than 3 seconds) of any signal it feeds, which is odd because the video part works fine. Browsing adaptecs website for this issue is no help, and there doesnt seem to be any updated drivers or any way at all to fix the problem.Most everything ive tried to use it for, ive been able to route around this problem by sending the sound into the line-in on my soundcard. But it is an extra step that shouldnt be necessary, and also makes the device completely useless as a TV tuner.I gave it 2 stars because it isnt -quite- bad enough to rate rock bottom, but it is close."
2,Not so useful,"Not nearly as good, useful, or comprehensive as A Field Guide to American Houses by McAlester."
5,excellent cause; excellent anthology,"The proceeds from this anthology go to help Save the Children's Tsunami Relief Fund; so purchasing the collections is a worthy endeavor. However, if that alone cannot motivate readers, the twenty-three short stories written by some of the best of speculative fiction writers on the market today are almost all excellent with no subpart submissions. The contributors obviously motivated by the cause diligently kept the bar at the highest quality level. The tales run the gamut of fantasy and science fiction to include a dangerous trek into fairy land, a lethal march with the military in space and an even more dangerous joy ride around a future Los Angeles. Whether the stories star alien species, mythological creatures, immortals; whether they are comedic; satiric (just ask Macbeth), or seriously cautionary all are terrifically entertaining.Harriet Klausner"
4,Good not great!,"All in all a decent collection of tales. The reason I purchased it was for the ""Dune"" story which alone, justifies the buy. Oh, and it's for a good cause, too.............."
2,Disappointed,There were so many different authors - with not much in common as far as topics or themes. The stories were so short that it left much to be desired as far as plot and character development. It really was a waste of time for me.
5,Sold!,"Bought this book for my brother after his son got seriously ill, and since he lives in England UK had it sent through the English Amazon :)He was actually quite sceptical about Feng Shui (unlike me) but willing to try anything to help his son get better.Happy to say the book arrived quickly and my brother is now sold on many of the concepts, and found it a very interesting read. My nephew has not yet made a full recovery but we live in hope.Thanks!"
2,disappointed,"This is an extensive re-review of basic Feng Shui, and has very little to do with Health as mentioned in the title."
5,george,"I received the Steamlight flash light as a fathers day gift, and found that it was perfect for use when traveling. I purchased a 12 volt adaptor so I can keep it charged any where I go. The base holds the flash light securely so there is no worry if it has made contact and is charging, it also is very well constructed.I'm getting a second set-up for my work truck that can mounted in the cab."
1,Misleading,I feel like the picture for this item was intentionally misleading as it does not include the cords. Ofcourse I should have read the description more closely and reading the reviews would have been helpful but I was in a hurry and made a mistake in buying this. As I read through the reviews I could not believe how many people left high marks but had the same issue.
1,Don't buy it,"If you going to buy this product, don't throw away your old charger because this charger does not have a wire to charge. I never knew that if you buy a charger then you have to used your old wire. The seller needs to state that on his or her products profile ."
1,Not worth it,"The DVD covers will not even fit in the sleeves provided. Realizing I'm tearing up my covers plus I can't see my DVDs in the thing, it wasn't worth using it. I find better ones at Walmart."
1,Not Recommended,Not worth the cheap price. Very cheap materials and I ended up just getting rid of it.
3,"Roomy, but Bulky","We purchased this free after rebate so we are not out anything, but we were looking for a solution such as this to house all of our PS2 games and their inserts. The claim is 40 disc capacity but it is only that if you put 2 discs in many of the pages. When completely filled (which ours is), it is one bulky giant. So much so that we have to be very careful when opening/closing the zipper so as not to mess-up any of our inserts.Again, we got it for free so we're not out anything. We are still looking for a good solution for our PS2 games and inserts. Perhaps a binder of some sort will not be as constricting."
1,does not play,"The case says ""RIGOLETTO"". The dvd says ""rigoleto"". When I insert into my dvd player it does not play. I tried to play in another dvd player, the same SILENCE."
3,The Tragedy of Rigoletto,"And the tragedy is that there is no decent performance of this opera available. The sets in this production are acceptable but later productions are more attractive. As the Duke Domingo cannot be bettered and Cotrubas is a touching Gilda. The other members of the cast are fine as well except for the title role. MacNeil is simply inadequate, his tone dry and forced and frequently under pitch. Its very painful to see him struggle through this performance. His presence ruined the whole opera for me. The Met certainly should have been able to find a more suitable singer to portay this all important role. His work is not at a professional level at this stage of his career. Terrible, terrible, terrible!"
4,A blast from the past!,"This is a fun trip back in time. Carman provided a unique glimpse into Scripture with his particular stye of music and entertaining. His songs were powerful, meaningful and clearly heart-felt. I doubt anyone will ever view the story of Lazarus the same way after seeing Carman's rendition. Good clean fun and enjoyable for the whole family.I would recommend this."
5,good product as descrived,order recived on time as said exect product as descrived thank you always recomend to friend and family members.microwave working fine
5,work like new,"Made my microwave work like new, installation quick and easy no modifications required three screws and a plug. saved the price of a new microwave."
3,Amazonian Ecology,"Emilio Moran's book could reasonably be called the most recent definitive anthropological work on the Amazonian region. In addition to the ecological analysis, it encompasses a huge amount of secondary research. This book is meticulously detailed, and is also quite well written, but is not especially accessible to a general audience. Without a basic background in the Amazonian region or at least in ecology in general, the reader will have a hard time following Moran's arguments."
5,very informational,This book is very nicely done lots of nice clear big pictures of the fruits and vegetables that are described giving a nice few paragraphs of each individual fruit or vegetable. this book is used at my place at work i work in a produce department and have showed it to our customers to instruct them on which was the hottest pepper or sweetest apple. it doesn't show all the different types of fruits (there are hundreds of varieties of apples)and vegetables but shows the one that are usually available and most popular at most supermarkets i myself have learned a lot from this book. a very good purchase.
5,Worth Every Penny,"The CD was exactly what was needed for the young ladies who needed the music. The girls however lost the CD before time to use it, but that was not the CD's fault. However I ordered a downloadable version from Desi Karaoke and they ripped me off for 20 bucks, so beware anyone of Desi Karaoke."
5,Music's Best Kept Secret,"Most artists can make pretty good CDs when they have all the musicians, production tricks and second chances available in the studio but not all of them can quite pull it off in a live performance. James McMurtry is definitely NOT one of those. Good as his recordings are, he's better live. And he does it with only two people behind him. I bought ""Live In Aught 3"" at the door on my way out of his show in Little Rock in November. It was like taking the show home with me. I've driven back roads, drank beer and built fences to this CD. It just don't get a whole lot better. The standout song on this album, for me at least, is ""Lights of Cheyene."" Performed solo. Just JM and that ""great big ol'"" red acoustic Guild. If you're new to James McMurtry's music, start with this one and work your way backwards. It's well worth the trip."
4,Play this one loud and leave room for jumping about,"James McMurtry is sometimes characterized more as a songwriter than a performer, and he has penned a number of songs that chronicle the lives and times of those who are living on the fringes and those marginalized. But his earlier studio work has not ranked as among my favorites, sometimes seeming as though he would rather be doing something else, maybe writing.But on ""Live in Aught-Three,"" Mr. McMurtry throws down the gauntlet and invigorates his songs with the crisp energy and brisk pace they deserve. More than once, McMurtry and his backing duo the Heartless Bastards-drummer Daren Hess and bassist Ronnie Johnson-cut loose with that kind of special, focused intensity the best power trios bring to live sets. The slower numbers offer a nice respite and bring balance to this collection of live shows from four venues.Yes, it's almost a cliche, but play this one loud and leave some room for folks to jump about."
3,"well, it's called sabriel, right?","er....what can i say? well...it was fairly good, but i have definitely read better.recommend it? well, since i've got it, can't say that i don't.let's just say i prefer his keys to the kingdom series. i think thursday is coming out this year."
2,Not just for kids...,"If you're put off by the ""fact"" that this book is written for ""children and young adults"" - don't be. I'm looking at a 1977 edition of ""A Wizard of Earthsea"" by Ursula K LeGuin, which is, according to the publisher ""for readers of eleven or older"".Garth Nix is a good writer whose books are accessible by children as well as by adults - this is something to be applauded. Sabriel is an original classic and I'm looking forward to the sequels.Check out Shade's Children for an equally-spooky but different premise entirely..."
1,don't waste your time,this book is excedingly boring and uneventful. i thought this book sounded intresting enough but i couldnt have been more wrong. i was already 80% into the book when any real excitement came into the story and then we went back to being boring as heck 2 minutes later. characters were probably too logical for a fantasy story and whoever heard of a female heroine falling in love with another character but only spending about 10 minutes with him total?! thats utterly ridiculous. you want my advice? save time and money and dont even bother with this book.
5,Slow Start...but...,"I admit it kinda started out slow...but it ended with a bang! The book was perfect! I love the characters and the world that Garth Nix has created in Sabriel, it's sequel: Lirael, and the upcoming book Abhorsen. I can think of one word that explains Garth Nix ideas...perfect."
5,"What an incredible, imaginative, and totally awesome book!","I really enjoyed reading this book! Great plot, wonderfully developed characters - Overall an awesome book, complete with real-life randomness! It was AWESOME."
5,Amazing book!,"I first read this book years ago and immediately fell in love with it. I reread it recently for a course in school and remembered why I thought it was so fantastic in the first place. The heroine Sabriel is easily relatable as someone who is trying to figure out who they are and where they belong. It's a novel of growing up and making it on your own for the first tine, even though she feels completely unprepared from this transition from student to someone with responsibility. All of the secondary characters are memorable, from Sabriel's father, to her teacher and to Mogget who is clearly more then he seems. This book is a wonderful beginning to a great trilogy, it sucks you in and makes you want to find out how the characters journey ends."
4,Really fun read,Really fun read with a bunch of good characters living in a complex world doing interesting things. I love the idea of the Necromancers' Bells!
4,Sabriel,A really good book; exciting and makes you want to know what's going to happen. Recommended!!!
3,A Pretty Good Fantasy Series,"Garth Nix's Abhorsen Trilogy is a pretty good series with a satisfactory plot full of action and suspense, but I think his characters lack depth. I feel that there are some flaws in Nix's writing and sometimes it almost seems like Nix feels like he needs to get the story out and doesn't care how he gets there. I often found myself looking for more emotion and feeling in his books. If you are looking for more depth and emotion in the characters as you read a fantasy novel, I suggest reading Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series."
5,An old favorite...,"I can't remember the first time I read this book, but I feel like it's always been a favorite of mine. I love the world of Abhorsen so much. I also love zombies. And magic. And waterfalls. And cats. This book has all of the above. So yeah, I love it.The romance between the two main characters Sabriel and Touchstone may be a little rushed, and kind of has the whole ""all-the-sudden-we're-madly-in-love"" thing going on, but I blame it on the fact that the story isn't focused on the love story, so we just don't see them falling in love. Instead, the plot is all about saving the Old Kingdom and Ancelstierre.And Mogget anyone? Best character -ever-. There is nothing like a snarky white furball to make a good book even better.I would really love to read a book set in the same world but a hundred or so years in the future. Lirael and Abhorsen are okay, but really don't do Sabriel justice. Sabriel will always be my favorite."
5,Creative and Exciting,"From the opening page to the last sentence, Sabriel pulls you in and refuses to let go.The background of the Old Kingdom is explained flawlessly and completely without getting bogged down in paragraphs of history. Details are explained by Nix quickly enough to keep you going, but slowly enough to keep you wanting more.Characters are not cliché or flat and manage to be ultimately human in their struggles and flaws. Their grand adventure is well paced through the novel and, despite increasing elements of the fantastic, their narrative and nature become more believable as the story goes on.Breaking away from traditional fantasy world models, Nix creates a mythology that is brand new and utterly exciting."
5,One of my favorite books by my favorite author!,"I first read this book when I was about 12 and have reread it multiple times. It never fails to fascinate and inspire me, and every time I recommend this book to a friend they love it. It's definitely one of those books that you can't put down. It's in a league of its own and it's one of the books that first inspired my love of reading and especially fantasy! Adults and teens alike can enjoy this trip into one of the most exciting worlds you'll ever encounter!"
2,Boring,Read this book because of all the great reviews. Good world but really need more info as to how the bells etc and how all the creepy people work. Characters are flat and there doesn't ssem to be enough people in the world to flesh out the reality. Wouldn't recommend it and won't read the next one. May not even try to read any other of Nix's books. I am an adult and read a lot of fantasy.
3,Good,"Though enetertaining (I read it in two days) some things were a bit too predictable. For example, Touchstone's identity. He himself gave the clue by leaving something out of one of his explanations. But it wasn't bad."
2,"Poor, Completcated, Lost","I didn't like this book in the slightest. first off it began too quickly. the author just threw you into a world completely different than our own with very little explanation. He talked about Charter marks and all sorts of odd things that weren't very well explained. And most of all he didn't define the problem clearly. I think Garth Nix had a great idea, he was excited about all the things he could do with his book and then quickly drew them out on paper, not bothering ot explain anything to the reader. don't get me wrong, I'm not one that likes pages and pages of explanations, but I would like to know a little more about the charcaters, the problem before he's already searching for an explanation.I wouldn't recomend this book at all."
5,One of my all time Favorites,"Sabreil is a book that takes you to a whole new world, but keeps some real-life details.The book begins slow(I think) but takes off after a couple of chapters when Sabreil has to journey into death to save her father, picking up two friends along the way(Mogget-a demon thing trapped inside the form of a cat and touchstone-a man who was a royal guard before being trapped in death.)This book is filled with fun,adventure, and a little romance. All the condiments of a great book."
5,Blown away!,"Sabriel is one of the best books i have read all year. The characters are extremely vivid. It is a very believable book. The plot is very intense, you just can't put it down!"
5,Mesmerizing...,"I've read and listened to all of the Abhorsen books by Garth Nix - one of the best trilogies of all time. It is put forth as a young adult fiction...but so is Tolkien, so what does that tell you. If you like the books, check out the audio versions. The reader is Tim Curry, who absolutely makes the characters. Or go straight to the audio books - check out [...] for the downloads.I can re-read this triology over and over and get something new each time.jp"
4,Deeply mysterious and captivating,Garth Nix drew me into this strange new world and made me a part of it. The magnificent characters and witty commentary were captivating. I couldn't but the book down. I recommend this to any teenager who loves to read and explore new worlds.
5,One of the Best Trilogies out there!,I must thank Mr Garth Nix for solifiying my appreciation for this genre. I read thisbook as a teenager and could not put it down. This book has truly stayed with me and is one I don't mind re-reading. I have since completed my collection and read the entire trilogy. It has remained on my bookshelf for over 10 years now. Unique and interesting story and characters. He pulls you into their world! Highly recommended!
5,"Literally, one of the best books to read when its raining, lol","It's a very, very well crafted introduction to what is one of my personal favorite trilogies. An amazing tale of a headstrong girl becoming a woman, all the while having to fight the dead and those who work to bring the dead back. An adventure and a mystery. Wonderful novel, recommended to anyone who can read."
4,Read it you wont regret it!,"I read this book when I had nothing better to do...And I loved it. This book should be read by everyone from Fantasy fanatics (Like me!) to anyone with hands to pick up a book.It starts out with Sabriel a 18ish teenager on the ""Normal"" side of a magical border called Ancelstierre. She receives a cryptic message from her father Abhorsen that calls her over to the ""Magical"" side of this world called 'The Old kingdom. And it leads her on a very interesting quest.She is joined by a Cat that's not really a cat named Mogget who is a variety of things or rather in his own words, ""I have a variety of names... You may call me Mogget. As to what I am, I was once many things, but now I am only several...""I personally loved the cat and so will you...So read itand the sequal 'Lirael' isnt bad either"
5,Sabriel,"This book is wonderful. It is probably one of the best books I have ever read. Garth Nix writing style is absolutely beatiful. Although the story is a little complicated it is all easy to understand. I would definitely recommend Lirael and Abhorsen as well although Sabriel is probably my favorite of the three. Everything you could possibly want in a good book is included in Sabriel. Beautiful description, romance, adventure, fantasy...EVERYTHING! READ THIS BOOK! IT IS ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE EVER READ!"
5,thrilling,"The necromancers in Sabriel make the book new and interesting as the book does not follow the ""Tolkien plot"" so common in the fantasy books of the present. The dead make this book and the rest in the series so much more exciting."
1,Fell asleep reading because it was so boring.,I read this book on reccomendation from friends. I found it thoroughly boring. It talked to much about death.It was one of the worst books that I have ever read.
2,Tedious,"I think the author was going for mysterious but it's just confusing. Too many unexplained references, too many unanswered questions. Sabriel herself doesn't know what's going on most of the time. It's dark and there isn't a lot of character development. Most of it was pretty boring. There were a few good parts, and I did finish it, but it was a chore. And the ending was unsatisfying. I'm left with a ""Seriously? That's it?"" feeling but I don't want to have to read book two so I'm just going to let it go."
5,The Best!! My fav!!,"I read this book when I was 12 years old, and I still read it!! It's a wonderful book! I recommend it to ANYONE who wants a good read! You'll love it! It deserves way more than 5 stars!"
2,Problem with Kindle Formatting,"Five stars for content, 2 for formatting. At the very beginning of the book,after Abhorsen has brought the baby back from the dead, he's asked what her name will be. In my edition (this edition) the text says:""Sabriel With Bonus Material.""Hello?"
5,Awesome magical mideval times meets the 1930's,"This trilogy is awesome. I first came across it when my Dad gave me the hard copy of Sabriel which he got from a library book sale. It's extremely entertaining and the 2 different worlds or rather three different worlds in this series are well developed. I lost my hard copy, so I decided to buy the kindle version. I've read it and the rest of the trilogy multiple times. It's one of those stories you can keep coming back to."
5,Sabriel,"Sabriel was a great read, I keep it when I move to read again! It's a throwback for me because I remember reading this book in middle school, and loved it then as well. I had the book on tape, which sadly isn't as gripping as the novel itself. Maybe I'm biased, but I feel like reading the book would be better."
5,wonderful world and fantasy tale,"This is a wonderful fantasy novel for both juvenile readers and well rounded, mature book enthusiasts. I personally read a lot of fantasy books and the first of the Abhorsen trilogy has an unique world where ancient magic lays on the other side of The Wall in the Old Kingdom, where Sabriel's father has no name, for he is known only as his title, The Abhorsen. Her youth adds a beautiful tone to the epic journey to find her father, all the while grappling with The Dead and learning how to apply the lessons in Charter Magic and from the Book of the Dead as a real necromancer in an old world."
5,THIS BOOK IS THE BOMB FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE FANTASY!!!!!!,I really loved this book. It was soo kool. Im 14 and my friends and I really love fantasy.A friend of my Moms gave it to me and i adored it. Its about this 18 year old girl who has a very interesting familiy history. She is next in line to become an Abhorsen. It tells a story of her journey to find her father and her struggles and triumphs along the way. Its filled with lots of little hints that keep you guessing. I really reccommend this book for everyone who like a good story and a fantasy twist.
2,Yawn - Fantasy Without The Good Parts,"I read all of the wonderful reviews, and I was absolutely ecstatic to get this book... and then I read it. It has interesting imaginative features, I agree, but whilst the characters were going through all these perils, I didn't give a whit. I didn't care about any of the characters, and I attribute this to lack of character development - Sabriel has no personality, it seems. Sure, she is flawed like the rest of the characters, but she just doesn't have enough emotional depth to be likable. That's where this book has failed, and it bored me absolutely to tears, fantasy lover as I am."
5,Read this book!,"Sabriel was one of the best books I've ever read. I stayed up all night reading it because I just couldn't put it down. Garth Nix is a very original writer. I had never heard of him until now. I bought the book because of it's unusual cover. Nix has a very unique style of writing you don't see much. There were hardly any of those dull moments in this book; the kind where it goes on and on with description. It reads like a nightmare, which keeps it interesting. There's always a new challenge the doesn't seem to be resolved until the next page, which keeps you turning. As for being called ""young adult"", I don't know where they came up with that. This definatly could be enjoyed by children and adults alike. I'm very anxious for a sequel, but in the mean time I'll be reading some of his other books. To make a long paragraph short, you need to read this book!"
5,"Harken to the bells, they ring for thee","This is a new Author for me, and I am impressed, the story line is fairly simple, straight forward, us against the really bad guy,lacking the multiple sub plots that can sometimes be distracting. I like the original form of magic used here too. There is plenty of action and cliff hangers to keep you turning pages. My only complaint is the use of the word Charter as a noun and an adjective without ever fully explaining the true nature of Charter magic. Maybe it will be explained more as we continue in book two. I bought the box set trilogy and I am glad I did."
4,Start it today!,"How have i never heard of Garth Nix before?How have you never heard of Garth Nix before? (My wife says she's heard of Garth Nix before...)If you can, don't walk, but run to your Amazon accoutn and buy this book today. You won't be disappointed!Sabriel is the heir to her father's legacy, the person with the singular task of keeping the Dead sealed in Death. She grows up on the border between a world very much like our own and the Old Kingdom, a place where the rules of nature bend and change to the magic of the Charter. On her quest to find, and restore, her father, she will find love, face evil, and walk the paths of the Dead.Nix keeps the plot moving, and barely a page is wasted. Pick up this book on an empty Saturday, clear your schedule, and sit back for an enjoyable read."
5,Outstanding for Young Adults and Parents Alike,"We bought the audio book version of Sabriel on a whim for an all-day drive with our 11-year old daughter. True luck! The trip was a pleasure as we journeyed into a wonderful world of heroes, magic, and fertile imagination. This is not just another tired fantasy re-telling of dragons and trolls. Indeed, Garth Nix has built a world that resonates with meaning and relevance. All this in a book written for young adults. Immediately upon returning home we purchased the next two books in the trilogy (Lirael and Abhorsen), also on tape. Tim Curry did such a great job with the narration that we sat around the tape player as a family and listened before bedtime. I'm sorry we're now finished.This is a particularly good series for girls aged 10-14. The most important figures are young women of strength and character."
5,These are the best books I've ever read,"My name is Aaron Trawick, I'm 15 and have read more books then my whole homeroom combined. I just got done reading Sabriel and Lireal and these are by far the best books I've ever read. You can disagree all you want, but I've read the Harry Potter books (J.K. Rowlings), the Lord of the Rings books(J.R.R. Tolkien), The Redwall series (Brain Jacques) and many other great books by great authors, but Garth Nix has outdone them all. I tell any sceince fiction lover to read these books.Aaron Trawick ADT"
5,Sabriel,"I though Sabriel was one of the best books i've ever read, it was thrilling and full of suspense. I would definitly recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy or dark subjects. this book is so great."
4,Fantasy Readers Will LOVE!,"Sabriel is a classic coming of age/quest adventure. It's heroine is female which I liked because many of the fantasy type books have a male protagonist. Sabriel is a strong young woman yet vulnerable as well.I enjoyed how Sabriel didn't quite seem to know everything and ""get"" everything but she forged on knowing that even if she didn't get it perfect she still had to try.The storyline is interesting and you get the sense that there are many more stories about the ""old kingdom"" left untold.The author could have gone into the explanations in a little more detail about the necromancy, the ""bells,"" and what each person's role is but at the same time I think it is a tool to have the reader feel a little like Sabriel does: like she knows she needs to keep going on this quest, she knows that she doesn't know everything, but perhaps she knows enough to get her through successfully."
5,How about a movie?,"I would love to see a good movie made based on this book. Am I the only one? The book is great, the best of the Trilogy. It has all it needs to become a major movie, if the right people are involved."
5,My favorite trilogy,"I sat down many years ago and randomly picked up this book. I read through it in one sitting, and it is is truly my favorite. I still wish there would have been more than the three in this trilogy, such as other stories in the same world. Some more stories from the Old Kingdom would be greatly appreciated. This book lures you in and leaves you wanting to know more about this magical world."
5,you won't be able to put it down!!,This was one of my favorote books i have ever read.(and that is sayin somthing cause i am hard to please when it comes to books) It is very well writen. It is so imaginative and the characters seem so real. It's basicly a classic fight against good and evil with a twist and a hint of romance. I highly recomend it you won't be able to put it down!!
5,THIS IS THE BEST BOOK!!!!,"Some people say that you can't judge a book by it's cover, but in this book it is particularly true. The cover makes Sabriel look not as pretty as she is, and the monster look lame. However everybody shuld read this book. It is my favorite. IT is mildly scary, filled w/ mystery, and even has a hint of romance...."
5,so good!,"This book was so great. It had every element you'd want to find in a story. tragedy, comedy, romance, adventure, magic and sarcasim. Sabriel finds out that her father has been trapped in the world of the dead and sets out to find him meeting a ""cat"" with an adittude, a boy her age who just happens to be a prince with a very interesting story and past, and several handfulls of dead things. read the book, it's good, trust me."
4,Sabriel,"This book, the first of the series, is a VERY well written book. Garth Nix carefully weaves magic and reality to gether so cunningly that it's almost a reality into it's self! Garth Nix is a great author and full of tricks and twists its most definately a good read!"
4,This is one of the most interesting books I have ever read,"The incoorporation of magic and other fantasy elements added to realistic issues like loss, love and friendship gives this story an interesting plot. I also like the fact that the main character is a strong-willed young woman battling evil. It is unusual sometimes to read a book where the female (Gabriel) is strong and intelligent. Gabriel uses dangerous magic which she inerrited through her long family line of Necromancers. She was destined to keep the kingdom of the dead, her world and the Old Kingdom appart, following in her father's footsteps."
4,Caveman construction and durability,The other reviewers sound like they are not running the proper hub spacing and chainline. You cannot just throw a freewheel on a Mountain bike. This is a low cost throw away freewheel and it seems to be at least equal to the higher priced Shimano. I run a White too and this freewheel works fine. I've been running them on my two Beach single speeds for years and they still spin free and quiet. A bargain at $10.
5,tasty!,This album is fantastic. Wayne Krantz is one of the most original and most interesting guitarists out there today. He steals the show on this disc. His solo track is a standout. Highly recomended!!
1,Not a happy customer,I recently purchased this DVD and I must say I was greatly disappointed. I really enjoy watching different shows of this genre on TV and so I was looking forward to watching this DVD. Not only was it extremely short (I couldn't believe when it was over) but totally unbelievable. My advice is save your money.
5,Jane doherty Investigates,I loved the DVD! I'm glad someone finally recorded one of Jane's wonderful seances. It was very professionally done with a great narrator. Jane Doherty is quite a gifted medium and psychic. I have been to many of her seances and enjoy them each time I go. The DVD makes you feel like you are actually there. Kudos to Jane! When is the next one coming out?
4,Considered Review,"As always Diane Chamberlain has produced a good read. Kept me turning the pages to the end. The site is asking for more words, I think I've given enough of my time."
4,Excellent,Great character development and a story with lots of twists and turns. Kept my interest right to the last page. Read in one day
3,disappointed,"I will give this review 3 stars because I did finish the book. I had just gone to the Outer Banks, bought this at a book store in Buxton, and hoped for the best. However, I was extremely disappointed at the shallowness of the characters. I am not talking about their actions, but the development and presentation of the characters as written by the author. In fact, the only character I liked and found ""real"" was the daughter Lacey. The two main male characters, Alec and Paul, were shallow, weak, and could be manipulated in any way possible. Where were their backbones and integrity? Olivia was also weak, naive, and unbelievable, at least to me. I truly cannot believe that she would bare her soul to an almost stranger so quickly.Using the real Hatteras Light Station as metaphor was certainly interesting, but that beautiful structure deserves better."
2,My least favorite Chaberlain book,I have read at least 8 Diane Chamberlain books and this was the hardest one for me to read. I could never get into the book. I didn't care for teh characters of the book. My favorite book by Ms. Chamberlain has been The secret life of CeeCee Wilkes.
3,"Lighthouse, see glass, ocean lure",This is a tough one. It's hard to make up my mind about its value. At some points it's really spell binding; at others it's mundane and rather boring. Some chapters allow me to see and enjoy the beautiful stained glass art work and the sea glass beckons all kinds of contemplation and meditation; at other times it's overdone and really quite boring. I like Alec in some chapters and in others see him as a real wimp. Paul is crazy and mixed up and a very real wimp. Mary is a delight as she describes her days and love as lighthouse keeper. Good job Diane Chamberlain but not your best. I'd give it 3 stars .
4,Surprises and Suspense,"This book has so many twists and turns that it keeps you on the end of your seat. I felt compelled to read her second book ""My Mother's Shadow"" which was really good suspense."
3,Disappointing for me,"I have loved every one of Diane Chamberlain's books, but this one just didn't do it for me. I hated the adultery circle and the whole lighthouse/Mary Poor storyline just didn't really fit in. It was too long and I couldn't wait for the last 100 pages to end."
5,I loved this book!,"I was not familiar with this author, but the description sounded interesting. I was not disappointed! The plot twists and development of the characters kept me quickly ""turning"" pages! I ejoyed this book so much, I look forward to reading another book by Diane Chamberlain."
5,great play house,"I just got this for my one year old daughter, she loves it. Being as young as she is I really didn't think she would play in it but she does. She took the hand of my neighbors kid(age 7) and lead him into the house. It's a great item. Sooooo easy to set up, and a carrying bag, it's perfect. soon I'll add the add on parts.love it love it love it................"
5,Love this tent.,"this tent is so durable it stands up to my two year dragging it all over the house, it is very portable and easy to fold up and put away when not using it. Very sturdy tent."
4,Handy book for those with SAS Experience,"I used this book the first few hours that I received it. This is not a stand alone book for those that want to learn SAS functions. I think this text is best suited for people who use SAS regularly and needs a handy reference while programming. Skimming through the book would also provide the reader with an understanding of what functions SAS is capable of doing. However, it is highly likely that you will not use all of the programs, most of the programs are pretty useful especially to those that are required to manipulate data in SAS."
5,"Excellent, my dear Holmes!","So long as you don't allow yourself to be tricked into buying the same book twice (yes, Virginia, Sherlock Holmes: The Missing Years is the same book!!) you are in for a treat. This author captures Holmes as Holmes would have been--still the world's greatest detective. Disguise, aliases, locations, all these meant nothing to the man behind the magnifying glass. The Fu Manchu like attack with the leech in the lamp--brilliant! I can't say enough good things about this book except Jamyang Norbu, don't make it your last! Definately five Sherlock stars! Quoth the Raven..."
1,"Shame on you, Norbu","This terrible book should be anathema to any true reader of the Holmes Canon. SH once said ""no ghosts need apply"" when first confronted with the Baskerville legend but the author fills the book with mystical nonsense -- duels with energy bolts! - levitation! - alternate lives! -Moriarty rising from Reichenbach falls (the shock of iminent death reminded him he was a powerful llama). Very silly stuff -- but in the context of a Holmes pastiche it's sacrilegious.My only regret is that true readers cannot mount a class action suit against this twisted mockery of Holmes' logic-based adventures. Give this book to your enemies."
4,Barbie fun,My daughter is doing an informal cheerleading class and this worked so great for her. She is having so much fun with being a cheerleader. Super cute!
4,An Innovative Work of Art,"The first illustrated romance novel is sure to entertain lovers of medieval and fantasy reading. The writing is a bit more graphic than I usually like, but conveys the realism of medieval war, while the pictures are magical in quality. Ms. Sanders and Mr. Fortin are each a class act and this carefully crafted production is proof. If you enjoyed those wonderful illustrated children's novels of Merlin and other magical characters as I did, this book may fullfill your adult wishes for adventure, with gorgeous visual entertainment as an added bonus.I am looking forward to the next one."
2,Just ok,"If there weren't any cheesy pictures to look at, this might have been a better experience for me. Instead, I had to roll my eyes every time I was interrupted by the funny looks on the models' faces. The heroine is a huge disappointment and I cringed at a lot of her scenes."
4,An Interesting Story,This was a short love story about hero going off to war and heroine worrying about his safety. It was still enjoyable and I would recommend this book.
3,ha hahahaaa haha. for real.,"Please be sure you either enjoy a really bad taste in romance novels or a really balls-out good sense of humor regarding them, because this book is ridiculous bordering full retard. I bought it as a joke for a romance fan... and it worked. I would buy this book for anyone who needs a hearty laugh over some smouldering stares and heaving bodices. LOL!"
3,I can't believe I paid so much for this book!,"Having said that, the artwork is simply fabulous! I could study each one and immerse myself in so much beauty and color.But the story is what put me off this book. It's flat, boring, and totally embarrassing even to this seasoned romance reader who thought she could handle the worst purple prose.But hey, I doubt people buy this book for the story right?"
3,Finished the series,"So, I've been looking for this book forever and finally found it. I've already read the other 2 books in the series and enjoyed them. This book did not appeal to me as much as the other 2, but it was still pretty good."
2,"Cute book, but...","Although good-hearted, the heroine, Jenny, has such incredibly poor judgement that I found it hard to care about or sympathize with her."
1,I really hope people aren't buying this stuff on here..,Let me begin by saying that I work FOR Chanel cosmetics and I cannot believe people are trying to sell these products for such high prices on here. This mascara only costs $30 at the Chanel counter. Don't be fooled by these sellers. I just saw a $23 nail polish priced at $34.
3,Product is great. Price is ridiculous.,"I was torn as to what type of review I should leave behind because I love love LOVE this mascara but I was seriously shocked by the ridiculous price the seller was charging for it. You could find this mascara at ANY Chanel counter for $30. Considering this seller is trying to sell it for $40+shipping, I am starting to wonder how much people are willing to pay to avoid stepping into a store.Either way, if convenience is what you are after, just buy it online on any of the Department Store websites that sell this product. At least that way, you could return it if you find there is a problem with the product without too much of a hassle."
4,"Great product, helpful seller","I've been using Chanel's Inimitable Mascara for years and the quality pretty much speaks for itself - it's Chanel and it's fabulous! The mascara really defines your lashes well and doesn't leave clumpy smudges. Well worth the price. In regards to my Amazon.com transaction - the product arrived in great shape, although it arrived several days after the stated delivery date. I will caveat this by saying it was NOT the seller/sender's fault, rather USPS who lost track of the package. The seller eventually had to put a tracker out on the package, and USPS delivered it the following day. So all in all, the seller did a great job in helping me to locate the package with USPS, but I would recommend in the future sending the shipment tracking information in advance (it was sent to me after I requested it because the delivery date had passed)."
3,Just Okay,"It will lengthen the lashes but not smoothly, too thick. A friend let me try her Diorshow Iconic, yet I purchased this more expensive brand. I think the Iconic was much better, smoother and more natural looking."
5,Church Book Study Discussion Group Enjoys Book,"Our church book study group has read and discussed a large number of books in the last several years and this book provided the material to spark the deepest and most soul searching reading and discussion we have ever experienced. None of us being perfect, we found that all of the areas that the author explored were painful to many of us also. We appreciated that the end of the book gave concise guidelines on how to let go, and that the author was so painfully honest about the areas of her life she needed to let go."
3,SORTA DRUG,"I'm a big Rick Monday fan, but this book didn't have a whole lot to do with him, and I found it to be rather dry reading......."
4,Basically good introduction to mathematical concepts,"In this book Rudy Rucker provides a novel way of classifying mathematical thinking - as number, space, logic, infinity, and information. He uses many standard examples and some more unusual ones such as classifying numbers as small, medium, large and inconceivable. It provides a good introduction for the general reader of mathematics, especially on the mathematical frontier, with such concepts as transfinite numbers, Goedel's incompleteness theorem, and cellular automata theory. It does have some errors, such as calling ""Every sex act is sacred"", ""Every sex act is evil"" imply ""Some evil acts are sacred""; is a valid logical argument; not so. Consider this interpretation: ""Every irrational integer is irrational"", ""Every irrational integer is an integer""; hence ""Some integers are irrational"". But in general I would recommend this book to the general reader."
4,Start your collection now,"Caryn Lin's CD is a blend of soft dream-scapes and energetic rhythms. Her sound is much more organic than synthesizer especially with the good use of percussive elements in tandem with the electric violin. Each song is distinctive which will only draw you in further.Her live shows are quite magical and her latest CD, ""No one to blame"", comes closest to capturing that magic. Start your collection now."
3,creative electric violin and percussion,"Track samples here don't do justice to the disc's entrancing rhythms and intriguing electric violin play. (Only two tracks have vocals.) Some tracks are upbeat, percussive and funky. A couple have hooks that can run in your head for hours. Others are spare, bleak. You might call them ""depressing"" and avoid them or you might call them ""haunting"" or just ""moody.""I prefer Caryn Lin's Honour the Rain to this CD because it's a little warmer and its title track is an incredibly evocative five minutes of percussion, melody, and changing landscapes."
3,"Okay, but limited to certain topics","This book deals extensively with the polythesim of Rome's religions. It is good that this is well covered as it really gives a lot of background to the deities used on Roman coin types. However out of 12 chapters or so in the book at least 8 of them are on Religion and 1 or 2 are on language which seems a bit stuffy to me.The book is easy to read and at ~110 pages gives some detail on the Roman gods. However, the trades, professions, sciences, & etc are completely ignored in this book. I have a better but still not very good understanding of the average Roman after reading this book.Still as a specific work on the 'importance of Roman gods' & why they are featured on coins, it is a valuable reference to the collector of Imperial Roman coins. However it's title makes it appear as a more general work."
4,Echo & the Bunnymen's guitarist takes a wild spin!,"This is a great follow up to Glide's debut release Space Age Freak Out, an essential release in any ambient collector's collecton. Here we have Will Seargant (Echo & the Bunnymen guitarist) dropping the guitar and giving us strange and wonderful ambient electronic music. There are no vocals on this release. If you like early Orb material you'll enjoy this CD."
2,Mixed Feelings,"I have to say, I was unhappy on this one as well, I'm a avid SK fan, but this story was not only rushed, but it wasn't put together right. I agree with the previous reviewer, Cael and Amr should have had their own book, there was more about them in this story than Rav, and Sus. The begining was wrong to start with, her friends dying the way they did wasn't believable. The humans in many of her rushed books are being portrayed as idiots, I can believe them getting together with the daimons, some people may believe they can give everlasting life, but really after they are witness to the destruction and happen to still stick around, then it's just wrong.To cut this review off, I have to say I wasn't happy about this book, but, being a fan, I will read her books, even the crappy ones.~Unhappy~"
4,Loved this book,"I picked this up randomly in a library while shopping for something else. I am an avid reader, and I just couldn't put this book down. Other D-H's fans may be disappointed, but since this is the first of the series I read, it sent me running to read the others.Heros are likable, even if some of them have flaws... as everything else, it's not perfect (as I am sure, not meant to be). Some people will like/love it, others won't.As for me, I just had a great time reading it."
3,Not her best...,"I love the Dark-Hunter series, but I was kind of disappointed in this latest installment. There was little in terms of character development with both the newly introduced and old favorites. Hopefully, this book is only a setup for another of Kenyon's page turners."
2,Refund please!,"There are some faithful names in paranomal romances that you can always trust: Christine Feehan, J.R. Ward, Karen Marie Moning, and Sherrilyn Kenyon. Or at least, I used to trust Sherrilyn Kenyon. I'm beginning the think that there should be a shelf life for this series of hers.After a while it gets kind of tiresome reading about the same ""type"" of hero, meeting the same ""type"" of heroine in the same type of way. Nothing about this story was fresh and new. I yawned through it all ~300 pages of it. If this is your first Dark Hunter novel, STOP! Don't read it, because it may discourage you from reading any of her other books.In my opinion, this was just a tired attempt by Kenyon (a bone while we wait for Ash's story). I encourage you to read some of her earlier Dark Hunter novels first, then debate whether or not you want to ever read this. Truly, it wouldn't matter if you didn't."
4,Refreshing,"I do not agree with everyone else review, but that is my provocative. I really enjoyed the book. It was different, easy to read. The characters were strong, but then I like them that way can't stand a whimpy woman whining....UGH. If you like the author judge this one for yourself."
2,Meh.,"Like the other reviewers, I must say this one wasn't up to par. I guess all vampire romance series go downhill eventually, (Feehan, Hamilton, are your ears burning?) but this series really did have a lot going for it. Susan and Ravyn were nice characters, but they were just a regurgitation of most of her previous couples. The problem is that she's trying to make the plot too complicated, while ignoring the relationship between the main characters. I liked the series best when it was just a few Dark Hunters up against a few Daimons, back when no one knew what Ash was, there weren't 157 kinds of Were Hunters, and Nick was really alive. If I wanted to memorize an encyclopedia of made-up rules, exceptions, and minor characters, I'd read Tolkien. I just wish Kenyon would resolve issues with previous characters before introducing half a dozen new ones."
4,necessarily unnecessary,"It was a filler book and it was unnecessary to the story line. However, it opened up other doorways to readers, brought in new characters that may be used again later and delved slightly deeper into the darkhunter world. It may not have been the typical story we darkhunter fans enjoy but i saw it as a breath of fresh air, yet still the action-packed romance that is classic to sherrilyn kenyon, and evidence to her still thriving talent of writing the novels we all love"
4,Enjoyable read,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, a very pleasant surprised because I have found the last couple of dark hunter books to be very average. I loved the character development, the building of their relationship and the secondary characters. This was a great afternoon reading escape and has actually made me look forward to, rather than dread, the next episode in this imaginative series. Thank you Sherrilyn."
1,Second time even worst.,"I actually bought this book the day it was released but I never did finish it. The first time reading it was horrible. I end up falling asleep with it in the middle of the day. I didn't pick this book up again until two days ago. Since Dream Hunter was just released, which btw is just as bad, I thought maybe I should give this book another try. I told myself, maybe the second time around would be better. It wasn't. Instead, it took me two days to finish. I never take more then a day to finish a good book. This time around I actually forced myself to finish. Ravyn was the most boring hero I've encounter and Susan was just plain annoying. I felt that this book was not meant to really tell a story of Ravyn and Susan, but it's more of an excuse to introduce characters for future stories."
2,Ok.......,"Even though I liked Ravyne and Susan,I wasn't impressed with Nick or Ash's story. Nick is really unreasonally and annoying in his angst against Ash and I am really getting tired of Ash and Artemis relationship. It is thesame old thing and am tired of reading about it. He doesn't seem as strong and invincible as Savitar, whom I enjoy his character. I was expecting to learn more about Ash, but I only learned what we already know: his real appearance. I hate his lack of backbone while dealing with Artemis and I do not enjoy the fact that with all his power, he never appears when he can help. He always knows about what is happening, but he always complain about this bargain or that bargain with Arti. He always says he can't interfere with the natural flow of things, but he always does when he finally does show."
3,As Randy Jackson says...,"""It's just allright for me."" It was ok to burn some time, but I didn't really care about anyone in the book or anything that happened. There was no emotional attachment as in previous releases. I finished it swiftly and my first thought was...""that was kinda lame."" This is the first were-hunter book I could care less about, and I don't think it was worthy of her first hardback release. I'll still buy all her books though..."
2,Too weak for hardback.,"This book wasn't horrible, but boy was I glad I borrowed it from the library. I'd have been very angry had I put out over $20 for it!"
4,I liked it....it's supernatural romance.,"I missed the story being based in New Orleans. New characters and a new santuary will keep you on your toes. Ash and Artie are up to the same 'ol same 'ol. Nick makes an apperence and boy has he gotten nasty, what has he gotten himself into now. There's going to be a lot of new twists and turns in the upcoming novel(s).Ravyn and Susan are the main romace story. I thought Susan was a little too 'smart mouthed'. Ravyn's story was a bit like Wren's in ""Unleash the Night"". Still steamy and I could not put it down for two days."
2,Fight the Impulse,"I have seen this book on endcaps in stores everywhere and have almost purchased it time and time again. Wow. Am I glad I got it at the public library. I have enjoyed this author's titles when writing as Kinley MacGregor yet overall I was disappointed with this book. I understand this is a series, however the story bogs down with all the background details and is unable to support it's own weight. I admire the smarts and guts of the heroine but she doesn't have much to do except comfort a very one-dimensional ""tortured, anti-hero"" type. I managed to finish the book which(yawn) the best I can say is that it cured me of the urge to spend my money on other Dark Hunter Novels."
1,Terrible,"I bought this book because it was 4.99 for the hard back and this series seemed very popular. This is basically a romance novel (and not a very good one) hidden in supposed fantasy fiction. There are so many flaws it's not worth the time to list them, and the writing is flat to say the least. Don't waste your time."
1,Rude & Abrasive--Not A Good Introduction To This Author's Works,"When the heroine is so abrasive reading the book is an obnoxious experience, time to put the book down.This was my first experience with Sherrilyn Kenyon's writing.Since I was having trouble caring about the characters, I skipped ahead--only to find a rude description of the main characters walking in on a couple having sex.The mass media may have become normally rude and crude.That doesn't mean one has to endure rudeness and crudeness in novels bought for reading pleasure."
3,Disappointed,"Like all the other reviewers before me--I waited (not to patiently)for this book to be released & then spent the money & bought it in hardback BECAUSE I LOVE SHERRILYN & THE DARK HUNTERS!! What a waste!!! The characters were weak (Susan--the ""heroine) is annoying. She is certainly not stupid, and a lot could have been done with her character. Ravyn (love the name!!) is your typical tortured DH but WHY IS HE WITH THIS BIMBO?? It makes me wonder about his mental state. As for the characters of Nick & Ash--what is going on?? I realize that Nick is ""upset"" with Ash--but he is still alive--sort of--he needs to get over it. As for Ash & Artemis--whatever!!! She is a cow & Ash should kill her--he has more patience then I do apparently.The last couple books have been very disappointing. I hope Ms. Kenyon reads these reviews & gets ""her groove back"". I hope all this is leading us somewhere. I'll buy the next one--but I'll wait for the paperback."
4,I actually liked it,"I really liked this book for the simple fact that she seems to be pulling together all the other books. Her other books in the series seem to be separate entities about an individual character and that character finding his or her lover for eternity. This one does the same thing, but more of the book is about what has been going on in books past. This book didn't really center on the romance. I liked that she is moving past that and actually creating a flowing series instead of brief mentions of other characters as she has in books past.I gave this book four stars cause I really didn't like the characterization of Nick. I felt that he was a bit out of character. I mean...you would expect him to be a bit bitter, but c'mon....this was overkill."
2,Not worth the wait,"I read Fantasy Lover ""back in the day"" when it was first released. Since then I have eagerly awaited each DH book by Sherrilyn Kenyon and I have my personal favorites....but Dark Side of the Moon is not one of them. Unfortunately I found myself pausing while reading the book to question:1)personal hygiene2)dialog (yep, I agree Susan was unlikable and sarcastic)3)where is the love story??? where is the romance???I didn't care about the main characters, Susan especially didn't gel for me (the reporter/driver extraordinaire/sword expert/black belt)and the pace of the book felt frantic. For die-hard SK fans, most readers will be satisfied, for those readers new to the series, DSM will not do justice to the Dark Hunter World."
2,Disappointment at its finest,"I honestly didn't know a lot about this series until I found it while wandering in my local library one day. Being the vampire obsessed individual that I am, I immediately grabbed it, found the nearest seat, and started reading.What an utter waste of time. Some of the details were so unbelievable (like humanity being completely ignorant of their imminent destruction by the Daimons/Apollites). I also could not stand the heroine, Susan. Mary Sue if I ever saw one. If she was half as sarcastic, half as much of a super-woman, and had a slightly less ""pity me"" background, the book would not have suffered for it.This book did have some interesting qualities to it, however, which made me want to read the rest of the series from the beginning. I fully intend to do that, and I hope that Kenyon's other books aren't nearly as atrocious in their characterizations, cadence, and believability."
4,kenyon is a fun read,Dark side of the Moon is a great addition to all of the other Dark Hunter Novels. I really like Kenyon's style. She has a very different flair that flavors all of her work.
5,"here kitty, kitty, kitty. and what's up with Nick?","Sue and rayven are two of the most differernt hero and heroin of Mrs.Kennon's Dark-Hunter series. the man is a jaguar and the lady is allergic to the cat-form of Rayven. Nick is back as a new dark hunter and Ash is still pissed at him after what happened in last book ""Sieze the Night""."
2,Don't bother or at least wait for the paperback,"This book was such a disappointment. I have waited eagerly for each new Dark Hunter novel, but the last few haven't been that great, and this one was just painful to get through. Right before I got this book I re-read Fantasy Lover, the first book in this series, and it's hard to believe that the books were written by the same author. Dark Side of the Moon has none of the plot and character development that is found in Fantasy Lover. There is absolutely no chemistry between the main characters, and their relationship seemed rather forced. I don't know if the author is trying to write books for too many different series (at least three that I know of), but I really wish her new novels had the same flavor as her earlier ones."
2,Huge fan of this series!!! But this book was a disappointment!!,"I loved this series and read all of the books and companion stories leading up to this book. This book was a huge disappointment!!! I was not happy with the whole reporter-police scandal part of the series. I just wanted to hit fast forward. I couldn't wait to finish it just so I could finally move on to the next book which will hopefully be better and back on track. Problem when reading a series, you need to read all of it so you don't miss something that may be in a future book."
2,irritating wise-guy,"Ravyn and Susan left me cold. Their relationship did not even qualify as a romance. Susan is such a wise-guy throughout the whole book that I cannot find myself rooting for her part. She is too irritating. Next item: what is going on with one of the main characters? I hate when a good guy becomes bad. Of course, the author will keep this hateful character a little while longer to torture both Ash and readers alike. If you are a faithful DH follower, please save your money and borrow this from the library. Try Vane and Bride's story in Night Play. It's a much better Were-Hunter story."
1,Can't recommend,"I love Kenyon's writing and the Dark Hunter series, especially. That's why this book is so disappointing; the story is so convoluted with so many things going on at the same time that I was losing interest trying to keep up.First we have Susan who is sarcastic to the point of real annoyance. Second, Ravyn who has real Alpha possibilities never seems to fully develop. And the romance between them was totally unbelievable, could I believe there was lust between, yeah; but LOVE, not at all. It was 100 pages before each thought the other was ""hot""!This book was a bloop on the Dark Hunter screen. I can't recommend it except to the die hard Dark Hunter fan that needs to be up to date for the next Dark Hunter book coming out."
2,Felt Unfinished,"I have been reading the DH stories just recently and have really enjoyed the others in the series. This book, however, has left me disappointed and confused. I was almost done with the book when I realised I was waiting for the story to get good. The relationship between Ravyn and Susan just had no oomph. It just happened without any real reader participation. I just did not feel connected with the charaters like I have in the other DH books. This book felt rushed and incomplete. As I have just started this series recently and have purchased many of the next ones, I am hoping this book is a fluke and not a peek of what is to come."
2,No Anne Rice here,"I've read Anne Rice, and loved it. I don't love this. This is a combination of romance novel (which I don't enjoy in general) and fantasy/occult which I often like quite a bit. Perhaps it's not fair of me to review this book because I don't as a rule like romances. But I was willing to give it a shot, and I'm sorry. The characters were unbelievable, their ""Rules"" of engagment were just silly (e.g. immortal killer beasts cannot enter a home without an invitation), and there were many inconsistencies (e.g. Ravyn's bullet holes heal in a matter of hours, but he still has blisters on his hands or bruises on his neck long afterwards).I enjoyed the sarcasm of Susan, though."
2,The worst of the Series.....,"I am truly disappointed in Darkside of the Moon by Sherrilyn Kenyon. I went against the reviews and decided to make up my own mind. I am so sad. I have enjoyed all of Kenyon's Dark-hunter books but this one was just terrible. The horrible attitude of Susan just made my head hurt. She was ""overly"" obnoxious even during the intimate moments. I did like the ending and it was a shocker. I am afraid to buy another book but I want to know what happens. I do not want to be disappointed. I know the next one is Devil May Cry and I want it to be good. I am a new Kenyon reader and I am catching up. I hope the next book rekindles my spirit, but the reviews are making me doubt it."
3,Long book,"This book was much longer than her other books, small print. I love any one of her stories that has Ash, Nick and now Savitar in it. As far as the main characters Ravyn and Susan, the story was ok. But they seemed to take a long time to figure things out. I know its because I know everything from the perspective of the reader, but I found myself yelling at the pages, ""It's a trap!"". Not literally, but you get the point. This story did not resolve anything and set up the characters for future stories. I liked that aspect of the book. The steamy relationships were at a minimum, a trend I am finding as I get into the double digits of her books. I think you have to read the entire series to really appreciate her style and the characters in the book. So based on that and the mention of previous characters in this book, I recommend it."
1,Just Bad,"The writing quality alone makes me cringe when reading a Sherrilyn Kenyon book. However, every now and then she produces a gem of a story that helps you forget that she is writing a book a third grader could read. Not the case with this one. The plot is boring and the romance between the main characters is non-existent. Bad writing, bad plot, bad romance - I am done with this series."
4,Sherrilyn Kenyon Books,I enjoyed this book very much. It also paved the way for me to end up buying the whole searies of Dark-Hunter Novels.
1,No Please please get back to real writing,"I totally agree with everyone who said this book was weak, disappointing and too full of secondary characters. The last three books have been horrible. Who is writing these things? Where is The Ash that I fell in love with? He is my absolute favorite character and I just don't get what is going on. Plus there is NO WAY I WILL PAY $20 for another hardback by this Author. What happened to the paperbacks? I love the DH series but with the quality of the last three books they don't deserve the money a good hardback book cost. I will be going to the library or a second hand store for the next book of Sherrilyn Kenyon. You know with the time of 6 months between books you would think she could put together better stories. I am not sure what is going on with her but I really hope she reads all the reviews, takes note and gives us back the DH series we all started out with and love."
1,"wow, not good","The other books in the Dark Hunter series are fantastic. The stories are very unusual - creative and they draw you in. The characters are well developed. Ash is one of the most interesting characters throughout the entire series.How did this book happen? There is no empathy for any of the characters, and Ash is ruined. Perhaps there is a ghost writer? It is confusing how a really good author like this could write this. The characters are totally annoying, and the dialog between them is astonishingly uninteresting.The first few books were so excellent. Lets just hope the next one gets back into the fantastic quality of the first few."
2,Just Not Up To Par,"Like many of the other people that already wrote a review for this book, I too feel that this book just didn't measure up to the others. I stopped several times and said to myself, ""Come ON ALREADY!!"" One of my problems is the fact that there wasn't any tension really between Ravyn and Sue (It all happened VERY easily for them) BUT my biggest problem was the whole,"" Who is the one in the police department that is helping them."" Okay, didn't Leo give Sue a folder that said it was the police chief. Well good grief, why did it take seeing a picture of them at the party when she was going through Jimmy's computer much later. I already knew it was the police chief and they should have too!!!"
3,Let Down,"One of Sherrilyn Kenyon's real talents is her ability to draw you into the worlds she creates. Brilliant Character development and great plots are a Kenyon hallmark. Characters you love to love and feel with, burst from each page taking you along on their adventures.The Dark Side of the Moon was not up to her usual standard. Character consistency with the previous books seemed off. Many of the charcters new and old were ho-hum or just hateful people. Hard to identify with or have empathy for. Even Ash seemed too vanilla.All books can't be 5 star books, even though Ms Kenyon has many many 5 star books. I gave this one a 3 but it is still better than most others out there. I would buy it again, just to know what's going on in the the DH world and I eagerly await the next installment."
4,I liked this book!,"While this wasn't the greatest Dark Hunter book, I still enjoyed it. Granted, the female characters are becoming alike, but after so many books, how different can they be? The male leads are also becoming the same. Same dark character, same dialog, and she admits to this in this book that all Dark Hunters are Dark Hunters for the same reason, something awful happens to them and they seek revenge. I mean really, how often can you make this same plot interesting? But, all in all, I enjoyed this book, I liked Susan and I liked Ravyn. I thought it actually steared away from her typical books, more plot, less sex. It had a enticing set up at the end for Nicks story. All in all, I would recommend it."
2,Well Darn,"This book is a disappointment. As with her last, it started okay and then went downhill all the way. A little sarcasm is okay, a lot is very annoying. Susan was defintely annoying. Rayvn deserved a better book and mate. I think Ms. Kenyon has written herself out. Perhaps a vacation would be a good idea. I am so afraid what will happen when she gets around to Ash's book. This expensive hardback book will probably be for sale on ebay soon."
5,Kept me up way too late.,"I have read the Dark-Hunter novels out of order because I couldn't get my hands on them in the correct reading order. This one should definitely not be the first one you pick up. It would be very confusing for a novice to the world of the Dark-Hunters. However, I found it to be the most exciting, action-packed, dramatic episode so far. I picked it up to read the first few chapters just before bedtime, but I couldn't put it down and ended up staying awake until 3:30 am to finish it. I just loved the scene in the board room with Nick trying to ""remind"" the other Squires what happened in New Orleans with the Spathi Daimons and the night he died and he hearing about hurricane Katrina for the first time. There was this feeling in my stomach that was a strange combination of thrill and dread. Ms. Kenyon also reveals a few more details about Ash, introduces us to some new Dark Hunters and Squires, and shows another side of the enemy Apollites."
3,Dissappointing for the Dark Hunter Series,Another disappointment for me. Leading women are starting to annoy me. Also seems like the novels are loosing that edge. Addicted to the series so will keep reading but hope the next novel is not a disappointment.
3,another author in hard cover,"And here we are again folks. Another good author writes a story and that story goes to hard back and the story is mediocere. WHAT IS THE DEAL. Publishers offer hard backs and more money and the once good author writes worthless story. Sorry, no more for me."
3,Dark Side of the Moon,I really liked the begining series of the Dark Hunters but I find every book gets a little more confusing. I don't like so many secrets that are not explained leaving you confused and sad that there is so much hate. I don't think I will be reading any more of Dark Hunter books.
1,Boring read.,"One of the worst written books I've read in a long time. The writing style is stilted and predictable. It's as if the editor decided to lower the reading comprehension scores on this book by decreasing sentence length. I enjoy this type of story, but was very disappointed in this book. Will NOT buy books by this author again."
2,can we say loose ends,In all of the books I have read of hers I have never been left this frustrated with an ending. I kept turning the blank pages at the end of the book thinking there had to be a mistake. So I went to the authors web page thinking the next book out would solve the Ravyn and Susan ending and what about Nick and Cael?
2,"The ""weakest link"" in the series","I love the Dark Hunters and have enjoyed learning about the world that SK has created. There have been some good books and some outstanding books in the series, but this one has been my least favorite. First of all, it was not written well and seemed to be thrown together. There were certain things that were repetitive. The characters were not well developed, and like another reviewer said, Susan was just way too sarcastic. I did not feel any empathy for her at all. I like the sexy scenes as much as other fans, but the scenes in this book were bordering on the ridiculous. It's pretty telling, when some of my favorite characters in the book were the bad guys! Please write a better one next time, Sherrilyn. I'm still a big fan and will forgive you this one."
3,starting to bug me,"This series is starting to get on my nerves. The heroes are hunky, but I am really tired of Ash in a never ending funk. Could we get a little happiness for him with a wrap up story, and start a new line of thought!"
3,Dark-Hunter plus Were-Hunter?,"I'm hooked on the Dark-Hunter Novels. I'm really hooked on the were-hunters since ""Night Play"". ""Dark Side of the Moon"" tried to merge both. I got the magick and sizzle of both. Dark Side held my interest. I finished the book in one day and ready to reread for the details. OK, ""Night Play"" and ""Seize the Night"" are the 5 stars. But ""Dark Side of the Moon"" is well worth reading. Ravyn and Susan sizzle under the pressures of clearing themselves of murder charges and outwitting the vengeful alliance of humans and demons targetting them."
4,Lots of action and the plot moved along well.,"Really liked this story and the interplay with the characters. I have to say it was one of her better plots and not as predictible as some of her other books. The sex did not seemed forced,not as much as some of her other books, but it was still good. Realy set up some of the other books to come with some good plot twists. Nicely done."
2,1 and a half stars,"Like other reviewers have said, Susan was quite sarcastic. Usually I don't mind sarcasm. But Susan was sarcastic to the point of being nasty.On top of that, I don't know what it was, but this book just lacked interest. It lacked depth and emotion. It was just boring and not like her usual stories. I'm finding that I'm not too fond of her earlier books. But I will continue reading them because they're not awful."
3,family problems & stolen goods,"Paul Temple is returning home. on the plan he conversates with a man telling him about a problem he's got. the daughter of a rich man has taken an interest to a man not of her father's liking. back home Paul has to face an organization specializing in stolen goods. D has his flaws, but he's okay, if you can tolerate it. his plots are very strange to me, but i can take it. easy read."
3,"Not bad, but runs small",I have a number of Columia hiking boots and shoes and have found them to be great active shoes. These are a little disappointing. Firstly they run small and not true to size. I wear a 12 and had to go to a 13 since they don't offer 12.5. So order a 1/2 size larger. I even compared it with other Columbia shoes I own and I found the shoe to be smaller than others of the same size.The quality of this low rise shoe is a departure from the same mid height model: it uses simple lace eye holes rather than metal hooks and syling that is less sporty than the comparable mid height model hiking boot. Also the tongue closure is unusually wide when laced; I think this may be because this shoe was designed for the heavy duty metal lace hooks that come on the mid height but instead it got simple lace holes without the hooks so it doesn't close as well.So it is a not quite as recommendable as other Columbia shoes I've owned.
5,Oh My,"Of the thousands of albums I own, only a handful, perhaps twenty, are so seemlessly flawless as this work - every track a gem. Such simple, driving passion disguised in leveled harmonies and touching lyrics all remind me -- great music still exists, if you look. A Different Drum Records: another EXCELLENT call, guys. Keep Pristina's art coming. We're here and listening - gladly. If you are unable to locate this special edition - check for the standard release...WONDERFUL stuff."
3,Handy book,"I purchased this book to back me up in my clinical year instead of carrying the big and great Tintinalli's ""Emergency Med."" I think this little version does a good job in giving a concise information on emergency medicine."
3,Very romantic and seductive book,"It was great to see both sides (even though the reader doesn't really know completely what Rodrigo is thinking until the end).It was a really fun book and there really was only one steamy area of a couple of pages - so if you're not into that but like the plot skimming wouldn't kill the story. The medical terminology was a bit distracting for me - but again, I just skimmed - but it wasn't the essence of the story.I did enjoy the story as a whole but it's not something I'll keep on my shelf to reread or lend."
3,Genie in a Doctor's suit?,"Olivia again did her best to provide readers with the Hero's perspective throughout the book and I am definitely grateful for that!The nature of the story; that we have a heroine who suffers from amnesia is of course, a challenge in terms of what the correct perspective and interpretation is. Due to this amnesia challenge, and maybe the lengthy description of the environment, I think the book suffered a bit from it. There's also the issue of He seems to be perfect and magnanimous to the extent of imbalance between the two characters; I am at times wondering what she has to offer him.The micro forceps was..... creative and definitely unusual."
5,excellent resource,I loved this book. It works on so many levels to explain and inspire working with chakras. Would recommend it to anyone interested in energy medicine.
5,The Book of Chakras: Discover the Hidden Forces Within You,"it is a wonderful resource book on the chakras, for the size it is jam packed with so much info it does go beyond the beginner level enuf tho that even any level can understand & learn MUCH. if ur looking for a basics & some more this IS the book for u. LOVE IT."
2,"Great players, but...","Whatever the technical virtuosity of the musicians, the compositions they play are just not very interesting. Really a disappointment, because from what I'd heard of Gary Willis, I was excited to get this album."
1,DISAPPOINTMENT,"If you're looking for something starring Marilyn Chambers, this ain't it. She only introduces the segments."
2,Britpop in the entirely negative sense of the word.,"An album that is almost astonishing in its cynical targetting of the poor innocent Loaded readers of this world. Of the forty songs featured, just one features a woman (Cerys from Catatonia, an honorary lad). With contributions from Travis, Toploader, Oasis and Ocean Colour Scene, it epitomises all that is wrong with the British music scene. Dadrock, Britpop, whatever - it's good-time music for people without 2 brain cells to rub together. God help us."
1,Wrong product title,"This is the wrong product title for this model number. This model number fits the left REAR, not the left driver side. I verified this on Dorman's website and on Autozone. The model number you need for the left driver side is 742-349."
2,Domestic brands are better.,"Don't be fooled. While this may be an internationally known high quality toilet paper, it pales in comparison to the top of the line products from US domestic brands such as Cottonelle and Charmin.There are two problems I had with this product: the paper itself is too rough (in comparison to domestic, cheaper high quality brands) and the 'perfume' is not a very pleasant smell. You are much better off with Cottonelle 2-ply with Aloe or the Charmin equivalent.Did I mention that domestic brands are also far cheaper?In foreign countries, such as India, where toilet paper is more of a novelty than a necessity, Renova would be a god-send and thus deserving of its title as a luxurious toilet tissue. Otherwise, if you are in the US, it is but for the novelty factor that you should buy this.On a positive note, the Renova Green is a wonderful color and very eyecatching."
4,an Estonian decadent writer,Stenbock was an obscure literary figure of the 1890s who was rescued from oblivion by Adlard. Some of his writings have been reprinted as a result. He was a fascinating figure and Adlard did a fine job.
3,Good movie,I thought this was an excellent movie. Held my attention well. I would recommend it for anyone interested in this period of history of our country.
4,Not bad.,"First some of the drawbacks:First, the l11 is kind of awkwardly designed so it never quite feels right in your hand, it's too rigid and rectangular. Also, you can't set it up (on a table or something) vertically as easily as stouter cameras.Second, the ISO is really high, but they don't really explain what that does. The sales guy told me that you never really need over 200 or so, and when you get above that you get worse pictures.Finally, there is such a glut of Coolpix cameras that you can never really tell if you're getting something of quality. The expertise required to rationally decide on one model over another is beyond me, and I'm sure a lot of others as well.But on the plus side, it takes very large high resolution photographs and has a video mode with audio. The best thing though would have to be the price, which makes it's shortcomings bearable."
2,disappointment,"Worked fine for a while less than a year later, it doesn't focus well anymore.I'm looking for a new one."
3,Chews batteries like crazy,"I bought a brand new pack of four batteries, and I think I was able to take 10 pictures total between the four batteries. The picture quality is good but it takes for ever to load between pictures."
2,"A, while it lasted","Nice prize and quality.The pictures it took we're excellent, and the videos too.Why I rate it so low? Before the second year with it, the screen stopped functioning one day. No known reason."
1,VERY Disappointing!,"I purchased the L11 just prior to a family vacation so I could get some nice snapshots. I was very disappointed. The vast majority of the pics we have taken have been blurry, under or overexposed, grainy or have had some other problem. The two biggest problems with this camera is the delay when you press the shutter button (to take a pic) and the poor focus control. Although this camera was relatively inexpensive, it didn't perform even at the minimum standards I would expect. I would NOT recommend getting this camera. After all, what's the point of getting a ""bargain"" if it doesn't do what it's designed to do?!"
4,cute little camera,"cute little camera! i got it as a gift for a friend and she flipped. it came within the time quoted. so far, so good!!!"
5,"great camera, great price","We really wanted to spend under $100, but had certain options we were unwilling to compromise on. We really feel the Coolpix L11 had everything we wanted."
3,Don't buy if you need good audio,"I thought when I bought this that at last I would be able to record with sound. Unfortunately, there is a significant and off-putting mechanical clicking sound going on in the background like crickets going singing in the background.In fact, if you listen closely to the camera in still mode, you can hear the sound.This happens both in video mode and in audio record-only mode.There is no video-only mode, so you have to use conversion software to delete the audio.So if you just need a camera that takes stills, well, it works fine, has an easy to learn interface, and is parsimonious with batteries. For video + audio? Well, you get what you pay for. It works, but leaves something to be desired."
3,Good Value for Money,"It is a good camera for the money I spent on it. Simple, easy to use, small size."
5,Great camera,I think the size is very light and small enough for great pictures. I like the features and pictures look great!
4,A gift for my parents,"I took a couple of pics with camera before sending this off to Nepal for my parents and it's a good camera. No complaints, none whatsoever.Price per unit value is awesome!"
4,A good camera,I bought this camera for my niece and I have not regretted the purchase.I would recommend for anyone who want a camera for amateur use.I purchased a 2GB card for it at the same time.It would be a good idea to buy a rechargeable battery set because you would be using a lot of batteries once you get started.Nigel
3,"Cheap camera, you get what you paid for","I've had this camera for about 6 months now, and I am about to abandon it for a Canon Rebel XT. The Nikon Coolpix L11 is a nice camera and it takes decent pictures, but it has terrible loading and booting up issues. When you take a picture with the flash it takes nearly 4-7 seconds for you to take another. I would not recommend this camera if you are into action shots."
3,"fuzzy picture, low price",I just bought this camera and was disappointed. My other nikon had 3.2 megapixels and it took better pictures than this one. I'm not sure what's wrong with it but it takes fuzzy pictures for some reason. The price is right but the quality isn't. I'm going to return it and pay a little bit more for a better quality nikon.
1,Lens Jams and Nikon will not repair under warranty,I bought this camera for my daughter for Christmas and paid $100. I was tempted by the low price but should've known it was too good to be true. I've never owned a Nikon before and don't intend on owning one again. After about 6 weeks the lens became stuck while extended. After researching the problem on-line I found many other users had the same problem. The part that realy sucks is that Nikon do not regard this as a camera failure and will not repair it under warranty despite the fact that the camera was only a few weeks old. They would however repair the camera for $165. Duh! I bought a Sony Cybershot years ago and have never had a single problem. I guess my daughter will be getting a Sony now.
2,"Okay Picture, Horrible Video Recording","When I first got this camera, I was excited. A few months after I got it, I started to feel as if this camera was not worth the money. Why? Well, I wanted a cheap camera for video recording and some photo shooting. The pictures it take are fine, but the video... When I upload them to YouTube, they come out as 240p... And the sound? What, is there like a mini-fan near the microphone in the camera? All I can hear is a bunch of weird blowing noises... Here's an example video: [...]"
1,Takes Blurry Pictures!,The camera is fine except for the fact that it takes blurry pictures when up close!!! What is the point of a camera that takes blurry pictures! I would not buy this camera.
2,"lousy pictures, beware","I just got rid of my fujifilm E-510 in hopes that this nikon L-11 would take better macro close ups. Man was i wrong. my fuji was only 5.0 megapixels compared to the nikons 6.0, but the pictures were a lot more clear and crisp. Taking the same close ups i used my fuji for the pictures from the nikon were blurry and no matter how i tried to adjust settings on this camera the pictures were blurry and the auto focus function was very slow. This camera is in my opinion a piece of JUNK!! now i have to throw this thing away and buy a good camera. I hope this helps."
1,Broke twice in one year = Lemon,"I received a Nikon L11 for Christmas 2007.Woo! I was psyched!Within a month the camera developed a problem: It would no longer take pictures, allow me to delete pictures, or power-down when the on/off button was tapped.Grrr....The camera sat in my desk.Finally, around November, I contacted Nikon and sent the camera in for repair. They returned it to me in a couple of weeks and the few test pictures I took indicated that it was again working.Today, after taking six pictures on the repaired camera, it again froze after taking two pictures.I've contacted Nikon for advice as what to do with this now out-of-warranty camera.If you need a paperweight, this is the camera for you."
2,"Poor image quality, slow","I wish I'd done more research before buying this camera; I would advise anyone to buy a different camera. The picture quality is extremely disappointing, even on highest settings--and I'm comparing to the 2MP Kodak EasyShare that it replaced.Aside from the ease of taking quick videos with this camera -- which any of its competitors will do just as easily -- we never use this camera anymore. Between the lack of image quality, even in well-lit surroundings, and the rather incredible amount of time it takes to be ready to take the next picture (not even using flash), the camera is just not as good as many of its competitors in the same price range, and nowhere near other cameras that are even slightly more expensive.On the upside, I like the color of the camera itself; you don't see many brown personal electronics."
2,Spend a little more on a Canon,"Bought this for around $80 on amazon, new. It is just that, an $80 camera. Has a hard time focusing and blurs a lot. I get an error message saying picture is blurry even when it is not. Small, compact, yes. Worth $80, maybe. Frustrating..."
1,Lasted One Day,I suspect this in not typical but the camera I ordered worked fine on day one but on day two it would no longer turn on. I replaced it with a different model of Nikon camera - only because this model was no longer available.
3,It was ok,"The quality of a majority of my pictures were bad. The camera had a hard time focusing and resulted in low quality images.The video part of the camera was good, but the pictures weren't."
4,EXCELLENT BUY for Pix & Price,"I bought this Coolpix L11 last year three days before going to Florida to visit grandparents and Disney World. Without reading the instructions, I took great pictures of the family and unforgettable videos of the kids we will cherish. I love that this uses AA batteries instead of CR2s (grocery stores don't always have them) or ""rechargeables"" (where you have to wait hours to recharge--why bother?). I used a SD card so I can pop it into my computer or printer to view/print--330+ pix and about 10 videos so far. The quality of the pix is VERY GOOD, but alas it does take a second or two between shots. If you need something faster, pay a few hundreds more. My 5 and 2 year-olds use this to take nice pix and because of this, there is jelly or similar on the ""outside"" lens/shutter so it doesn't always open/close fully anymore (I use my thumbnail to do this sometimes). Otherwise, I love it and will probably buy the next version(s) with similar features."
4,Nice camera....Best for its price,This camera is the best for its price....it works well most of the time but goes a little shaky in the dark or low light.
5,Stimulating Insight,"What a treat to have this documentation of the great maestro at work. Kleiber's mastery and subtle coaxing of the musicians under his direction is nothing short of a conducting marvel to be cherished, admired and studied by students and laymen alike for years to come. Indeed, we are fortunate to have this artistic and historical record preserved for our future reference and enjoyment."
2,Vissi D' Refund,"Honestly, sorry I bought this. Jonas Kaufmann is seriously magnificent and if that's all you need from an opera named 'Tosca' then charge away with my blessing. Emily Magee has a great voice and is a fine actress but the things she's called upon to do by the director, as in...lay on the floor, strip down to her slip, etc. only make her look uncomfortable and aren't flattering to a woman with the extra weight she's carrying. She's especially poorly dressed in Act II and that's inexcusable as far as I'm concerned. Thomas Hampson is nobody's idea of a Scarpia but, at 12 feet tall he's certainly menacing enough amongst a cast that is hard to reach 5'8"" in heels ( I never realized how short Kaufmann was 'till now ). As much as I love Robert Carsen's fresh take on so many opera's this one falls completely flat except at the finale of Act I. So, if you can't live without Jonas Kaufmann's latest triumph it's all yours. If you're looking for a real Tosca....this ain't it."
4,"Tosca opernhaus Zurich - Magee, Kaufmann, Hampson","This Tosca is most memorable for Jonas Kaufmann's portrayal of Cavaradossi, which newly defines the role. Kaufmann's ""Recondita armonia"" is most compelling in its intensity and passion, and later his ""E Lucevan le stelle"" is the most touching rendition I've ever heard. The wondrously soft contemplative start that peaks to full glorious voice as he remembers Tosca's embrace captures Mario as no other tenor I've heard including Domingo. For me this production of Tosca belongs to Kaufmann altho Emily Magee sings a fine Tosca with a memorable Vissi d'arte and Thomas Hampson delivers a more than adequate Scarpia."
5,stamina bench,This is a very good bench. It's very strong and well built. When lifting weights you need a good bench that can support your weight as well as thepole and plates. This is the bench trust me.700 pound weight limit more than enough strength.Stamina Strength Performance Series Flat Bench
5,LINEAR KEYFOB,ENTIRE PURCHASE EXPERIENCE WAS GREAT. RECIEVED FOLLOWUP WHEN PRODUCT WAS SHIPPED OUT AND RECIEVED IN TIMELY MANNER
1,Cut and Pasted Hearsay and Generalizations,I will keep it brief for you guys and say I've been a longtime supporter and this here my friends is not worth 2 nickels.
1,crap,its really bad saying tabloid stuff about Janet that isnt true I wish I never bought this DVD. Because of the trash that is on ie.
5,Excellent Preserve,"All of my local supermarkets stopped carrying Smuckers Cherry Preserves, and this is my family's favorite flavor. I was SO relieved when I found it on Amazon. The taste is great, and there are lots of red, plump cherries in this. I ordered 5 jars for my stash, even if the sh1pping is costly. Well worth it.As usual, I've never had a bad batch of Smuckers. It looks great, tastes great, and it is an affordable pr1ce. Well worth the cost!"
4,"Made a very nice gift, but plan to buy memory, too.","Between the price and what you get, this made a very nice gift for my boyfriend. The downsides: It's not the most user-friendly camera; you'll probably need to sit down with the manual before shooting much. It also only comes with internal memory, so you get about seven shots out of the box. You'll have to buy memory to get any more."
4,Wonderful camera,"I bought this camera like 5-6 years ago. The only problem I had was for about 6 months the camera screen did not want to work and it would shut off even with new batteries in it. I decided I was going to put new batteries in it a couple days ago and it started working again. I was so happy. This camera has been through everything, I have dropped it several times, my kids have dropped it and everything. Nothing has broken on my camera even with all this abuse. I would recommend this camera to someone who has kids who want to capture their kids playing or anything else. With a 2GB SD card on TV setting (which takes pretty good pictures for being the lowest quality) I get over 10000 pictures. Definitely a camera to take to any vacation to capture your fun moments. I would just suggest taking better care of it."
2,Poor Poor Quality,"I am returning this camera. The picture quality is poor. Left side of the pictures are always dark. Initially I thought that the issue was with the amera screen. However, moving the pictures to computer did not help. The darkness was stil there. It is quite possible that I have a defecteed unit. But after reading the reviews and my own experience, I have decided to look into other cameras."
5,Nikon Coolpix L10 5MP Digital Camera,"My wife and I purchased this camera for our Grandson's 10th Birthday. This is his first camera and we are teaching him how to take pictures, edit them, store them, and how to respect, protect, and how to be responsible."
3,poor quality,"Although the camera is small and light. Easy to use. But it has a poor quality finish to it. The battery cover looks as though it is made of low grade plastic. Picture quality is OK, nothing great, but what else do you expect from a camera $100 or so.In all not happy with the purchase"
2,Sucks.,"Poor image quality regardless of price, especially indoors. Sent it back. Even the samsungs have better image quality. For a good budget cam, go for a samsung, kodak, or low end canon."
4,"Nice pictures point and shot, no trouble","I have no trouble with it. Nice and sharp Pictures, fast. Be carefull at night when the light recharge, the recharge time is 4-5 seconds long."
4,A great camera,"This camera is compact, light, and it fits in my pocket. I use it for work and personal pleasure. I like the fact that it uses AA batteries. For the price, I could give it a 5 star but the battery life seems a bit short. I could only get around 70 shots with 2x Energizer 2500mAh batteries. I also think it takes a bit too long to start (about 4 or 5 seconds). The LCD is sharp and clear. It's a very good camera at this price range."
3,In His Service and Lovin It,"This is a good study Bible but I found the print rather small and the weight of the Bible rather heavy to carry. Would be good if you plan to just use it at your study desk, but not the best for carrying to church."
5,Nelson Bible Study,"Upon receipt of this Bible, I found the print very easy to read and the notes are very comprehensive which makes it easy to understand what I'm reading. In comparing with other study Bibles I have, this is about the best on the market!I recommend this very highly."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOKA,"I'm am so dosappointed with this book it gives you ingredients that can kill your dog, garlic is lethal to dogs look it up anywhere or ask any vet and they will tell u I used a recipe from this book and came out with a huge vet bill they are lucky I'm not suing! DO NOY BUY THIS BOOK it's garbarge"
3,Unique- with drawbacks.,I bought this book based on all the good reviews and was a little disappointed....almost every recipe calls for a food processor and not having one at the moment pretty much excluded alot of the recipes. Of the ones I did make my two pugs weren't crazy about them. It is O.K. but there are many more that are better out there...
4,good easy to read and use book,"enjoyed this book. Good info,easy to read and use. Has a lovely selection and variety of recipes.Thoroughly recommend it."
2,Obscure ingredients and not too many recipes,I was really hoping for more recipes than this book offered. I wanted a book that offered nothing but recipes and this book didn't do that for me. I have yet to make one single recipe from it because the recipes all have ingredients that I don't have just lying around the house which is what I hoped it would have. Guess I should have reviewed this book more before just buying it.
3,you Bake'em isn't simple recipes,there are alot of biscuits recipes in this book but are so complex or with different flours and stuff...I wasn't that crazy about it but does have a couple that are OK and maybe I can adapt them for my own dog.doesn't any one have some simple biscuits that I can make? Really not what I wanted.
2,Not Up To Expectations,I was very disappointed in this film. The acting is way below average and the lack of much of a soundtrack...pretty much sealed this one for me. I watched the entire movie because every now and then something happens to give you hope.That said......don't waste your time .
1,Not very good,After reviewing the World at War Series I found that World War II Volumes 1-5 pale in comparison. The series tends to be a remake of old war propaganda news reels. The historical value tends more towards film making in the 1940's than to history during the second world war.The facts are shrouded in bias and there is no view point from the other side (i.e the axis powers). I was greatly dissapointed with this series and will sell these disks as soon as a buyer becomes available.
1,Great Documentary Value but ...............,"The people who have produced these DVD's have done an extremely BAD job. Some of the documentaries are cut before their end, the advertised reels in the extras are less than a minute long and the scene index cannot be described. Just awful.Stalin is presented as a good president fighting for the Democratic Values against the BAD Hitler. Weren't they both made of the same material?"
1,Not Worth Your Time,"Simply put, don't waste your money or your time on this book. It is poorly written and provides little guidance to the person wanting to begin their investigation of Plato."
5,"AT LONG LAST, THE BEST 1812!!! BUY IT AND BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR SPEAKERS!!!","At long last, one of the best 1812 Overture recordings has been re-released in a format that does it FULL justice. The performance is better that ANY other one on SACD (sorry, Telarc) and even adds the Boston Symphony Hall pipe organ to the proceedings along with the choir and the giddy brilliance of Colin Davis' conducting!Be careful with your volume and speaker settings (full-range in the rear channels?) as the Pentatone engineers have hit the ball out of the park.This disc ROCKS!!! The sonics are amazing and the performance is excellent!BUY, IMMEDIATELY!!!"
5,Buy right now but be ready to crank it up,"This is my favorite recording of 1812 so far. I own Telarc's version (Cincinnati Symphony) in both DVD-A and SACD and while the cannons sound wimpy compared to Telarc's use of real cannons and the chorus is not as good either, the Boston performance is unrivaled. To really appreciate the performance, you really need to crank your volume up high, this recording makes use of extremely wide dynamic range. Other than 1812, I like better the other pieces selected in the Telarc album compared to this one."
4,Nice product,"This seems to be a very nice product, but it has become apparent that my cat does not care that much for beef; it's just her bias."
3,Meh,"This tripod is just ok. I would only recommend using it for small dSLRS and compacts. The quick release plate doesn't really lie flat, and the whole thing feels plasticky and weak to me."
2,A let down,"This book does have some good information for true beginners, but if you know even a teeny tiny bit about horses, you probably are too advanced for this book. The book also has an odd habit of introducing more advanced topics all of a sudden, with no explanation about them. If you want to learn more about any of these important topics, the author reccommends you ask someone who knows more than you do, or read another book! She does this frequently throughout the book, and I feel that some of these topics are truly the most important things to know about horsekeeping! Some of the info is dated, and it is poorly organized, and she presents many controversial topics, but neglects to say that there are more than one school of thought about it and just gives you one opinion as gospel. I was quite dissapointed with the book overall."
4,Getting Your First Horse,"This is an excellent guide for the family of the passionate teenager who longs for his/her first horse. No one reading this could fail to grasp the difference between volunteering to muck out a few stables atyour local riding school, and being responsible for the welbeing a large animal 24 hours a day."
2,getting your first horse,"Not a very good book for a beginner. Very poor on horse breeds or lack there of, didn't explain the types of horses or their temperment."
3,Good book for beginners,"This is a good book for beginners. But if you have any horse sense at all. I think you probably already know what this book is going to tell you.Still not disappointed that I bought it. Has great breed pictures,some good history,and yes some good tips also."
4,Good beginners info,"I've always loved horses and have wanted to own one. I'm getting serios about purchasing and this book was a great start. It brings up things to think about what you will expect, as far as cost and experiences when looking to buy a horse. If you want more detailed information and are a horse owning beginner, I would also recommend Horses for Dummies, has a lot more detailed information on more topics as well."
1,Phony Phoenix,"The Phoenix mission to mars made some very exciting discoveries, not the least of which was the fact that when it landed its rocket engines blew away the thin soil cover to reveal water ice underneath the spacecraft. It took pictures of the bleak but evocative landscape and found all the chemicals needed for life.So what's wrong with this DVD????It shows NONE of this!The whole DVD is about how they built the Phoenix and how they shipped it to the Cape for takeoff. The damn thing ends with Phoenix on its way to Mars and shows nothing of its actual mission on the Red Planet. What a waste of my time and money."
5,"Charlotte ""Charlie"" Fox walks the walk","OK, I confess, the cover art had me from the get-go. Instead of some variation on the standard ""damsel in distress"", First Drop's says ""go ahead, make my day..."". Fed up with fem jep? Had enough of women in thrillers as victims/targets/cardboard cutouts? Check out First Drop.Because the best news is that Zoe Sharp has crafted not only a compelling female action sleuth, which is something unusual right there, but given her a twisting, turning lightning fast plot in which to shine. This is a classic, high octane thriller that I could not put down until the last page. You'll be hearing more about the Fox in this henhouse!"
1,PITIFUL SIZE!!!,i DID NOT EXPECT IT TO BE SOOOOOO TINY FOR THE $$$!! I'M EMBARRASSED TO GIVE IT TO MY GRANDCHILD FOR A PRESENT!!
5,one of my most cherished books,"I read Beautiful Joe when I was probably about 10 years ago, and it still is one of my most cherished books. I have 2 very old copies of Beautiful Joe and of Beautiful Joe's Paradise, and can only hope that children all over the world would get a chance to read the books. The equal treatment to animals and people should a universal lesson, and I know that my children whole heartedly agree with me, as they have read these books and hold them dear to their hearts also."
2,Ted's way out of tune,"Listen, I love Ted Poley's voice (I'm a huge D2 fan), but I can't recommend this CD. Ted is WAY out of tune on many of the songs here. They sound like they have the potential to be cool tunes, then Ted just loses his way. Played this for a friend, and we were both just cringing at times. I don't know if a stronger producer and a bigger budget would've helped-probably. If you're expecting to hear the Ted Poley voice from the first 2 Danger Danger albums, you're going to be disappointed."
4,Can You?,Can you create players?? If so do u have many choices to choose stuff for ur players?? If you see this and have played the game please contact me!!!!
4,Great Game But Not Durable,"I've never had any problems with my GameCube before and I experienced my first problem with this game. Why 4 stars? That is the reason. I would have rated it five but it broke. But the games graphics are amazing. I had a whole team of created players so the game was awesome. If you are looking for a game, this is the baseball game to buy. I think mine just broke becasue somebody tampered with it, but whatever. Remeber, great game!!"
1,Major Problems With The Game,Lefty hitters expirence a power outage.The ball only goes maybe 75% as far compared to RHB'sand Jose Gullien's arm stregth is a 70. HE HAS A CANNON FOR A ARM. What's up with that ?And the dynasty Mode is seriously messed up cause minor league players never turn out to be any better than avg players.
4,Best baseball game I have played!!!,"I just bought this game and decided to play a game to look at the features. I explored the game and only played one game, but I have made up my mind. This is by far the best baseball game that I have ever played! The graphics are great and most of the players look, for the most part, like the real players. It's easy to figure out how to play the game. I'll admit, it took me 8 innings to figure out how to hit, but I came back and won in extra innings. My favorite part of the game is the additional players. My favorite being J.R. House. The only let down is that Barry Bonds is not in the game. Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte are Astros, Alex Rodriguez and Alfonso Soriano are still with the Rangers and Yankees respectively and the free agent pool is as strong as ever. If you like baseball video games, I highly recommend this game."
4,MLB 2005 rocks!,"this is a great game.you can rob homeruns,make diving catches,and hit for power or average.I liked MLB 2005 much more than MLB 2004."
4,Quality Game with minor probs,"The game is the best there is out there right now. The graphics are solid, although not as crisp as one would prefer. One of the nice additions is the ability to control your team's respective AAA and AA clubs. While there is no ability to create an expansion franchise as there is in All-Star Baseball, this minor league feature sort of makes up for it.The announcing is terrific and the stadium replications are perfect. It's nice to see the big apple at Shea Stadium go up after hitting a homer in NY, or watching the eyes of the tiger light up in Detroit. The game requires some attention in dynasty mode as you need to really run three teams (MLB and Minors) and call up and send down regularly. Players wil send you e-mail complaining of playing time or contract status through out the year and will be annoyed if they find out they have been put on the trading block.All-in-all, the game would be a nice addition to any baseball fans VG library."
1,wrong size.,This fuel tank cap does not fit my 2004 Land Rover Discovery. I did not send it back because I was too lazy.
5,Feul Tank Cap.,Worked great!!! Tried others from Auto-Zone but didn't work nearly as well.I am very happy with this purchase.
4,Very Underrated Player,I give Reggie Miller Madd Props He isn't the Fastest or Best Rebounder or Dunk Specialist but as a Clutch Shooter&Money time Player He is something else.this Book is cool&is in line with His Vibe.He doesn't get all the due He should The Man Plays His Game Year in&Year out.still On His Game.
5,Best book of its era,Miller is a great writer and highly competitive player. What the book does is follow him for a season as he talks about all the teams and players he competes against. It is mindful to talk about his youth and time at UCLA in long flashback sequences. I liked it a whole lot.
5,A three-pt jump shot nothin' but net!!!,"Very well written. I keeps you on the edge of your seat. It really highlights all of the rivalry between Reggie and his friends, and in some cases his enemies."
5,"Dictionary of Analysis Calculus, and Differential Equations (comphensive Dictionary of Mathematics)","This book should provide any student of mathematics a complete listing of any term, or symbol, specialized functions, or common function name. It is well worth the small amount of money I paid for the reference book."
2,customer,I would give this item a 2 stars. It looks very nice.UV cut clip on broke after I wear it 3 times. Quality is poor.UV Cut Clip On Adjustable Visor-Orange W36S37B
3,a little scary for the younger set,Mig and Chris are 2 of the main characters in the story. Their father has disappeared and they go to live with their Aunt Maria in rabury on Sea. Their mother keeps the house for her and takes care of Aunt Maria. Mig and Chris start to see lots of strange things going on around them. What children they see seem like zombies and they see a ghost too. Could Aunt Maria be at the bottom of all these happenings?
4,Damn Good Guitar,"Damn straight solid South Texas guitar work and some pretty sultry vocals.Seems to me Danny plays an infusion of Hendrix, Clapton, Vaughan, Buchanan, Guy, Beck, and Zappa, all thrown in to his own stew of Texas guitar thunder."
1,No Show,I love Black and Decker products.I hate their support mechanism.I 've purchased several B&D; products through Amazon. The products(PVS1800) Dust buster and (NPS018)Power Scrubber are fine until you attempt to get replaceable items(filter for the Dust Buster)(additional brushes for the scrubber).I went through Amazon sanctioned vendors for both items and both couldn't supply the parts.I contacted the B&D; Factory Owned Center in Wethersfield CT and ordered the parts about 2 weeks ago and have not heard from them since then.It's sad that such a great group of products has such a lousy support system.
3,Not Totally Accurate,"Although this book is helpful and accurate on many levels, there are a few areas where the book is inaccurate. It states that alters form and die and new alters form. This is not accurate. Each alter is part of the personality and they do not die. They may go further back into the recesses of the mind but each alter is vital for healing and living. Each alter has part of a life - there is only one body but the psyche is broken in pieces. When healing takes place, each alters talents and abilities is vital to co-consciousness or integration. The other inaccuracy is the use of the term MPD. At the time of this book's publication the DSM IV was out and MPD was renamed Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). This ""disorder"" is a coping mechanism and not a personality disorder."
5,Highly recommended,"Of all the self help books I have read, this is the one book that was like a frying pan over the head in turning on the lights and getting me on the road to true recovery of everything from my past. I have actually bought several copies of this book to share with various friends and acquaintances. This book may be written for incest survivors, but I honestly feel that anyone who has experienced a childhood trauma of any kind, or faced alcoholism would benefit from reading this book. Clinical personnel would also benefit from understanding EXACTLY what a survivor is dealing with. I just can not say enough about how this book has helped me. I am now going for a psychology degree and doing my best to help others find their way through my own inspirational site. I have this book listed as a fave."
3,not what I meant to buy,"I expected this book to be about sexual abuse, in general. It's specifically about incest, so it wasn't what I'd meant to buy. My error."
5,This brings back memories....,"When I was younger, my relatives bought me two Koràl LP's, but in this CD-age I did not listen to them a lot. And now my husband got me this CD. I LOOOVE it. OK, so maybe I'm a hardrock chick (right), or maybe I like still this music, because I liked it when I was young. This CD had all my favourites : Maradj Velem (Stay with me), and the inevitably Kevés Voltam Neked (I wasn(t enough for you) that follows it. It's hardrock, but also mushy ballads. Hey, if Scorpion can do that. Ooh, and I forget Homok a Szélben, winner of Metronom 77, as you probably all remember (hah). Homok a Szélben means Dust in the Wind, I kid you not. If you like Uriah Heep, you'll like this one."
3,Great book but....,"It is a great book but alot of the hikes are hard to get to and really difficult. Some actually said you needed a machete!!! So a great book if you are comfortable with your spanish and route finding, but not so great if you are just looking for some good days or easier backpacking trips"
3,Super Reader,"There are three adventures involving the Saint. He sets up a sting to trap a man who is supposed to be dead. He deals with a bizarre locked room type of murder with some villains involved, and in the last, he saves a boatload of gold, and manages to avoid getting himself gassed through the device of a couple of bottles and some dirt."
5,This book has alot of great tips,I really liked reading this book. It was filled with alot of great tips. I especially liked that there were details on how to make your own beauty care treatments. I would recommend this book to others.
1,A disappointment.,"This ""book"" consists of ONE PAGE. This is adisappointment. If I had read the ""fine print"" carefully, Iwould have realized I was paying ( )for a single page. Not a good value. Not good at all... END"
4,Daily Meditations,"This book is used on a daily basis to help me with my thoughts for the day. I use it for my morning meditations and it helps set my mind for the day especially with the scriptural references. It is good for people like me, who do not have the time to spend for meditations, when it is rush, rush from the time you get up. I recommend it to readers, who have little time in the day as it will help you slow down a bit and give you a clearer vision."
5,Great movie,Martin Sheen could have taken a lesson from this movie in how he raised his drug addict son Charlie. Some people never learn. Charles Hyatt wanted Louis Gosset Jr's charactor imprisoned until of course he needed him and his skills. If you hate liberal BS you'll love this flick.
2,Very Unimpressed,"We bought this camera in May and it began having trouble with its lens cover closing in September. By October, it had become a real problem, but we were leaving on a trip with no time to get it fixed or replaced before we left. We took it to Nepal for a 24-day trek, and the lens cover stopped working at all about mid-way through the trip.Another significant problem we had was that it went through batteries at the rate of almost 2 per day by the 1st week of the trip. I can't tell you how much of a problem this was. We brought home a huge pile of batteries to recycle, while all of our friends (who were using much bigger and more complex cameras) went through 1 to 2 sets of batteries each. This is a seriously flawed camera, and we will be returning it pronto."
4,Very Easy to Use Camera,What I like about this camera it was very easy to use. I loaded the disk in the computer and was downloading the pictures with in 15 mintues. The only thing I did not like was the fact the flash is really bright and came make the pictures look washed out and you are taking a picture of a white item. However it picks up detail that my other camera could of never done
3,"Good camera, but poor quality construction","Nikon is made in China. What a shame. This could be a fine little camera, but the quality of the case is ""cheap"" and the lens covers stopped working two weeks after I bought it. The camera is now in the mail to the Nikon service center. We'll see what kind of service it gets, and how quickly I get it back -- either fixed or a replacement."
1,NIKON L12 LASTS ONE WEEK,I bought a Nikon L12 and it lasted one week - just died! I sent the camera back to Nikon. They refuse to replace my camera or fix it. Don't buy any Nikon products. I bought it because of its AA battery capabilities because its hard to find electricity in many outback places - but after one week all the batteries I tried did not work. Buy a Canon Product instead - I own two digital PowerShots and they work great (just buy an extra rechargable battery).
1,Picture quality very poor,Returned this within 2 days - pictures were not bright - they were washed out.
2,"Good material, leaks at drink valve while hiking, leaks at opening if not upright","Pros: Lightweight, good plastic, no bad taste, interior vertical support useful, easy to closeCons: Intermittent dripping from drink valve while hiking, leaked about 4 oz of water while supine in my trunk driving to the trailheadBottom line: wish I'd tried the platypus. I owned a Camelbak that lasted for 10 years before leaking. I thought this closure method would be more desirable than having to turn and tighten the Camelbak, and later loosen with difficulty -- especially in winter camping."
3,As Real as it Gets...,"Wonderfully written, this book grasps reality in today's busy world filled with money, love, family life, power, business, and the consequences of living for today & not caring about tomorrow. A book that you don't think to put down until you've finished reading it."
5,Excellent advice and excellent predictor of the 90's,"This book offers great investing advice as well as a historic recap of past events. I never realized I was a contrarian myself until I read this book.Reading it in 1999 I can only wish I had read it in 1990 as it predicted many of the decade's economic events: low inflation and budget surpluses.Even though it predicts the Dow at 4000-5000 by New Years's Eve 2000, who would have thought the Dow would be at 11,000+?The investing tips this book provides are timeless and once you start reading this book you can not stop. I wish this author would write a book about the next millennium, I'd be the first one to buy it."
5,Great book on contrary investing!,"Richard Band's books on contrary investing are a must for anyone who understands that trading agasint the crowd is what leads to winning trades. I highly recommend this book! Mitchell Holland, Author ""The Master Trader"" http://www.trillions.com/"
2,Poor quality,"These are super cute, and I understand that I got them for a pretty good price; HOWEVER, I would NEVER have paid the full price for these. Before I even put them on the bed I washed them and they fuzzed. I love the design as does my son but don't intend on these lasting for more than a few seasons, let alone for everyday use."
4,Great for the price,"The material looks little cheap but it is soooooo worth the price. If you are looking for a temporary sheet set, dont want to spend a lot, this one is for you. It is soft and prints are pretty. But I dont think this will withstand lots of washing."
5,EXCELLENT QUALITY...AFTER FIRST WASH!!!,I ordered only 1 set and when i saw the quality ordered 7 sets more!!other reviews mention about poor quality and the fabric thiner after one wash and they are not soft???.....I don't know what they want....this sheet set is good quality because i wash every 3 days my beeding and still are very soft i think the other customers has to buy ultra plush blanket and use as sheet because i don't know other type the sheet soft as flannel !Any way I recommend this sheets and for this price is good deal...Macys has flannel sheet set for $20 on sale!!
4,the smooth penguin,"This is a very comfortable bedsheet, it easily puts one to sleep...so good for this winter cold weather, like snuggling a soft teddy bear...the texture is great I hope this will last....it's worth buying it."
5,Very soft and cute,I ordered these sheets for my 12 year old daughter who loves penguins. We live in SD where it gets really cold in the winter so flannel sheets are a must for our beds. I washed these sheets and then put them on the bed. They are very soft and fuzzy and my daughter loved how warm they felt when she crawled into bed.
3,You get what you pay for-Not Luxury but suit basic needs,"I bought these for my son. They are not super soft luxury flannel, but again for less than $10.00, what would you expect. The gram weight is clearly stated.After washing, following manufacturers instructions(cold water, low heat dryer)they came out just fine. They softened quite a bit and he is thrilled with them.If I get one season out of them, I will be happy, however, I think they will last much longer than that."
1,Low quality item,"I got one Pike Street 135-Gram Fannel sheet sets and two duvet covers. I'm very disappointed. The fabrics are of very poor quality, the fabric thins after one wash and also fuzzes out (and they are not soft). They look like they won't last after a couple of washes or a few months' usage. Is it worth the price? NO, I've gotten better quality for the same price on other sheet sets and duvet covers from Amazon before."
2,"You win some, you lose some...","Well. I got some other flannel sheets on sale from Amazon and they have been great. Despite a multitude of happy reviews on these penguin sheets -- these are not so great.I've washed them once, and they pilled horribly. They're not going to last long. Thankfully I spent less than $10, and at least my daughter thinks they are adorable."
3,"Good enough content, cheaply presented",The content is pretty good. The book is short and cheaply made (very basic font on cheap paper).
4,A good start,I really like this book!! This is my second copy because the first book was misplaced. I would recommend it to everyone because it helps you to conduct a basic examination for your spanish speaking patients.
2,Maybe Next Year.....,"It had all the potential of being a great game and almost fools you into believing it. Almost I said. The batting is hard to get use to but once you do it's pretty fun but there is a bug with not being able to hit with Lefties. Thats right, they barely get hits and you can forget about hitting homeruns with them. Also the dynasty mode is screwed up, the players just don't progress to become stars or even average players. The players feel slow and the controls somewhat cumbersome. The dyanasty bug and the lefty bug are too big to ignore. Pass this game up."
2,No online play = teh ...,A decent effort but not that many improvements over last year. A solid game but no online play = rental only.
2,"2 stars, because MLB Slugfest is better!!","This game is ok, because has bascally no fun into it being relastic. If you are under 13 years of age then ok, But you should get the (989 sports) seris> if you are 13 years of age or older, then get MLB Slugfest!Pros of MLB 2004=Nice hittingCons=Graphics are ok but need some workCan't really steel a baseCan't get a player out by throwing it to firstbase before the player slids back on first baseNo arguments!!!!! BLAH!!!"
3,Ball four? Please?,"Nobody walks. Ever. Sadly, it seems EA is more interested in flashy graphics than realism. Gee, who'd a figured? I play OOTP Baseball 6.0. No graphics, but stats are right on."
3,So so.,"Not all that great. The graphics weren't as good as the other reviews made them out. I liked the effort that went into making the crowds react correctly, but they all looked like botched versions of ""The Sims"" characters. The other frustrating thing was the computer always making diving catches. I could barely get any hits, and it's not realistic since the pros don't do it that way."
4,Wow! Holy Cow!,"This game you need in your collection, This game has ever thing you could ever want in a baseball game. You truly get your money's worth if you get this game. The extras in the are special. Rare team jerseys dating back to the ""1903"" , Old ball park such as the ""AstroDome and the famous Polo Grounds, old time Hall of Famers ( Babe Ruth, Nolan Ryan, Reggie Jackson, lou Gehrig, Ted Willaims, Cy Young, Tom Seaver, Catfish Hunter, Bob Gibson, Ty Cobb, Jackie Robinson, Joe Morgan, Willie Stargell and many , many more."
4,MVP 2004 is a thing of beauty!!!,I've had this game for about three days and cannot stop playing.Everything in this game flows very smooth with a pretty moderate gameplay speed.A good improvement from last year.My only complaints are is the easy ability to hit homeruns in two-player mode.The final score could reach up to about 15 to 16 pts. on average.5 stars *****. GOOD JOB EA SPORTS!!!
4,No-Brainer,"I've been into baseball video games since RBI Baseball in the 80's. Nothing has come close to RBI in terms of gameplay since. Well move over RBI, there's a new Dynasty in town and it's name is MVP. You will not regret buying this game other than that it will turn you into a couch potato who never wants to quit playing because a 162-game season is long, but so damn fun! Get this game and you'll think me."
5,No Barry Bonds?,This is a great game. I thought it has great gameplay and the graphics are unbeleivable. The dynasty mode is great too and the replays look just like real. But. . . There is one problem. . .THERE IS NO BARRY BONDS! I dont know why hes not in the game. He is nonarguably one of the best players in the game of baseball. (even though hes got the asterisk for possible steroids).Still I would highly recommend this game to whoever loves baseball or likes good sports video games.
4,"Re : WHERES BARRY BONDS?!,","WHERES BARRY BONDS???!!! Answer - BONDS Refuses to participate in these games. Because he is the ONLY MLB player to have his own ROYALTY system. For BONDS to be in this GAME , EA would have to pay him from A huge Amount of $$ separately all other MLB players. Answer- BONDS is a greddy bum!"
4,Not quite perfect but close 4.5 stars,"Without out a doubt this is the best baseball game available. EA has never quite been able to match the success of their madden franchise with baseball, but this one comes close. For the reviewer with the complaint about Barry Bonds not being included in the game: this is not EA's fault. Bonds is no longer a part of the MLB players association therefore no baseball game you buy this year and in future seasons (unless Bonds decides to rejoin the players assoc.)will feature Bonds because only players that belong to the union can have their name or likeness used in mlb video games, advertisements, etc. If you want Bonds in the game just go change the name of the left fielder get last seasons stats off cbs sportsline or espn.com and you'll be set. This is what I did and his numbers ended up pretty comparable. He made the NL all star team as a starter in the season I am currently playing."
4,MVP Baseball 2004,"This is a good game. I just wanted to address the constant complaints about Bonds not being in the game. WHO CARES IF A STEROID USER DOESN'T WANT TO BE A PART OF THE MLBPA AND THUS CANNOT BE PUT INTO THE GAME?? Yes you can just edit the guy and get Bonds if you really care that much, but I think you should leave him off as a reminder that overrated steroid users don't deserve to be in these games. Do you want McGwire or Canseco in there too?? You got Sosa, how many more juicers do you need? Just play the game, cause it really is cool and the franchise mode (or dynasty) is deep and very addictive. Create a player could be better, as personally I wanted to create a Willie McGee but there was no option that looked goofy enough for that. Bring up a youngster from the minors and see if they are able to put up the numbers that Mr Pujols (who deserves at LEAST 1 of the MVPs given to Bonds in the last 3 years, especially last year) put up, or at least make a contribution to the squad."
4,MVP 04,"MVP is a great improvement over baseball games for PS2 in the past. The pitching is hard to get at first (when you don't know when to stop the slider...) but once you play for a little bit it is easy. The batting takes a little while to get used to. My first game I lost 23-1, however after taking some BP I managed to score 12 runs in my next game, so don't give up on batting/pitching just get used to the learning curve. Overall, MVP is a very deep game which should keep you playing for hours and hours...."
4,smooth,"This game rocks.It has everything u want in a baseball video game. There is a couple glitches but mark my words, this game is not bad."
4,MVP,This game is plain great. I love sports games and especially baseball games. This is definently the best baseball game ive ever played. I recomend it to anyone who asks for a great game. Definently worth the 50 bucks.
4,Great baseball game,"This is a very fun game. There are a lot of things I like and only a few things that aren't too good. The graphics are great and the gameplay is a lot of fun. The main thing I dislike is the pitch meter. I wish it wasn't so complicated to just throw one pitch. But you can quickly get used to it. The announcers are annoying, but it's like that in all the games.The game modes are good. There is no Season mode, though. And I think that is a big loss. Legacy mode lets you manage an organization. You can make contracts, try to get your team goals, watch your player's happiness and your team's chemistry, and just win year after year. There is also a Home Run Showdown and Pitcher Showdown. You are able to unlock alternate uniforms, historic players, historic stadiums, and some other things.I recommend trying this game."
5,MVP 2004 - a good buy,"MVP Baseball 2004 is a pretty good game. I have played most of the other games (except ESPN MLB because it's taking so long to release) and this is the best out there so far. The graphics are great, it's not hard to learn, the pitching and hitting engines are great too. Overall, this is a fun game. I purchased ASB 2004 last year, and this is a much better game than that was. ASB 2005 is much better than ASB 2004, but still not as good as MVP 2004. I do have a few issues, but nothing that makes the game bad. The CPU makes the diving catch in the outfield 99.9% of the time, which is a real bummer. They also run way too fast. However, you can tweak settings in MVP 2004 to make it more realistic. The game froze on me once, for unknown reasons. Overall, this is a good buy."
4,Legendary Game,"This game is awesome. I have owned it since it came out and i still play it a year after. I have yet to throw a no hitter, yet i have come close. The greatest thing about this game is that you not only draft your ""new blood"" but you develop your team through dynasty. I am in 2035 and i have just ended a three year drought (cap reasons and bad trades.) Also save point and play with the legends and heroes of old. I cant be touched with Satchel Paige. Last ganme I threw him against a friend 7 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 9 Ks.. Its amazing. Problem was i threw alot of pitches. WARNING mistake pitches in this game go far and can decide numerous tournaments among friends. BUY IT PEOPLE"
4,uninformed,"people are saying barry bonds should be on this game, but if they are true fans they would know that ea sports can't use his name. he's not with the MLBPA anymore."
2,Horrible Vacuum..,"I also had bad luck with this product. It over heats, needs new filters every 3 months or so, filter needs to be cleaned almost daily or no suction. I like the other reviewers had numerous problems with overheating. I am so very disappointed in this product."
4,very good product,"For the price,this is a great option to a less expensive vacume. The bottom empty bagless canister is great and the suction stands up to pet hair and dust.Being a previous Rainbow owner,I am hard to impress,but for the price,it's worth the money."
2,why did I buy this monster vacuum,"I must have been out of my mind to spend so much for something that is wayyyyyyy too heavy, bulky and wide to do what I need done.. I only wanted it for upstairs in my townhome to clean around the floor from any hair my cats may have deposited.. I think that this vacuum is not any better than the smaller ones with the same amount of amps (12) that are very cheap to buy.. Try pushing this one around and lifting it..plus now there are two sides to clean instead of one and it doesnt seem to work that well on the bare floors downstairs. There is more area downstairs without furniture where it could have a clear path, but if I have to put on a bare floor tool every time I used it, or an attachment just to get in spaces I normally could get into, then who needs it.. If the suction does go, as the previous person said, then Dirt Devil will surely hear from me and it will not be pretty."
1,MUCH HATE!,"Do NOT waste your money on this piece of junk vacuum. It worked for about a month before losing suction. This was the 2nd Dirt Devil vacuum I have purchased in the past 4 years... it will be the last. The filter is a pain to clean, the rotating furniture attachment is a joke, and it is too heavy to drag up the stairs. VERY disappointing purchase!!"
1,Do Not Buy This!,"Like everyone else, I loved this vaccuum at first, after the first few times I used it, it was horrible! The little brush attachement for furniture doesn't spin as soon as I put it on my couch to use it. I have to empty the bagless canisters after every cleaning, to do this I get dirt all over the garbage can and floor. Plus I have to stick my hand up in it to get all the hair and whatnot that has twisted around the spinning things.Now to be fair, I do have 3 dogs. So I realize I have more hair/fur in my carpet than most people. BUT... I only use this vaccuum to clean the area rug in my living room and the bedrooms. That is it. The rest is hardwood that I sweep (I have to because if I try to use this vaccuum on the bare floor, it spits out everything behind it onto my feet)I think DirtDevil should be ashamed at selling this product. It's horrible. And I'm not even mentioning the hard to find expensive filters that need to be replaced on a regular basis (kind of like a BAG)."
3,not bad,my wife work saturday so i try to help all i can got tried using a piece of junk big lots had this for 69.00 real happy with it the only promblem is the name being a preacher in christ i call it devil is dirt
1,HATE WASTING MY TIME!,"I bought this because I was trying to stay away from 'work one year eurekas.' In that aspect it was a success. It lasted for two. It is heavy, too heavy to do stairs with, and looks substantial but a Dyson it is NOT! It couldnt live up to the challenge of pet hair and was cumbersome to maneuver. It finally died after two years, and my DH is one that takes them apart and rescusitates them for a bit longer. Not bad since eurekas tend to die after a year.We finally did get that dyson and boy did we see the difference. Amazing for heavy duty spring cleaning. For the downstairs every day use, I HIGHLY recommend a Bissell Helix I think is the name. Amazing suction on pet hair. If I have to replace that every year, I'll do so gladly because it cleans really well"
4,good vacuum,Ive had no problem with this vacuum. I dont know why so many people hate it. I use it for pet hair and it works better than any other vacuum Ive bought so far.
2,Not great for pet hair,"I purchased this vacuum a week ago and first had problems with the instructions that did not tell you how to correctly put the handle, etc. on. Plus, they shorted me one screw! Anyway, I was not impressed with the vacuum after having played with all of the height settings. I have two cats and I had to go over the same spots several times to get the hair up (it just rolled the hair into balls on the carpet) Also, it did not pick up larger pieces of dirt very well. I had to return it to the store. I'm now in search of a good vacuum!"
1,dirt devil d2 reaction cyclonic,work vacuum ever bought ...never should have purchaseddoesn't pick up anythingjust creates a lot of dustit's just a replica of the windtunnel by hooverwhat in the worldi paid $168 for junk
1,NEVER AGAIN!!!,"I got this system home, and it requires a thing called a receiver to hook it up, which costs [extra]... So unless you got a receiver I suggest you not buy this..."
4,Great Deal,"The center, front and rear speakers here are remarkable. I have friends who have spent several hundred dollars on sets of speakers, and there is really no noticeable difference in sound quality. However, the subwoofer here is simply a waste of space. Just toss it. Buy yourself a high quality sub. When combined with these speakers, you'll have a great home theater set up, and you'll still have paid less than your friends."
5,"Yes, I loved it","Marrianne Williamson's work is both real and honest. Rather than couch things in a concepts that are alien or extremely religious, she talks to you about the realities of existing. Of how things will not always be easy, about how you will lose your way, and honestly how to see people clearly. Growth is messy, it's not neat, maturity is not easy, nor is spirtiuality delicate work, but with assistance from a tape like this you can see yourself clearly and how to bridge yourself from concept to human to spiritual being."
2,Short and stupid is no way to go through life son.,"Sure, I could be like every one else and just look at the action but, unfortunatly, I can't. First things first, I have no idea when this movie could have happened in the series. If you saw the first episode of Dragon Ball Z you'd know that everyone was surprised by Goku having a son.They were not surprised a bit in the movie. Also,The movie is way too short.48 minutes of action is not enough for me.There are also enemies that look like panzys.They don't look challenging just stupid. The storyline is even worse. Too simple. If only it was as good as The World's Strongest I might have enjoyed it more.There is only one thing I like about the movie, It has a hell of a lot of action. Other than that forget it."
5,Dragon Ball Z is very pumped up And the action never stops!!,"Dragon Ball Z Is one of the best Anime movies I've seen, The T.V. series is cool, with non-stop action between good and evil with great music, excellent characters who kick butt: Goku, Gohan, Yamucha, Piccolo, and more!! I seriously recommend this tape!! Buy now!!"
5,Original Title Return My Gohan,"When hell-bent on destruction of mankind Garlic Junior is granted eternal life, Goku the world's strongest rushes to the scene only to find chaos. Always told to use his overwhelming power for the good of mankind, Goku battles with his rival Piccolo to slay Garlic Junior. With the fate of the world resting on thier shoulders, can Goku and Piccolo win. Especially, against an immortal being. Probably. There is a 62% chance of victory."
4,LOTS OF ACTION! bad timing.,"I'm a huge dragonball fan and love amine. This is the type of amine that makes Japan better in the cartoon world than America. There were people fighting that I never thought I would see (che che,kame) the only problem was when gohan showed his true powers. It was cool but should've only been in the Radits saga."
4,The funnest DBZ movie...,"Dead Zone is the funnest DBZ movie I have seen. Garlic Jr. has come to Gokus house to get a dragon ball from Gohan. Goku goes after Garlic Jr. to the dead zone. there is a fight. the bad guys are very funny. THeir moves are good to. I like this movie, and I wouldsay that if you like DBZ you should see this movie."
5,"Three words for you. ""GOHAN KICK'S A**""","Is it good or is it good, all Gohan fans out there must see this one. Here is where Gohan's hidden powers apear for the first time. You show them Gohan, A 5 STAR MOVIE, BUY IT IF YOU CAN."
5,the ocean dub of dead zone,"The dvd contains both the original(ocean dubbed) or japenese(with english subs) versions on one uncut dvd. the movie itself is great, and the ocean dub english track is really good. but if you don't like it, you can watch it in japenese with english subs, or buy the funimation version.the dvd contains some great bonus features such as character bios and a funny joke about namek DVD players.Although their are better versions for sound and picture, this is great for ocean dub fans. A must buy."
4,DEAD ZONE,First off get this Movie Uncut so you can see the cut part at the begining so you can understand it more and Pionneer keeps all the so called bad words or swearing and its not just the hell word either. Second I can't stand when people ask when the movie takes place in the the show. None of the movies take place anywhere in the episodes because they are not EPISODES they are MOVIES! The only movie that really goes with the episodes is movie 9. This is a great buy if its uncut and not taped from Toonami.
4,dragonball Z is a hand grenade,"when i first saw this movie i was sick and disgusted. to think that children are watching this kind of blasphemy and taking pleasure in seeing harmless animals beaten with dragonballz and other blunt objects. these sadistic products of incestual creation should be torn from their sadistically minded ways. this is an insult to the very essence of humanity itself as it lacks any property of what a scientist might call ""industrial"". this movie should be beaten over its own head by itself for being so harshly pleasing to violent children. and so he spaketh."
2,"Lots of action, not much story...","There's only so much story you can tell in a 45-minute movie and ""Dragon Ball Z: The Movie- Dead Zone"" proves this point. The plot is paper-thin and this movie is very heavy on action. To top it off, the animation really isn't all that great. I suppose there's some market for ""DBZ,"" and perhaps I'm not one of them, but I feel like a story would've helped this mini-film a lot. What little story there is involves Goku going to rescue his son Gohan from a weird little guy named Garlic Jr., who has collected all the dragon balls together and wished for immortality. Violence ensues. There are much better anime movies out there. Do you really want to spend your money on this one?"
2,I agree TOO Short,Me and my friends watched it and we have to say it was TOO SHORT and it dosen't hook into the series or seem to come before it what was the creator thinking when he made this movie?
3,The first is not always the worst.,"This movie is OK, although it's nothing compared to Movies 8-12. And for all you dubbies, there aren't just 3 movies. The total number of movies released in Japan is thirteen (13!). Graphics: 6 out of 10. Sound: 7 out of 10. Plot: 4 out of 10."
4,Dragonball Z -- Better in Japanese,"This movie suffers from the same downfalls of all Dragonball Z movies: Lame plot, stupid villains and weak storyline. However, having said that it can be noted that the DVD is a MUST HAVE! The features on the DVD are definitely worth every penny. Being able to finally see Dragonball Z in its original japanese with subtitles is excellent. The only problem being that you'll want to see ALL the Dragonball Z like that and it's not available. Besides the problems with the movie itself this DVD is a must have. Even with a lame plot I watched it twice the first night I had it. Also, the missing scenes from the TV show are a lot of fun."
4,Sweetest Raw Action,"This production was a great success in the fact that the action was not the typical blow by blow never ending combat sequence. There was a uniqueness to every second that kept you on the edge of your seat and had you rooting for the home-team. As one of the earlier movies in the series, for its time, this is a must see movie."
1,You could write this with the info you already know,"This book is easily one of the least informative and poorly written leaflets I have ever purchased. Most of the info is ridiculous and unsafe. There are many other books, as well as information on the internet that would be of more help to you than this waste of your time."
5,5 years of outside use!,"I've had this rope tied up in trees for almost 5 years, it just now decided to start coming apart at the top. It wasn't something I used daily, but it had seen plenty of climbing and swinging. It worked great as a rope and even broke in such a way that didn't leave me falling 10-15 feet to the ground. I'm back to buy another(although the price has increased almost 50 percent). It worked great for something not recommended for outside use."
5,Great book,This is such a great book to have especially for people studying nursing I bought this for a friend who was taking up nursing.
5,Excellent product would never use anything else,"I have used a lot of flea & tick repellants over the years, but this is the only product that really works! Once a month between the shoulders & my dog is good to go wherever we decide to wander. No more messy dips or powders to get in the eyes, mouth or ears, not to mention all over me. I do wear disposable gloves when I apply it just so I am sure there is no residue left on my skin when I am done with the application. I have been using Frontline Top Spot for 11 years."
3,Just Not My Thing,"Overall, well written. If you like graphic sex scenes, you'll like it much better than I did. I guess, I'm looking for more story."
3,It was alright.....,"This is not a terrible anthology, but it wasn't great. Many of the 22 stories were forgetable, but a few were good, such as Bird Count by Jane Yolen, Persephone by Wendy Froud (I wish this had been longer), and The House of Nine Doors by Ellen Kushner. Most of the other stories were mildly erotic at best. Still, they were all pretty creative. If you're into sci-fi and fantasy stories, you'll probably enjoy it. If you only want good erotica, you might want to pass this by."
2,"OKAY, KIND OF WIERD","Not quite what I expected. The stories were a little wierd. There was quite a bit of sex, but towards the end, it seemed tedious. There really wasn't any point in the act. Some of the stories were good. I enjoyed the one about the Acorn, Leaf woman. Mainly because of the Sidhe being in ""our time"" and known and descriminated against. I also like the Vampire one (there was only one Vampire story), but it ended abruptly. There was one about a ""bird man"" it was very short but cute. As for the book being ""erotic"", it didn't give me a rise. The stories were either humiliating and mean (the one about incest), or you just couldn't feel for any of the characters in any of the stories. If your a romance reader, or a lover of paranormal stories, save your money. There just doesn't seem to be any substance in any of these stories to warrant a good read. If you like off-the-wall stuff, then maybe this is for you."
2,Weak in the knees,"OK, I mainly bought this book because of Neil Gaiman. I love his work in Sandman and with Neverwhere. Of course, I read his short story first. It was OK, but a little weak, I felt, and definitly too short. As I branched out into the other short stories, the book continued to become worse. To the unread eye and someone who feels the need to read this, it's OK. Passible. However, I feel that there was very littly literary quality to it and many stories really served no purpose.I've written better material then some of the stuff in this book. Trust me. That's saying something."
4,A Nostalgic Look at the Family,"Mildred Kovar wrote simply and charmingly about her family in McLeod Co, MN. The book gives insight into the lives of a family with roots in Czech Republic, their struggles, joys, and togetherness. Nice easy read."
2,FOR NOVICES ONLY!,"I have only 6 months experience in the world of dSLRs (i.e., I know almost nothing...) and I found this book to offer no extra info beyond the camera's original user manual. Good descriptions of the camera functions but no real tips or recommendations for how to use/setup camera. If you already know the absolute basics and want to learn how to use the camera better, don't spend your money on this book -- instead suggest you check out the various 350d forum groups on the internet. You'll learn tons from other, more experienced users."
4,EOS Digital Rebel Guide Does The Job,This is pretty much what you'd expect - a general elaboration on the manual giving a second chance to get your head around stuff and placing the XTs many features into greater context. Not invaluable but many new to Digital SLR will find it useful.
4,Good supplement to owners manual,This book is written in understandable English and is a good additional tool to the manual that comes with the camera.
3,Great companion for amateur photographers,I would have loved to see some more colored pictures comparing with or without the added effect
1,Beware,"This booklet (it's quite small) is not what you might expect.Consider these facts before purchasing:--About half of the book is not specific to the Digital Rebel--it's general photography basics. Choosing a lens, how to photograph landscapes, etc. In other words, filler.--It's all in black and white.--There are *no* example illustrations of the settings on the Rebel. So if they are talking about say, AWB, there are no illustrations about where the buttons are, what the camera display shows when buttons are pressed, etc. This is true throughout the booklet; it talks about settings, but never shows them.Nutshell: this appears to be a very short booklet on the Rebel with a few general discussions on a few of the Rebel's features. However, there are no illustrations, not everything is covered, and one gets the feeling it was then filled out with generic information (including a long list of the accessories available at the end of the book).The manual that comes with the camera is 10x better...."
3,Better Than the Manual,"I am in between on this one. I agree that much of the material is available in the User's Manual. However, the topics are organized differently and presented in a format that is easier to follow. The manual is a user's guide describing the many functions of the camera. The book takes this information a step further and explains the purpose of these functions and how to make the most of them. The book does seem to be written by an enthusiast of the camera and may not be totally objective."
3,Magic Lantern's guide to the Canon Digital Rebel XT,"I am a rookie SLR operator, this book clearly centers on explaining the operation of the controls of the XT, it does not get much past this. For those of you who already know it, then don't buy it, but for us 'rooks' it was good. Now if only the spine of the binding did not fall apart in the first week, and I take care of my books!"
5,Excellent Ironclad Info,"This is one of several slim volumes devoted to the history of the earliest American iron-clad warships. This volume focuses on the Confederate states approach to developing iron covered ships to aid in their efforts to break the Union naval blockade. The book is full of interesting information on all aspects of the development of Confederate style of early iron-armored battle ships - including not only the original 'Merrimack/Virginia' but also an array of fascinating variations on the theme. The illustrations are particularly nice featuring rare archival photos, period engravings, cut-a-way drawings of the interior workings, and specially commissioned paintings. Highly recommended for those interested in these unusual early fighting ships."
3,"Works well enough, but beware of plastic","I got this blender as a Bridal shower gift, and it was wonderful for a while. The blender itself works fine most of the time, but I did find that it made odd noises. After a while the plastic on the base cracked, just a bit, but then it cracked more and more to the point that there's only a tiny space now that isn't cracked. this creates quite a problem since it causes the entire blender to tip, meaning that the pieces that need to connect in order for the blade to turn cannot connect. Hence, I have a broken blender all because of cheap plastic. My advice is to spend a little more money and get something that isn't so cheaply made."
2,Food processor disapointing.,"The quality of the blender is par for the course. The food processor on the other hand was very disapointing. We have tried slicing 3 different types of cheese that the manual said could be sliced, all of them crumbled. On top of that, it made a loud bang noise the 3rd-4th time we used it. Haven't used the food processor since. Just glad I got this on sale. Definately would not reccomend."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I purchased this blender just over a year ago and it is already broken. The motor has malfunctioned in a severe way. If I hold the base upside-down, the motor will run but sparks fly out of it. Due to the inability to blend upside-down and the fear of sparks, this appliance is now useless junk. I contacted Hamilton Beach to try and get some satisfaction but they claimed it must have broke because I did not know how to use it. How hard would it have been to work with me instead of blaming me? Very disappointed in this product and I will now look for a new blender that is actually a quality product."
3,It does it's job...minor issues though...,"A nice blender/processor combo. Works great, fit and finish are nice, the pitcher DOES NOT pour well since the lip of the jar is badly designed. Expect to find your blended drinks running down the side of the jar w/ every pour. Otherwise it works well."
2,Not what is claims,Not satisfied with its claims. Doesnt do some processing as it claims it does.Not really a food processor.
3,Not reliable,"I bought this one year ago for $40 and the motor stopped unexpectedly. Thinking that it had only one yr. warranty I threw it away. Well, it has 3 yrs. warranty and they need the original to replace the motor. Here I am shopping for the next one"
2,Worked great while it lasted,"I bought this blender about a year and a half ago. I used it mostly to make smoothies in the summertime. But the last time I tried to make them the engine started smoking and now I'm in the market for a new one and I won't be purchasing the same brand or model.The food processor worked good for grating cheese, but s-blade attachment was a pain to use, because it barely chops and just pushes the food to the side. But I don't have a whole lot of need for the food processor so on those few occasions, I'd rather deal with what I had instead of spending big bucks for a real one."
3,Don't buy this for the food processor,"This product was a nice idea in theory, but in practicality it only works well as a blender. The food processor is really not useful for anything except maybe rough dicing. The larger pieces of food tend to not be circulated to where the blade rotates, while the smaller pieces of food get stuck where the blade is and you end up with every uneven particles. The blender, however, is good enough by my standards. It has nice thick glass and is fine for crushing ice and making smoothies."
3,"Changing Lenses, A review",Howard Zehr is a christian who is is compassionate towards people caught up in the criminal justice system. Zehr looks at the criminal justice system from different perspectives: from the offender's and the victim's perspectives. He points out that there is tragedy in the number of people caught up in the justice system.
1,true blood season four,True Blood season four sucks so bad.Sam story was interesting .Tara story went way off the charts it was bad.Sookie storyline even though i love sookie her story line was a joke.Bill's story stinks to high heaven.i hope season five is better then the fourth that is if i watch. Season four was very very disppointed.
1,"So, so, SO awful","The reason I still watch ""True Blood"" is because it's so bad, it's comical. I recently read an article that quoted several cast members, and I got the sense that they all know how ridiculous the show is as well, which is good. Everything is just so outlandish and STUPID. I hate almost all of the characters. I was excited about the potential of an Eric/Sookie hookup this season (because Eric is HOT...that is the second reason why I still watch the show), but in my opinion that totally fizzled out and wasn't nearly as interesting as it could have been. The idea of integrating witches into the storyline this season was also great, but I think the way it played out was awful. I could go on and on about everything that sucks about this show, but I will just say that if you don't already watch it, there is absolutely no reason to start now. This season cost me 13 hours of my life that I will never get back!"
1,Not for me,"Watched the short clip, I did not like it at all and would never watch this series, not for me."
3,true blood,well i have to watch it on june 6 when it comes back last year it eas ok not much to talk about but i will watch it again the first year it was great well we will see it this season well we will se i will watch the 4charlene
1,The worst,This was a crappy season. Not because it didn't resemble the books at all. It sucked because nothing made sense and the multiple character assasinations are unforgiveable.Bill and his new position... big laugh.Eric running around like a teenager and Sook acting like his mother. Gross.absolutely no one was likeable. and the person at the tip top of the list is sookie. just stupid and annoying.
5,Well...,What can I say... If you are a True Blood fan you have to get this. There is nothing like having the whole season available to watch again and again at your fingertips. And the Blue Ray picture is superb.
5,Not for me,"I bought this for my daughter, I do not watch True Blood. It was a last years Christmas present. The reason I rated it ""I love it"" is because my daughter told me she loved. The DVD's were in good condition and she still watches it."
5,"Five, five, five.....","As a diehard True Blood fan, I am like one of the seagulls in Finding Nemo. Five! Five! Five! I must give each one five stars. I love this show. It's the perfect blend of camp, sex, twists, fantasy and pure escapist television."
5,Romantic Horrific,This series of Vamp movies is pretty good. There is a lot of steam and love in between. The end of each episodes keeps you wanting more. There is no way you are going to miss the next episode unless you are tied to a chair in another room. They cover just about every creature that may go bump in the night. If you want witches they are in there. If you want werewolves they'll be baying at the moon. Zombies you bet! I'm waiting for what is next. You will too.
5,True Blood season 4,"I have really enjoy this series, they could not done it any better, hope it contines for a long time."
5,Love this show,Never thought I would get into a show like this but I love it!!! Very reasonable price and now I can watch whenever I want.
5,Fantastic,This edition is fantastic!! Very beautiful this edition!! every collecttors shoud have this!! this tv serie is alson!! i apriciate!!
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!,"Best season of them all! Can't wait to see season 6, season 5 was just a big build up to season 6!"
4,Great Show,"Love the seasons so worth it to any True Blood Fan or Vamprie story follower. If you have yet to start watching, what are you waiting for???"
4,Well done,Stuck to it's story line and is still interesting. It still has it's twists and turns and the unexpected. Thumbs up HBO
1,Really Crappy Audio on Blu-Ray,"Blu-Ray is supposed to be in audiophile quality - at least that's how it's been touted. Well, ""True Blood, Season 4"" has totally crappy audio on the end credits, every single one of them, where often the best music is found. It appears that the discs' manufacturer, HBO/Time Warner has used TIME-COMPRESSED video and audio for the end credits. It sounds like a very grainy phasing or flanging and it's something I have heard before on TV shows they time compress. These digital audio artifacts are not pleasing to listen to, and when they use (badly) a song I'm very fond of like Siouxsie and the Banshees' ""Spellbound"", it is infuriating. I did not spend $50 on a Blu-Ray set for a birthday present to give someone headache inducing digital audio artifacts. It's cheap, it's shoddy and I would not suggest you purchase this set until they fix it."
2,True Blood Could Do Better!,True Blood Season 4 was the weirdest by far! This season was very different it made no real sense! I hope season 5 will be better! I will be purchasing season 4 but only because its one of my favorite shows!!! I hope and pray for HBO to out do this season!!!
2,Not as good as the previous seasons.... unfocused and poorly written,"I'm a big fan of True Blood, the HBO series, enough so that I've bought all of the DVD sets. However........Season 4 was pretty bad. I liked Eric as an amnesiac, and his relationship with Sookie (till he regained his memory). That's about it.The other storylines rambled. Numerous plot threads (such as Tara's career as a fighter, and a shapeshifter's impersonation of a human character's son) seemed initially interesting, but fizzled midway through the season without connecting with the overall (muddled, rambling) story arc. The writing was uneven, and made little sense. The dialogue, which sparkled in the first two seasons, was frankly bad and hard to listen to, reminiscent of many poorly written sci fi channel series, in Season 4. The vampire characters in particular were watered down and soppy.I've seen this sort of degeneration, with passing seasons, happen with other series; it's sad to see it happening with True Blood."
2,Cheesy,"Very cheesy, such a disappointment to see the show go further and further down hill since the end of season one."
3,Not as good as the past seasons.,True Blood seems to be going downhill and it shows this season. They better pick up the pace and unpredictability or it will become a snoozer
5,Denise Adkins,"As always I love ""True Blood"" especially when Eric promotes Bill Compton's election speech with, ""Who do you trust,a vampire or a politician."" I feel you can't trust either of them since they love to suck the blood out of you."
3,Not as good as the previous seasons,The parts that follow the book were just not very interesting and the parts that diverged from the books stink. The incest overtones with a certain couple and then again in Hot shot were way more sick that sexy.
4,Fast Shipping!,"This product shipped fast, much to my delight. The product was as described, like new. A few of the plastic disc holders were a little beat up, but the discs still seemed in good shape."
5,true blood season 4,i love true blood. i pre-ordered it in april.it shipped fast.shipped on a tuesday and i had it by friday.
5,Quick take on #4,"These guys just keep getting betta ! Season 4 grabs you , shakes you up , & as you're tryin' to get it together it comes up from behind ! Then appears in front of you as it kicks you in the face !! I completely enjoyed every sec. of this experiance . Even having to say goodbye , shows you another path , in which to say hello ."
5,Awesome variation of the books,"The series is forever changing course! If you want to watch the book come to life, this isn't really it. It deviates drastically to make the series unique, then ventures back to the book story line. Outstanding performances by all the cast make you believe they are real!"
4,4th season lived up to my expectatins!,"I thought the 4th season was awesome! I really liked the ""war"" between the witches and vamps, and un ... how gorgeous is Alcide?! The 4th season certainly did not disappoint. Can't wait for Season Five."
4,Deviates a lot from the books,"I love the show, but I guess it disappoints me that it does continue to deviate substantially in many regards from the show. Nevertheless, it's extremely entertaining, and never were we promised the produces intended to follow the show exactly. Looking forward to the next season coming out!"
5,Love it!,I watched it while it played on HBO but needed it to go with the first three seasons..Wickedly good! :)
2,Poor quality Bluray,"So far, on just the third disc I have had problems with freezing and skipping on the first two discs but this one is the worst with all of the last episode madly out of sync. It's a very frustrating experience for such a good show to have been so poorly executed."
1,Just Plain Stupid Plots,"Yes, we all realize that this is a fantasy series. But in previous years there was some logic to how plot and sub-plots played out. This season the plots are not only absurd (even within the boundaries of fantasy) but stupid. The writers are definitely -- and deliberately -- appealing to the lowest IQ denominator in the viewing public. In the past, the dialog saved some of the absurdity of the plots, but this season the dialog could have been written by your local red neck 7th grade English class. Bad, really bad."
2,"Produce was ""not"" like new","I was really excited to purchase a ""like new"", but used DVD to save some money. On three of the five DVDs I had skipping for 30+ seconds. I was very disappointed. I read good reviews for this company, but my product was not up to par."
2,Very disappointing............,"I loved seasons one and two and three was ok, but this season was just plain awful! There are way too many characters and the story lines are becoming boring. I'm not going to purchase this season and I recommend you try to watch it before buying it, unless its cheaper to just buy, but don't get your hopes up. I'm not going to be tuning in to season five, I'm just going to start reading the books, because Alan Ball is screwing up this show."
2,Why can't they keep closer to the books?,"I do like the few things they kept in from the books, but a lot of the reason people tuned into this show in the first place is because the books had a loyal following. The first season has been the ONLY season to stick with the general plotline of the books. It really lets down fans who were tuning in for a specific storyline, only to get disappointed AGAIN. Too many time filling- non-relevant side-stories happening this season. They DID keep the Sookie-Eric storyline thank God! It is really disappointing how much creative license the writers at HBO take with this series. I've lost interest- but I'm still holding out for Game of Thrones. They better not screw that one up too. There is a reason the books were so popular"
2,Worst season,"Tris is definitely the worse season. I would say 2 or 3 episodes were ok, then horrible.I liked sookie and Eric romance. The end of the season was an embarrassment, I am sure many true blood fans like me were all disappointed. I certainly hope whoever wrote season 3 don't do it this time."
4,Pretty Good,"I'm sorry it took me so long to watch True Blood, I really enjoyed it a lot. Though it's not as good as The Vampire Diaries. The only thing I didn't like is when a story line /villian is featured throughout the entire season, it bores me. Other than that the show was pretty good. The actors were awesome. I highly recommend this show."
4,getting a little far from the book...,Not as true to the book as previous seasons but still entertaining. I love the books and it's always hard seeing the characters you enjoyed so much in the books doing something so different. However my husband knows nothing about the books and enjoys the show very much.
1,Throw in the kitchen sink too,"I loved True Blood 1st season. Second, third, fourth ... downhill. Now it has become a joke. Shifters, sliders, fairies, warewolfs, vampires, wierd cults, nonstop. Downright silly."
2,Boooo!,I wish I could've just rented instead of bought this. True Blood has really gone down since the first season.
5,Love it!,"Yep, we got sucked into this series. It's sort of a guilty fun, being that it is a bit of a vampire soap opera. But loved the reveal of what Sookie is!"
2,Season 4 & 5,I am not happy at all with the direction season four and five are going. It doesn't even seem like the same show anymore.
5,Question for y'all (warning: possible spoiler),"Season 4 showed up at my house today. The synopsis on the back says Bill is the new King of Mississippi. But I thought Bill was the King of Louisiana?Did anyone else notice that?I realize I'm probably making a mountain-out-of-a-molehill, but for some reason I find this very unsettling..."
5,Love this show,"Love this show. Period. I love the combo pack for the different ways you can view it. I don't have a blu-ray player at the moment but I plan on getting one in the future, so this is great because it has 3 different formats to watch the show in."
4,Lots of products for a good price,I picked this one because I liked all the options it included. The blu ray was great it also included the DVD copy and a code for a digital copy. I only wish that the DVD copy was more of a full set with episode description versus a booklet with 2 disks front and back.
5,"Excitement, this will be a classic","This season is a great as the ones before. The only thing I didn't like was that it ended too soon, I am really anxious to watch next season."
4,Best Season So Far,"I haven't much liked the earlier series. It is partly because of how little the series mirrors the books. After you get over that, there is still the frequency of scene changes to keep up with. Some bad script-writing.In series 4, it seems that Alan Ball may be trying to make up for some of his earlier mistakes by putting in more of the book content. Or maybe I just don't care anymore. I was disoriented for the first episodes. I couldn't tell what was in the book, and what was added. I gave up trying and allowed myself to enjoy the silliness.The lapsed memory of Eric and his love affair with Sookie are very smarmy. It's hard to carry off that part of the book, I'm sure. They didn't quite get it right. The Lafayette storyline is better now although he was killed off early in the book series.The witch theme was a good one!I enjoyed the series, and can't wait to see the next season."
2,HBO sure does love to charge a lot for such short seasons,"2 episodes per disc. This is silly, and really pricey when you divide out the number of episodes to discs to the price. Even with commentary and other bonus features at least 4 episodes should be able to fit on one disc. The season is great, but I can't justify buying it at that price."
2,Such a tease,Seemed great until I got to the last DVD with the last 2 episodes and it didn't play! What the heck I tried it on several different DVD players and it won't work!
4,True Blood #4,Very good conditionI enjoy this series very much and appreciate that I can get it at a reduced cost.
5,Amazing Value!!!!,When I saw the price for this product I had to jump on it. I love Trublood and I am so glad to have gotten when I did : )
5,Addicted to True Blood,"This season was the best yet! I can't wait for Season 5! You get to see SOO much more of the wolves and let me tell you, it's worth seeing!"
5,Fast shipment,"True Blood DVD set arrived quickly and well-packaged. Not too long after the order was placed, I received a $10 reimbursement on my CC due to the competition prices. Definitely would do business again. Thanks!"
3,loosing interest,"although I am happy about erics relationship with sooki, I do not like the direction bills character is taking. I will keep watching though, I want to know if he will redeem himself."
5,LOVE TRUE BLOOD,Typical HBO show as far as adult content.This show does not follow the Charlene Harris books but it is a good story. The fourth season was a good one.
5,Sexy Vamps,Who doesn't like vampires. Especially sexy vikings and civil war soldiers. Can't wait to see what happens next. Hope I can get every season
4,Weird but cool season!,"The True Blood story continues. I will not spoil it for anybody who hasn't seen it, so here it goes: Characters in the series change their behavior and act very different from what is known, which complicates many of the ongoing relationships between them. There are new characters that come in to make a mess of things and you'll just have to get this set to find out. It is very enjoyable TV viewing, although the gratutious nudity has been reduced from previous seasons."
5,Love this series......,"We do not get HBO, but I am hooked on this series. Deliciously sassy and totally entertaining to watch a rainy and snowy day."
3,Going Down Hill,In my humble opinion the True Blood series is going downhill with each new season. I might not buy season 5.
4,Love this series,"We love True Blood, even when it gets a bit weird. The show is very addictive and season 4 left me wanting season 5 to be available!!"
2,"Belt Clip flimsy, but...","Like others mention here, the clip broke off soon after I got it (snagged on the car door frame). However, I superglued one of those generic Swivel clip buttons on it, and used that happily for quite a while. The swivel action gave the case more ""give"" and made it more comfortable to wear.But I gave up on the case altogether. The Visor occasionally would pop out of the case. The new Targus case with a rotating (and very strong) belt clip it great. The stiff front and back protect the Visor, the velcro top hold the Visor inside, and the belt clip makes it very convenient. For my 2 worth, that's the best case going."
2,Comfortable / Not Very Sturdy,"I was pleased with the product for the one week that it lasted. I loved having the Visor with me and out of the way. Unfortunately, the Plastic belt clip is not very sturdy, and I snapped it off the 3rd or 4th time I sat in my SUV. The manufacturer will have to work out the kinks with the clip strength/durability before I repurchase.On the plus side, the holder was extremely comfortable and accessible for the short time that it lasted. I would not hesitate to recommend it for a doctor/dentist or other person who does not sit repeatedly during the course of their day. It might still break, but at least these people would see a cost/benefit over a more useful product life."
2,"Flimsy, at best","I purchased thinking it would withstand the day to day bumps that I normally go through. I broke the belt clip in a matter of about 5 days. It was almost a waste of money were it not for the convenience of the belt clip itself. Very useful, but quite flimsy."
2,Inferior Product,"For twenty bucks one would think that Handspring would have tested this product extensively to ensure that it actually worked well. However, due to the pour design of the piece of plastic that hooks on to your belt and the very week spring, the belt clip case is useless. Moreover, after falling once (while I was sitting -- so only about 2 1/2 ft to the floor) the spring and clip completely detached. I was able to use the product for about 6 days total. Great concept -- bad product, Handspring should look to Motorola's Cell Phone holders for a better design!"
3,"Fragile, but the best option out there.","Unlike the other reviewers, my holster lasted 6 months. The inability to find anything easier or faster to use, encouraged me to buy two units this time. I fear the possibility of using my pockets again."
2,I concur sir !,"Yes my Visor colleagues, as to most of you I agree. The clip has an average of 1.2 months of survival, and that's if you are careful. I really like the holster, but unfortunatly like most of you, as I was preparing to sit down in my car on the way to work the darn thing broke tumbling down hitting hard on the door frame and coming to a halt after a bounce or two landing on the concrete driveway. Lucky for me...it didn't get damage... Whew !! I plan on buying the Targus holster."
3,On further investigation...,"This is concerning my previous review. I've been using the case now for a month and have decided to stick with it (and raise my rating slightly). Though my initial gripes are still true, flimsy clip, little overall protection, and a tacky look with clear Visors, I have also noticed some virtues.The clip is placed at the top of the case, this was a very good idea, since it's very adjustable and feels confortable when sitting down. It's also very handy if you use your Visor often, compared to the fuss with opening cases. With this case you can just whip it out, and put it back with no fuss.Though still a little pricy considering what your getting, if you want fast access to your Visor and don't want to spent much, this looks to be your best bet."
4,Useful but probably not good for heavy-duty use,"I use the belt clip the way I see many people use pagers that have clips. I just put it in my front pants pocket, and slip the clip over the edge of my pocket.I agree it doesn't seem to be the most durable thing, and it's a shame the clip base doesn't swivel a bit. But I've found my Visor much handier to carry this way as I've already got too much junk in my shirt pocket. :)I also wish it covered the back of the Visor a bit. If you use a Visor module that has an obnoxious logo on it (most do) then if you use it on your belt it's sort of an ad to the whole world. Which is part of the reason I use it in my pants pocket instead."
2,I agree the belt clip stinks,I am on my second belt clip case. Handspring was great about replacing the first one. I just called them and told them I broke it and they sent me a new one. But less than a month later I just broke the second one. I like the concept so much though I went out and bought a universal cell phone belt clip and attached it to the back of the case (minus the original belt clip)and it works great. If Handspring could improve the belt clip design this would be a great case.
2,Almost a great design,"I was so pleased with this case for the first several days. It's so much more handy than the lid that comes with the visor. Unfortunately, I had the same problem so many other have had -- the belt clip broke off. The case itself is solid, but the hinge is sadly flimsy. I fixed mine by drilling a hole through the hinge and putting a paper clip through it (typical nerd thing to do), but I think the plastic around that is giving out, too.My only other (minor) complaint is that, when I don't have the case clipped to my belt, I have to hold it because the visor won't go into it backwards to expose the face. That would have been a simple and helpful design improvement."
3,Terrific...if only it lasted,"As a medical professional, I use my Visor many times a day. So getting the belt clip was a dream come true. It worked perfectly. I was able to grab my Visor immediately, use it, and put it back in it's holder with great speed and ease. Unlike in some of the other reviews, mine belt clip lasted about 4 months. Then, out of nowhere, the clip broke off. I had noticed the spring getting a bit looser over the prior month, but thought nothing of it. If the product lasted longer, I would give it an enthusiastic 5 stars. For those who don't mind spending ... every 4 months, this is the product for you."
3,Great idea but poor quality clip,"I love the idea... very easy to access, protects the screen. But the belt clip broke when I sat down in a chair less than a month after I purchased it. For $20.00 it could be alot more rugged and durable."
4,So far so good...........,"Unlike the people who have previously rated this item, my belt clip did not break on me(yet, knock on wood). I purchased this belt clip the same time that I purchased my Visor Platinum, as I am getting ready to purchase my VisorPhone soon. This VisorClip is very handy with my MiniJam, as I can slip my Visor in there with the MiniJam loaded, and I can listen to music for a couple of hours.The one reason I did not rate the VisorClip with 5 stars is because the belt clip is not the best of quality. You would expect more from a company that makes the Handspring, as the quality is similar to a Chinese/Taiwan made knock-off.I'm hoping Handspring will realize that their belt-clip is very flimsy(I'm very afraid of it breaking off) while I'm riding my moped, etc."
2,Weak clip breaks easily!,"Belt clip is weak and broke after I had it for only 1.5 months! Clip spring is so weak, that sometimes it falls off my belt! This is a very poor product from a company that we've come to expect to be an innovator."
2,"Good concept, poor quality",I also am on my second unit. The first one's clip snapped off when I was getting out of a car. I love the easy access it provides to your handspring. I just wish it was built more durable. I would pay double if I new it would last. A couple of times my handsping has popped out as I have been lifting my brief case on to my shoulder. It would be nice if it was held more securely in the clip. Use with caution.
1,Don't bother,"I definitely wanted some sort of means to hold my Visor Deluxe on my belt, as I have few shirts with pockets and don't like to carry anything that (relatively) large in my pants pockets. So, decided to order this case when I also ordered the Visor Deluxe.So, the first time I sat down with this case on my belt, the clip came apart, causing the case to drop to the ground with the Visor Deluxe in it (no damage to the Visor Deluxe, thank goodness!) and I was unable to reassemble the clip."
2,Almost causes more harm than good,"Perhaps I'm spoiled by having had a spif leather case with a detachable belt hook for my Palm VII, but this overpriced belt clip is embarassing.Fortunately, I don't use it very often. It is so tight fitting, that it is difficult to remove the Handspring without removing the holster from your belt. Even worse, it is wearing grooves into the side of my Handspring.It is difficult to envision this ...plastic device lasting for very long. It is better than nothing, but that isn't saying much."
5,If only school were this much fun,"Although I am somewhat older than the suggested age range for this book, I loved the combination of witty illustrations and sly humor. Kalman's imagination is free-wheeling and far-reaching (have YOU ever considered what you'd do if your dog swallowed the remote?) and in a few words she encapsulates the essence of the educational experience--long stretches of boredom punctuated by occasional moments of terror.The read-aloud length is ten minutes (fifteen if you're laughing really hard), just about perfect for children with short attention spans and their weary parents. The pop quiz at the end is worth the price of admission. Did I mention that all the characters have wonderfully creative names (and nicknames) and that the principal's bird realizes that he has a birdbrain? This was our first venture into Kalman territory, just enough to whet the appetite and make me eager to read the rest of her work."
5,clever and hilarious,"i love this book. it kind of reminds me of j.otto siebold in style, which i also love. it's the kind of book a parent can actually read to a child over and over again. there is always something new to see, hidden on the page to discover. and it is really funny and original. maira kalman's illustrations are to die for. a little primitive in a very sophisticated way. did i mention i love this book? i love this book!!"
3,Lasted Three Years Until Power Cord Snapped,"I gave this Solia flat iron to my wife for Xmas in 2009. It stopped working yesterday.She loved it while she was able to use it, but the right angle, power cord strain relief did not protect the inner electrical wires from breaking after 1000 days of daily service and storage. It might still be alive if it was never wrapped up and put away after each use...I may be able to take it apart and solder the fragile wires back together, but we'll probably just be safe and buy another one.Three stars for three years of satisfactory performance."
2,Didn't last,"I purchased this flat iron 2 years ago. It worked great, smooth even heat, didn't catch my hair, and my hair looked beautiful. Only problem, which is a BIG one, it quit working 2 days after my warranty ran out. Hmmmm, I'll call that fishy. This product worked great while it lasted, but it doesn't have a long life. I won't be purchasing one again. I'll be going back to corioliss, it lasted 8 years before I had to replace it."
2,not too cool,Was not impressed with this iron at all. The temp gauge is done in white on a pink background so it's very hard to read.Turned very low and it still fried the ends of my hair. The surface is not as smooth as other ceramic irons and it just didn'tlive up to the hype.
3,OK,"I found nothing special about this flat iron. I have had many through the years, and this one is average at best. I have been using one with longer plates which may be the issue. I ended up returning the item."
1,Avoid this book!,"To say I'm disappointed by this book is an understatement. It's obvious the publisher and author were using JBuilder beta code when writing this book. Few of the examples work without some rewriting, and code that does work uses Java 1.0x code and techniques. The example figures in the book are different from the release version of Jbuilder and several of the functions used in examples have been deprecated and replaced with new functions."
1,Database in Java? Stay away from this one!,"If you ignore the minor errors, such as having used for his book a different version of JBuilder than is now shipping, and if you further ignore the superficial coverage of UI building to which this text is limited, you still run straight up against a fat lie.The cover of the book conspicuously promises that it ""Includes database connectivity"". This may be true of JBuilder, but it is wholly and irredeemably untrue of Mr Holzner's book. In fact, the word, ""database"", does not even appear once in the entire book.Since many of Borland's JBuilder customers will have opted for this product precisely because of its database connectivity features, they would be well advised not to expect much of anything from this book."
5,Riveting!,"Fascinating, well done and utterly heartwrenching chronicle of the genocide in Rwanda. An extraordinarily well-done documentary!"
4,Informative but US centered,"Very interesting documentary film but somehow too focused on the role of the US in the non-intervention in Rwanda. The same account of Belgium and France's roles would have made the movie more balanced internationally and more accurate.However the interviews of the actors in the genocide are very powerfull, especially of Kofi Annan, Madeleine Albright and Phillipe Gaillard (International Committee of the Red Cross).A must see to get the background picture of the genocide. A good starter before watching Hotel Rwanda or Sometimes in April."
2,Good but not great,"Factual, but slow moving documentary on one of the worst, and most savage genocides in history.Seemed to focus a lot on interviews, which is ok, but many were not that insightful or providing attention to detail.Certainly could have been better, and provided more chronology of events, as well as what motivated the Hutu extremists - who showed they are a lower form of life than a prion - the causative agent in Mad Cow Disease - and currently the lowest form of life known to man."
1,Drone,"Kind of drony from song to song, could'nt really distinguish one track from another. Tony , the lead guitarist is okay, but his blues riffs all sound like rehashed efforts. The drummer seems limited on his approach to the instrument. Stacy Lip, the vocalist puts forth a valiant yet less than entertaining effort. She doesn't seem to be able to sing in key without (slipping) out. Hey, it's your money until you transfer it for the product!"
2,Weakest in Series by Far,"Not completely terrible, some laughs are in there but overall it is MUCH less funny than any of the previous books in the series (of which I own and love all). Some really lame and cliche jokes appear in this one. It lacks the cleverness of the the writing in the others and has crazy things happen for the sake of crazy things happening without being very funny about them.Skip this one, wait to see if they get back in their groove."
5,One ton Chevy,"I replaced a stock pair of lockouts on a Chevy one ton truck.One thing these are heavier than the stockers, less plastic parts also.They replaced the old ones perfectly, great product!"
1,"directions generic for all trucks,warn didn't answer email for help","Hub wont fit my truck,(2003 F250 Ford Superduty) or at least I can't figure it out. This is not my 1st mechanic project, and I'm not a dummy. The directions are generic for all applications. I emailed Warn a couple weeks ago for help....never got a reply."
1,Stuck again!!!,The second set of hubs to leave use stranded! Top of the line. LOL! I give up on Warn do to this!
2,warn 38826 premium manual hub,one of the springs was not attached the lock-out would'nt disengauge for somthing this expensive you would think it would be right.
4,better and cheaper than originals,"Great product. Half the price of the OEM through Ford, easy to install, and more reliable. Only thing I wish they would change would be the way it gets turned. Can be hard to grab especially with gloves on in the winter. I think some options for colors for the turn thing could be a hit to. Could almost act as an accessory"
3,"OK, but not what I expected","This will probably turn out to be a useful addition to my camera bag, though it wasn't what I expected. The illustration suggests that it's a graded filter. It's not. It's exactly half gray and half clear, so perfect alignment with the horizon will be absolutely critical - sometimes a hard thing to do when taking nature shots. Both sides of the filter were also dirty, took several cleanings with lens cleaner fluid, and still have a thin foggy ring along the outer edge. Since I bought an oversized filter and step up ringTiffen 4952SUR 49 to 52 Step Up Filter Ring (Black), that shouldn't be a problem for me, but it might be for some users."
5,A must have,"The more I brief, the faster I write. This has been a huge asset in my studies. My speed is increasing as I incorporate more briefs rom this book"
4,Brief Encounters,"Although I just started using it, I'm carrying it with me everywhere. The briefs are simple and easy to remember. Best investment I ever made."
5,writer,This book has helped me so much with my writing.Great book.The great price really helped a lot also.
5,Must Have!!!,"After reading the various comments regarding this book, I was beyond excited when UPS delivered my book today. First, EVERY student should add this as one of their reference books as soon as possible. Second, being able to learn outlines that cause hesitation early on will make such a BIG difference. Third, eliminating multi-stroked outlines down to one or two strokes is invaluable. Talk about building your speed!!! I love, love, love this book. I've already eliminated several hesitation outlines that I've struggling with. Thank you so much!!!!"
2,"""Hit"" is a subjective term","This 2 disc set includes songs spanning from the '50s to the '90s, and after listening to the online clips I thought I recognized some good music that I might have forgotten about even though I didn't recognize most of the song titles on disc 2. WRONG! Disc 1 has the only songs worthy of any substantive ""hit"" status - Get A Job, Kansas City, In The Year 2525, Life Is A Rock; two classic ""rock"" instrumentals: The Happy Organ, Sleepwalk; the weirdly interesting The Rapper & Troglodyte. Disc 2 is just forgettable and faddish sounding. The last four songs are '90s street sounding hip-hop with lyrics that barely escape the ""explicit"" label. Separately, I would give disc 1 four stars and disc 2 one star."
4,A fun album...,"I bought this album a long time ago on vinyl, and while it's not exactly a 'must have' (except for Poco fans, of course), it's always a good album to play.For the most part, it's a collection of jangly, upbeat, country-rock type of music, alternating between songs written by Paul Cotton and Rusty Young. ""Shoot For The Moon"" was the single, and it's got Rusty's patented ballad style and rough crooning voice all over it. If only it wasn't so short.The title track is the most impressive song on the album, however. ""Ghost Town"" is a powerful, intense track with a haunting sound and lyrics and a good metaphor for lost love. This song alone is practically worth buying the album for (along with the cover art, which captures the same mood).Still, an overall enjoyable collection of songs, and well-worth getting, even if you're not a Poco fan."
5,One Of The Best,"This is Get Rich Or Die Trying before 50 Cent. Big Love puts the street life down plain and simple. Songs like ""Everyday"" show he can spit with the finest. I found his new site www.candysto.com It has good news and info. on Big Love"
4,Big Love One Of Raps's Finest,"This is a complete album from top to bottom! Big Love's street credibility is unquestioned. Every woman in the world will feel his verse on, ""What A Playa Wont Do"". Every song on the album will reach someone. If this is his freshman effort I can't wait to hear him even more polished. Can be compared to the greatest (Tupac, Eminem, Biggie, LL) with an ever better upside."
4,"Maryland : A Middle Temperament, 1634-1980",This is a great survey book for anyone interested in learning about Maryland's history. It touches on all the major themes in the great state's history and how they related to the national landscape.
4,"Great, for a time",Back in the day it was a great card... now most cable companies have moved over to DTV and have limited the number of analog channels... as a result this card grows increasingly less useful.
1,Bad service from Amazon.com,"I bought 2 of these. Amazon sent me one defective one. I had to send it back for a refund. Amazon charged me 50% of the shipping cost, calling it ""non-refundable promotion deduction"". I thought such practice is absolutely outrageous. Good luck to you if you were to purchase anything from Amazon.com. If you are unlucky to have a defective item sent to you, you'll have to foot half the shipping cost of shipment. Good luck..........."
4,Awesome!!!,"In one word...it's an awesome drive. I like the size and the speed. The only thing i do not like about this drive is the flimsy skins that come with it. It's all too easy to lose the caps that go with these. Better if they were made with the plastic cap and sleeve as shown in the pic above.Apart from that, it's a great product...one that I've repeated twice. Definitely a good purchase!"
2,Better Not to Buy,"I'm the consumer of SanDisk USB flash drives. I have used couple of sandisk flash drives (i.e. 512MB Mini, 256MB Mini) before I bought this product.Performance wise this particular product is not doing good. It's taking long time to copy files from my computers. Even it's taking long time to delete files from this disk. So I returned to Amazon and looking for Mini products from SanDisk.I doubt all the Micro products which is having capacity more than 512MB. Now I'm planning to buy 512MB or 1GB SanDisk Mini USB flash drive.Better buy some good one than wasting your time on this product."
1,"Great form factor, but dead slow.","I wanted to replace a Lexar 1GB with this, but I'll keep looking. I used it to transfer a 700MB, 2300 file My Documents folder to a new PC. The transfer seemed pretty slow, but deleting those files from the Sandisk took *61* minutes! Back it goes."
4,Very small .. slow only when writing a group of small files,"I like the size. The speed on reading and writing is usually just fine, but when writing a group of small files it takes ages."
1,"Slow, slow and SLOW!","Do NOT buy this product. It is incredibly slow, by far the slowest USB drive out of the dozen or so that I've used. It handles small numbers of large files rather well but it immediately chokes whenever faced with a large quantity of small files. I attempted to copy ~50MB (1500 files, 800 directories) to the disk and it took almost 30 minutes to complete the copy! That's roughly 27K/second. Deleting the files was painful as well, taking at least 15 minutes to delete everything. For kicks, I popped in an old 128 MB Kingston drive and was able to copy the same set of files to it in under 30 seconds and the delete took under 15 seconds. Bottom line is don't be fooled by the drive's small physical size, large capacity and price point: it simply doesn't perform."
1,"SanDiskPOORcustomerService, Falls Apart, Crashes, Piece of Junk","This thing fell apart after 6-months. Tried to exchange it with SanDisk and it became an administrative and time nightmare. It crashed ALL THE TIME, wiping your data.DO NOT BUY SanDisk products as they make it VERY DIFFICULT TO GET AN EXCHANGE ON A BAD UNIT. They should have just sent a new one with proof of purchase and enclosed a return envelope so you could return the old one and they could analyze why their products are so bad."
1,DONT NOT BUY FROM THEM VIRUS,"I REPEAT, DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PLACE.They install a Trojan hidden in this sandisk 2gb.I bought this for my grandson and he used it on my vista computer. first time plugging it in, the thing would say win32x has stopped working. Thinking it was something wrong with my brand new computer. he continued to us it for his school work and photos from computer to computer. mined locked up had to reformat. nothing on it but a few photos and papers. he went next door, to show his work to his friends. Then to his other friend so on so forth and the funny thing is if they had window XP their computer would lock up in the matter of seconds. come to find out its the drive. so for the fact they where so cheap i bought one more just smaller. and low and be hold. the same problem not even having nothing on it. straight out the box. im going to request my money back."
1,Terrible... want to throw it in the trash,"But I won't because I paid good money for it. As you can see from the other reviews, the speed on this thing is pathetic, almost to the point of non-functional when it comes to many small files. I had a small game on the drive, but it has tons of small files in the folder. It took over 10 minutes to delete a 10 mb folder... makes you wonder if SanDisk spent 10 minutes to test this thing. Stay away.. or if you really want one, buy mine please."
1,A dead tortoise is faster,"I just got this dog so that I can backup data from work. I plugged it into the same USB port that I normally use for backing up to my Lexar 1gb flash drive and tried to copy a directory/folder that takes 4 minutes to copy to my Lexar. 143 minutes estimated time!!!! What the heck????? And it's taking every second of it, too! They say this thing is USB 2.0 compliant, but I don't believe it. It's the slowest flash drive I've ever used. EVER.Stay away. Stay far, far away."
1,poor speed...or only a rare case?,"about 8 times slower than my former 512M drive(also sandisk product)!!!!for equality, I format these 2 drives to FAT32, and copy the same folder with some course documents and some small portable software inside. The 512M one finishs in 5 minutes, while the new one is still copying after 20mintues!!! and only 46%!!!I've use it for 2 weeks and can't bare it any more!!!"
1,Stay away from this one!!!!!,"I bought this flash drive like a month ago and it stopped working just like that! One day I plugged it in a portatil hp pc and windows explorer didn?t respond. It?s a XP sp2.I unplugged it and tried again with the same result, the same with the regular pc?s where I usually use this flash drive. Bottom line: money wasted.Being a regular costumer of sandisk, I must say im very dissapointed. The must frustating thing is that I wont get a refund because the 30 days expired.Besides, it comes with a cheap cover instead of the regular one (the 512 micro flash drive).So, try some other product."
5,thumb drive,"great product. use it and others all the time. pix, music, file transfers. Super easy to use."
3,Like it,"I looove the looks of this set, but have a heck of a time placing the plug in the bottom of the salt shaker so it will stay. As a matter of fact, I took the set to the dinner table tonight to find that the salt shaker was empty, and later found the plug and salt on the kitchen counter. This is the only time it has actually dislodged itself, and I have no way of knowing if it will happen again. On the other hand, my daughter has the same set and I've heard no complaints from her. Regardless, the design could use some additional engineering. Even considering the negative, the set looks so good that I'm considering buying another set so I have matching shakers. At this point it's a wait and see..."
2,Not practical,"I bought a few of these clip on visor, the UV sheaths are simply too long and provide a claustrophobic feel. They don't provide good visibility due to inner reflection (you see the reflection of your nose and mouth ), they also easily get scratched."
3,A good survey but not enough detail,"It is well written and informative, but reads more like a survey than a biography. It almost seems as if the book is written for journalists who need a crash course on Tito and some background information before they are shipped off to the Balkans to cover the latest mishaps of that region. Thus, the biography seems to short and feels lacking of details that would make the interpretation and understanding of certain events clearer. For example, more background and detail should have been put into Tito's relationships and subsequent breaks with Djilas and Rankovic or the purges of Inform Biro (Comintern) supporters after the break with Stalin. I also found the World War II chapters confusing and lacking in the explanation of the partisan and chetnik struggles against Germans, and their subsequent rivalry. From the limited information provided one is almost lured into viewing these two groups as two big groups caught into the 1940's version of a gang war."
1,They need a negative number of stars for this,"Purchased for my Tablet PC. Worked great for about two weeks, then suddenly had problems accessing any discs. Went through the hassle of getting an RMA from Buslink, within a week they had a replacement. This one worked fine for about two months, then it started doing the exact same thing the first one did. Dumped it for a Sony model that's been trouble free so far."
2,Not as described,"This product definitely does not have a holster. If that's why you're buying this one, think twice. Otherwise. Great flashlight!"
5,very bright light,"Super bright and built like a tank,very compact. As bright as a much larger 4 cell mag light and the size of the smallest double AA flashlight"
3,Okay flashlight,"I wasn't that impressed with the brightness of this light. It's about as bright as the 9-LED flashlight that sells for ~$5. The other feature I don't like is the switch. You have to unscrew the battery cap to turn it off, screw it in to turn it on, and at half-way, you can press the cap to get it to go on. This seems more annoying than anything and if I had known this fact earlier, I definately wouldn't have bought it.The good points are that it is very small and very thin, and it is fairly bright for it's size."
4,nice,"Nice and compact, can take with me anywhere. Love the LED because its very bright. Big things come in little packages with this flashlight."
4,Bright little light,"The flashlight itself is excellent-very bright, and very well constructed. If you use the light a lot, it's best to buy rechargeable batteries and a charger for it, as a few sets of regular CR123 batteries it uses can end up costing as much as the flashlight itself. The only reason I didn't give this light 5 stars is because of the bizarre strap that comes with it. The strap doesn't fit through the hole at the end of the flashlight, and appears to have been made for something else. It has 2 loops, one small and thin, and one large, which you can fit your hand through. The only way to connect the strap to the light, is to thread the small thin strap through the hole, which isn't very secure, as the thin strap could easily break. But, all in all, a very good flashlight."
4,Its a bible,"Indeed a marvelous tool, if you know where to look for something specific. Can get a bit technical for me. But great resource."
5,A Timeless Toy,"I originally purchased this Tupperware Toy Ball for all my kids decades ago and was extremely pleased to learn that it was still available when I began having Grandchildren. It has a unique appeal, and rates well above all the similar types of toys that have come out over the years. Kids crawl to it before they can walk; they learn their three basic colors, shapes, and coordination. They build muscles when they learn to open it up. They learn to stack the pieces. Best of all, then can amuse themselves with it as well for several years!"
4,Defective Shape O Ball,"The mechanism (an elastic band) that holds the two sides together and expands to allow the shapes to drop out was defective. It didn't have enough ""give"" and eventually broke. We are returning this item."
3,Very Disappointing Packaging,So I order this toy since all the educational value but to my disappoint and surprised the way it was shipped with no box. Just multiple layers of plastic wrap around it. see [...] Would have been nice if they stated that it came with no box somewhere in the description. Can't exactly give someone a gift with packaging like this.
5,Ball of Joy!,I remembered this as a cherished toy of my son and I wanted to give that same joy to my grand niece.
1,"great toy, ridiculous price","My niece had this toy 30 years ago, and now I wanted to buy one for her young son. It is a great toy... very basic, teaches shapes, durable, not high tech...all good things. However, they are out of their minds if they think I am paying $35 for it. Just a disgusting rip off for what is ultimately a piece of plastic that likely costs them a dollar to make. I am not one to skimp on kids' presents; far from it. But I draw the line at this poor value, hence the one star overall rating."
2,Broke apart on first use.,"The yellow handles pull apart to get at the shapes inside. I gave it as a gift, and the first time we pulled it apart to get the shapes out, the cord that hooks the two sides together came off the hook, so for all intents and purposes it is broken, as we do not have a tool for reconnecting the cord. 40 Years ago when my son was a child every mom I knew had one of these for their kids. I never knew of one breaking before. I don't know if it is made differently now, or what. But, it used to be a great toy -- 40 years ago."
5,CLASSIC!,We love this toy. A great educational classic!Had to get one as I remember having one exactly like this when I was a child.
4,This is nostalgia.,"My parents bought this for me when I was a kid and I watched my younger siblings play with it after me. I will be buying one for my best friend (who is pregnant). We had it sitting in our basement until the day we moved. It was a great toy and just looking at it makes me smile (but I am a rather emotional little chit). I am hoping that by the time I want to have kids (if I ever do) I'll be able to yoink it from the bestie - chances are she'll be done when I'm just beginning - but if not, I'll just buy my own. The shapes are just as fun to try to stack as they are to put in the ball, and the challenge of shaking the pieces out of the ball is probably equally as challenging as putting them in there."
5,Different shape sorter - love it,"We received this Shape O Ball toy used from a neighbor. My son loved it immediately. My son likes anything ball shape and I think this got his attention. Before, we had the Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics Baby's First Blocks (similar idea) but my son barely touched it. The Shape O Ballis challenging enough for him to find the shapes. More shape variety than other similar toys. He likes turning the ball to find the right shapes and then shaking the shapes out of the ball to start all over again. I would recommend this for my friends. He is 3 years old now and still likes it."
5,50 Years Of Singing 1948 - 1998,A delightful set of Israeli songs. Many that I have not heard before but a really nice selection to listen to.
3,"Fascinating, but dry","I picked up this book as research for a project I'm working on, and it is pretty fascinating. How far back the creation of life-approximating automata goes is very interesting. The writing is pretty dry, however, and this is my only real criticism of the book. Wood goes pretty deep into what I would consider minutiae, and, while I can see that this would be useful for some scholars, I found it to be a bit much. Still, the subject matter is great and I would be hard-pressed to find another book that so thoroughly covers the matter. I applaud Wood for the historian she is, yet find it unfortunate that her writing style marks her as one."
1,This is probably the worst book..,"...i have ever read.Ms. Wood, with her new-labour, right-on attitude, has not the faintest idea how to relate anything in its proper historical context.Snide, completely unnecessesary, asides belittling some of the most original thinkers of the past, only serve to highlight the author's ignorance."
4,tv stand,The TV stand arrived quickly and was exactly as it was pictured. The assembly was easy. and the stand was sturdy and exactly what I had ordered.
3,Still waiting for effect,"It has only been a month since I started using this product, hoping for fewer/less intense hot flashes. At this point, nothing to report. I'll give it another few weeks I guess before I give up. It is pleasant enough to use - not greasy, absorbs quickly. But too expensive to use for skin cream."
5,Outstanding,Professor Bonser wrote an outstanding textbook for introductory public affairs classes with Professors McGregor and Oster. This book has chapters for many issues so the instructor can better supplement lecture with readings. I recommend this book in no uncertain terms!
4,Photo looks better than it really is.,"The legs on the photo are a lot beefier than the ones that come with it. They are much thinner and are not as strong. The tools in the picture are shown as hung on a peg board. The hooks are not included, I had to buy them at Home Depot."
4,Redi Tile replacement stainer,Redi Tile replacement strainer is hard to find in Home Depot or Lowes and was about double the price from Redi Tile.
4,Great but not Perfect!,"First it's a good product and the strainer is perfect. However the screws that come with the strainer are painted black and do not match the oil rubbed bronze look. If you can get past this, then this drain cover is for you."
3,Does Not Feel Sincere,"The material on this CD is good however, the singer, Judy, is not at all convincing. The vocal performance feels stiff, forced and not very sincere. I will give her an A for effort but this sounds like an opera singer who is singing for adults and looking down upon children. There is nothing friendly about her approach except for her good choice of songs. I think Judy Caplan Ginsburgh would make a good record maker for someone who could sing these songs in a tender like way. As I said, she should get an A for effort because she has chosen good songs, though she is not the one who should sing them."
5,Great Buy,Warm and comfortable. Already had gotten some previously as a gift 2 years ago. Recommend highly for really cold days.
5,"Soft, Warm and Wonderful!!",I got this for winter in Utah to keep warm. I also got some other brands at the same time. This was by far the most suitable for me because it is lightweight yet warm and doesn't make my overly sensitive skin itch. I would order more in a heartbeat if I moved back to Utah. Love it!!
5,A Scholarly yet Provacative Work,A must have for all those interested in the culture of the fin-de-siecle as well as turn-of-the-century modernism.
2,More Mansion Than Cottage,"The title of this publication is a little misleading. While it displays elevation and perspective views of many buildings along with their floor plans, the vast majority of those buildings are of the larger, mansion variety, and not the smaller cottages it refers to in its title. It is very lean in detail drawings along with descriptions, and is non-existent when it comes to sectional views. It will not help you when it comes to information on how to build one of these plans, but it will tell you what it will look like when you are done."
1,Major Disappointment,"I've been a ""connoisseur"" of dark-chocolate-dipped apricots for years and this is the first time I've ordered them from Amazon.This brand, Old Naples, was a real disappointment.The apricots have an artificial flavor, a strong aftertaste, and a stale, jelly-like texture. It was not at all the melt-in-your mouth, sticky-sweetness that I have experienced from other brands.The chocolate layer is thin but more importantly, it's cheap chocolate. It's a waxy, flavorless, too-sweet chocolate that barely even looks like dark rather than milk chocolate.On the positive side, each one was individually sealed in cellophane so they weren't as messy as I expected, and the simple gold box was attractive.I would not order these again."
4,chocolate glazed apricots,Delicious but messy; chocolate mostly off apricots but still very tasty; package must have gone through a tumbling dryer; apricots still out of this world
3,BLEH,"I was hoping to love these. Wanted to send as a gift, but wanted to test them out first. They had an odd aftertaste. They also were not nearly as good as juicy/moist as they should have been. Sorry. Won't be ordering them again. Also-this item is pricey. I'm happy to pay more for a good product. Annoyed when I pay this much and don't love them."
5,BombPianist,Patric is a DYNAMITE pianist. One of the truly artistic composers of the new era. Can't wait for his next release.
3,"Tremendous resource, poorly written","This is indeed, like the other reviewers have stated, the most complete foray into the subject matter to date. It's too bad that the author's abilities at unearthing such treasures were not matched by a very readable writting style. Five stars for effort and material and one star for readability equals a three star rating."
3,"good idea, but needs some work","Great combination of a knife and beaner, however the knife does not lock down as well as one would like-makes it unsafe if the knife creeps open and you don't know it, and the gate on the beaner has longer threads than necessary(it is non-load bearing, so what's the point) and the gate itself doesn't open very far.Knife was sharp and useful and the combination of the products is a useful idea."
1,Poor product,"the screwdriver blades do not lock in either position and therefore catch your clothes or fold in when you try to use them. the knife blade is very sharp and does lock open but is does not lock close. it can open 1/2"" without you pulling on it. avoid this product."
3,I'm on the fence.,"I like the Carabiner as a whole. Knife is is pretty good, but I don't know if you would be able to put a lot of force against it. But it does the job. What I don't like is the Phillips head screw driver. It is a #1 type head. Most common Phillips screws you will come across are #2 so it is pretty much worthless to useless to me."
2,Great till it falls apart...,"This product grabbed my attention the second I saw it: a carbiner for my keys, a bottle opener, a pocket knife, and some screwdrivers! In concept, it covered my needs in most situations. The locking knife didn't lock in the open or closed position, but it wasn't a dealbreaker. Until...Well, the Allen screws that hold its sandwich of four metal layers started loosening and even falling out from just daily handling. The screwdriver tools now flop about, and now I have to inspect this product every day I use it to see which screws have loosened. For several months, I put it away in a drawer out of disappointment.Kershaw has a lifetime warranty on its products, so I'm going to see if they honor a replacement or swapping for an item of similar value. I still love the concept, but the Allen screws are the weak links in the product. Not recommended."
2,it looks good but,the kershaw carrabiner looks good but the knife is not that sharp and it would be nice if it was a smaller size
3,flimsy lock,"not a bad tool, but the lock doesn't hold... pretty dangerous. certainly wouldn't give it to a young boy. sharp blade. overall a good tool."
4,Good deal,"Really wicked amp for the price, great sound but it runs a little warm so I don't stack anything on it that doesn't provide space between for air circulation. I paired this amp with a set of Reference audio R82T floor model speakers, cranked up the Sepultura and now my neighbours have a reason to officially hate me.Loud and clear."
4,Quality and inexpensive,"Super unit for the price - unless you are pushing it out through $3,000.00 speakers, you will never outclass it for value. I use it primarily for my home theatre in my living room, but almost as much to play music through.Bottom line - good unit for a great price."
2,Shattered Hopes!,"I was so excited to find this item online because Apple flavor is my favorite, next to watermelon and you can never find them in the store her in MA unless you buy them in a variety pack and even then they are the small version. Unfortunately, when I received them and every individually wrapped ""stix"" was shattered like glass. I had read the reviews and a couple of them said the same, but I had hoped the seller had learned to package them better... NOPE! Very disappointing!"
1,Arrived poorly,"Box is bent and all of the sticks are stuck together. This is gift, I won't be giving this the way it is. Please let me know if there is anything I can do?"
2,Pretty Disappointing,"I finished this book, but afterwards I have to wonder why. The characters were trite, the plot was juvenile, and the science in the science fiction was ludicrous. I hadn't had much experience with Zahn and I could forgive him for joining in writing the Star Wars crap (which along with Star Trek is ruining the SF genre), He seems to be a decent writer with some skill, but this was embarassing. If you want to read some real SF then try some of the British writers like Banks and Hamiliton."
3,Disappointed they are Ceramic,"I am also disappointed these are ceramic and not the same material that the plated and bowls are made of. There is no where in the website description of the material they are made from. I just received these as a bridal shower gift, and one of them was shattered. I have not started using them yet, but I can imagine that if one is already broken before use, the others probably won't last long either. Cute product but should have been made from the classic corelle tempered glass."
2,I don't receive now I do,"I bought this item together with dinner set pretty pink and camellia, but unfortunately I don't receive the 7 oz Ramekin, set of 2, pretty pink until now.Hi, thank you amazon.com, I just received my set yesterday. It is a very nice Ramekin. The only thing is that it is made of porcelain and Made in Thailand."
4,Good How-to on raising beef on shoestring for direct market,"Joel Salatin brings optimism and energy to this series of essays on how he raises beef (and other livestock ) on grass for direct market to urban consumers. He reveals his tricks in great detail, such as the egg-mobile, the pig-aerator, electric fencing, the warm winter hay shed, and how to promote the meat. A must for anyone looking for new ideas on raising livestock"
3,Good for what it is,"The portfolios got to me very quickly and in great shape. The only thing I didn't like is that in the item description it does not mention what material the portfolio is made of-- I assumed leather or something similar as opposed to the thin plastic and although it is useable for what I need, I would not have chosen it had I known what the outside was made out of."
5,itoya portfolio,"This acid free portfolio is nice as a comparison book for different papers, which is what I am using it for. It is also nice to put together images for clients or a portfolio in general, without worry for degradation of images solely based on how they are stored."
4,Awesome Track,"It's one of the best tracks off their new CD. ""I Miss You"" features a fantastic acoustic sound, and the lyrics are among Blink's best as artists. My lone gripe is that the finale essentially repeats the chorus from earlier, and doesn't really build to anything amazing. Still, it's catchy, it's deeper than you'd expect. This is modern punk you shouldn't feel ashamed of loving."
2,not worth it,"This cd isnt really worth it , you basicly play all that money for one song:1/ I miss you2/ Not now3/ Feeling this (video)"
4,Great Expectations,Product arrived as advertised - best production of Great Expectations I've seen - highly recommend whether you've read the book or not
3,Lighting and scenery too dark,The movie itself was great except for the grayness of the scenery. It put me in a bad mood while I watched it. Very depressing.
5,Let's get this average rating up!,"I feel obliged to write in briefly with a 5 star review, to boost the average rating so that no-one will see the 3-star average and pass on this marvellous performance and recording. We should be at a little over 4 by now...I agree with everything that Scott Morrison has said. I thought that Julia Fischer's performance of my favourite violin concerto (well...it's this or Sibelius. Or Shostakovich's First...) was as good as Viktoria Mullova's and (though I hate to say it) better than Anne-Sophie Mutter's live version, while the orchestral accompaniment was even more splendid than Seiji Ozawa's. The extra pieces are also well worth hearing.Hugely recommended."
5,A superb reading of the Tchaikovsky,This is an oustanding disc by the brilliant young violinist Julia Fischer. Her technique and tonal colouring are impeccable. As I mentioned in the Mozart review she has now moved on from Pentatone and is in the Decca stable of brilliant female violinists.
3,A little Sleepy,"Sorry, Fischer is a good violinst, but this record is somewhat of a snoozer. Partly because of the recorded sound."
3,drove threw the moutains with this,"works, but is super loud. Sucks when you got toddlers in the car, and cant hear them beacuse of the noise. Anyways, I drove threw the moutains with this and my board did not fall off, so I was a happy mom."
3,"Cheap, easy, durable, but mods needed","I've used these on two cars. On the first car, an ancient Volvo, these worked absolutely perfectly. The straps are a bit long which can make it a bit annoying and time-intensive to put everything together, but once they're on, the buckles stay tight, the extra side flaps keep the buckles from scarring your paint, and it's easy to drive with the thin straps in the car. However, on the second car I put these on, one with the mast antenna coming out of the back, the foam blocks were too low to give the board clearance over the antenna. An easy mod was to use duct tape to put some rigid foam under the rear block, this elevates the board enough to give clearance. Make sure you know what your car needs before you buy!"
3,Don't leave it on your car in the rain...,"Product worked well, not great with a longboard though. Make sure you secure the board to your car using rope as well. I also found out that you should be sure to remove the rack every night if you're not in a covered parking area as it rained the last night of my trip and the straps absorbed the water and soaked my car ceiling leaving water stains on it. So yea, it's an ok product that will get your board from point a to point b with minimal to no damage."
4,works great,Cheap and useful rack. Relatively easy to put on to almost any car. I've loaded at least 4 boards onto this single wrap rack.
1,Dented the roof of my car,"I guess this falls under the catagory: You get what you pay for. The rack didn't cost too much. But when I drove over 35 or 40 miles an hour, the front rack lifted up and pushed down on the back rack and left a dent in the center of my roof. My suggestion is don't go cheap unless you have a junker car that you don't mind having a dent in the roof."
1,They Work Great,I have a Chrysler 300 so I needed some soft racks that fit a big car. These racks do the job. I only 6 miles from the ocean front and have not had any issues yet.
4,Good product,"I've driven probably 3,000 miles with these racks and two longboards on my car. It takes some practice to find the sweet spot for your board and your car, but once you've got the routine down, these racks are rock solid. Like the reviewer before me said, don't buy these if you've got an antenna in the middle of your roof or those seatbelts that automatically slide forward and backwards, like those that were made in the early '90s."
3,Questionable at highway speeds,"It seems that no surf rack manufacturer wants to list helpful information - such as dimensions - online, so I just had to order something and see how it worked. The directions that came with it were not much better. So what I don't know is whether my 9x3 stand-up paddleboard is too wide to be compatible with these racks. I simply could not get them tight enough to hold my board down comfortably at highway speeds, and after stopping three times to tighten them, I ended up using a rope toward the front of the car for extra support. Maybe it's because this is the first time I was using it, and the straps need to stretch out a bit. I don't know. They're fine up to about 35mph, but after that, it's a scary ride. I do recommend putting the front rack as close to the front of the car as possible; that seems to stabilize it. But pull tight, and have a rope for backup!"
2,problem in rain,"It is compact and convenient for instant use purpose, as it takes 5-10 min for me to set it up from scratch. However, in rain, drips from the strap make the interior wet pretty much. It may be more problem by the material (webbing), rather than the thickness of the strap. Since my car is a 1 year old Mazda 3, the door shield is almost in the perfect condition."
1,And the legend continues... to be not heard of by anyone,"A sad excuse for a movie that does not do much to fix the stereotypical redneck view of the Arkansas population. A movie fully deserving it's MST3k treatment. If you like this movie, I pity you greatly."
3,A Goa flashback from 1996,"Out of Our Depth has released a disc that sounds like the last two years of psy-trance simply never happened. And this is a good thing. While the trend in the Goa world has been toward ever more minimal and club-friendly tunes, OOOD is good old-fashioned MAXIMAL trance. The first five tracks are fast, relentless, and densely layered with killer riffs. ""Ciderspace"" and ""Find Your Mind"" are probably destined to become classics. The last three tracks are pleasant downtempo stuff, but nothing earthshattering. As an album, Breathing Space is kind of uneven, but for the Goa fan or DJ, it's an absolute must."
5,Find out how to obtain TRUE SUCCESS - A definite MUST READ,"Lee Milteer shares her insight in human nature and success. As the subtitle denotes, she shares with her readers ""the secrets to getting anything you want"". This book seems to be a compilation of her previous work, all in one place. Don't buy this book if you are looking for a ""get rich quick scheme."" Having followed her career since I was a freshman in college, I can say that her thoughts and ideas provide the insight you will need to be successful in any industry.Glen Stancil, President, PCERT"
1,Much better books out there,"I bought this book together with several others. The kits shown are outdated, and the projects are neither unique or unusual. A better bet is ""The Pen Turners Workbook"" which gives you more interesting projects and a better written book."
2,Just Ok,"The book does contain a lot of pens that are unusual; however, I wanted more information about turning small coves or other decorations. I also wanted some unusual design ideas - not just using different wood or putting in blocks of different wood, but designing the pen itself. Making it easier to hold or write with or changing the balance or length etc for the purpose of improving the product, not just the look.Anyway, the book does have a lot of pens displayed and gives the pen turner a lot of ideas about changing the look by changing the wood and how the wood is cut and glued together. The key is using different materials for the pen itself."
5,This is as Good as House Music Gets,"I own all the Hed Kandi stuff and various other house compilations and easily this is the one that I go back to time and time again while deejaying.Don't be put off by the ""disco"" tag; while some tracks have a somewhat 70s disco tinge to them the majority are just flat-out kickass house jams and some of the hookiest I've ever heard.""New Horizons"" (check out that insane bass line!) was an instant favorite, but there's plenty to choose from.If you want melodic house for the dance floor, consider this your blueprint and build from there. The Ministry of Sound and Ibiza-type collections have their moments, but lately seem somewhat dominated by--eek!--trance, which I generally despise."
3,"""Heaven"" Can Wait.","Anyone who names a compilation ""Disco Heaven"" is setting themselves up for extremely high expectations. It's therefore with regret that I announce that I wasn't totally thrilled with this double CD. Much of the material (a collection of low-key house and neo disco) is quite competent and likeable, but a lot of it is forgettable. The songs bleed into each other with very little distinction or personality. Add to the fact that a great deal of these tracks appear on compilations I already own (Kim English, Jamiroquai, Kings of Tomorrow). I'm not knocking this CD at all, but I've certainly heard better from the Hed Kandi series. Get it used if you can."
3,Not what I expected,"The first entry in the Disco Heaven series. A lot of the songs here are low key house/US Garage. There's some good jams but overall I wasn't blown away or anything. Still there's some good jams, but I feel like it could have been much more."
5,"VERY KANDI , VERY STYLE","Disco , luxe, style , Lounge , voice , vogue, glitter, sexy ,hot ,feeling ,action , and many more .....There is not words to discribe this copilationAlex Colvic"
2,"Seen ""The Usual Suspects""? Then you've read this book...","This book isn't bad per se, but it isn't at all creative. It uses six of Marvel's most familiar villains in what can best be described as Bryan Singer's ""The Usual Suspects"" as a comic book. The cast (especially Deadpool, Sabretooth and Bullseye) make it interesting, but it would have been nice for it to have been more original."
1,Precision not what it used to be,"Precision Great Crate 4000 not what it used to be. Rec'd my order and the door end panel doesn't fit properly, nor does the door lift and close easily. The wire used for this crate is light weight and flimsy. Very disappointed. I'm returning it."
4,Nice Crate,"This crate has been great for use by our Labrador puppy. The crate divider is excellent for changing the size of the crate as she grows. She is a heavy, strong little girl, and she is teething, so she can destroy most toys within a few minutes. She has chewed on the door repeatedly and it has not even bent slightly. The man who runs my local shelter uses one for his pitbull, who has chewed his way out of every other crate EXCEPT this one, which was why he recommended it to us. Our puppy also likes to dig in absolutely everything... the carpet, her current bed, dirt, etc., and she has tried to dig her way out of the plastic tray on the bottom of the crate, to no avail. The scratches barely even show up in the plastic.As an added bonus, the brand that makes this crate also makes machine-washable pet beds that fit their crates perfectly. The pet beds have plenty of cushioning while still being washable, which I love."
5,Happy Cage Owner,"We have two of these cages in the 36""x23"" size. I have used them for several dogs over the past 4-5 years (3 German Shepherds, a Texas Blue Lacy, and a Golden Retriever). They have withstood years of use, as well as travel between my house and my parents house for when the dog visits them. It is easy to fold down and set up again. I would highly recommend this cage. Currently, my brother has one for his dog, I have one for my dog, and I'm thinking of getting one to keep at my parents' house."
3,4 dewclaws up (sort of),"Easy to assemble, light but quite sturdy. Added cable ties to the top edges for a bit more security. No sharp edges, and 2 doors are very convenient.Added Jan. 2012. Crate floor/tray has cracked in 3 or 4 places and now I have to track down the product warranty. So I have down-rated from 5*."
1,Apparently not dog proof.,"I put this item together exactly as described, and have been using it for about 5 days. That is all the time it took for my 2lb yorkie to figure out how to open the door. I am definitely latching it properly and carefully, especially after the first time I found her in the middle of the floor when I came home. Now I have to figure out how to do something additionally to keep her inside, or the whole thing is a wash...I am pretty disappointed."
4,Mostly fantastic,"I really love this crate. So far puppy hasn't managed to do any damage to it though she bounces around inside and tries to chew on the bars when she's bored. My only complaint is that the door bars seem to bend a bit from her bouncing, making it difficult to latch the door so you have to be extra careful when closing it - or you might come home one day to find the puppy chasing the cats."
5,Great crate indeed!,"I'm not sure if this is exactly the same measurement we have, ours if for a 90 lb dog. We keep our 16 lb dog in it during the day. It is easy to clean, sturdy, and the doors close easily. We found a clip on water bowl at a pet store, got a dog bed from Target, and she was set. I feel confident I can leave her in this crate, go to work, and she'll be safe and comfortable. We do have a plastic sheet under it in case of spills; it is on our carpet in the living room. This is a great product."
1,Save your money & your pet's health,"This is by far the worst pet crate I've ever seen.Within 2 weeks of my purchase, the bottom tray broke. My dog was also able to bend the wires to escape from the crate.In all my years as a dog owner, I have never heard of such a thing.If you check out other product review sites for this model you will see this is a common problem."
4,Folksy renditions of Chanukah songs,"Cantor Ginsburgh's renditions of traditional Chanukah songs (and a number which I believe are not traditional but still appropriate) are folksy and catchy. Buy this CD for your children so that we will not have to deal with ""A Very Teletubby Chanukah"" or ""Barney Lights the Menorah"" (that's sarcasm; not real titles).This CD includes the Chanukah blessings, great to play when you light the menorah.I have one criticism of this CD, which made me give it four stars rather than five. Cantor Ginsburgh takes the song ""This Little Light of Mine"" and makes it ""These Chanukah Lights of Mine"". Unfortunately, she sings it with a chorus of children who sound like they are just kids from her congregation, not talented children selected for their voices. The result is an unlistenable version of what could have been a nice song.Otherwise, recommended."
5,Great as collectibles!,"I bought Luigi and Guido for my 25-month old son at a regular toy store a couple of months ago since he is big into Cars (and so are we). The two cars look and feel great, though their durability seems to be questionable, especially in the hands of one so young. As a result, I would recommend this set more so as collectibles rather than for everyday rough play. For amazing looking Cars let me recommend the Boot Camp military-themed 6-pack gift set along with the fire-themed 6-pack gift set!"
1,asthma meds,"This product does not work at all. I found no releif from my asthma with this product, I had to go back to my inhailer."
5,Entertaining and Inspiring,"PERFECTLY written by an author who knows the language upside down. Crystal takes seemingly boring topics such as etymology, lexicology... and makes them interesting, educative, and entertaining. His writing style is appealing and 'simple' such that anybody can read it without being bogged down.He has subtle advices for wannabe word-detectives, too. You are assured to be entertained from the very first word... you will love it."
3,"Entertaining, But Not Authoritative","This is a book that's perfect for reading in bits and pieces, and enjoyable enough on those terms. (Crystal does an especially good job writing for both UK and US audiences.) But it doesn't hold up for more serious use. Since there is no documentation--no footnotes or endnotes, not even a bibliography--it's impossible to check the author's claims. Crystal repeats (without attribution) an urban legend about the origin of ""404"" on page 7, and I therefore took his claims in the rest of the book with a grain of salt. This is not the level of careful research or presentation I expect from someone with Crystal's credentials."
1,Weak Heroine!!,"I was very disappointed by this book. The heroine, Kid Calhoun, sets out to avenge the death of her murdered uncle. But, because she is a woman and, therefore, infinitely weaker than any man, she is too overtaken by her emotions to follow through on her vow of vengence. I was very insulted by this book. Why create a heroine who dresses up as a young man and rides with a band of outlaws if you are just going to make her a weakling? I could understand if the author was against killing, but the heroes in this book have no qualms about killing the villians. I would rather have a strong heroine who is not defined by stereotypes."
1,SAFE Home Inventory Software,"Didn't work for me-If you are a non-techy senior like me, be sure you don't have Windows 7! Won't work on anything newer than XP-says so in their description."
5,Fantastic!,"I am only at 65% in this book but can say already that it is a spell-binder! I have a very hard time putting the book down. I am a Michael Connelly, John Grisham, Lee Child fan and now have another author I will follow closely! I cannot wait until the next novel comes out."
2,Fairly Lame,"I was seriously misled by the 5-star ratings given by the two previous reviewers, one of whom is apparently related to the authors and the other a youngster who isn't even a reader. I've never seen so many grammatical errors, and the plot is about as suspenseful as a romance for teen-age girls."
4,Interesting Travel Logue and Memoir,"This is a story of a woman and her many travels throughout her life with her husband and children. I bought it because I thought it was more about her Near-death experiences and how she coped with that, but the story is really about HER. Yes, she does have some Near-Death Experiences, but that is only secondary is the story behind her terrible asthma problems. Her travelling experiences are interesting, especially about different cultures, like Iran and other countries, but most of the book in entertwined around her asthma difficulties. Perhaps the title should read ""My Asthma and Europe"". That would be more appropiate. Bottom Line : I did enjoy the book for the travel narrative, but I'm a little tired of her affliction and she's too far away from me to hand her an inhaler, so I got frustrated."
4,"Good source for custom painting, but some unneeded info","If you are going to do a custom paint job yourself, it would make sense that you're an experienced painter. This book has some unneeded information, as basics on painting in general, like surface prep, mixing paints, etc. I don't think a custom painter would want to waste his/her time reading this information all over again.This book is not all that bad, as there are some good information within it's content.It shows you how to mask custom flames/stripes, etc. I would not rely on this one book as your only source of information for custom painting."
3,Good mystery but NO Holmes,"If you can ignore the name of Mycroft Holmes on this (and the reference to the Conan-Doyle estate) then this is a 3 star mystery.It just isn't the Mycroft Holmes from Conan-Doyle (which is kind of distracting). There is no Holmesian deduction, Mycroft isn't Mycroft, I don't know why this wasted Mycroft's name on this. (And Watson appears, but just as a generic doctor)."
2,"Budget, yes...",but I recommend going with a different manufacturer. The base speaker went bad after a few months and no longer works. Whats funny is it went bad overnight when it wasn't even in use. Never had the volume above 50%; used mostly for gaming.Try the Logitech speakers around this price range (good reviews) or spend more and get a good set of speakers.
4,A great little series.,"I don't recall why I got this when I was younger. Guess it just looked cool to me, & it truly is. My favorite thing about it is that it reminds me so much of the serious Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon. The only thing I don't like is the time spent showing the life of Willy. He's not a bad character; it's just the time spent in his world is so boring and bland compared to the battles in the aniverse. Still, when it's not focused on him there's plenty of action, great characters & even a couple dramatic moments (the scene where Bucky realizes he's too late to rescue his fellow hares gets me every time). It's not a classic, but it's still above average. They released all 13 episodes on 6 VHS tapes, and they're worth getting if you ask me."
3,Wow! I thought they burned these tapes.,"I can vaguely remember watching these cartoons on a few Saturday mornings at six thirty. DEFINITE LITTLE KID FILMS The plots never seemed that good as I look back on it, but certain young teens may remember these as ""good"""
4,A spick in the sand!,"I enjoyed this great book. The allegory used for the book deserves our compliments. In this story, Bubber, a lemming goes out to search for reasons why lemmings do what they do. He is influenced by many different opinions that confused him even more. Different readers will interpret this differently."
4,"The Lemming Condition is simply written, but powerful.","The story is a wonderful one. The characters are well-developed and seem almost human, but still retain their animal attributes. The book is a quick read, but manages to get its point across in just a few pages. You feel for Bubber as he questions whether he should conform or break away from tradition. Bubber's struggle is the heart of the story. Adults enjoy it more than children can because they've often asked the same questions about society and the way that it works. The Lemming Condition is a short story about growing up and self-discovery. I enjoyed, sympathized, and understood."
4,Who Woulda Thought?!,"At a glance, Arkin's children story look just like that: a children's story. But once the reader dives into Arkin's world of lemmings, we find the genre label far from this. Arkin presents a wonderful allegory by using colorful characters from the naive to the sarcastic. To my surprise, the moral of this well hidden allegory is not only for children, but adults as well. My only concern is, is the use of language in a book ""intended"" for juveniles."
2,A disappointing allegory,"I found this short novel to be lacking in the components that would normally draw a reader like myself into a story. The lack of any humor whatsoever and the ominous forboding throughout the entire story resulted in disinterest on my part. I'm all for what this story is supposed to teach you (thinking for yourself, induvidualism) but there are much better ways to go about it. However, I did think the author was very competent and the symbolism used throughout was thought-provoking. I recommend this if you're into the whole symbolism bit."
5,"Simple, yet Serious",The Lemming Condition is a simple but thought-provoking tale on a young Lemming's struggle to go his own way in life and not follow the pack. It is a very relatable story and is a great read for people of all ages.
4,Arkin's allegory... almost perfect,"I almost absolutely loved this book! The only negative comment I could say about it is that I got somewhat frustrated with how juvinile it was. It wasn't until I began thinking about the different levels of the story that it began to get interesting. But over all, it was cute."
3,Lemming Condition,"The Lemming Condition is a book for many different people. I now know that I am not one of the people it is for. I did find it appealing, and most parts were easy to follow along. I think the reason that I think that it is not a book for me is because it became very redundant with our class doing so much on it. There are a lot of ways to like the story, since there is depth to it with the allegorical level. I may have not liked the book, but I'm sure that others would like it if they weren't exposed to it so much like I was."
3,A fun allegory,"The Lemming Condition was a cute children's book about a bunch of furry, cuddly little lemmings. For me, the intrigue of this book was in the cute lemmings.The allegorical portion of this story didn't really catch my attention, and, because of that, I tend to think of this as purely a children's story."
3,What could have been a good thing,"The lemming condition was way too short. It had strong potentual, but it fell short with it's lack of words. By the time you get interested, the story is near the end. Now i can see how the story is long enough for little kids, but i am reading this as a class project in High School, and for me this story is too short. It could have been a good story."
3,The sequel is better.,"Read the sequel instead. It's called The Clearing and its a much better book. You don't need to read the Lemming Condition first, it's nicely recapped early in the sequel. I've read many many books in my life and The Clearing is one of my favorites. Full of zen wisdom and subtle humor it's a book you won't soon forget.Alan Arkin, ladies and gentlemen, poet and a prophet."
3,a beautiful allegory,"The story takes place in a lemming community on the day where all lemmings are to jump off the cliffs into the ocean, for it is what has been done for generations. Bubber a young lemming has trouble with this and wonders why they should jump into the ocean. I felt this story to be very intreaging and even though it didn't have any blood or guts, it kept my attention thoughout the book. This was the first book I've read by Alan Arkin, but after this well written allegory I don't think it will be the last."
3,Enforced review...,"The one major downfall of this book is it's length, or lack thereof. The author could have gone into much more depth than he did."
4,An entertaining look at a personified lemming's struggle,"The Lemming Condition is a short story about Bubber the adolecent lemming durring the time of ""the great walk"". Bubber, the main character begins to question his surroundings which leads him to the truth. What he discovers is the truth is, nobody DOES know what is happening. After finding this out, his curiosity derives him to discover the truth about his species and himself on his own. In this process he discovers the nature of the lemming. This book is deffinately worth the read considering mostly its size and dynamic nature. Although it has the pretence of a childrens novel, it contains a metephoric composition and a personification that you can not help but be drawn in. I would recomend this book to anyone with a free 20 minutes."
3,Not that great...,"Cover all basics, but in tutorial rather than reference form. Not all tutorials work due to ttypos and poor editing. Oh, and it is all Max 8."
2,For C++ jocks only.,Stuck in chapter 6 on STL. I feel the title should warn java programmers to avoid this one.
2,"""Never mind the quality, feel the width"".","I've never used a ""Teach Yourself ..."" or ""Dummy's"" book before so I had high hopes of overcoming the steep learning curve of CORBA with this one. To be fair, the introductory chapter(s) were very useful but the book never got up to speed after that. Once into the examples there's little to be gained over reading the source (available on the web). One thing which particularly annoyed me was the repetition of the *same* code three or four times; and cases of 100s of lines being reprinted to show maybe a 10-line change in context struck me as a total waste of trees. It would have been more useful and less wasteful had it delved deeper into the Services and Facilities which were given a very scant treatment. -- Extremely disappointed."
4,Provides a very good kick start to CORBA,I first skimmed over the book. Now I just finished going over the examples in the book. If you are one of those people who like to get a little proof-of-concept example working in order to get enthusiasm to learn more then this is the right book.
2,Short and simple,"I can't figure out what is so special about this book. I found it very simple and my 2.5 year old is not particularly engaged by it. I was hoping to find a book about friends for my daugher. For a book on friendship, we like ""Little Blue Truck"" much better."
3,Good grief,"This book isn't about friendship -- it is about interrupting, bossing, and bugging.I'll grant that the illustrations are dynamite.As a mother, if you recognize one of your children in the Bear character, you are going to have a hard time putting up with that goose."
3,Failed to hook me.,"I was rather disappointed with this book as the overall story failed to grab me. I enjoyed Lt. Hawk's role in the book and I wish we would be seeing more of him as I think the Enterprise could use some crew rotations. Riker's continued rejection of command can't be doing his career much good. Back to the novel, Hawk's contemplation of the morality of Section 31 was very interesting and I think the authors did an excellent job of presenting the organization as a moral gray area. The ""controversal"" subplot is just that. If anything, I'm surprised that the Star Trek universe has not addressed this issue before. I didn't become preoccupied with looking for double entendres. If I had access to a holodeck, I'd probably run a pirate simulation, too."
3,Worth the read,"Pocket books has made great stride in their Star Trek franchise these last couple of years and I'm glad to see that they are still not afraid to give new ideas a try. This first book in the Section 31 series is a well rounded read. It is more adult in nature than most of the novels to date. And noteworthy to say that there is the first ongoing ...relationship in Star Trek (I might be wrong on this.) I always wanted to know more about Lieutenant Hawk, I really wished he'd survived First Contact, and this book really flesh out a character that had promise. It is good to see that the pristine Federation has a dark underside. I'm looking forward to seeing more of it in the next three novels."
3,Okay,"This book really upset me that they made Mr. Hawk gay. It took a lot of interest I had in the book away. In first contact they did not make Hawk look like he was gay at all. The authors ruined the story a lttle bit by that. And they put the action in the middle of the book more like on page 134 ant that is when it gets more interesting. I really would not recommend this book even though it isn't a really bad book I guess it is worth it to read it once, but nomore than that."
1,Total waste of time and money,"The authors obsession with creating a homosexual character added absolutely nothing to the story line. If anything it only served to reinforce out dated theories that homosexuals very susceptable for being converted into ""spys"" having finally found a group who accepts them, at least on the surface.Perhaps the author did not view his writing a a soap box to promote an agenda. But the poor thought or lack of talent to bring in the topic with some relevance was lost. You could rip out the pages which broach the homosexual topic and find that the remainder of the story whould have been totally unaffected.Hugely disappointing. Steer well clear of this author."
2,Not your fathers Star Trek,A great sci-fi series has been transported from gender neutral to outright gay. Star Trek has always beeen tolerant of views but these authors take it way out of line. I wouldn't let my children read this.
1,Worst Overall Star Trek Novel I've Ever Read,"I wish I hadn't purchased this one. I should have read the reviews first. Few of them however, look past the obvious controversy and take into account the poor quality of the whole storyline, and weak characterizations which constantly reminded me of clips hacked from the tv shows. The image of Section 31 as having any intelligence has been severly tarnished. It was immediately obvious that their mission objective was faulty and ill-conceived and their operatives are real stooges. And I had to try really hard to be open-minded and get through all the gay parts, but the author really goes to far with them, planting them like little stink-bombs around every corner, and I feel that he completely ruined a book that was already pretty shallow anyway. I'm so dissapointed that I'm tempted to stop reading Star Trek novels completely now."
1,Watch Out!!,"If profanity and/or the homosexual lifestyle offends you, stay clear of this book. This is my first purchase of a Star Trek novel and I am VERY disappointed!"
1,"Disappointing, not worth your time","It's a shame when writing science fiction takes a back seat to social agenda. The book is boring, and suffers from the author's agenda to write about homosexual relationships, over good science fiction."
1,The Writer Puts Several GAY Reverences In This Book,Stat Trek Section 31: RogueThe story is perverted beyond belief! I can't beleive the author chose to Change several star trek characters in to gays.Who reads this: Children for the most part.I AM DISGUSTED by this attempt by gays such as the author to entice other people to become gay! If you want to be gay fine but don't go around brainwashing children into thinking it cool to be gay. If later on they decide to be gay once again fine but don't influence something THAT IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS!!!!!
2,Section Thirty-WHAT?,"This is an average StarTrek TNG book and a horrible Section 31 book. In fact, you could replace every mention of Section 31 with something or someone else (just choose your enemy) and it would not affect the story a bit.I was expecting an exciting book about the exploits of Section 31 and how powerful they were. Instead of the elite unit they are suppose to be, they are constantly being beat and outwitted by the Enterprise crew, the Tal Shiar, and all sorts of other beings.If you want to read a good book about Section 31, this one is definitely not it. I just hope the other Section 31 books are not as bad as this one."
3,"A Good Read, but not that good.","The story theme, Section 31 is very good, the story line is also very good, and so is the writing, but this ""gay character"" stuff killed the book. It is something totally unecessary in a book shcu as this one. As a fan of Star Trek, I would buy all Section 31 books but this one. Don't waste your money on this one!"
3,Finally a Heroic Openly Gay Enterprise Crew Member,"This second entry in the Section 31 quartet was especially interesting for me. For a rare change, a central human character is clearly gay. He actually has a boyfriend on the Enterprise, and is out to the entire crew. The primary characters acknowledge their relationship and respect it. This is shamefully unusual territory for the world of Star Trek, which is supposed to promote equality for all people. It is very enjoyable to see this type of guy included in the story and treated as heroic, rather than as a villain. I appreciated this volume in the series, and look forward to reading the remaining two books.Michael Travis Jasper, author of the novel ""To Be Chosen"""
1,This is free on Google Books,I ordered this book thinking I'd be getting an actual book. What I received was a printout of what I had already found on Google Books for free. They attached a cover on card stock with a spiral binding which I could have done myself with my binding machine. I was very disappointed. Many of the pages printed have missing words that are clear on the PDF on Google's website. I'm chalking this one up to lesson learned and hoping to save someone else some money.
2,It's won't work for me,"I had a high hope on this product, and the source naturals is the well-known company for several years. However, this product simply doesn't work for me.So I suggest try smallest bottle first, because you'll never know that does it 'hit' or 'miss'. result may vary.At this moment, the combination of acetyl L-cartinine + gingko biloba extract would be remained as my favorite."
2,Doesnt work for me,I havn't tried it for very long but i dont notice any noticable changes. Everyone says how it works instantly but I have even tried upping the dose and I still don't feel any different.
2,Didn't work for me,I tried the Source Naturals L-Theanine 200mg tablets and found no effects. I was disappointed and had hoped for more. It did seem to give me a bit of a headache.
2,Side effects without effects,"I have Generalized Anxiety disorder and, as such, have tried various precription and nonprescription formulations to treat anxiety. This L-Theanine seemed like a good option, worth trying.What I found from taking L-Theanine, is that I don't feel particularly calmed, but if get up to stand I will feel a little dizzy and slow. This reminds me of a side effect from gaba-enhancing benzodiazepines (xanax, klonopin) , without the actual soothing effect.What has worked better for me personally, in the world of natural health, has been:* Breathing exercises and meditation, such as those taught inMeditation For Optimum Health [Explicit]* Pharma Gaba, the chewable product works well with few side effects :Natural Factors Stress-Relax Pharma Gaba Chewable Tablets, 60-Count* Passionflower extract in water --Passionflower Extract 1 OuncesI really was hoping for L-Theanine to work, as it is both energizing and relaxing. But it did not really work in my case."
1,Didn't work for me,"I've heard good things about L-Theanine, but everyone's body is different and unfortunately this product didn't help my anxiety at all. I took it before bed and had a VERY hard time sleeping, similar to how I would feel if I drank a lot of caffeine. Although I can see how L-Theanine might improve concentration during the day, it did nothing for my anxiety and made me feel tense and wired. For me, Taurine and Lemon Balm work much better for anxiety and insomnia. But the L-Theanine was cheap and worth a try!"
5,Seems to work,"Saw this product (not the mfg) on Dr. Oz. It does seem to help me fall alseep at night.. Happy with the results. Product seems to be packaged well and seems fresh, will purchase again from this maker."
4,better than the first TPB,"this book collects issues #7-12. like the first book, this TPB has some pretty middling humor, but still has somewhat interesting new characters. the first arc, w/ ho-hum work by dave ross, has the team fighting some animated waxworks, and isn't that memorable. however, the second arc is more amusing and has better art (by clayton henry). the arc riffs on the famous ""days of future past"" x-men storyline and despite its twisty time-travelling setup, the story has more action than the other storylines. and although the ending is very abrupt due to the fact the series got cancelled, all in all it's not a bad ending to a doomed-from-the-start series."
1,LOUSY Products from a Lousy Company,I got one of these CD players for Christmas and it broke the 2nd time I used. TARGET wouldn't exchange it becuase I didn't have a receipt (It was a dang Christmas present!) I called GPX and they wanted me to ship the player back to them which cost $10 and mail them a check for $15. So it would cost me another $25 to replace it. GPX is a lousy company that makes lousy products. You would have to be a FOOL to buy this product.
3,Suffer... Until Icefire,"Well... this book is mainly about David Rain moving in with the Pennykettles, they're clay dragons, and Bonnington(cat).Squirrels are everything after that. I hated this book... But you have to read it to understand the rest of the series. I just started book 5 Dark Fire and i've been in love with the series since book 2 Icefire, Sooooo KEEP READING until Icefire... Then keep reading the entire series."
5,great,My 8 year old loves this series. He also loves Harry Potter and Diary of Wimpy Kid so that might give you an idea of reading level for this book
5,Great Read,"This book was an awesome read to share with my little ones. Charming and engaging. We all couldn't wait to find out what happens next, both with Conker the squirrel and with David and his clay dragon Gadzooks. Looking forward to reading the next one!"
1,"stupfying writing, unbelievable characters, terrible","I am a huge lover of books of many types, have five children and read aloud daily and we loved Chronicles of Narnia, Little House series, Beatrix Potter, Harry potter, Milly Molly Mandy, the Moffats and many, many more well-written stories. We hated The Fire Within and had to force ourselves to finish it. The story has potential--dragons which live in modern times and work with the energy of humans who own them, and a side story about squirrels--but the story is not interesting enough to slog through the bad, bad, bad writing. It is dull, bland, soporific, boring, and not one of us (age 7-40-plus) liked it even a little. Not worth itand I wish I could have the time back in my life spent reading it."
3,This Book Has Its Ups And Downs- Bharat,"This book is okay. It had a very good story sound to it. The book is about a boy named David and he moves in the same house as a mother and her daughter, Lucy. David then write a book. The mother, Liz has a collection of clay dragons that may come to life. Her 11 year old daughter, Lucy soons becomes friends with David and they must master the magic of the Fire Within. This book is not very interesting. It also doesn't make much sense.If the author fixes these things I think this would be the best book ever."
5,My son was enthralled!,"My 10 year old son received this book for Christmas, and since he was already in the first chapters of a long book that he was reading on his own, we began reading 'The Fire Within' together before bed. All 3 of us were hooked by the 2nd chapter! We were constantly wondering about the dragons......subtle hints let us know they were ""special"", and we all loved the squirrels, and worried about poor Conker. Every night my son begged for extra chapters. He is not a bookworm and we have to force the start of his own reading time, but once he begins, he usually reads for longer than his mandatory 30 minutes. He'd rather be playing baseball, basketball or a video game than read a book any day, unfortunately. So you can see his interests lie in active things, but this book kept him totally enthralled! I recommend it highly and it also makes a great family read!"
5,"Great book, no violence or bad language","I pre-read this book for my 5- and 7-year old sons. They love dragons, but many of the dragon books and movies are a bit too violent in my opinion. I finished the book in two days because I couldn't put it down. I loved the squirrel plot and the mysterious clay dragons. I just bought the next two books in the series - Icefire and Firestar. I hope they are as good as the first."
4,The Fire Within,"The Fire Within is a fictional book with a touch of fantasy. It took Chris D'Lacey 15 years to write this novel, but it was definitely worth the wait. Can squirrels, a family of two, and clay dragons change a college student's life?When a tenant named David moves into a house in Wayward Crescent, strange things start to happen. To add on top of it all, Lucy and Liz, the owners of the house, give him a strange clay dragon. The dragon inspires David to write a story that helps him master the magical fire within. Within what? Read the book to find out.Chris did a great job with voice because I could really get a sense of his characters, and his personality. I could almost imagine myself in this funny, semi-mysterious book. I could almost feel the fire within.In conclusion, this book was great. I recommend this book for ages 10+. If you love fiction and fantasy all rolled into one, you will enjoy this book and all the squirrels and dragons in The Fire Within."
4,Good book for squirrel lovers,The first book does not have a lot of dragons in it but a lot of squirrels in the book
3,Very good,It was a very good book. I couldn't stop reading it. Put just the right scenes where needed. Can't wait for book 2!
1,Dragons = Squirrels? Not really,"What is going on here - I mean, I understand Young Adult Fantasy is to reach out to have younger generations get into reading, but a book that is supposed to be about dragons in a modern day setting, and it does have dragons - kind of - but it is mainly about squirrels - I am sure that there is a point, but it was not made by the half way point, and I could not continue on - this is a one star because you cannot give a book nothing and rate it to - I tried, and I wanted to, but this book did absolutely nothing for me except frustrate me and waste an evening."
1,Neo's Review,"This book is frankly not that good, I'm sorry its just boring. Almost all of the story is about saving a squirrel. And after a while it just gets tiring. I actually stopped reading this book and then went back to it because my friend told me the series got better and it actually did. But I'll review those on a later date. The only thing that would make me recommend this book to someone to read is if they plan on reading the rest of the series."
5,Got for someone else,Got this book for my boyfriend's little sister who's 14. She really seems to enjoy this series. Good read for young adults.
2,is this REALLY about dragons???,"when I picked this out, I said ""I'm in for a great dragon story"" But I was quite dissapointed when I read a book about a guy who wrote a book about a squirrel with minimal help from a dragon who helped with word choices. If you like sqirrels, then this is a fine book."
4,Great sight for the money!,If you are looking for a enexpensive bow sightthis would be a good purchase. I'm satisfied withit's quality( well made.)
4,Things are getting Better,"The figure displays an excellent ""Tiger Jacket"" summer camouflage pattern. This must be the reason the figure comes with a sun tan face. Since both the Waffen SS and the Wehrmacht both wore this type of camo it is not clear what service this figure represents because of lack of insignia. But, the black patch's on his coller might be that if the dreaded Waffen-SS. Overall a good figure that just might represent one of the most notorious armed units of the German forces."
4,intel processer 775 2.8,"Bought the product, installed and works well, had no issues except for the shipping, paid for 1-3 day and received in 5 days."
3,Wrong Processor,"The processor that I recieved would not work in my computer.I felt that it was my fault for ordering the wrong item,so I just kept it."
3,"I love Rachmaninoff, but this was pretty disappointing.","The Isle of the Dead, despite its intriguing name, really can't compare in quality to some of Rachmaninoff's more famous works (his piano concertos for instance). It had some of Rachmaninoff's sparks of genius, but the ratio of wonderful sound to mediocre sound was too low, in my opinion.They must not have had the song samples on this web site when I ordered this CD, because I hadn't realized that the Etudes (originally written for piano) had been orchestrated, thereby destroying much of the texture that had made them beautiful. If you're looking for Rachmaninoff's Etudes Tableux, I recommend the CD with Nelson Goerner on piano (it also contains Sonata No. 2 Op. 36).I give this CD 3 stars because listening to Rachmaninoff is always enjoyable, but there are so many better Rachmaninoff CDs out there."
3,Nice break from horror,"Pick up this book to break from the horror I usually read. Don't read a lot in this genre so... but overal I thought this book was good. I read it in a night and would read it again. It isn't my fave and I really don't care for the ending, but like I said it is worth reading that is why I gave it a 3"
4,In-depth and intriguing,"An entertaining, if verbose, description of the rise of populism in the late Republic. The work and style are dated but contain detailed narration and analysis of themes that should be familiar to most dilettantes in Roman history. Unfortunately in the Kindle edition the footnote superscripts do not link to the footnote itself, so following references is challenging."
3,A little slow but will get the job done,"This item is not instant at all. I usually start a bottle warmimg about 30 min b4 my sons feeding time.Also you have to be careful not to accidently activate it because you can only use it once. Then you have to boil it for 20 mins. to re-activate it.It's a good back-up. the best car warmer is the ""fast warmer"" by the first years. It's the best."
2,what happen?,I got it out of the package and followed the instructions but it didn't even warm my bottle. Consequently now i use it as a bottle carrier but thats it.
1,Terrible! Don't Waste Your Money!,"We got this instead of a car warmer becuase we could use it no matter where we were.....We should have just bought the car warmer. This worked good the first time we used it. But then the second time it didn't get real hot at all (real fun with a screaming baby getting our taxes done). I figured maybe we didnt boil it long enough or something. I tried boiling it again and after only 5 minutes the thing started melting and turning brown. Needless to say it never worked again, just the very first time. Im glad we got it on clearance, but it was still wasted money!"
3,Good in a pinch but SLLLOW,"My son would only drink a hot bottle so we had little options when it came to traveling and ""on-the'go"" bottles. I purchased this product and while it got the job done it literally took almost 20 minutes to warm the bottle up to the temperature that my son preferred. It would eventually get the job done, but in a pinch it was less than ideal to have to wait 20 minutes when you have a screaming baby."
2,Wouldnt buy again,"The only time I used this warmer was when I took it out of the packaging to test it. Then I put it in boiling water like the instructions said for 15 minutes to ""reactivate."" And it never reactived the crystals; needless to say, I put it back in the box and its been sitting there. Save yourself the money! Still looking for a decent travel warmer."
2,it's okay - not good if you have a baby who wants to eat right away,"It's okay. it does warm the bottle slightly - but my baby can't wait that long. once he decides he wants to eat he wants to eat! the boiling is also a little time consuming.I don't use this item too much - also tough to fit the tall Dr. Brown's bottles in. all in all, I could have done without purchasing this product."
2,It's ok in a pinch,The warmer doesn't do a great job of warming a bottle from an ice pak cooler or the fridge. You must take the bottle out of the cooler 30-45 minutes ahead of time then once the chill is somewhat off the bottle heat up the heat pack from the warmer and apply it. Even then it just barely warms the bottle to luke warm.
4,Works well!,"I did not give the product 5 stars because right now I do not know how long it takes to heat up a bottle for readiness. I usually leave the house with bottle in the warmer and use it within 1 hour and the bottle has been ready when I needed it. I did not use the bottle one time but it was still warm after 3 hours. It is very convenient and easy to use! I haven't used it for long roadtrips, but if I did I would bring a second warmer because you need to boil it before using it again. I bought this because of a friend's suggestion and I am not disappointed. I do need to get another warmer...just in case!"
1,Do Not Buy,"Waste of money. Does not heat bottle and is very time consuming to charge, for no effect. DO NOT BUY!!!"
3,"Not Kings, But Tribal Chiefs","Interesting book. Good pictures. Be careful however, you cannot compare these kings with other kings, such as Ottoman Emperors, Shah's of Iran, or Emperor's of China. These are mostly tribal chiefs. Title is a bit misused. I knew that when I bought the book, but I bought for the pictures and not the title."
3,Pretty Good Book,"This book is pretty good. The pictures are nice, however there is a lack of pictures and information on alot of african countries. The book covers larely just some of west africa and south africa. There are only like 5 african countries covered in the whole book, which was kinda dissapointing. The book is written at a college level and there are words in there that you may have to have a dictionary at hand to look up the meaning. Overall it was a good work, one I don't regret buying."
1,JF5 IN NAME ONLY,"This is a game that plays but is vastly inferior to the jet fighter 4 ,its not pong but not far from it."
3,Decent intro dictionary,"This is a decent introductory Malay-English/English-Malay dictionary. It's compact, so it's small enough to take on a trip. However, it really could include twice as many words and still remain compact. There are so many basic words you just can't look up in this dictionary: backpack, parrot, gay, boot, silly, to comfort or to console, structure, architect, to commute, to wink, to pinch, to drop... Pretty basic stuff. (And ""stuff"" isn't in there either.)"
3,The book is gorgeous!,"This is one of my favorite books to look at. The pictures are incredible and I have made a few of the appetizers which were fabulous. But as the other review said, most recipes require more knowledge than I have and I try never to make anything too close to guests arriving at my house...too much room to screw up. I think the book is great and I'm glad I own it but for the average person looking for easy-to-do recipes, this book isn't for her."
3,Not for non-professionals,"This book has wonderful photos; the food is dazzling and beautifully presented, but the execution is something else again. If you don't have at least some training, and (most importantly) don't have a slew of helpers, you would be well-advised to steer clear of actually attempting to make this stuff. The work involved will make you too tired to enjoy your own party.Yes, you can make some things ahead and freeze them--but even then, it's hard for some of us to devote an entire weekend (or even an entire day) to cooking. The recipes I tried were both labor-intensive and very time-consuming. I picked up some great ideas for arranging prepared foods and fruit and veggie trays, and I will still enjoy this book as a reference for presenting food, but I doubt if I'll attempt to cook from it again. Whew!"
2,Beware of used books!,"This is a great story, but the book I received is very tattered and well used. More ""used"" than I expected!"
5,wonderful book,Great book for expectant moms and fun to read aloud to children. A delightful story that I've given for gifts on many occasions. It is always a beloved tale with sweet illustrations
5,Best Laptop Cooler Yet,"This is my third laptop cooler and is the best one yet. I've had it about a month and use it for a Thinkpad. What differentiates this product is:1) Collapsible, great for portability2) Runs on either 110 or USB power - the best of both worlds3) 4 USB ports4) adjustable fan speed5) fairly quiet fansI just leave it on my desk so the features I wanted were the 110v and USB ports. It is plastic but no worse than any other plastic model and better than average.I hate the way many of the new coolers are USB powered. If I am mobile I want to maximize battery life, so if anything I use a fan-less cooler. And if I have access to power I prefer to plug it in. Why create more heat to cool it?"
4,"Overall, I was happy with the purchase. No regrets.","Overall, I was happy with the purchase. It included a lot of specfic information which is exactly what I was hoping for. Of course, I didnt agree with every single idea, but I doubt theres many books out there where I would. Its very evident the author has spent a lot of time and effort with the issues at hand, and many of his suggestions are extremely creative and make a lot of sense. I also have a great deal of respect for his views on spending money when starting a business. So, bottom line is I'm happy I bought the book and I feel it was very helpful and inspirational to read the thoughts and suggestions of such an experienced and down to earth farmer. Congrats to him and his family for their success and hopefully I can sustain the same level of will and determination with my ventures. Thank you."
3,Too preachy,"While there is some sage advice on how to do sustainable farming and actually do so as a businessperson rather than as the stereotypical poor farmer there is too much religious preaching going on. Mr. Salatin makes assumptions that those not beholden to a god (especially the christian god) are bound to become reductionist farmers and stray away toward non-sustainable techniques, thus destined to fail. This premise is just NOT true. Until you get page 148, you feel as though you are in church. My advice for anyone interested in this book (don't get me wrong there is good suggestion for becoming a successful farmer), skip to page 148 (chapter on how to acquire land)... while there may be some good anecdotal advice prior to this, it is too preachy. For those who do not mind the drone of the Sunday pulpit go ahead and read from the beginning."
2,Lots of opinions - sparce information,"Don't buy this book if you want to understand farming. This is a book of opinions about the author's experiences with being an entrepenuer. In his opinion you should never buy a new car - dumb or what? You should also go to church. I have nothing against church but I suspect the author recruits his ""interns"" from such settings. He espouses that by having interns he is providing valuable info to future generations. That information must be pretty good because it aint in the book. What is in the book are lots of half cocked ideas about how ""you"" the reader should approach agriculture. I say approach because he never really gets there. I get more good info out of my Farm and Dairy subsciption than this book. Storey publishing has terrific books covering most of the topics in this volume of B.S. If the guy had written this as a ""whodunit"" you'd still be wondering."
1,A waste of money,"I bought this book looking for practical advice on farming. What I got instead was a multi-page, political diatribe of the author's personal opinions on government, science, and the business of agriculture. This book is a basic slap in the face to farmers who till the earth to actually make a living and support their families. The book is so frustrating and infuriating that I couldn't even bear to give it away - it hit the trashbin instead. Don't waste your hard-earned dollars!If you are looking for real, sound, practical advice on making farming your business try ""Starting and Running Your Own Farm Business"" by Aubrey. I found this book to be a much better investment of both time and money."
5,Great Book,Great informative book for anyone wanting to follow their dream and start their own farm! A must in your library! One of the best books out there on this subject!
5,This book was amazing :),"I have heard a lot about Joel Salatin and his way of farming, so i decided to get his book. I believe that his book explained why he is farming this way and what you can do to start. It did take me a while to read it. But it is a great book to turn to for motivation when you feel that you aren't getting anywhere in your farming endeavor."
3,How to earn $20/hr farming organically,"The book contains a lot of great wisdom in terms of:a) how to at least make some money farmingb) doing it in a way that isn't destructive or offensivec) creating differentiated products that people will loveIt also contains a lot of references to the author's pious and puritanical ways (The Lord JHC, Home schooling, etc) which frankly turn me off, being delivered in a slightly condescending manner.Also consider the age of the book, he shuns most anything technological, and I also did not think the author had the ""handy"" aspect covered (he doesn't know how to fix anything mechanical)That being said, I do think this is a good book for those who are considering the trade, might want to do something that isn't a commodity, and care about the sustainability of how they farm."
4,Great Book for the Novice Farmer!,I've read several books on how to start farming but usually they are written from the perspective of someone who has had farms and farming in their family for generations so they don't give you enough detailed information from the perspective of someone who is starting from absolutely nothing. This book does that and more. It gives detailed information about how much money you can make based on the different type of farming you do what it takes to make that type of income on those types of farms. It is very straight forward and easy to read with loads of helpful detail. I would definately recommend this for the novice farmer.
4,The author is a good writer/speaker,"I was actually hesitating between 3 and 4 stars... It's quite an inspirational and well-written book that will definitely give those wanna-be farmers boost of confidence and enthusiasm. It's a good starting point, I think, although I cannot agree with the author on everything.The cons are: he advocates grass-fed approach but doesn't do what he preaches. I've talked to people who have been to his farm and they said he feed his pigs a lot of grain. He feeds grain to his chickens too. I found it kind of hypocrytical...Also, pictures are totally dull and pretty much out of the blue.I would suggest that you check this book out at a library, this way you can save some money. At least that's what I did."
5,A must read for aspiring farmers/ranchers of any scale,"This book is a cornocopia of important information delivered in a fashion that is easy to read and highly entertaining. Once you pick it up you will not want to put it down until you're finished. ""You can farm"" will take you through every scenario one might encounter in the agriculture business and give you the insight necessary to start down the road towards a successful farming/ranching operation. From your metropolitan backyard garden spot to a thousand acre ranch it dispels the myths associated with the industry and gives an honest & candid view from the inside out. Highly recommended for anyone even thinking of starting a farming enterprise."
4,Earthmother hippies beware!,"I wouldnt have Joel Salatin over for dinner, if you know what I mean. He'd be THAT guest. He comes across as a nutcase nightmare straight out of the Great Depression. BUT- Joel Salatin is a genius, and his book was part of what pushed us into farming. If you are trying to figure out if farming, or even homesteading, is for you- then this is the book you need. Especially if you have rosy, idealistic, earthmother fantasies. This book is the equivalent of an ice water bath for people thinking about getting ""out there"". A MUST read, just take a deep breath and two good pinches of salt. You can farm like Joel Salatin, just dont turn into Joel Salatin!"
4,Not a Farmer,"I wanted to learn more about farming in today's world. This book was very helpful. I got the impression that it is a hard life for a small farmer, and impossible for a small old farmer. A small farmer must farm the old fashion way where everything is utilized to improve fertility, or reduce labor and investment, and to grow/raise only enough of high value products that he can be sold in retail markets(local). The farmer and his family must first and formost like the life of a farmer."
3,"Content rich, Service poor","Joel convincingly brings together ""old school"" farming techniques from a plethora of sources into an easy-to-read book. The book is marketed as an entrepreneur's guide to successful farming, but it omits month by month and Year over year spreadsheets. In fact there are no financial statements. And forget requesting them from Joel, he does not return calls. Seems to me that it's missing critical content and service to be an Entrepreneurial Guide."
1,Abandon all hope of joy!,"The author would have us believe that the only way you can make farming work is to abandon anything and everything that doesn't turn a profit. No pets, because they don't earn their own keep? Cull mercilessly? Slash expenses until there is no enjoyment to be found anywhere...but at least you're solvent? No need for health insurance because of the healthy lifestyle? Excuse me, but I've been injured more on the farm than I was in combat as a Marine!Look elsewhere for sound advice!"
5,Great Art,"Wow. I did not expect that a tapestry could be so cool. This is a really nice work of art and it is different from all the other stuff out there. First, it has texture, but not velvet elvis kind of stuff, it is really a woven work of art. This definitely made me think better of tapestries. The next thing I like is that it cant break. I have moved several times and lost anything glass along the way. This wont break. I also like the way the art looks. It just looks better."
2,The Pshychiatrist,"I could not say I liked this story. First of all I had to read this story as homework, and I felt it was to long and complicated. I did read it but I didn't realy understand what the story was about, I could not follow it.Was the psychiatrist insane from the beginning, or did he become insane when he was committed to his own institution? Was he experimenting on everyone including himself on the cause and cure of insanity, even if this meant that the people were striped from their lives in general?"
1,Review on one story,"The only story I read out of this book was ""The Psychiatrist"". It was enough for me. I found it at the beginning to be exciting and then in the middle it fell off of a cliff. It was hard to read and stay caught up the way people were being thrown into the asylum. Who was really crazy here? I do not recommend this story to anyone."
1,"Cheap, cheap, cheap....","You get what you pay for. The video appears to be from a standard camcorder, the sound quality is atrocious, and the physical tapes might be the cheapest-quality I have ever run across. Our 4-year old son has been watching them for about 3 weeks; 1 tape is completely unusable, another is well on its way. I strongly recommend AGAINST the purchase of this tape set, or any tape produced by this same organization.Regretfully,"
4,"This story has several stories in process, to be continued in the next book.","The primary story is about Kara fleeing from Cam because she wanted some independent time before she married. He initially thought she was dead, but as soon as he heard she was alive, five years later, he was able to hunt her and find her. Separate stories begin about Dari fleeing her future husband while learning about and how to stop the evil one. Jana mates with Yorin who takes her to his ice planet.

4,"Rubbermaid 8"" Bronze Celtic Scroll Bracket","Very nice; heavy duty. Was surprised to see that no hardware was included. Not a big deal, but most items of this nature at least have hardware! Otherwise, very happy with the product."
4,Box of crayons learn about being different.,Nice little book about a box of crayons who learn that being different is ok but that they can still work together to complete the picture. This would be great for k-2 classes about working together and being different but still being part of the class.
5,The Crayon Box that Talked,"This is a book that I would recommend to all parents, aunts, uncles,teachers and daycare providers. I bought this book for my grandson and he loves it. He wants to read it every night for one of his bedtime stories. He loves it so much that we sat down and drew pictures of our own representing the crayon box and the uniqueness of each one.It is a must have when teaching children about the diversity of the world. You must buy this book."
5,Book for Children,What a great book for the elementary child or the grandkis (all children matter of fact). Wonderful for today!
1,not so good,"I expected a bit more ......I was disappointed with the contents of the story. The concept of the story was nice, but not very well done."
2,Crayons were diverse but the people were not,"I thought the story had a great message. But I was bothered by the fact that every person in the book had white skin. The message was about the crayons getting along and coming together to make a beautiful picture, so it seemed obvious that the theme of diversity should be carry out across subjects in the book. After all wasn't that the authors's intent? Wasn't the intention to have children relate the experience to their own relationships? I hope a 2nd edition of this book is made containing diverse people...once that is done it will get 5 stars from me."
3,okay,"This cd player is okay. Though I wouldn't recommended for anyone on the go. It's antiskip protectection is great for in the car or a plane ride but, not for bike ride or exercising routine. It's colors are very appealing to the eye but, don't let that grab the attentions of exercise friendly consumers."
1,gpx s7575 home music system,I received as a gift this product from gpx and the volume control NEVER worked properly and I have tried to return this item and no ones knows what to do.Please help.
4,Highly recommended,Very Good. I have learned a lot about managing challenging problems with challenging patients.Cognitive therapists in training can't miss it.
2,"A terrible, terrible version of Flash.","Flash is a great platform, and Flash MX was a great piece of software. This upgrade is terrible, crashing incessantly on Mac OS X. Everyone realized this, so Macromedia quickly rushed out a .01 updater... and it really didn't fix much, if anything. I'm so completely disappointed by Macromedia, especially with the new Adobe products out that are so very much better. If only Adobe made Flash!!! Definately, definately do NOT buy this software, even though it has some neat new features, it's a terrible waste of money for the upgrade. Macromedia needs to realize they made a mistake and FIX IT!"
1,Crash and Burn,"Flash MX 2004 Pro.No doubt about it. So far this morning it has frozen my tablet (what's it doing with serial ports?????), refused to initialise the panel set i just saved, crashed 100% of the time with a single layer on the timeline and very few objects when i try to test the fla (using flash 4 player compat).Not acceptable! Downloading the latest updater has made it worse if anything.I'm just about to reinstall flash 5.Macromedia have tried to make a Visual Studio 2005 type leap here and have failed miserably with the quality control. I'm sure there are heaps of users getting along just fine with it, but i don't care - there are no other apps on my systme that run this way."
1,I downloaded the trial and....,"I downloaded the trial and....It worked fine for 3 or 4 days, then the program crashed and now won't work at all. Any suggestions for something else to work with dreamweaver?"
3,Drawn to extremes,Some $70 and no cover! For Pete's sake!! The material covered is fine but I was expecting a larger format at that price.
5,Love it !,"Very good cd, love the songs music is live, advice and of course Me (the oompa song). Actually, I just like all the songs ! It's a great cd and a must for every music lover."
3,"Nice design, Not the greatest light","I purchased a house which had these lights installed. There are are medium and large ones.I would stay away from the larger onces as they don't put out enough light to cover a large room. I would say the same for the smaller size as they are good for hallways or maybe a laundery room, but I would avoid using them in a normal sized bedroom.I actually broke the glass cover when changing bulbs and I didn't have any luck finding any replacement parts anywhere so I had to purchase a new light completely. Due to the high price, I was looking for new a replacement instead of buying a whole new fixture.This is a nice light overall, but they are not versatile enough to put throughout an entire house."
2,"Good selection, unimpressive recording quality","As a beginning student of bagpipes I find the large selection of songs helpful, but the quality of the recording seems flat. I've tried turning the volume way up, but then it sounds ""tinny"" or ""sharp"" (the volume is lower than for most CDs). And for those who play, the ""throws"" and similar embellishments are not well articulated...the band plays quite fast."
1,Avoid at all costs - terrible sound quality,"The sound of pipes is supposed to stir the soul - not on this CD. This disc is an example of everything that can not be achieved by recording out of doors. The tones are indistinguishable - flat, flat, flat and the side drums often overwhelm the pipes.Put it simply - the recorded rendition of Amazing Grace, always a highlight of a pipes recording, is more boring than a lullabye, and Scotland the Brave is about as thrilling as the Teacup Ride at Disneyworld.Don't waste your money."
1,Fluff. Not Heathenry,"I've been practicing Heathenry for many, many years, and for me this book was a pure waste of time. For a NEWCOMER to heathenry it's worse. It's dangerous. Information is inaccurate at best. The Gods are described almost ridiculously, and the ""meditations"" are as unheathen as rosary beads. Our Troth, by Kvedulf Gunnarson is much better and even THAT needs to be read with a block of salt. I felt the need to write this because, in the case of a ""religious"" book, it's much more important to speak up against books that are off the wall, than say, a pleasure read. The Author herself has a history of rejection among the heathen community, which is a community based around Frith, and ideas of Innangard and Utgard. She, sitting in the Utgard of the community, represents anything BUT heathenry. Her facts are wrong. Her theories are ludicrous, and her overall worldview is disturbing. Avoid this book and this author. Stick with Academic sources. They will get you MUCH farther as a heathen."
1,"Red alert,","Consider this a red flag. Do NOT buy this book. It does not accurately cover ""the Northern Tradition"". It puts Loki (along with his evil sons Fenris & Jormungand) on such a high pedestal that it's as though the author forgot that he is ultimately against the other Gods and Goddesses. That's enough of a mistake on it's own. Overall, if you're interested in properly honoring Our Gods and Ancestors, you should stay away from this book, read and study the folklore, history, and sagas and live an honorable life of truth, virtue, courage, and loyalty. If you feel like you need a guidebook for Germanic Heathenry, I would direct you to Essential Asatru by Diana L. Paxson instead. It is not as absolutely presented as this one tends to be, but offers helpful tips instead of using such a ""black & white"" approach."
3,Good with a grain of salt.,"While I am glad I purchased this book, I think I need to add a note of caution to all the glowing reviews above this one. Gallina has written a very thorough book, with solid descriptions of the different branches of heathenry, but when it comes to describing the Gods and Goddesses I find her a bit fluffy. She is very good at mentioning the lesser known dieties, but this is where the caution comes in: Where we lack lore, she has inserted her own personal experiences, which to me makes this less of an authentic piece of research and more of an unverified personal gnosis.I wouldn't recommend this as a first book on heathenry, because without a little bit of previous experience it would be difficult to work out the fact from the guesswork. However for somebody who wants a well rounded idea of what's out there, and/or who is able to weed out the good bits, it is a very valuable addition to a home library."
4,Rather helpful....,"I thought that this was a pretty good and helpful book. It focused alot on the Godessess though. I would've liked to see more on the Gods but it is rather useful, even if it a bit New Agey."
1,One star because it wouldn't allow zero.,"Purchased 1 1/2ctw (G-H, SI2-I1) from Netaya for x-mas. Arrived well after x-mas even though they confirmed and reconfirmed. When they finally did arrive, the diamonds just looked dull and lifeless compared to the pair I ultimately purchased at a local jeweler. I pulled out a small magnifying glass and quickly saw why - the diamonds had visible carbon spots all over the top. This was a poor quality product. Horrendous service. And a difficult return. A perfect trifecta of disappointment."
5,Absolute Must Have! Greatest Classical/Opera CD of All Time,"This cd is honestly the most beautiful entrancing music one will ever hear. This is truly Preisner's masterpiece in my opinion. I saw the movie on T.V., but they didnt show the credits so i went and rented it just to find out the name of the person who created this otherwordly music...it's that good. This film itself isn't much to talk home about, but this cd is SO worth buying. BUY IT!!!!! Unless you cant hear...you will love it!"
4,TOO SHORT TOO BAD,"I have just received my copy of this CD from Amazon France and like most of Preisners work it is stunningly beautiful. I am on my second playing of this CD to get my value out of it (not that it matters as it can be played over and over again without getting bored ) as it is only 30 minutes in duration. 4 stars even though content is 5 out of 5. Fabulous soundtrack and movie. If you enjoyed the soundtracks to Blue and Red which I hope to receive any day now from Amazon.com you will love this album. According to the cover notes on the cd the soundtrack to White is also available but I have not been able to find it. I have checked Amazon in Germany, France, U.K and U.S but it is not listed. The Philarmonic Choir of Silesia will numb the senses and the Great Orchestra of Katowice is pretty good as well."
5,Authentic Village Gypsy Music,"This is a tremendously valuable CD which contains field recordings from several Hungarian villages of authentic gypsy music (even background sounds are included). It is the ""real thing"". The cover photo is of Bela Kodoba and his Gypsy Ensemble from Transylvania (Erdely). He is considered among the best of traditional Hungarian and Translylvanian musicians. The credits are not clear in the liner notes but I believe the Transylvanian music is played by Bela Kodoba & his band. Anyone who loves this style of music should buy this CD. Erika Borsos (erikab93)"
5,Historical Gem,"In her book GAMBLER'S WIDOW Mary Lou Hagen has crafted a compelling story of the Old West.When widow Maggie DuPree travels to West Texas to help her ailing sister she encounters a world of excitement, danger and an unexpected romance with a dashing cavalry officer Captain Chance Richards. Through the eyes of European immigrants eager to create a new life for themselves and Indians desperate to hold onto their way of life the reader is swept back to a time when this country was both old and new. Ms Hagen presents the defeats and the victories, the heartbreak and the joys, as well as the challenges and the rewards of life on the Western frontier in a realistic yet personal way. I highly recommend it.Elysa Hendricks - author of Shadow Moon"
3,Collection,This is part of the original Impulse 'New Wave' Series originally issued in the early sixties. It is one of 4 that I needed to fill out my set of A-1 through A-100 (A-44). While a noble attempt and touching gesture by Gordon Jenkins to showcase his wife I personally would not have purchased this album based on the content. It swings but lacks the energy and hunger I look for in the blues.
3,good if they fit,"well i ordered these for my 1992 ford f250 because my friend has them on his ranger and they work very nice. for the money they are a great deal but if you are getting these for an f250 make sure your truck is light duty, if you have leaf springs on you ttb these are not for you"
3,Hollow,"Busiek, whom I only know from his Conan adaptations, and from the praise of `Marvels' (never read it). Seems to be writing for another era, with a paragraphs worth of exposition occurring between a punch thrown and a punch landed. And Perez's art , while technically fine, and highly detailed, lacks emotion and weight. It all reads like something that was pumped out by the comic-tron 2000. All sizzle, no steak. I wont be back for Vol. 2"
4,Helpful but misnamed,"This book is an overview of the different kinds of living situations for seniors who need help with daily activities. It describes different types of facilities, such as retirement communities, assisted living, and nursing homes, and includes checklists of questions you may want to ask if you are evaluating a place for yourself or a loved one. It does not contain any information specific to any part of New Jersey. It doesn't have listings of facilities. A better title would be ""Senior Living & Eldercare Options in the US""."
5,ALL IN THE PLAN,"IT IS REFRESHING TO HEAR AN INSPIRATIONAL ARTIST WITH A UNIQUE, ORIGINAL STYLE. THE ENTIRE CD IS GREAT. THERE IS SOMETHING ON THIS CD FOR EVERYONE. LAVIAS' MUSICAL TALENT IS AWESOME. I FEEL THAT WE WILL BE HEARING GREATER THINGS FROM HIM IN THE FUTURE."
5,"""SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE!!!","""ALL IN THE PLAN"", IS INSPIRING TO EVERYONE, PROMISES HOPE, AND INSTILLS FAITH IN THOSE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR WAY OR LACK THE WILL TO GO ON.THIS AWESOME AND POWERFUL CD ALSO PROMOTES BROTHERLY LOVE, MOTIVATING US TO ENCOURAGE RATHER THAN TO JUDGE ONE ANOTHER.THE TITLE SONG, AND OTHERS ON THE TRACK, HELP US TO UNDERSTAND THAT GOD IS IN FULL CONTROL OF OUR LIVES, AND REMINDS US THAT IF WE DO ""HIS"" WILL, WE CAN OBTAIN NOTHING BUT THE ULTIMATE!!!"
2,"Uneven collection of short stories, some good, most bad","This book contains 11 short stories from various science fiction authors. All stories take place in a post nuclear war setting.Most of the stories are incredibly shallow, such as a story by Ian Watson called ""When Idaho Dived"" in which an old man tries to convince his tribesmen that there is a metal submarine that will take them to food through the sand.Not really enough good stuff here to make it worth more than the 50 cents I spent on it at a yard sale but Gregory Benford's ""To the Storming Gulf"" gets an honorable mention."
3,Some assembly required......,"I found some pros and cons with this book. I had some ""hopefully it's not just me...but were some of those intructions hard to figure out for you?"" moments. Some of the patterns were very unique and fun, and some were things that I didn't care for, however the ones that didn't appeal to me, seemed to outnumber the ones that did.One thing I did really like about this book, is that after every pattern it has a section titled ""other yarns to try"" and shows how you can vary the look by changing the type of yarn or colors used, I like to do that, and appreciated the pointers.Overall, I was not deeply impressed with this book, but it did yield some crochet projects that I wanted/did try."
2,Inadequate Instructions,"I bought this book for the Snow Bunny cable scarf that my daughter wanted. The instructions are brief to the point of being meaningless. Maybe if you already know how to do cable crochet, they make sense, but they are not like the cable crochet instructions I have found on line after being frustrated with the book. Even the beginning seems wrong: she says chain 27 stitches, of which two are for the turn, but then the next row says you have 24 stitches. So it should be chain 26, as far as I can tell. The other patterns may (or may not) be fine, but this was the one I tried."
5,an everyone book,"Awesome Dad, I am very proud of you. Though cooking runs through the bloods, this book is always in the kitchen. Very helpful and informative. If any parent is reading, this books is definately something for you, and your kids living on their own. You'll be glad you purchased this."
4,NOT THAT BAD AT ALL!!!!!!,"i bought this game like a week ago, and to be honest im enjoying every aspect of it...graphics are not the greatest but not the worst either...when it comes to gameplay, i have no complaints at all...hadoukens( fireballs or projectiles) are really fast, in compare to ANY of the streetfighters games outhere, and i really liked that..capcom characters are tone down to a seriousness, not like the alpha series....the sf alpha series makes the characters look like fisher-price figures in my own opinion!!.its cool you can pick from vega,balrog,earthquake,(big guy from samurai showdown) and mr karate. the fighters handle good and powerful and definitelly ( I LOVE THE HEAVEN STAGE WITH THE LITTLE ANGELS!!!!!!!!)never seen that on any game!!! A++ TO SNK...!!!!!"
1,Was a huge fan of Street Fighter 10 years ago...but man its aged in 10 years,"I felt it didn't do a justice to the hardware in the XBOX. The graphics looked really dated, gameplay had really aged."
1,Crap!!,"So I sit here playing my xbox and I glance at the SVC:Chaos game box and I wonder, ""why did I buy that game??"" Ladies and Gentle men this will be a very short review,this game is GARBAGE!! I am a long standing 2d game fan and SNK is almost the lone survivor of the 2d age. So it saddens me when they release a game like this which is such an obvious rushed and uncared for release just to satisfy contractual demands they had with Capcom. LOW RES graphics and I mean sub par neo geo graphics....sound is even worse.Skip it...buy Capcom vs Snk: EO 2...muuucchh better better everything... SNK really dropped the ball...after playing Guilty Gear this game jus would not cut it"
5,Great thinking fun for kids!,"This is a great deck of cards for 3+, it was very easy for my daughter to pick up the matching concept, and then eventually the listening concept of the game. There is a main object on each card within a some other objects, and the main objects are not always exact matches (white horse/black horse, 2 different chairs, shells, etc.) which keeps them on their toes. I have found it for 4.99 at Stop and Shop and bought for as many of my daughters friends birthdays as possible, it is terrible to see these sellers are marking it up so absurdly."
2,Mine broke in 2 years,[...] Would have given this a 5 star except it only lasted about 2 years. The mesh screen cup that holds the beans had a leg detached in less than 1 year (but it was still useable). I concur with the other reviewer in that this machine needs a better construction. The last time I used it the blade cut through the mesh screen cup & the ball bearings came out. I hate to say this but maybe a Japanese (or Taiwanese?) made soy extracter would be better constructed than this Korean made one?I am in the market for another soy extractor & I won't be buying this one.
3,Great book with a difficult language,"This is a great book, however, author's use of ""difficult"" language makes it a hard reading for students. The point of this book should entirely be to emphasize on facts, rather than to showcase author's verbal capabilities."
3,Used in MBA program,"I did not think this book was that useful in that it does not reach any techniques but rather it allows you to glean ideas from mistakes that companies have made. It presents different cases from the real world but coming from a background of no marketing experience, I did not find this technique all that useful."
5,Love Caillou!,"My Daughter isn't quite 3 yet but LOVES Caillou, bought this for her DVD player for our long plane trip, worked great to entertain her!"
1,Broken,I purchased this DVD for my neice for Christmas and she opened the package and the DVD was broken. Will never purchase from Amazon again.
5,Caillou's fun outside,"My Grandchildren ages 4, 3 & 1 are all glued to the tv when Caillou is on. I love Caillou too."
3,Nice but not the best,"This is a really nice tea and I love the beautiful packaging. I wanted to love everything else about it but I kept tasting a slightly sour note in some cups... I thought it might be the milk I'd used, but many brands and quarts of milk later, I still notice it sometimes. It is still really good tea but I will probably go back to Twinings English Breakfast after this box as it is just as good and a bit cheaper, albeit with less attractive packaging. I also ordered the Harney & Sons English Breakfast tea sachets and those do not have the occasional sour aftertaste but are a bit more expensive for an everyday tea and not quite as good as Kusmi teas for special occasions."
2,Not the quality I expected,"I have no problems with the vendor supplying the brushes in a timely fashion -- but I must admit I was disappointed by the brushes. I thought I was buying -- in bulk -- the same brush that I usually buy at my local Menards store. Unfortunately, they aren't quite the same thing. The locally purchased brushes have a plastic spine internal to the brush which makes them a lot sturdier. These don't, so they are a bit harder to use."
4,adequate and inexpensive,If you will be going through lots of disposable foam brushes this is a great deal. I found them to be of no lesser quality than those I have purchased locally and quite a bit less expensive per brush.
5,Very annoyed,"I'm adding my plea. It's bad enough that die hard 'Blue' fans are denied the rest of the series but where is the incentive for 'Blue' virgins to buy the first four seasons when there is little chance of completing the set, it's madness and almost insulting. Please release five to twelve so we can all send you our money and get on with our lives....please?!"
5,"Not just season 5, but 6 as well!!!","Just like season five wraps up season four's cliffhanger, season six ties into the end of five. The first five gut-wrenching episodes from season six are some of the best TV ever produced, let alone from the series itself.I have got nothing against other shows being released in DVD form - after all, they too have their fans. But why are the honchos at FOX dragging their feet on this fine show? NYPD Blue fans are a legion who deserve their quality time with Sipowitz and his cohorts.On a final matter, speaking for myself, if cost is an issue, I have nothing against a bare-bones package being released as long as the 15th Precinct continues to see the light of day.Do the right thing, FOX. Don't be like a twitch skell who needs their balls busted. Reach out and solve this case."
5,Just curious...,Can we at least find out the reason WHY it's taking so long for NYPD Blue Season 5 to be released? I can't afford to buy the whole series all at once & now we're stuck at the end of Season 4 with nothing to look forward to. Is this some kind of conspiracy to force people to buy the whole series rather than season by season?
3,NYPD BLUE SEASON 5,LET ME START BY SAYING THAT NYPD BLUE IS THE BEST TV SERIES SINCE M*A*S*H! AND I ALREADY HAVE ALL OF THE M*A*S*H SERIES AND I WANT TO HAVE TO THE COMPLETE NYPD BLUE SERIES SO THEY NEED TO HURRRRRRY UP!!!
4,What's the holdup?,"Anyne know WHY seasons 5 thru 12 haven't seen the light of DVD yet? Some kinda legal hassle? An actor demanding too much $$$? See, I started watch NYPD Blue well WELL after the 5th season so I was glad too see 1 to 4 to catch up.As we last lef off Andy shot a badguy who was blackmailing his partner... or did he? I'm sure I can find a complete senirio on, say, Wikipedia, but I wanna be surprised! Anybody wanna fill me in? Not on the continuing Blue saga but and the red tape that's keeping the remaining seasons out of our reach?"
5,Blue,Easily one of the best police dramas ever made. Homicide: Life on the Street is number 1 but NYPD is almost tied for first.
5,""" LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG, OVER DUE""","Not only is season five ""LONG OVER DUE"", So is Season 6,7,8,9,10,11 and 12.So ,Come on ""STEVEN BOCHCO,DAVID MILCH"" Lets get with the programNYPD Blue - Season 5"
5,Thanks amazon.com,"Id just like to publically thank Amazon for getting NYPD Blue seasons 5 through 12 out there. I know, like me, there are fans out there that have been waiting for this for years, and I'm anxious to watch when my computer gets back up to specs, or I get a new one since mine does not work. I have not watched it yet, but thanks for these great shows through amazon instant video and prime instant video."
4,Pretty good,"I read this book several years ago while the plot of the television series was still young, season 2 or 3. The book is consistant with that timeline, which has been screwed up, spun around, and dumped upside-down since then. Around the same time I also read the Ru Emmerson books, and I do like this book much better than those as they are not consistant to the Xena timeline/plot and cannot stand alone-you would have to read the first and then the second and so on to understand everything that's going on. This is a stand-on-its-own kind of book and has a Xena-like plot to it. One problem that seems consistant to me in the published Xena novels is lack of emotion. This book held more emotion than the Ru Emmerson books.If you want a good, stand on its own Xena adventure, this is the book for you. If you want a Xena adventure the provokes serious emotions and feelings, as the show itself often did, you may want to consider online fan fiction."
1,Doesn't capture Xena Gabrielle characters,This book did a poor job of conveying the essences of Xena's and Gabrielles characters-especially compared with the Ru Emerson books. In this book Gabrielle does too much simpering and is too much a little girl-no thought is given to what makes Gabrielle and Xena a team. And the sexual tension between them is totally absent-this book seems more geared towards the young male audience than both the tv show and the Ru Emerson books-which I highly recommend-especially if you didn't like this one.
3,It was ok...,"Better than Ru Emerson's books. This book makes you feel that Xena and Gabby are friends and that Xena is developing as a character (with emotions towards other people), not just a paper-cut-out of a warrior."
3,Xena and Gabrielle face Cerberus almost to death,The writter knew next to nothing about Xena. In the book she showed tonns of emoition. He also spelled a coulple things wrong. He wrote Argos instead of Argo. He also spelled charkum chakra. I think if he wants to write another book he should learn more about Xena: Warrior Princess.
5,This film explains so much!,"I read 'Military Brats' when it was first published and bought a copy for my brother and one for a friend. The book and film explains so much about our lives.My wonderful Nouasseur AB reunion group showed the film in our hospitality suite, thank you Sharon Ray Renno. There were maybe 40 people in the room and we were all laughing and crying. At certain points in the film, there was a huge gasp of recognition from the crowd. It was a high point of the reunion, we talked about the film the entire weekend.You must see this film, if you are a Brat or love a Brat."
5,what a guy !! i never knew,"Niels was the Man !! i just picked this book 'totally out of the blue'.glad i did, fascinating history and great science.."
2,Not very readable,"I bought this for my husband, who wanted to read a biography of Niels Bohr. Apparently there are very few available; he decided to try this one; he reports that it is not very readable even though the author knew Bohr personally. If you absolutely must read this, borrow it from a library, even via inter-library loan if you have to."
3,It does the job.,"Works fine, reads quickly. I guess the quality is not in top, as the first one that I have received could not switch to Fahrenheit. The second one works, we'll see for how long."
5,Prime Rib temp. test!,"I got this right before the holidays.(my previous 2 insta reads were dead at the same time, no less! Couldn't even calibrate them) This product did the job like a pro!"
3,MIU Digital Cooking Thermometer,"Thermometer displays temp after 8 - 10 seconds, as advertised.It reads temps in Celsius or Fahrenheit, with the scale chosen by sliding a small switch. After less than ten uses the slide switch would give only the Celsius reading.I have received a replacement (hassle-free) and hope the holds up better."
4,"nice thermometer, but","mine only reads up to 302 degrees, not 500 as it says in the description. also, the tiny little lever to turn it off and on hurts my thumb a bit. But, it has a nice big readout, its fast, non roll and has a clip to clip to a pocket."
1,"Had 2, neither worked","I ordered this thermometer and when I got it, it would not turn on. I checked the battery and it was corroded. Amazon sent me a new one very quickly, but it also did not work, so now I am just going get my money back."
2,"Why not say 10,000F ?","Primary point to make: this is most certainly NOT an instant 'temperature sensing' thermometer. Maybe you can visually 'read' this in an instant, but this unit does not reflect the temperature of whatever you're probing at a speed anyone would consider quick. Be prepared to have your hand hovering over the hot oil, whatever, for blistering seconds while you wait for the numbers to roll up to the final reading.Second point: anyone else notice that the product title calls this a 500F thermometer, but the actual product labelling, as seen in the second photo (and in person), indicates this only goes to 450F ? If we're going to allow vendors to make up their own numbers, why not call this an Absolute 0 to 10,000F thermometer?"
4,Road Trip music,"""This is for all the nights you sent me driving home to an empty house full of people"". IS THE most amazing song. I can relate so well to these lyrics, ""I'm not the wall, it's what you sit around waiting for...."". and to "" Even with the lights out i can still see these things""..The rest of the CD is good too. My favorites besides this song are ""Cyclical Insomnia"", and ""Redundant"""
3,Only one thing to do,"Suspense and fear. Imagine everything you hold dear is in danger and you cannot trust anyone...UGH! Well written. Had me at the first page, then it was suddenly 4am and I was still reading."
2,"good idea, bad execution","The attraction of this door was the ability to keep our local raccoon out of the cat food (and the house) while leaving the cats free access. For about three weeks, this was indeed what happenned.Our local raccoon, however, seems to have an advanced degree in mechanical engineering.First thing to go was the tunnel connecting the front and back pieces. I found it in the driveway the first time. The second time, it was gone altogether.Once the tunnel was gone, the raccoon started getting his paws into the mechanism. He was able to figure out how to push open the cover that held the door in place. Each time I replaced it, he'd try a new method. Finally, only four months after getting the door, the thing is in pieces. The front and back panels are still connected to the door frame, but the flap, the lock, and all other pieces have been dismantled.Four months is a bit short a half-life. I'd try this again if they had a version that was truly raccoon-proof."
1,Does not keep strays out or my cat in,My cat can get out of this door. What is worse is a stray cat can get into this door which has caused problems. I have had to block this door and am looking for something that really works.
2,No other word to describe this book...,Boring.... I bought this book because it came soooo recommended but I couldn't wait to pass it on to someone else. I talked with one of my friends that also bought it. She totally agreed with me. It is just boring. I don't know why this book was republished. Mrs. Schaeffer has other books that are better!
1,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this book. I was hoping it would be full of ideas and inspirations for me as a homemaker. However, it didn't really cover a lot of ground and I found I began skimming each chapter to see if there was going to be some ""meat"" somewhere, something for me to really grasp hold of and use. In the end I only found a couple of practical ideas.I also did not enjoy her writing style, lots of aside comments which became really annoying."
2,Blah,"Has to have pressure to operate. So, don't think you can just set it somewhere and let it vibrate, needs to have a certain amount of pressure against it."
4,Great for Dental students too!!,I am a first year dental student and neuroanatomy was part of our anatomy corse. I found this book very quick and easy to read. I will use this book when studying for my national board exams!! After all dentists need to know all about those cranial nerves! This book was well worth the money.
5,"Poppy, the best gothic horror writter ever!!",I have read most of Poppy's books and I have to say that she is the has to be one of the best gothic horror writers of all times! And I think that Lost Souls has to be her best. I love how it goes. In fact I can relate to the charter Nothing. She really gets it down on how some teens really feel on life. You gotta love Poppy.
5,Deeply disturbing,"I had to read a book a long time ago for a report at school, (I chose Courtny Love)and the author that had my subject was Poppy Z. Brite. I thought the way she explained and retold the story of some one's life was very unique. Thus I looked for another book. Being that I love books on vampires and the abnormal I thought she might have a good twist to some old fiction. And she did. She's one of the most creative in her time and I love all of her books. She makes the abnormal normal. She is a genious and has guts to bring things that people never consider out in the open and makes them apart of you. I may be in my teens, but I read a heavy part, so far she is the only author that I will fallow from now on."
4,Pretty darn good,She is one of the few authors that have trully touched on homoerotic. I have read all of Poppy Z. Brites books and love them all. I like the characters personality and the plot was interesting. Another writer that is right on the mark for homoerotica is d.n.simmons
5,Addictive...absorbant...,I read this book in under a day...it's characters have such rich stories...it sucks you in and makes you really feel for the characters...it makes you wish you were in the story and living their lives...definitely recommended for everyone...
3,I Really Tried to Like It.......,"For the real effort I made to enjoy this novel, I will give it 3 stars rather than the 2 that it deserves. (Let's call it a 2.5) The descriptions of the edges of the French Quarter, New Orleans were actually quite good - and the writing flowed quite nicely. However, the dialogue was little more than adolescent smack - and the plot's substance left much to be desired. There were blatant shortcomings in both suspense and horror. It is ironic that, given this novel's premise, I had originally anticipated devouring all of Ms. Brite's work. Unfortunately, since reading ""Lost Souls,"" I have had not so much as an inkling of desire to even taste another of her books."
5,excelnt work,Poppy Z. Brite is a masterful storyteller. She has created people so in depth that you can instantly fall in love or hate them in an instant. This is a must read for any erotic horror fan.
5,Beautiful Dark Mesmerizing...,"I was absolutely captivated by Poppy Z. Brite's exquisite narrative... the way she intricately describes things is totally amazing. Her characters are so amazingly real and almost tangible at times. I have falled in love with the beautifully tragic Nothing... *sigh* This was the first of her books I have read and I have passed it around to all of my friends and now I am finishing up DRAWING BLOOD, another fantastic novel. Poppy Z. Brite kicks ass.. she makes Steven King, Clive Barker, even Anne Rice appear like Candyasses next to her horrifying literature, which is very chilling and terrofying at times!!! I luhv it!"
3,"Totally gay, but the story is good","The story hooks you in, and then gets into detailed homosexual sections. Sadly, when it got to the male female sex ""scenes,"" aside from a detailed rape scene, it doesn't give you any of the details at all. Just ""they had sex"" (basically).All that aside, I had to finish the book, I had to find out what happened. The ending was good, and complete as well. Nothing where you're left with, ""yeah, but what happened to ...""I support gay rights, gay marriage, etc, but I can do without details that paint a picture in my mind, or actually seeing it happen. If someone told me Poppy Z Brite wrote a book and the gay stuff isn't in it, I'd be interested in reading it. Otherwise, I doubt I'll pick up another book of hers."
1,"No action, no mystery, boring characters","This book is certainly dark, which is usually a good thing, but it did nothing for this book at all. There's a boy named Nothing that has sex with any and all of his friends and does drugs. Also, an abuser character that beats up his woman, a psychic boring character named Ghost, and 3 vampires that aren't very interesting. People do drugs, kill each other, kill their best friends, sleep with their fathers, some people get pregnant, some run away from home...yawn. If this book is supposed to be interesting because it's dark and shocking, I say that isn't enough, there still has to be an entertaining plot. I didn't care who killed who in this book, the characters were all so unlikable and one dimensional. I couldn't finish it. I like dark fantasy and horror, but only if there is a plot. I'm not interested in reading about people's screwed up lives, even if their are vampires involved."
1,This is so bad it's not even funny,"This is what you get when you put a high school kid behind a computer -- some wild fantasy about how cool it is to have sex w/ men and (!) women (ooooh) while drinking (!!) lots (!!!) of alcohol (ooooooh again). The characters are pretty cool too, if you're 14 that is, and as a teen you won't even mind the inconsistencies, the bloated language, and you'll probably think violence is pretty cool too. And oh yes, the vampires. Vampires are way cool to. Let's dress up like them and prentend we're drinking blood. If you still suffer from acne and adolescent mood swings and the whole world is out to get you, read this book. If, on the other hand, you are older than 18, forget it and get a *real* novel instead."
4,Well Writen and Depressing!,"If you want to feel bummed out and disillusioned then you will want to read Lost Souls. The book is well written in every way. Unfortunately, the moral of the story seems to be the following: no matter what, people will always suck you dry. Not the most uplifting theme. Art is not always supposed to be uplifting or happy. But, it would be nice to see something more productive from an author with such immense talent. If you are thinking of buying Lost Souls and you already have The Cure, Bauhaus, and Joy Division's Closer CD in your collection, then DON'T buy it. Instead, buy Oasis' Morning Glory CD or Steve Miller's greatest hits '74-78."
3,Disappointing. Brite tried too hard.,"I read Wormwood prior to Lost Souls. I'd heard raves about the both of them, so I was anxious to read. When I thought that Wormwood showed some promise, I eagerly bought Lost Souls. It wasn't _bad_, but it's definitely overrated. Poppy Z. Brite is not the 'Goddess of Goth' that another viewer proclaimed. The whole book was just too over the top with its GAF factor. I think it would appeal more to prepubescent sp00ky kids."
4,"Has its faults, but not bad","My main problems with this book are a) its formless, wandering plot, and b)the utter lack of intelligent female characters in *all* of Poppy's books. The vampires are barely characterized at all except for Nothing and Christian. In fact, the onlycharacters who get more than a vague description are Steve and Ghost, who are really the sole reason I read this book over and over. I LOVE them, especially Ghost. They have the most beautiful, bizarre relationship (they're more than friends, not quite lovers, almost brothers) and are, to be honest, the only truly likeable people in this book (yes, even Steve, who can be a jerk at times). I wish Ms. Brite would write more books about *them*. -Twilight"
2,Maybe I just don't get it,"I'm not into Goth and I'm pretty sick of vampires, but I've heard so much about Poppy Brite and how much of a revolutionary writer she is that I've read all four of her books so far. Still, I wonder what it is I'm missing. None of her books have impressed me too much, but this particular story didn't captivate me at all. The events came together so perfectly and coincidentally that fate seemed to play a bigger role than the characters in the story. Ms. Brite's language is beautiful, and her images are stunning, but when it comes down to story (at least with this novel), she didn't put enough in to the book."
3,What's the big deal?,"Her sentences meander around and really go nowhere. Most of the descriptions are overdone....too much kudzu. Apart from the kid named Nothing, none of these characters were interesting or sympathetic. I put it down after 300 pages."
2,Not too impressed,"I read this and wasn't too impressed by it . I still prefer Stephen King, Anne Rice and Laurell K Hamilton to this author. I don't know it was as if the author was trying too hard or something , just couldn't keep interested in it."
5,Best book I've read in a while.,"This book was breath taking. I'm not one to sit down and read for long periods of time, but this book pulls you down into the depths of its tale. The charactors, such as the lovely Nothing, welcome you to live their tale with them. Read this book, you will swallow it whole."
5,Great Book But. . . . .,"While i enjoyed this story very much, it's a little bold to even compare this author to anne rice (who is much better) anne's book had an orginality that this book lacks (vampire rock star, new orleans: ring a bell?) this book is an entertaining read and is worth purchasing, it is now amoung one of my faverites but does not surpass the chronicles in anyway."
5,Lost Souls is the best book ever written,"There's nothing I can say that hasn't been said before, this book is so wonderful. I fell in love with all the characters, I felt like I knew them, I felt like I was right there with them. I have read it 3 times, I just can't find anything to read that compares...I'm just wishing for a sequel. :)"
5,Anne Rice watch out!!!!!,"The characters in this book are so real, that if you go to the French Quarter in New Orleans you find yourself looking for Christians bar. And how wonderful it would be if they really existed. I can see us walking down The Village smoking clove cigarettes, howling at the moon while drinking Chartruese & feeding on those who cross our path. But I do believe that they exist... in us. We are those people you cross the street to avoid because we have the balls to be ""different"". Sometimes we all feel like Nothing. Like there's no place where we belong but, then you read a book like this & you realize that their are more Lost Souls walking the earth just like you."
1,horrifing,"I do not know what it is about this book that I hate...perhaps it is the adolescent manner of writing, the horny-teenage-I'm-too-immature-to-handle-sex-scenes homoerotica. Or maybe I do know why this book reads like a fourteen year old wrote it."
2,An unexpected driving force,"Although Ms. Brite redefines the vampire lore in her own unique way, this book seems to be carried from start to finish by the twisted nature of the relationship between it's characters. A quality read must include characters that you can identify with. Personally, I found it hard to relate myself to a culture of incestuousness and rampant homosexuality. Not to say that Vampires have to play by the rules of normal society, but this book leaves not a single character untouched by it's sicked amoral bite.I was expecting something along the lines of the film ""Near Dark"". Unfortunatly this book is nothing of the sort. My recommendation is that for quality vampire reading, stick to Ann Rice. Sweet dreams princess."
1,Did nothing for me,"Unpleasent and unsympathetic characters doing nasty things to one another do not a horror tale make. Let me give this much as an example - a self-pitying rapist is the ""tragic hero"" of this sordid story. I could not finish it."
4,"Why you should read ""Lost Souls"" by Poppy Z. Brite","I don't expect you to read this book just because some (most probably bribed) person you've never met has told you to. I want you to read it simply because it's one of the best novels you will read in a long time.So, why should you read it? Well, it has a plot that twists and turns like a snake with a hernia, fascinating, multi-faceted characters, and two contrasting plot strands that eventually become interweaved. What more could you need?! A classic vampire novel, it's for all those out there who have ever suspected they might not fit in; and anyone who loves the atmosphere of New Orleans!Go and buy this book now! You won't regret it."
1,Extremely disappointing,"I found this story to be too confused and busy. It meanders between characters until it brings them all together later on in the book, but it just seems like the brief moments of actual ""action"" are just huge build-ups of anticipation with an anti-climatic little *pop* of dénouement. In short, nothing's happening to keep me interested! The characters are fantastic, the author's descriptive powers are beyond compare, but there's just no story there.I tend to like a good vampire fic to keep me shivering for a night or two. This one has kept me groaning night after night trying to finish it for almost three weeks (an exhaustively long time for me to finish a book). Ghost, Steve, Nothing, Christian, and Brite's version of the Stygian triplets are all rich, wonderful characters. Now if only she'd done something with them....Disappointing, especially after all the good I'd heard about this author."
1,sullen teenager angst...yada yada yada,"this was not an enjoyable read. i forced myself to finish, hoping that it would get better. it never did...it just got longerrr and longerrrrr....bleh!"
3,Are you vampiresque tonight?,"Well, the athmosphere is the right shade of black, and I love the charachters of Ghost and Nothing...but what's is all about?Too much gore, too many unpleasant charachters, and the gloom isn't even justified by ancestral lore. Yeah, maybe vampire stories just aren't my cup of tea. If you want a very original vampire story, rooted in mythology, read Burying the shadow of Storm Constantine"
5,Great Book,I loved this book! Poppy Z. Brite creates great characters and plot to get you into the story. I highly recommend this to book!
3,Put on the Bauhaus for background music,"I read this back in 1992 when it first came out. All I really remember is that it's a weird, homoerotic vampire novel that's not so scary, as it is creepy and atmospheric. If you dig goth style, music, night clubs, kinky sex, and bloodfeasts, then you will probably enjoy this book.What I mostly remember about this book is that it turned me on to the joys of drinking Chartreuse. For that alone, it was worth the read."
4,It was better when I was 16,"This used to be my favorite book when I was in school. When I first read it I thought it was cutting edge, but now that I'm older it seems kind of forced. Don't get me wrong, I love Miss Brites work, I just don't think that this is her best. This was her first novel, so she's grown a lot in her writing, and I don't think she cares about writing what people expect anymore.As far as vampire books go, this is one of the best that I have read. When I was younger, I felt very akin to Nothing (What teenage freak doesn't?) and I thought it would be fun to have my real dad be a vampire, (although I definitely wouldn't sleep with him) and what a fun life it would be, just drifting and partying across the country. I'd recommend reading this before any of Poppy's other works--Once you see what she's capable of, this will lose most of its effect."
3,shameless goth plug,"Although the story itself was quite interesting a well-written, I couldn't help but be annoyed with all the direct references to goth culture - i.e. Bauhaus t-shirts, listening to the Cure, etc...to me it felt as if it was some sort of literary commercial for goth culture/products. Compared to other books I've read by Poppy Z. Brite, this one seemed really amateur. The second time I read this book I was able to appreciate the story more, but I still can't help but feel that someone has found a unique sub-culture and made an attempt to put it in a shiny digestable package."
5,Beautiful,"I loved it, i still love it, I picked up this book and just could not put it down. Few books i read from front to back on the same day because i could not put it down. The characters were so well written i could picture each character as i read. Also, the plot was very well constructed, as i was not confused by nothing happening ar too much happening with no exlplanations. While this book may not be for the weak at heart or more prudish, it is definatly a must read if you are into vampires, fiction or just a great story."
2,Lost Souls Indeed,"I don't understand why this book was praised over. The characters (especially Nothing, Steve, and Anne) had no sense at all. You can't relate to any of them due their actions of stupidity all through-out the book. The only thing that gave this book substance was the vampires that followed Zillah around and the music that was mentioned. Other than that, how can this be a gothic novel? All it is, is an excuse for some sex fetish that people have and no creative way of expressing it. If you want twisted sex fetishes, read about the gay characters in a clive barker book! At least he's more inventive."
3,Something is definately lacking......,"Lost Soul's is a well written, highly stylised piece of literature. However, it just seems to lack what virtually every other horror novel published these days lacks..........HORROR When will we ever be graced with a book that is truely terrifying. By the looks of things, sadly perhaps never... I dont recall a time when i was actually frightened during ""Lost Souls"". thats not to say its bad, quite the opposite. I just wish someone will actually come out with something that truely makes me shiver."
3,OK Not Great,This cookbook is organized by vegetable. I would have liked something a little more creative in layout. For instance a book where they organize by cooking method. The recipes don't seem all that novel either. I haven't used it yet.
4,The story of the Smiths continues...,"If you enjoyed Stepping on the Cracks, you may have wondered what happened to Gordy. Here is the book that will tell you. As he tries to build a ""tough"" reputation, Gordy finds that his relatives can be just as stubborn as he is. He realizes that you can't judge people by what they look like, and friends aren't always who you expect them to be."
4,Following My Own Footsteps,"Gordy was in 6th gradewhen he moved away from Colledge Hill.He moved because his father went to jail for beating him.so,they moved away from Colledge Hill.They moved to Grandville to live with their Grandma.At Grandma's Gordy learns how to be nice.I liked it,i think you will to. Following My Own Footsteps reminds me of Tallahasee Higgens,another book M.D.Hahns.The likeness is they both move to reletives.I give it 4 stars(on a scale of 1-5)There's alot of cussing."
4,Good Produce,"After reading all the mixed reviews, I finally decided to order the Bed-Xtender. I was concerned that it might not fit since it was listed over $125 less than a local parts place wanted plus $25 installation fee. I agree the instructions leave much to be desired, unless you read french, but if you looked at the pictures along with the french instructions, it soon makes sense. It probably took me an hour to assemble the kit which included all the parts including the latches. I don't know why they want to sell you the latches separately when you order the bed xtender when they are included in the kit. Anyway, I fully recommend the product and if you have any mechanical abilities at all you shouldn't have a problem, just take your time and think it through. I have assembled some of my children's toys and gifts that offered a greater challenge!"
1,Incomplete,"No mention of ME (CFS) which is very common (1M+ in US), extremely disabling and always includes myalgia (and/or arthralgia). It's almost identical to Fibromyalgia."
4,tricky idea to grasp but cute story,"my 2 1/2 yr old daughter loves pat hutchins books. this was one of the few we hadnt read so we picked it up at the library. Reading it to her, she didnt quite grasp the whole idea of how things that someone says can be mistconstrued and hears another way then retold in error. I tried to explain it to her but she didnt seem to get it. I think this is something (similary to whisper down the lane) that would be totally enjoyed by a kindergarten level and up to probably 1st grade."
5,You will enjoy this book. I promise.,"Big Dead Place is a great combination of Antarctic history and Antarctic humor. It's fascinating to see that a place that could be described as an icy hell has somehow become a beaurocratic one as well. While the tone of the book is lighthearted, with an emphasis on humor, it's clear that Johnson cares deeply about Antarctica. This book gave me a great insight into Antarctica, one that I doubt I could have gotten elsewhere; it did so whilst being funny! If you get this book, you will be entertained and you will learn something about what is probably the strangest place on the planet. I can't recommend it highly enough."
3,UGMT,"Our years in McMurdo mostly overlapped although our jobs did not.I can verify at least 1/2 of the book's events are definitely true (saw it), 30% are very likely true (saw immediate evidence), 15% are probably true (saw evidence of evidence) and only about 5% are beyond my knowledge.A clear example proving high levels of eductation do not necessarily lead to utopian existence.Having disparaged the place, it is amazing how many people become addicted to the place including the book's author and myself."
5,One of my favorite books.,"'Big Dead Place' is one of the funniest books I've read. Nick Johnson has a fantastic eye for the absurdities of life: he's a cruder and dirtier Bill Bryson, describing the crudest and dirtiest outpost soiling a pristine continent. Imagine David Foster Wallace, had Wallace been a hard-drinking garbage man prone to accidentally setting his clothes on fire. 'Big Dead Place' reminds me of Wallace's masterpiece, 'A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again', but placed in Antarctica rather than on a Caribbean cruise ship.If you like cute stories about penguins, don't read this book. If you want to learn about tyrannical Ellsworth Station commander Finn Ronne's botched penguin executions using an ice pick and a boot, and understand why McMurdo's current Raytheon managers aren't much more enlightened than Ronne, read 'Big Dead Place'."
2,A soulless exposition on the author's mental condition,"There certainly are a lot of facts about Antarctica in this book, but you will quickly realize that you are reading about the continent through the lens of a writer with manic depression, to whom the only interesting thing in the world is the limitless ability of human beings to cause suffering for each other. The only times he uses positive language are to describe a toy as ""cute"" (and I fear this may be sarcastic) and to reminisce about sex acts performed on him. Everything else is uninteresting to him until it involves suffering or punishment. He hardly even puts in a good word for his coworkers, whom he describes as vulgar, dirty, and stupid, I was interested to learn about the crazy bureaucracy of Antarctic stations, but after a few chapters this book really becomes a grind and unpleasant to read."
1,big dumb book,"The concept of this book is intriguing: an insider's view of an Antarctic research facility. Unfortunately the author seems more interested in ridiculing his former employers than providing anything insightful on how the place actually operates. The gist of his story is that menial laborers are not well paid and accommodations are sparse. Right - were you expecting to make $250K a year hauling garbage and mopping kitchens? The blue collar workers viewed as heroes by the narrator come across as losers. The author continually boasts about getting drunk, getting laid and fighting against The Man. Their dorm room hijinks are no more wacky than your typical state university student housing. Who cares..."
1,Big Dead Place,"Somewhat interesting, and at times amusing. Although at times there is potential for depth in critically evaluating living at the bottom of the world, the author rarely goes there. He is stuck on the absolute surface of things, rattling along, I suspect, on pot or some other substance. He seems to have no perspective from which he can organize his observations into any kind of meaningful structure."
3,Lacks a lot of info,"this book seemed great when I bought it, but every item I was unsure about is not listed in the book. It is not a complete catalog and should not say ""Company Catalog Reprints"" because it is not a reprint of the catalogs at all. Very unhappy with this."
3,Too much background,"Maybe it's because I've read most of the other Sector General stories.. I felt that Final Diagnosis had way too much explanation in it. Most of the other books do explain the alien physiology classifications that White uses, which is fine, but this particular plot could have fit in a thimble after all the explanations had been cut."
3,Good work by Burns,"This has all the strengths of a Burns' special (This time Ric, not his brother Ken): a great topic, informed sometimes colorful experts and a storyline that takes you from start to finish in a cohesive manner. This documentary is especially good the way it ties in the career of writer Herman Melville. If this documentary has a fault, it relies too much on narrative and not enough on film. It is after all a movie, but you almost doubt it after a while. You could listen to this DVD in another room and not miss much.Yet, there aren't that many films out there on this subject, so it's hard to be too critical."
3,Too Many Tangents,"C.S. Lewis was an amazing man, but I didn't think this book did him justice. It was better than nothing, but considering that there are so many other Lewis biographies out there, I wouldn't recommend this one.I thought there were way too many tangents. Every chapter opened up with a description of the countryside, and the book was full of poems and quotes from various authors that were related, but not relevant. I guess it's a stylistic thing, and some people might like it, but I didn't. The writing didn't impress me either."
1,Get the real Bemis wick instead,This is not a genuine Bemis product. It does not last as long as a real Bemis wick; you will be replacing this product more often.
4,Florsheim shoes are comfortable and stylish,"I've been wearing this shoe and others in the Florsheim line for years, and they are the only shoes that are comfortable for me. Other shoes seem to rub at my ankle, or are too stiff, or otherwise don't feel good on my feet.I've been happy with this shoe."
4,A fish in the hand is worth two in the sea,"No one's going to tell me that this is not an exceptionally good idea. I enjoyed making them with half of the kids in my family, and attacking the other half with my bepuppeted hand, just like the late (and apparently huge) Rod Hull did with Emu on Parky that time. Really funny. Though the wife sent me to bed without any supper."
2,Citizen Moon Phase Watch,"The watch is nice looking, with a moon phase function, which I wanted. It does not work, however. It keeps time, but I am unable to adjust the date. The book I got with it gave the wrong instructions for the watch I purchased. I'm wondering if this was really a new watch, as advertised. I doubt I'll be buying more watches from Amazon."
5,Great watch!,"I love the watch. It's very stylish and keeps impeccable time. It's a little complicated to set initially but once you get the hang of it, that's not a problem either. It just looks great and works well. I highly recommend it. Plus I haven't experienced any issues with the watch being solar compared to other watches."
4,Very innovative.,"If you have liked other Prefuse, you will certainly like this short album. Once again, the beats are ambient, yet grounded in a solid groove. This album is worth the money. Great beats!"
4,Do judge this book by it's cover,"Five Smooth Stones is about a regular girl in the Revolutionary War period.Hope has her father is at war, her brother is away and her mother is expecting a baby. This novel revolves around the lifestyle and history of the late 1700's and gives you a great lesson about that time period and has you conncet with a girl in that world. Although this book is only 93 pages not counting photos and drawings and has a little bit large typing the book give you a lot of feelings to take in and the use of the words, shall, ye, and thou are many.I reccomend this book to girls or boys with an avid interest in history within a diary formed book."
3,Interesting but lacking.,"""Five Smooth Stones: Hope's Revolutionary War Diary"" is a decent book for younger readers learning about the lifestyle led by colonists during The Revolutionary War. For historical points, this book is lacking, until the Historical Note at the end of the story. Read ""The Winter of Red Snow: The Revolutionary War Diary of Abigail Jane Stewart, Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, 1777,"" also by Gregory, with or instead of this book, to get a bigger and better picture of The Revolutionary War. A good book for younger readers interested in history, but might be boring for older more knowledgeable history buffs. I ""kind of"" recommend."
2,Five Smooth Stones,"It is 1776 in Phildelphia,Pennsylivana Hope Potter, Mrs.Potter (Hopes mother, and Ethan Potter (Hopes brother) are tring to make a living while Mr.Potter is at war against King Georege. They have a family buesseness on Bread St., the name of the beuness is Potter Pies they make all kinds of Pastrys. It is hard to hae a family beussinesswith only 3 people to help, but Mrs. Quinn come to help after her husband dies from a war accident. One night Ethan found out his dad switched sides, to be on King Georges side. In about a week Ethan vanishes. He left a note saying,""Went to find dad."" Mrs.Potter and Hope were sad, they couldn't beleive Ethan let them. Read Five Smooth Stones to find out if Hopes brother and father comes back and what elese is going to happen."
2,Svetlanov slows down in old age!,"I bought this recording expecting first rate production values, which it has. My disappointment is with Svetlanov. I also own the earlier Svetlanov Melodia recording to compare it to.(So Lyapunov did get past the Soviet apparatchniki after all!) This new version is way too slow. The old recording takes 49:40. This one clocks in at 61:54. That's more than 12 minutes difference! Try and get the earlier version. Maybe the Svetlanov reissues we are awash in might offer it.Musically, I find this Symphony a fountain of melody, comparable to Rachmaninov's Second. The motto theme that opens is skillfully woven throughout. The allegro vivace is a gallop through the the snowy Russian countryside in a troika.In summary: great Russian Symphony, lousy performance."
2,There's better equipment out there,Another reviewer noted that the fax uses up its ink-roll quickly --- I agree. I get a couple of junk faxes per week and that makes the machine unneccessarily expensive to own. The batteries in both handsets died after 1 year and it cost me $36 to replace them. One of the handsets seems to have gone quietly insane over the past year. It arbitrarily loses contact with the base (even when sitting next to it) and it now happens so frequently that I have to replace it. Perhaps if I had been paying more attention to it I would have noticed the onset of the handset's dementia and taken it to a doctor in time. Oh well :-(
3,New Roadside America,"I thought I was buying a new book. When I received, I found a golf score card from The Woodlands At Hawks Prairie completed with the names of Dino and Brad filled out on Fathers Day '05.The book was in excellent condition even with the score card.Also, the John Dillinger Museum is no longer in Nashville, IN (hasn't been for some time). The museum is now located in Hammond, Indiana."
2,Good intentions marred by low detail and poor organization,"While the authors' hearts are definitely in the right place, their lack of thoroughness and haphazard organization severely mars this book's usefulness as an actual working travelguide.By sorting the items under topics (e.g., ""Gators"" ""Elvis"", etc.), the book turns into a good bedside reader, and a poor guide to ""what's here."" Providing a geographical index (by state, then city) in the back, means that you're constantly flipping back and forth to try and figure what's near you. And with no map to locate a city within a state's boudaries, it's difficult to tell whether you're within a hundred miles or more. The only solution is to employ a map (paper or web-based) to figure this out.Add to this a complete lack of addresses, phone numbers or hours, and you'll find yourself searching through a phonebook as well.It's a useful source of ideas, but leaves the reader to do way too much of the legwork."
2,"Factual content good, but a very unpleasant read","I bought this book to research roadside attractions for a cross-country trip. While there is a fair amount of decent information about many offbeat attractions, the tone of the book really bugged me.Instead of celebrating the uniqueness and fun of the subject matter, the authors denigrate every single attraction. You read a couple of pages of this, and you wonder why they wrote this book, since they seem to have genuine contempt for their subject matter.So, if you are just looking for facts, it may be worth a try. However, if you are a fan of such things, it will really turn you off."
3,New Roadside America: the Modern Traveler's Guide...,"The book was informative. It would have been more helpful if it had been listed by state, so you don't have to randomly flip through the book looking through places you want to see."
4,Unusual places,We are going to be using this book to plan our road trip this summer. It has all the unusual places you never know if they really exist. Its for people who are looking for some adventure and dont mind traveling
2,Sardonic putdowns ruin the content of this book.,"I bought this book thinking it would guide me to fun and funky places to visit that were off the beaten track. Instead, it seemed to be more of an excuse to mock the very places it purported to be interested in. The topper was when Roadside America described the Aviation Museum in Ohio as if it were a joke, when in fact it is a memorable and inspiring museum. Overall, I didn't enjoy the tone of the book, which to me, seemed to be one of derisive put-downs. I think many of the places described in this book would be fun to visit, but it's hard to pick out the good from the bad, with the way this book is written."
2,Not very practical,This books gives you a lot of sites to see on your Road Trip but doesn't give you very practical advice how to get to them or their exact locations. There are a lot better books out there.
2,They took a step back.,"Compared to Mvp2003 this game is struggling. The graphics are not as good as 2003. 2003 the game look almost real, 2004 looks way to cartoonish. There is no tourmament mode. If you want to play a season you have to do a 162 game schedule. You have no option for a shorter season. One good thing about 2004 is the addition of the minor league teams.I was looking forward to this game since November. I must say I'm disappointed so far. Maybe it'll grow on me. If not I can always go back to playing 2003."
3,Thought it would be better...,"+Great Minor League SystemOld Time players, Stadiums, and Uni's are great-Computer makes every and I mean just about every amazing diving or over the shoulder catch.Outfielders can flat out fly - you really have to hit the ball in the gap to get a hit.Graphics are poor on replay's images can pixalate (should not happen on the X-box)But with the depth of play and replay value this game is a must have for any baseball fan - just not as good as I was hoping for."
1,Don't waist your time or money,"The graphics are great. I'll give it that. But if you like to play a game where the opposing team gets an inside the park home run every time they hit a gapper then this game is for you. If a ball is hit into the gap the computer will score but you will most likely only get a double if you're lucky. I've been held to a single with a gapper and a really fast player.The opposing team hits almost everything you can throw at them. Even the computer's pitchers get a hit at least once a game even if you make a great pitch. It doesn't matter if it's in a hot zone or a cold zone. If you pitch it, they will hit it.Don't waist your money on this game."
4,MVP Baseball 2004,THis game is so cool. It is the best baseball game out there. It has a huge franchise mode. You can even play in the minor leagues and make your way up to the pros. It has every AA and AAA minor league team. The graphics are the best! The gameplay is what makes the game. Don't buy ESPN Major Leauge Baseball or anyother game just because it is cheaper. Go for the extra 10$ and buy MVP Baseball 2004.Graphics=AGameplay=A+Franchise mode=A+Overall Grade=A++
4,Amazing,"At least, I think it will be by reading up on the previews and everything. Obviously, it is a must buy for any hardcore baseball fan. I think it will play like the old High Heat series but with the EA Sports graphics and flair."
1,Very disappointing,This game is no different than MVP 2003 and is blown away by ESPN Major Leauge Baseball 2k4.The graphics are choppyThe crowd sucksGraphics B-Gameplay B+Sound C+Realism B-DO NOT get this game! i wasted 50 $
2,too difficult,"I just bought this game recently and there are so many things in it that it's confusing to get around. Even after reading the instructions I found that being in control of hitting and fielding were quite difficult. Many things take a long time to get used to and there's so many different options off of the main menu that I never know where to go. I suppose it is a good game if you figure everything out... but in my opinion, that would take a while! Even after that fact, it would get very boring to play inning after inning of the same things happening. I don't recommend this game unless you are a true hard-core fan of baseball, or you have played it before you buy it. Try Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004, that's an awesome game."
4,it pretty cool,the graphics are awesome the players look like the real thing i dont like that barry bonds isint in the game and arod aint on the yankees he still on the rangers and the home run derby sucks the picther showdonw is good after all the bad things it good.
5,belts with a little give,"excellent product, hard to find in stores, quick delivery...great price..today comfort...tomarrow diet!"
2,Didn't last,Love the comfort and look of this belt but I wore it just a few times before the buckle end began to come apart. Very disappointing.
5,Great quality,I bought 4 of these for my husband because he couldn't find them in stores. I crossed my fingers until they arrived (very quickly) and he said they're better than the Docker belts he had been buying.
5,Good quality for the price,"I wear belts that match my clothing style. These belts are not an everyday wear quality, but they serve a purpose when rotated. They carry a bit more length that large size I buy for my 38"" waist, but not too much more."
4,Nice belts,"These belts are fine, but do not stretch like other belts I have purchased in the past. Be sure to get ""true to size"" belts, as there is little give in them. Otherwise, they are sturdy."
2,It's falling apart after two months,"I bought this belt for my boyfriend on last July 2010. And it's already falling apart now (in not more then two months actually). And the inside of the buckle that is made by a fake leather is start to peeled out. My boyfriend was surprised when he realize the belt is start falling apart. Because he thought the belt will last atleast for couple of months. To be honest, i'm a little dissapointed."
3,Expandable Elastic Belt,"I have had this type of braided elastic belt before.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006UD6VE/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imgThe belt seems to last forever, but the leather at the tip and about the buckle does not. Hence the reason I gave the belt *** instead of more."
2,Different lengths for the same size.....?,"I bought two small and two medium sizes (four total), based on the positive reviews despite how old (2009) they were. When I received the four belts, I understood why the negative feedback was much more recent. The issue: neither set of the two (small or medium) come with exactly the same length. Sure, the two mediums were longer than the two smalls. Yet, neither the two smalls had the same length and neither of the two mediums had the same length. This signifies that either the quality has gone down or simply the merchant Belt Outlet has no quality control and simply buys out-of-spec garbage from cheap manufacturers. Now I am just waiting to see if anything falls apart like the other negative reviews."
3,Almost made it a year...,"""""""""YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR""""""""""""this one must have been put together by little children in China...the last elastic belt I bought elsewhere lasted me OVER 10 YEARS!! This one lasted 9 months. I will spend a little more and get one that lasts. Why 3 stars?? Because I only paid 15 bucks and it lasted decently."
1,Poor quality,"The price was good, but my husband is quite disappointed in the quality of this product. The ""leather"" casing over the buckle started to tear off right away. The tail end of the belt was hard to push through the belt keeper. Also it was hard to push the prong through the stretchy fabric of the belt."
3,Fabric Elastic Stretch Belt:,"The belt is great. Gain a little weight no problem it strecthes loss some weight and and no problem just tighten it a little. There are no hook holes to worry about should these problems occur. which makes it the perfect belt. Also it comes in a vartiety of colors, so black or brown is not your only choices. On the down side it started to fray some. I'm hoping that a little super glue will solve this problem. So far so good. Other than that I think it's a great belt.Thank youDonna"
5,"great belt, comfortable and useful","the fabric elastic stretch belt has been,for me, the perfect solution to the problem of jeans and other pants designed to sit below the waist. these kinds of pants have a tendency to slide down. the stretch belt keeps the pants up without giving me the constricted feeling I get from other belts. I can buckle it to conform to my figure so its very comfortable--I can forget I'm even wearing a belt. I highly reommend this product."
5,belt delivers,This elastic belt delivers with comfort & good looks. Just what one needs to adjust to any length.
5,A Great story,A great story about a spoiled rich boy changing bodies with a carnival boy and seeing himself and his family from the outside. A rare book that I could give to my 11yo son and he actually finished and loved. He seems to be in a forgotten age range for authors. Thank You Anthony Horowitz! By the way I read it and loved it too!
1,Dissapointed,"I was raised Christian, but very recently have been actively pracicing Buddhism. Although I have rejected many of the belifs from Christian church, I am still trying to reconcile my Christian upbringing with Buddhism. I read Living Buddha, Living Christ a while ago and although the message was simplistic, I enjoyed the book. I was expecting further discussion of Christianity and Buddhism in Going Home, but was dissapointed that it was a disjointed series of dharma talks with the difficult to understand, circular language that many Buddhism books contain and little real content on Christianity and Buddhism."
1,Tired teachings from a seemingly tired teacher,"I was at the retreat when Thich Nhat Hanh released this book. He admitted that ""he did not write it."" And it's true. It is a compilation of ""dharma talks"" that he gives on an almost daily basis. And its the same talks, year after year. (...)Once a prolific poet, it's a shame to see Nhat Hanh resort to rote transcriptions of his talks to sell books, almost as if to cash in on his recent popularity.Sadly, changes in editors and publishers have taken their toll; or is it just old age?"
5,Walks in Beauty,This is a beautiful book that you can open to any page and wisdom is revealed. This book gives examples of how to walk in peace and compassion and gives the why to walk this way. It also explains the differences and similarities between Christianity and Buddhism. I highly reccomend this book to anyone who is seeking answers and reasons.
5,BEAUTIFUL,"If you have any interest in comparative religion you need to read this book. Hanh is a master of poetically clarifying the parallel essence of both Christianity and BUddhism. His reverence for Jesus and his noble existence as a Vietnamese monk allow for the beauty of both belief systems to soothe you soul. It is a fluid continuation of ""Living Buddha, Living Christ"". It allows Buddhist to love Jesus and Christians to love Buddha. It is a very important book and subject for our world."
4,Affirmation of my Christian beliefs,"For searching Chistians and Buddhists,Thich Nhat Hanh validatesthe ancestoral roots and traditions that take us back to Jesus andBuddha. As a Christian, I began the book expecting a conversion toBuddhism. However the author stresses the importance of honoring your religious roots (whatever they might be) as a foundation on which to build insight into other spiritual beliefs. If the foundation for your religious beliefs is strong you won't be threatened by the comparison between Buddhism and Christianity. While reading this book I chuckled at the thought of a mainline Protestant author being bold enough to write a book comparing Jesus to other great spiritual leaders."
5,Carefree Tires,"Great Product. I would recommend these tires for anyone who is tired of having to air up the tires before they can use a hand truck, wheel barrow, etc. I purchased a garden sprayer to pull with my riding mower and before I could use it had issues with one of the tires. I knew immediately what I needed to do since I have these tires on my hand truck and my wheel barrow. These tires will outlive probably anything you install them on. I purchased a Carefree tire for my wheel barrow and have had no problems for almost 10 years."
2,Overpriced.,This sauce seems overly extract ridden. Very little flavor and a whole lot of chemical flavor. Not what I would expect from an $8 sauce.Not on par in terms of flavor for a real chili head.
4,A weighty effort,"This is a very clear set of maps, well organized and easy to read. Likely tourist destination sites are clearly marked and driveability of the roads well color-coded. This latter is important as 'A' routes vary widely in width, not necessarily indicated by the number of digits after the 'A'. Exit/entrance points of limited-access roads are also clearly indicated. The only drawback to it is the weight and size which, although not excessive, is a consideration."
3,Best Of The Originals,"The Best of the Originals series. But be warned that this is not the real Lenny: It is not live (the CD breaks off into ""bits"" which was not Lenny's style at all). It is also censored so badly you can hear the edits!Check Out the Carnegie Hall Concert. Still, this CD does have some good bits."
5,From the Back Cover:,"In the striking works of Pre-Raphaelite, Symbolist and Art Nouveau artists and in their literary parallels, Patrick Bade uncovers an extraordinary, disturbing world of sexual fantasy and a remarkably pervasive image of woman as destroyer. Enchantress, priestess, siren, sphinx and angel of death, the femme fatale became the sinister new heroine of an entire generation and one of the most powerful symbols of change in late nineteenth century society. LAVISHLY ILLUSTRATED WITH PHOTOGRAPHS!!!!!"
2,Lackluster at best,"Game board is quite small -- the dimension of the box -- should have been three times the size, really, how much can cardboard cost? Game discs are colored blanks. Stickers come with it. You have to put the stickers on yourself, one at a time. Overall feel of components is cheap. Game is quite dull and repetitive even for youngsters. This one is a real, steaming, stinker and a terrible value, or as one might say, a rip. Highly NOT recommended."
4,THE TOE,"The liquid is like Dr. Scholls --but works well in 8-12 hours. A bit costly, and came from Europe, but does the job"
3,NICE BOOT,NICE BOOT FOR MY HUSBAND-NOT THE MOST COMFORTABLE THOUGH COMPARED TO THE OTHER TIMBERLANDS .
3,An Entertaining Read,"Although I have been anxiously awaiting the next book from the author of Good Hair, I was disappointed that this new book doesnt live up to the outstanding quality of the first. Nevertheless, I found it an enjoyable story to read in one sitting. I will still look forward to Ms. Littles next book."
2,Character Development is Totally Lacking,"After I read this book, I didn't feel that I knew the characters at all. Why did any of the characters do what they did? I left the book not knowing. Nor did I get a feel for the real Buppy lifestyle that the book was to tell us about. Ms. Little should keep trying, but read the book before it goes to press!"
4,Not as great as Good Hair but really good,"I enjoyed this book. It brought up a lot of important issues that were barely uncovered. But like me, you have probably thought about them indepth on your own. I read the book in one weekend because I was so interested in the lifes of the characters. I was looking for a more hopeful ending but it was real. I'm sure my life is going in the same direction as a female investment banker."
3,"Not bad, but you may want to wait for the paperback","The Itch was better written than Good Hair, and the characters were a little more rounded (e.g. more positive male & female images). The interaction between the couples was also very interesting. Little work has improved and I will continue to support her work."
1,One of The Worst Novels I Have Ever Read,"Weak plot, weak characters, and horrible prose. Are we so hard up as a people that we would consider this kind of garbarge fiction? I urge anyone with any sense to avoid this ""novel"" at all costs. Ugh!"
1,Boring and Pointless,I could not even get through the first 2 chapters of this one. I put it down after 1 1/2 chapters. It had no point--just about the lives of these upscale black women.
2,"Good plot, very weak writing","I listened to the book in cd and even though the plot is interesting and it feels very insightful at times (specially for white people like me), the writing is very weak, and that makes it hard to get through.Also, I get the impression most black men are a disaster when it comes to marriage, I cannot believe that is true."
4,Great Book,This is the follow-up to Good Hair. Benilde is a terrific writer and keeps you wanting more. Another fast read if you are looking for a book that will keep your interest.
5,Can we get a sequel!!!!!!!,"Ms. Little has done it again. I read Good Hair a couple of years ago and just completed The Itch. I started the book on a Thursday night and unfortunately had to good to work on Friday so I couldn't read during work but after work, it was on. I couldn't get a thing done due to the fact that I was all into the book. I read all Friday night and finished Saturday. I really enjoyed the book. I kind of felt sorry for Abra but that goes to show us women that we shouldn't revolve our whole life around a man. We have to learn to make ourselves happy. There should definitely be a sequel to this book (SOON!!). I hope Ms. Little continues to keep up the good work. I can't wait for her next book to drop."
4,"I enjoyed reading, The Itch. Benilde has improved.","The Itch was better written than Good Hair which shows that Benilde is improving as a writer. The book briefly touched upon interracial relations (i.e. Abra's and Griffin's brief relationship)and gives a glimpse into upper African-American society. Abra's character could have been developed more as well as Cullen. I think Benilde focused too much on Natasha and Miles. However, I did respect Cynthia and Miles for being honest enough to see that they wanted out of their relationships. Cullen got exactly what he deserved ""DUMPED"". The reader could easily see where the climax was heading."
1,"A really silly, trifling, badly written, empty book",Benilde Little can write. Not very well. Just enough to be considered literate. Brand names alone do not a character make. And the plot of a novel should be more complex than that of a sitcom on the WB Network. This is the worst book that I've read in quite a while. I only finished it because I found myself admiring Ms. Little for her bravery. It must have taken a lot of guts to publish this novel under her own name.
2,Boring! Skipped around too much!,"Natasha was totally boring! Abra was more intersting, but she got boring also! The book should have left out Natasha! You saw where the book was going! You could read to the middle, and skip to the end! And not miss anything really!"
3,Okay.,"This book wasn't the best, but it wasn't bad either. I found it to be a slow read at the beginning but, it picked up toward the middle of the book. Apparently, Little's books always seem to move that way, as it also did in Good Hair. Overall, it was a good book."
3,The Itch. I'm still scratching&#65533;..,"A great story with a bad ending. This is the first book that I've read by Ms. Little and I truly enjoyed her writing, I just didn't like the ending. After that really good story and building of characters the ending left a big blank. A good read but a little disappointing."
1,"A silly, trifling glance at silly, trifling characters","There is no depth here. None at all. I gave Little a try with Good Hair, which was a decent debut. After all novels are hard to write. I don't know what happened with The Itch, but clearly Little has lost the modicum of talent that she had. If there was the chance to give this novel zero stars I would have."
4,"a new take on african american life,entertaining and witty","Little's second offering is an entertaining look at upscale African American life in the 90's. Told from a ""sista's"" perspective while wholly embraceable by any one who has loved and lost, or fantasized about the glamorous world of entertainment... It is an easy summer read..perfect for the busy person who just wants to relax without the banality of network TV..Bravo Benilde, keep 'em coming!"
4,Just call them the Talented Tenth,"Benilde Little revisits the African American upper-crust with her sophomore effort.Little is such a refreshing author because she forsakes all the pathology in which media has blacks dwell. No crack addicts or unemployment lines here, this is a touch of reality.Our heroine Abra has perfect life, she is a succesful TV producer, shared 5 years of marital bliss, she and her hubby are trying to have a baby, are the envy of their friends and Cullen is going to make partner any day now. But she discovers that this is not enough.The cool thing about this novel is that it is a veiled sequel to 'Good Hair.' I think readers will have to pick up the first novel to really appreciate 'The Itch'We find out what happens to Sherry Steptoe and Miles Browning. It will take a few rounds of Negro Geography to place some characters, but if you've read Good Hair, you're memory will eventually jog.As engaging and funny as 'Good Hair,' this novel is about searching."
2,Too depressing,"It was some parts in this book that I can relate on but the book is too depressing. It didn't have a happy ending and was so heart-broken. Instead there should of been a better ending and also had the characters really expecting more out of life than just money and a man. The name of the book should of been ""Heart-Break"". Not a single person in the book ever stayed happy or even ended happy. A lot of black authors write books about ""blacks"" being rich or high class. But some really don't face reality. We need more books relating to today's society more of reality instead of our hopes,dreams,and wishes. This book showed nothing but shabbiness, something I care less of. I just hope the next one I read from this authors be something that surprises me."
1,Hmmm...,"While I usually enjoy Little's writing, I was somewhat dissapointed with this novel. It was very, very depressing. I also did not care for any of the characters except for the dog-with-a-heart-of-silver (not quite gold), Miles. I hated Abra's husband, he is exactly what makes me fear marriage. A gutless, spineless, poor excuse for a human being, period. Abra seems dreary and dull, I don't see how anyone could have envied her. Natasha is awfully flashy, loud and ""ghetto"" acting to be from her educational background. All she needs is four inch fingernails and some fake Gucci bags and she'd be a poster girl for bama's everywhere. This book pale grossly next to ""Good Hair"". I would not recommend this book to anyone."
4,A good insight to how the talent 10% lives!,"This book reads easily and I read it in one day.Benidle Little provides good insight to the lives of BAP. In comparison to her first novel, Good Hair, did a better job in developing the characters and providing the readers with more insight to the differnt lives of the characters. I was glad to read some of the same characters from Good Hair in this novel. I enjoyed being part of the lives of Miles, Abra, Cullen, and Natasha. My favorite character is Natasha--she is confident, independent, strong, and down-to-earth. She reminds me of the strong 90's woman. I wish Abra and Cullen would have gotten back together. I hope she has the baby in the next novel. I was disappointed with the ending--It is time for Miles to grow up! I would love to see the sequel and see if he and Cynthia paths cross again.Keep the good work up Mrs. Little."
4,Thinking about getting married - read this book first.,"Delightfully unpredictable. It's a love story where the journeys are profoundly more enlightening than the destinations. Benilde Little draws you in with this tittilating ""yarn"" about people seeking love. This book is about the choices people make and the magnitude of the ensuing consequences of those choices on one's self and those around you. I think this should be given to any couple thinking about getting married. It reaffirms my belief that people shouldn't even consider marriage until they've reached their thirties but moreover, until they've reached their ""me""."
4,A great way to pass a snowy weekend!,"I spent the weekend reading this book and I liked it a lot. I am glad that Cullen got what he deserved - we all know what they say about the grass being greener . . . The story about Natasha and Miles was heartbreaking, but she handled the situation with class - I don't know if I personally could have risen to the occasion. I read Good Hair a few years ago and that was excellent also - I may have to read it again to figure out how the characters are similar to those in The Itch.I look forward to Benilda's next book."
4,Good look at Relationships in the 90's,The friendship that Abra and NaTarsha shared was a blessing. NaTarsha was my favorite character. She handled her breakup from Miles with class. I was happy that Abra went on with her life after her marriage to Cullen ended. Very impressive Benilde. Be Blessed.
4,Very good read!,"It was very enlightening and realistic. I read the book in one day! I've read both of her novels and have found both of them to provide insight into the ""Black Upper Middle Class"". The characters were well developed and very entertaining. I would love to read more from this Ms. Little."
4,Paianfully realistic.,"'The Itch', was a a candid look at relationships in the 90's. The main female characters again show how important it is to have a shoulder to lean on. Little, paints a sad, but realistic picture of life and the pursuit of that seemingly unreachable love. What was a little odd was the break up of the Abra's marriage, had no warning signs, and I couldn't quite figure her relationship with her producer. Natasha handled the break up with Miles in a grande fashion, I was glad she let go with style and class. Would like to have known where Miles' head was as he was leaving. I would recommend reading this."
3,GOOD JOB,"I thought this book was better than Good Hair because the characters were more developed. I enjoyed the friendship between the two women though they were very different in their thinking as it related to relationships. The message I received was, make your own way and do not make any one person the center of your life. Stop living in la-la land."
2,Too clumsy for a touch-typist,"I tried this keyboard with my Treo 650. It was very difficult to get it to work. I used the web download to automatically download the most current drivers (or so I thought) to my Treo. That driver didn't work. I then used the driver that came on the CD. Finally worked, but only if I unchecked ""reconnect,"" which is the opposite of what the instructions said to do.Once I finally got it working, I was very disappointed with the accuracy of the keyboard. I could barely type anything without some kind of typo caused by the keyboard. The space bar in particular repeatedly failed to register, and I very frequently had to go back and insert a space.Overall, I found it not much faster (and tons more frustrating) than just using the tiny thumb keyboard on the Treo itself.For the $$$, I would expect a lot more.I do not recommend this for people used to touch typing."
3,Instructions Severely Lacking,"The product itself is great once you can figure out how to install it. The instructions are missing a critical piece that caused me to drill unnecessary holes in my truck. When I called customer service, they faxed me the missing instructions and a new template for my truck. The template was not the right size. I needed to make manual adjustments to avoid drilling additional unnecessary holes."
2,Incomplete rebuild kit,"Sure the price is inviting, but don't waste your money/time on this incomplete kit like I did. The OEM Mariner kit 21-30430A14 is what you need. It includes the two check valves needed to get the pump to work the way it did years ago. Amazon offers it for only $21 and yes, I ended up getting that kit and taking the pump back apart to fix it right."
3,Not for senisitive skin,"I used this gel for about 3 weeks. I think my scars faded a bit but before I could see real results my skin got an allergic reaction against it. Now I have to say, that I really have sensitive skin and I should have known that before but my skin kept reacting to this product even after I took a shower. I had to use a peeling to at least get everything off so that my skin can calm down.I think it works well (if you have patience) with people who are not very sensitive when it comes to putting something like that on their skin every day but it is definitely not for someone like me:(("
3,Eh..,"I got this from a seller, not Amazon. I received it rather quickly although when I opened it, nearly half was gone and the green DNA design was all messed up. I notified the seller and provided some pictures and they responded quickly. I ended up getting a refund since I didn't want a jar and a half of this stuff since the amount should last a long time.A little goes a long way since I put thin layers. I've been using this for several weeks, usually in the nighttime after I washed my face. Sadly, I haven't seen any improvements to my hyper pigmentation from acne. I was really hoping this would be the answer but for me, it isn't.It didn't have any negative effects on me. It's just like I've never tried it. I'll continue using it to see if there's any improvement over a greater length of time, but for the time being, I'm leaving this as 3 stars. If I see any signs of change, I'll update my review.."
1,very disappointed,i got this and i was excited to get this and try it out. i applied it and the next morning i had red spots where i applied it. my skin was an uneven red and it was horrible. it made my face worse. i cant even use it. waste of money. this product is horrible! it ruined my face
4,great!,It does exactly what it says it does. I have very sensitive skin and it didn't break me out at all. It's worth the money.
2,CAUTION: This product is MAXIMUM STRENGTH!!,"I just wanted to be sure to caution buyers that this product is maximum strength. I purchased it thinking that it was regular strength, and it caused me major skin irritation and some damage. Understandably, the seller will not refund if it has been opened, but I do hope they will change the listing to note this. Just please be sure that you can handle a maximum strength product and are aware that you will not be able to receive a refund if you use it. Just a caution for buyers."
3,Nice Read,"I thought this book was a nice finish, yet it needed more work into it since it's the final sequel to the Sons & Daughters Series.Atlas'labor was to escort Widow Charlotte Clairmore to 5 events, yet Charlotte is skittish when it comes to social events. Charlotte tries to put space between herself and others due to her daughter's uncle who is trying to get custody of Opal. Regardless of how much space she puts between herself and Atlas, it doesn't work because she already develop a love for Atlas. Atlas tells her about the labor he has to do, and she goes to the functions so that she can get a 2 horse team from him. Opal likes Atlas a lot and convinces her mom to marry Atlas.The ending ended short. There was no mention of what his gift was in the end. Nor did Atlas tell his grandma that he told Charlotte about the labor even though it's a family secret."
4,Peter Morrison,This is a great resource for people that want to learn about the ecology and behaviour of salmon.I wish it went a little more into the effects of dams and hatcheries on salmon ecology and behavior.
5,Outstanding Devotional,"This is the 4th copy of Wisdom from the Proverbs that I have purchased. I have given away three copies and have one of my own on the nightstand beside my bed. This devotional is concise, practical, and biblically sound. I highly recommend this book."
2,Lyrica,"This was listed with clitoral stimulant, sexual enhancement preparations. As such, it doesn't do much."
1,A.W.F.U.L.,"I eagerly awaited the arrival of this product. But was disgusted by the ingredients. I tried it anyway....just to see. First, it smells like nasty cheap drugstore perfume. Secondly, it burns in an irritating way. Not pleasant at all!! Third, when Hubby and I engaged in relations and he got a taste of it...he nearly threw up. So I tasted it myself....G.R.O.S.S. IT is like you just put a perfume cap in your mouth. Try that before you buy this if you enjoy anything orally related. Just disgusting."
5,Changing Pace:Outdoor games for Experential Learning,"This is an excellent book for trainers who wish to break the monotony of training indoors and whose only knowledge of outdoor games are those related to ice-breakers and normal telematches types. I have used (perhaps overused wh=ould be more appropriate) the activities in the book with great degree of success with groups of varying age ranges. However, if you own a copy of Outdoorgames for Trainers, be warned, it is the one and same book, albeit with a different title. The fact that the games are now paginated is not a good enough reason to purchase it again!Could Amazon.com ensure that authors who re-title their books declare this fact if not many customers will end up pruchasing the same book and demand refunds for this fact alone."
