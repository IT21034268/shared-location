1,did anyone like this book? there is a good reason if not!!!,"...I love historical fiction and all the better that it was over 1000 pages. But after struggling through 250 pages of descriptions of a what people were wearing, of a woman flipping her hair every 10 pages and descriptions of 3 different sorts of rain where no one seems to get wet I decide that this is some sort of woman's book about the hinting scents of love and has a storyline with as much action as watching a puddle dry up..."
5,The Fiery Cross,Love this series of books. AM reading it for about the third time. I would thoroughly recommend. When is Diana going to bublish the next in the series as I have read all the curent ones
2,Finished it only because I like the series,"If The Fiery Cross hadn't been in the middle of a series that I really like, with characters that I love, I would have quit reading it. This book was clearly well researched down to the minutest detail, and unfortunately, every bit of that detail is in the book. Much of the book isn't germane to the storyline or the plot, and I am sad to say that I was bored. I skimmed a good bit to keep awake. If the next one is this dull, I'll wait for the movies to find out what happens in the remainder of the series. Sorry, Diana Galbadon. I wanted to like it more."
2,The worst one of the series,"I am an avid DG fan, and have read all of the books to this series. This one is the only review I will post, reason being because I waited SOOOO long for it's release after the Drum's book. The writer is a classic for ""leaving you hanging"" until the next book. I have to honestly say, that I was really disappointed with this one. It took me forever to get thru it because of all the historical jargon and the story just lagged and lagged. If you are a first time reader of the series, I would go for the abridged version on CD (if available), and move on from there. You will not miss much and the later books are all worth the read!"
4,Not as bad as I expected.,"After reading some of the truly upsetting reviews found here, I wasn't at all looking forward to reading this book. I came close to buying the abridged audio version instead, so I could quickly get to A Breath of Snow and Ashes.However, I'm glad that I decided to stick with it. It was like the opposite of going to see a movie you've heard incredible things about and then being disappointed; I'd heard such bad things about this book that I ended up being pleasantly surprised.No, it isn't constant action and peril like the others, which I found refreshing - it was nice to see Jamie and Claire get a little bit of a ""normal life"" going. There was a nice amount of time spent on their relationship, and I found my relationship with the characters much improved.So don't be discouraged...this book might not be what you expect, but it might not be as bad as you expect, either."
2,Where was the Editor?,"I picked this up the first day out, read the first 200 or so pages, but just can't find the motivation to finish. Where was the editor?I've found that if a book doesn't grab me from the beginning, it lingers beside the bed for a few months, until it eventually finds it's way back to my book shelf (where this one will go), or to the used book store. I'll keep this one because I'd like to have a complete set. Well, also complete. I didn't purchase the Companion. When I'd read that there was a star chart or some such nonsense included for Jamie & Claire, well, come on.Maybe I'll have finished Cross by the time the last book is published or at the least, I'll have skimmed through."
2,An effort to get through it,"I fell in love with the Outlander series and wouldn't miss one of them. That being said, I almost struggled through ""The Fiery Cross"". Way too much description, large sections had nothing to do with anything and weren't even interesting from a reader's standpoint. There were some action sequences in this book, but the book should have been at least half as many pages. The story line would have moved much faster and readers would have been satisfied just as well...even more so. I found myself wondering many times when something would happen.I'm looking forward to reading Book 6 simply because of the more positive reviews."
3,Very Good,"The Fiery Cross is a good book. Continues the stortyline of Jamie & Claire Fraser well. I think that this book has slowed down, some as in the events happening. Not as sit on the edge of your seat type drama that was in the other books. But by the time you come to this book you are willing to keep reading, even though it's kind of slow. I will read it again,and again."
3,Not the Best,"Have to agree with earlier postings that this was not the best of the 5 Outlander books. There were glimmers of adventure here and there and one certainly comes to appreciate the drudgery and boredom which was part of everyday life in the wilderness--not to mention the misery of living thru a damp, cold, cheerless winter--something which most of us have never experienced in our modern world. I missed the time travel element in this book since all of the main characters are now living in the 1700's. Hope Diana will take a bit longer to do the Revolutionary War chapter of this story which should present all kinds of plot twists."
5,Great Book!,Anyone would read the first Outlander book fell in love with Claire and Jamie. This book has an awesome mix of their continuing love story as well as historical facts about early US history. A must read!
2,Stop writing about Frank!!,I just started the book. I just want to say something right away: STOP WRITING ABOUT FRANK! STOP TALKING ABOUT FRANK! I DON'T CARE ABOUT FRANK! I'm sooooo irrited by Claire and Bree because of Frank!! PLEASE!! Stop getting me upset!! He's in the past now! I don't feel sorry for him at all!! I don't care about him at all!! So please!! The book would be soooo much better if Frank would just remain DEAD and not mentioned again!!Will continue my other opinion later when I'm done with the book.
1,The Fiery Cross,"As terrible as the 1st 3 were great. I greatly respect DG as a writer, but this is abuse of her talent, akin to a singer repeating only one line of a song. After the 4th installment I had my doubts, so I read the reviews prior to purchase; I wish the reviewers had been more honest!There is no plot, even though a constant wave of characters and situations are introduced to peak your interest-they do not bear fruit. So sad that such an amazing trilogy was allowed to build to such an anti climatic purgurtory for the fans. One can only hope that there was either a ghost writer hired or DG was paid A LOT to abandon a good story for this meandering purposeless prose.All that being said, I am skipping the last 50 % of the book and going to the next one, if I missed somethimg important, let me know, but Ill take my chances to save myself from this slog!"
2,Not what I had hoped,"My husband and I met over this series of books, and were looking very forward to the next installment......and then it came out and I finished it first. UG! I love Diana Gabaldon, but PULEEZE!!! Brianna needs Midol and some psychosis therapy and needs to MOVE ON past playing Whose Baby Is It Anyways. I will always love Jamie and Claire, but I think Claire is getting a little risque, even for her own character. It dragged, and really, how much hell can we put Roger through and have him (realistically) live? We may have modern times characters, but they aren't superhuman. Let's keep it real, people. I put it down and had to fight to get through it....just to say I'd finished it. I'm sorry, it just wasn't what was promised or anticipated. It struggled to find it's own way, and LOTS could have been cut out.....who edited this thing?"
2,"Diana, Where was your Editor?","What a disappointment! I loved the first 4 books in this series, and eagerly awaited this one. Too bad! She rambled on and on for over 1000 pages. The plot was almost impossible to find, and the descriptive passages would have been good, had a decent editor gone at them with a red pencil. I know there is another book in the works. I recommend the author focus on plot, character development, and conciseness. She has done better before, and conceivably could do so again."
2,BURN THIS ONE!!!,"Ugh, it took me 3 weeks to finish this book. (Travel a lot).I had too many other good ones to get to first. I adored OUTLANDER, even Drums of Autumn; Voyager - so, so. but I was so enthralled with Jamie and Claire it didnt matter. I was with them once again.But that brat Brianna was not worth all the trouble Jaime and Claire went thru to have her! Then we have to put up with her smart mouth, lactation, and and her poor, unhappy, snotty baby. What little there was of Jaime and Claire was pretty good. Hated seeing them get so old so fast, altho a child like Brianna would be the excuse she was an only child.The book was much too long to endure and was anyone watching the editing? I think I will re-read Outlander in preparation for Ms Gabaldon's next. Hopefully, it will be shorter and get to a point. I, too, would like to see them back in Scotland, but alas, it is not to be."
2,Series wears out!,"I could not put down Outlander and found Ms Galbaldon's story line very unique and entertaining. Colorful and exciting as she held my interest in Highland Scotland before the Battle of Culloden, defining historical facts with great characters. I followed through with the next 3 books in the series wondering why I was not as warm to each successive book, but oh my, what has happened to her story in Fiery Cross? It's like she has fizzled in fatigue all that she could say - even about Claire and Jamie. The strength of Jamie's personality is gone. I find the book tedious and lacking suspense, a captivating plot, shallow character and poor development of Brianna and Roger. IF I finish it, I doubt I will go on in to her further books in this series. Even the author appears tired of it all! This seems to happen to many a series when the first book is wonderful and captures a readership, and following books just have little left to add to the personalities."
2,Disappointed,"My first inclinations on reading this book were wonderful. It takes a skilled storyteller to walk a reader through a protagonist's day, moment by moment, and maintain interest. The minutae in the first chapters were great. But where was the plot?I stopped midway through the book and set it aside.A month later I tried again from the beginning, thinking perhaps I'd lost some thread that would impel the story forward. Again I stopped as the story lagged. The interminable letters wore down my patience to translate the formal language of letters into something that mattered to me. There was no cohesion to the events, no central reason for moving on.It is a real pity. The author has proved over and over that her storytelling skills are topnotch. This book has become a chore, though, and I have enough chores in my life already. I will not buy the next. If it reviews better I will borrow it to read."
3,Disappointing....,"As much as I hate to give any book by Diana Gabaldon only three stars, I really have to for ""The Fiery Cross."" I waited so long to read this book and when I finally did, it was a huge letdown. Of course, there were parts of it that were good. I loved the parts written from Jamie's point of view especially. But there was too much detail in many parts and the whole thing that happened to Roger was really hard to believe (in fact the whole time-travel thing I found more believable than what happened to him). So, if you loved the previous books, definitely read this one if only to keep up with the story, but be prepared to be disappointed."
4,Once more with feeling,"I waited forever for this book to be published and when I received it I just looked at it for a week before picking it up to start reading it. It was not an all nighter, yes I could have done it like I've done Clancey's books but I didn't. I took it one bite at a time and savored it like a vintage wine. It was good to see Bonnet get it where it hurts and I have wondered about Ian for four years, at least one question is answered. It is good to see the mature love between Clare & Jamie the feelings for each other seem to get stronger with each book. I hope she ties them all up in the next one, which I hope does not take another 4 years to write.My favorite was Outlander followed by Voyger, I personally did not like Drums of Autumn but I ploughed through it, for those of you who would give up due to the length of this book my advice is to keep on reading."
1,Worst Outlander book,"I read all the others and loved them, including the Outlandish Companion. This book was so boring I gave up and still haven't finished it."
2,Not what I was hoping for.....,"After avidly reading the rest of the Outlander series, I have fallen in love with the characters, the incredible story Gabaldon gives us, and the excellent flow of words. The Fiery Cross stopped me short. After finishing Outlander in 2 days, I barely made The Fiery Cross in a month. I found myself constantly re-reading pages, trying to figure out just what had happened, and reminding myself that I love these books.Please, read Outlander, Dragonfly in Amber, and Voyager first, so that you have the stomach to attempt this book. This series is incredible and includes my now favorite books, I just have to remember that everyone has hits and misses. I am finishing A Breath of Snow and Ashes as we speak, and it has picked up the old flavor, making me oh so happy!"
2,disappointed,I was very disappointed with this book. It just did not feel like Diana Gabaldon's usual work. The story did not go any where until the last 300 pages and then I kind of felt like I was left hanging. I really thought we would know something about why Ian returned and where his wife and child were. I guess I really wanted to feel like there was something complete in the book.On the brighter side the next book I picked up was called Exit Unicorns by Cindy Brandner and it was so good. It really reminded me of Diana Gabaldon's earlier books in that I could not put it down.
1,Borrow it from the library,This book is not worth the money. I was hopefull this book would be written more in the style of the 1st three and was very disappointed when it was more like the Drums of Autumn. I also don't understand why at least once a chapter Brianna's engorged breasts had to be mentioned. I think the author is trying to push Brianna & Roger and I never really cared for these two characters.
2,No magic,"There is no magic in this book. I don't mean travelling through stones type magic. I mean the magic that hooks you and makes you read the book over and over. I'm half way through, and if I didn't have so much emotion invested in these characters from the previous books, I'd stop reading it right now. I certainly won't be re-reading it.The book is historically accurate. Overall it's well written. The details of life at that time are well explained. Perhaps the small details of life in pre-revolutionary America need to be told. But not in this book. Not in this series."
2,Bree's Book of Breastfeeding,"Being an original Gabaldon cultist, it pains me to say this book was a great disappointment. Gabaldon has dipped more into the romance genre and away from historical fiction with this ode to Brianna's Big Breastfeeding Boobies. Geez! After reading about Bree's breasts and Claire and Jamie's stolen intimate moments over and over again I was bored to tears. The Fiery Cross did not advance the storyline, nor create any more of the famous Galbadon clues I so enjoyed discovering in her previous books of THE OUTLANDER series. Let's hope the next and final book of the series lets the characters go out with a bang, not a whimper!"
5,Fiery Cross,"Diana has done it again! How she manages to hold the reader's attention throughtout nearly 1,000 pages is impressive. Jamie and Claire are still captivating lovers and I have a sneaking admiration for Roger, their son-in-law. Funnily enough, I'm not that fond of Brianna...impressive research on the North Carolina region in the 1700's- were buffalo really that far east? Claire manages to teach the reader about the medicine and herbal remedies of the time in addition to the difficulties of frontier life. I hope we won't have to wait four years for the next volume...many mysteries still remain unsolved. The only drawback- the size of the book. I found it difficult to hold..."
4,A Not To be Missed Lead-in For the Next Book,"This installment of the series was not quite as good as the other three books but it was still a page-turner. The adventures encountered in Jamie, Claire, Roger and Breannia's day-to-day lives in Colonial America are told in great detail along with the more mundane chores. Still, Diana's writing style keeps you interested. The book, while lengthy, doesn't cover a large span of time. It seems to be more of a lead-in to the conslusion of the series than a novel in it's own right. Adventure fans and die-hard Gabaldon fans won't be disappointed though. If you have the other books, you have to have this one, too."
5,The Fiery Cross,"Having read and thoroughly enjoyed the previous Diana Gabaldon books about the tales of Jamie Fraser and Claire Randall this was simply a book I had to read. Up until around page 300 I kept wanting to put it down, hoping to come back and find it as enthralling as I found the previous books. And I did, I found myself smiling at the dry sense of humour Jamie possess. I found tears rolling down my cheeks and at other times found I was holding my breath. The attention to detail and Diana's ability to draw you into the story was wonderful. It is a long read at 976 pages and even though I kept waiting for something to happen ( as per previous books ) I wouldn't have missed reading it."
3,Where's the sex??? :),"I'm about 3/4 of the way through The Fiery Cross and I must confess that I'm a bit disappointed. Unlike other readers, I enjoyed the sexual encounters between Jamie and Claire, it underscored the relationship for me. The characters attack everything with passion, why not each other? And I'm really tired of Brianna, she's turned out to be SUCH an annoying character, I think she's really unlikable. The story is a bit bogged down with details of the mundane but there's enough of the Jamie and Claire story there to make me want to finish it."
1,Fiery Cross / A Miss,"I was disappointed in how much substance this book had in relations to her previous books in the series. I felt that there were about 120 pages of worthy reading. The other pages were redundencies. I felt that the Briana character could have been developed more. The author did point out that she was a good shooter and therefore a good hunter. It was interesting when she was trying to teach Roger how to shoot. I also liked the fact that she did not hesitate when it came to shooting Bonnet. I tired of Briana breast feeding. Come on Diana, give Roger and Briana so common excitement and let Jamie and Claire spend a little time baby-sitting the grandkid. It's also about time for someone to go through the stones and check on what history they are changing or Claire should take Jamie to the future.I don't want to know that someone else has come through the stones unless it is a colony of people that Claire, Roger and/or Brianna know! THIS BOOK IS NOT A PAGE TURNER."
3,not like the others,"I agree with some of the other reviews that this was much slower than the rest of the series. I actually enjoyed some of the descriptions of daily life, since the characters generally travel from one travail to the next in the rest of the series. It was simply too much, though. I also thought this was sure to be the end of the series, and given the amount of detail recounted, the loose ends left in the storyline were unsatisfying.As Gabaldon has gone on to write about Lord John Grey in her next book, I suppose we'll just have to live with an unfinished story..."
2,"I'll re-read Outlander, thanks","I gave up many precious hours of sleep reading Outlander, DIA, Voyager and Drums. I cried. I laughed. I named my rabbits Claire, Jamie, Roger and Bree. Unfortunately, so far the Fiery Cross is failing to keep me awake - in fact, the first 150 pages or so have put me to sleep like nothing since my Accounting textbooks. I've put it away and decided to read Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets first - more exciting and no poopie diapers."
2,SOOOOOOOOO boring.,"I've been trying so hard to finish this book. The other Outlander books have been fantastic. I couldn't get enough of them, and I hear that the next one is better, but this one makes me not want to make it to the next one. Its drawn out and boring."
2,The Fiery Cross,"Unfortunately, I have to agree with many of the disappointed Diana Galbaldon fans about this one. I spent 2 months breezing through the first three volumes of the Outlander series, finding it impossible to get anything done but read. But I really had a difficult time getting through #4 & #5, in particular. Hang in there though, while this one was not her best effort, it is still worth reading and #6 is great. I can barely wait until the next volume comes out, promised sometime in December of 2008."
5,I don't get a lot of the other reviews!,"Sure, the book is long. It's probably the longest book I've ever read and I've read some long books! But it good! Actually, it was great. I ate it up. It was a great Outlander book! Maybe not as good as The Drums of Autumn (my favorite so far - I know, sacrilegious to some Outlandish fans) but it was still very good. I love Diana's writing. Even when she's writing about soiled nappies and breastfeeding, I find it still riveting. And I'm a guy! The book was great, filled with intrigue, excitement, and amazing characterization! This was a book about Roger and Jamie. Claire and Bree take a backseat in this book and let Roger and Jamie really shine. Roger really comes into his own as a character in this book!I'm sorry if my review disappoints other fans (who trashed this book) but I really liked this book and I can't wait to leap into A Breath of Snow and Ashes."
2,I hate to be writing this......................,"I love the Outlander series and I'm in love with the characters, but this book is so boring. I am having the hardest time getting through this. The first 4 were great. I couldn't get enough, until I started this one. I haven't even finished it yet. I've gotten to page 647 and still Jamie's aunt is not married yet! The reviews for A Breath of Snow and Ashes are much better, so I've got my fingers crossed."
5,Diana is a great story-teller.,"I have read all of the books in this series, plus one about Lord John Grey. They are all spell-binding."
2,I was so disappointed I cried.,"I was caught up in the magic of Jaime and Clair. The first 4 novels moved me through all the ranges of human emotion. I couln't sleep for days because I could not put them down. I waited impatiently for this 5th novel which I find flat, long winded and quite boring. What happen to the passion and fast paced excitement? The only events covered in detail are the battles and they are colorless as well. I miss the passion."
3,"Good Love Story, Needs More action","Enthralled with the first 4 books, I read this book voraciously over the weekend. As the contining story of Jamie and Claire's love and life together, this is book is satisfying. If nothing else, the last line of the book is a keeper. If you liked the first books, definitely read this one. However, I've come away from it thinking that this storyline could have been done in about 200 pages. I wish there had been more action, less angst on the Brianna/Roger issues. This book lacked the one or two turning point moments that were in the first books (e.g, in Voyager, Claire showing up in the print shop). I still liked it, I'll definitely pick up the 6th book, but I don't think this was the best one."
1,Just read the last 100 pages-while standing in a bookstore!,"Like everyone else I loved the first 3 books, but this was worthless. Readers can easily stay on top of the main plotline by taking my advise in the title - just skip to the last 100 pages and save yourself 800+ pages of the detailed descriptions of Jemmy's soggy diapers. With all her attention to historical detail and accuracy I was longing for one more detail of 18th century life - High infant mortality rates! Can't this kid fall into a well? I hope Gabaldon's publisher will take note of the criticisms in ... and edit future books more strictly."
5,Heart Warming and Gut Wrenching,"This is a fantastic read!! Adventure, brutality, history, love...the greatest of these is love. Diana makes you feel as though you know the characters personally. Very real and all consuming. Best if you started in the beginning with Outlander. These people have history!"
2,Snoozer- Anyone want to e-mail a summary to me?,"I, like many others, very much enjoyed the previous 4 books. This one is killing me to get through. I have picked it up a few times over the last 8 months and just can't get through it.I have read past the part where the militia returns home.Anyone out there want to volunteer to summarize what happens in the last part of the book via e-mail so that I can get on with the next one?Thanks!"
3,Slower and more mundane than the rest of the Outlander series.,It just didn't have the same pick up and can't put down effect on me as all the previous books.
5,The Fiery Cross and the Outlander Series,"I like the author and the way she creates her characters. I have always been a Sci-Fi fan of time travel and, coupling that with my enjoyment of history, this series fits my liking to a tee."
4,Yet another wonderful book in the Outlander series,"Terrific story line, it had me on the edge of my seat wondering yet again how Claire and Jaime would get out of their latest difficulty. The only things I don't love about the series are Brianna, Roger, and Jemmy. I wish the story remained solely focused on Claire and Jaime. However, it's wonderfully entertaining."
3,The Fiery Cross,"3.5 starsThe book starts where the last book ends. Jamie, Claire, Brianna, Roger and Jemmy are living in America and its few years before The American Revolutionary War. There is already unrest seen by people called the Regulators which leads to fighting, and Fraser's are caught up in it.While I liked this book it wasn't as good as the previous ones. There wasn't anything big happening, we just see them living their lives. There were parts that dragged on and for the first time I really felt that the book could have been lot shorter.I loved seeing the relationship growing between Jamie and Roger. Jamie didn't seem to have too high opinion of Roger in the last book and I'm happy to see that changing.I still wish that we could have Fergus's POV instead of Roger's but I wouldn't want to lose him though.I loved the last surprise at the end but I really want to know what happened that lead to it!"
3,Not one of my favorites.,"I was a bit disappointed in this book as I was in Voyager. Too much in to the political stuff. I actually started hating Roger in this book. In all the others I could never put them down, but in this one and Voyager, I found myself avoiding reading it. I have reread the series about 9 times and now just skip over Voyager and Fiery Cross."
2,Fiery Cross Needs a Good Editor,"After patiently awaiting Diana Gabaldon's newest book I was incredibly disappointed by this large, plotless monster. The writing remains good and the characters true but it doesn't take 1000 pages to tell this particular tale. I kept hoping that something was going to happen but by page 800 I had that sinking feeling that we being led around the countryside with nothing to feel satisfied by, not even the death of a certain evil sailor. I can't believe that a loved one or even a trusted editor couldn't have persuaded Diana that there were too many details and not enough plot to pull this off. I guess she thought that 1000 pages would cover up the fact that there really wasn't a story. I won't be buying the next installment."
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"I am so disappointed! I pre-ordered this book and anxiously awaited its arrival on my doorstep. I even carried it around with me for a few days before I started reading it because I wanted it to last as long as possible. Then I listened to ""Drums of Autumn"" on tape, to refresh my memory, since it had been so long since I had read about Jamie and Claire. However, I absolutely could not finish this book. I tried to read this book on several occassions. I'd put it down and pick it up a week later. Finally, I just gave my beloved copy of Outlander to a friend to read and I was really psyched to get going on Fiery Cross. I read a few more chapters last night and I now know that I will not be able to finish this book. There are sooooo many books out there that I want to read and sooooo little time. I can't waste my time on this book and I'm feeling less guilty by the minute! If a 6th book comes out, then I'll read it, but until then...no way."
5,"Hated the book to end,","when I came to the end of this book I was sad because it was like my best friend had just left on a long vacation. People saying this wasn't as good as ""Outlander"" are crazy it is just differnt and about the mature relationship Clair and Jamie share now. I can not wait until the next book,"
3,Ready for the next one,"I love this series and read through the first 4 books in under a week. A month later I am still only on page 368 in this book. I have heard from others that they love the series and many of them stopped reading at this point and this is why. I will get through it, but wish it was different."
2,And I thought it was just me!!!,"I purchased ""The Fiery Cross"" in November and it's almost January and I haven't gotten to page 150. Oh, I will finish this novel one day but that day is far into the future. I agree totally with the reviewers who described this novel as ""boring/too slow"", I just can't get into it.I was one of the many who became hooked on the Outlander series (Claire and Jamie's story was a phenomenal -- one the great love stories of my time) and as others have stated I couldn't wait until the release of The Fiery Cross and to admit how terribly disappointed I am hurts a lot. Ms. Gabaldon was one of the first authors who made me appreciate the concept of time travel. I just wish I could travel through time and get her to do a rewrite to bring life to the characters I have loved for years and miss very much."
2,I waited so long for this???,"The first four books in the series were so gripping, so vivid and well written, so wonderfully spun, that I could do little else but read them for the few months it took me to get through them all. Then I sat on the edge of my seat, waiting for The Fiery Cross. I bought the book in November, and have finally given up on it. Put it away. I'm tremendously disappointed. I kept trying to love it. Or even to like it. Or to care about at least one of the characters...Perhaps when the next one is due I will pick it up and drag myself through the last third, just so I'll be able to give Diana Gabaldon and the characters another shot...but maybe I'm done with the series (how sad)"
3,A Visit With Friends,"The Fiery Cross is too long and it doesn't have much in the way of a climatic solution, but as an avid reader and fan, I still enjoyed my visit with Jamie and Claire. It's like seeing old friends again after a long absence. I hope that Diana, who is so very talented a storyteller, will allow her editor to become more involved in the next two books if only to keep her wonderful story lines on track. Claire's voice is strong in the novel and you will love getting inside her head as the number of people who know about her ability to travel through the stones grows. Of course, we are all still madly in love with Jamie!"
3,Big cliffhanger,"While the story is typical of the Outlander series, I am disappointed with the incompleteness of the story. I wonder if the author enjoys the persistent questions of when the next book will be published? If her response to the many queries are an indication, I would think rather not. Why then has she left herself open to another barage of queries as to when the next book will be finished? Also, the book lacked substance, the Ian and the Stephen Bonet storylines could have more depth. Don't misunderstand my cynicisim, I did relish the book and I admire D. Gabaldon's historical reasearch. Such talent and creativity is a dream of mine. But I was disappointed, I was anticipating a juicy Jamie and Claire adventure."
3,A disapppointment,"This book advanced the story of Claire and Jamie, but was a disappointing read. I was glad to see Roger's character develop, he was a bit flat until this book. Compared to other books in this series, the storyline moved sooo slowly. There were some twists and turns, but just not up to par for this author. Some themes were repetitve--how many times can Jamie almost be killed??? Far too many references to Jemmy's soiled diapers-- we get it-- enough please Diana. As a hardcore fan, I will buy the next two books. but I hope they are better."
2,Confused and Disappointed,"The Fiery Cross was a great disappointment. I skimmed the book the first time and then went back and read it again. It did not read like a Gabaldon book. The story was disjointed and did not move smoothly. Even the main characters were different. I appreciate that people change as they age, but would Jamie really have whined just because Clair wouldn't kiss him? His actions at Joscasta'a wedding were completely out of character. And what about Clair being worried about burning the clothes when Jamie was perhaps going to die? Then there's Furgus, has he been overlooked by Jamie now that Jamie has a son-in-law? Who by-the-way, is a jerk. The book doesn't fit with what has gone on in the other four books. The book just doesn't ring true.I really got the impression that Ms Gabaldon had to rush to get the book done in a short period of time. I hope she takes as much time as is needed to finish the next book."
1,"Plodding, not pleasing","I have truly enjoyed the four Outlander series book that preceeded The Fiery Cross. This latest book is a tedious disappointment. It is in dire need of an editor to trim perhaps half of the 1000 pages. The book lacks heart, and it sadly seems as if the author has merely gone through the motions, rather than being animated by her wonderful characters."
1,Couldn't make it to page 100....,It's been said already. I loved the others and got ready to be mesmerized and then plodded through nearly 100 pages - one chapter a night because I was bored to tears. Sorry - the saga is well over for me.
2,Where Was the Plot?,"Having read all of the previous books in this series, I was utterly disappointed with this latest effort. There was no plot, none of the excitement or adventure with which the other books held us captivated. It seemed as if this book was simply used to answer a few questions left from the earlier books and yet never did answer the one repeated in The Fiery Cross. (Who cares who Jemmy's father was?) It was worth reading simply because we care so much for the characters we grew to love in the previuos 4 novels. The Fiery Cross does not stand on it's own or live up to our great expectations. I hope the last in the series is better- I for one, would wait longer for a well planned novel."
3,Disappointing,"Maybe I built my hopes up too high, I don't know, but this book was not what I'd hoped it would be. I'm surprised so many of the reviews here mention problems I had with the book. Did it have to be quite so long? No; I saw much that could have been cut without consequence to the work.In addition to being too long, I was disappointed that nothing much is resolved. This book felt like filler, like DG had time to kill before the Revolution and so we got snippets of daily life.I love that Claire and Jamie are still in love; I still enjoy their relationship. I liked that Roger gets some development, but kept wondering how much hell the man could get himself involved in. It's one thing after another. Gabaldon doesn't have to use such tricks to keep me interested.Outlander is the best, an A+ book; I'd grade this one a C."
1,Is There an Editor in the House??,"What a disappointment! I thought that the first three in the series (Outlander, Dragonfly & Voyager) were well-written and innovative fiction, and Drums was fair-to-middling. Unfortunately, Fiery Cross is a saggy, baggy mass of largely extraneous details on life in 18th century North America, with some familiar characters tossed in. I sure am glad I read a library copy, and didn't pay for it. I'll probably read the next one, hoping that in the meantime Ms. Gabaldon will stop with the self-indulgent, unedited prose, and accept the advice (and pruning) of competent editors. Delacorte should be ashamed of themselves for letting this one loose on the public in this state."
2,Very disappointing,"I know the author probably feels chained to this saga, compelled by fans and publishing contracts to see it to the bitter end. The first three books were terrific (no, I take that back -- the first two were terrific, the third pretty darn good). Drums was OK, but Fiery Cross is almost unbearable. The author seems proud of her ability to write Vast Tomes, and I don't have an objection to VTs per se -- rather enjoy them, actually. But, that only works when the VTs have actual content. This book could have been half the size and still contain the story and plenty of lyrical description to boot.Yeah, I'll read the next one, but with trepediation -- and only because I'm a completist.P.S. For heavens' sake, send Bree, Roger, and Jem back through the stones and back to the 20th century where they belong."
5,The Fiery Cross (Outlander) series,"My grandson's wife had me borrow the Outlander book and i went on to the next. i'm on the fourth or fifth book , half way through it and i just can't put it down. I'm not getting my usual work done at home because i'm reading so much. i loved all of the books so far. Great stories.Shirley Belanger"
3,Slow start,"I have read all the previous books in this series, and I think it is now going just a tad too slow. I loved the series, but I'm getting bored,"
4,Great,"Love this series...second time I've read them, and now have read the 5th, 6th and 7th...clearly there will be an 8th since the author ONCE AGAIN (HATE IT that she does this) left a series of cliffhangers."
3,not the best of the series,"I really wanted to skip this book once I started reading it. It was not that great compared to all of them, but I didn't want to miss anything so I read on. I am glad I did, but I am glad it is over. I love this series that is why it got 3 stars, but this was a boring book to me. Not to say that there wasn't exciting parts because there was. But for the most part boring. sorry diana."
2,certainly not a page turner,I loved the first four books but this one is a snooze. No plot. No fleshing out of the story. All but the 4 main characters are just names on a page. I never found myself dieing for my kids to go to bed so I could pick up the Fiery Cross like I did for Outlander and the others. The only enjoyment I really got out of this book was that it freshened the characters and plots of the first four stories in my mind. That's the only reason I gave it two stars. Diana Gabaldon should try for quality and not quantity.
3,Once upon a time.......,"I finally made my way through this tome. I have read all five in the series within the last few months, so I have been able to do it with some continuity in the characters and plot lines. This is a delightful continuation of the saga, but I found it much more cumbersome than the previous volumes in the series. Thus it took me longer to read this one than the previous ones. The author is obviously showing some maturity in her writing since the first volume, but this one was definitely not my favorite. I found it plodding in many places and it seemed all too often mired in minutea at times when the plot needed to move along. Ms Gabaldon seems determined to hang on to some plot lines that would have been well-served to have been resolved and moved on to others. To take this many pages and only move the characters along such a short period of time was a bit disappointing. Still if you are a fan of the series it is worth the time to read it. But there is obviously more to come...."
2,What has happened Diana,"I honestly can't believe that the reviewer's that gavethis book 5 stars are legit!! (Friends of the editor maybe???)If there was one?? Yes I'm afraid I agree with the 95% ofreviewer's who were disappointed in this book, perhaps someoneelse has written this sequel? there seems no other logical explanation. Maybe Diana will redeem herself with the nextbook??"
3,"Why , oh why?","I must say I was most disappointed with this installment in the series. I agree with most of the other reviews and feel that this is just a filler until the next one comes out. Hopefully it won't take another 5 years. I didn't mind the more tranquil pace of this book; however, I did mind that many questions were left hanging. I felt a bit cheated as well. I read the book in about 3 days (I did have to continue with my real life too...LOL). Although, it was mostly due to my desire to find something interesting. The tedious first 300 pages or so could have been chopped. Otherwise, it is a fine read to get a dose of Jamie and Claire...I just wish there was more of them!"
2,Very disappointing,"Gone are the adventures that Diana created in her previous stories. The book was way too long, and virtually nothing happened.I quickly grew tired of the lengthy, overly descriptive style of writing Diana used with this book. I still love the characters- Claire and Jaime, but they went nowhere from page 1 on."
4,A wonderful addition to the series,"I have no idea why so many of the reviews of this book have been so negative - I found it to be a wonderful read, full of excitement, historical detail and beautiful writing. It is a long book - perhaps some readers are used to a fast fix when looking for good books? If you are a fan of this series, do not hesitate to purchase this book. It deserves a place of honor on your bookshelves, right next to the first four."
2,tedious and disappointing,"I have been an avid fan of the Outlander series....until this book. When I read the first four books,I barely slept so that I could find out what would happen next. The characters were fun and realistic, vibrant and exciting.""Fiery Cross"" was not a pleasurable read. Long-winded descriptions and passages without meaning seemed to be rampant throughout the book. I found it difficult to read for very long, and read several other books while FC sat on my nightstand.I hope that the next book returns to the enjoyable style of the first four."
2,What happened?,"I've been an avid fan ever since Outlander, and buy all these books in hardback. I've recommended them to others. So I impatiently awaited Fiery Cross. What a disappointment! Colonial America is an interesting era, and the characters are certainly well known and loved. There was a wealth of material to work with. But this book did little to advance the story line. I could find little in the way of a plot, and don't enjoy reading all the details of ""bathroom functions"" and breast feeding. I can see no reason for the entire ""Aunt Jocasta"" segment(s), which absorb much of the space, and am really tired of Brianna and Roger's marital problems. Why did they marry at all?? We all know Diana Gabaldon can do much better!"
1,Long Awaited - and dispointed,"I loved the first three books, reading them twice through. I thought books 4 & 5 not as good, however still interesting. I waited so long and was so excited for The Firery Cross to be released. I bought it as soon as it was available. I am very dispointed in the book. Jamie and Claire have lost their spark. The interplay between them is nothing like the first books. I really missed that. They are now boring. The book had entirly too much detail about day to day life and could have had about 300 pages cut and you would not have missed a thing. I hope Diana G. Can get back some of the spark in her future books."
2,Diana Delivers A Somewhat Disappointing Story,"I am an avid fan of the OUTLANDER series so, for me, it was somewhat surprising that years after purchasing the book I have found it so tedious that I STILL have not finished reading it.It lies on the headboard of my bed. I occasionally blow the dust off the cover and read a few pages before falling asleep.This book does not deliver the romance, supspense or excite of the earlier books. Had this book been the first in the series I would not have read the second.I am looking forward to Ms.Gabaldon's next novel in the series ""A Breath of Snow and Ashes""...let's hope that it brings a Breath of Life back to the storyline."
3,Rather Disappointed,"Because I have read all the previous books in the Outlander series, this one came as a disappointment. While Gabaldon's previous books were packed with action and suspense, The Fiery Cross never developed a strong plot, thus never had a strong climax, leaving the reader empty come the end of the book. I can't say I was truly upset that the book never picked up; Jamie and Claire have been though so much drama they deserved a break, but there just wasn't a strong plot in the book. Minor crises occur keeping the reader hooked for several chapters, but the book was lacking a major problem in need of resolve, making it difficult to keep interest. If you're an Outlander fan, I recommend reading The Fiery Cross solely for the purpose of fully enjoying A Breath of Snow and Ashes, which will hopefully be more satisfying."
4,and so the saga continues,"At a clan gathering in the mountains of North Carolina, Brianna and Roger are finally married.Jamie is ordered by the Governor to form a militia of his tenants, which causes a sense of uneasiness among everyone.In the course of a minor conflict between the Governors militia and the ""regulators"", who are the free settlers,trying to achieve independence, Roger is captured and hanged. Fortunately, Jamie and Claire rescue him in time, but the terrible injuries left on his throat, ensure that his singing days are over.Claire's knowledge of the oncoming revolution places her in a unique position, and she tries to prepare the colony at Frasers Ridge for the future, ,at the same time, using her medical skills to preserve the health and happiness of her family and friends. This book, although fascinating, wasn't quite as exciting as the previous 4 (although, how many adventures CAN be packed in?) and I'm sure that it's a stepping stone to book 6 and the revolution."
2,So disappointed,I could not wait for the next book in the Outlander series. Boy was I disappointed. This reads like a very bad romance novel.I sure hope her next one will be in tune with the original style of the series.
1,Sheesh,"IT BLEW. I read the other novels like, four times over. I was so excited to see this new installment in the bookstore, i shrieked with delight (and received several dirty looks from Barnes and Noble patrons). Since others have been so vocal about their disappointment as well, this is moot point, but I had to vent-- it bit. REALLY HARD. Diana Gabaldon owes me almost 30 dollars for this book (when it first came out), and days of my life. OK, i'm done now."
3,Disappointed so far ...,I was so excited to get this book and so far I am disappointed. I've read the first 150 pages and we are still on the first day. I seriously hope all of this detail will be important later in the book. At this point I am debating whethter this book was ever edited. The descriptions seem a bit more romance novelly than I remember.I hope this gets better....
1,Gabaldon-A Driving Force,"Diana Gabaldon is a driving force in the romance novel business and has so many levels of intellect-YEAH RIGHT!!!!!!!!!I would rather have really bad indigestion than go and buy another one of these boring books.I think people contemplating buying one of these books should go buy a red hot chilli peppers cd,nirvana's nevermind,Pearl Jam's ten,or go buy the movie Looking For Ali Brandy,or if you are still interested in reading pick up a copy of Anthony Kiedis's Bio Scar tissue out next fall,and if it's fiction you are into well go to the Library and pick out a book instead of spending your money on this waste of time."
4,What a Read!,"I loved it. I appreciated every word that Diana Galbaldon lovingly researched and wrote. I felt I was reading 5 books with five subjects instead of one. I loved the way she took me up and down like an ocean swell. Having read the other reviews, I wonder of we are in a world of ""instant read"" and have forgotten how to take our time. Congratulations, Diana. I now know about American History, Natural Medicine and a way of life long gone."
5,Continuation of Jamie and Claire,"To all the lovers of Diana Gabaldon this book is great!!! If you loved Jamie and Claire through all the other books you will love this one. I have been on the waiting list for this book since July. It takes off where it left off, with Jamie and Claire in America. It goes through the hardships , and leads to the American revolution. I haven't finished the book yet , but it is a treasure. I love her books so much that I keep them stored away to read again someday. You also read about Brianna , Roger her husband and son Jemmy. Buy this book!!!!"
1,"Long, slow journey","I was very disappointed in the latest Jamie/Claire installment. It was long, tedious and just not worth the effort. I enjoyed some of the scenes immensely, however, the parts I enjoyed could have been told in 300 or so pages and not 900+. If you are an avid fan, you will need to read it, but if you've only felt so-so about the whole Outlander saga, then don't bother. I really hope the next book is at least half as good as Outlander - then it will be a fantastic book."
2,Endlessly Slogging,"I had lots of trouble getting through this one. It seemed like an interminable collection of endless details. The obsession with leaking breasts and dirty diapers, while tolerable at first, became revolting.I fell in love with Outlander the first time I read it. It was tightly plotted, the characters were fascinating, and there was a sense of movement and plot development. The time travel aspect was superb! But each book in the series became more wordy, with endless, unbelievable, minor characters. Still, the others were satisfying. But this one was pure flab. The plot hardly advanced, the central time-travel element was almost nil, and the tedious baby poop details tried my patience to the utmost.The author is fabulously talented, but she needs to edit, edit, edit."
2,Where was her editor?,"I too have nothing to say that hasn't been said before, I am hoping that Ms. Gabaldon will tune into these reviews and get the point that even the truest of fans can become tired of the same old thing. This book was so boring that I went out and bought the audio book just so I could finish it (I find listening sometimes easier than reading). I am not sure how she made Claire and Jamie so uninteresting - but she did. Ms. Gabaldon, please make the next book half as long as The Fiery Cross and re-read your first book and give us fans what we know and love."
1,Possibly the Most Boring Book I've Ever Read,"If you're reading this review, I'm assuming you've already read (or at least read reviews of) the rest of Diana Gabaldon's ""Outlander"" series. This is the fifth book. You could skip straight from ""Voyager"" (the third book) to ""A Breath of Snow and Ashes"" (the sixth), avoiding ""Drums of Autumn"" and ""The Fiery Cross"" entirely without missing a thing. ""Drums of Autumn"" is pretty boring. ""The Fiery Cross"" is completely boring. Between ""Voyager"" and ""A Breath of Snow and Ashes"" Jamie and Claire settle in the mountains of North Carolina. That's all you need to know but if you're a glutton for punishment: ""The Fiery Cross"" focuses on the obscure ""War of the Regulation,"" a precursor to the American Revolution that reflected rumblings of discontent with British rule in the colonies. Bree and Roger have marital difficulties. Jemmy has poopy diapers. Claire performs medical miracles."
2,What a disappointment,"Like many others who have written here, I absolutely loved the previous installments of the Outlander series. To my dismay, I could not finish this one, after having devoured the others. As others haver already articulated what is wrong with this book, I add my voice in the hope that the author monitors these reviews and will give us another great Jamie and Clair story next time. (And please send Roger and Brianna back! The back and forth between modern times and the past, and the linking of characters in the present to those in the past were some of the most enjoyable parts of the other books.)"
2,The Longest Story ever Told,After three weeks I was still reading about the same Day! It took me over two months to read this book because it kept putting me to sleep. I adored the other four books and have read them three times (The only books I have ever re-read). I was disappointed Brianna did not use more of her 20th century MIT education to improve life in the 1770's. I would have expected her to have at least figured out how to provide indoor plumbing to the cabin or how about solar heating? There are so many more interesting things she could have been doing besides breast feeding through an entire book. I don't have to worry about waiting for the next edition to this story. It will take me five years to forget the torture of this one.
2,Wait for the paperback,"The book was slowing moving and predictable. I'm unsure why I held out until the end. Maybe I was expecting something to happen, it didn't. The characters I knew and loved became very unrealistic. Jamie takes on godhood. Claire, over 50, is fighting off men half her age. Brianna and Roger seem to have some sort of sexual hangup in one chapter that is suddenly forgotten in subsequent chapters. What a waste of my money and my time. I'm hoping Jean Auel's book is not such a disappointment."
2,"Get this woman a new editor, PLEASE!","This book was at least 500 pages too long. Too much trivial info - at least 25 pages wasted on changing Jemmy's diapers & breast feeding. Has the author forgotten the concept of ""PLOT""??This book has way too much padding. Please make the next one shorter & to the point. I'm sure glad I didn't pay money for this book! Borrow it from your public library if you must read it, is my advice!!"
2,Tedious Maximus,"I am sorry to say that I have to concur with so many other fans of the Outlander series. I have found myself, several times, gritting my teeth with something like bored exasperation. The others were, for the most part, so compelling that I could not put them down, even much of the previous book. I'm going to leave off this one and hope for better with the next."
3,Disappointed fan,I had truly looked forward to continuing my acquaintance with Claire and Jamie. The first four books were enthralling but this one was a disappointment. I finally ended up buying the abridged audio CD version and found that easier to wade through.
2,"In a word, BORING.","I waited with eager anticipation the arrival of this book on the day of its release, like I've waited for no book previously. I couldn't wait to dig in. After reading Outlander, which could arguably be the best book I've ever read (and I've read tons), then the other 3 which were great in their own right, I had expected nothing short of greatness from The Fiery Cross. Boy, was I sorely disappointed. Was there an editor reviewing this tomb? I really can't believe it was published. It took me 6 weeks to plow thru the 979 pages and until the end I was still waiting for a plot. It had a ton of mini subplots but put together all you get is day-to-day life on Fraser's Ridge. Where's the adventure, the romance, the growth of characterization? I'm giving this 2 stars because it was good to be among the Fraser's & MacKenzie's again, and because Diana is still a creative writer."
2,Slogging through 979 pages,"I love the Outlander series, but this book nearly did me in. I had to force myself to finish it. The story started to be engaging around page 600, but then it got awful again. Gabaldon got so bogged down in the minutiae of 18th century colonial life that I missed the plot points (if they were even there). Also, since there was such a long break between installments, it would have been helpful to have a little backstory included --- but that probably would have entailed another 500 pages! I'll get the next one from the library, but that's her last chance!"
3,Really should be 2.5 stars,"I've followed the series from book one. Jamie and Claire are two of my favorite fictional characters. Yet, I can't get past the half way point of this book. I even jumped a head, hoping something would encourage me to go back and read the missed pages.There are spots where the writing sings. Phrases, passages that remind me of the earlier works. Then it sags...or too many pages. I love detail, but this is overkill on detail. Within a couple pages the reader is given the same details of a gun. This happens in too many spots.The more mature Jamie and Claire didn't bother me. Even Roger and Brianna were fine.Yes, I'll try the next installation. And possibly even finish this book. But I miss the fun that I had with the first four."
3,"It was ""okay""","Let me first say that I adore the Outlander series, and have heartily recommended it to everyone I meet...however, I feel that the series hit a brick wall with this book. Despite the fact that I think Ms. Gabaldon is a wonderful writer, the book gets so weighed down in details that the plot just plods along. I read the book before reading some of the negative reviews, and was relieved to see that other Gabaldon fans were as disappointed as I. By all means, read this book as the next installation in a beloved series, just don't expect the burning passion and excitement of some of the previous books. And expect a lot more Brianna, which is fine for her fans, but for the rest of us who find her incredibly annoying, it's painful."
3,Enjoyed it but not as much as the others,"After reading Diana Gabaldon, it is always hard for me to switch to traditional fluffy romance novels. She has a special way of weaving a tale that I have always enjoyed. However, while I enjoyed reading this book, I did not like it as much as the others. It took me a while to get into the book as a good portion of the beginning takes place over just a few days. I also did not like the depth that she went into on the babies. My guess is a lot of people read these books to escape from babies, and don't want to be reminded of their crying, etc while reading. All in all it was a nice read, but not as good as the others. I still anxiously await the next installment."
2,The Much-Anticipated 5th Book Fails to Deliver,"The long wait between Gabaldon's last book and this one in the Outlander series was definitely NOT worth it. This continuation of the Jaime/Claire and Brianna/Roger story leaves much to be desired. It never really goes anywhere and fails to offer the historical interest that made her other books great reads. The ""romance"" has gone out of this one as well -- the protagonists spend more time worrying about the outcome of intimacy than they do actually being intimate. I've always associated Gabaldon with a higher caliber of romance novel -- she's usually much more intellectual than what one normally finds under the ""romance"" category -- but this particular book hardly qualifies. I was very disappointed."
2,a big setup for the next book,"Really really disappointing, though still well written.More like a travel guide to life 230 years ago than a novel.some good moments, but I am really not all that interested in Brianna and Roger. They are too durned perfect.Lots of plot threads got started, but this whole book was a big set up for the next book.Not sorry I read it, but an essential element seems to be missing."
3,Waiting for something to happen,"I love the story of Jamie and Claire, and I eagerly anticipated Fiery Cross. However, I kept waiting for something to happen. Things really got going the last 150 pages or so, and from visiting websites devoted to Diana Gabaldon's books, I understand that this book was so long she had to split it into two. So there will be two more books, not one.It's almost like she ended Drums of Autumn too early, and since it was too soon for the Revolutionary War, she had to fill time. I am rereading her early books again, just because I love the story, but I think most people could skip this one and go straight to book 6."
3,Disappointed,"After waiting so long for the next installement, I'm not sure I'll even finish the Fiery Cross. Brianna is, as ever, irritating. Tedious detail and conversation, dotted with short bits of intrigue that are left suddenly to more swashbuckling sexual banter between the Frasers. Chapter upon chapter are filled with minute details of one event, and the characters don't seem to be going anywhere, literally or mentally.Disappointing. Maybe it's time to start the new series with the time-travelling French Apothecary from Dragonfly in Amber.Perhaps the author was put under too much pressure to produce the next installement.I'll still buy the next novel, I love time travel stories and there isn't that much selection for adults!"
2,Don't Judge the Series by this Book,"I loved the rest of this series, but this one is so boring I tried twice to read it, but both times got so bored with it I couldn't finish. But don't judge the whole series on this book. Read all the others. You'll enjoy those!"
1,I waited for this???,"I couldn't wait to get this book. I preordered it and lept in excitement when it came in the mail. Then I started to read it. It is hopelessly boring, slow, and uninteresting, to say the least. I have read all the other books in the series and this one doesn't compare. What happened, Diana?! I definitely won't be reading the next one if it's anything like this. I want my old Jamie back with a dynamic Claire. Send Brianna through the stones and lose her forever along with Jemmy."
1,Is there a plot?,"I don't think I can finish this book and I'm on page 600 something. *yawn* Is there a plot here? Yes, certain passages have kept me going. Claire describing how she felt with menstrual cramps, wanting to 'run amok and slaughter everyone in sight' was charming and enough to make me want to read on, but I just can't do it.As others have stated, the breastfeeding thing is way overdone. I'm sick and tired of hearing about it, and when Claire jumped on the bandwagon and felt her own breasts 'tingling' with some child howling I slammed the book shut. Enough.The Outlander was my favorite book of all time. I fell in love with Jamie, the man of everyone's dreams, and Claire's courage had me enchanted. Diana, you just didn't have your heart into this one. This series should have stopped two books ago with Jamie and Claire in old age, maybe with a epilogue of Brianna putting flowers on their graves.. whatever. This just didn't cut it."
2,Missed The Boat,"I too loved the first 4 books which I read 2 times each. I live with a modern version of Jamie and being the mother of 6 children spread over a 25 year span, I don't need to read about their bodily functions again, and again. Diana, you missed the boat on this book, dropped the ball, slept though most of it. I had to force myself to read until the end and it took nearly a month to just pick it up long enough to finally get interested. Your writing style of not writing in a flowing matter but bits and pieces then put together later, which I have admired until now, shows too much in this book as to why it's not the proper way to write. Will I buy the next book, of course, but if it doesn't get there it will be the last. I'll just read the first ones again and come up with my own version for the next book. Try harder."
3,Slow But True,"Diana's 5th book in the Outlander series is very slow to start. I believe after waiting 4 years for this book, the anticipation may have spoiled her fans. I found that there were many chapters that she could have deleted (but her publisher probably wanted them). There are other chapters that are very interesting and continue to keep the reader's attention. The book definitely picked up toward the end, and, now, I can't wait for the next one. I would have given Diana more stars, but this book was somewhat disappointing compared with her other stories of Claire and Jamie, Brianna and Roger."
2,missed the mark,"wonderful tale of frontier life, but face it, claire and jamie are old now, bree is a shrew, and there are far too many baby scenes in this book. maybe the last book will have more action, and less wandering around the woods chopping fire wood. what really annoyed me was the action in the last chapter, that should have showed up much earlier in the book, and given us something to enjoy."
3,Disappointing...,"As a whole, the Outlander series is a beautiful and wonderful epic love story that happens to have adventure, sex, time travel, etc. However, I found this one to be a little disappointing (I read them in order.) At times it was too lenghty and too much time took place between events in the story. At times I found myself struggling to get through it, when the others were much more captivating. It is obvious that Diane Gabaldon is truly talented with her story telling abilities, but she should realize that not EVERY story needs to be stretched out to 900 pages. Regardless, I eagerly await the next installment in the series and can't wait to find out the next challenges that Jamie and Claire will face..."
3,For Outlander diehards only,"This volume is for true diehard fans of Gabaldon's previous books. If you really want to know what happens to Claire & Jamie (not a whole lot), read this. Otherwise, spend your time on the first few, unforgettable volumes. The gem events in this book could have been captured in half the 1,000 page count. Some key details come together in this book which is why it is rated 3 and not 2 stars."
2,All Prose - No Plot,"What a disappointment! I loved the first 4 books in this series so much, I've read them all at least 3 times and will eventually read them again just for fun. The excitement, adventure and plot twists were topped only by the detailed historical data. While The Fiery Cross had plenty of historical data (although this book seemed to be really hung up on how things smell), it offered absolutely nothing in the form of excitement and adventure, or even plot for that matter. Diana is a wonderful writer, but her talents were completely wasted on this novel. Perhaps it's time to put Jamie and Claire to rest."
1,Managed the Impossible - I no longer care! : - (,"Sorry to just reiterate what most of the reviewers have already said, but I wanted to cast my vote. I didn't finish this book despite sincere intentions. I just didn't have the heart to slog through any more, and sounds like I didn't miss much. What Gabaldon seems to have lost is that incomparable ability to make you CARE desperately what happens next. Voyager just about killed me, I was so anxious to see Claire return to Jamie. The instant where she finds him again in his printing shop ended the series for me. The circle was complete. Sure, his reunion with his daughter was important but nothing has returned that sense of breakneck urgency. Life isn't like that, but a great story should be. Otherwise it's just ""Moonlighting"" after Bruce and Cybil had sex."
2,like Star Wars Episode II,"I loved Star Wars as a kid. However, when Episode I came out, I was very disappointed, because it seemed as though the focus was on all the wrong things--the annoying details instead of plot development and character interaction.Well, that's how I felt reading Drums of Autumn, and Fiery Cross is like Episode II--the lameness continues.Outlander and Dragonfly in Amber were wonderful books; Voyager was excellent up until about the middle; then the series began to decline for me. So many useless details that contribute nothing!Fiery Cross was the last blow though; diapers, leaky breasts, forever and ever. The writing has definitely lost its wit too--which was a large part of the joy of these books.I hope A Breath of Snow and Ashes is the redemption--like SW Episode III.PS: Why can't the story go back to Scotland? I hated American History in high school, for heaven's sake! I don't want to read about it again!"
2,Expectations Dashed,"I'm afraid to say it... I was very disappointed in this one. Like everyone else who is a huge fan of Ms. Gabaldon, I was anxiously awaiting the release of The Fiery Cross; unfortunately it just doesn't do her writing (or her reputation) justice. Maybe I am more of a fan of the younger Jamie and Claire (Outlander and Dragonfly in Amber), I'm finding Bree and Roger whiny and uninteresting and I am sick of Aunt Jostica and the everyday life in the wilderness. This latest book is very similar to Voyager, in that the details are overwhelming.I recently went to a book signing where Ms. Gabaldon said that there will be at least two more books in this series. I hope that she can bring back more of the excitement and adventure that her fans enjoyed in her previous books. Until then, it will be back to the first two books for me."
2,It Could Have Been Great,"I have read everything that Diana has written (well, almost) and I have to say that I would have preferred to save my money. I love her rich detail and characters, but this book had absolutely no plot. I was half way into the book when I started to scratch my head and say ""why?"". It seems as if it is a filler book. 400 some odd pages and Brianna still isn't married and it is still the same darn day! Anyone who has read the first four books knows without a doubt that Clair and Jamie love one another I felt as if I was being hit over the head with it. I thought maybe the reason for the book would be to get Stephen Bonnett, but alas no. Because I am such a fan I will read the other books, but I will not be standing in line to receive the first one they hand out."
1,Wanted: Editor with a Heavy Hand,"Is Diana Gabaldon being paid by weight? I enjoyed the early books in this saga very much. She is a talented writer and the story has a lot of intrinsic interest. She has a large group of devoted followers who are hungry to continue with the characters. But we are given a pile of pages with no coherent story, no dramatic energy and far too many words. Get it at the library and skim it, if you have to find out what's going on. You'll find that not much is."
1,Boring!!!!,"I loved the other books in the series, so I got this one the day it came out in 2001. I've been trying to read it since 2001! There is too much detail and no plot. I don't need to know how they changed diapers for 128 pages or so. The only interesting thing so far was about the Friesian horses, and that didn't last very long.Another thing that gets me is, who wants to read about this cool Scottish guy who is never in Scotland?I'll pass on the next book."
2,A Very Slow Moving Book,"I am commenting on the unabridged audio book....I was dissapointed in this story. In fact I never made it past the 3rd of 6 tapes. The story was slow moving, and by the 3rd tape you were still not sure what the basic plot line was. It was sort of like watching someone's boring life. There was a lot of good description of the area and the medicine of the time but the overall story was too slow for me.In fact if I hadn't re-read the back of the box I wouldn't have understood which people went back through time.I was dissapointed."
1,Too Boring to Be So Long,"I am slogging through the latest Jamie/Claire saga. It is a huge disappointment. Unlike her past books which I finished too quickly and wanted more, I now want less and can't wait to get it over with. What a shame. There's no magic here."
1,terrible,I tried and tried to read this book (cause I pd soooo much for it) and did NOT like this book AT ALL> Could not get into it...YUCK
4,I'm in love with Jamie all over again,"I laughed, I cried, and fell in love with Jamie, again (just when I thought I was over him). I just hope Diana doesn't take so long with the next book!!"
3,The Fiery Cross (Audio Cassette),"Hello,I have contacted you on two previous occasions. I sent the cassettes back three weeks ago, but have not received a credit on my account as of yet. Please let me know what the status is?"
1,Booooorrrrriiinnnnggg!,"I picked this up in a bookstore overseas for a train trip. It would have been nice if the publishers had mentioned that it was the Nth book in a series... I'd have at least hunted for the first one instead of coming in at what is apparently the tail end.Having read this one, I have no desire to read any more in the series, except perhaps as an antidote for insomnia. Lots and lots and lots of writing, no story. But I did get something out of it. Thanks to this book I now have a really... I mean REALLY... I mean >thouroughly-drummed-in< concept of the physiolgical details of what the human female experieces during lactation. Yow!z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z"
2,She's run out of steam,"I was really looking forward to this book as I have read and re-read the others so many times, but now that the time travel aspect is just about used up all we have left is just another ""bodice ripper"" with some medical details to pad it out.What a disappointment."
4,Just as good as the rest in the series.,"I was just as engrossed in this book as in the rest of her books. Her descriptions are very colorful and put you right at the place. I was disappointed that this book doesn't get to the Revolution, but this way I know there will be another book to follow."
2,Yawn,"I've had this book since November and am loathe to finish it. I feel like I've read over half, but in reality I've only read 1/4! Does Diana secretly wish she went to medical school? I am bitterly disappointed at the long and completely unncessary medical descriptions. WHO CARES?! Unfortunately, this was a gift from my husband so I have to finish it at some point. Pick up a Sharon Kay Penmen book for a better read...."
3,Loved the series,"Yes I loved the series totally and feel in love with the people and Scotland, but I had to force myself to read this last book and found myself skipping many paragraphs as I got bored.I did feel let down with this book but I still had to know what happened to Claire and Jamie.:-) Still if you are a fan of this series, you have to read it.PS: Gosh I felt poor Roger gets a raw deal in the last two books! I would have thought Roger, Brianna and their child would have gone back to their time (I would have!)"
4,Still Going Strong,"(...) The book feels more like a bridge than a saga of its own and I didn't enjoy it quite as much as the original Outlander or the last volume Drums of Autum. However, I love Jamie, Claire, Roger and Brianna and I am willing to read whatever Diana wants to write about them. I love how she captures the everday details of life in the 1770's and I love the intimate and revealing conversations she gives her characters. She knows them inside and out and she makes me want to spend as much time as possible with them. (...)"
3,Gets better at the end,"Like most reviewers this was not my favorite book of the Outlander series. It started out way too slow and all the details about The Gathering and the upcoming weddings of Bree and Roger, and Jocasta and Duncan drug on forever. I definitely feel like I would have missed a lot of the story if I had skipped this book. Without giving away too much of the plot it did get begin to really grab my attention when two of the main characters nearly died and when one character returned to the Ridge. More about Otter Tooth's story was also very interesting. I can't wait to start the next installment."
5,Another amazing installment in the lives of Claire and James.,"I am so hooked on this series that I panic if I don't find the next installment before I finish the one before. I usually look locally, but this time I was fortunate to find a hard cover copy at a great price. It came in a hurry and in great condition. I suppose I could buy them two or three ahead, but then I might be tempted to jump ahead in the story.This series of books is fascinating. It combines history, romance, time travel, a lot of human drama and even humor. I've never been so transported. It is literally like stepping back in time. The descriptions of life in the various times is so vivid that it's more like a watching a movie than reading a book.Whether you are a romance fan, a historic buff, (especially interested in Scotland and Early America), or a sci-fi enthusiast, this series will fulfill your needs for a great read.Note: this series is for mature readers as some of the accounts of sex and violence are a bit graphic."
5,The Fiery Cross (Outlander),"I've enjoyed all of the books in this series, and this one is no exception. Diane Gabaldon is quite inventive, and I appreciate that she does not take liberties with history."
5,Wonderful Saga,Diana Gabaldon is an incredible story teller. I especially like the way she weaves the story through real history of both Scotland and America. I can't wait to turn the next page and see what Claire and Jamie have gotten into this time.
3,Not the best of the series,"I finally got through ""The Fiery Cross"" and I have to say - it isn't my favorite. It was laborious reading. It wasn't really a story on it's own, but more like a series of short stories of life on Fraser's Ridge in and around 1771. Not bad, but not the page turner that the other books have been. I'm gonna take a break from the Outlander series now that I've finally finished Fiery Cross. I will come back and read the next installment later. This one just wasn't as much fun to read."
5,Don't let the bad reviews sway you!!!!,"Jamie and Clare's life are never boring for me! I definitely disagree with others here: this book is definitely not boring. In fact, there is a lot of drama in this book. Sure, this book doesn't have like a huge event centering it (like the previous books) but that doesn't mean it's uneventful. This book is definitely more centered on character development and the relationships among the characters. I enjoy that this book is simpler than the others: it's nice for Jamie and Claire to have somewhat of a normal life and be happy most of the time. We see more of Roger and Brianna here as well. I enjoyed this read and look forward to more from Diana!"
5,Crazy for Outlander,Just finished Re-reading the entire series. This is the second to last book and what a way to top off the series but with another book. Hopefully Ms. Gabledon will keep it going so we may see what lies ahead for Jamie and Claire in more high adventure.
4,It really isn't that bad!,"This book seems to get a lot of bad reviews, but I really didn't think it was that bad. It wasn't the best, but it hardly deserves some of the reviews it has gotten. Yes, it is a bit slower paced, but it still has a lot of character development (mainly Roger and Bree, and I still don't like Bree, but that's neither here nor there). It depends on whether you're comparing them to the rest of the series or the rest of books in general. I personally don't think anything will ever top Outlander, but I definately don't think she dropped the ball on this one either."
3,"Stirred, not shaken","Diana G. has become a prisoner of her own success. The other four books were so innovative that she'll find it hard to measure up to them. TFC contained Diana's usual excellent writing, but there was very little narrative drive; few questions to compel me to turn the pages. I knew there was war coming, but it never arrived. I knew Stephen Bonnet was a threat, but he never arrived until the last minute, then the scallawag got away, feeling like a cliffhanger just to drive me to buy the next book. Jamie still has the power to make me cry, Claire is still . . . Claire. But the pages of this one don't fly because there is no looming threat to keep the reader engrossed. But I hold great hope for King, Farewell--and will be happy to have the story finally finished."
4,Not my favorite of Diana Gabaldon's Outlander Series,"I'll just say that I gave this four stars out of obligation. It was important because if gives some background information and sets up alot of the plot in the next book; however, this was by far the hardest book for me to get through. What happens is that in some of her books it begins really good and then towards the middle you feel like you are mucking through and then at the end she leaves you with this cliffhanger that you just have to pick the next one up to find out about. Like I said, not my favorite and maybe too drawn out, but I still love these books and will be sorry to see them go. I'm just wondering how far they will go. Will it be after Jamie dies (he WAS the ghost in her window that Frank saw in the first book)?"
2,"I'm halfway through, and it is SOOOO boring!","I am the biggest fan of Gabaldon and was so excited to get this book. Oh boy, oh boy, is it a snoozer! The writing is good, and the detail is great. However, there is such a thing as WAY too much detail. I even skipped over and read the end, and it wasn't any better!You know how Gabaldon always says that she writes in bits and pieces and then somehow glues it all together? It really shows in this book. Long, descriptive passages with very little action makes for a very, very slow, almost nonexistent story. It's as though she goes from one extremely detailed sequence to another with really NOTHING happening in the story.Where is the action? The romance? The time travel? The visits from characters in previous novels? The tying-together of storylines across the novels? Alas, it is gone.It is as though it is nearly a thousand pages of descriptive, nauseatingly boring detail in preparation for future novels. (...)"
2,A Prelude to Book Six?,"I absolutely love the Outlander Series. And I will buy Book Six because I have the entire set in hardback. However....The Fiery Cross was pointless, even as a prelude to Book Six. Gabaldon should have jumped straight into the American Revolution, I kept waiting. This book has no plot and the numerous minor storylines it does have are not necessary. If any of them needed to be told to set the stage for the American Revolution, it could have been done in a few pages, not more than 900. Stephen Bonnet is boring and uninteresting and far too much time has been devoted to exacting revenge on him. His story certainly isn't interesting enough to carry all the way through the Fiery Cross and I assume into Book Six since it apparently isn't over YET. I hate to write a bad review on this because this is my favorite series and the one I recommend to everybody. It doesn't seem Gabaldon was into the book either since she never developed a plot."
2,Incredibly weighed down,"Unfortunately, this book was so burdensome, I gave up on reading it... And I'm an English teacher used to reading Shakespeare. Her books are usually very good. I gave it a good try, I read at least 11 chapters. There were too many names, too many words in other languages, too much history, too much cultural references... Just too much. I love the Claire and Jamie story but there was very little of that and I gave up continuing reading it, waiting for those brief moments."
1,The Fiery Cross (Outlander) by Diana Gabaldon,"I am very disappointed with this book, 5th in the Outlander series. There is no direction, it meanders along from one meaningless scenario to another, I have put it down and won't finish this book. Very rare for me, I was persevering with it, but it was too annoying.The Fiery Cross (Outlander)"
2,The Fiery Cross,"Book 5 of the Outlander series was not as gripping as the previous 4 novels. I was forewarned before starting this book but I continued with it all the same. For continuity, I persevered. I cannot image how difficult it must be to maintain the momentum of Books 1 (Outlander) and 2 (Dragonfly in Amber) which were by far the best for me."
2,Enjoyed this series...until now,"Amazon recommended ""Voyager"" and I found that hard to begin but really had fun with it after the first 150 pages. I thought the previous editions in this series were much more enjoyable. This was beyond mundane for nonfiction. I do not think the character development remotely compares to prior books. Should I continue? Does anyone have any thoughts?Thank you."
2,Will This Ever Get Exciting ???,"How could Gabaldon have done this to all of us, her loyal readers? Yes, to be added to Ripley's Believe It Or Not, she has bored me to tears - tears of frustration and disappointment.What would ever make her think that after four marvelous novels we would want to hear again and again and again about her grandson's diapers or her daughter's leaking breasts? For the first time I felt a real lack of concern for what happens to them all. As is often the case, I wanted to jump into the novel to talk to the characters, but this time I wanted to bellow, ""DO SOMETHING!"" I will continue to recommend Gabaldon's novels to everyone I know, and I look forward to the next novel. However, I pray that the entire novel to come will be as interesting and exciting as merely a few parts of this novel ever was."
2,beyond dissappointed,"This is the first review I have ever done. I was so frustrated and dissappointed with this book, I had to struggle to finish it...just in case there was SOME redeeming bit I might miss. There wasn't. What happened to the basic premise of the series, that of Jamie and Clare?? If D.G. was just using this book as a filler so that she can continue the series and prolong the story, well then she did it. The book drags on and on with MORE than enough informatin about Clare's medical skills and the day to day living of the colonists. This isn't a bad thing, but, almost a 1000 pages of it? It could have been edited into a 300 page book and told the same exact story, with less words. This took 4 years to write? I am still hopeing that her next book in the series will go back to her original style and substance. I also hope it won't take another 4 years. I'd like to see how Jamie and Clare end their story, but not if it takes any more of this BORING filler stuff!"
2,"Too long, not much happens.","What a disappointment! Most of this book was written about tedious daily life. The flashes of interesting action are few and far between. It was all I could do to finish the book. And worse, despite the length of this book, not much is resolved or even tied in well! More happened in one chapter in the Outlander than in this entire book. After so many pages, I feel I have learned little more than I knew from the last book, and have only more questions or loose ends. It is annoying. Also, the method of writing it from not only Claire and Brianna's point of view, but also from Roger's, was choppy and not interesting to me. Save your time and money, and have someone sum it up, or mark the few interesting passages for you to read."
2,Boring,"Since I mostly read for enjoyment, I don't like to criticize a book. Whatever it's faults, I usually just go along with it for the fun. But this book--well, I'm not quite half way through it and don't know how much further I can make myself go with this trivia. I'm writing this review when I would normally be reading; I didn't want to read the book, so I came back here to complain. What, should I carry on? Can somebody assure me that the trivia will be justified in the pages to come? Will I think it was all worth the trouble?Elinore"
4,"worth the money, good game...but","closer to 4 1/2 stars. this is a unique game in the view point and is also close to being a survival horror game. This is also the first game i ever seen use Hallucination sequences that you actually control (like walking in a dream) what has kept me from giving this game a 5 so far (and im still playing it)is the fact that ive play a good chunk of this game and it has mainly been all indoors. It would be nice to get some scenery here and there. Walking the endless buildings and halls can get old after awhile. Other than this, this game is awsome, and at the price you can not go wrong."
1,Once Again 1st Person Character Games Are Annoying.,"I like the story, nice action packed fast paced the character is actually attractive. But the 1st person play is not very much fun for me. But is in Excellent condition."
2,I died,"It was too hard on easy mode. It's a first-person shooter with the combat engine geared towards martial arts... but in such a way that guns are still the most lethal, and most logical, option.The concept is interesting, but the playability is close to nil, and winds up having an ""overdone"" feeling. Objects are hard to use... you have to stand *just right*, and you have to press once to pick up, once again to accept, and once more to use any object. I'm sure there's a compelling conspiracy story in there somewhere... there almost always is with the Archetypal Amnesiac Adventure Hero made popular in the early 90's by ""Total Recall,"" but the white-on-white text makes it very difficult to read what it is.I really wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, but enough people seem to like it that it may be worth a shot."
2,How counterintuitive can you get?,"The first moment i realized i wasn't going to like this game was the first time i tried to pick up an extra clip of ammo. While i am being shot at, my character calmly picks up the clip and proceeds to stare at it and examine it in his hand, WHILE I AM BEING SHOT AT. Its the general counterintuitive nature of things like that in this game that really bothered me, moreso than anything else. Why would they institute an overly complicated mess of auto targeting with weaponry instead of having your normal point and fire crosshairs? Why why why?!? Yes this game has a few 'immersive' moments, and yes it COULD have been something great, but quite frankly i couldnt get beyond the rank stupidity of the way shooting is done, and the frustration caused when you die because your character seems to be oh so much more interested in looking at an extra clip of ammo than the fact that he is getting shot."
1,Banging my head against the wall is as much fun,"This game is too long. Just when you think that you've beat it, another 10 to 20 hrs of play is added. Fighting umpteen monsters in first person is rather tiresome and when you are able to defeat them all, you know that it is luck. I must say this is about the worst game i've ever played"
1,Gonna hate it,Dis game is uuuuuuurting. fin you go play and its over like dat. No funnies and no hottie gurls. would rather spent my money on other stuff.
4,A pleasant surprise,"A brisk and dark 3D action game: part shooter, part beat-em-up and all pretty enjoyable. Things to like: The T'lan enemies are downright intimidating early in the game (less so later on as your powers expand). It's big (it took me 20 hours just to get through it -- not counting all the replays) and not over when you think it is. And it's a solid story; I always understood what was going on -- in no small part because clipboards and voiceovers fill in details throughout. My one complaint is that the game's too linear -- just one path -- and, apart from the boss battles at the very end, pretty easy for a game with a checkpoint system.(If you fail in a sequence, it reloads with a healthier character.) But, that said, I bought into Breakdown's world and premise quickly an they stuck with me until the end."
1,Stereo! (for half),"So the big deal is that this archival footage from 1980. The ""Ad Lib"" jazz show. They say on the package that this was the ""first musical television show recorded in Stereo"". Well, that is half true. This DVD is comprised of two shows from the Ad Lib series - Show #40 and Show #41. Only #40 is in stereo. #41 is a (bad) mono mix. So while the band is swingin', and the tunes are good, and Freddie is Freddie, the sound just ain't that good on the stereo version and plain stinks on the mono one. So, unless you are die hard gotta have it Freddie fan, I'd say pass on this disc. A very cursory ""interview"" is also included where Freddie introduces his band. Bonus features are a terribly produced ""bio"" of Freddie which is comprised of VERY slow liner notes rising up the screen a la credits, and advertisements for other discs in the series. How much did I pay for this?!? I think it's going back to Amazon...."
4,freddie hubbard one of a kind,"-video quality: average-sound quality: average-personnel: freddie hubbard (t), billy childs (p), stephen houghton (d), buck clark (percussion), larry klein (b)-uk 40 is bird like, a blues freddie wrote when he first went to nyc (the name is quite puzzling);-uk 41 is unknown but is familiar; perhaps there were copyright problem- group is not like the bird like with ron carter, mccoy tyner, elvin jones: one of freddie's greatest solosit interesting to note how freddie has the unorthodox dizzy cheeks (puffed out) that he didn't have when younger-this music is always better in person, but recordings are the only source left"
2,a preasent for my brother =),"i got i-ninja when it first came out. for the GCN caus i thaught it looked allright after playing the demos. i regret buying it now, the storyline doesnt really work. the music was good but the graphics sub/par, there were uber moves........ but they havnt got the essense of ninjai at all. i played about 10 levels and now im over it. im probibly gonna sell it or give it to my little brother for a belated christmas preasent,=) haha."
5,Sounds fun,"With all these reviews I've decided to buy this game. I have played a little bit of the tutorial and it left my jaw in the ground. The graphics are great. What I like is that you can explore a whole level. You don't just go to parts of the level you have to go like sonic adventure 2 battle. You can do much more things than in other games like in spiderman 2. I hope it is as great as they say because I thought animal crossing was going to be great but was annoying after a while. The screenshots of this game seem like they are works of art with all that action. This game reminds me of spiderman 2, glover, and mario. if like good butt kicking games you'll like this one because it has both action and adventure. And if you're in a bad mood you can just laugh at the size of the ninja. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. You can earn belts and sword upgrades to kick some butt."
1,No skill needed.,"If you want to waste some money and bore yourself stupid, get I-Ninja. I thought it would be a great challenge with meaningful insights. Instead I found the humor terse and the skill level, well there was none. There is much better out there."
4,What are you people smoking?,"Or shall I say what aren't you smoking? ""I NINJA"" is a great game. It's like taking the most popular games out there, putting them in a blender, and turning them into one SUPER game. Games like ""Mystical Ninja"", ""Super Monkey Ball"", ""Mario 64"" (for instance) all come to mind while playing this. And I'm not saying this game is better than the titles I mentioned above but anyone who gave this game anything lower than 3 stars must not like 3D platform games period. My jaw dropped to the floor when I saw all the 1 star reviews, I thought it was some kinda evil conspiracy. I felt I had to tell the truth. ""I NINJA"" is a worthy game for a worthy gamer(s). I recommend not getting on the (~I Ninja~ sucks) bus, because it's one of those short ones with a ramp. An easy 4 star title."
4,A solid game,"I Ninja is a well made game. Gamers between the ages of 13-25 would find this game enjoyable and entertaining.Pros:Great combination of several game stylesUnique fighting system centered around swords and ninja weaponsIt is challenging, but not impossibleExcellent humor that is cleanCons:Replaying of levels gets tedious. However, it must be done to complete the game.Completing certain objectives can be time consuming.I highly recommend this game to anyone who is interested in it. It is worth your time and money."
4,Ninja don't kill me,"I-Ninja is a game from my childhood and I have to say that the experience is still pretty good. The ninja's comments about the ongoing action is funny, and the gameplay is good; however, the the last area seems to become slightly stale. A good game, I recommend it to platformer lovers and those who love senseless beatings."
3,Getting Smart About Love,"Francell and Winter havecrystalized the wisdom andexperiences from their Heart Seminars. They lucidly describe how present-day overreactions are effects of feelings repressed in childhood.A new insight reveals thatthese old emotions are triggered not only becauseof stress, but especially because of the safe environment provided by the intimate relationship itself, by the security of being in love.The authors present anddescribe numerous techniques for couples to help and support each other, when personal, individual ""stuff"" is released by thesituations of their lives.Although written with anemphasis on men in committed relationships, the exercises work for women also.The book provides coupleswith tools to heal pastemotional wounds and thusdeepen their attachment toeach other. They learn newrelationship skills thatfew of us learned from ourfamilies or from earlysocial interactions."
4,"Darwin, the person","This book is a great introduction to Charles Darwin, the human being.So often we think of Darwin as a thinker, a philosopher, a scientist, a villain, a hero, and associate him only with the theory of evolution that we don't think at all about him as a real person. We never bother comtemplating who Darwin was or where he was coing from.This book explores the life, lifestyle and personality of Charles Darwin and looks at the forces that shaped him and his writings. His love for his children, his grief over the loss of his beloved daughter from a painful chronic disease, his struggle with the idea of faith in God, his doubts about the meaning of life, all come together to introduce us to Darwin like no other books before has done.Anyone at all interested in Charles Darwin, his writings or evolution must read this book. The reader will stop thinking of him as a caricature and start seeing him as a human man.Superbly done!"
4,A unexpected surprise,"I read this book, because I was going to meet its author and I was prepared for a very boring book, which is certainly not the case. Keynes is a very good author and he did a lot of recherche to write it. It is amazing, at least it was to me, to discover that everyone, even the children, wrote diaries and letters, almost every day and Keynes has made a very charmig selection to demostrate how his great grandfather could escape religion and become able to elaborate the Theory of Evolution."
5,Achieving acquaintance with the Darwin family,"Having long admired the ability of Charles and Emma Darwin to maintain their loving marriage in the face of the enormous difference between his commitment to a naturalistic worldview and hers to a more traditional theological perspective, I have wished for a book that would focus more upon Emma and their offspring than was done by any of the Darwin biographies I've read. At last there is such a book -- by a great-great-grandson of Charles Darwin, Randal Keynes, who drew heavily from Darwin family papers. Its title is: DARWIN, HIS DAUGHTER, AND HUMAN EVOLUTION (New York: Riverhead Books, 2002). It is written so well that reading it gave me a keen sense of near-personal acquaintance with the Darwins, as well as deepened insights into the thinking processes that characterised the great scientist."
3,too baggy,The 505 husky jeans are a nice color. The husky size is too roomy in the legs and bottom for my 11 year old who is stocky but not large in the legs. The pants sort of hang with a lot of fabric-would be great if you are going for the baggy look though.
4,Nice Jeans,"Nice jeans however, hey run very large ordered a 12 husky for grandson and need to returnand order size 10. This will be the third time ...... So if you do order they run VERY LARGE otherwiseThey are nice jeans so I will try one more time .... Ha ha ..."
3,sizes run large,The sizes run larger than the actual measurements so knock an inch off the childs measurenments when ordering. good quality levis. Great price.
3,"If you like weaklings, this is the book for you","First of all I would like to say that it was an interesting, and occasionally very funny book on the ten most inept chief executives we've ever had. But that doesn't excuse the fact that 9 out of the 10 are for the most part hapless losers, which makes for slow reading. Most fall within easily seen categories: those who had really corrupt presidencies because of their con-men ""friends"", those who were brought into the white house by big-business interests and not expected to do anything, those who never took on controversial issues & so were liked by everybody(at least at first, their indecision invariably didn't get them re-elected), and finally in a category all his own, Richard Nixon. I've always enjoyed reading the ""worst of"" lists, but these guys are almost as bland and uninteresting to read as when they were alive. Go rent it from the library, or get it at a used bookstore."
2,Shallow Work,"Considering the depth of Miller's larger works of individual biographies, this book disappoints. Miller skims lightly over each of these ""worst"" presidential lives, presenting only the facts and opinions which support his premise. Better, more thoughtful analysis is available from many sources. In particular, readers might try Robert Gilbert's ""The Mortal Presidency"" (Harper Collins, 1992) for more human treatment of Calvin Coolidge's deep depression, and Maxim Armbruster's ""The Presidents of the United States"" (Horizon, 1960) -- arguably the best collection of essays written on the presidents -- for a more objective view of Andrew Johnson's character qualities."
1,This guy doesn't know his arse from a hole in the ground,"Who is this Nathan Miller to bedevil the reputations of past leaders because they were fat,like he does with Taft,or unsocial,like Ben Harrison,or because they were products of thier time,like Kennedy,jackson,or even a saint like Jimmy Carter?I would think that LEADERSHIP,or the lack thereof,would be the single criteria by which to judge a president,but apparently a doofus like Miller is more interested in making fun of personality traits than in giving any real thought to the achievements,or mistakes of our presidents...Don't buy this book under any circumstance,unless you are one of those worms who enjoy making fun of people based on size,or personality quirk,rather than seeking any understanding as to why these men were either great or mediocore..."
3,So So,"Mr. Miller's rendition of the 10 worst presidents is a good overview. It's a collection of brief generalizations with a few anecdotes for each, ranking the top ten (or bottom ten, depending on your point of view) from bad to terrible. The author does make you think; James Buchanan was never seen without his Senator bachelor roommate. Warren Harding's wife refused permission for an autopsy, lending speculation that she poisoned him.I'd like to think that I'd come to the same conclusions if I read a biography on each president he talks about. Overall, though, if you've an opportunity to add this to your Presidential Biographical collection, I recommend to do so."
5,"AWESOME FOR CRAFTS, TOOLS AND EVERYTHING ELSE YOU CAN THINK OF!",RECIEVED MY ITEM QUICKLY! I AM HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE IT IS EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED AND WILL BE BACK AGAIN FOR MORE ITEMS! HELPS KEEP MY EMBELLISHMENT TOOL BOX ORGANIZED. LOVE THEM!
5,Stack-On Plastic Storage Drawer Deviders,"These are really easy to install, and fir the draws perfectly. I boought these, and would certainly buy them again. Very reasonably priced."
3,Serves a purpose,Had to buy these extra dividers becuase the storage cabinet I bought didn't have near enogh of them. I don't like to have to buy add-ons that are extra.
4,Necessary,"Why they don't package these with the cabinet itself, I have no idea. Works pretty well, sometimes small parts roll under them, they do not snap into place in my particular parts drawers."
2,"Unique, but incredibly annoying","I admit, this game is a lot of fun... AT FIRST. The games style is uniquely fresh and i admire the attempt, however its time to get down to brass tacks. Frankly,the enemies are a mere annoyance in this game and pose no real threat at all. Its simply a matter of choosing the right form. And while u dont have to change to beat specific enemies, the game will never forgive you for it. A certain enemy has a shield, making it resistant to guns, and if u so much as think about shooting it the game will sound ""Gun doesnt seem to work"" ""I dont think i should use gun"" ""thats not a good idea"" I wouldnt mind if they only told you once, but no! Every 3 seconds they have to shout this. If u like playing games while listening to something other than the game its a rental for sure."
3,"""Weak design""","I think this toy is a great idea to help entertain your child in their high chair while preparing food, cleaning up etc. The problem we had and why I didn't give it very good ratings is that our twins were able to pull it off the tray surface from day one. The suction on this toy is not very strong and because it is very rarely in the position it was designed to be in it was hard to rate it as fun and educational."
1,Don't bother!!,"I bought this toy for an addition to my son's exerciser. However, it would not stick (to anything)!! I tried everything to make it stick. It was very frustrating."
5,Even fun for an adult,"My niece loved it so much that her mother bought one for me. It attaches to my desk (though it falls off frequently) and is a great conversation piece and stress reliever. I have to push the mute button during conference calls, so that the others on the call can't hear me playing with it."
4,Safety Issue,My six month old daughter got her finger stuck in the toy (betweem the blue and yellow spinner and the main frame)while playing with it. I informed the company via email and they called me at 6:00 AM. The send my daughter a teething toy as compensation. Also the suction cup does not stick well
1,Not much fun,"I bought this toy for my daughter at about 7 months old. She has always been able to easily remove the suction cup from her high chair tray, then the toy quickly gets thrown to the ground. She never really got into spinning the various objects. Despite all the good reviews I have read, this toy really didn't keep my daughter's attention."
2,It really doesn't stick. Really.,"This toy is so close to greatness ... but a miss is as good as a mile. The suction cup doesn't stick to anything, and the toy is therefore minimally useful as just another thing for the kid to suck on. I've had this toy through three kids, and every one of 'em could yank it off whatever surface I stuck it to within six seconds."
2,The sucker does not work at all,"I bought this toy for my daughter, who is now 6 1/2 months old. She seems interested in it, but everytime I stick it to any surface she plucks it right off and ends up throwing it on the ground. I think she would really enjoy this toy if it would actually stay stuck to a surface. I don't recommend this unless they can improve the suction."
1,Save your money !,"This toy actually won an award?The sucker doesnt stick to anything.My baby is more interested in the rubber sucker. Everytime I pass the toy to her, she will turn it around and chew on the green rubber sucker.Do Amazon or Sassy sell the rubber sucker separately?"
5,My four month old loves this toy!,"I have a four month old son who absolutely loves this toy and has for over a month now. This was the first toy that he would play with in his car seat and now we go nowhere without it. At this point we just play with it as a rattle, but with the suction cup attachment I'm sure we will be playing with it for many more months."
5,Favorite Toy,"The Facination Station is my 5-month-old daughter's favorite toy. For the first two months, we hung it above her changing table. She could not reach the toy, but liked watching us twirl it. For her third month, we were in transit to Hawaii. We hung it to the underside of a glass coffee table in our hotel room, where it became an activity center for her to bat. This last month, we detatched it from the base. She plays with it in her swing. Her eyes just light up when we hand this toy to her."
5,First Impression don't always last...,"I was originally dissappointed with this toy because I bought if to stick on my daughter's high chair. The suction cup did not hold under any speakable weight. Even when I lifted the tray, it would come lose and fall to the floor. When it did not fit my purpose I put it in my daughter's, Aislynn's <nine 1/2 months> toy box. It took her no time at all to find it and since then that is one of the first toys she goes for. She simply adores it as does the other children that come to play. So regardless of my initial reaction, I have no regrets now and reccomend it's purchase to all my friends with children.Sincerly, Sabrina"
5,Fascination Station is very fascinating.,"Really nice toy, has different colors, different shapes and sounds that can be spin separately or all together at the same time. Suction cup does not work very well though.However I would still highly recommend this toy."
3,A little disappointing,"Although my daughter likes the toy, the suction cup base doesn't stick to any surface I have tried so it won't stand up on it's own and therefore you don't get to play with the spinner as you should. Little hands also get stuck when spinning it around so it doesn't get going very well."
4,5 minutes of fascination,This product captures the attention of our 9 week old for 5 minutes. It sticks well to smooth surfaces and holds onto the surface until I use the release to pull it off the surface. I was surprised to read that it doesn't stick well for others (it helps to gently wet the bottom). We received our toy as a gift and so far has worked well.
5,Must have!,"This adorable toy is so versatile. It's great to be able to stick it on the high chair, in the bath tub...or take it off of the suction and let baby go for it. My son liked it so much that I bought one for my niece!"
3,It didn't take long to figure out!,"I bought this to use on the high chair, but within 2 days my son had the rattle part off the base. Needless to say it never went back on for more than 5 min. BUT he did enjoy it in the car and other places."
4,Won't stick to anything!,"I purchased this to put on my daughter's exersaucer and found quickly that it just won't stick. She's only 4 months old, yet can pull it off and drop it on the floor within seconds. Very frustrating. I had a hard time fimding a suction-cup base toy and thought this would be great. My daughter loves playing with it and trying to chew on it - but it quicly ends up onthe floor. Had I known this I wouldn't have purchased it - any of her other toys would work the same."
2,Not a Good Deal!,"The perfumes are ok but the quantity is very small. The product information does not contain the quantity details. Except for one, the rest are just 4-5 ml bottles. Certainly not a good deal."
1,never received the game,We're still waiting for our order to come in the mail. It was a birthday gift for my 12-year-old son. That was a month ago. The game has not arrived.
3,Not Very Satisfying,"The semi-third person view is not very satisfying. It would have been nice for them to detach the rear bumper-perspective and allow the true third-person detached perspective, like Burnout and Burnout 2 and most racing games. Other than that, the game has nice graphics and the racing cars are awesome. If you want to have some racing fun, then get this game. But if you want a truly satisfying all encompassing racing experience, then buy Burnout 2."
4,A huge dissapointment...,"How hard is it to make a decent driving game these days...? After getting addicted to Need For Speed: Underground I decided to give Racing Evolution a try. This game is a total waste of money. The best part of the game is the story mode...but unlike NFS it does not last long enough. The graphics are good, but I would rather have more speed than bigger cars...(cars are too big!). Total waste of money..."
3,"The hand-vac works well, but..","Like the title states, the hand-vac works nicely, but the sweeper doesn't work as well on the carpet as it does the floors. On the carpet, it takes a few passes before most everything is picked up. There are always a few little bits that need to be picked up by hand. Overall, it's easier than lugging out the vacuum, but it may not save any time due to the amount of passes to clean on area. A definite plus is the fact that it's cordless. Cordless is always nice."
2,Erik Goes Metal,"I had high expectations for this one, based on Norlander's superb previous solo effort, Threshold. Unfortunately, Erik is into this metal thing lately. This change from a classic, lush symphonic sound to a heavy prog-metal sound doesn't really suit him, in my opinion. He's still a brilliant keyboardist, but all of the loud, crunching guitars and heavy metal vocals (from various guest vocalists)overpower much of his keyboard work on this album. There are some nice moments (mainly the non-vocal tracks), but not enough to raise this to the level of Threshold or his work with Rocket Scientists. In fairness, this album will probably appeal greatly to heavy metal fans. As for traditional symphonic prog lovers...you've been warned: this is not what you'd probably expect from such a talented prog keyboardist as Erik Norlander."
3,Driven keyboard oriented rock,"This solo album by the keyboard player of Lana Lane and some Ayreon albums is not surprisingly dominated by keyboard oriented material. It is driven and fast paced progressive rock that in some ways is comparable to Trevor Rabin (of Yes fame) material. Catchy choruses like in 'Rome is Burning' will subconsciously be creeping up on you in the shower, for the neighbourhood to be shared. Arjen Anthony Lucassen is the man behind the guitars on this album and the concept of most Ayreon albums, so you can expect his influence to be felt on Erik's project. Several singers (male and female) compliment the instruments to make for an enjoyable rock experience."
5,Quality product,"I was a little hesitant to buy this product, given the low price and lack of reviews, but after crawling all over the internet looking up product descriptions for various bags, I decided to go for it, and I have to say that I am very pleased that I did. The bag seems small, but it still manages to fit two balls comfortably enough, and it has a padded flap that you can use between the balls and your shoes, or underneath them, and this allows you to use the divider flap that goes between the balls, to prevent them knocking together.The shoe compartment was small, I first thought, but I'm not really sure what I was expecting. It holds my shoes fine, and even though they get a little bit smooshed in travel, it sure isn't anything out of the ordinary.The carrying straps are heavy duty, all the zippers feel secure and robust, the clips and such are thick, and the shoulder strap is comfy and well-padded. This bag does everything I need and does it well."
5,Great Story and Very Educational,I love this story of the eskimos. They are such happy people and it makes me stop and enjoy the small things in life. I buy this book whenever I see it and give it away so everyone can enjoy it.
2,Such low quality for a high price..........,"First off this is not a case, it is a pouch with a clear plastic front and draw strings at the top. Once in the case the controls are not that responsive because they are touchpads. Also it is such a tight fit that it is hard to get the player in and out of it and I feared scratching the display. The fit is so tight that after about a week the stiching holding the clear plastic in place began to come apart and in about another week there was a noticeable hole between the stiching and the clear plastic. Very low quality for the price.I love my Creative Zen Micro Photo, but hate the fact that accessories are so limited for it."
4,Fact about doll,This is an awesome doll!Did you know that on the Barbie website that a 9 year old girl won the barbie fashion fever contest and that this is the outfit that she designed?I think that that girl should get some credit too
1,Could be better.,"The story is pretty interesting, but I'm guessing this is the author's first novel. Throughout the book, the voice sounded either weak, borrowed or forced. Readable, but barely."
1,Dull first effort,"Growing up in Alberta, I was quite excited when I was told of this book by a friend. After reading Choke Hold, I was disappointed. The story is not very reflective of life on the prairies and I think this came from the authors attempt to mimic other writers (Bret Easton Ellis) instead of finding his own voice. Being a native Albertan, I'll pick up Babiak's second effort when it is released (gotta support local writers) but hopefully the style will be more original."
5,cool book,"The voice of Jeremy, the hero of Choke Hold, is subdued and funny and sad. I heard this book was going to be made into a movie, and it will make a good movie. I just don't know how it will convey all the inner thoughts of Jeremy - my favourite parts."
1,Ameteurish,"Having lived in Alberta many years ago, I'm always looking for some great prairie writing, but I have to agree with the review below. Choke Hold sounded interesting from the descriptions I've read, but the novel rings hollow and without heart. The book comes across as more of an exercise from a creative writing class as opposed to a solid novel. With a wealth of other canuck writers, perhaps I'll look elsewhere for a slice of Canadian life."
5,The Christmas Shoes,"My daughter & I have always watched ""The Christmas Shoes"" together on the Hallmark Channel & for some reason it was not shown this year, therefore the reason I bought the DVD Triple Feature. Did not realize that the""The Christmas Blessing"" was a sequel, so we were both delighted & over joyed!!! Love it!!"
1,Well Received,The gift arrived in a timely Manor and well received as the gift that was given for my family member.
5,Christmas Shoes,We just LOVE this movie! But when it wasn't going to be shown on air this year I just had to buy it. It came rather quickly and it excellent shape.
5,quality product,A great idea to have all these movies together! A quality product at a great price! Super fast shipping. Great service!
1,Missing Christmas Blessing,"I am usually very satisfied with my purchases through Amazon, but NOT with this one. I didn't open this until yesterday, and will never wait that long to open again. This was missing one of the DVDs - Christmas Blessing. I bought it for a gift, but forgot about it, found it yesterday and opened it and it was missing Christmas Blessing. It's not worth it to me to pay to ship it back and only get a partial refund. It might cost me more than I would get in return, and certainly not enough to replace the item."
5,Great Movie,Loved this movie. I just watched all three movies the other night and I cried at the end of each one.I would recommend this seller to anyone. Positive experience!
3,Holiday Triple Feature: Christmas Shoes/Christmas Blessing/Christmas Hope,The movies them selves were great but I was truely dissapointed in this day and age that there was no closed caption or subtitles. My husband can't hear and we like to watch movies together. For that reason and that reason alone I will not be able to order movies on line.
4,Christmas movies,"Enjoyed all three Christmas movies, but Christmas shoes was alittle hard to watch (sad). Arrived in a timely manner in good shape. Would recommend"
5,great,Great rating i would recomend this product to anyone. And I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
4,Helped me a great deal,I found that using this workbook along with my therapist to be the safest way to do it. It brings up a great deal of emotional baggage... and doing it alone can be scary. It will trigger you.But the outline is great.. from one step to another.I highly recommend this workbook.Understanding Self-Injury: A Workbook for Adults
5,If I could give this movie more than 5 stars I would!!,"This is the best ""feel good"" movie I have seen. I watch this movie when I am happy, sad, or just want to watch a good flick. Sandra Bullock plays the part of a person with no family so well that you just want to hug her and invite her into your own. The entire cast does a great job with this movie, ""Grandma Elsie"" cracks me up with her ""Episodes"" I had not seen Glynnis Johns do such a good job since she played the mother of Jane and Michael Banks in ""Mary Poppins"". The scenes of ""Lucy"" and her boss are also a highlight.This movie is not just a holiday movie, I'd recommend it anytime."
5,"A cute, original masterpiece!","This irresistable comedy is the ultimate you can find in a movie. Sandra Bullock delivers a ground breaking performance as a woman who saves a man, and later finds out the family thinks she's engaged to him - and then falls for his cute brother! (Bill Pullman) The acting is second to none, the storyline can't be beat, and the plot is a charming change from the usual run of the mill ""chick flicks"". This movie is all you could ever want."
2,"Moviemaking in a coma, I know, I know, it's serious...","While I was sleeping, another brilliant movie was made that had local pundits from KWHO-TV in Fargo calling it ""The Feel-Good Movie of the Year! "" and WHOR-FM in Jacksonville saying ""The Best Date Movie of the Decade! "" Cornfed slackjawed drones reminiscent of Jean of The Onion's ""A Room of Jean's Own"" drooled into their over buttered troughs of popcorn while they tried desperately to live vicariously by squeezing their cellulite thighs into a celluloid Sandra Bullock's size 7 Guess? jeans. For the easily duped and constantly outsmarted, this movie will provide endless entertainment. Both candy-coated stars are for you, but don't eat them. Think I'll hit the snooze bar."
2,Not family oriented movie,"I read many of the positive reviews for this movie. Although the storyline is entertaining, I found the movie plagued with sexual induendos, some coarse language, and using God's name without due respect. If you are looking for a decent movie, this one will disappoint."
1,Awful Service,"I still have not recieved my product, one calendar month after ordering it. My attempts to contact this seller went unanswered. Worst experience I have ever had on amazon."
3,The Greatest Romantic Movie In A World,I have not words for this movie. I think that movie While You Were Sleeping is SUPER movie. I must say that I love this film.
4,"Engaging story, without being sappy!","I don't know if most men shy away from romantic comedies or not. But my husband likes both Bill Pullman and Sandra Bullock so he'll watch this with me from time to time. One of my favorites of the genre. And certainly worth a few laughs.Gail StrumbergerAuthor, ""Shock Therapy: Planaphobic"""
3,Three Facts,"Chick Flicks fall into three categories for me: 1.Too much fun to care if it's a C.F. (think Four Weddings and a Funeral). 2. Not entirely painful, with a few cute moments ( like While You Were Sleeping). 3. Please, just shoot me! Now I'll give you three facts to help you decide if you want to invest an hour and a half of your life.1. This movie is rated PG.2.This movie is scored with ""sappy elevator elevator music""- no discernable instruments involved.3. Siskel and Ebert, who gave this movie ""two thumbs up"", are from Chicago where the movie was filmed."
4,While You Were Sleeping,This is a cute girl movie but I think guys could like it too. It's kind of sappy and funny but enjoyable. There's no foul language or people killing each other or jumping in and out of bed which seems to make up most movies these days. I've seen the movie several times and still enjoy watching it.
4,Classic Sandra Bullock,"Love this movie! It's one of the films I watch when I'm feeling down; I always know what I'm getting. Even though it's a bit creepy that Sandra Bullock is basically obsessed and stalking this man, I love this movie."
1,Disapointed,"I chose this rating for several different reasons. I received the product and it has been used, severely. The disk is scratched and I feel that if I'm paying for something, it should be in good condition. I was getting this for a gift, and there is no way I can confidently gift this! Generally I don't have any issues, unfortunately this time let me down."
5,Bill Pullman is a very talented actor!,"Probably the Best movie ever made. It is funny, brilliant, comic ... and the actors are wonderful. I love the chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Bill Pullman. He is absolutely the greatest actor in the world. He is really nice and cute. Beautiful movie, if you haven't seen it yet, go and buy it!!"
5,This movie is Da Bomb!,"Hey Y'all! What's up? This movie is the best! And what also makes it good is that Sandra Bullock is in it! Oh yeah has anyone seen Forces of Nature? Anyway, when i rented it I thought that it was the best movie! So i wanted to bye it! And guess what I did! I think that you guys should watch this movie if you haven't cuz it's COOL!! It's really funny and you'd NEVER get bored of it! The best part in the movie that I liked is the part where Joe Jr. was trying on her shoes, that CRACKED me up! Anough talking so I'll See You all later BYE-BYE!!!"
5,while you were sleeping,By buying this I have updated my own self recorded copy of this Sandra Bullock touching comedy. Shipping was very quick. Product is in excellent condition.
4,Great mosie,I love this movie i already have it but you should all buy it its not all mussshhhyyy but a really great story.Sandra is so lovable! and Bill!when i first saw this movie it stuck!whenever i saw it on tv i had to leave it and watch!i bought it a yr ago and watch it whenever i want to watch a great movie!!
4,A very romantic comedy,"I think this hit romantic comedy woke everyone up to adorable Sandra Bullock, as Lucy a lonely subway worker that by saving a handsome stranger (Peter Gallagher) she was already secretly in love with him and became part of his family. When she falls for his brother (Bill Pullman) everything gets interesting. You'll have to see this dvd, the situation really gets uproaring-funny.In the end, she is forced to make a choice between the two. Well thank God it ended happyly ever after. A true love story, great job Sandy."
5,classic,this movie has the potential of becoming a classic. such a romantic story...i watch it even when it's not christmas time...it's good to warm the heart.
3,One of my favorite movies,Its a great movie and i am glad to now have it with me when ever am in the mood to watch it.
3,"For a romantic comedy, it was good","I don't know why Sandra Bullock insists upon playing the same character in every film. However, since this is an older one where she was sort of starting out in this genre, I have to say, that I actually liked this movie. It seems sincere, and sweet and funny. Sandra really does fit into her role so well. Its certainly not great, but for a chick flick, its not a bad watch."
4,Lucy and jack. 16th april 2004.,"Lucy[sandra bullock], see A man peter[peter gallagher] again even though i don't think she even knows him, she fancies him. He is pushed onto a train track, she saves him by moving him away before he gets killed. Peter is in a comber, and all his relatives think that she is his fiancee. Peters brother jack meets her and while he is still in hospital, they both fall in love, but when peter is finally out of hospital, he wants her too. WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING, EVERYTHING WENT ON WHEN HE WAS IN THAT HOSPITAL BED."
5,Fast and Accurate,My order was received faster than anticipated and the DVD was still in its original package. Great service!
4,"Funny enough for a man, but made for a woman","This film is definitely a so-called ""chick flick"", and I purchased it for my wife because she wanted it for Christmas. That being said, if it weren't for her I never would have enjoyed this film. I thought it was funny, and had all the elements that make a film work: solid plot with a twist, rich characters that you could relate to or remind you of someone you know. I especially liked 'Joe Jr.' who is pathetically funny... you'll have to watch it to know what I'm talking about. I would recommend it for anyone who likes romantic comedies, and the guys that don't mind them."
5,If you have any romance in your soul.....,"This is a classic romantic comedy. I'm old enough to have enjoyed the romantic comedies of 40 years ago when they seemed fresh and new. While You Were Sleeping can hold its own with any of the classics of the past. It not only takes great writing to make a great romantic comedy, it takes great casting. Fortunately, the stars of While You Were Sleeping fit their roles perfectly. I don't know how Bill Pullman affects the ladies, but I fell in love with Sandra Bullock within the first five minutes of the movie. Like most of the other reviewers, I have watched the movie many times and enjoyed it each time. If you have any romance in your soul, you will love this movie, too."
1,1 star because Sandy's in it,This movie is a pile of crap. Sandra Bullock either you love her or hate her. I love her and even I have trouble sitting through this. Crappy romantic comedy (is there any other kind of romantic comedy?) This isnt even funny. Just crap. Im sorry.
3,Snow in Florence,"Really liked the movie. The supporting cast was wonderful. This DVD lackedbackground information that I love to see such as casting and productioninformation. Not critically acclaimed, but I enjoy seeing it over and overas the message is timeless."
5,Antidote to the Chicago winter chill.,"Even though I am not from Chicago, I cannot imagine a worse time to shoot a movie there. Seeing this one, however, has me thinking about what finding someone you love can do even in the worst of times and places. The romance between Sandra Bullock---in her finest role---and Bill Pullman---one of his finest roles---could warm the bleakest, coldest, and most unforgiving Midwest winter and thaw the thickest Lake Michigan ice cap. And you realize you don't really need steamy sex scenes to ward off the Wisconsinian glacial advance. Just that magical ""click"" can do the job (the music and the goofy cast helped, too!)."
5,one of my favorite holiday movie.,"christmas is about families, what if you don't have any, great movie to watch on a cold snowy day with you girlfriends or a date. Makes you laugh, makes you cry, one of the best kinds of movies."
1,Worthless for me.,The disc is mastered for region 2. It will not work in players intended for North America. A complete was of money.
5,Sleeper Romantic Comedy,All along she notices the handsome man at the subway but was too scared to talk to him. Until his accident and a series of misunderstandings have his family believe that she is his fiancee. But the real love turns out to be the brother of her crush .... and when the feeing is mutual ... and her crush awakes from his coma .... she has two choices to contend with. Funny! Moral of the story - don't say I Do no matter how good he looks if you don't love him 100%.
4,ATTN DVD OWNERS....IN DD 2.0....BASICALLY STEREO,"This happens to be one of my wife's favorite movies, so when we got our dvd player I ordered on dvd. I was disappointed, however, when I played it that it only plays in digital stereo---not Dolby Digital, or even Dolby surround. Great movie.....really like it every time I watch it."
5,Wonderfully touching tale!,I absolutely love this movie! I could watch it again and again and never get sick of it. It's a touching comedy with a hilarious twist.
5,A sweet romantic comedy,"I really like ""While You Were Sleeping."" Bill Pullman and Sandra Bullock were wonderful and the story endearing and sweet, although very unlikely to occur in real life. If you like a sweet romantic comedy in which you can relate to the heroine, I recommend this movie."
5,forgotten,"the best movie ever, enough said, if you are a romantic this is the movie for you, sandra bullock is superb."
5,"Classic Comedy, Love Story and overall Family Fun.","This movie shows that you are NOT crazy & you are not alone. Everyone has felt as if they don't fit in and ""is it always going to be like this?"" This film has several Titles. CLassic Family Fun & Comedy for anytime."
3,Somewhat boring and pointless,"While the story itself seems like it ought to be fairly interesting, this telling of it is simply quite dull, and adds up to nothing. Not nearly as good as, say, Crichton's The Great Train Robbery."
1,Terrible!,"Excuse me, is it a version 6.5 book? It lacks important information about SQL server 7. The presentation of the whole book is terrible. How can Prentice Hall let this book out in the market??"
1,Warning! This book is not really about SQL Server 7!!!,This book is not primarily about version 7. It doesn't discuss issues that have been brought up by the new version of SQL Server. The illustrations are clearly from an older edition than Beta 3 (most are probably from v6.5) and running on an older edition of NT (<v4.0). Avoid this book if seeking accurate information about v7.0!
1,SUCK,"I love bad horror films, but my god, this sucked.Do not waste your time.My boyfriend nearly killed himself watching this. (no, literally)If you like a whiny little girl screaming for a hour and half then watch it until your heart is content."
2,"Not the same as ""Penny Dreadful"" with Betsy Palmer...","I thought this was just an OK movie... But what does it have to do with the ""Penny Dreadful"" novels?? It doesnt... and that's not the only thing that doesnt make sense in the film... BTW this is NOT the film directed by Bryan Norton and starring Betsy Palmer.. thats a different ""Penny Dreadful"" that actually won alot of film festivals...Penny Dreadful"
3,Pretty Good! ***1/2,"I've only seen three of these After Dark Horror Fest films but I'll have to say that so far ""Penny Dreadful"" is definitely the more satisfying of the bunch. ""Unrest"" was a flop and ""Gravedancers"" was 5 minutes away from being a masterpiece and then they screwed it up with the CGI ending, but this one started, progressed and ended on a good healthy balanced note. It has some dry moments and like most decent horror films a couple of illogical happenings but other than that it's a solid creepy little film with some very good acting worthy of any horror fans collection."
1,The Worst of the Fest...,"The only reason to get this film is if you buy the box set of the entire festival that they are releasing the same day. This was, by far, the worst of the bunch, and this is coming from someone who has a low standard for horror film enjoyment."
1,absolutely dreadful,"I went into this movie with high hopes. I too have a bit of a car phobia (though nothing like this girl, Penny) so I thought hey that's an interesting premise...and it would have been if the main charachter Penny had been the least bit likable. She cried, moaned, cringed and did basically nothing...the few things she did do were so feeble/feeble minded that I kept hoping she would find herself severed in half or something. The movie reminded me a bit of the movie with tom hanks stranded on a deserted island, with only wilson as her friend. Mimi Rogers plays, for the majority of the movie, a corpse. Great use of talent there. I have watched 4 of the horrorfest movies so far and this is the only one that truly disappointed me. I really wanted to like it, but it was basically unredeemable. The whole premise is ludicrous...absolute crap."
1,"Well,the title fits...","I've seen 6 of the 8 films to die for, and this was the worst I've seen. It had a chance to be such a good movie, but from the moment the therapist leaves the car, the movie goes downhill fast. Yes, I understood Penny's phobia, but she just carried on and on iin the car for what seemed like forever. Then the random characters they threw in, just to die quickly. And how weird was the killer? I still don't know if it was a man or woman, but I don't really care. This movie sucked, if you feel you have to see it to complete the set, try to watch it for free, and don't be afraid to use the fastforward button at points, I wish I would have."
5,horrorfest 2006,i did see this one at horrorfest last year. i thought that the movie was good. i really enjoyed it. can't wait for horrorfest 2007!
1,worst movie in a theater???? possibly.,"i saw this at horrorfest. i can't tell you how bad this was from start to finish. The entire film is a ""what not to do"" for horror. Every character explicitly exercised stupid judgment. then the director decides to center the majority of the movie on a really annoying lead character who does nothing but cry for 90 minutes on camera. every kill in this film came from sheer stupidity. most just waltzed in ready for death (oh yeah, really boring death at that). by 10 minutes into this film, you care about no one and prefer everyone die fast so you can move on with your life and forget this event.save your money kids, this one's worst than the dumbest b movie ever made.should you decide to watch this, do everyone a favor and review it to warn people like i tried to warn you about this ""Horror"" film."
2,What makes this movie so intense to be on this collection??,"According to the ""After Dark Horror Fest"" ads, these movies are SOO intense and disturbing for general audience! I mean... I saw all the horror movies from this collection and I understand why they are so intense for general audience. But this one is the only one that doesn't look so horrorful to be on this collection.I saw other movies in theares like Texas Chaisaw Massacre New Begining, Black Christmas 2007, Hills Have Eyes and Saw 3 and they are even WORST and HORRORFUL than this one. If someone knows the answer to my question please answer it.Adios."
3,Penny Dreadful,"Penny Dreadful is a cool concept, but would have been pulled off much better as part of an anthology. It was a great idea, something new, but it didn't deserve the full length movie treatment. An hour and a half was just too long and the movie felt really drawn out and forced. Thirty minutes could have been trimmed off of this and it would have been a much tighter thriller. Other than that is was great, but overly long run time and poor pacing reduced Penny Dreadful to an average horror film at best."
1,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"The After Dark Horrorfest (AKA 8 Films To Die For) are always really good or really bad. When it comes to Penny Dreadful, the title says it all. It's a boring film that was much too long, a ridiculous story, with horrible acting, and laughable text. A girl whose parents were killed in a car accident when she was a kid is now afraid of being in cars. To get over this fear she is going on a road trip, with her psychologist, where a creepy man they hit with the car comes after them. I know most horror films aren't written by Pulitzer Prize winners, but this is honestly the dumbest, most ridiculous story I've ever seen. Unless you want to waste 2 hours of your life, avoid this piece of garbage!"
1,Simply dreadful,"A 90 minute movie of which at least 60 minutes is spent watching Penny cry and dramatize and generally become so annoying that you WANT her to die. Nothing about this movie was original except the title credits.I was only able to get through it by using subtitles and watching the DVD at 2x speed. It might have worked as a 30 minute act in a trilogy, but 90 minutes of by-the-numbers slasher fare are intolerable in this day and age. Even the schlocky Friday the 13th movies were more entertaining than this cr@pfest.The only thing I can figure is that the 5 star reviews are all posted by people with financial stakes in this dog's breakfast of wasted celluloid."
1,Penny is dreadful,"Least the movie lives up to it's name. If you like the sound of a movie where a girl who is scared of cars gets stuck inside one for a whole movie while a Jason Voorhees wanna be killer is outside playing mind games with her and killing off everyone but the girl in the car, then this movie is for you.For the 99.9% of people who don't find that scary, this movie is slow, boring, drags on and on, and goes no where. It's stupid, far from scary, and a bore to watch an entire movie set inside of the front seats of a car wedged between 2 trees with nothing but annoying screaming and crying and a bogey man who needs to find a book like 'how to be a scary villain' ... man, Michael Jackson is scarier to think about then this thing."
5,Roy is the Man!,"Okay, so I do think this book needs to be revised for 2002, as it is a few years old and times have changed (mostly regarding funding and approaches), but as for a book of basic principles I was extremely impressed. Being a new-comer to the industry this book covers many aspects of operating a bar that a business owner should know, or at least pay attention to. This book was also very well written. If more people ran their bars utilizing some of the points in this book there would be better places to go and work... which is okay for me since no one in my town seems to know how to run a real bar/lounge..."
2,Not the best,"It felt and looked like I was playing a ps1 game from the late 90's. The Corvettes have a nice sound, the cars do not drive realisticly, they handle and feel heavy, the graphics are a little behind compared to there competitors. In comparison to Gran tursimo aspec, the corvette does not look photo realistic. The replays are very nauseating to watch and there is a limited number of tracks per car. I recommend renting the game. The game is not very good, its just good. Thats why the price was reduced. However the vital info on the vettes is good for learning and understanding what numbers the vette puts down in the 1/4 mile run and 0-60 times."
3,corvette ok but no that great,OK THE CORVETTE IS A GREAT CAR AND ANOTHER GREAT THING IS THAT THEY DEVOTED A GAME TO IT BUT IT COULD'VE BEEN BETTER THE GRAPHICS ARE OK BUT DOESN'T PUSH THE PS2 TO ITS STANDARDS THE ONLY REASON I BOUGHT IT IT WAS FOR THE $10.00 PRICE TAG BUT IRECCOMEND RENTING IT BEOFRE BUYING IT BEFORE EVEN SPENDING 10 DOLLARS PUT ANOTHER 10 DOLLARS AND BUY GRAN TRUSIMO 3
1,This Game STINKS!!!!,This Game Stinks I Bought It For 10 Bucks Just of The Price And It Was Not As Good As I Thought It Was Going To Be The Graphics Are Horrable and I Like Racing Games and This One Stinks!!!
3,Corvette,"Corvette For PS2:I like the Cars but the Game itself is not very good, neither are the graphics. If your A Corvette Enthusiast like me it's a must,but be forewarned it is not the best game sadly."
3,Excellent for the price,"This is a pretty good game. It has any kind of corvette you can think of except the C6 for next year, but oh well. It has som every interesting info on all the cars. And is very interesting to read through. The graphics aren't that great, but for the $15 that this game costs it is worth it. The handling is very unrealistic, but you'll get used to it. And once you do this game will be very easy. Almost too easy, but still somewhat challenging on the lardest difficulty."
2,Typical progressive ideology,"I bought this book as an investigation on how progressives re-write history, upon recommendation; but I did not realize that the author was a Marxist who in this work does the very thing that I was researching. A dense waste of pulp paper, look at the sample and then you'll know as much as you did before considering wasting precious hours that you'll never get back."
1,Horrible Gameplay and Graphics,"I just recently bought this game and put it in my PS2. WOW...what a disappointment. The graphics do not even compare with Tourist Trophy and the gameplay and controls are a horrible attempt at a simulation. You can not even turn around on a track during a race!!!The graphics make MotoGP4 look like it belongs on the PS One. The only somewhat positive part of this game is the AI in that you race against more racers at a time than in TT. Overall, I wish I had saved my money. Two thumbs down."
2,its ok i guess,ok so i rented this game because i herd it was pretty cool.well i played it while i had it and omg its horable the gameplay is the worst nothing near realistic and im a fan of grand tourismo so yea.the graphics are pretty nice though i have to say.overall the game is ok i guess
2,Extinguishers Not Fully Pressurized,"I received the twin pack of Fire Extinguishers and some of the material had leaked during shipment. Neither of them were fully pressurized, as in another user's review. I'm attempting to return this to Garage Toys, but no one ever answers their customer support number and no one has returned the serveral messages I've left in the past week.I would recommend passing on this and picking it up in a local store due to the risk of damange during shipment and the difficulty working with the vendor on a return.UPDATE: Garage Toys finally returned my call after over a week of trying to contact them. They apologized for the hassle and refunded my order completely, and allowed me to keep the extinguishers I received that were not fully pressurized. I was very satisfied with how they handled the situation besides the delay in getting back to me."
2,Fair buy,Both fire extinguishers weren't full of material and not fully pressurized. I am half-satisfied.
3,Same less than full pressurized problem,"bought two 2-packs of these from costco.MAKE SURE you check how full they are. one of them came out of the bear nearly empty! Had to return one box to costco,"
4,nice product,"I just bought a ventless fireplace and thought that just in case I should have a extinguisher on hand. Shipping was fast and I believe these could put out a fire if caught fast enough. Excellent Idea if you burn candles, have a fire place, or a very bad chef in the house."
3,Amusing but not memorable,"Ms. Notaro is fun to read because she is openly mean and selfish, traits within all of us no matter how we try to disguise them. Reading her book is like watching a car wreck; it isn't GOOD, but you think, ""Thank goodness that isn't me!"" That being said, I didn't find the book to be interesting or memorable. Sure, I can identify with fat ankles and calves, and having too many books in the house (we fight over my books and his stereo equipment), and even finding a mouse (although ours was a cockroach), but just because I can identify with it doesn't make it funny. There are authors whom I don't identify with at all, like Augusten Burroughs and David Sedaris (I'm not male or gay, nor do I have a history of drug abuse or particularly crazy family dynamics) but I enjoyed their books, because they move beyond admitting their foibles, and actually embrace them and make them into satire. Ms. Notaro almost gets there, but not quite, leaving her stories pithy rather than endearing."
2,Just okay.,"I was really looking forward to this book - after all, I'd read a couple reviews who put Laurie Notaro in the same field as Jen Lancaster. Alas, that was not to be. The stories start out well enough, even if they do tend to jump from place to place with the reader left scratching their head wondering how on earth they've gone from talking about the YMCA to Laurie's mother thinking she's hopped up on LSD - but end, often very abruptly, with no continuation later on.And for the record, a size 14 is not fat. It's not thin, but it's not fat, either, and although I'm below that particular size, I don't think it sends a very good message out. Just my opinion.I tried two books of Notaro's and won't be reading any others. I guess I just thought it would be funnier, not to mention more interesting."
2,"Not much funny, too much whining","I read Laurie Notaro's ""It Looked Different on the Model"" and I really liked it, so I picked up this book thinking it would be similar. The format is the same, a series of short essays, but there was not as much humor in this book. Some of the essays were quite funny and I enjoyed them and some were quite poignant, which I also enjoyed. Unfortunately, many of the essays consist of the author complaining that she is extremely overweight, questioning how that happened, and then whining about how her extreme rudeness gets her in trouble. One chapter on each of these topics could have been entertaining, but the author revisits them too many times and I honestly didn't even want to finish reading this book. It became tiresome and although I'm glad I finished because the last couple of chapters were good, I could have done without a great deal of the middle."
4,Prettier,"This is my third Laurie Notaro book, and so far this has been my least favorite. Compared to how funny, and how hard I laughed through It Looked Different on the Model, this fell a little short for me. It did however, still entertain me, and I will continue reading the rest of her books. I find her humor and outlook on life to be very similar to mine, and she can write humor and sarcasm like no other. I look forward to the next installment, and love to relax and laugh along with Mrs. Notaro."
4,Her self-deprecating humor delivers the laughs,"Another reviewer once said there should be a 4.5 and she's right! If I'd never read a Laurie Notaro book, this would be a definite 5. But I've read five others and so it came in just under the high-flying scale. She has me totally convinced that she's the dorkiest girl alive until I realize that she's admitted that - so it's a Catch-22. You can't be truly dorky if you know you are...I can so relate to the crazy things that happen to Laurie as she lives out her life in a seemingly haphazard fashion. Much of the stuff she does I do myself. What no one does as well as Laurie Notaro is describe the events so that you are waiting for one outcome and are totally surprised by another. She's got gumption, that gal - and she regularly makes me laugh out loud in this book, like all the others."
2,",","The book banks on it's ability to amuse but if you look closely at the end of each sentence there is a tiny image of Porky Pig saying ""That's all folks!"""
1,Disappointed,I expected this book to be extremely funny but I was disappointed. I didn't even bother finishing it. I laughed maybe twice. I would not recommend this book if you are looking for something funny.
4,Good book,I recieved this book in a very timely matter and it was in good condition. Looked a little bent but not bad I would order from this company again.
3,Good Mindless Reading,"There were certainly some funny parts... Ms. Notaro is clever and wry. I'm not going to run out and tell all my friends to read it, but if you need an entertaining break from heavier literature, this would make a good pit stop."
2,Had a hard time getting through this one,"Notaro's first book was absolutely fantastic. Unfortunately, I relied on the humor of the first book to influence me into buying the entire series. What a mistake that was. This book referenced her descriptions to others so much that I was quickly bored with it. It appears that she is believing her own hype."
5,"Fantastic Book, Fantastic Author",This was my first Laurie Notaro book. It is by far the funniest book I've ever read. Funny really doesn't even begin to describe it. I don't think I've ever laughed so hard reading a book. I took it with me to a doctor's appointment and I'm pretty sure that the entire waiting room thought I was insane. What I like best is that the humor is continuous throughout the book. I laughed with each page (and sometimes each paragraph). There are pieces that I still laugh when I think about them. The other wonderful thing about this book is that I can relate. Ms. Notaro is talking about things that happen to all of us and shows us the humor in everyday life. I plan on reading everything that Laurie Notaro has written and I recommend this book to everyone.
5,Great Read,"This book had me laughing from the beginning. I love how she taps into the 30 something crowd. I could relate to many of thestories in this book. I great, fun read. I can't wait to read more of her books!"
4,"More Laurie Notaro, please!","In the past few months, I've become a huge fan of Laurie Notaro's work. Sure, the writng could be better, but the stories she tells about her life are so funny that its hard to believe that they're all true! In We Thought You Would Be Prettier, we re-meet the nutty members of Laurie's family: her Nana, her mother, her nephew, and her husband, who patiently puts up with her crazyness. Here, Notaro begins by going on her book tour and being called ""stupid"" in New York City, and ends up moving from Arizona to Oregon. For the past four books Laurie's been complaining about the heat; what will she have to complain about in her new hometown/ next book?I love how Laurie Notaro is willing to put her life out there for the world to see. Some of the ways she phrases things are hillarious, and at other times I found myself nodding, thinking, ""wow, she is so right about that!"" In all, this book was right on par with all her others. Of course, I'm going right out and buying her next."
2,Dates itself quickly,"I'm not generally a reader of the ""modern sassy-girl telling various stories in an episodic format"" genre. I bought this book about 4 years ago, and then lost it to the black hole that is my parents' storage when they moved while I was away at college.I just found it and decided to restart it.First of all, it seems a main problem with this genre seems to be how quickly the references and jokes become dated. That certainly is true with this book. There are several times where the jokes or references can instantly peg this book as having been written in 2003-2005, and no longer really are that funny.Second of all, though there were many genuinely funny parts, there were several times when it really felt like she was trying way way too hard to be funny, and those times it fell flat.This is not a genre I'll be seeking out at my local book store."
1,couldn't even finish it!,"I thought I was going to LOVE this book as it appeared to be hysterical and had me oddly intrigued when i read the description and the back of the book. However, I could BARELY get through this book and literally had to force myself to continue reading it sometimes, hoping it got better in the next chapter. It didn't. I admit there are some stories that had me chuckling, but most of it was just boring and stupid. I agree with some of the other reviewers that it just seemed she was trying to hard to be ""clever"" and funny. It just didn't happen for me. I finally gave up and tossed the book before I even finished it."
4,Hilarious and true!,"The title says it all, in this collection of humorous real-life essays. Notaro recollects various household disasters, problems finding cute clothes sized for a real woman's body, childhood traumas and more in a straightforward manner that is pee-in-your-pants hilarious. This is definitely a hard-to-put-down read, and I'll be looking forward to checking out Ms. Notaro's other works."
5,A funny read,"Normally I abstain from chick lit, so I put off reading this book for a couple years. I'd read some of Notaro's earlier stuff and thought it was somewhat funny to a plump, dateless lady who lived in a small town. But with this latest effort I think Notaro has achieved universal appeal.The one liners, observations and deft narrative come fast and furious. Notaro is quick with an acid tongued put down, but she puts down nobody like she does herself. Apparently she can take it as well as dish it out.If you're a fan of Tina Fey or Fran Leibowitz and are unfamiliar with Notaro I think you'll enjoy it. And for a true sample of her at her jaded, ""wallowing in self pity"" best, if you're only going to read one Notaro book, this should be the one.The Idiot Girls' Action-Adventure Club: True Tales from a Magnificent and Clumsy Life"
5,Absolutely hilarious,"I've had to stop reading Laurie's books on the bus because I laugh out loud so hard people think I'm going into convulsions. She nails it perfectly - things we've all experienced in one way or another but never laughed so hard about. Keep 'em coming, Laurie !"
3,"Had High Expectations For a ""Meh"" Book","I read the whole thing (more out of stubborness than enjoyment) and there were some genuine chuckles that came out, but I was pretty let-down by this one. It feels like Notaro is just trying too hard to be funny. We get it - you're the dorkiest girl alive. Pity and disgust aren't emotions that comedic books are supposed to evoke. If I wanted to spend two hours listening to a crazy fat girl b**ch about the things that drive her crazy, I could just hang out with my old room-mate. At least she would have bought me a martini for my time."
3,We Thought This Would Be Funnier...,"I loved Notaro's second collection of essays,Autobiography of a Fat Bride: True Tales of a Pretend Adulthood, so I had some high hopes to see this collection follow along that path. Unfortunately, this entire collection, though it followed the same essay format as her other books, only contained a few laugh-out-loud-funny parts. There weren't any essays in this collection that particularly stood out to me, unlike the previous collections. I just didn't really like this one as much... There wasn't anything wrong with it, no glaring issues to point fingers at, but I just didn't find it as entertaining as the others. I just can't put my finger on what exactly it was lacking, but something was definitely missing... Her other collections were a lot stronger, and more entertaining."
2,Not Worth the Price,"This honey is very mild and smooth. But the price is so out of whack with the quality of this honey. This honey is known to everyone in Hawaii as Keawa honey. It is not rare! Keawe is just mesquite from the mesquite trees which flourish in the southwestern United States and Mexico. The jar is so much smaller than I expected from its magnified picture. The price is outrageous and what irritated me more than anything was that no where could I find the amount of honey being offered at this price in ounces, or grams, etc. It was like a hit or miss and I guess it's a miss for me."
5,This is what they eat in Paradise?,"What can be said about this honey? That it is unique, but so is, say, Thyme honey. That it is rare, but so are many other things in life. That it is expensive, that goes without saying. Wink, wink, check out some promotion with your local Co-Op or organic food store and chances are you may find it for under $10.As for its nutritive or medical value there is not much one can tell/learn about this honey. However, on a sensory level (taste, and smell), this honey is truly outstanding. It has a way of melting in your mouth that fills you through your senses with joy. Still on a sensory level, I even detect some taste as of beewax--pleasant, in an intriguing way.To make a long (love) story short, if I were to employ a taste/cost type of metric to characterize this opportunity in taste then Hawaiian White Honey would have topped many a food chart; Enjoy it!"
5,perfect!,Although this is not a part that can be bad or make any mistakes other then sizing.. I have to say its a very good quality part and fits perfect!!!
5,Great shoes! Stylish and durable!,"I have been through everything with this shoe. Hiking, rover rafting, and my school. The only gripe is that the shoe is a heavy but it makes a great look with black Volcom crew socks and a pair of Dicky's shorts."
3,good,"quality looks good! comfortable, but not reach my expection. now is hard to find the white color of this shoes."
2,Comfortable shoes but can't wash them,"I bought these shoes in white for a holiday. They were comfortable and the right size. The problem is, I wore them once and made them slightly dirty. I figured I am going to wash them. What a mistake!!! I washed them from the top and inside with plain water. It looked like they were now clean. I set them to dry overnight on a chair. I wake up in the morning to see and now instead of white pair shoes, I had a rusty pair of shoes. There is some sort of rust all over the shoes. It looks like there was some chemical in the shoes that came out when they were washed. I now can't wear them anywhere. Have to throw them out. What a shame to throw out $50. The shoes should come with a warning that you can't wash these shoes. Very disappointed.On the positive side, I looked really nice in them during the holiday while they were clean :)"
3,Comfy and Easy,"If your lazy, like me, you'll love these shoes. especially if your a teen who has to wake up early in the morning. I got a size a lil smaller than i hoped but they have been on me since i got them. Now I don't ever want to take them off."
4,Favorites,I bought these for my daughter to replace another of the same which she wore for a year. These arrived quickly and were just as expected. Her new favorite pair of shoes.
4,Great shoes!,"I've been wearing these shoes for some time now, I've also enjoyed the slip-ons. They last me about two years before they break down, but that's about what I expect for a shoe of this price."
2,Not his best work,"I love Macaulay - The Way THings Work, Castle, Unbuilding, etc. My dad's an architect and I've always appreciated DM's drawing style and sense of humor. The story and humor of this book are severely lacking. It's just not funny. It's an artifact of the 80's, but not a cool one like Ferris Bueller's Day Off or a centerfold from a dusty 1983 Playboy at a garage sale. It's the part of the 80's where maybe everyone was all coked out and you didn't really need to be that funny for people to think you were great. I'm planning on giving this away to a child, and then I will secretly be pretty disappointed in them if they like it very much. On the other hand, every other Macaulay book they read will be much better, so I'm making a positive difference."
2,A Poor Man's Hollywood Babylon,"Of course this book is entertaining; it is filled with gossip about some of the most loved classic movie stars.However, it is completely trashy, false, and disgraceful. A lot of the information in this book like dates and ages are wrong. What makes the reader think that the more controversial information would be true then? Well, it isn't. Most of the information in this book was taken from Hollywood Babylon, a notoriously false book about the sex lives and scandals of famous movie stars. This book is only a cheap version of that book. Don't waste your time or your money."
1,*sigh*,"I literally threw the book down after reading the first couple pages.First off, after glancing at the pictures, the one labeled Jean Harlow...I am 90% sure that it is not her. Secondly, the trash he wrote about Olive Thomas made me want to toss the book in a fire. Her first husband never made her his sex slave and other disgusting nonsense he puts forth.If you want books about the love lives about silver screen icons, I suggest reading books by Jane Ellen Wayne."
3,"Good publication, but read critically","New African is a generally well-written magazine, covering a wide variety of topics for the whole continent. However - it seems to have a strong pro-Mugabe (Zimbabwe) bias, to the point that many suspect it is a ZANU party mouthpiece. As with any media, read critically and compare to other sources."
5,i love it,Victorinox is notorious for fine products. This knife isn't your everyday pocket knife. As you can see it has two blades. It's much larger than what you would call a pocket knife. It's larger blade is big and really sharp. If you had to shave with it you could. REALLY SHARP!! All I can say is it's a beauty.
2,You get what you pay for,"Cheap cables brake cables. They don't have a lubricated inner lining like nicer cables, resulting in a lot of resistance in cable actuation. Get something better for a bit more money."
5,Brake cables and housing,"I needed these but didnt want to spend 18-20 bucks at a local retail store. These seem to work fine. They come with a cable, housing, tips and everything you need to completely replace your existing cable. Plenty of length so you can cut to adjust it and cut again if you mess up."
3,An Absurd commentary on the death of the American Dream,"Edward Albee, in his typical Theatre of the Absurd manner, portrays the death of the American Dream in this theatrical presentation. If you take an interest in Albee or Absurdists in general, I would recommend this play."
2,An Absurd Mannered Play,"Edward Albee's piece of literature is a play that any absurdist would enjoy. Albee's style of writing is very negative and immoral. He uses many motifs throughout the play, irony, and no symbols to reveal his message. His motifs support the central message of the characters' obsessions with surface appearances. Verbal irony is also significant, because it foreshadows many events in the play. Albee's theme of this work is how the characters in the play are obsessed with the exterior, or physical features, of an object or person and do not pay any attention to the interior. I personally did not enjoy the play."
4,Titillating Page Turner,"Great romp! I read the original British version, ""The Movie"". Bagshawe has the requisite skill for this type of escapist fiction - sexy, witty (at times), tongue-in-cheek, femme fatale fantasies come to life. No aspirations for great literature although the writing is very good. Her first novel, Career Girls, is more thrilling. Reading her books makes you feel like a very clever, attractive, sophisticated babe who can conquer the world. You can't help but root for her heroines - brainy babes with laser-like focus. Also read her third novel, Tall Poppies, whose story lags a bit compared to the previous two. Saw her fourth novel on the shelves of my neighborhood library today: Venus Envy."
3,Louise Bagshawe entertains with an edge.,"I have to wonder just what Louise Bagshawe intended with _Triple Feature_. As a run of the mill, summer-at-the-beach, escapist yarn, this book serves nicely, and even offers occasionally evocative writing.But under the surface, beyond stock characters and cliched developments, lurks something rather intelligent. Ms. Bagshawe presents a ""perfect"" movie script, without bothering to try and write one. Actually, she makes this mysterious thing more interesting in abstentia than it would have been spelled out.And these characters are just too idealized. They are too ""Hollywood."" This was probably the intent, but as Ms. Bagshawe creates a fantasy, she manages to parody it as well.In the end, Ms. Bagshawe becomes something of a literary Jerry Springer. As she gives the reading public what it wants, she seems to be hiding a sardonic smile backstage. And this makes it half way worthwhile."
5,Perfect,"This item is quite lovely and it turned out to be perfect for our needs. Unlike other reviewers, we were actually extremely happy to find that there where no pins on the candelabra because we planned to use the battery-operated ""flicker candles"" with it (no fire hazard). Although, we do agree that the picture should accurately represent what the customer is buying - we almost didn't buy this because of the pins."
2,Ordered 2 - both had same flaw,"I ordered two of these. I love the piece, but both of them had the same flaw - the spot for the front candle was bent back and slanted so much that you can't put a candle on it. Maybe that's why they are selling at a discount??"
5,Good Price - Relatively quick shipping,Product arrived just as advertised. Much less expensive that other sources.
5,Always stick with OEM,I always stick with OEM equipment for my printer/computer perhiperals. What else can I say? It's worth to get HP stuff for your HP printer because you know it will work near perfect.
2,Not what I thought I was getting,"My fault for not looking more closely at the product description which does say it is a remanufactured cartridge. My fault too for not scrolling down and reading the reviews. I had the exact same reaction as eosruss: the photo depicting OEM packaging was enticing and misleading, as was the advertised retail savings of 87%! I'm pretty sure HP doesn't charge $43.10 for a *remanufactured* product. I assumed OCProducts had an overstock of geniune HP cartridges which they were liquidating as a gonga deal. Silly moi.The good news is that I've used remanufactured cartridges many times before, without difficulties or complaints. I don't anticipate a problem here either. The two-star review is the slap OCProducts gets for deceptive advertising. They might have gotten five stars if they hadn't cloaked their generic product behind the gleaming gloss of an authentic HP product. BADLY DONE!"
4,"Learned a lesson the hard way, not a good idea to keep a spare...","...unless you know you will be using it soon. I don't do that much printing but thought it would be a good idea to keep a spare, nothing like running out in the middle of a print job. Bad idea!This is where there must be a little dumb blond in me. Not only did I try to use the cartridge but went through a whole smorgasbord of troubleshooting. LOL!When I got one that was current had no problem and did the job fine."
1,BlueEye DT,"HP 45 (51645A#140) Black Ink Cartridge (Electronics)Picture on the web site as viewed when ordering showed OEM box for ink cartridges. They also stated as Condition: NEW not REMANFACTURED. What arrived WAS NOT OEM packaged ink cartridges - but generic cartridges.Concerned these generic cartridges will present issues when used, such as clogging of print heads, etc.Disappointed but not willing to spend money to ship them back."
5,Great Ink,"This ink is great and lasts a long time and compared to other models, the ink isn't outrageouly priced."
4,Better than most,"This ink is good quality and lasts longer than the cartridges of the other brands I've used (Epson, Brother)."
5,Good quality and service,"Although the cartridge looked a bit old, it works very good. No leaking, good price, and quick delivery."
2,MYSTERY CARTRIDGE....,"The ink cartridge arrived without the exterior package, so there is no way of knowing the expiration date. The cartridge itself has a dusty film on it, so I suspect it's usefulness will be rather limited. I gave it 2 stars as the old one in my printer is still functioning, so the real mystery of this ""new"" one won't be revealed until I begin using it!"
2,"Received in Open-Box condition, had to return.","Arrived Promptly, but was open-box condition with Ink smeared on the printhead under the protective tape. Appeared to have been used."
4,As Easy-To-Refill Ink Cartridge,"I have been using the same HP952C Deskjet Printer for about 10 years now because it uses the HP 45 cartridge, which is easy to refill. It only cost me $1.50 in ink to refill the cartridge using InkTec ink. If I had to buy a new cartridge each time, it would be pricey, but probably no more so than other inkjet printers. Print quality is consistently good."
3,"Ok for the money, easy to install and still has ink after heavy use.","What can one say about an ink cartridge? It installed easily and worked. I used it pretty heavily for awhile and it still have some ink left. I got the refurbished one for a total of I think $7 so it was worth it just for that project. The retail price is pretty steep; I'd be interested in if it lasts longer or why there's such a price difference. Ink quality, etc?"
2,970Cse,"We use an HP 970Cse. The black and white works ok, but the color doesn't come out well in the 970Cse. So we replaced it with an Epson Stylus C84 and are much happier. Also, the HP 970Cse printed REALLY SLOOOWWWWW in color....we tried all sorts of options to no avail."
3,It is ink for your printer.,"I am writing this review because amazon.com sent an email that states, 'We invite you to submit a review for the products you purchased. Your input will help other customers choose the best products and help Amazon.com continually improve the customer experience.'It is very nice ink."
3,Works as advertised,"I've used this machine in my home office for about a year. While not perfect, I had to reload the software once, it's been otherwise troublefree, it works well, faxes and scans. I use a different, more economical dedicated printer for day to day printing, that's not its strength. If you want a nice scanner/fax that can copy too this does it. The utility page that opens up each time it's used is straightforward and easy to use and understand."
4,Does the job well,"I've had the HP DeskJet 722C for over a year now. I have been happy with the performance of the black inkjet cartridge, and have only had to replace it twice. I don't have especially heavy print needs; I am a computer professional, however, and I estimate that I am perhaps an average printer user. The ink dries quickly, and I have not had the ""smudge"" complaint that I had heard from a friend (who told me AFTER I purchased this printer)"
1,Old cartridges - warranty expired,"I received a twin pack of HP 45 cartridges on June 30, 2011. The warranty as stated on the package expires in July 2011. When I contacted SophiaGlobal, they said they would warrant the cartridges for an additional 2 years. I decided to keep the cartridges, but I feel (for Truth in Advertising) that they should have noted in the ad that they were old cartridges. They stated in an email ""we have sold hundreds of OEM HP ink cartridges with expired warranty dates over the last few years"". So be sure to ask before ordering if you want ""fresh"" ink.Bob"
4,Gets the job done,"Let's face it, how much can you really say about an ink cartridge? Using this on my HP970cxi produces very good print quality. The biggest problem I've had with the cartridges has been a tendency to dry up more quickly than they should. A couple of them have gone dry far too soon after purchase both in terms of time and the number of sheets printed. Fortunately, most of them hold up for a reasonable period of time. The bottom line is that you need ink cartridges to use your printer and this is a good cartridge even if it isn't perfect."
2,"OK, But needs more ink!",This cartridge holds a nice deep black ink that makes great smudge-free print. My only gripe is the cartridge should last longer than 500 pages before I run out of ink. (sigh) If only HP made these like their test equipment.....
5,Seventh Star review,"If your looking for a heavy hardcore album in the vein of Hatebreed, then you'll love Seventh Star's latest album, ""Dead End."" I ordered it off of amazon.com because a friend of mine told me it was avalible there, and that it was a good CD. The lyrics are inspiring, the music is brutal, and the energy is amazing. i'd recommend it to anyone who likes heavy music. I heard their first release; it was pretty good, but this latest one, ""Dead End"" destroys it. Its a must have."
3,"For Some, But Not For All","Straight to the point - Let me just say that the guitars rock in this band. The problem is that they decided to mix the rock sound with a heavy-metal screamer lead singer and a slow to nitro-fast drummer. I love heavy-metal, I love hard rock...but it doesnt sound quite right with both mixed together. I almost gave this 4 stars simply because when I listen to this cd on my stereo, I crank up the guitar sound and quiet down the vocals - then I realized not everybody listens to it that way so I went ahead and clipped it down to 3. Everything takes off after track 2 - the guitarist has it goin on as far as being a rock artist/riffer but the rest need to go off and make a heavy-metal band somewhere with the right kind of guitarist that fits the sound."
5,Eye Opener,"After reading the Bible I knew there was much more that I had not been taught in my Presbyterian USA church. I had an incredibale spiritual transformation at 16 and all I knew was that I had been ""born again"". 20 years later I begin to search and found this book. I knew that I could relate to an Episcoplian Priest. He explained a prayer language (tongues)and helped me to understand exactly what it was and how to actually activate it in my life. A MUST for those who are digging deeper and that believe."
4,Ants got to them before we did,They were probably really good. The ants thought so anyway. The ants got to them before we could. I do not know if the ants got there from wherever they were shipped or from sitting on my porch.
2,Broken but customer service is OK,"It arrived within 4 days of ordering. Pulled it out of the box and it looked decent, something I could definitely give as a higher end present. (I spent $55 with shipping charges too.)Unfortunately, when my friend hooked it up, there was a hole on the bottom that leaked the water and a piece (tube) was missing.I contacted their customer service and got an immediate response. They said they would send me a return shipping label and cover the costs to return and will mail me a new fountain(hopefully in good condition this time!).The customer service rep has been great, but beware of getting a damaged product. I hear these kind of fountains leak easily so you can't expect the world."
1,Quick return,"I bought this fountain thinking it was made of real stones. It isn't. it looked good enough though so I figured I would give it a try. i plugged it in and everything worked fine except that the little pump is louder than the water so you don't get soothed just annoyed, plus the base doesn't nearly catch all the water that falls so water goes everywhere. My advice to buyers. Pass this one up unless you just want to look at it. My advice to Alpine. Tell the folks in China to rethink this one. It no workie.Stacked Rocks Indoor Fountain"
2,Ehhh,Very slow...it took forever to build the story but then I felt like it ended in the middle of the book...not the end. I felt very let down.
3,Meh,"This book had such a good potential, i mean the story is there but instead it was very bland and nothing happened in the story and the end well it wasn't really an end it was just... boring"
4,"Good, reusable fun","My 8-yr-old daughter wanted Bendaroos for Christmas, but I have a bias against ""as seen on TV"" purchases. So, we got the American-made Wikkis, and she's been very pleased. I will say that the toy is not as reusable as touted - anything dipped in waxed is going to pick up lint and pet fur if it touches the ground. On the other hand, she's had a lot of fun with the toy. I would recommend this as a good item to encourage creativity and keep kids busy on the run."
5,They Like Them!,My grandsons enjoy playing with these. We needed something quiet to keep their hands busy during church services and Wikki sticks work. It is fun to see them use their imaginations to make different things.
2,Short-term entertainment,"My 7 year-old daughter begged for ""bendaroos,"" which are sold on TV. I purchased these instead, which are basically the same thing. When she finally got them she only played with them for about 5 mins. You basically just twist the waxy sticks into different shapes. I think maybe it would have been very popular 50 years ago; but today kids are so used to high-tech toys that something this simple and ""quiet"" is not as appealing. Sad, but it is what it is. The product description says that it comes with a ""handy storage bag"" but does not -- unless they are referring to the plasic bag that they come in and in which you have to rip to open. I read some of the other reviews before I purchased this, and think that they must have been referring to toddler-age children that can still find fun in the simple."
5,Getting to Know You,"Reading ""In the Wings"" is an exciting discovery. This is not your run-of-the-mill Hollywood celebrity puff piece, although the cares and joys of the celebrity life are all there. Rather, Bermuda-born Diana Douglas Darrid chronicles the life of a working actress who was married to a superstar, Kirk Douglas, and give birth to another, Michael Douglas. After her divorce from Kirk, she was a single mother of two boys, Michael and Joel, whom she raised alone for some years while continuing her career in film, theater and television. This is a real page-turner, an honest and candid look into the life of a marvelous woman, the kind of person you would wish to have as a friend."
2,In The Wings,"Book was too much about her acting carrer on stage and in movies, not much about her marriage to actor Kirk Douglas.Boring"
5,Objective Study,"Any open minded person that reads this book will quickly discover the obvious; The Black community in Shaker Heights, Ohio is in deep need of Dr. Phil McGraw's ""Self Matters."" Ogbu produces page upon page of community respondents culturally brainwashed to focus their intellect on a history they have not lived, and an available future that they cannot fathom. Ogbu's tone is harsh. His main argument: The Black community's cultural beliefs and practices are not conducive to success in academics. This is where the controversy lies. Because the book doesn't blame the testing gap on White racism, his analysis must be wrong. Simply read what students themselves are saying and draw your own conclusions."
5,Under recognized game,"I bought this game new from Electronics Boutique(...) . It was the cheapest game they had. At first, when I took it home I looked at the graphics and thought I got what I paid for. I almost returned it. Then my mother who doesn't play any games played this one with me and beat me. I started to appreciate the skill necessary to play the game. Although I am still not very good at it, I can certainly appreciate the game more. It has photo realistic cars, and beautiful 3d rendering techniques. It is graphically flawless. If I were to design a racing game it would at its best turn out like R Racing Evolution. (...)a fantastic game to try and conquer"
3,"Fun game, but short","This game is fun - the range & style of cars available is nice. The main thing that prevented me from giving it a higher score is that the story mode is too short. You will want to purchase a steering wheel controller to get the most out of this game, also."
2,Es como una carrera de Tortugas.,"Definitivamente este juego tiene muy buenos graficos y excelente banda sonora. Pero una carrera con carros que parecen unas tortugas (por lo lento), no es carrera.Si lo que buscas en un juego de carros apacionante, donde la adrenalina te ponga a vibrar, te recomiendo Burnout 2 y Project Gottam Racing 2. Son los mejores!!!."
2,Somethings take a good picture...,"I am a fan of the better named multitools. I love thie features, useability, and how they always come in handy. As such, I like to find deals so that I can keep extra ones in the car or toolbox etc. I knew going in to this that for the price it was too good to be true. However, sometimes it can be ok to buy ""just good enough"" if you aren't expecting much and don't plan on needing it a whole lot.First off, this is just worse of a tool than I orginally figured. I know that it says it is a mini tool, but when I received it, it was down right small, not very strong, and not useable. In short, I just don't believe this is a good tool and even when onsale I believe it is better to go with a better name brand tool for five to ten dollars more and be happier in the long run."
1,"Not a Good Buy, Bad Customer Service!","Unit is not as accurate as claim, not easy to use and also Bad customer Service, Amazon lower the price of this item two days after I order, I request a credit they say no they don't guarantee prices, what a load of crap. Never will use Amazon again. Bad, bad Amazon!"
1,omron cuff is joke,"Cuff is a joke. After using it for two weeks, the cuff became very hard to use, causing the monitor to fail, and I have junked it, and went back to my old Eckerd's bp monitor."
2,Review Omron HEM-790IT,It is easy to use and the pc software is good. The problem I have is that I'm 62 and my wife is 59 and we are having the best blood pressure readings of our life. I don't thing the blood pressure reading are correct.
4,Omron HEM-790IT,We are very happy with the Omron HEM-790IT Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with Advance Omron Health Management Software. The software was easy to install and download our information from the blood pressure machine.
1,ComFit DOES NOT WORK on Skinny arms....!!!!!,It may be a comfortable fit but the velcro gives as it inflates....so if you want a lower reading this is the way to go. I can't believe so many good reviews and no one talks about the problems with the comfit design. If you have a big fat arm it works better. Go with the standard arm pressure strap.
5,Omron HEM-79IT Blood Pressure Monitor,"I bought this gadget from Amazon a few weeks ago after my doctor recommended that I monitor my blood pressure twice a day and submit a monthly report to him so he can make adjustments to my prescriptions. This monitor is everything anyone needs to be able to do this efficiently and without hassle. I just fit the adjustable sleeve around my left arm, press a button and voila! It reads my blood pressure and keeps it in memory. I keep this gadget connected to my computer thru a USB port. The software that comes with it, receives the daily readings and reports everything in graph or numerical format. I can then either print it or email it to my doctor. This was a great purchase that is helping maintain my quality of life."
1,Comfit Cuff Sucks!,"Don't buy this unit. The Comfit Cuff is nothing but a gimmick, and very difficult to use. I constantly get error readings, and am having to redo it by fiddling with the cuff, and reattaching the velcro. Software is a joke too, very much an old program. I am very unhappy with this purchaseMy advice is just buy a cheaper unit with a standard cuff. I should have known better."
3,Software not ready for prime time.,"Pros: Very easy to use and get single readings and averages for two users. Has a guest mode.Cons: a) Can only use for two users; b) Cannot delete a reading if say you used it on a visitor accidentally; c) the software is primitive; d) data cannot be transferred to other software such as Excel or used to make a spreadsheet.In other words, if you paid extra for the computer functionality you may be disappointed. Not ready for prime time."
2,Cuff needs to be larger,"I think the unit is a quality piece of gear and the software is pretty cool but the unit reads at least 10mmHg too high compared to side by side doctor readings. The unit claims to come with a cuff big enough for very large arms and my 14"" arms are well within the range they list but my doctor always uses a large cuff on me. I emailed the company to see if they had a larger cuff, they do not. They don't accept returns unless the product is defective. It reads fine on my apartment-mate."
3,why electronic device cannot be a little more correct,"I try this monitor several times. It is not easy to let it have a stable value for anybody's blood pressure, though the difference is not so big. It is said to be the defect of electronic monitors. I think it can be improved more anyway."
1,Cannot get it past an error indication,I have been trying to use this item ever since I purchased to keep track of my blood pressure and almost every I try to use it it keeps giving an error indication.I put it on as tight as I can in accordance to the directions given and start it. It pumps for a few seconds and then stops with a flashing 'E'. Only a very few times has it gone through the process to measure my BP and it frustrates me. As I indicated I put it on as tight as I am able and it fails more often than not to give me blood pressure. I most likely wasted my money on this tirm!!!
2,Too many error messages,"The monitor looks great. I am about 170lbs., average build. The cuff feels tight on my arm, as a result, it overinflates and gives an error message. When I try to loosen the cuff,I get an underinflation error.You sort of get impatient when using this monitor. As a result, your pressure goes up. GREAT!"
3,Omron/ Hem-790IT,I've found the unit useful as a reference only when checking my pressure. When I went to the doctors office a couple of times I found the numbers off on both diastolic and systolic off by about 5 to 10 points higher then the traditonal doctors mercury tester. I checked it with her immediately after she did it. Will call company to find out if it needs an adjustment.
3,OK BP monitor,I bought this monitor for it's computer input feature. It does upload the data to a proprietary program and graphs blood pressure. I would rather have it wireless. I would also like a unit that would transfer the data to the Fitbit site. The cuff is hard to put on by myself. Usually I get it too loose. It may be reading a bit high according to my doctor.
4,satisfied,quite satisfired with this product. It is fairly easy to use and accurate although rather bulky especially if one has to travel with it.
4,Omron HEM-790IT,"The Omron HEM-790IT is very fast & easy to use for taking blood pressure readings. I am disappointed with the software though, which is the main reason I purchased this model. It doesn't work with Windows 7, but it did load onto my Windows 2000 machine. The program is a bit difficult to use and the printouts are of very poor quality, but it does work. Improving the software would make this a great little monitor!"
2,"readings are good, but I get error messages more often than readings","I bought the HEM-790IT two months ago and monitor my blood pressure at least three times a week. The readings are consistent with manual readings at my doctor's office, so I don't have the accuracy problems some reviewers have found. Unfortunately, the cuff gives very frequent error messages, and this seems to be increasing with time. Even when holding my breath, and trying my best not to move at all, I frequently have to try 3 or 4 times to actually get a reading. Once, it took 10 attempts. A review I recently read suggested squeezing the cuff until it gets past the 30 mm mercury reading to avoid this problem. I will try doing this, but the instrument clearly has a problem with errors at startup."
3,Omron having a QC problem?,"I've used this product since February 2009. When it's working, it's a great tool. However, I've experienced two problems which look like quality control issues. First, I often have to jiggle the batteries and power adapter before it will start up. Second, when transferring data to the history tracking software on my PC, I also have to jiggle the USB connection before the software will recognize the device and initiate the transfer. Not fatal flaws by any means, but I've come to expect more from Omron (I have their wrist pressure reader and it's worked flawlessly for the past three years. I think I got a ""touchy"" unit and should have returned it but never got around to it. My bad."
3,Reading True,"Omron HEM-790IT Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with Advanced Omron Health Management SoftwareMy doctor had great reservations regarding my previous monitor that took its reading from your finger. Having used this new one a few weeks, I continue to wonder how accurate automatic BP monitors can be. Maybe I just don't know enough about how variable ones blood pressure can be. Measures taken fairly close in time can vary on this machine from being very ""normal"" to abnormally high within a time span from 10 to 30 minutes. The bells and whistles on this model are very nice in theory. However, if you cannot trust the measurements, it is all for naught."
2,Omron HEM-790IT Blood Pressure Monitor Never Same Results Twice,"I've been using the Omron HEM-790IT monitor for almost a month now and I'm not impressed with it. It seems that the arm cuff can't stay tight while the monitor is running. I hear the velcro crackling while the test is underway. I've tried the cuff tight, loose, lower, higher on my arm. Always get the velcro crackling on each test!When I run tests right after each other I get different results. This is not good thing. It makes me wonder which is the correct (if any) result.If Omron replaced the arm cuff with one like a doctor has (a velcro strap with a metal tightening bar, this machine would probably be reliable. Otherwise, the flimsy arm cuff seems to be a major problem.As for the unit itself, it is a nice piece of electronics. I just wish I could get the same readings twice!Fix the arm cuff Omron!!"
3,control your pressure,"Product shipped fine, on time, etc. Found that the machines reading were not accurate according to other machines and the Doctors office. Had to create a fudge factor to see if I was having a problem or not. Great device though. Found that returns via shipping a pain verses going to a store and trading out. Just my opinion."
5,Nice unit,Nice product. Syncs well with my computer. My only (small) complaint is that you can't delete a reading in the memory.
5,Blood Pressure Monitor,"Have used Omron BP monitors before, and all have given me the same readings that I get at the doctor's office. Two things on the HEM-790IT model that I especially like; the cuff is easy to use, and this model connects to my PC so I can print out my records to take with me to the doctor's office."
2,Problems with the HEM-790IT,I have a problems using the HEM-790IT. I follow the instruction for placing the cuff on my arm and 50% of the time I get an error message. I have the meter set to do the average of 3 reading and sometime it errors on the 2nd or 3rd reading. The other issue is there is no start and stop button so once you turn the meter on it start blowing the cuffup
1,Extremely Disappointed,Product apparently defective. Returned for credit. Tried numerous times on two different people with same results. It will not stop building pressure and had to be stopped manually. Two people with bruised arms. Do not know if this could be a good item if it worked properly but after this experience we will not try another one.
5,Some thoughts after 3 months of use,1. An excellent Product & Software. I recommend using also the Pedometer which comes with the same Software2. The comficuff is not really comfortable to use. I think Omeron should produce a more comfortable cuff. It also tends to wear quickly and it is a pity that Amazon does not sell such accessories separately
3,Good but not sure of the BP lower reading,i brought this product since i needed to check BP for my father . the 2 -3 times that we got it calibrated the Upper BP (Diastolic) was off by 5 points or so and the Lower BP(Systolic) was off my 15-20 points . i like the feature that you can download the reading and view graphically and also get a PDF file and send it to the doctor.so i guess it is OK .
3,Appears to be replaced,"This isn't really a review, because I didn't buy this one, but after some research it looks like it's been replaced by the BP-791IT which is compatible with Microsoft Healthvault. That BP-791IT is also about $100 cheaper."
2,Good but,This monitor worked good for awhile and then it just kept giving me errors. It was not the monitor but the cuff. For some reason I could not get the cuff on tight. It wasn't me because no one could. I called Omron and they were very helpful in telling what the problem was but could not solve it for me. It required two people. One to hold the cuff in place and the other to wrap it around the arm tight. No one could do it alone. I returned it to Costo and purchased a different model Omron and it's cuff works perfectly. We think the problem is that the stiff part of the cover on the first one was spread too wide so it wouldn't wrap right. Maybe if we would have taken it and forced it into a smaller circle it would have bent that way and our problem would have been solved. I wrote to Omron and suggested that they tell the complainers that.
3,Nice machine but....,"I had reservations about this model because of the numerous reports that it doesn't inflate properly. I called Omron & they saidthere wasn't a problem. I liked the features it has, especially the option to connect it to the computer so I purchased it. Well,I also have trouble getting it to inflate properly. I have it set to take three readings but during the first one the cuff doesn't get tight so I assume the readings are not accurate. Sometimes it fails to complete the inflation & creats an error. It just feels like the cuff is too loose on my arm. I would rather have the old flexible type cuff. I haven't even connected it to the computer yet & that was the main reason I purchased this model."
4,Omron HEM-7901IT,"For the price, it is an excellent product.Both my wife and I can use one monitor and keep records separately and download the data to computer is a great advantage."
2,One size fits all cuff doesn't,"This is a promising blood pressure monitor. The problem is that the cuff leads to multiple wrong readings. I've checked it multiple times against my blood pressure in my doctor's office and this is consistently wrong. I'm now looking for one that doesn't have one-size-fits all.And to correct Pajama Guy's review, it's not exported in an Access Database. It's exported in a comma-separated values (CSV) file."
1,poor quality,"I tried this blood pressure gauge many times over a number of days. I could never get a reading over 90/65. I might believe that if I was still in high school, but that was over 40 years ago. My doctors blood pressure gauge and this one were ex termly far apart in the readings. This inaccuracy could be dangerous for people with really high blood pressure, led to believe they were OK with out the meds."
4,ORON HEM-790IT,The ORON HEM-790IT is simple to use and the accompaning software exceed my expectations. Though the download instructions could be clearer overall its easy to use.
4,amron 790it,"Believed to be accurate. Most bells and whistles useful. In depth memory, dual user record and PC download especially so.Me (male) have some difficulty getting adjustment of device without getting error message. Wife (larger circumference upper arm)much easier. Would recommend it."
5,Blood Pressure Monitor is Perfect for Me,"I bought this since it was recommended by several sources. Other than its ease of use, the feature I like best is that it has a mode to do 3 measurements in sequence to get a more reliable reading. I have not used the computer interface feature yet."
4,Omron HEM790IT,"This is the third OMRON blood pressure monitor I have owned. This one has all the bells and whistles that you could ask for. The only problem is the cuff is damn hard to use. It has to be placed in exactly the right position or you will get an error message. Applying hand pressure will help but the best thing I have found is to just readjust the cuff. The software is all right that you can use with your computer, but I find it easier to just use the memory feature. It will give your morning measurement and evening measurements. All of the measurement are given along with the time. It allows two people to use and keep separate records for both. It checked out well with my doctors reading and my other OMRON monitors. I would give it a five but for the cuff. It does have a nice bag to place it in and a nice instruction book."
4,Omron HEM-790IT BP Monitor Review,"Had this product for about a month and it is working as advertised. I have not had it calibrated at my doctor's office, but the results appear to be accurate. SW analysis is excellent."
4,Health Managment Software,Machine works well but had a few issues with the software not recognizing the machine and having to be reinstalled. Overall very good.
1,NOT ACCURATE,"I purchased this unit back in January and paid good money for it thinking Omron had a great piece of equipment that could help me monitor my blood pressure and record it on my PC. When I started to use it at the end of January I found my blood pressure to be high which worried me as it has been normal my whole life. I visited my doctor a couple of times up to now and he said it was normal. He suggested I bring in the unit when I have my physical which was yesterday. When he took a reading on his unit it was 130/70 and a pulse of 80 then it was taken on the Omron unit and read 159/98 and a pulse of 81. Only the pulse was accurate. I now have to pay shipping, insurance and an $8 check required by Omron to have this unit function properly. What a great warranty program - NOT!"
4,Simple to use!,"This couldn't be easier to use, just put your upper arm in the adjustable cuff and push a button. It also has two modes for taking the blood pressure, one that is a single reading, and the other that is three readings which are taken one minute apart and then averaged. Apparently this is more accurate than the other, however it doesn't seem to make much difference in my overall averages.I gave this product only four stars because the software that comes with it is not compatible with Vista Operating System; understandable with new operating systems, but Vista has been out a while.Otherwise a great, easy to use product."
5,Excellent BP Meter,"I've only used the Panasonic EW 3109 for two weeks now, but have found it to be very satisfactory and apparently quite accurate (one ""reference check"" thus far at my doctor's office was very close on both systolic and diastolic.) Much more consistent/repeatable and apparently more accurate overall than an older wrist meter. Not a lot of ""frills"", but plenty of memory, easy to use, and seems pretty robust in construction. Thus far I give it two thumbs up!"
3,BP Monitor,"This monitor is a great monitor if one likes to collect and analyze data. It also provides one the ability to print the data record to present to health care providers. The graphs present the data in various ways to complete the picture of data being analyzed.My only concern is that since using this device, my pressure reads normal. I take readings multiple times during the day (i.e. morning, day, evening, or night). Upon having my pressure read at a club sponsored health fair, my pressure was indicative of a hypertensive person. I had a second reading done by another technician at the same event with a similar device as this monitor and it too recorded a comparable hypertensive reading. This makes me want to verify accuracy of the device."
4,meter,the only thing i don't care for is the cuff. i would rather have the soft cuff as it is much easer to put on either arm
4,Omron HEM 790IT BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR,Everyone in the family is using it . Easy to us .Only 1 problem I can see NOT MADE IN THE USA !
5,Great Product,"I purchased an Omron brand BP monitor on the recommendation of my physician. He told me that I should be able to get a good monitor for around $50.00 - $100.00. Based on his recomendation I started shopping around and found the Omron HEM-790IT at a great price on Amazon and had the unit within a few days. I probably didn't need the IT but I liked the idea of being able to track my BP over a long period of time without a lot of hassle and the software is great. Allows you to track 2 people over a long period of time and also allows for ""guest"" readings. I admit that when I ordered the unit I was skeptical about how efficiently the unit would inflate and perform. Boy was I surprised! The unit inflates and reads BP extremely fast. The unit is easy to use and the tracking options are great. The readings have proven to be very consistant and accurate for both me and my wife. No more going and sitting at the pharmacy with all of the distractions. Thanks Amazon!"
5,Omron HEM-790IT blood pressure monitor,This monitor works great. I am able to easily print out and save my blood pressure readings using the Health Management Software. It is much easier than manually going through a months worth of readings and writing them down for my doctor.
1,It failed for me on the most important thing - accuracy,"At my doctor's suggestion I purchased and used the device for weeks recording what appeared to be consistently high blood pressures seemingly indicating that a new blood pressure medicine was not working effectively. I went to my doctor three times to verify the issue and each of three times with different cuffs and once side by side with this unit, the unit was consistently 10 psi off on the high side. I have tried a few auto-inflate units on the market and found each of them to be less accurate than manual inflate with auditory monitoring.I believe it is because large males (full size not obese)may require larger cuffs than come with these units. They may work well for smaller people but possibly not for someone my size.The software and electronics were great. But inaccurate reading lead to pretty but inaccurate records and graphs.I'm very disappointed.."
3,"OK, Software could be much better","Many error readings and strange happenings. Very erratic reports of irregular heartbeats (1 in 10-15 readings) but doctor doesn't see a problem. I think the readings might be mostly accurate but, my confidence level in the unit is low. I'm very consistent in my testing setup but I will get a high reading and 5 minutes later it is back to my average range (1 in 8-10 readings) Will work for you if, like me, your interested in average readings and how well your medication is working over time. Software could be much better without much work, indicates manufacture doesn't worry about its reputation or a lack of competition. There is no way to import old data, but allows exporting to excel."
4,Omron HEM790 IT,I have been using the HEM 790IT for five weeks now and I find the 790 is easy to use and the graphs are helpful. The averageing is a benifit to. These gagets help to keep your good health in front of you.Omron HEM-790IT Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with Advanced Omron Health Management Software
4,Great price from Amazon,"I bought this item because of the software program that came with it, to recordand keep track of readings... It also has a 2nd person button for keeping trackof another's readings which works great for my wife. Seems to be accurate which isvery important as my last wrist monitor would give inaccurate readings. I guess thegreatest thing was price as I purchased this much cheaper through Amazon than anyother website or local pharmacy. The two cons are: could use a longer arm cuffhose and secondly, it is quite bulky. You need to pick it up with two hands toavoid maybe dropping it because of it's shape. With a longer hose, one could leavethe unit in one place and not have to move it around."
1,Requires Parallels 4.0 for a Mac,"Update: It now works using Parallels 4.0.Old review: I have Mac computers, able to run Windows XP under Parallels 3. I have not been able to download data from the HEM-790IT over any USB port on a MacPro, a MacBook Pro, or an iMac. I have to find a friend with a PC, and save the file to a CSV file, and then open that file in Excel. I intend to try setting up Windows under Boot Camp, to see whether that solves the problem. So, if you have a Mac, get the cheaper HEM-780 model, unless you really want the data and are willing to jump through some hoops. Otherwise, I would give the machine 5 stars."
2,Low Accuracy and Inconsistent,"This product Omron HEM-790IT only gives you occasionally correct pulse rates, but the blood pressure readings are just unreliable and often inaccurate.I bought this product because this was the top of their line stuff, and now I wonder what the other models would be like.I cross checked the readings of this product several times with my Physician on his manual BP device and found the accuracy of this product to be as low as 43%.This simply means that it just didn't work properly half the time.This product simply doesn't live upto all the tall claims made by the manufacturer and the customer reviews [possibly fudged or doctored] are grossly misleading.Think twice before you buy !!!!"
4,Omron HEM-790IT,"This blood pressure monitor comes with PC software. The software is pretty basic, and also works with the same company's pedometer. The software will not work on a Mac, or on a PC emulator running on a Mac. It will run in Windows running on a Mac Intel machine under bootcamp. I like the device because I can read the numbers easily. Graphing capabilities are non-existent on the machine itself, although you can step back to look at numbers over the prior 7 weeks. All the graphing capabilities are done in the software, which works fine. A nice feature is that you can plug it into the wall, and are not totally dependent on batteries. It comes in a carrying case too."
3,Blood Pressure Machine,"Easy to use but if you have people with big arms, you need to buy the bigger strap. Go for it. Reasonable and easy."
4,So far so good,"I needed a new BP monitor and decided on this one. I really liked the concept of the PC connection (too bad it is only PC - a MAC version would be great.) Great instructions, made well.The cuff is 'stiff' and uses velcro to tighten around your arm but notas 'secure' as the more common cuffs. The molded cuff expands as needed to place on your arm.The LCD size is fine - large and the irregular beat is a nice feature.The data transfer to the PC is very good feature. While keeping a log by typing the data into a spreadsheet is not large task, the OMRON tools make it easy on both Windows XP and Windows Vista (latest Service Packs)."
5,Omron HEM-790IT Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor,"Took this product into physician's office and he took multiple tests afterwhich he gave the Omron a solid endorsement. A prior bp unit did not meet with this approval level. Furthermore, I like that the unit is silent while it takes your pressure. Some units beep as they measure blood pressure adding their own level of anxiety to the process. The Omron unit is consistent and accurate."
5,excellent product!!,"Bought this product based on reviews on-line. Have been very impressed with the quality and recently printed report to take with me to the doctors office. He was very impressed with report. Easy to connect to the computer, does not yet have Mac version. software needs updating but overall I give this product 5 stars. Amazon had best price."
4,poor software,"The machine works very good but the software is not the easyest to use, even my Dr. said he dose not like the chart but it is hard to print out the numerical chart"
2,Not for me,"This may be a very fine blood pressure monitor; however, if I had known that it would pinch and bruise my upper arm when using it, I never would have purchsed it. The cuff is too wide to fit comfortably. Only people with long, thin arms should buy this item."
1,Very Disappointing,"I investigated this device before purchasing and had high hopes for a good product. However, shortly after I got it, it showed error messages and no BP. I returned it and had a 2nd one sent. It showed an error message on the 1st use but gave a BP. I checked all fittings and the instructions & made sure the plastic connector was tightly fitting. On the third use of the device, it showed 3 consecutive error messages & no BP was able to be obtained. I am very disapointed and have requested a refund. Customer service was excellent."
5,Omron Blood Pressure Monitor,This an excellent device to monitor blood pressure. It is easy to use and consistently accurate. The feature that allows one to download the blood pressure data is a real bonus and the printouts can be shared with your physician.
4,Blood Pressure Monitor,This is a good item if you are looking to test your blood pressure often. Only thing is that the arm band is difficult to line up exactly where you want it. Otherwise it is very good and software monitoring is a nice feature.
4,OMRON HEM-790IT,"The product works well; I do have a problem with the software. It does not let you edit to add ""notes"" like medications, exercise etc. When the irregular heartbeat symbol shows in graphs, it does not show in the individual entry of pressure, this is what I take to the Dr. The graphs are impressive if I was taking this to a meeting to impress someone, but this is my life and I want the Dr. to see what the actual readings are with the irregular heartbeat, it does not show up with the individual pressure readings in the PDF format. Must be some 25 y/o programmers with 35 y/o managers approving this stuff. They need someone like a Dr. and or patient that is 50 plus to approve this. I have found software for taking notes online but they go for $30-35, but if you get the regular BP monitor for a cheaper price then get the software that might be better, you just don't have the option to download to your PC."
1,Inaccurate,"I thought I was buying a top of the line blood pressure monitor. It is certainly priced like one. However, my unit was woefully inaccurate. I took it to my doctor and had her nurse do a traditional blood pressure reading. The result: this thing read 25 points too high on the systolic reading and 15 points too high on the diastolic reading. Perhaps I just got a bad unit, but I'll move on to another brand."
2,Consistently inaccurate = fail,"The systolic reading was consistently at least 20 marks too low than what I know it really is. This is true even though I am certain of operating it correctly and taking over 100 readings with it in a 2 week period. Yes, the cuff was correct size. The diastolic reading was correct, though. The reason I bought a monitor is because I know from professional readings that my systolic is too high. But this thing says my BP is very normal. Trusting this thing could kill you. The primary function of a BP monitor is to accurately monitor both systolic and diastolic. So this is fails at functioning and is therefore worthless. All the extra stuff that comes with it is just a gimmick and is not necessary for your health. I doubt I can let myself buy another Omron product. Product returned for full refund. Thanks to Amazon for making it easy to return at no cost to me."
5,Omron HEM-790IT Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor,"Everything about this item was as advertised. Very well-built, and incredibly easy to use. Overall, I rate it highly and I am very pleased with the value."
5,Blood pressure meter review,The product is easy to use and provides all of the features advertised. The software is easy to install and provides good graphs and diagnostic information.
5,Omron HEM-790IT blood pressure monitor,"Excellent product, easy to use. I has no trouble installing the software. I was able to use it right away. Later I learned how to program it to make consecutive readings (thee of them) and then average them out. I think programing is the hardest part as you need to read and follow the booklet instructions. If all you want is to get individual readings, then the machine is ready to use from the get go. I highly recommend this product."
4,Exellent device.,The machine is easy to use and efficient. The software report is a little confusing at first but nothing to cry about. Overall it is a good product.
4,Need more time with it.,"So far my blood pressure has been checking a lot higher than it ever has at the doctor's office, and if this turns out to be reliable I guess I should thank the manufacturer of this product. But I suspect that I need more time with it and possibly take it to the doctor's office with me to figure out the best placement of the band.It's very simple to use. I have not used the software portion yet.Power cord could be longer by about 3-5 feet to be more useful."
5,HEM-790IT BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR,Unit is very easy to use and instruction manual is well written. The software was easy to load but takes time to use and understand. I like the separate user memory and quick check without memory for other user's. Product is well designed and priced well. Good bang for the buck.
3,Great but no ability to delete individual records,"For what it does basically, taking blood pressure, it's great. Easy to use, appears to be very consistent. Five stars.But, the system lacks the ability to allow deletion of individual records through the monitor or the software management. This system allows only deletion of ALL records. I use the ""A"" and ""B"" switch for two people (myself and my spouse). Sometimes, I forget to flip the switch from A to B or from B to A and make a error in recording. From what I can tell, records can only be deleted (or edited) after exporting to a spreadsheet like excel.I like the system charting; morning/evening, daily, weekly and monthly with different screens and even printouts (even pdf). But again with the charts there is no way to delete or edit erroneous individual records for an accurate charting.Over all, three stars."
1,HOW ACCURATE IS IT?,Found it gives variable readings. Brought it to the doctor's office for comparison and both systolic & diastolic readings were high compared to doctor's monitor. Also higher than what the neighborhood Urgent Care Center came up with so had to return it as I thought of it as useless.
1,No good,Returned! Not accurate. Consisitanly high on my pressure and consistantly low on my wife's pressure.
3,Ok when it works,"This blood pressure monitor is very picky about how it is angled before it will work. I have not verified the accuracy of its information either, but it seems to be low: or my blood pressure is way lower than it used to be lol"
3,No software for MAC,"No where on Amazon site can you find out that the included software only works on windows 2000, xp, or vista. If I knew that I would have saved some money and got the next lower model. Used it twice so far and seems ok. Too bad I wasted $20.00 on software I can't use."
2,Omron HEM-790IT Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor,I was severely disappointed with this product. I could never get a correct blood pressure reading because of the way the cuff fit. It is a hard cuff and is difficult to use. I enquired about replacing it with a soft cuff and Omron stated that the hard one is the only available one . It now sits in a dresser drawer unused. It was fairly pricey and I would not recommend it to anyone.
4,great but not perfect,"I love the software with this monitor. Makes everything easy to track. I'm looking forward to taking it to the doctors next week to compare with the readings they get. The only probelm I have is the fact that I can get a +/- of twenty points depending on which arm I use. Will see what the doctor says. It certainly does give you a accurate trend information on morning, versus day, versus evening plus averages and pulse. Definitely worthe the money."
2,need more than two user (A) (B) wish is was for more than two users,"NEED MORE THAN TWO USERS (A), (B) IS NOT ENOUGH OTHER THAN THAT IS GOOD"
3,Omron 711,"On the whole OMRON 711 has very good features. When you take readings, consistency within a short duration is what I would like to see. I have not seen this consistency with this instrument. However, this is what I have heard in general about all blood pressure monitors."
3,Unexceptionally average,Ehhh the BP unit is ok. It has alot of nice features but what good is a a blood pressure machine that isn't accurate 100% of the time? Isn't that the whole purpose of the machine itself?Also the cuff design is defective if your arm is too small (i don't have this problem because I'm jacked diesel but my mother did) then the cuff won't detect your arm right away and will give you infinite errors. A solution to this is squeezing the cuff while it inflates until it gets past 30/40 or so.
1,Recieved a faulty devise,"I bought this for my mother but within the first week, the Omron monitor started registering 30 points higher. This really scared my mother (who already has high blood pressue). She panicked and ended up going to the hospital to find out it was the Omron monitor and not her. Clearly a faulty one, and I returned to amazon. The fauly devise could have a caused her a real heart attack."
3,Digital still not as good as manual,"IT has to test me 3 times in order to be accurate, and the pump stops for errors atleast 25% of the time. Besides those two issues it has worked well."
2,Didn't work for me,"I've been looking for a new blood pressure monitor. I had been usingMark of Fitness MF-81 Wrist Blood Pressure Monitorfor the last year, and while it gave me very steady results, they were always lower than my actual blood pressure reading.After looking over the reviews, I selected this Omron monitor with the software. It never worked for me. The cuff is very comfortable, but I received more error readings than actual readings. When I received readings they were usually about 10 to 20 points lower than my actual pressure. The readings also varied greatly each time I took them.I really wish this unit would have worked. I gave it two stars because I loved the cuff and the idea of the software. I never used the software since I was forced to return the whole thing when I couldn't get an accurate blood pressure reading."
2,Terrible unit - Cuff too big,This unit has received some very good reviews and that is why I bought it but to be frank it is very unreliable and does not work well because of the cuff. My arm is larger than average yet the cuff is too big and poorly designed which results in EE readings and inconsistent readings if you can get it to work. My advice is to avoid this unit.
5,"Feature-rich, but somewhat bulky",Much improved over previous unit I used. Retains readings that can be downloaded to computer. Very handy. I would prefer it be a little smaller.
2,"Machine great - Cuff, a pain to use","I have a smaller version of one of the Omron machines at work that has a cloth cuff and it's very easy to put on. This version has a very good machine that keeps track of pressure readings for 2 people and keeps track of the readings for several days. The problem is the stiff cuff. It is very hard for one person to put the cuff on by themselves. Once you get your arm in the cuff and attempt to pull the remainder of the cuff around to completely close the cuff, the cuff will start moving if you keep pulling. I had always been told you needed to keep the tube coming out of the cuff, close to the bend in your arm and it's so hard to do that when you are pulling the remainder of the cuff around your arm. Once I have put my arm in the stiff part of the cuff, I have to put my arm up against the wall to keep it from moving until I have brought the remainder of the cuff around."
4,Omron HEM-790IT,"The software is a bit more complicated than I expected. But as I learn to use it, it will be great. I beleive that I made a good choice in buying it."
5,omron digital bp cuff,"This product is user friendly and is a good way to track the blood pressure of 2 different people and to be able to print out the results for your doctor. It has an ac adaptor with battery capability. If you are obese, you will need a larger cuff."
4,"Works as expected, no worries.","Everything works as we expected. The printed graphs are nifty. We got the pedometer and the graph with the steps is helpful. We got one for us and one for my 87 year old mother, whose doctor wants her to record readings daily. However, she continues to record the readings manually on a page as she has for a year with a previous Omrom BP product becasue it is not convenient for her to hook up the cable to her computer, which for her is mainly an email machine. Also, the cuff is not large enough for a person with large arms, so the reading is done from the forearm. Otherwise, it's nice to have this machine at home. It is trustworthy. Note that they say it has a 5 year waranty, but tht doesnt apply to the cuff, which they recommend be replaced each year...which is why we just bought a new one."
5,Omron HEM-790IT,This is a great Blood Pressure Monitor. I had Omron products before. They make a quality product. This product works as described. Amazon shippingwas fast. I like having an A/C adapter or batteries for its operation. I gave this product a pretty thorough comparison check with other products on the internet before buying and Amazon had the best prices and Omron HEM-790IT had the best features.Thank You! Amazon and Omron... I'll be seeing you again..
1,irratic readings,"The readings were very inconsistent, so I had to return the item. I owned an older model from this company and it worked very well for many years until it became inoperative."
5,Omron HEM 790IT,Used this unit for few weeks and it works as expected.The log is a nice feature.Nothing sexy about this unit but does what you think it would.
2,Cuff problems,I've owned this for a year and am sick and tired of fighting the preformed cuff. Eight times out of ten I get errors and have to reset the darn cuff and start over. I'm totally fed up. I would never buy another BP monitor with such a cuff. It just shouldn't be such a struggle all the time to take my blood pressure. I bought this model because I liked the idea of downloading the data to my computer. Even that isn't as handy as I thought. Hard to get a print out that's meaningful to my doctor. He'd rather I just wrote the numbers down for a couple of weeks and brought those in.
4,Works as intended,So far all has worked well. Software loads up and works fine on Windows 7 for me. The unit works with a charge to let me do readings without being plugged in the wall. I do wish we could remove individual incorrect entries easier.
4,have no problems,bought this monitor to replace with old. I like the software it makes keeping track of trends easy. A check with the doctor's office this unit is spot on. good bp monitor.
2,This monitor will raise your blood pressure,"While the price and features are great on paper, in practice something doesn't work right. 50% of measurements are aborted by an error message, and never reach full cuff inflation. That is exteremely annoying. Unit is sent back for refund, and as much as I wanted to stick with Omron, I have ordered a different vendor instead."
4,HEM 790IT,The Omron HEM 790IT is one of the best Blood Pressure Monitor. It is easy and works right out of the box. I will recommend it to any one. The price was great at Amazon.com.
4,Great product,Very good product and very accurate. Easy to use and fast shipping. size is very convenient. The only small issue is the software to connect with computer. It's not the best but works.
4,A good BP system with an adequate software link,"Liked the quality of the blood pressure unit and cuff comfort. The system is limited to holding 34 determinations though. You download BP and Pulse information to your computer. It stores the new information. You can then print plots of your BP, pulse over time. The software accumulates BP information so you do not seem to be limited to 34 determinations. Can hold data for two patients and the software plots the data for each user. Good price - adequate software."
4,Blood Pressure Machine,"The machine arrived in excellent, new condition. The machine is easy to use, but seems to be reading a little high."
2,check before you click,"This is a beautiful book, however I did not scroll all the way down to see that it was printed in German. I have returned it for an English version."
2,Intricately carved lions with string tails?,"This book is quite inspirational for the art work ,but it fails as an instructional work .I doubt if Mr Bridgewater has ever ring turned wooden animals! One would need years almost to complete an ark he describes .For example the intricate carving on the back of the crocodile .The very essence of this type of toymaking was a few clean cuts of the knife ,cleverly creating an animal with the least effort .with no sanding whatsoever .I think a novice would be put off carving and turning for quite some time if he/she attempted to ring turn and carve by this instruction .To sum up I cant help thinking that the Bridgewaters are very cleverly milking sources with no practical input of their own .I dont believe they are woodcarvers in their own right"
2,pretty dry,The book was in good shape. But the contents were not written in an interesting manner. Not a book to just pick up and read. Will just use it to look up certain things and read about them.
3,Interesting Book,"?,Why does this guy try to discredit the Nation of Islam andblack america in general,when it comes to what has beenhappening to black america all these year's,under the racistgoverment.How come he did not include the cia,kkkrackcocaine genocide plan that they have denied to this day."
4,Excellent game,"I am a major Zelda fan, so I figured I would have to wait until a new Zelda came out before I could enjoy another game. We got Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy at Christmas, and it was very very good. It plays very similar to the Zelda games. It has great puzzles, the monsters are easy to fight (though some might find this a drawback), the graphics are great, and the story was fun. Also going back and forth between the two characters (Sphinx and the mummy - Tut) was very interesting. If you love Zelda, you will certainly enjoy Sphinx while you are waiting for a new game to come out. My only trouble now is I have to wait for a new Zelda and a new Sphinx."
5,I love this game,"This is one of my all-time favorite games. It's got a cool mix of monster battling and platforming, all in an awesome-looking acient Egypt setting. If you like Prince of Persia, Sands of Time or Beyond Good and Evil, you'll really like this game. I highly recommend it (my only gripe is that apparently no sequel will be coming)."
4,Entertaining Adventure Game,"This is a solid, entertaining adventure game. Like most everyone else who wrote a review, it strongly reminds me of Zelda. The story is fun and entertaining, the graphics are great, and it has provided me with hours and hours of entertainment. My only complaint though: I wish there were more save points - they are few and far between and that can lead lots of frustration."
4,Save issues - but still fun,"Actually just a word of advice... I have been playing this game for awhile (I am not a hardcore gamer and only occasionally have time to play), but I must agree on the save issue and make an addition... 9 hours into the game - having completed the mummy portion where I get the atun statue - I then was killed as Sphinx. Am back to save point with the mummy - but the door is closed and locked and I can't get through... must now start at beginning again. Moral of the story... find the stupid statue and save all progress no matter how far you must walk to get to it...So sad... other than that - it's a pretty cool game..."
1,Flimsy and overpriced,"An absolutely terrible product. I got suckered in to buying one of those creme brulee sets, where the ramekins were too small and the torch inadequate. The ignition mechanism is extremely flimsy and mine broke after one use. It is also overpriced. You will get much more use out of a burnz-o-matic torch that attaches to a mini fuel tank and for about the same price."
1,This gun is junk.,"This gun is junk. Tried removing the brass nozzle, and when I finally got it unthreaded, there was some kind of crust inside, like it was sealed closed. How can you have an spraygun that you can't remove the nozzle? Also, you can't remove the needle. Tired removing the needle, the back screw is part of the needle, tried backing it out all the way, twisted the needle in half. This gun isn't worth a penny...."
4,Camco RV 25' PowerGrip Powercord,Heavy duty with handles and 10-guage wire. Best price through Amazon Warehouse Deals. Mine came without the carry strap (listed in product features)...maybe because it was a return and then resold through Warehouse Deals? So I knocked off 1 star.On the plus side....I'm suprised nobody has mentioned the green power light indicating a positive connection on the male plug. This is small but significant feature not found on other cords - especially when you pull into a campground late at night and you plug into a rusty old outlet box - you can be assured...its powered-up!
3,Large plug does not fit some RV outlets,"quality seems ok, but was not able to use this summer because the large yellow male plug did not fit inside the weather cover of the outlet at the RV park. Therefore it was useless to me. I will now need to cut off the plug and and refit the cord with the traditional round plug which fits all RV parks."
4,Off and running,"With the magnatude of menu settings available for the Olympus Camedia C-700 Ultra Zoom I needed a reference book to help give me insight into the camera and the thinking that went into its design and features.This book provided that information and more. In doing so, I've been able to experiment and get more out of the camera then I expected when I purchased it.If you own the Olympus C-700 Ultra Zoom - this is a must have resource."
3,Product has changed in recent years,"I use to love this Knorr sauce. In fact, many years ago I worked in a restaurant where we exclusively used the Knorr Hollandaise sauce for Eggs Benedict. Regular customers would occasionally ask for ""the recipe"". If they only knew!A few years ago, my wife and I both noticed that Knorr must have changed something with this packaged sauce. The flavor is now fairly bland as compared the way this product use to be. Thinking it was a batch that had been incorrectly mixed, we purchased it a handful of times over the last fews years. We've come to the conclusion that this is the way it's now being made. As such, I'm looking for a better packaged Hollandaise mix. What a shame."
5,"easy, but great flavor!","This has been a family favorite for many years- it's excellent on eggs benedict! Just top a toasted english muffin with a slice of candian bacon or a strip of bacon broken in half, a poached egg and dribble this sauce over top- voila! This sauce mix stores well in small spaces,& is always on hand for last minute extra ooomph! to a variety of dishes. Knorr changed the recipe a few years back to make it a little more heart-friendly (it used to call for a whole stick of butter and 1/4c less milk. If you want to be really decadent- go ahead!) For added flavor, I recommend squeezing the juice of 1/4 of a lemon into the sauce right before serving."
4,If you like thirties jazz. . .,"I first met Coon-Sanders in the seventies, a friend had an album called ""Radio's Aces"" featuring the Nighthawks Band.I was very pleased when I saw the revival transcriptions on Amazon. I bought two of the re-recorded from 78rpm offerings immediately, and now have got this, much bigger, selection. The quality is as good as any of these discs, reclaimed from old records as they are, and fills in the gaps, so to speak, in my collectiion of these wonderful songs. I was glad when [...] seemed to know what I wanted when I began a ""Coon-Sanders"" station there. Happy days!"
1,NEW SEEKERS,THEY DON'T EVEN COME CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL SEEKERS. THE ORIGINAL GROUP MAY NOT BE AS GOOD LOOKING AS THIS GROUP BUT IT HAS BEEN PROVEN TIME AND AGAIN THAT THE NOT SO GOOD LOOKING ONES ARE THE MUCH BETTER SINGERS.
5,jewel quest solitaire,"this game is very exciting. it is fun and will keep you up all times of the nights, once you get started you are hooked. the only drawback is that sometimes the game will get stuck in the middle while youre playing."
2,not pleased,"I like the game, but the thing keeps crashing and causing me to do a hard start on my computer, so even though I find the game very enjoyable, I have uninstalled the game because it constantly crashes my computer. So the gaming is good, but the way it works leaves much to be desired............"
1,Crash is not what I had in mind,"The game is an interesting version of solitaire and I enjoyed following the story until it crashed during play in the second book. I uninstalled and reinstalled, but had the same problem. A game which cannot be finished is not amusing. Apparently, this problem is not unknown for this game from what I have read on the Internet. Wish I had read those comments before purchase."
3,I-Ninja:3 stars,"The 20 levels or so of this game plus the visit to the moon and seeing 5 different worlds could have been exciting, are even memorable at least. The giant bugs, playing spitting dobbermen and air borne strikes, surface running, could have been interesting or maybe even challenging. The sound..... well-, maybe it would have been better if they ripped off some other game's music while they were at it to help ease the pain of playing. The visuals are really quite kiddy, although some parts looked clean. There's nothing much found here."
1,Rip off,"I gotta get this off my chest. I've been following theNinjai series (The original little Ninja) for a long time now. When I saw the name I Ninja I immediatley thought of Ninjai. So curiousity killed the cat, I bought the game. It was ok. But as I played the game it was a complete rip off of Ninjai and a cheap imitation at that. I am planning to return it because I don't want my money supporting rip offs."
1,no skill needed,"If you want to waste some money and bore yourself stupid, get I-Ninja. I thought it would be a great challenge with meaningful insights. Instead I found the humor terse and the skill level, well there was none. There is much better out there."
2,Generic platformer,"This is a very generic platformer that follows the formula of Super Mario 64, but is no where as fun as any of the 3D Mario platformers. Each level/stage has to be played 3+ times to get the tokens/coins/etc. needed to move on to the next level. The game play is very repetitive and I got bored after the first world, by the second to last world I quit playing and traded it in."
4,incredible,This has everything you want in an adventure game. I was really surprised how many reviews said how short it was because theres so much you can do in it. Its basically the ninja version of mario64. Its a must play. Its a shame there probably wont be a sequal.
4,"Probably best for a rental, if you're not really into it","This game features a hyperactive ninja with 3d action ala super mario 64, though there are some elements similar to sonic, such as his ability to run really fast, given the right setting. There are also nifty bonus stages that feature him rolling down slides to collect coins. The music is synthesized techno, somewhat memorable. If you like hyper ninjas and diverse levels, then get this game."
4,Cool Ninja Game,"I bought I-ninja about three days ago, and I'm near the end!The ninja moves are cool and all but this game is kind of short.The story is quite entertaining and the controls are simple, but sometimes, it is intensely hard.The system is imaginative: you earn grades at the end of each mission wich help to gain new belts, like in karate! To beat each boss you need a higher belt, and to the number of grades you need for each belt increases, so you'll often come back to previous worlds. I'm 12(hey, maybe that's why i'll beat it fast!), and this game is still pretty cool. So, if you're a fan of ninjas, get this game."
2,Joel,"Clearly Joel never met a demon, its not an everyday occurance. But this light hearted aproach put real people in real danger. The key is to be born again,. and baptised and to study Gods ways and his words, Speak the name JESUS over all peoblems. be careful Joel has head knowledge but NO real life experience, he is weak and demons don't even mess with him."
1,Flotec worked great...once.,"I used this pump to empty my hot tub last fall, November 2010. Worked great. Hooked it up today, July 2011, primed with oil as directed and nothing. Lots of noise but no water. Only worked once. Kinda of expensive for one use. Since I only use it twice a year, I am passed the warranty time limit and out of luck. Bummer. I won't buy another one."
2,Impeller burns out - $30 replacement,This works ok and emptied my crawl space. I've run it for about 40 hours and the impleller has burnt out (you'll smell it one day). The impeller is rubber and when not lubricated as per instructions (I did not) there is enough friction before priming to cause heat and wear. I guess it was a matter of time. I will give this thing another chance with a new impeller and use vegetable oil to lube it before use (crazy I know)! I think it will be ok once primed but until them it's just rubber wearing against plastic. So lube it!
2,"This is about building a house, not the Mayans","I was assigned this book for a class on Mayan Culture and Civilization, so that certainly impacted the lens through which I read this book. I was expecting a book on the Mayans, and that's not at all what this is. It's really a book about buying property and building a house in Mexico - if that's what you're looking for, great. If you want to learn about the Mayans, don't waste your time with this one.I still only gave this two stars because I felt the writing could have been a lot better."
3,A litany of headaches,"This story is like a good number of others detailing the ins & outs of dreaming of life in a distant land, in this case the Yucatan area of Mexico. About halfway through, I lost interest and stopped reading. This wasn't because of it being poorly written necessarily, but just the lack of originality in the concept. It might have been more interesting to me if it had been in a part of Mexico I like better."
1,Seriously slow.,I bought it a while ago and installed in in my IBM thinkpad X22. It is really slow (even slower than modem) unlike other wireless card. The only reason I chose this one is appearance cause it doesn't stick out like PCMCI card. I had no choice but to buy another PCMCI card.
4,Carry on Mr.Bowdich,This book is about a mans life as a sailer. His mom passed away when he was a child. His sister passed away when he was in teen age. He had always dreamed of being a sailer for his whole life. Then one day he was invited on a ship. He cepted traveling on ships for shiping things for a while until his 30s. Then he started sailing some more ships. You will have to read to see what halpens.
4,Biased Opinions,"This is wonderfully written and easy to read for anyone familiar with art history and its lexicon. However, I would not recommend this book to a beginning art history student not familiar with the problems associated with earlier art historians (even modern art historians should be considered carefully). Wofflin is rather biased on the part of the High Renaissance artists and he does not look upon other artists immediately before or after very fairly. Wofflin does very successfully capture the High Renaissance and its style in this book. Read carefully, this is a must read for any student of art history."
5,perfect fit,well built worked perfect received in timely matter can't wait to hit the road and enjoy it first time camper
5,Solid Connector,This is a heavy duty connector. It replaces a cheap one that shattered when I pulled it apart. I'm sure this one will last and the handle on the 30 amp side is a plus.
3,"Book on early Buddhism, shouldn't claim to be more","This book presents the history, literature, art, and so on of early Buddhism. The author tries to show further developments (after Sri Lankan history) and gets caught up in his prejudices. Mahayana is a ""far cry"" from original Buddhism, Vajrayana is magical sex rites, with ""killing as a religious experience"", without any ethical foundation, etc. If this is academic research, then good night for the academic world. There are no references for these passages given by the author and the only book in the bibliography to this subject is from 1938. Let's hope that the Theravada information comes closer to the historical truth- if such thing exists."
5,Awesome,I love this movie...Verry funy! I like that it was fullscreen! good movie for the whole familyI think....I give it a 5 star I highly recommend it!
4,Love Don't Cost a Thing (Full Screen Edition),"Highschool loser (Cannon) pays a cheerleader (Milian) to pose as his girlfriend so he can be considered cool. Steve Harvey did well to bring his own brand of humour to the movie. I liked it. It was nothing special, but I liked it. It has a good story about issues that most teens deal with everyday. And it is funny."
2,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I thought this movie was pretty bad. Firstly, because I do not have an appreciation for Nick Cannon's work. I think he is a very corny actor, rapper, whatever. I don't know any remakes that are as good as the original, but this one was bad. I only went to see it b/c I was outnumbered by my friends (I'm mad about my $6). Anyways, the 80s version is multiple times better.I'm so glad that the original is on Oxygen's favorite movie list."
1,grand larceny,"a pox on the producers and director for ""making"" this film.it's a scene for scene rip-off of Can't Buy Me Love. A great movie that was actually original.I can't believe this got through the studio execs. no wait, I take that back. A pox on them too."
4,Very Good...Family Movie...,"This was a good movie, and clean. I thoroughly enjoyed it and it had a good message and the unfolding of the story was well done. Real situations and good for the family to watch. Enjoyable!!"
4,Good Movie,"Very Funny Movie Nick CAnnon , Steve Harvey Acting Very stupid , Nick Cannon getting used to the new life that comes down. Chritina Millian Was very great for the part she plays she's more envoloved in this movie than celebrityfemale that plays in Movies these days."
3,"Bad remake, but good film!","I have to say if you ever saw the movie Can't buy me love, then you pretty much know what it's about. I just have to say that when it comes to the facts of a remake this one is way low on my scale. I mean the guy pays the girl 1500 hundred dollars plus labor for two weeks of being popular. In the other film it was only a thousand dollars, and a month's worth of being popular. The only parts I liked was that it was funny, but it definitely was not a true remake. Good potential overall, worth a rental at best, I wouldn't buy it though!"
2,Don't waste your time,"Love may not cost a thing, but this movie does and its not worth it. The male character goes from erkel to puff doody overnight and is never likeable. Why the hot chick goes for him after all the stupid stuff he pulls is beyond comprehension. Stereotypes abound in this movie and none of them add anything to the humorless wreck. At the end I felt sorry for the nice selfless cheerleader (one non-stereotype anyway) who ends up with the goofy jerk in the end."
3,A good remake of Can't buy me LOVE!!!!,"If you seen the original Cant buy me love then you should know what to expect.Nick Cannon plays as Alvin whos a outsider and wants to become populuar with the rest of the cool kidsChristina Milian who plays Paris is the hottest girl at the school,rich,sexy,hot man im about to break a sweat!!She crash her mom car and Alvin pays for the cost but in one condition that she pretends to be his girl for 2 weeks.Overal the movie is very good I like it alot and it teaches you alot especially being yourself.Overal just buy it you wont be disapointted."
4,great movie,"love don't cost a thing is a great remake of the original. that has better visuals, hot girls, and is very funny. so any fans that love comedies should like this movie."
3,What it Could have been...,"This Remake, like most remakes, did not live up to its original. The original movie, Can't Buy Me Love was much better filmwise and the acting was better than Love Don't Cost a Thing. In trying to update the movie they took away some details that would have made the movie flow more easily and connect scene to scene. If you really want to see a movie with better acting, better directing and better storyline that even includes a message that is sent to the audience in a very interesting way the skip this flick and rent the first one!"
1,worst camera controls,"why has every spawn game sucked? Poor camera control, i had very high hopes forthis tittle, but the developers failed to deliver on the camera control its frustrating to watch the camera glitch out and spin out of control every time yourback is to a wall, you cant see whats around you. the graphics arent as good as theycould be. over all this game sucks and im a big spawn fan."
4,Classic Spawn.,"I rented spawn with true crime and it was o.k. You get to use guns,your chains,your agoney axe,glid with your cape and use your hell powers.spawn is my favoite comic super hero,but this game isn't as great as it seems."
5,Creativity returns to rock,"Buy this record. Unless thick, heavy guitars turn you off (and judging by how many mediocre bands with heavy guitars have gone platinum in the past couple of years, they don't) this record will change the way you listen to music. Yes, the music literally makes you think. Think about what? you may ask. Well, think about music, mostly. This is truly a band's band, and it shows in the tempo changes, the off-kilter time signatures and the unusual jazzy compositions on the second half of the disc. Buyer beware! This is not Creed, or Days of The New, or even Stone Temple Pilots. This is music that took more than thirty seconds to write. This is music that has a life beyond verse-chorus-verse. This is music for evolution. Grow thumbs and pick up this record."
5,Garage Band Perfection,"What kind of album starts out great and just keeps getting more amazing until the very end?I couldn't think of Many until this one came out. Oh, and did I mention the amazing instrumental work, Both Powerful and totally fulfilling...a great combination from 3 of the most talented musicians on the East coast.I honestly believe that this is one of the most underrated, overlooked albums in the history of Acid Rock, and Rock and Roll period. It's sad that because it missed the wave of Good Hard Rock, it will never even be heard by most people.Every time I play this album, people ask who these guys are, thinking that this is a Great album from the early 70's that they never had a chance to hear.With an Awesome East-coast sound, and Some of the wittiest blues guitar I have EVER heard (yes, ever), this album will tie your brain into knots trying to take it all in at once.***Note: BEST TAKEN WITH A FATTIE AT BEDTIME (-:"
4,Very Hungry Caterpillar Plush,"This toy pairs nicely with the board book. It is small, a good size for toddler hands. It's about 7 1/2"" long, about the same length as the board book. We just love the story and give it as baby gifts from our kids regularily. It was nice to have another little item to complete our theme."
3,from a kindergarten teacher,"I purchased this toy to put in my kindergarten reading center, I was a little disappointed with the size but I probably didn't pay close attention to the description. We have several ""reading buddies"" but this was the first one from the book ""The Very Hungry Caterpillar"". I have since found the larger one at another store and the kids love it. It has sparked a new interest in the book and the kids like to read to their new reading buddies."
3,Hungry Caterpillar plush toy,"This product was what I thought it would be, albeit a little smaller than expected.Delivery time was well in advance of what was quoted.Happy with item."
1,What is this crap,This is one of the worse wrestling games I have ever played. Look at the graphics. The blood looks so stupid. Im sorry to say this but all wrestlemania games stink. wwe smackdown 5 is 100 times better than this crap.
2,wrestlemania xix,Wrestlemania is a good game but not as good as smackdown 5 it has a echamber it has bra and panities it has better graphic it has better entrance then any other game wrestlemania is better then raw 2 but when smackdown 5 comes out it will be the best wrestling game ever.
4,The best new wrestling game!!!!!!!,"Raw and Smackdown don't have a chance of beating this all new Wrestlemania game. All new superstars, a new story mode, and with enhanced features, Wrestlemania XIX is going to be a force to be reckoned with."
4,Not too bad.,"I just recieved Wrestlemania XIX yesterday and I can say that it's not too bad.THQ still needs to do a lot of work to get this to the level of the still revered N64 WWF No Mercy.But it's enjoyable to play and challenging. I matched up Lita Vs The Undertaker and just like in a real match, The Undertaker [defeated me].The tutorial is also great. Highly recommended that you use it first so you know how the controller scheme works."
5,The best Damn wrestling game Ever,"For those of you who say this game sucks boy are you wrong its the only wrestling game of its kind:weak and strong grapples,The ability to trash vinces property,and my personal favorite:BLOOD. You see people what you dint understand is that this game makes WWE game history, the first WWE game this generation to contain blood. And for those of you who dont have wrestlers that are your favorites in this game the Create a Wrestler option will allow you to create one of the most detailed created wrestlers ever. (ive always wanted to say this) AND THATS THE BOTTOM LINE 'CAUSE STONE COLD SAID SO!!"
2,this is no smackdown,"the only reason i even bought this game was because smackdown here comes the pain had not been released yet and i just wanted to play a new wrestling. this game is really bad. no season mode and the wrestlers don't wear the championship belts to the ring. you can't even defend titles. besides that, the only titles on the game are wwe,world,and both sets of tag titles. this game is just horrible. the only cool thing is the blood. this game can't even compare to last years smackdown let alone the new one."
4,Wreslemania 19 is gonna be the best,"Wreslemania 19 is supposed to be the best ever. X8 was ok, but i cant wait for the new story mode. Its gonna rock! Im gonna try to preorder it becuz its gonna go out of stock fast."
4,I love this game!,"I bought this game just the other day and the first time that I played it, I was hooked on it. There are several match types that are just awsome. The graphics look real just like the show and you can play in different arenas such as Raw, Smackdown, Velocity, and heat! If I were you, I would buy this game right now. Also, bt the way, dont forget to miss RAW (Mondays 9/8c on Spike tv) and smackdown (thursdays 8/7c only on UPN).what are you waiting for. Dont read the other reviews or anything else! hit the Add to Cart button at teh top of the screen! Go on now!hit the add to cart button. Mark my word. Good Game!"
4,"Horrible, frustrating game-don't buy it, rent it if u must!","Hey yo! This game is by far the worst wrestling game made & I have played them all. If u are simply looking for Exhibition Matches vs. each other this is your game. And can someone please put Kane's new music on a game..the man gets no respect! If you're looking to do story mode & battle for titles which is the point of these games, don't waste your energy. Someone should sit Vince down & make him play these games & ask the man what was he thinking... & then give him a chokeslam. You have to play very hard stages in a harbor, a mall, & other stupid places getting triple teamed constantly never being able to complete the mission or pull off one move & never ever getting to actually wrestle in the ring for the title. Very very very frustrating. I recommend PS2 Smackdown games. And that's the bottom line....."

5,Wrestlemania X9,I have been a real big wrestling fan for a while. I saw the screenshots and they look better than any game.They look like real life.I have a lot of wrestling games and this one will outdo them all. They full size hell in a cell.They have newer wrestlers like Brock Lesnar and Rey Mysterio. They bust open after fighting for a while. You can go backstage and everywhere. Youcan fight with stage police. They have evey last detail of all the wrestlers.this is definately the best wrestling game ever
4,Not bad but could be better,"Wrestlemania X8 was the first game I got for my gamceube,and when I found out about XIX,I had to run out and buy it.I did and I still thought that this game still had some bugs to it.Most of the entrances are better,and the graphics are slightly better (depends on who you are really),and I like the fact that you can focus on a certain part to hurt your opponent more.However there's a few quirks to this game.The create-mode could've been better.Same problem with X8.Unlike X8,XIX had a story mode.Unfortunatley is sucked.What were the makers at Yukes thinking about.You don't wrestle in this mode.All you do is take out security and construction workers.This is called revenge mode,and it is HARD!But the hours,and hours of just wresting in exhibition make up for it.If you own a gamecube and love wrestling,than Wrestlemania XIX is what your looking for.Let's just hope that the next wrestling game for gamecube will have some major improvements."
3,No Mercy is still KING!!,"clearly a lot of work has gone in to this game, its almost as if they started out to please No Mercy fans but along the way reverted to their old kiddy Arcade style again. the game runs to fast and although the grappling system and reversals works similar to NoMercy, it fails to come close to matching it, a message even comes up to tell u when to press the reversal button!The only game to truly use the NoMercy engine was DefJam, but that was an EA game so enough of that.I did find a petition at petition online for AKI to joine back with THQ, you can check it out http://www.petitiononline.com/NoMercy2/petition.htmlStill a good game and you can have some fun in the 2 player mode, ohhh and blood is back in the game, FINALLY."
2,where's the fun,hello i got this game last week and i thought i would tell everyone what i think about it ok #1 its boring #2 the revenge mode only took a hour to finish #3 the graphics are the worst i've ever seen from thq i mean damn .... they made stephanie mcmahon look like a transvestite if you want my opion don't waste your money on this game
2,Big toy!,This monstrosity of a toy is way too big and too hard for a baby!My baby keep dropping it on her face.Luckily there were no bruises!
1,"""The same message repeated 10,000 times.""","I was very disappointed with this book. The premise is very strong - 20% of your efforts produce 80% of your results and 80% of your efforts produce 20% of your results so focus on the most important 20%. Rather than buying the book simply repeat that 10,000 times and you get the exact same experience. Sure the book points out that 20% of your customers produce 80% of your sales and probably your problems but the book comes up very short on practical ways of using the 20/80 principle. Covey's First Things First is more practical and more succinct on the subject. Save your money for another book."
3,Good attempt,A decent attempt at expounding on Pareto's law. I found only 35% of the book immediately applicable. Good for the cost used.
4,Great book,"Great book. Everyone should read this book. You won't regret it. And, everyone already read it -- so if you want to know what others are talking about when they say 80/20 principle, you have to read this book."
3,Good concept. Book needs to abide by it.,"I could read the title and just think about it for a while, and change my life.So why an entire book?Also, a lot of his suggestions on happiness and relationships, though they may be true, are not really relevant to the theme of the book (unless I missed something)."
3,Great read for personal and professional development,"I'm actually still reading this book, but I am already learning so much about myself as it's helping me really re-evaluate different aspects of my life to assess what truly makes me happy. Now I just need to figure how to do more of what makes me happy while doing less of what makes me money without sacrificing the income...first learned about the 80/20 principle from Tim Ferris' book 4 Hour WorkweekThe 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich (Expanded and Updated). It's an interesting concept I think every aspiring entrepreneur should try to learn, grasp or be familiar with."
3,It's really not up to date,Not so interesting to read. It seems like it's old concept. We're all know that our nature is under exp() function. Some business advises to analyse more are pretty interesting but only in dynamics. It actually doesn't work with friends and family.
3,Creative,"Anything in your life can be addressed using the 80/20 principle. If you work with projects, for instance, 20% of them bring you 80% of your income (or your problems). If you are trying to address people to buy your products/services, well focus on 20% of them, because they will buy 80% of your portfolio. And by the way,20% of it is really profitable. The issue is: how to read data and transform it in useful information."
4,"I liked this book so much, I only read 20%","Of course, I still had to pay the full price. The 80/20 principle is practical and can be powerful. Koch gives interesting and effective examples of application."
4,More With Less,"Richard Koch presents a compelling argument to do more with less. By focusing on the 20% that produces 80% (give or take) of the rewards in our lives, we can reduce and eliminate much of the marginally productive busy work that occurs in so much of our lives. Koch has many good points to make about how to live simpler with more satisfaction. While the points he makes are excellent, he becomes repetitious. Nonetheless, he gives many great suggestions about how to live better and follow our dreams."
4,A Solid Principle and a Solid Explanation,"There are few self help/achievement books covering only a single topic that provide as in depth an analysis as the 80/20 Principal. Koch does an admirable job explaining the principle from many perspectives, providing convincing rational regarding the impact of the 80/20 principle and its ensuing significance.The 80/20 principle is not overly complicated; however, it has profound affects substantiated by numerous samples and situations. Knowing that the majority of results come from the minority of causes is merely the beginning; identifying those causes in every area of your life and making adjustments to take advantage of this principle is the genuine message offered in the book.Koch also provides as a bonus a chapter on negotiation describing in detail the implications of the 80/20 principal. True to his message, 80% of the value in this book is found among 20% of its pages...happy hunting."
1,NO WONDER ITS THE ONLY BOOK ON 80/20 EVER WRITTEN,"INTERESTING CONCEPT, TEDIOUSLY REPEATED.I suggest readers borrow this book from a public library and take Richard Koch's Oxford tutor's advice (found on Page 25): ""Read the conclusion, then the introduction, then the conclusion again, then dip lightly into any interesting bits.'More than 80 per cent of the value of this book can be found in 20 per cent or fewer of its pages, and absorbed in less than 20 per cent of the time most people would take to read it through.Thus re-confirming the 80/20 Principle.QED"
2,Not as exciting as the title led me to believe.,"""About 20% of the book is useful to 80% of my life! Seriously it has a good thing going for it, but most of it was the same stuff repeated over and over again in different words. I kept saying out loud while reading the book 'Get to the point!"" Guess the book was pretty effective then because I got 80% of the usefulness out of 20% of it."""
3,20% Of It is Good,"This is a reasonably good book on the Pareto (or 80/20) Principle that 20% of the customers, products, etc. produce 80% of the value in a given enterprise.Interestingly, this book seems to follow that pattern. One can read the first chapter or two and the last one and glean virtually everything that is worthwhile in this book. In fact, the author even makes a case for that. He tells about how a tutor he had at Oxford told him to 'never read a book from cover to cover, except for pleasure'. That advice is very good for this book.This principle has been demonstrated to have quite a bit of validity in business. The author tries to generalize this to virtually everything without really backing it up with data or even anecdotal evidence.It is an okay book, but it is less than I had hoped it would be."
3,Nice reading. Could have been shorter,The book is very well aimed at the core of business success as well as at other aspects of non-business activities; personal life for instance.I guess the book could have been shorter though as repetition makes it an easy-reading-on-a-flight.
5,ADDED IMPLICATIONS FOR YOU FROM THE 80/20 PRINCIPLE,"I have always found the 80/20 principle to be a valuable starting point in finding ways to improve performance. What I liked about this book was that it drew out more of the implications of that principle than I had previously thought about. If you are not familiar with the principle, this will be a good introduction. If you are familiar, you should probably stick to the implications. The review of what you know may feel a trifle repetitive. Another suggestion, if you keep repeating your focus on the top 20% in each situation, you will make your results geometrically better (more like 1 percent providing 95 percent). If you know people who are not familiar with the principle who are a bit, perhaps, disorganized, this book would be a good gift. Teach this to your children, and you will increase the likelihood that they will move out when they are grown, because they will be able to afford to."
3,Very mixed feelings,"My feelings about this book are very mixed.What I like about it is that it explains the 80/20 concept and the author shows how it has helped him and he shows some areas in your life and career and company where it might be a useful concept. However, that is also where my discontentment begins.yes, I know that applying the 80/20 concept can be very 'profitable', but exactly how do I determine how to find out which 20% yields 80% of the results?In the end this book gives a good explanation of the concept but utterly fails in teaching you how to discover the 20% that works."
3,I felt the content followed the 5/95 principle...,"This book mentions that the 80/20 principle can be applied anywhere. When applied to extracting important information from books, it means that about 20% of a book say it all. With this book, I had a constant feeling that it said it all in the first several pages. And seeing ""80/20"" mark several times on each page was disconcerting. Another book (Time tactics of very successful people by Griessman) that had arrived stopped my reading of 80/20. I find this new book more insightful and informative already. It also gives credit to the 80/20 principle."
3,beware of consultants who believe this too religiously...,"...because they apply it to their work with clients. I was an internal consultant dealing with consultants from one of the most prestigious strategy firms. They applied the 80/20 rule to their work... and missed the boat. When applied to business strategy and contracts with consultants, make sure you get the full 100%, or even 80%, rather than the 20% they want to give you. Caveat emptor with strategy consultants, folks!"
2,"good concept, but beware of over-application of the concept","Has good concepts when it comes to business, time management but has ideas that brainwashes you to believe in concepts that limit your possibility for happiness and success. Has contradicting ideas in the book.It is an okay book, just gotta pick out the bones from the fishmeat."
2,The 80/20 Principle,"Mr. Koch should have used his own advice when writing this book, that is 20% (I am being generous)was worthy of my attention, with 80% filler of repeating ""80/20"" this and that............ and more word fillers. Of course 50 pages is not too impresive. Be cautious of some of his advice, and mine the true golden nuggets that he does provide if you insist on proceeding further."
2,"Bleak, mostly unrewarding.","Samuel Tyne is a novel with multiple themes, from the cultural conflicts of an African couple settling in an Alberta town, to the blight of dealing with psychotic children. Esi seems to delight in making situations just a little bleaker than they might be in real life: thus Samuel, while working for the Canadian government, has a father-son set of bosses who are bizarre without being in any way humorous. Sometimes the novel is very alive and engrossing, mostly it is bleak and unrewarding. The two most interesting and well drawn characters are secondary characters: the Tyne's white ""friends"" in their small town. Incidentally, there is nothing mysterious about the ending, as a reviewer wrote, it is quite clear who committed the crime."
2,TMI (To Much Information),"This book was to long and drawn out. The author went into way more detail than I needed. The author was to descriptive and use a lot of ""million dollar"" words. The book has lots of slow parts this is not a quick read. Sometimes I would have to read the pages two and three times to make it stick. I found myself bored and daydreaming while reading this book. It was page 235 before the book became a ""page turner"".This was a bookclub selection. The book was a very good discussion book. We really tried to understand every bit of what the author was trying to get over.The ending was not clear who was left standing...it left you to make that decision."
4,"Good cartridge, can start to smear though","This black cartridge goes with my HP Deskjet 694C. I have gone through numerous cartridges and for the most part it prints crystal clear. Some of the only drawbacks comes when its time to print large photographs with a lot of dark colors, as you might expect it uses an aweful lot of ink, especially when you have it on the highest quality settings, and sometimes it doesn't cover completely smooth, but really, most people use printers for text only, and with this cartridge it works great. One bad thing about this might be, when you are getting low on ink, it sometimes has a tendance to smear. Usually this is caused by dust or paper fiber which it has picked up, and it can be cleaned."
2,HP 29,At first it did not work. It did not print. Then it started printing so I kept the cartridge.I do not think it is the same quality I'm used to with a HP 29.Will probably not be getting it again with Amazon.com.
2,black ink HP29,hp29 black ink is on & off in my print out. graph page prints not clear at all. some words also not fully printed on paper. I did clean print head of the cartridge. still the same
5,HP20,"Glad that some had this cartrige on hand, as I love my old HP printer. Prodduct arrived before due date."
3,HP29 INK,"I have found thru many years dealing with HP that the products are always good, reasonable prices, plus always good products.Brought this product thru Amazon.com, I value, trust Amazon to give me great buys, good feedback,and an avenue to return product if I don't like or if defective 0¿0"
4,Made in Japan,"Too bad Amazon doesn't give Country of Origin information. I looked long and hard for a non-Chinese chain hoist and found this Jet (and all of the L-90 series) is actually Japanese manufacture, so purchased one. Will update this review when it arrives."
4,Pearl Quality,"This is the best pedal that I have played in this price range. It has a lot of different options (with the cams and positions of the pedal plate itself). They allow you to get the exact feel that you want, regardless of playing style. It comes stock with a pretty nice beater too which is a plus. a great deal at $120."
2,Old and not enough information,"This book appears to be a good book for beginners and novices on the surface. However, the author often fails to explain much of the potential of a certain object and many times he will explain one type of event and leave you to figure out the rest. I found his book dull, unexciting, and much lacking in depth."
5,"Don't buy this book, rate = 2","I bought this book because of the title and am very disappointed. You do better if you stick to the books from O'Reilly & Associates! My rating is 2 -- please ignore the ""rate = 10"""
2,"Great if you're new to photography, but...","... too much of the book was dedicated to general photographic concepts (exposure, filtration, etc.) rather than specifically large format photography. As I've been shooting 35mm & MF stuff for years, I'm already acquainted with Photography 101 and was looking for a comprehensive reference specifically for LF photography.If you're an experienced photographer looking for a book specifically for LF, consider passing on this one. If you're just getting into photography in general and LF photography in particular, this book would be outstanding!"
1,This game SUCKS!,"I should of listened to the reviews on here. I dont really like games like MEtal Gear Solid and all those Ghost Recon type games because they are just too damn hard for me. I just like shooting and thats what I thought this game was, which it is. The problem is it actually gets pretty hard. There are no check points in any levels so when you die you start all the way back at the beginning and on some levels thats tough because you just barely get by on some parts. Another bad thing is you get killed very easily. Your health drops rediculously fast when someone is shooting you. Also the grenades suck. Everytime I throw a grenade it either lands just a little behind them and doesnt kill them when it explodes or they jump away from it. The first two levels make it seem like an easy game but this game soon becomes a nightmare that I really wish I didnt waste my money on."
3,"OK, needs work","This game was incredible as far as graphics and controls go. The gameplay was strange, because you don't really know what's going on for a while. The story doesn't come clean until near the end of the game. Also, some of the levels were wayyyy to hard. I attempted one level 12 times before I beat it. Come on, I play video games every day, if a rookie played this, he'd give up after his first 5 tries. Finally, the blindfire really isn't that great because the shots miss incredibly and don't have the desired effect of making the enemy scatter. I never knew which grenade was which and you can waste ammo very easily. Don't waste your time on this game, wait for Metal Gear Solid 3."
4,THE BEST SHOOTING GAME OUT THERE,"THIS GAME ROCKS. if you love shooting games like me then this game is for you. This isnt the old runnin and gunnin game. its better. objects(broken down cars,poles,couches) are your only allies. objects in the game will save your life! so you need to take cover, take aim, and take over-kemoz review peace"
3,Demo-Average,Played only the demo and was not too impressed with it. The graphics were good but the controls were a bit difficult. Trying to get the player to do exactly what you want can be difficult; mainly in regards to peering around corners or over boxes. Probably will not buy the game.
4,zack,"when i first saw the cover of this game i knew that it was going to be a outrageous classic. but i was wrong. The replay rate of this game is a 2 on a scale of 1-10 because its so borin that u wont even finish the game before it is over. The arsenal of weapons are minimalbecause there are10 weapons to choose from, yet the only thing that makes them dirrerent are there names. there are also some itemms. a grenade a mini grenade and stickey grenade and a flash bang grenade. the gamplay is good but it is ironic that ever corner u turn is is ALLWAYS somthing to hide behind, which makes it boring. also there is only one type of playibility which is basiclly run'n'gun, which gets broing after a while. the graphics are superb, amazing, outstandily awsome!yet ability to use blindfire in the only cool thing about this game. overall do not buy it."
2,Nice Try,"Kill.Switch looked pretty interesting at first with the take cover and fire blindly moves. This quickly gets boring as you progress through the games. There's hardly any story line if there is one at all and the levels are pretty redundant although the difficulty increases as more guys start shooting at you. The hours of play is also limited as you can go through the game in about 5 hours. There really is no incentive to go back to play the game again. Furthermore, this game lacks a multiplayer system which would have made a little more enjoyable. The sound in the game is pretty good. It has good sound effects as well as an interesting soundtrack. So before you go shell out $40 of your hard earned money, go and rent it."
2,"Killswitch outdone by Duke Nukem 3D, 10 years before","Kill switch is a very basic shooter. It lacks many of the qualities of other Simalerly priced games (Socom 1, Splinter Cell... etc).Had I paid only $25-$30, I wouldn't be so upset. The Phrase 'you get what you pay for', has nothing to do with kill switch. True it has a few nice function features like fairly decent ability to use objects as cover, and the ability to pick up other guns and rounds. But thats where the quality seams to let off. Innovative features are only a good idea if all/most other things are at least comparible to what is allready availible. The game leaves me feeling like i've been had.$50+ games are suppoosed to be of a higher quality the games that you might find for $20-30 range. I'm not aware of Namco's status in the FPS market, but this is very definatly a red herring, and smells very much like a company's first attempt. This game is a study in left out programming."
3,Not for Everyone,"A black-and-white subtitled foreign film with an emphasis on the strange, the weird and the different. Obviously not for everyone. Most useful as a behind the scenes look at life in everyday Yugoslavia before it disintegrated. This film also introduces several retro propaganda clips originally produced in earnest by the Communist regime but now quite comical. The plot itself is something of a mish-mash with little or no linearity."
3,Not what I expected.,"This product does not fit the Timex Data Link USB watch perfectly. It is a generic band designed to fit almost any watch and so the watch has lost it's snug, handsome looks. You see the data link series watch is of a peculiar design where the band is of a unique shape and cut so as to fit the groove of the watch itself. This band, on the other hand, causes that band housing to hang out or protude over the band creating an unattractive appearance. I have therefore relegated it to being worn just for sport and not for work or other show. Mind you, it is clearly a much more durable band than the plastic variety which always breaks (I have been through 3 of those now). But in losing its looks it loses its appeal and so I am obliged to downgrade the score."
3,"fits watch but ""floats"" on a smaller wrist","This strap fits on my watch, but is designed for a bigger wrist than mine. It just dosen't seat well on my wrist. I can get it on just right, but then when I swim with it on, or go for a long run, my arm movements will loosen it and my watch will slide over to where I cannot read it easily. I think this strap would be fine if you have large or normal sized wrists, but mine are small and this is not the band for me. I will shop for another band to fit my favorite workout watch."
3,"Handy, but not so high quality","Though the band is certainly functional, the stitching is not very durable. After wearing my watch with it for only a day, the stitching on the hanging end of the strap started coming loose. It doesn't seem to have affected the function of the band, but I don't know how it will hold up in the long term.As for the pros of this band, it's comfortable and can hold even very large watches - I use it with my Seiko Monster and it seems that the band is big enough to hold a considerably larger watch."
1,Not for larger room,I bought it to replace an old 6000 BTU air conditioner of another brand but this one didn't cool a 300 sq. ft. room as well as my old one did. I returned it and got an 8000 BTU. I bought the mechanical control version of the 6000 but think the digital controls (on my 8000) are worth the extra price on the 6000.
5,Consummately Theresian,"It is easy to see why this book made Fr. Conrad famous when he first wrote it. For all the English-speaking lovers of St. Therese who have seen the footnote ""Dynamique de la confiance,"" it is here in English at last. Traces the development of Therese's way with delicacy, detail, and unflinching attention to chronology; yields a harvest worthy of the care with which it was gathered."
2,Not Easy Read for Me,"The title of the book was what made me decide to order the book as well as the person who translated the book into English (Susan Conroy). St. Therese is one of my favorite saints, so I like to get books about her and try to find books that go into details of her autobiography, Story of a Soul, in order to glean more than what I get when I read her book. This book is more scholarly, a thesis the author is writing and his audience seems to be for other scholarly people. I am not one of them. I like an easy read; relaxing; one I don't have to put too much thought into. My time to read is usually in the evenings, so I need something not too heavy. So, if you are scholarly minded...this is the book for you. If not, I would not recommend it."
1,outdated,"I got this book to read up on breeding snakes, I have a few projects started. Well this book was written in 1988 so it need updating..... save your money"
1,Yes its all CRAP!!,"Anything, Everything by D. Cocteau is AWFUL! Not GAY! No talent. No story. Nothing. Worst ""acting,"" can't even call it acting. No entertainment value! There is no word or words to describe how bad he is at ""movie making."""
4,"Original coverage, but too damn pricey","Mojo, despite its obsession with exhuming Beatles' esoterica, has always been invaluable for its coverage of forgotten corners of music past and present, but it recently went up to $9.50 an issue. For those of us on the blood-selling line and otherwise, best browse it at the newstand and then walk away."
5,essential tool,"the gold standard for the over-40 listener: current bands, historical articles, collector-concious, reliable (if generous) reviews. every issue results in a surprising cd purchase or two. nothing else is comparable."
4,It was great while it lasted....,"I am a big fan of this magazine, but even more so of the ""free"" cd--when it is good, it is very good. So I finally subscribed despite the stiff price. Two issues came, I was happy, then a third without the cd, and then...no more. After many calls and complaints, Amazon finally secured a partial refund--not exactly what I wanted. Here's hoping that the delivery problems can be worked out--maybe an opaque wrapper?"
5,The Best Music Magazine....Ever!,"All established music magazines pale when compared to Mojo. No Uncut, Rolling Stone, Spin, Q, Alternative Press, Filter, are a match for this powerhouse of rock criticism. It's worth the price when you consider this is the magazine your favorite musicians actually read. Where does Jack White of the White Stripes go for some rockin' reading?...Mojo, of course!...It looks at Rock music as a continuum of creative work, not as a list of passing styles and trendy performers, like most rock mags in the U.S. Its slant is decidedly British, but with the pathetic option of having to put up with most american rock crits and their corporate souls, you will be served the best music, bar none. Oh and the free CD's are little treasures!"
2,still waiting,"I know it said ""The first issue should arrive in 12-16 weeks,"" but I don't understand why it should take so long."
2,Somewhat disappointed,"FYI- This is a Brittish rag that is generally superficial in it's take on the music scene. They give brief reviews of numerous new and re-issue CDs like most, but they are highly comercial in their tone and there are more ads than not. They are obsessed with the retrospectoscope, that is they have a fetish with classic British bands (and some american artists). The CDs are a mixed bag: from mostly interesting to worthless drivel. They are almost always current bands doing covers of the British artist they are drooling over this month."
1,Good Machine - When It Works!!!,"This is an easy to use machine and produces great coffee, but there's a big problem with Saeco. We bought one a few months ago, and after 1 month the wiring all burned up inside and we had to return it and wait several weeks for a replacement. Then we used it for another couple of months, and it decided to stop working again. Even this would be all right, but Saeco provides horrible warranty service. First you have to go through a big runaround to get an RMA, then you have to pay for the shipping to them, AND THEN THEY KEEP THE MACHINE FOR TWO MONTHS! I don't know about you, but if I'm paying this kind of money for a coffee machine, I would expect them to turn it around in a few days, not a few weeks. Bottom line - they don't seem to make them to last, and they definitely don't provide the kind of service they should when it breaks."
1,terrible warranty service,Had this machine for 3 months when it started leaking water. Sent the machine back for warranty work and after 7 weeks and numerous phone calls they have finally repaired the broken faucet and are shipping it back to me. For the price you pay for these machines the turnaround on warranty repairs is unacceptably long. I would never buy a Saeco product again.
1,Stay away,"We are on our second unit in just over a year (our first one was shipped 4/13/2007) and they have both suffered the same fate, the perpetual ""Ventilate"" message. It took almost a month to get the first one replaced by Saeco, and its shelf life was less than the original. All told we are less than 300 cups brewed, and we are out of service again. Do yourself a favor, spend your money at Starbucks instead, believe it or not it is cheaper..."
1,Not a durable machine,"While this machine does have some operational flaws and lacks flexibility, I have had it for about two years. However, a series of cascading failures, most likely due to the various leaks in the machine damaging the motherboard, have caused it to become non-functional. After only two years, I am going to have to spend a lot of money and get another system. This super automatic is not designed for durability."
1,not good,lets just say the problems keep mounting. now the screen is half blank so i can't even read the error messages. not cool.
5,Bye bye Starbucks,"Have had this machine for almost a year and done 1000+ cups on it.No problem at all.Just a few important tips:- clean the machine once a week or when the coffee waste drawer is full. You will get a message in the display. Follow the manual for cleanning procedure. Very easy to do.- Do not leave the machine ON all the time if you are not using it.- Never use flavored coffee (like chocolate or vanilla coated beans).- Use good quality whole beans coffee and you will get great coffee EVERY SINGLE TIME.- Use filtered water only. Change the machine filter regularly (see manual).- In the first few times of use, play of the grinding and dosage settings until you find the settings that will give you the coffee taste you like. It is very easy to use it.Highly recommended."
4,"Very cool puzzle solving, but a few small irritations...","Very cool game! Starts very slow, but then grows on you as you go. Lots of puzzle solving, so if this is your thing, you'll probably like this game. Now, the irritating parts about the game: 1. ""Loading, loading, loading..."", numerous, slow loading points between transitions, 2. No autosave, and no way to save at arbitrary points -- many times must exit sub-world and run back to save point..very inconvenient, 3. annoying slow captions rather than voice-over...not a big deal, but would be nice if could either accelerate or skip over dialogue, especially ones you've already seen about 10 times!"
3,Excellent reading. But believable? Sometimes.,"Richard Marcinko is the stereotypical SEAL. I salute his bravery and disregard for his own safety in the face of the enemy. But are we expected to believe all of these escapades are real? I believe the military side of the story, but if there is a larger ego anywhere I'd like to know about it. Marcinko is definitley an excellent warrior, but this would be better reading if he had a better grip on reality."
2,A damaged individual.,"Richard Marcinko's extensive military knowledge is only surpassed by his unfillable ego. The book was interesting to readbut ""Dick's"" skirt chasing, while his wife stayed at home, was disgusting."
4,Awesome!!! If you're into that sort of thing,"Rogue Warrior is an amazing account of the physical and mental toughness of Navy SEALs. I read the book in less than 2 days and was upset when I finished. If you are in the mood for a fast paced, action packed black ops story, this is the book for you.However...If you would like to read an excellent piece of literature, please look some place else. Rogue Warrior is the equivalent of a Danielle Steele novel for men. Dick Marcinko brags incessantly about his military and romantic conquests, which becomes tiresome (no matter how well deserved it is). This is a fun read, no more, no less.WARNING!Steer clear of the other novels in the Rogue Warrior series! Marcinko found success with this edition and simply repeated the formula time and time again. If you continue with the books, it will get old and sour you on Demo Dick."
4,Got as gift,"Excited to read after reading ""No Easy Day"" More stories like this need to be told. People have a right to know what our government is doing to these men and women."
5,"Yeah, coolest book ever.","Rogue Warrior is by far one of the best auto-biographies I have ever read, Commander Richard Marcinko is a hero, and a patriot by any definition of either word. He is the reason our enemies fear us. Once you read this book you will be wondering why our government doesn't have him as the commander of the joint cheifs of staff."
3,"get a grip folks, marcinko started Seal6",It's amazing that people claiming military service up to and including full commander claim Marcinko invented all this and wasn't a founder of ST6. Like the guy or not he made a major CT contribution. That said be glad he's not your son-in-law.
2,Ragu Warrior?,"I started reading this book and it barely held my interest. I kept going hoping it would get better. Then I got to the part when Marcinko starts bragging about his Viet Nam days. He goes out on patrol at night, swims in the dark and kills 4 or 5 Viet Kong. Big [...] deal! A few dead bodies here, a few there... How in the [...] did that make one bit of difference in a war that was a mistake to begin with! This book is a ""me...me...me"" story; I guess if you can get by this Marcinko's ego it is not a ""bad"" read. But there are so many other great books out there, I'd recommend a pass on this one."
1,Don't waste your time!,"After the recent success experienced by Navy Seals Six, I was eager to learn more about them. Unfortunately, I chose the wrong book! This was one of the worst books I have read in recent memory. First, he is by no means a decent author. Second, his foul and abusive language is unneccessary to the telling of the story, even if it is just for ""shock value."" He authors a terribly boring and drawn-out story that should have been told in one-fourth the space. Don't waste your time. I have already done that for so many of you!"
5,This book is 373+ pages of pure tense action!!,"This book, is 100% pure! This is not a fiction, rather an autobiography. Which makes it even more exciting! I read this book from start to finish on a car trip. It is really great because it is a long book. If you like this one, which I guarantee you will, try his other very long hardcovers in the series. If Richard Marcinko ever reads this, what the navy did to you wasn't fair and you are an American hero, not many people can form such an elite counter-terrorist unit as you did, in fact you might be the only one who could. Okay, now since that's out of the way, buy his book, you won't regret it!"
5,"Incredible, this man in a true warrior!!!",This book is action packed from front to back. I like how Marcinko doesn't try and water down the content of the book to much. He leaves to true flavor in it to make all the more exciting.
5,"Marcinko explains combat, SPECWAR and bureaucracy to you","Richard Marcinko, ex-Seal, Vietnam veteran, and iconoclastic self-proclaimed ""Rogue Warrior"" tells about his life in the Navy, his successes, and the failures brought on by hubris -- his and his superiors'. In light of recent world events, it would do us all good to pay attention to what this man has to say about readiness, anti-terrorist tactics, and our ability to counter terrorism at home and abroad."
5,Great story of a Legend.,"This Book is a great book for the readers who love action and want the truth about war. For these of you who dont agree with Politics this and the rest of the Rogue Warrior Series are the book's for you. Richard Marcinko may be the greatest Navy Seal that ever lived, This book describes his training, the war he fought in Vietnam, his tactics, and he also tells How the navy has changed and tried to despose of him. A Great book By A great Navy Seal."
5,In a nutshell....100% TRUTH!,"Not only have I read this book and believe it, I LIVED it. The names were changed for a good reason...To protect those of us that are disabled from the very system that screwed us as they did my former Commander. Believe EVERYTHING in this book, it is all true."
3,Of Men and Egos...,"Interesting book about a former Navy seal. The author talks about what it was like to be a seal, talks a little bit about his Vietnam experience, including a section in which he describes how he killed somebody. The rest of the book is about some counterterrorist unit that he created and commanded, whose purpose was to wreak havoc on the military to determine its readiness. Mr. Marcinko obviously has an enormous ego and he loves relaying how his counterterrorism unit outsmarted the military. The author wrote numerous sequels to this book that were ""fictionalized"" accounts of his experience as a counterterrorism expert. A good read, but obviously not great, because I've never had the desire to read one of his sequels.I will now conclude with my signature hiaku:Richard MarcinkoBig Beard, Big Arms, Bigger EgoCan Seals Really Write?"
5,A Must-Read book if you like Special Forces,"This guy (Marchinko) is THE MAN. He goes all out balls-to-the-wall and the great thing about it is that he's telling it from the real prespective. For me, this book is the closest I've gotten into the head a Special Forces soldier who basically is an icon. ""Rogue Warrior"" is a book that will capture your senses and hold them until you're done with the book. The Marchinko ends leaves you wanting to grab another book in his series and start reading it right away."
5,"You don't have to like it, you just have to do it.","Richard Marcinko pushes his book to the edge of the envelope just like he does with himself and his men. This book actually inspired me to get off my butt, take responsibility for my actions, and just generally get things done. If you are in need of upliftment, read this book"
2,A little too much.,"Where the book dealt with life in the battle zone, it was fascinating. There was less narration of this sort than I expected though, and most of the book dealt with Marcinko's rise through the Navy ranks and his dealings with the Navy bureaucracy. The main trouble I had with enjoying this book were the repeated, overbearing, egotistical remarks Marcinko makes chapter after chapter, page after page. I appreciate that to be a man in his shoes, one needs a huge ego to be successful or even survive, but the constant braggadocio really grated on my nerves. Marcinko is a rare breed and one deserving appreciation from every generation of American. His book though, is one part entertainment and one part irritation."
5,One of the best books I've ever read...,An unparalleled autobiography which reads like a novel. I read nearly 250 pages without setting the book down and finished within 3 days...This man is an incredible soldier. Can not recommend the book highly enough.
4,Good,"Way too sad of an ending. This is the third Marcinko book that I've read. It was pretty good, but the ending was very surprising."
4,Great,"As intense as The Triumph and the Glory, as fast paced as Debt of Honor, as action packed as any of Griffin's fine books, Rogue Warrior is a winner all the way!"
5,the best book i have ever read,richard marcinko is with out a doubt the god of war it seems to me in this world we live in today that we need to exercise the leadership skills that mr. marcinko has. he is a great man and i can only hope he can do a book signing in my area in ohio like columbus or newark. respectfully yours b.tague
5,Marcinko is almost as cool as my brother (a dutch commando).,"Allright man.... This is without a doubt one of the best told stories of barrelchested men with hair on their teeth and havoc on their mind. I 've allready made about seven of my friends addicted to these stories. My brother, a hairy assed commando from the netherlands, made me read rogue warrior and I immediately bought the rest. A no nonsense, funny, informative and testosterone-booster of a read. END"
2,Could have been so much more.,"The author has an amazing story to tell of the time he served in the Vietnam War. However, certain parts of the book, like the part dealing with him verbally thrashing a superior officer, are very much in doubt.That one incident caused some stir, as other books written by members of the SEAL community refute this author's telling of the events that day.With his integrity under question, the rest of the book must be taken with a pinch of salt.But even with that pinch of salt, the book has an amazing story to tell of a dedicated warrior, one of America's truly devoted warriors. Hats off to Mr. Marcinko's service to this country!"
5,Rogue Winner!,"He is forthright, honest, opinionated. He is brave and intelligent. This book is written with a sarcastic sense of humor that blends well with the topic of the Navy SEALs and more importantly, Marcinko's carrer in said field. Frankly, I couldn't put it down."
5,rogue warrior rocks,great book - excellent read if you're into modern warfare / evolution of counter-terrorist activities. written in an engaging manner that mixes small amounts of missions / action with a broader evolution of his career and the military's special forces.
5,"An Incredibly truthful novel, Being A SEAL I recommend it.",This book caught my attention because of the fact that Richard Marcinko is the former Commanding Officer of the SEAL Team I am a Part of. SEAL team two. The emotions portrayed in this autobiography are as real as they seem. The Teams are a bretheren and I think that essence has been captured in this book. Long live the SEALs and Demo Dick. *****
2,Good stories... can't STAND the person,"I started to read this book because a friend recommended it... and I could hardly get through it because of Marcinko's intensely grating personality.Okay, I can stand the cursing every other sentence and the explicit 'tell-it-like-it-is' storytelling, but I could not get over Marcinko's hyper-macho, over-sized, let's-beat-up-people-for-fun ego! I didn't find him enjoyable as a person or as a writer.And maybe it's just me, but it's hard to identify with a guy who believes: ""War was great!"" (p. 92)Maybe in action movies, pal."
4,Mandatory for all in military,"I have read this book several times from front to back and I think it should be mandatory for all in the military or those who are going into the military in the near future, like myself.The war stories are great thrills to read, and the rest of the book gives you great insight into the other aspects of the military, whether you agree with Marcinko's viewpoint or not, and some of the people serving in the military.I give this book 4 stars because while it is a great read, I suspect that Marcinko's experiences and the fog of time might have affected his writing somewhat."
4,hooyah!!! to the Warriors!!!,"This is one book which can take you off your seat.The fact that his expertise on terrorism did not help others realise the fact that we are very vulnerable to the terrorist acts shows thwe naivity of most of the population.It needs Sept.11 and 3000 people dead to make them even make the slightest move .It disgusts me when I read some of the opinions voiced like what would happen if Americans machinegunned Iranians during Desert One when American lives where in stake.It seems to me that to an average American it would be better to let their compatriots die even if taking hostage of an American Embassy is in itself an act of War.Anyway ,however sad the whole situation is lets give a 5 thumbs up for the best fighting force on the planet."
1,Complete Waste,I bought this trash based on favorable reviews on this site. I can't remember reading a book that was so poorly written and so totally without any literary value. In the future I will make sure that I get positive recommendations form other sites before I buy.
3,"As dark as ""She's Come Undone"", but not as well written.","This was a really disturbing story with nothing ""feel good"" about it. In the realm of ""dark"" books, of which I have read many, this is the darkest, with a main character who posesses no redeaming characteristics nor strives to. Her whole life it is clear that she is not loved.I had a hard time reading this author, not only because of the books nature, but because she tends to right in prose and run-ons. Her storytelling style lacks the allure to get me hooked."
1,A disappointment,"I loved the first chapter where young insecure Elizabeth takes such delight in loving and being loved. Then it turned out that Amy Bloom didn't mean it at all. Instead of love inventing anyone, the characters just let love ruin their lives for no good reason at all. Charming Elizabeth has one sordid affair and one high-school romance that doesn't quite work out and then she just gives up completely and sinks in to a slough of despond so boring the novel won't even talk about it. This book turned out to be a disappointment and a cop-out."
2,The title is the best part...,"The title of this book, Love Invents Us, leads you to believe you will be reading a passionate love story, one with obstacles to overcome and triumphs to behold. What I read was pure drivel! I had no sympathy for Elizabeth, who never stepped out of the cycle, who loved the unloveable and continued to exercise meaningless, false relationships throughout her life. Elizabeth was very unhealthy and used, and I had no room to find goodness or sincerity in her. I could barely make it to the end of the 205 pages. Although there were some allusions to the human body that were very well written, there weren't enough of them to redeem this book for me. I'm sorry, but this book belongs in Bad Book Hell."
3,"Incredibly depressing, beautifully written",If it weren't for Amy Bloom's writing skills I wouldn't have finished this book. The story was disturbing and the characters were unrealistic. I had a hard time finding any sympathy or attachment for the main character and most of the subsequent characters. But her prose kept me reading to the end.
3,Didn't like the ending,"We follow Elizabeth Taube on her journey from naive schoolgirl to full-blown woman.We learn how her sexual encounters shaped her life and her personality.Meet Mr. Stone (Max) who was her teacher and who fell deeply in love with her when she was only fourteen.Mrs. Hill, the elderly woman who Liz helped to care for and who became her confidant.Huddie, her black lover, who gets sent away after Liz gets pregnant and suffers a miscarriage.Rachel, on again off again friend. Sentences are often long and jumbled but I like the way she writes.The ending is horribly lame (""If this were just my story, I'd tell you more..."" (Fast read.)"
2,The short stories are better,"I read this novel since I liked the short stories of Bloom.This book is disappointing when compared with the powerful prose of Bloom.The love stories are mildly interesting, the characters develop only partially and overall it leaves one wanting..."
4,WOW!!!NY,"This story was...gripping. It sounds cliche but I couldn't put it down. I was entranced by the life of a small girl, me not wanting her life to be true, but at the same time realizing that this is her life and it doesn't only happen in a book, but in real life also. This story was remarkable, well written and intriguing."
4,A worthwhile read.,"Amy Bloom certainly has an interesting slant on growing up. Her main character goes through some pretty rough stuff, and holds her ground really well. This book is definetly worth reading, it has a certain charm and intrigue combination that make it one of a kind."
4,Love Invents us Blooms with Love,"Amy Bloom creates another wonderful world of a teenage girl growing up in New Jersey, and the men and people that love her. A beautiful read"
5,Great Case for the Magellan SportTrak Series,"If you own a Magellan SportTrak series GPS (I have a SportTrak Pro), this is a great carrying case for it. It fits any size belt, it is very secure and has more than adequate padding to protect your unit from damage."
2,All In His Mind,"Any credibility I gave to the OBE experience and Monroe's ""mapping"" of it as a reality hasbeen destroyed by the contents of this book and his second book ""Far Journeys"". Monroe hassimply invented an ever stranger world in his mind. There is no evidence that these experiencesare anything but his imagination. In fact, science is beginning to explain these experiencesin rather normal terms. Even if he was actually able to move his mind out of his body at willas he contends (which I seriously doubt- there simply is not enough evidence to support it),there is no proof that that ability is in any way related to the afterlife. All ""journeys"" ofMonroe and associates have been while they were living and thus they can say exactly nothingabout what happens after death. Nothing. This is what you get when you base your beliefs onnothing but your own subjective experience."
3,"Enjoyed it, but didn't love it.","This book has two different styles of writing in it. One part is the story of Monroe's journey, the other is where he takes time to define different things he has learned. The stories are interesting, but the technical stuff I found uninteresting, like reading an encyclopedia. I learned to skip those things. I'd read the ""good stuff"" again!"
3,mag is ok but i needed to cancel,"after getting ""renew now - last chance"" from my current Newsweek sub service, i chose Time because it's much cheaper. then i noticed i'm good for another year on Newsweek! i hate that they are so aggressive and predatory with their marketing. so i immediately cancelled and i'll sign up again for Time (providing it stays the same price) next year."
2,Time is old news,"Time used to be relevant. With the advent of a 24-hour news cycle and from competition from more competent mags, Time decided to revamp a month ago or so. There is a new format, new fonts, new features. But what is left is the same tired political agenda, and its readers are the same tired political hacks.I subscribed to a specail $[...] six issue trial. After the first edition, a biased global warming send up, I cancelled it. The stories, letters to the editor and 'opinion pieces' all have a political slant. Some of the letters chosen for publication were downright hateful and disrespectful.Gone is hard news; hello political magazine.I find nothing wrong with political mags. There is a place in this world for tomes like ""The Nation"", ""The Weekly Standard"" and ""Reason"". But don't try to mascarade ""Time"" as hard news anymore.That aside, I do not even like the new format. The layout is cumbersome, the font is hard to read and hard on the eyes. There are also too many advertisements."
1,Glory days behind them now,"Time magazine now is just a void full of advertisements and one sided political banter. It is like fictionalized films that try to present false, twisted information! The only good part about it are some of the cartoons at the beginning of it. Even then, c'mon people I mean wake up, this is a rags rag. I use mine to get the fire in the fireplace going, that is about the extent of its worth to me, but now that I cancelled my subscription I will have to use some NewsWEAK magazines I found in the attic."
2,"I've read Time for over 40 years, but","I finally gave up my subscription. It has turned into a liberal women's magazine. They used to be the best, now they don't really contribute much to your understanding of news events. Pretty sad."
1,Has its place,"While much of the information and emphasis of this magazine is questionable, it does work marvelously lining the bottom of my Parrots cage. Somehow the material that they make the paper from deals with the Parrot waste better than most other paper I have used, exept perhaps that of the NY Times."
1,Time is going downhill,I ordered Time as a gift (half a year subscription) but they charged me for a full year and then they named George Bush as person of year -- HARDLY! I will never take the magazine again.
1,George Bush sucks,"I liked Time magazine a lot until they named George Bush person of the year? Oh my god, where were all the educated editors/writers when they let this moron write this article?"
3,What Can I Say?,I bought this magazine for someone else. I DO NOT READ IT!!!! I guess it's okay - I haven't gotten any complaints about it.It's a magazine! Nothing to write home about!
1,Biased Liberal MSM Crap,"If you are interested in a magazine with every article strongly democratically biased, this is for you.The articles are biased, the cartoons are biased, and the quality is poor. We got subscribed for free, so we decided we might as well get it, but I would NEVER recommend paying for it.If you want a magazine whose editors support crushing in a babies skull, whose quality is poor, and is overpriced, this is what you've been looking for."
5,Great Way to Subscribe,This is a really great way to subscribe or renew a subscription - much cheaper than doing this through the magazine.
4,Overall a good app,"It works quite well on my Galaxy Tab. It forces the portrait mode, even on a 10 inch tab. It appears videos from U-Tube don't work. Some of the zoom pages are a bit cumbersome to navigate but not a major issue. Finding a specific location can take a bit of effort. These are the only negatives I can find. Overall it is a very good app."
4,love getting this in the mail,"I get most of my news via the web these days, but this is one magazine I've continued to subscribe to. Love getting it in the mail each week. It's something I can read quickly and skim though, with just a few minutes. Great for those who want to get a broad overview of what is going on in the world but don't have a lot of time."
1,Unfair Delivery!!!,"This is NOT a review of Time Magazine. It's a wonderful magazine and I heartily recommend it. This is a review of the ""offer"" on Amazon. I renewed my subscription because it seemed like a wonderful deal, $30 for a year. However, according to Time Magazine, when I spoke to them today, the order was processed on Nov. 13, but Time was told to start the subscription with the Dec. 17 issue. They are not permitted to start it earlier. Why? The woman I spoke to certainly did not think it made any sense. I am now going to miss several issues and buying them on the newstand at $4.99 each negates this great offer. Also, the phone number Time gave me to call the ""company I ordered from"" would not allow me to speak to a human being.I have renewed other magazines through Amazon and have never had this problem before. I will think twice now before I ever do it again."
2,"Biased, biased, biased","I used to subscribe to Time. I wanted to keep up on current events. Now the articles just spoon-feed you what position they want you to have and omit or skew important information. A side is taken and all that is written afterwards will promote that side. I expect more from such a publication. They should rename it to TIME EDITIORIAL at least then people will know what they're getting.PS. If you do subscribe and you have young kids, make sure you look at it first. Sometimes the pictures are really graphic."
4,Time magazine subscription,Order went through flawlessly and at a better price than that offered by Time for renewal. I remain perplexed as to why better deals are offered to new subscribers than to loyal existing subscribers.Will use this service again.
4,I like it...,"It's TIME magazine, you like it or you don't. it's fairly left leaning, but still entertaining for a weekly..."
4,Very good overall news magazine,"If you're looking for a magazine to help you stay on top of current events ranging from politics to entertainment, Time is for you. Although the emphasis is on the former, with articles about presidential performance, elections, foreign affairs and the like, you will also find in-depth coverage of national disasters and scandals, major health and welness trends, and a wealth of information on technological advances. Time's milestones and entertainment pages will help you keep track of who is doing what, from dying to litigating. Add to this thought-provoking editorials by major columnists and hilarious takes on just about everything from Joel Stein (who wrote the article on meditation which appeared in the issue featured on this page), and you have an intelligent, enjoyable political news magazine with mass appeal."
5,TIME is the BEST,"The TIME magazine is a well put together weekly magazine that gives you the review of the past week in the news. It has news about the current events in the United States, world news and top stories of the week. The reporting is great for the TIME magazine giving in-depth reports and articles. Many of the stories are going on during the press time of the TIME magazine that many of the articles run into one or several more issues. With a more in-depth look at the world and less political views, I find this magazine better than its main competitor Newsweek.Not only does the TIME Magazine just focus on national and world issues, TIME also has sections that cover personal issues, business, health and more. The great articles usually include great photography. The TIME is packed full of great news and views, and is a great magazine to subscribe to. I am looking forward to checking out the next issue of the TIME magazine."
4,Expressing My Opinion,"Time Magazine helps me keep up with what is happening in the world and the nation. I give it a high rating. In the process of renewing my subscription I made a typo mistake ( I'm 86 yrs. old), and ordered 2 subs. instead of 1. I was notified that it was against policy to send 2 copies to 1 address. Fine with me, figuring they had changed my subs. to 1. Later I recieved a notification charging me for 2 subs, evidently extending my sub. for another year? At almost 87 yrs. I sub. to things for 1 yr., not knowing what tomorrow brings. I would appreciate someone correcting my sub. to 1 yr. not 2. My rating stands at high, including delivery. R.T."
3,Skinny,"Can have interesting articles, especially for current events, but over the years the issues are having less and less pages."
5,Time Magazine,"I bought a Time magazine subscription as a gift for my Mother last year. She loved it and read every issue. So I renewed her subscription again this year. For a weekly magazine, the price is very good."
3,Definitely not a Republican newsmag!,"When I first subscribed to Time, I was impressed with how respectful it was with regard to our current President and I could not believe how many people had lambasted it for the liberal nature which I could not see.However, as 9/11 (the impetus for my purchasing the subscription) faded into the collective subconscious of America, I noticed that the cynicism with which Time regarded both Bush and all Republicans seemed to increase with each passing day. I think that this magazine is fun to read and informative, but I can no longer stomach the contempt with which they hold George W. Bush, so I have allowed my subscription to expire and picked up one to a rival newsmag.If, however, your views are less conservative (perhaps moderate-conservative to ultra-liberal), you can probably enjoy even the most political articles within ""Time""."
1,Have not received it!,I ordered this over a month ago and have yet to receive an issue. I suspect it might have been quicker just to go to the TIME website!
2,gone downhill in content,Iwas surprised at how Time Magazine has changed. Have not had a subscription in over 10 years and the quality of the content in addition to the quality of the paper it is written on has cahnged for the worse.
2,A waste of TIME,"One day I found the urge to get another news magazine (I was already getting US News & World Report)for some wierd reason. I knew Entertainment Weekly and Sports Illustrated were partners to TIME, and since I liked EW and SI so much I expected TIME would be just as good. I was wrong. I was very disapointed at the magazines inability to go in depth on anything. Plus it dumbed everything down and made bad choices in terms of cover material. It wasn't nearly as good as US News. So I canceled and subscribed to Newsweek. I'm warning you: If you want a good news magazine get Newsweek and if you want a great news magazine get US News & World Report. I found them to be way better than TIME. TIME was a waste of time (and money)."
4,New sections an improvement,"I was unsure about renewing my subscription to TIME, a solid-if-unspectacular magazine that delivers in-depth coverage of major domestic stories while spending most of its foreign reporting on Iraq. I have high regard for the new regular sections on History and Law. I will reserve judgement on another new section titled ""The Power of One,"" but Caroline Kennedy's recent work on a New York City principal left something to be desired.If you're looking for deep coverage of world news, this is not the magazine for you--look into The Economist or Foreign Affairs. But as a weekly summary of U.S. news with sharp analysis of the '08 Presidential contenders TIME does just fine."
1,Do the Math,"I picked up a recent, random issue of Time from a pile. And counted:96 pages.- 67 full pages worth of advertisements. (61 full pages, plus 12 half-page ads).-------------------------= 29 pages of ""content""And many articles are like advertisements, covering celebrity,entertainment product, diets, gadgets, and vitamins. Plus 4 pages in the sampled issue cover the ""social trend"" of having your closets customized. So you're left with very little lost in the clutter: Letters to the Editor (that pale next to internet blog posts/responses), short-attention span current event snippets; and Time's news stories with lots of big pictures! Whoopdideedoo!In short, Time seems aimed at intellectually lazy uber-consumers (who are also apparently too lazy to organize they're own closets!) who like Catalogs, and who have very limited interest in what's going on."
2,"Used to be great, but has lost its edge","I used to read Time, used to enjoy its dissection of political, social, and ethical issues. The writing was always top-notch and it never seemed frivolous.Then they started choosing completely inane cover stories (Newsweek has been plagued by the same problem). I don't think its the stories themselves I mind (after all, they stuck Molly Ringwald on the cover in '86), I think its the way the magazine's outlook has changed: they're no longer intellectually stimulating (if ever a magazine was politically correct and completely non-threatening, this is it) and they seem to be content with peddling scientific tabloid fodder (""The science of catching a KILLER""). I cancelled my subscription last year, and nothing has convinced me to renew it. Hopefully, one day something will."
5,Great buy fast shipping,I bought the two year subscribtion kind of skeptikal about whether or not this would work but the first issue arrived within two weeks faster than the estimated guess of four weeks overall i trust amazon with my magazine subscriptions and hey the magazine is a great one thinking about subscribing to newsweek also
3,Long time subscriber but ..,".. I discovered the Economist and understood what a real in depth weekly news magazine could be. Sadly, Time does not really fit the bill anymore for me."
4,Magazines on Amazon,Since I trust the services at Amazon I enjoy being able to find and purchase a wide variety of items. Even though I was not looking for a magazine to read I am grateful to be receiving TIME. It has changed since the last I read it regularly. The changes are for the better. The format is more in tune with the fast pace of daily life in 2009. My first issue was deliverd when it was scheduled. I am grateful. Loraine Tarchinski
3,TIME review,"With cable news limited to no more than a few minutes to any news item or way too much time spent on speculation, we all need ""real news"" with in depth research and reading. And since everyone has an axe to bear, I read both TIME and NEWSWEEK to read two angles of most news stories."
2,"Once great, now a cheap tabloid","Stupid articles glorifying celebrity culture, ""smart & sassy"" commentary about worthless ""news"" topics, and lame articles about the latest fad toys. Hooray. I don't know what happened to this magazine. Its journalistic standards went out the window, and has been replaced by a disgusting obsession with sensationalism. Filled with watered-down commentary and dumbed-down prime-time television style investigative reporting, you might as well call it ""McNews."""
1,Auto-renewal blaaat!,Auto-renewal puts you at the distributor's mercy. They simply charge you whatever price they feel like. You are better off searching for a deal before it auto-renews. Time Magazine was $30 auto-renew and $20 direct from the publisher.
3,Time?,This magazine is ok... I beleive some informantion on Time may not be all true. Other magazines call them out.
2,"At least it's not ""Newsweek""","""Time"" is a cultural icon and has set the standard for newsweeklies for many years. What's still good about ""Time"" are the stellar (if editorially selective) photos, the relevant and intriguing topics, and the range of stories.What's still bad about ""Time"" is its unrelenting liberal bias and subtle shading and twisting of the truth. A conservative perspective from time-to-time would freshen things up, not to mention adding more balance and credibility to the proceedings here.Some of the great old columnists and reporters have gone, leaving ""Time"" now with less stylistic personality. It is slickly professional; but almost coldly so. The color is lacking. It still beats the heck out of the abyssmal ""Newsweek,"" but a great publication should never be satisfied to be better than a weak rival. It should strive for accuracy, integrity, balance, and freshness."
1,person of the year,I cancelled my suscription to Time magazine last year when they put Bush on the cover not only once after he stole the first election but again after he started this unjust and illegal war in Iraq. I think the editors of this magazine need to have their heads examined by alienating almost half of the voting population in this country.
1,Feel cheated,"I was told that Obama was on every cover and that's why I signed up for this. But last month, no Obama. Maybe next month he will be on it."
2,Time Magazine subscription renewal bungled,"Time is a great new magazine. I purchased a subscription for my son-in-law as a Christmas present 2011. When I tried to renew it as a Christmas present for 2012, the order was mismanaged. Instead of sending issues to my gift recipient, issues were sent to me. It turns out that Amazon does not manage magazine subscriptions itself but outsources these to an outfit called Synapse. Amazon is famous for outstanding customer service. Kudos for that. It's reputation will suffer if it surrenders customer service to third parties. Adding a third party to the transaction, without any notification that this is happening, is unwise, deceptive, and detrimental to Amazon's reputation."
2,Have not received an issue,I have yet to receive an issue of this magazine even though it was a renewal. Not really sure who to blame. I hope it eventually arrives and is added on to my current subscription.
3,Not sure this has worked...,I'm doing an auto renewal of my TIME subscription but am not sure yet whether it has switched over seamlessly or not. I feel like I might have missed an issue or two. Because I am unsure I am giving a middle of the road rating. I will go back and change it if all is well.
4,Great Overview of Events,"Time comes weekly and gives me an in-depth coverage of the most important world/national events. Having read the entire magazine leaves me feeling informed and able to discuss these subjects well, and the writing is clear and unbiased. The ""fluff"" articles towards the back are entertaining. I will continue my subscription."
2,"You have the internet, why do you need Time?","The news cycle has made Time completely irrelevant. It has never been an in depth magazine. It will never challenge you to think or cause you to question what you are told. It is a useless rag that pumps out advertising for Time Warner. Please, save your money for your monthly internet bill."
1,Establishment Pablum,"Time is more of a propaganda tabloid than a news magazine. No matter what your political slant you're are not going to get the truth here (or even a logical defense of their opinions). By all appearances, the staff of Time is completely in thrall to the nations political and corporate public relations firms. Instead of news we are offered homogenized establishment pablum. It's better to get a liberal AND a conservative journal. I recommend Harper's magazine and the New American magazine. Both are excellent and you are given enough information you can actually decide for yourself what to think."
1,No delivery on goods!,Although I waited before filling this review out to give ample time for delivery. I have not recieved one copy of the Time magazine I have ordered. Will never order like this again.
3,Time is Losing its Touch,"A year ago, I could not wait for my Time to arrive every Tuesday. Now, when it arrives, I glance at the Table of Contents and skim a couple of articles. In my opinion, the magazine has become too pop culture. The entire back section is devoted to articles like Brad and Angelina's baby. Don't get me wrong, Time still has great political/historical articles, like this week's Special Report on Teddy Roosevelt. But in general, I think the magazine is declining and will eventually become a ""sophisticated"" People Magazine."
1,not pleased,1 I did not order automatic renewal2 I thought I ordered 1 yearplease clarifyTime: The Illustrated History of the World's Most Influential Magazine
2,Sometimes a non-establishment nugget,"I flip through Time every now and again at the barber shop. Sometimes there are good bits that they are using to keep the interest of people who want progressive social change, people who are sick of the power of the corporate elite and the violence of our militarists.For the most part, since Time receives most of its revenues from Big Business advertisements, it can't challenge the establishment as it needs to.So instead I read magazines like Z, Utne, Mother Jones, The Progressive, The Sun, Earth Island and the New Internationalist."
2,Liberal Rag,"This ancient weekly continues to be a must read for those who like their news slanted to the left. Like most major media outlets, Time Magazine deftly keeps you informed of just what they want you to hear while pursuing selected topics as top stories timed to coinside with current liberal political agendas. Editorially they make it no secret as to their liberal ideology,which is fine. I just wish Time would have guts to reveal their agenda up front instead of quiet manipulation through timed event revelations. In todays world there are many choices as to where you get your news information and I would advise, if you are a clear thinking person who makes His or Her decisions based on all sides of a story, that you look elsewhere for your news. For the rest of you,there is still Time."
1,Who reads this ... anyway?,This magazine was cool for squares to read in the 60's. I got sick of reading this mainstream propaganda in the 80's. It's time for this irrelevant corporate pablum to go the way of the buggy whip.Give it to the MAN! Think for yourself.
3,The times have not been good for TIME...,"I have read TIME for 45 years and will always want to do so. There are frequent in-depth articles that could never be reproduced in daily print media--and can never be matched on-line. Along with NEWSWEEK and U.S. NEWS AND WORLD REPORT, TIME has a proud history of informing mainstream Americans about the world around them.This said, however, there has been a daunting decline in the ""serious"" news reported in recent years. The quantity of news has gone down, leaving a thinner and thinner magazine. And worse yet, there has been an attempt to ""popularize"" its reporting with frequent touches of PEOPLE-type articles; sensational and trivial.Print media, such as TIME, are struggling for readership numbers and advertising dollars. I hope they find their way; I'll be here a while longer..."
2,Too Dumbed Down,"I will be cancelling my subscription to Time Magazine. In an effort to increase their appeal, they have done the opposite. The magazine has gotten as silly and irrelevant as TV news. It is simply too dumb to merit reading."
2,Sensationalist Entertainment for the Masses,"I subscribed to Time for a few years, then I discovered The Economist. The difference is enormous.While Time is rather parochial, the other is truly international. Where Time writes about whatever subject happens to be popular at the time, The Economist offers comprehensive coverage weighed in order of its political and economic significance.If you want entertainment, buy Time. If you wish to be well informed, buy The Economist."
1,Nothing there,"Fewer pages, less substance, little real news, some entertainment news. Just not worth it."
2,Saccharine writing style,"I couldn't get past the first chapter or so because of the long, slow, saccharine style of writing. However, a friend of mine absolutely loved the book, so I guess different strokes for different folks."
5,The best Dog book I ever read,This was the best book I have read about a single dog- his life and his owner's are skillfully told in this great true story. I have never been into hunting dogs but I enjoyed every minute of their travels and adventures - the dog came alive in my mind and the end certainly made me cry. Rick Bass told a great story about a magnificent unique animal.
4,Wonderful moments hunting and living with just the right dog,"For anyone who has owned or does own a GSP this is a great book. The author conveys the wonderful crazy personality these dogs have along with their love of the hunt. Truly, time outdoors with a dog like this makes the world come alive. While the author is flawed as a hunter, he does a perfect job of describing the environment and feeling of working with a hunting dog. Half the fun is the joy and surprise of seeing the flushed bird take off. You, the reader, are right there with Colter! This was a wonderful read and true eacape!"
5,Dog Lovers,For any dog lover this is a great read. Bass is a very sensitive and descriptive writer. You will laugh and cry as you relate to this personal story.
2,"Not what a ""dog lover"" would want to read","I really hoped this book was going to live up to the reviews and although I am not a hunter I still thought I could enjoy the read. Instead of a book about a man loving his dog, it was more about man loving himself and not really being a great owner. Not the ending that made me feel this way but just overall the whole story itself. Unless you are a hunter who wants to hear about different hunting trips this guys made then I say skip it. Not really a book for animal/dog lovers!"
2,Disappointed me,"I was disappointed in the book because it failed to convey the delight of living with and training a dog like Colter. The author captures the wonder of the basic genetic heritage of his dog: bottomless energy, enthusiasm, natural obsession with birds. But he doesn't help the dog improve and grow more proficient, he seems to tolerate sloppiness and disrespect for the owner. It seems to me to be a story of wasted potential when it could have been a story about pride and bonding based on mutual accomplishments."
2,Book for Hunters,"This is a book for hunters, specifically bird hunters. It probably should have been titled, ""Colter: The True Story of the Best Bird Hunting Dog I ever Had.""As someone not the least bit interested in hunting, I found all the ""bumped the birds,"" ""flushed the birds,"" ""pointed,"" ""Did or didn't shoot the birds,"" a bit repetitive and tedious. And as a person owned by a dog and a dog lover, I really saw little interaction between man and dog other than while hunting. I'm sure this is a binding experience, but no play wrestling with the dog, no pretending you know what the dog is saying (telepathicaly) when he barks or leads you?And a lost opportunity to excoriate losers who shoot dogs because they hate them, or for fun, or out of jealousy, or because they're drunk and want to take out their aggression.Sorry, I really don't understand why this book received such favorable reviews. I do not recommend it except for hunters."
1,Amateurs,"Surely the author allowed his emotions free rein here as Colter IS handsome and energetic, but after one vignette follows another it becomes clear #1 that the author is an environmentalist but certainly not a hunter. The man can't shoot worth beans and poor Colter is embarrassed by him. #2 is that the dog (at least as portrayed by the author) can't hunt! What a combination! Oh, his sense of smell is vintage. And a few times it all comes together. But the majority of times you wonder when he'll get to the GOOD stuff. Tell us why he thinks Colter is the best. HE screws up and Colter screws up. Page after page. And THIS was the greatest dog alive? Better a story about Maddie! Clearly an author with too much money and time on his hands. Cradled in environmentalist claptrap. But the love of a dog CAN turn brains to mush. And the publisher inflicts it upon us all."
2,These are tiny,I was expectin the ramekins to be somewhat larger. In addition to the teeny weeny size they are very shallow. May get a few tablespoons of creme brulee out of each dish!
1,DON'T DO IT!,"Do not buy it!!! Anybody that makes 4 ounces of creme brlée for anybody...is a loser and causing cruelty to human beings...or whatever is going to eat it. I was soooo excited to get some oval ramekins that I didn't bother to take in the 4 oz size part of this deal. I only have round and deep ones but really wanted the oval ones which can be quite pricey at some places. So here I thought I was getting a deal and would possibly buy 4 more, but dang they are small!!! I would not recommend :(. And they are cheaply made, I just used mine for SUPER BOWL 44 this past Sunday, for dips...lol (guacamole, salsa, and sour cream) of all things because they are so small. Anyway, one of them is chipped in two places already just from washing in the sink. Thank god they were only 20 bucks!"
2,are they safe?,"I was pleased to locate these dishes and bought two sets for creme brulee. However, I was displeased when they arrived and I realized the bottom of each dish is labelled not only with the Bonjour name but also with ""made in china."" No where did it mention where they were made. I now worry that they may not be safe - due to a high lead level in the glaze."
2,"Passable; but poor quality, had to return 2 of 4 sets:","Ultimately, they are OK for the inexpensive items that they are. There are blemishes (lumps, flow marks) in the glaze on practically all the bowls. Two of the four sets had crevices/gaps in the glaze that were unacceptable. Amazon was great about exchanging them, though. If these weren't so inexpensive I'd recommend against buying them. You get what you pay for."
2,too bulky,This product is way too bulky and does not have a clip to attach to a belt.You have to wear a special strap which makes you look like a tourist on the subway.Don't buy it.
1,2 Sony Ericsson Cases,"I am a long time supporter of Sony Ericsson and enjoy their products but this one is not up to par to their other products. When I had this product I would attach it to my belt and my phone fit quite well even though I'm not a big fan of the velcro sound. The main complaint I have with this case is that the back portion that you must slip onto your belt breaks apart too easily and is not worth the buy. I've had two of these cases and both of them ripped apart in the back rendering this case useless. Must be a defect. I'm sure there are other cases out there that can compliment your Sony Ericsson but for now, I just keep mines in my pocket."
4,HERE WE GO,"I was on the verge of paying $40 for this c.d. until my mother got me some gift certificates so I only ended up paying $12.She has some decent songs on the album:All I WantTime After TimeWait For YouFreakyLove You DownI love the girl but I don't know what Lil' Jon and Jermaine were thinking when they did her album. All the beats sound the same. I still like it though. I wish they would re-release this album though. The single is more likely to be found then the album.If you do come across this cd, get it anyway cause you won't get anywhere else!"
2,Not so great Debut,"Where did Inoj go wrong?She had two hit singles ""Love U Down"" and ""Time after Time"".Then she released ""Ring my Bell"" which flopped and anounced she was releasing her debut album.The album never was released in the US.Maybe her record company heard the album a decided it was best not released.I would agree if that was their decision.This album is almost all ballads,Inoj's strong points are her more uptempo tracks(this cd is missing those high points).Do yourself a favor buy the singles wait for the album to hit the bargain bins."
2,"Mr. Nasman's ""Exploring.....Chief Architect, v. 9.5","If you alaready own Chief Architect, Version 9.5, this book offers very little to assist you. The manual you received withthe software is far better. The book is elementary at best, and definitely not worth the hefty price being asked. It is well written, but offers absolutely nothing to a new user who is encountering problems using the program, or to anyone who wishes to design and draw something beyond a 4-wall garage. If you already own the program, you have already been provided with better manuals. This one will not help you."
1,sizing quite small,"bought xtra large for my female german shepherd dog , but was way too small, item description said suitable for german shepherd..dissapointed, would be lovely on smaller type dog..."
3,XL is too small for Labs,"I should have paid more attention to the other reviews that say the XL is too small. It certainly is. I have a very normal size Lab (70 lbs) and it wouldn't even wrap around his tummy. Good thing it's only 10/23, I still have some time to get my pooch a costume."
2,Still TOO small!,"After reading the reviews for this costume and seeing that everyone was having problems with it being too small, I ordered a size larger than recommend for my dog. He is a 50 lb Australian Cattle Dog and I ordered the XL (which is recommended for german shepards and rotties) and it is WAY too small. Although I could fasten the velcro, he could not walk in it! I think another customer said it right, the leg holes are just not cut out for dogs. If you hold the costume in a vertical position, it looks like it would fit a small child perfectly. It's just not made for dogs! Too bad because it's really cute (why I even cosidered the 2 stars) and now too late for me to order anything else!"
2,Very Experimental,"I am a fan of Anthony Newley and I knew when I ordered this that it wasn't his usual type of stuff so I wasn't too surprised that I didn't care much for it. I also didn't know who John Cranko was (still really don't have a clue) and if I had known I might have held off on purchasing this. Having said that, I hesitate to say I don't like it. It is very experimental and I imagine I might enjoy it more if I were sitting in an audience watching it live. There are portions of it that I find quite interesting but it isn't something I would put on for sheer enjoyment's sake."
4,Exceeded my Expectations!,This product is great! It exceeded my expectation. It almost 100 % leather and very professional looking.You can!t go wrong with this one.
1,Sure it Works..But an extra $50 will buy you a better one!,"The case seems shotty and the ON/OFF button is too touchy... I ran out of batteries on my camping trip to Yellowstone ""thanks alot ON/OFF button DO NOT BUY THIS! Spend an extra $50 and get a good one!"
3,Great size for small purse,This is a great little wallet with lots of room for cards. My only complaint is that there is no place to put bills in like a regular wallet which is a definite drawback. I am dealing with it because I really like the size for use in my small purse.
4,Review of Joyce in the Belly of the Big Truck,"I was presently surprised the depth of thought included in this book. The author thinks deep and sometimes I felt too deep. As a professional driver with over a million miles, I could relate to her experiences and sympathize with her disappointments. I did not approve of her ""Life - Style choices, but I did like the way she explained her experiences while an OTR driver. I would recommend this book to any entry-level driver who is fresh out of school and ready to "" Hit the Road"".I was glad to see that she finishes what she starts. Even in the face of discouragement she was motivated to complete what she had initially agreed to do."
3,Interesting...,"but not more. Fun to read, but not a serious study of Yiddish lgg and culture. (The title probably reflects its nature better than the subtitle.)"
4,"Great book, but beware the audio book version","Like most previous reviewers, I loved this book. I did want to mention that the audio version, narrated by the author, is problematic. On the positive front, the author pronounces Yiddish correctly! The problem is in how he pronounces English. He has a very odd way of speaking, with the last word of each sentence articulated very slowly (str-e-e-e-etched out) and about three notes lower than every other word in the sentence. Every sentence ends with a melodic downturn. I found it quite maddening and really had trouble enjoying the book because of it. You may want to be careful if you plan to buy the audio book because his diction is really rather odd."
2,Born to Kvetch,Not nearly so good as Hyman Kaplan or the Joys of Yiddish. It is a good book for someone who wants a detailed study of Yiddish.
4,Humorous and well researched,"Michael Wex has written a book that is both scholarly and hilarious! He has succeeded in describing the complex origins of the Yiddish language with the humor of a stand-up comedian. This book is not for those unfamiliar with Jewish-Yiddish culture. The humor will be lost for you. However, for those who grew up in such an environment, you will find yourself laughing outloud. Some of his descriptions regarding the development of Yiddish are a bit confusing, but for the most part, this book is an enjoyable read and an accurate portrayal of Yiddish culture."
4,"A Yiddish sociology primer, not ""just"" a linguistics book","First, this is a funny book, despite the kvetchers who complain it isn't. But, it isn't *just* a funny book, it's a quite serious one.The sociology of Ashkenazy life mean that it has to be serious. Even there, some things were explained seriously; even the euphemisms can be more serious.The humor, also, is never written in a Yiddish joke book style, but rather to tell how and why the humor of a particular phrase evolved.My one big complaint/observation is that the glossary/dictionary could have been larger."
4,"In the Ground, Baking Bagels","I am not Jewish, but I grew up in Jewish homes and am guilty of being a Jew wannabe, if there is such a thing.Not everyone seems to have loved this book, but after Wex's explanation of Talmudic scholarship, I would have expected no less. This book is scholarly, witty, insightful and revealing. The style is a little odd, in that a series of cultural insights is followed by a page of definitions; that's the only reason I withhold the last star. That said, he takes us in the darkest and earthiest origins of the Yiddish language and how it reflects the restless and oppressed culture that formed it.One of my favorites is the expression that translates to: ""I'm lying in the ground, baking bagels"" given in response to the question ""how's business?""If you're lying in the ground baking bagels, you're obviously dead, it's hot,you're working instead of resting, you're dead and there's no one to even sell the bagels to.....You get it."
4,a review by a goy,"do you know why Jews leave stones of grave markers? It's because it was once believed that reading gravestones would dull your memory, so you needed to counteract that magic- but stone magic can only be counteracted by stone magic- and only when the stones are touching. Interesting, no?If you're looking for more interesting ways to disparage Christianity than the normal idiotic blatherings of atheists, check out this book- yiddish is full of idiomatic expressions relating to Jesus that do not put That Man in a good light.a fantastic book, and well written- if you are an aficionado of Jewish culture, or have spent any time at all in NY, you'll love this book, whether or not you yourself are a Jew."
4,kvetch,very funny. very informative. maybe a little too much information but the first 50 pages are great.
3,Feels Cheap,"I bought this knife because it has exactly the tool-set I was looking for in a picnic knife. The actual blade and tool mechanisms are great; on par with every other Swiss Army knife I've ever owned, however the thin plastic scales and painted-on Victorinox badge make the knife feel like a knock-off. This might seem petty, but one of the reasons I buy Swiss Army knives again and again is their attention to detail, and this one falls short in the 'fit and finish' category."
2,I didn't like it,Not enough artworkI was expecting more alien designsRecommended to H.R. Giger Fans. You taste in art needs to be very particular for you to enjoy these artworks.
4,"If you own only one Giger book, this should be the one.","To say Giger is obsessed with death and sex would not be far off the mark, and he combines this with ubiquitous and evocative mechanical motifs to produce images that will burn their way forever into your mind. Giger communicates his menacing, fantastic, dark, richly detailed yet at times spectrally abstract visions with unexpected force. This is a first rate collection by one of the truly unique artists of the 20th century."
5,His most brilliant work condensed into this outstanding work,"After having seen some of Giger's work in Alien and some other more well know work I decided to buy Biomechanics. It was very good, but the Necronomicon is THE pilot book for all the rest of his works. It contains his most outstanding work as far as weird and the macabe go. A tour de force of his strange mind. A wonderous collection of strange and terrible images masterfully done. It is quite disturbing to look at but wonderfully fascinating at the same time. I guarantee if you buy this book you will not be able to put in down until you have read all the notes and seen every last picture, it's that good."
5,"Crass, penetrating, bedrock samples of Giger's macabre work.","Here is an excellent foundation of H.R. Giger's work for those sci-fi die-hards who appreciate intense subjects in both text and art. This books shows a wide range of H.R.'s various styles, each one drilling through contemporary notions of form, etiquette, and courtesy. It is a no-nonsense expose' of the nightmare-ish alter-dimensional world of Giger's dreams which taps into the source of human fear. I most strongly recommend this and all the other art books by H.R Giger to all folks who can think for themselves, who can put reality, physics, religion, politics, morals, mathmatics, et. al. in their own separate boxes for a moment, and who seek a startling sidebar from the mundane world. EWH"
4,Hard to chew,"Although well packaged and delivered in excellent condition, these chocolates were drier than I expected and were rather hard to bite into. Maybe that's why they were on sale!"
3,"Usable, but overpriced","This drive has a lot of features packed onto a small unit.Pros:FM Radio.Plays mp3s (including vbr).small size.backlit screen.Plugs right into usb slot.Headphones have volume control and actually sound okay.Cons:Drag and drop copies files out of order in windows, so mp3s will play out of order--unit does not sort alphabetically. To get around this I copy them to the unit using a DOS prompt, which copies them one by oneForgets your settings (including track volume) and what song you were playing when you turn it off.Lousy bass response.No WMA support.Feels very cheap and fragile.Hold switch does not prevent buttons from being pressed--only prevents deletion of data from the unit. The former is more useful, though why couldn't it just do both?No clip of any sort."
2,Did not work for satellite antena,"I do not know if it is designed for satellite antennas,but it did not work for DIrectTV. Maybe the part was defective?the screws were also out of axis , the part seems to be made in a garage like shop.Low quality."
1,Doesn't fit on the jack,"This junky thing won't screw onto the jack on the back of my modem, or the wall outlet. I have used more than one cable to make those connections in the past, so it isn't an issue with the wall outlet or modem."
1,Not worth it and reviews are suspicious,"Personally, the book is just ok. Why are all the great reviews by ""A CUSTOMER"" and the not so great are identified by names? Rather suspicious, imo."
1,Say NO to low dose hormone pills for perimenopause,"I have been suffering with perimenopause for years. I've been put on so many 'low dose' birth control pills for this and wondered why I always felt worse when taking them. Well, finally had my estrogen blood work done not too long ago, and guess what? My estrogen is off the charts HIGH! I am estrogen dominant. No wonder those little pills made me feel so horrible, they were giving me more of what I already had too much of. Have your blood estrogen checked. See where you stand, then make your decision. I'm sure the pill is fine if you are low, but make sure first! Now all I take is NATURAL (not synthetic) progesterone cream, and a good woman's multivitamin, and get plenty of filtered water and fiber. It will make a difference!! This book looks to me like it was written by a sales rep for the (low dose estrogen hormone pill) drug companies..."
3,Disguised ad for low dose birth control pills?,"The book was informative but it seemed to me that the answer to everything was low dose birth control pills and any other solution was suspect. Fortunately, I didn't stop my research with just one book. I also read ""What Your Doctor May Not tell you about Premenopuase"". I can't say I agree with all that either but I like the idea of having alternatives. I am currently trying out the progresterone cream with some positive results after only a few weeks. And I intend to keep reading..."
4,Sound Advice and Easy to Read Format,"This book provides a straightfoward checklist on the symptoms of perimenopause. The easy to read format and the humourous cover makes me laugh (instead of cry about this stage of life.)The book is well organized around symptoms, medical and natural treamtents. It provides a substantial amount of information in a straightforward not-too-scientific voice. Dr. Goldstein emphasizes that surgery is the last resort for menstrual problems and outlines new treatments for perimenopausal symptoms. If I had one criticism of the book, it's that he oversells the pill as the cure all treatment."
1,Obsolete - Satellites No Longer in Operation,"I recently ordered one of these from a third-party seller on Amazon. When it arrived, it refused to connect to a satellite. When I called Magellan to see what was wrong, I was told that the product was obsolete, and that it was set to use satellites that were no longer in operation. Nothing could be done to make the unit work. I was able to return the product, but I had to pay for the shipping charges. This may have been a good product at one time, but it is of no use today."
4,Great Unit - Great Features - Great Price,"I purchase this item for myself for Christmas. I will admit - I boutght this gadget because of commercial on TV with the guy walking around the apartment computing distances and travel times to various locations. A GPS unit is an absolute must for ""data geeks"". I love being able to utilize all of the useful (useless) information that this little unit provides. I would like to see improved battery life, but outside of that - I am a happy and informed camper."
3,"not bad, but maps are better",Liked the reception of this vs. the Garmin unit I had previously. But soon learned that maps are the way to go. I upgraded to a Map330 soon after trying the 315.
5,Magellan GPS 315 Used for Years,"I have used this product on trips, in the woods, traced trails on my property and mapped them using Topo Software. The features are great. Used it on a cruise and knew exactly where we were on the ocean at all times. Great product. Good coverage."
4,Can it be too soft?,This toothbrush is very soft. Perhaps too soft. It doesn't seem to be able to remove anything from my teeth. I really can't even feel the bristles when I use it.
3,Disappointed,"I'm getting married in September, so I bought this dress as one my dresses to wear during the reception. To me, in person the dress doesn't accurately reflect the picture. The dress itself is beautiful, but the dress is not white, it's more off-white (I wouldn't go as far as to call it cream-color). Also, the picture made the flowers look mostly navy blue with some lighter shades of blue. Navy is the color of our wedding, which is why I bought the dress, but only some of the flowers are navy, but mostly are pale purple, with some even dark gray and black. It's a beautiful dress, just not what I had hoped for my special day. I'm deciding now whether to keep it for another occassion."
1,leaky bottle,"I got the product on time, but the middle bottle (Obsession, smaller one) was leaky and at least 25% of the liquid from the bottle. Moreover the box itself says the listed price as $68 so how can the seller claim that the list price is $95Obsession Night by Calvin Klein for Women, Set (Eau De Parfum Spray 3.4 Ounce, Body Lotion 6.7 Ounce, Obsession Mini Eau De Parfum Spray 0.5 Ounce)"
4,Book I've been waiting for,"I've had a string of bad luck with computer books lately so I was hesitant to get this one but I'm glad I did. The title says it all. I would not encourage people who are new to Maya or people who already know MEL to read this book, but for those of us experienced Maya animators who need a place to start with MEL it's perfect. Very well done and clearly written."
3,Disappointing,"I ordered this book after my DBIL brought me back some lambskins from Ecuador. Having never worked with leather I had no clue where to start. Sandy's last article in Threads was so inspiring but I was disappointed in the book. The book will be helpful to me as far as the basics go, but samples shown in Threads magazine and online were much better - at least for my taste."
4,Time for an 8th Edition?,"Akehurst's Modern Introduction to International Law provides a sound basis for understanding the United Nations, treaties, and international law. The only drawback to the book is that the material is becoming somewaht dated with its 1997 copyright.The book has gone through a number of reprints in between 1998 and 2004 leading me to suggest a 8th edition for 2006. The bookprovided an academic premier for a course in Space Law. I enjoyed the Latin legal terms spread throughout the text. I do recommend that the reader have some prior knowledge of the law to more fully appreciate the text."
3,better books around,"the main issue i take with this book is the poor annotation done. He'll make cryptic comments like ""he cannot afford to do so and so move"" at a critcal point in the game and not explain himself. What he means isn't self-explanitory either. As far as books annotating games go I'd recommend Alekhines best games of chess between the 1920's and 1940's (or whatever the title is). Much better book with better games too (in my humble opinion."
3,Warman's Little Golden Books Field Guide: Values and Identification,Not what I expected. Vauge in alot of areas of valuation and no Australian titles which has really not helped me at all.
1,Misleading Junk Food Drink,"Look at the ingredients. Mostly Sugar and Water. May as well have a soft drink and take a vitamin pill.I am disgusted with Nestle. They are supposed to be a houshold name.Junk Food, dont buy it"
2,canceled when they raised price,"at first i thought this service was great. I got a case of boost for $22 with free shipping. A few weeks later i went online to see when next shipment would be, that's when i discovered the price hike. They raised the price of the case by $18! nearly doubling it! i couldn't believe it. I'm glad i had checked subscription and found this price change. i immediately canceled. Subscription would have been great if it stayed at same price."
2,TOO MUCH SUGAR,"I should have read the ingredients closer -- I assumed a nutritional drink would be healthy. Instead, they put 27 GRAMS OF SUGAR IN EACH BOTTLE! That's just not healthy."
5,not satisfied that Amazon is skipping my delivery,"First of all I want to congratulate Amazon for offering this excellent product. Our 3 children really like it and they go through 3-4, 24 bottle packs every month. It is an excellent nutritional drink for young and old.So now i am told that Amazon is skipping the delivery for this month since it is not on stock. This is very disappointing. This is such a popular product that Amazon needs to ensure that they stock it at proper levels."
1,Overpriced,"This is incredibly overpriced!!! Walmart sells this product everyday, 12 pack for less than $13 and double that is $26. No shipping just drive and pick it up."
1,Not for those allergic to milk,"I am always interested in these nutrional drinks like Ensure and now Boost. I look at the ingredients on line and they don't say they contain a milk protein. I found Boost at Walmart where they said it was located and read the ingredients. All contain Milk Protein. Milk is a toxin to my body, and I wish they would leave this little item out of their product, or make one that does not contain milk. There are many people like me who are allergic to milk. My uncle had throat cancer and lived on Ensure for three years, so I know these nutrional products are good. But they, unfortunately are not for everyone. I wish they were. I would definately try them, and their recipes if they were."
5,wellness,A great product that will benefit and compliment the lack of certain vitamins and supplements that our diet fails to give us. You will enjoy the flavor as though it were a shake. Results are positive and would recommend highly.
4,Good Flavor/ Best Price,"I liked to try Boost Chocolate! It's a good nutritional energy drink, can substitute one meal and have good taste!"
1,New chocolate taste is awful,"I've been drinking Boost for years...had one on the way to work every morning. They recently changed their packaging and taste. First of all, I'm happy that they finally decided to go with recyclable bottles. What I'm not happy about is their new taste. I'm not sure if this new recipe saves them money but in the end, their sales numbers will likely take a hit. I can't understand why a company would want to redefine a product that was already great to begin with.I'll be switching to nestle carnation instant breakfast shakes (dark chocolate flavor to be specific). It's not quite as good as boost's old taste but it trumps their new taste. But then again, that isn't too difficult to do. I hope that they come to their sense's one day and switch back to their previous chocolate taste."
2,New Rich Cholocolate flavor sucks,"Not sure if you folks noticed. Boost Chocolate has a new packaging and a 'great new' taste called ""Rich Chocolate"" to go with it. It is starting to taste close to Chocolate Ensure which I hate since it tastes so artificial - nothing like a chocolate drink. Looks like I will have to look somewhere else for a chocolate energy drink."
3,Typical music from mid 60`s to early 70`s.Duos music is not the same.,"This box includes all recordings from 60`plus upto late 72.There is a big difference in music from the late 50`s.It is easy to hear that it is not ordinary cigarettes they are smoking,it is reflected in the liveshow from 69.Weird show,they where not focused on the music.This box is looking amazing,extra DVD is good.The book is a amazing,big,much pictures.It is a diary of Everly Brother`s musical activities.This is for diehard Everly Brothers fan."
5,Excellent Defense of the Craft,I read this book about a year ago and i have been meaning to re-read it. It is an excellent and well-documented book defending Freemasonry. Anyone looking to better their understanding of Freemasonry (in a balanced way) should read this book.Tarikh Bandele
3,"Not awful, but a bit disappointing","First, let me say that I read this book and Fee's and Stuart's book ""How to Read the Bible for all its Worth"" in the same month. My analysis: Although they were written in the same style and utilize similar material, I thought ""Playing with Fire"" was not quite as clear and not as thought-provoking as ""Read the Bible."" Truly Dr. Russell is a thinker--I am fully impressed with their Bible program at Biola--and if I had not read ""Read the Bible"" at the same time, perhaps I would have liked his book more than I did. Russell does utilize some beneficial charts and makes several good points throughout. However, while this book could be beneficial, I hestitate to recommend it when there is a better book on the same subject available to you."
1,bigfoot or grandama?,well as we all know bigfoot is not only a hoax but also a tall tale.. u might want to get your childish mind into shape and stop reading childrens book's-Debbie Prevost & David Hochmanps: good luck on the baby project from Fortuna Middle School
2,Quality issue for Region 1 version.,While this does appear to be a professional copy it has some serious quality issues with the picture. Anytime the camera pans across the screen the film freezes intermittently. This seems to have occurred in the transfer from the original format to DVD. If you want to see this movie you can sit through what I described and enjoy it. I wish the original or current owner of this production would release a professional copy.
1,Amazon.com,I already had the singles. I was lead to believe these would be two different Judge Judy episodes. This was a scam. It was advertised with the two singles plus the 2-pack. But the 2-pack consisted of the same 2 singles. SO I got stuck with 2 each of the SAME dvd's. Shame on you.
5,Human Lie-Detector,I used to watch this show on tv and it was good. Actually it still is. Theese cases are anyway. My two favorite are when the couple sue a limosine service after they caused them to miss their prom and the girl who sues the popular kid at school for the cost of her dress after he stood her up for the homecoming dance. A lot of the others are good too. the only problem is that some of them are a little to serious. However you should still get it because its good.
5,Very pleased with this item,I received this organizer today and I have to agree with all the other reviewers. The acrylic is very thick and durable looking. Very smooth and shiny and clean looking. It looks like it will last for years. Well designed too. I like how you can take the lipstick holder out and use the compartment for other stuff. I thought it was a little pricey but I'm glad I went ahead and got it. I shouldn't have to buy another cosmetic organizer for quite awhile.
5,The only cosmetics organizer that isn't tacky looking,"This is the perfect size for the tank lid, and has lots of different size compartments for lipstick, pencils, nail polish, etc. It's actually quite attractive as long as it's kept clean and orderly; cosmetics have a tendency to get messy over time, but it washes well."
4,great product for the price,"this organizer is set up really well, but my one issue is that the spots to fit lipstick are just a little too small to fit most of my lipsticks. a few fit, but not many."
5,Great gift for teenagers,"Bought several of these as gifts and they were very gratefully received. They fit brushes, polishes, foundation and anything else that you can squeeze in. Solid and they look like they will last."
4,One of the most underrated sports films ever,"The amazon.com review for this film includes the line ""While sharp and funny, it's never quite clear what the point of it all is."" If this is all a GREAT WHITE HYPE viewer gets out of this movie, i'm afraid he/she just wasn't paying attention. While providing a nice satirical look at egomaniacal athletes and hustling boxing promoters (Sam Jackson is as brilliantly watchable as always here) throughout, the movie is all about how hype can make a non-event an event and the film's last ten minutes is the key. What, you were expecting a ROCKY denouement? In the end, this movie shows how sports fans -- and the entertainment-junkie public in general -- can be manipulated by loudness and money. Combined with Shelton's ever-sharp and fearless takes on America's racial tension (also see the brilliant WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP), THE GREAT WHITE HYPE is well worth a watch. And a think thereafter."
2,The Bland White Hype,"""The Great White Hype"" is a satire all about boxing, with Samuel L. Jackson as the flamboyant,devious promoter. All cares about his $$$$,no matter how he gets it. He finds an alcoholic boxer who'd rather rock&""raise awareness about the homeless situation"",tries to make him a champ, and promotes him as an Irishman (though he isn't)To its credit, ""The Great White Hype"" is often done in the style of a mockumentary,and there's good acting. It mocks political correctness. The ""Irish"" boxer,Robert Conklin,refuses to wear white gloves... because it would be racist! The ""champion"" (Damon Wayans) watches the blaxploitation movie ""Dolemite"" before the pivotal fight. ""Great White Hype"" is more about celebrity cameos (Cheech Marin, Jeff Goldblum, Corbin Bernsen, Jamie Foxx, Jonathan Rhys-Davies) than a script with any substance. It's more of a ""name that famous face"" than follow the story.""Great White Hype"" attempts to be cutting satire-but it ends up dull."
3,Pretty Good Satire,this Film Isn't as Strong as it Should or COuld Be.Still Samuel L.Jackson Doing His Best Don King Take is very Funny.Damon Wayans does Good Here as well.with a Stronger Story this Would Have Been a Must See.Still it is Entertaining.
2,Not a good book for HTML,"The book was written for absolute beginners. It assumes the readers don't know anything about the web. It is not a good reference at all. Everything was written in an essay-like format; it makes it very hard to spot or even find tag names or key words. After wasting my time in the first 2 chapters, I am going to buy another book."
5,Nothing could be more beautiful than this movie,"This movie is so breathtaking, subtle, symbolic, beautiful, spiritual that I am having difficulty writing this. Nothing I could say does this movie justice.I look at the symbolism woven throughout; which itself dances like a dervish, and my mind recognizes the references; and the sheer genius of it's composition. But my heart reacts in a way no intellectual concept could label or classify. Every moment there is another unfolding,,,,This movie is what Islam is REALLY about. It is a Sufi tale; the beauty of Islam taken to its furthest reaches. This movie takes you into the realm where one sees with one's heart, by the Light of God. Eyes are useless there.I can't write anymore,,, There is nothing more to say."
3,Just a seminar..not exercise dvd,"I wasn't exactly sure what was on this dvd, so I bought it to find out. It is a seminar & Q&A session, not an exercise dvd like I was hoping. It's got a lot of good info..but you can get the same info in his books."
4,I think this will grow on me,"I was intrigued to hear her interpretation or inspired product from ""The Words"" . . . . I've spun it twice and I like it. . . . I don't ""love it"" yet but I might.I've great respect for her work, this is different, very much more ""rock"" than any other of her projects. . . .But still very characteristically Rickie Lee, if a more mature and perhaps austere Rickie Lee. . . ."
2,interesting idea falls short,"I felt the ""Sermon"" was a great idea.. the Gospel according to Rickie Lee. The lyrics are compelling and filled with that wonderful poignant, poetic Rickie Lee touch, but the music seemed like an afterthought. It just didn't interest me very much, and did not stay with me. the DVD was so boring, I couldn't get through the whole thing.Maybe that was her idea, to just set a story to music, but I much prefer her other albums with songs that are memorable and singable."
2,"I want to like Rickie Lee like I enjoyed Pirates, but this is not even close.","I want to like Rickie Lee like I enjoyed Pirates, but this is not even close. Disappointing overall."
3,I miss the magic !,"I own everything Rickie has recorded and think she is one of the most talented musicians on the planet. Her debut album, and Pirates were two of the best albums I have ever heard. I miss the great writing, orchestrations and great playing of some of the worlds finest musicians ( Steve Gadd, Chuck Findley etc. ) I hope she can find it in herself to come full circle and create the kind of magic that she used to."
2,Grunge meets Gospel Beat Poetry-- For Jones SuperFans Only,"I can respect the artistic integrity of something and still not care to listen to it...Such is the case with this release. It sounds as if Rickie Lee Jones is channeling Allen Ginsburg (if he had stumbled into an evangelical meeting), backed by some teenagers having their third garage band rehearsal. The sound is raw, the melodies often sparse, and in short, nothing like you would find on something like ""Traffic from Paradise"". If free form grunge or religious theme experiments are your bag, knock yourself out, but for me, I'll put ""Stewarts Coat"" back on my stereo, wish I'd been more careful before I spent money on this, and wait for her next release."
2,jangly unpleasant,"I love rickie's music, especially ""evening"" and ""traffic"", even ""ghostyhead"" is more palatable than this mess. Maybe it's the obnoxious music that is obscuring the usual beauty of her voice and poetry... I don't know. It is harder to find the moments of beauty and cohesion in this album than to sit through drunken kareoke. Even amazon's attempt at offering soundbytes with selling points is rough. I guess I'll just do as another reviewer is, stash this unpleasantness and await her next recording."
1,I love Rickie but...,this cd is just plain weird. I've only listened to it once and am trying to gather the nerve to play it again.
1,Only buy it for the packaging.....,"Talk about one-hit wonders. This disc was so discordant that I could only stand about one-half of one song before I shut it off and hid it away, just in case one of my kids tried to play it someday. Even the lyrics were self-indulgent. When will indies understand that there must be SOMETHING for another HUMAN BEING to connect with, whether it be the music or the words. Don't make us work so hard to like you, Rikkie."
4,ADEQUATE PLUS,NP USA is adequate for the price but more colors would be helpful.Land vs. water is same color. You get used to it after a while but it could be a problem for the inexperienced or disoriented user.I used it for Lake Superior around the Keweenaw. Had just enough and accurate info for my use. Overall I am glad I purchased it. No regrets
2,Poor Excuse,Help links don't work for tutorials. Roads about 100 yds off to side of actual road. Tech support useless.
3,explains deeply but still vague,if i wasnt rushed to read it i probably could've focused on the details and the parallelism. but that's why i'm here cuz i'm tryin to understand it better.
4,I love it!,"Alright, so it's another REO compilation album, but since no UK record shops sell REO singles, and very few sell their albums, I would never have heard 'Just For You' and 'Till the Rivers Run Dry' if it weren't for this album. ( I didn't get hold of a copy of this album until 2001!!)Too many reviewers are whining about the 'sappiness' of this album, but as the liner notes clearly say, 'The Ballads' is just one chapter of the history of REO Speedwagon. The UK release has the original Keep on Loving You (not Reggae version as some reviewers commented on) The whole album is great for those chill out sessions, or just to have on in the house. And for anyone who doesn't like this band or this album, go back to your childish hip-hop (c) rap. 'The Ballads' - I love it!"
4,I like it!,"I heard Can't Fight This Feeling, Keep On Loving You, and Take It On the Run on the radio and I liked them so I bought this CD and though I don't like every song on it I mainly bought the CD for those 3 songs so I can't complain and I'm glad that I bought the CD."
2,Too Many Sappy Songs,"While there are some great songs on here, this CD is an example of too much of a good thing going bad. It is actually hard to listen to the whole album in a sitting... Kevin Cronin whines out one love song after another! The 2 new songs by Cronin are sappy, cliche, and just plain bad. While the CD has great songs like ""Take It On the Run"" and ""Can't Fight This Feeling"", you can also find them on ""The Hits"". I would avoid this album and get ""The Hits"" or ""Second Decade of Rock & Roll""... they have the right blend of rock and ballads, unlike this CD!"
1,Buy It Now For Someone You Hate!,"Pop Kulcher Review: Heard it from a friend who heard it from a friend who heard it from another that this is one unbelievably bad collection of music. I guess calling it ""Songs That Made An Entire Generation Of Radio Listeners Jump Up And Change The Station"" wouldn't have gone over well."
1,"When you find these guys' reproductive organs, return them please.","At one time, REO was a darn good band. Somewhere along the way, they made a very bad decision to go radio pop and ditch their rock and roll (or rock and rollish) roots. This CD is a collection of songs that reflect the worst pieces of music this band ever created. It is very sad. They really could have been a great band if they had followed their guts instead of listening to some producer/label guy who told them to go pop with cheesy love ballads that appear to be written by some heartbroken college freshman.This CD represents the emasculation of a rock and roll band. Any male who buys this should never ever be allowed to reproduce."
4,When The Stars Go Blue,"Since the 1980's, many rock bands developed the triumph of the power ballad. Out of all of them, none have done it any better than REO Speedwagon. Throughout the 80's, they still continue to develop influences into Rock n' Roll.The 1999 album, The Balads is hardly like a greatest hits collection. Nonetheless, the songs here seem to be as just as strong as it was the early 80's all over again. The album includes lesser-known songs that still showcase the music of Kevin Cronin and company, like Building The Bridge, the theme for Former President Clinton's re-election, and After Tonight. The album also includes some of their massive hits, Keep On Loving You, Can't Fight This Feeling, and Take It On The Run.Although REO Spedwagon was never able to recapture their glory days as a rock group, the music will always be savored for years to come, and power balladeers in the making."
4,A good book for a beginer.,"This is an exelent little book for someone who wants to build a log cabin. It will explane all the basics to the beginer who is considering building one of these to live or to have a little camp in the woods. It shows you just about all you need to know in order to build one-even if you have allmost no money,a point I myself find quite helpfull,so all you ""back to the lander's "" should have it on your book shelf. It is plane and to the point and more importantly it willshow you diferent ways to get things underway it was writen by a couple who did this themselves and know all the pit falls. I highly recomend it. I am planing to get another copy for my self (mines all worn out!)."
3,I have not received this book.,"I cannot really rate this book, as I have not received it. I am looking very forward to reading it."
1,"Such a long, dark book!",I quickly lost interest in the constant description of those terrible times.....had to put it down before finishing it. I don't read to be saddened at this stage of my life.
2,Disappointing,"My parents lived through the dust bowl in western Kansas. My dad told the most amazing stories. I had hoped to revitalize my dad's memory with this book, but the start is so slow, I am having a hard time picking it up again. This is how slow it is, James Herriott is my alternative read and it seems action packed. Ha ha! Well, I will get through it someday but today is not that day!"
4,The worst hard time,"this is an excellent book (I have read it before and lived through the period), However, I have not received this order. Can you check on it?"
5,the worst hard time,"loved it, really explains the terrible hardships people of the dust bowl endured. Anyone who enjoys american history will greatly appreciate this book."
5,history lesson,"This was very informative and learned a lot about the era when my parents were young. I was amazed at how that time, 1929 forward paralleled the times we are living in many ways. History repeats itself!"
5,I loved this book so much that I bought it four times!,"My mother's stories of growing up in western Kansas during the dust bowl were almost unbelievable until I read ""The Worst Hard Time"". Her tales of using a rope to feel her way from home to school and placing damp rags around windows and doors to keep down the dust in the house were not the exaggerations I had thought them to be. Timothy Egan recounts the stories of those who lived through this time with vivid detail. He also explains the reasons for this disaster. Many of the factors which brought about the dust bowl are present today so I hope Mr. Egan's journalism will bring greater awareness to us while we can still avoid repeating this tragedy. I finally bought a copy for my Kindle because I had given a friend my copy to read three different times and even at Amazon prices this could not continue. This is a book that you will find yourself thinking about long after you have finished it and you will want to reread it, maybe more than once."
5,worst hard times,One of the best books I've ever read on the dust bowl. Worth the time to read. IT REALLY TAKES YOU TO THE WIND HOWLING and the dust coming through the cracks in the walls.
4,A good historical novel,I found the story compelling. The author went into great detail of the events of this terrible storm in Americas' history.At times there may have been too much repetition. Overall a good read.
4,a reminder about nature and economy,"This is an essential reading. We get occasional reminders on nature'seffects on human lives. Sometimes, it's in our hands to prevent orreduce these effects. This is one example where lack of conservationhas led to loss of livelihood and lives. On the other hand, it's alsoa summary of a ""gray period"" in American history when the economywas at its worse. A reminder, how fast ones world may turn around!"
4,Relating with parents of the Dust Bowl,I've heard stories from our parents on the dust bowl but just here and there. This was an amazing story about several families that not only lived through the dust bowl but how they lived. I never realized what static electricity the dust created and the damage it could do. I'd highly recommend this book for anyone wanting a better feel for the dust bowl days.
5,"Excellent, but not available on Kindle","This book was on my wish list for a while before I was ready to actual read it. By the time I was ready, it was no longer available. I had to check it out of the library. But this is definitely a book I would have happily purchased. It is an engaging account of the Dust Bowl told through the stories of those who lived through it. It almost read like a novel. Worth reading. Worth owning. Too bad not available on Kindle."
5,well written,"I learned a great deal from this book and I thought I knew a fair amount about the dust bowl. Egan's novel-like writing always makes history much more palatable, and the various families' stories illustrated the day-to-day and then year-to-year struggles of ordinary people."
3,History we should not forget,"Timothy Egan does a wonderful job of personalizing the era of the dust bowl by following the lives of real people and their daily lives as the events unfolded. As I read the book I felt covered in dust myself and needed a glass of water close by while I struggled along with the people in the situations presented by the wind and drought conditions. Thanks, Tim for educating me. Let us not forget this valuable lesson."
5,I love History,I do not remember reading much about the Dust Bowl when I was in school. I found this book so fascinating I had a hard time putting it down. It was one of our book club choices and I'm so glad a member made this choice. I bought it for my Kindle and so wanted my husband to read this since we are farmers too. I just had to buy it for him in paperback to take on vacation because I'm reading another book on my Kindle at this time.
3,"Engaging, informative work when he sticks to the facts","Very interesting book charting the 'dirty thirties'. Soil erosion issues mirror what happens in Africa, so this aspect was intriguing. The writing is spotty -- soaring at times but often dipping into a hagiography of FDR. The writer is at his best when telling the stories of survivors."
5,The Worst Hard Time,"Previously to reading this book I had very little knowledge regarding the ""dust bowl"". This book was so informative and really held my attention. I learned a lot about the people and their determination to make a go of it, even when circumstances were hard. I really enjoyed the book."
4,The Worst Hard Times,"Very informative and factual. Interesting learning the cause and effect relationship established by the author. I liked it, probably because I was left some pictures of a wind storm during the dust bowl by my dad who was a survivor."
5,Heart-felt history,"""The Worst Hard Time"" is one of the most moving stories of history I have ever read. It left me with a much clearer understanding of the time and circumstances of the Dust Bowl, but more importantly, I feel I understand the people who survived it better. An awesome tale, well told."
5,The nightmare of blowing wind and dust comes to life,"The author explores the settling of the southern plains in the early 1900s and the farming methods used to turn grasslands into a wasteland. When the drought of the late 1920s and 1930s comes, the Dust Bowl was created. This book follows several families who only wanted a small piece of land for themselves and their families. The reality of living day after day in the nightmare of blowing wind and dust comes to life in this National Book Award winner."
3,"OK book, could have been shorter","The book covers an interesting topic, the Dust Bowl. It explains the events that led to the Dust Bowl and what it was like for people living through it. It was strange to consider that people were living in such primitive conditions in America twenty years before I was born. The book did a good job of explaining how people coped with the dust and what the government did about it. The only problem was the book dragged on for too long. It moves chronologically through the Dust Bowl and there is only so much to say from one year to the next. Also, that actual solutions to the problem seemed to be glossed over, with more emphasis on the misery and politics. Finally, I wish it had more pictures or at least bigger pictures. I went and found some on the Internet, but it would have been nice if they were more prominent in the book."
2,I'm having the worst hard time getting through this book,"The first 100 pages could be told easily in 10 pages, it seems to be basically drilling in the same overall point over and over again and I still haven't even reached a dust storm yet. Based on other reviews here, it sounds like the first 100 pages are the best pages and that the rest of the book drags, so based on that, I don't think I can go on anymore. I would appreciate it more if there were more human story told. The author does include some human story, but he doesn't really develop any characters very deeply, not enough to get me hooked at least."
4,This book lived up to its title!!!!,"Today when we think of hard times-it's the television hasn't worked for three days-we've only been to McDonald's once this week-we haven't had air-conditioning for five days-I had a flat tire this morning on the way to work etc. This book tells us in graphic terms what real hardship is and what our forebears have lived with, even within my lifetime.I was born in 1924, and I remember hearing about the ""dust bowl"" and what was happening out west. With no television, attending movies very rarely, so not seeing ""Movietone News"" reels and little other news coverage I had no idea of the lives these people were living. For anyone interested in what it was truly like in the 1920-30's this is an inexpensive book to read, with superb documentation of the facts."
3,Should have been a great book,"This was an amazing time in our country's history, and the the story of the dust bowl should be particularly compelling. Unfortunately, Egan's writing ability is not up to the task. He tells the story through the eyes of a few brave people who lived through it, yet we never really get to know them. Nor does he do much to explain the larger political and social context in which the ""nesters"" were living. Even though the writing (and lack of editing) was disapointing, this book is still worth reading. Egan does give the reader a taste of what the dust bowl was like. For those of us who remember it only as a three paragraph section in our social studies book, this will help round out a missing part of our education."
2,The Worst of Times.,This book was not what I expected. Thought it would have more of a story line but it was more of a history lesson.Found it to be repetious.
5,Review of worst Hard Time,"Received quickly. It was in very good condition. I have read it before, and enjoyed it.I haven't had time to read it again."
3,BUYER BEWARE - FORMAT!!!,"This may be a good book, but I wouldn't know because my car's CD player won't read this format!For whatever RIDICULOUS reason, this is encoded for MP3 only, and cannot be played as a regular CD.Worthless."
2,Boring and slow....,Are all National Book Award winners this bad? Wait. Paco's Story is worse. This is a 300 page book that should have been 50 pages. It just drags and drags and drags....
1,Can't seem to get through this one,"Found this book very tough to get through...I still have not succeeded. It is a heavy, cumbersome read...not at all smooth and engaging. Very disappointed."
2,Great History - Poor Language,"I ordered this book and found the first few chapters fascinating, history wise. Then the vulgarity and profanity turned me off. Has Mr. Egan ever heard of TMI (too much information?) We can all assume that many of the cowboys around Dalhart looked for loose women, but who wants to read about the baser nature when they think they're picking up a good history book? I don't necessarily believe in censorship, but I do believe in MY right to censor what I read and, sadly, I personally censored this book."
3,A subject better served in novel form.,"There wasn't enough here for a book. And it was too much for a single magazine article. (A series, maybe?) I found 'Worst Hard Time' lost its effectiveness at various points, made getting to the end more of a chore than I'd expected. However...However, because I was totally unaware of this aspect of American history, my fascination with what Egan was relating, sustained me.Aside from this, what I most got from reading the book was the haunting correlation between what was effected on the land back in the 30s (mindless arrogance, ignorance and pig-headedness) and the Wall Street meltdown of 2008. For me, this poignancy alone made it worth reading.This is a stunning tale. Riveting in parts, depressing all throughout. Perhaps the most sobering element of all was this: 'Man never learns.' (And I used the term 'Man' intentionally, rather than 'humankind') Because I'd like to think we can learn something from the lessons Egan presents...but I doubt it."
2,Worst Hard Time,I am reading this for my book club. Reads like a history book. I am having the worst hard time getting through it.
4,great american story,told about people living through some of the worst times in American history. Eating tumbleweed and dying from dust in their lungs. Well written by an accomplished author.
4,Dust Bowl,"The book was hard to put down, even though the story is depressing and dark. But then, that describes the era, and Egan's title is right on. I recommend Timothy Egan's dust bowl day book if you are looking for something on that time period in American history."
4,well written and timely message,"An era I knew little of, but the message of bad govt. policy and greed both resonant in todays society. It happened for a lot of reasons but our belief we are smarter than nature was the biggest!"
5,A Must Read!!,Do not pass the opportunity to read this book. An insightful journal of lost and forgotten times in our country's earlier times.
4,Excellent Dust Bowl description,"Excellent history of the Western US Dust Bowl conditions of the 1920's and 1930's. The author describes the events leading up the the start of the dust bowl conditions and gives vivid and detailed descriptions of individuals and families and how they lived and survived in the horrible wind driven dust storms in Western Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Colorado. I have to believe the the author either read diaries and journals of those people or else talked to them because the descriptions are detailed and real. Just hearing about dust storms doesn't prepare the reader for the actual conditions and poverty that people had to endure. It is difficult to believe that anyone actually stayed as the storms and the drought and the poverty lasted for many years. If I were to improve the book I would add more photos. There are only a few and they are small."
4,Those who don't know history...,"My family stayed in Hooker, Oklahoma during the dustbowl (see the index re. the largest rabbit drive ever in Hooker). After reading the book, I asked my self: Why did my ancestors endure this hell?This book brought home the desperate times faced by Okies during the dustbowl. It also provides an ecological warning: abuse nature at your own risk. She will have her revenge.On the downside, the author drifed a bit about midway through. The book could have been about 20-40 pages shorter. I blame that on the editor more than the author."
3,A must for our History,"I thought this was a great read. It told the stories of the hard times so well. The things these poor families went through, truly amazing. I felt as if I was there after reading this."
3,Good but long,"This book has great information and I'm glad I read it. I learned a lot. However, there were so many characters that I had a hard time keeping track. Also, it became redundant toward the end and I found myself skimming."
5,Americans need to know,I read this from the public library and knew I had to own it.I want all my family to read it.We Americans need to know our history and what shapes our times.In this case specifically the Midwest.
3,informative,"I enjoy the produce, that being the Kindle reader and the delivery of the printed word electronicallyThe author gives a very descriptive narrative of what the `dust bowl` years were like....He must have exaggerated to a degree as I could not imagine subjecting my family and myself to such extreme hardship-nor a person not being able to know what `mother nature` was doing to them health wise.. I do not mean to convey that I do not have great empathy for the pioneers themselves..The author did a thorough back ground research, and the book `hard times` by Dak(sp)trow . was imo, also a very thorough book, and had a broader base of what was the `depression` Tony."
4,Great Read!,"This book is extremely well written. Although it is a history of the Dust Bowl, the story flows like a great historical fiction novel. It is impossible not to become completely absorbed in the accounts of those who survived, and died during this period in American history. I loved the back story; the author paints in vivid detail a picture of the events leading up to the Dust Bowl, and how it could have been prevented. The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars is that it ends quite abruptly, and I would have liked more detail in the epilogue. Other than that minor detail this book is most definitely worth the time and money."
4,"Worst Hard Time, the best read!","Very well written. The description is unrelenting, as indeed it certainly was for those who lived through it. I was born in 1933 to parents who had only recently escaped ,with my older sister, from Oklahoma. They never talked about it, but this book does. Bravo!"
4,The Worst Hard Time:The untold Story of Those who Survived the great American Dust Bowl,"When I saw this book listed on Amazon's available reads, I was immediately interest as I have known a lady who as a young girl stood on their porch in Kansas and saw the dust coming in. This book goes beyond the dust bowl and tells of the settling of the Kansas, Texas, Oklahoma ""no man's land"". I really don't remember being taught much about this time except highlights of the time. My Father's people came from Prussia in 1863, but settled in IL, LA. I didn't realize how much the Russian Germans contributed to developing the dust bowl areas. The author doesn't particularly dwell on people relations except in the contributions they made as groups. The book is narrative more than story. The land and natural disasters are the protagonists. It isn't a fun read, but it is well worth a ""real life"" read of our past history. There is no plot. It is a slow read , even for me. I usually read very quickly."
4,The Worst Hard Time,"Timothy Egan has a way of involving the reader in his stories. By the time he has introduced you to all of the key players you find that you can identify with one or more in that you could see yourself in their shoes. In this case we are drawn to the potential for great wealth in the rich,until then,unfarmed areas of Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. We feel the joys of the boom times and the unbelievable loss as the Great American Dust Bowl literally blows away their dreams. And you find yourself asking ""what would I do next"". It's a gripping true story of human grit.It's a very good read!"
3,Worst Hard Tim,A good book but seems to go into details about unrelated topics rather than just the stories on the dust bowl
3,Very interestig time in American History,"I found the topic extremely interesting. I've always been aware of the ""dust bowl"" and that it happened during the depression. But I had no idea of it's magnitude. By magnitude I mean how much territory it affected and the horrors the dust storms inflicted on the people, their animals and property. While the content was interesting I must admit that it was a very slow read. But worth it nonetheless."
4,A cautionary tale,"Growing up near the center of the Dust Bowl region, I heard many stories from old folks who experienced those terrible times first hand. Timothy Egan has done a good job of collecting similar stories from a handful of survivors. The book has an authentic ring to it and is an enjoyable thought provoking read for the most part. My only kick is that Egan's flashback narrative style seemed repetitive at times, but I strongly recommend this book both to those interested in the history of this region, and to anyone concerned about farming techniques and the future of our environment."
2,Well written but actually pretty boring,"Wow, I love American history and I love farming. But this is one of the most boring books I have muddled through in a long time. He developed the setting very well and built the characters so that the reader would know them personally. But as he recounted storm after storm, the book dragged on and on much like the Dust Bowl and Depression themselves. Honestly, the storms weren't much differnt from one another, so giving us a detailed account of each one was monotonous."
3,"Interesting book, but silly errors","The author has no experience with the people or farming landscape he discusses. His mistakes are not huge errors of fact, but lead me to question the reliability of his other statements. He has a farm family desperate to reach Oklahoma stop to bury a dead horse. Highly unlikely. He refers to an ""internal combustion plow."" No such thing. Completely misunderstands the reason cattle are forced through a dipping vat (to kill parasites, not to kill the cow!) These little sour notes detract from what is otherwise an engrossing book about the ""Dirty Thirties."""
2,Every chapter starts sounding like the previous.,"Liked: Great writing style, interesting informationDisliked: All the stories sound the same after you read 2 or 3 accounts, and then it keeps going on.I wanted to like this book, and found the first 60 or so pages very interesting, but then the next chapter seemed to be quite the same, and now 1/2 way though the book, every chapter is the same. It has different people, but then its more of the same.I will say I learned a lot in the 1/2 of the book (never knew the dust spread all the way to New York and that the digging up of native grass caused much of the problem) and feel for those that lived through it, but I stopped when the stories all began to run together. I think it might have worked better for me had he just chosen 2 or 3 accounts. I'll probably finish it, but every chapter I hope to see it going somewhere, but its just another similar story about a family stuck in the dust bowl."
4,You Can Almost Taste the Dust,Egan's technique of interweaving the stories of families and towns that stayed in the regions hardest hit by the Dust Bowl--particularly Texas and Oklahoma--puts the reader so close to the drama you can almost taste the dust. The horrors of the dust bowl make most Hollywood enviro-disaster films look like nursery school.
4,Very informative,In depth depiction of the dust bowl and the people who stayed and the hell they lived through...good read if you like history.
5,Very well written documentary,This book describes the devastation of the soil and desperation of the pioneers during the Dust Bowl years in such an engaging fashion that you feel like it might have happened to a close friend or relative.
4,The Best of the Worst Hard Time,"I never knew much about the real hardship of the ""Dirty 30's"" and this book was such an eye opener of what these prairie families endured and how they actually managed to survive this period. The first hand accounts were much more interesting than most fiction. The role the government played in bringing about the disaster of raping the earth and then the FDR administration struggling to ""fix"" it so the hardworking farmers could once again make a humble living, was inspiring. This should be a must read for all agricultural students and the greedy ""farm companies"" because I certainly can not imagine that our world today will survive another dust bowl."
4,Amazing examples of human fortitude!,"So tragic. Some very interesting American history....but, too many pages with repetive scenarios. Felt like I might be reading the same chapter over... at times."
4,Good historical book,"I knew very little about the dust bowl of the 1930s. This book delved into real people's lives and told the story as they experienced it. It is also a very political book in how the dust bowl came to be and how they tried to fix it and about how America faces farming even today. I feel it should be a must read in high school or college to understand the mind set of the late 19th century and into the 20th.The author made me feel what it must have been like to have the earth ""rain"" dirt down on those settlers/farmers."
3,good information but got repetitive.,Good book on how much the people suffered and what they went through to survive the dust storms. Gives you a good feel of how their daily life went. Unfortunately the dust storms lasted for six years which made for some repetitive discriptions as the years passed in the book. If I got tired of reading about the storms I can't imagine how hard it must have been living through them year after year. Saying that it was still worth reading.
4,Hard Times on the Great Plains,This was an interesting and informative non fiction book about the Dust Bowl of the 1930's. It was a good companion to the Ken Burns film currently showing on PBS. The book actually enhanced the film and gave much more detail about things never covered in the film.
5,history,A great history of a time I knew little about. The suffering of these Americans is unimaginable and totally unnecessary.
2,RTWyman,"I enjoyed this books coverage of individuals and the construction of the history of how the disaster came to be. I struggled with the use of contemporary language/slang on occasion with the story, phrasing out of place and not yet in use during the historical timeline covered. There is endless jumping around of stories and undeveloped detail with each of them. It simply became frustrating. I will not recommend the book, not on behalf of the author but on the fact that a National Book Award was granted."
5,The Worst Hard Time: The Untold Story of Those Who Survived the Great American Dust Bowl,"I borrowed this from the Kindle Owner's Lending Library and finished it in two days. It is extremely well written and moves as quickly as one of the dust storms across the Southern Plains. The moral of this story, to paraphrase an old margarine commercial, is: ""It's not nice to fool (around with) Mother Nature."""
4,"Wonderful history, but enough is enough","This a great history of a forgotten time. A time for those who lived through it, they wish they could forget. The author starts out by incorporating in his text slang words from the 1930's era which only helps to put you right there. He skillfully weaves into his history the lives of five families and carries them through the eight-year drought that created the Dust Bowl. I would have given this book another star, if the author could have somehow used some different words to describe the daily incessant brownies and blackies of the dusters. The descriptions become as boring as the skies and ground, brown and nondescript. These non-descriptions tend to extend the history infinitem, though I am sure to live it was a day after day struggle. Thank goodness he picks up the five familes during their continuing downturns to break up the monotony. An excellent read none the less."
3,The Worst Hard Time,"I wanted to read this because this was a time in United States history I knew nothing about. Reading it was a downer, so sad. There were parts of the book that were very difficult to get through, rather boring and repeatious."
5,The Worst Hard Time goes beyond any history we were taught in school.,"The Worst Hard Time relates the history of the dust bowl across the great plains in such a manner that you feel you might be living in the time. You become aware of the magnitude of the event and the suffering of the many people living in the area.The book describes how the prairie lands in the Heartland of America were destroyed It faults the government, bad farming practices and greed on the part of most involved. A draught of many years followed the ruin of the ground cover.It then goes on to show the fortitude of men determined to live out thier lives on the prairie despite the hardships, and make it a productive and livable place. A very compelling work. Goes way beyond what we learned in history class in school."
4,History at it's best.,This was a great read. A nice combo of history and those who lived it. Too bad history class wasn't this interresting!
4,The Worst Hard Time,"Promise, hope, success, and failure combined to learn hard lessons. Being raised in the Texas Panhandle I appreciate this bit of history. I encounterd a few dust storms in the early 40's and remembered the havoc they caused even then."
4,Fascinating reading,"Kind of slow-reading at first but totally fascinating once you really get into it. I was really shocked when I realised my parents lived through it - just in the Vernon - Wichita Falls area. Pickled tumbleweed? I'll never look at one the same! I live in Amarillo, Tx."
4,Great History of a Difficult Time,"Graffic (and sometimes hard to read) renditions of various families who lived through the ""dust bowl"" era in north Texas, western Oklahoma and southern Colorado."
3,"Jaggy, abrupt and inept use of timeline storytelling","I've read about half of the book - and I must admit, it's a compelling read, as I read all those pages in less than a day - but I'm practically dizzy from Egan's constant popping back and forth in time. One page it's January 1932. Next page is back to July 1930 - page after that maybe Spring of 1932.... to aggravate matters, his locations change constantly - so it makes for a somewhat confusing read.I heard Mr. Egan on NPR and he made a comment about how ""Grapes of Wrath"" was about people who LEFT - this book was about people who stayed - but, as a previous reader commented - he has BARELY fleshed out these real people - motivations are vaguely outlined, and he has failed to bring these (again - REAL) people to life. Steinbeck created the Jodes from imagination, Egan's got the clear advantage, yet missed the mark.Nonetheless, a must-read for anybody who ever reads about this part of the country - especially any McMurtry fan."
3,Okay,"The first chapters were a little annoying. The last paragraph of each ended the same sort of way, warning how the residents did not know what horrible thing was coming. I have to say, ""Of course they didn't."" I do not need to be told this over and over again. I as the reader know that something bad is going to happen otherwise there would not have been a dust bowl about which I am reading. Once I started skipping those refernces, I enjoyed the book. The discriptions of life during the years of the dust bowl were good. It would have been nice to have more of an understanding of when the worst ended and things got better but that was missing from the end."
4,Dust Bowl Details,"Like a looming duster, open the pages of this book and it will engulf you.I'm familiar with farming and American history. I thought I knew all about the Dust Bowl. Not even close. Timothy Egan's details of the Dust Bowl come at you as if wind-driven.The what, where, why, when, and how are fully explored. What makes this book good is the attention given to who was involved in the Dust Bowl. They all seem to be here. The culprits--both the greedy and the ignorant. The desperate and the well-meaning. The victims and their terrible suffering. And the heroic.This book seems especially relevant given concerns over Global Warming and the disastrous consequences that some say are coming.I'm a little disappointed by the manner used to cite references. It would have been a more effective book if conventional footnotes had been inserted. It is awkward sorting through the disconnected Notes and Sources section."
5,Fascinating Read,"Most of us weren't even born when the Great Dust Bowl happened. The history of the plains and the terrible destruction done to it is appalling, but fascinating! The photographs included will haunt you as well. I bought this book for my permanent library and I will reread it - sometime I seldome do."
4,The Worst Hard Time,Amazing story of how the early settlers made it through the Dust Bowl days. A tough lesson in messing with mother nature and the land we live in. Didn't realize so many people remained in that area thoughout and after the devistation.
4,"A bit of a slow start, but well worth the read","Though it is nonfiction, this book contains all the qualities I look for in a historical novel - vivid imagery, fast-moving plot, engaging characters. It chronicles the fallout of one of the worst man-made environmental disasters in history - the Dust Bowl. Using his journalistic skills, Egan transforms research, data and interviews into a page-turning tale of devastation, tenacity, endurance, redemption and optimism. Story telling at its best."
4,"Review of ""The Worst Hard Time""",The book was purchased for my wife. It arrived in good condition and in a timely manner. She is enjoying the book
5,Awesome!!!!,I've been using this brand for years. I take it at the first sign of a cold or sore throat and I never get very sick at all. Natural antibiotic!!!! I have tried other brands and they don't work.
2,Invicta men's made in usa collection automatic watch 3497,I am sorry to report that I am not happy with this watch at all. After just two weeks the watch stopped. I would apprecaite if the products I buy from amazon worked properly.
5,We love it!,"My twin three year old girls love all the Ice Age movies. I bought this Christmas special and was not disappointed. My girls laugh and laugh at the ""naughty squirrel"" trying to get the acorns."
4,Only 30 min,"Super cute movie, especially if your child is an Ice Age fan. Really short though, only 30 minutes. Overall a cute short flick to add to your christmas collection."
5,My 8 year old loves this!,We have all of the ice age movies and was excited to find a Christmas storyline! Short but sweet and a nice change from the usual holiday specials. We'll add this to our Christmas viewing list each year!
4,Short but Sweet,"Very cute, will be a Christmas regular watch. Can't help but smile your way through it. Equally as enjoyable as the old Charlie Brown Christmas cartoon."
5,$5 short film,I bought this because it was only $5 dollars. It's really just a short Christmas film. I don't think it's worth the $5 dollars. I have Netflix and could have watched something else for free.
5,it is going to be a present,I purchased this DVD for a Christmas present for my nephews. They have seen other Ice Age movies and thought they would love this one. I can not tell you how they liked it as of yet.
2,Not so Merry Christmas,"This should have been attached to a full length movie as a plot point as part of a feature film; as an extra to a movie or extended into a longer movie. Not up to the Ice Age franchise standards. There is nothing special, different or even funny about this movie. It never gets up to speed and the ending leaves you flat."
2,Can't say much,There wasn't enough material for one to really get into the movie and enjoy iti think the best part was the squirrel (which always lasts 1-2 minutes)
2,"20min. movie, do not order if you exspect full 60 min. movie","A 20min. clip not a movie, very dissapointed, it is not worth the money!!it should be advertised as movie clip, not movie!!"
2,rip off,"it was a rip-off. just bits and pieces of the movie. Wasn't worth the money charged, it should have been a freebie. Don't waste your money on this."
3,Could has been better!,It could has been better for $8. The length of time and the story line are not worth $8. Half the price may be.
3,Ice Age: A Mammoth Christmas,I was a little disappointed in this movie. I loved all the other Ice Age movies but there was something missing from this one.
2,a very short DVD,"As always, I love the Ice Age antics and voices. I was so excited to find this DVD in time for Christmas. I was then so disappointed to find that the DVD only ran for 25 minutes. Funny and crazy as expected, but ending way too quick."
4,"Very cute Christmas special, but pricey/short","The show is very cute, as the others have said, and there are a few quirks regarding Santa Claus and the sleigh. I bought the BR/DVD/Digital @ Walmart on Black Friday for $8, but I would not have gotten it if I had realized there was only about 20-21 minutes of video. Both of my boys really enjoyed it, as my wife and I did, as well as my mother. It is funny and will crack you up, but definitely don't pay more than $8 for it."
3,Short but entertaining ...and at the right price..,"Don't know why Amazon is selling the non blue ray version more expensive thanthe stores i've seen it in, but at $5 its worth buying. Its not that long butit is good and its a great addition to my animated collection."
3,Cute But Too Short,This movie was cute but personally I felt it was way too short. Would be happier if I could have paid less for it.
4,Enjoyable for all ages,"My family are fans of Ice Age and this dvd was a treat. This was the Christmas Eve gift for my 16 year old son (always given a holiday movie to watch on Christmas Eve) and he was not disappointed. Humorous, original cast, and maintained the holiday spirit...what more would you ask for?"
3,not the longest movie or best,it was ok. the kids liked it just a little short even for 5.00. not sure it was worth the money.
5,Ice Age Christmas,"this was a really cute short and very well suited to children of all ages. We loved it, as didour grandchildren!"
3,Ice Age franchise is starting to melt,I know these little holiday spins-offs are not designed for their wonderful plot but I found this lacking. It did bring back our favorite furry characters but it just feels forced there doesn't seem to be the same play the voice actors have had in the movies. It takes place after the 3rd movie so we see some development of Peaches. Also there is another pack of mini sloths. It's relatively short 26 min. Scrats nut chasing isn't what it used to be. It's cute but not worth 15 dollars if you can get it stuck to another movie or for 5 dollars it might be worth it.
4,very cute!,very Cute! Worked great... I am glad we bought it for our daughter. It was a little shorter than I expected...
1,Dissapointed,"It was more like a review than a movie. We barely got comfortable and it was over. It felt like something was missing. The price was small, but who wants to pay for a review that lasts a few minutes."
4,Cute Story,"All the favorite characters are in this one, including an older Peaches. It was a nice way to bring Santa into the Ice Age."
4,Short but Sweet!,The Ice Age series is good but coming to an end. This is a good Christmas quickie for the kids.
5,Just pure fun,"Gave this to our daughter for Christmas. During the lull in activities we put it on rather then watching basketball. This is so funny! Great for all ages, brought family together for laughs."
2,Ehh...,I am not too impressed with this movie. The story is not that I expect coming from the iceage films. It is very weak and my kid did not really care for it either.
5,Ice Age,"So cute! Great humour, good for any age :D I love Scrat, unfortunately he still doesn't really get a happy ending - hopefully next Christmas!"
4,cute and fun,This video has both English and Spanish sound tracks and my daughter (5) and I both enjoyed it. It's not a feature-length movie so don't expect it to give you a full evening's entertainment but it's fun and harmless.
2,"SHORT, but good Blu-Ray","Excellent 1080p Blu-Ray animation and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.TWO STARS BECAUSE FEATURE IS ONLY 25 MINUTES LONG.You would think they should have marketed it as ""A 'Short' Christmas Special"" or ""A Mammoth Christmas 'Short'"" because it is only half a movie.Did I mention the movie is only 25 minutes long?"
1,Ice Age Christmas Special,"We had no problem with the supplier/seller of this product. We were disappointed in the content. It was standard affair with the Christmas story being told... the tree, Santa, reindeer, etc. The problem is that the movie is only 5 minutes long. DON'T BOTHER! It's not worth the money."
1,It was bad,This was bad. It was a waste of time. It was an embarrassment. It made no sense . . . The Ice Age was BC . . . that is the first clue. Even if you over come that issue there is nothing redeeming in this video. Even . . . no . . . especially for children there are so many better video for them to see. This was just exploiting the Ice Age characters.
3,Redesigned by lawyers,"The original Thingmaker had a real burner. Children poured the plastic goop into moulds, and placed them on the hot surface. They had to observe them and make sure they were cooked through, and then lift them out of the Thingmaker with tongs and move them to a bath of cold water to cool off.This was educational on multiple levels. It taught all sorts of lessons, from patience, to basic industrial processes, to proper respect for the stove and the kitchen.This Thingmaker runs with a light bulb. Far fewer moulds come with it than I remember. Worse, the edifying process of cooking the Plastigoop, lifting it out of the burner, and cooling it, has been ""automated"" by a process that locks in the mold until the machine decides it's ready to spit it out. The lesson in patience and observation provided by the original machine is now lost.It definitely seems to have been redesigned by lawyers."
2,"Fun toy, cheap oven","My kids love to make Creepy Crawler bugs but, as other reviews have noted, we have to cook them in our house oven. I think they used the toy oven one time and then the power switch broke and it won't slide all the way to the ""on"" position anymore."
3,Too much safety,"This is essentially the same toy I had as child, but now has been frustrated with 1) the addition of a cheesy door that won't open until the cooker proclaims itself ""cool"" (try leaving it in a Chicago garage in December to speed things up) and 2) a light bulb (NOT INCLUDED!) for cooking for goodnes sake. Not quite the same bug-making experience I had for sure, but our 7 and 5 year old boys, with no such preconceptions, have been delighted with it. I guess that's the bottom line."
1,cheaply made,"The plastic door is cheaply made. The plastic tab that locks the door in place and allows you to cook broke off the very first time we used it. Without that tab, the product won't turn on, so it is useless."
2,Not a good toy for impatient children,"My 5 year old daughter received this toy from a friend for Christmas last year. She thought it was the coolest toy. When we brought the toy home and opened it...there was no bulb, and nowhere open on Christmas to buy one. When we were finally able to get a bulb for the toy the next day, much to her disappointment, it takes approximately 10-12 minutes to ""cook"" the bugs and another 12-15 minutes for the machine to cool down so the door can be opened (safety feature). She was not very happy with having to wait almost a half an hour for one spider to be made. Needless to say, she dosen't play with that toy much now."
2,A Lesson in Patience,"My 5 year old wanted this toy very much. Nobody told me about the flimsy base for the bulb. It took about 15 mins. just to get the lightbulb working. He enjoyed using the goop. Then we had to cook each mold about three times to get it to a somewhat solid form. Then only at the END of the instructions did we read to use only the FX in the legs and arms. Next time we're putting it in the oven. ""Mommy, I'm tired of waiting,"" says Michael over and over again."
1,"Looks fun, but who would know without the lightbulb","O.K. I read all the reviews before buying this toy for my son for xmas; it sounded cool and lots of fun. He was thrilled when he opened the present....but we still have not successfully used it. At this moment there is uncooked goop sitting in a tray because we didn't have the right wattage (or size)light bulb in our house. Every xmas I stock up on AA, AAA, C, D batteries in preparation for xmas, but never did I think about getting a lightbulb that would work in this toy. Why didn't anyone write about this in their reviews, I at least could have been prepared xmas morning. So I don't know how great this toy is until I get the lightbulb."
3,whimsical but gloomy,"This is only the third ""TCW"" book I've read (the others were the first in the series and the one that apparently takes place right after this).Call me crazy, but this book was a little dark for my tastes (a sentiment apparently not shared by the other reviewers so far). The cats are amusing, and even Qwill's unending grumpiness did sort of grow on me, but other things left me feeling uneasy -- particularly the apparent casualness with which the Moose County locals accept a man's violent death, and the depressing twist at the end (and I'm not referring to sudden change in Qwill's fortunes). If this is a cozy, it's sort of a Gothic one."
4,For fun,"The cat who series is a light fun read.The characters are well developed. The books have no sex or, violence their just a fun read."
4,Short and enjoyable,This is my first Lillian Jackson Braun book. Very quick read and entertaining. I love the 2 cats (as I love ALL cats! Qwilleran is a very eccentric character and I found his grumpiness endearing. I will be reading the other books in the series!
4,The wait was well worth it from rap's premier gay group,"Trails are being blazed in the Soul's third album in six years. Bringin' it in '93 with ""93 Til.."" these brothas have busted the stereotype that homosexuals have no place in the rap game. They are not just a novlety act either, as any true hip-hop head ranks them with Wu-Tang as the industry's dopest Clan. Like Marvin said, ""Let me say to you - right on""."
2,worth reading - but see caveat,"The author claims to be a Swami and yet very clearly he is slams other teachers, notably Yogananda and goes even further by providing a list of so called authorised Kriya teachers. Being Indian, he should know much better. However he does bring to light some of the political and predatory aspects of the SRF and similar organisations - worth reading just so that Kriya practitioners don't just accept everything blindly!!! Incidently, lets not forget that the SRF is no better in claiming that they alone have the right to teach Kriya...Go figure!"
4,Go Pokes!,"Great cap. I have a relatively large head for a woman and it fits fine. Bought it before the Fiesta Bowl game, and it's now my lucky hat!"
2,"watch out, parents!","These keys seemed like a cool toy, but my four-and-a-half month old daughter was laying on her stomach and playing with them, and a key went all the way down her throat. All the way. Very scary. I don't think the toy design is flawed, I just think it's something to watch out for."
2,Very dissapointing!,"I love Sassy products, this one was a bummer though. The keys are so long my baby can gag herself with them. No fun! The keys are also plastic, I was hoping there would be some rubber on them since most Sassy toys have that on them.I would skip this toy and get the circle rattle."
2,Not very useful...,"My son likes the clacking noise when I shake the keys, but they are not good for chewing and I don't let him hold them because he poked himself in the eye!"
5,Perfect for the young truck-enthusiast,"I shared this book with a young friend, to watch his reaction as the story unfolds. It's supurb! The opening spread of a man and a boy hauling a heavy suitcase provided the first clue to what the ""five drivers for five trucks"" did every day. The drivers' teamwork, their varied genders and ethnicity, and the care taken in getting the airplane serviced and ready to fly are all well illustrated. Youngsters who have flown or visited airports will especially enjoy this book, and it would be a great addition to carry-on baggage for parents of younger children."
3,One of Brown's weaker efforts,"Fredric Brown wrote some great science fiction. Unfortunately, it does not include Rogue in Space. While I wouldn't be as harsh on this short novel as Mike Smith was (below), I can't honestly give it more than three stars. Except for the settings (Mars, asteroid belt, etc.) this is more of a crime novel than a sci-fi epic. The protagonist, Crag, is an antisocial misfit who hates women and sells his services to the highest bidder. The first half of the book is more interesting than the second, which revolves heavily around Crag's drinking sprees and attempts to get into trouble. And the book's credibility is not enhanced by Brown's often-poor grasp of science -- e.g. two-day trips from Mars to the asteroid belt. Rogue in Space is readable, but well below Brown's two classic SF novels, What Mad Universe and Martians, Go Home."
4,Good but flawed study,"Heather Hendershot does a wonderful job of reviewing Christian conservative media culture and some of what propels it. Her survey of Christian entertainment feels plausible enough that her conclusions are not unreasonable. However, I found her discussion of Evengelical attitudes toward sex incomplete and biased. The chapter, Holy Homosexuals, while interesting hardly belonged with the rest of the book. The other chapter dealing with sexuality only surveyed Focus on the Family publications. It ignored denominational publications - there must be some. I am still not convinced Focus on the Family is representative. These chapters felt like Evengelical books reviewing the beliefs of other religions: here are their beliefs and why they are wrong. Unfourtunately, the editor didn't strongly recommend removing or rewriting these chapters. It would have improved the insight and power of this book. Still, I enjoyed the book, and recommend it."
4,Magellan leather case,Good product but could use a plastic window for the screen and a opening in the back for external hookups.
3,Fine case,It does what it is designed to do. Could have used a plastic window to protect the screen.
3,Not as good as expected,"I would never go as far as comparing Free to any James Patterson! I experienced this book as a rather dull attempt at creating literature. For me, suspense never really built, character developement wasn't too impressive (especially Gabrielle, who I can't imagine anybody ever falling in love with her as she is portrayed)and the plot had attempts of twists and turns, but since the final culprit appeared in along the story, it was easy, really, to figure out what will happen then. I'll admit, Olaia's death came a bit as a surprise, especially since I hoped Sal would ditch that awful Gabrielle and run a way with Olaia :)For me this book was a mediocre one. I've read better, but I've also read worse..."
5,Gets a child to think about basic needs of live creatures!,"I love how the mother and child in this story interact. When the child wants to keep the salamander he found, the mother (instead of saying ""no"" or lecturing him about why we don't take creatures out of their natural habitat) asks him questions that require the child to think about what the salamander needs to sleep, eat, play and more. Step by step the boy imagines how he could meet the salamander's needs, yet still keep it in his room, which is now quickly turning into a woodland paradise for his new friend. This is a wonderful story for all children - especially for the ones who desire to bring home live ""treasures"" from nature to keep in their room!"
3,A Salamanders Home,"In this amazing book for children a young boy named Brian is exploring in a forest and finds a little salamander and takes it home. His mother is worried and keeps asking him how he is going to take care of this extraordinary creature. Well his mother comes up with more and more questions, while Brian keeps coming up with more and more answers.As the story progresses Brian's bedroom begins to change, and the more questions he answers, the more his bedroom changes.Near the end you begin to see what his bedroom is changing into.At the end of the story his bedroom is filled with a multitude of animals and his room is now a forest but he and his salamander friend are happy and tired and they fall asleep.This interesting book was written by: Anne Mazer and illustrated by Steve Johnson."
5,The Salamander Room,I got as a gift. It is a wonderful book and children love it. I was disappointed that I didn't get the edition with a dust jacket as that makes it a more beautiful book.
3,I gave 3 stars because the movie stopped in a part of the movie.,"I saw this movie for my reading class. The movie of LWFC its good but too short, the book has a lot of parts that the movie messed.The movie stopped in the last part of the movie and took to much time for download.But in general the movie was good for the price. I gave 3 stars because Took time downloading when it stopped."
4,Passionate Menu,"If you like food movies, this is a good one. With a creative story line and lots offood and sensuality. I went cookbook shopping after this movie, added more spices to my cupboard, and squeezed in some rose petals here and there.NOW, I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THIS STATEMENT.MOVIE REVIEWS ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO GIVE AWAY THE WHOLE MOVIE. WHY DO SO MANY PEOPLE ON AMAZONDO THAT? A REVIEW IS LIKE A BOOK REPORT....YOU GIVE THE BASICS AND CRITIQUE HOW IT AFFECTED YOU AND WHY YOU DID OR DIDN'T LIKE IT. YOU DON'T WALK SOMEONE THROUGH THE PLOT FROM BEGINNING TO END.HAD TO GET THAT OUT."
2,"Probabley a wonderful movie, if not dubbed","Before I watched this movie, I had read and fell in love with the book. It was magical and enthralling. I'm sure the movie would have been too. Unfortunately when I rented it, I picked up the english dubbed one. The voice actors sounds unnatural and like village idiots. This greatly detracts from the performance of the actors. My advice: READ THE BOOK. And if you want to watch the movie, GET THE ORIGINAL SUBTITLED VERSION and maybe your movie watching experience will be salvaged unlike mine."
3,Glad I saw it...,"I have been curious about this movie for a while. Its a little bizarre, or maybe whimsical is the appropriate word. It was sensual, surprising, and overall very enjoyable. (My husband, on the other hand, couldnt't quite get into it, but he sat through it with me just the same!)"
4,Passion And Mystery,"A wonderfully passionate film with the undertones of the mysterious magic that happens in the heart of the home - the hearth. Reaching out to everyone through comfort and food, bringing them together no matter if they are villainous or pure. Like Water for Chocolate is a wonderful moive on so many levels. I first saw this film as an educational film in Spanish class and fell in love with it."
4,great movie,"I loved this movie about food and two lovers separated by a cruel mother.The book is just as good as the movie.Both talk about a a richfamily in turn of the century Mexico.The star is Tita,who isforced from an early age to never marry and have children because of a family tradition. Instead she has to take of her mother,Mama Elena(read more about her!) and forsake her true love,Pedro."
3,Stunning Mexican movie spoiled by emotionless dubbing,"Like Water for Chocolate is a stunning movie about an early 20th century Mexican girl who suppresses her love for a boy to meet cultural expectations that a family's youngest daughter remain unmarried to care for her aging mother. Forced to repress her love, she channels her passion into cooking for the family. The stylistic features of this movie reminded me of the filmmaking of Fellini. This particular version of the movie was spoiled, in my opinion, by some rather emotionless reading of the parts by the persons hired to dub the film in English. Don't be disappointed -- get the Spanish language, English subtitled version and enjoy the original passion of the film. The Spanish language version rates two more stars, for a total of five."
5,Get the Original,The movie is true to the book. But the Spanish (doubled) as well as the English version sound fake and makes the movie seem incredibly stupid. I recommend the subtitled version (which is no longer made on vhs). Before you watch the movie read the book it is a wonderful experience. Even more for all latin (especialy mexican-american) woman.
5,The best love storys are ...,The best love stories are the ones that make your heartache. The kind that make you feel something for the characters. Like Water for Chocolate is the best love story ever. Set in Old Mexico the movie follows a girl who is in love. It shows her trials with her family and the struggles she has to be with the man who is her obvious soul mate. You will laugh and you will cry and you will LOVE this movie.
4,Romantick and funny,"this film is romantick and funny for yu to see. i think you like this film. it has some romance like in Mexico and has some funny times at the dinner table to. this film, i remember i laugh in Cinema to. this film deserve the four stars. you will see just watch this."
4,Cultural Love Story of Symbolic Significance,"Saw this movie years ago. Was taken by the muting of the voices of young women by culture. The film is rich in cultural expression and symbolism, however, that density of cultural protocol exhibits the limits...sometimes very limiting expressions of a personal sexual culture. I loved the passion/burning/fire and it all consuming characteristics. A passion I want only to enjoy vicariously. Ohh, the utility of art!"
5,An amazing body of work,"I will admit at the outset that romance style films rarely interest me.That being said, this film is over the top as far as ""reality."" Regardless of the lack of ""reality,"" it is one of the best films on the market.Within the span of viewing, we are charmed, saddened, humored, and basically brought into a fantastical world of magic, culture and food.This is a great ""date"" movie and one that will charm you with repeated viewings. Highly recommended and well worth the money."
3,Distasteful Concept of Love,"The love story, the core of this film, is just not compelling. She's weak; he's self-centered. She happens to use food to express her suppressed emotions. As with food, there are nurturing elements throughout the story: she is required to care for her mother, she nurses her sister's child, she is rehabilitated by the doctor, etc. Yet there is nothing nurturing about this love affair: it prevents her from breaking away from her controlling mother and from building meaningful relationships. In fact, she eventually uses food as a weapon against the sister whom she has betrayed. She has the opportunity to learn as much about genuine love as she knows about food and to nurture herself. Instead, she is literally consumed by lust. This had the potential to be a really good story about self love that is shared with others, like food often is."
3,Stunning Mexican movie spoiled by emotionless dubbing,"Like Water for Chocolate is a stunning movie about an early 20th century Mexican girl who supresses her love for a boy to meet cultural expectations that the youngest daughter in the family remains unmarried to care for her aging mother.

5,What a narration!,I really enjoyed this movie. It gives a very realistic portrayal of the traditions and customs of the hispanic culture. I was in awe of the flow of theme and the acting. What an awesome movie. They should make more of these soon. The movie gives a great reason to create low budget movies that are high in quality of substance.A real chicken soup for movie viewers that like a great romantic film You have to watch this movie!
5,RARE PLEASURE,"THE ULTIMATE CHICK FLICK. After reading the book, I was compelled to buy the movie. What a surprise!!!! The movie brought the book alive in the most delicious ways. I've recommended and gifted this movie over and over again throughout the years."
1,The only food this made me think of was CHEESE!!,"I can honestly write that this was one of the few movies in which I have to struggle to find something positive to write so here it goes - I might have enjoyed this movie more if I had watched it in Spanish because I thought that the translation was horrible.I found the storyline a bore, the cinematagraphy horrible, and the characters pathetic. I even tried to watch the movie a second time in case I had missed something first time around. However, that made me even more disgusted with myself for having spent money on this film. I realize that I may very well be alone in my reaction to this movie, but nonetheless my disappointment compelled me to write this review.If you are reading this and are considering this film, I would advise two alternatives: 1 - rent it if you must see it and 2 - skip this movie and watch Chocolat."
2,like water for chocolate,"I thought this movie would be just a wonderfully, romantic film concidering so many people said such wonderful things about it. I am still trying to figure out why so many people say it was so great. Maybe i just didn't understand it completely, or maybe it lost something in the translation that i didn't pick out, but overall, it was not even close to being as good as i though it would be. Yes it was a romantic movie, (which has always been my favorite kind) but i never found it to be that sweet or anything close to that. Above all, it was more of a tradigy. Maybe you will like it more than i did, so i guess if you want to, its worth a shot as watching. Remember it is in subtitles, so be prepared!"
3,The Search for Independence,"Like Water For Chocolate is the story of Tita, a Mexican woman who is struggling to escape the harsh reality of a family tradition. As the youngest daughter, she is restricted to a life without marriage, in order to care for her demanding mother. The director conveys Tita's thoughts through visual images as she searches for her independence. In order to release her overwhelming emotion, Tita cooks, knits, and learns of the spirit of shamanism. The lighting, the music, and the expressive actions of the young woman symbolize her frustration, anguish, and attempt at liberation. This family tale depicts Mexican culture as well as, the effects of tradition on the individual."
2,"This movie is ""erotic and delectable""?","The story opens on a Mexican rancho in 1910, as Tita is being born. Her harsh mother proclaims that the child will remain at home all her life and never marry, and Tita is relegated to the kitchen. When she grows up, Tita falls in love with handsome Pedro; he cannot marry her so he marries her sister just to be close to his beloved, who is now the family cook.I know this was a favorite of the critics when it came out, so I can only assume that something was lost in the translation for me, because I don't see the appeal or the greatness of this movie at all. To me, the actors seemed bland and amateurish, the scenes were choppy and poorly photographed, and story couldn't decide if it was a real love story or a magical fantasy. The meaning of the title was never explained and the last scene was just bizarre.I really expected to like this movie, but found it a low-budget, art house-wannabe. In Spanish with English subtitles."
5,"Maravillosa, Wonderfull","Maybe it's because I'm Mexican but I really love thid movie, a had the opprtunity to watch it in english and it has nothing to do with the original sound, it's awfull, so try to get it in spanish with english subtitles.And the little amount of people who doesn't like the movie well it's your problem if you don't appreciate a good movie."
3,O.K.,"Movie is set in Mexico in the early 20th century. Teenage girl (Tita) and teenage boy (Pedro) fall in love. Girl is youngest daughter of Elena who was recently widowed. Mexican family tradition requires youngest daughter to care for Mother until death. Wicked Mother cruelly marries her eldest daughter to boy. Boy agrees to marriage to stay close to girl and all parties live under same roof. Girl is wonderful cook and conveys her love, her yearning, her anguish to Pedro in the meals she prepares that have mystical qualities over everyone that digests the food. 4-way tension grows under the watchful eye of Mother until near calamity when Boy and Tita's sister are sent off to live in Texas. Male actors were mere bystanders in the plot - the relationships between Mother, Daughters and the hired hands were wonderfully developed. On the other hand, I felt that the cinematography was second rate and the mystical ""out-takes"" were over the top for me."
5,Cultural treasure,"I was attending a cultural immersion in Mexico City, MX in January 2013. The group got the chance to watch this movie. It is quite the cultural immersion of how family systems may have evolved during the time of war. Haunting, romantic and sadness all rolled up in one. Great movie!"
5,I absolutely love this movie,Both book & movie are amazing. if you're looking for an intense love story that transcends decades Como Agua Para Chocolate will take you into a decadent trip into the delisciously forbidden. It's magical.
5,Delightful.,"A story told with sympathy and humor. As a celebration of the enjoyment of food, and respect for good cooking, it ranks alongside such works as EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN and TAMPO. The copy I purchased had both English subtitles and dubbing. It was fun to compare the two. One example: the sister who became a General in the Revolution tells her sister (dubbed), ""The Revolution would be more fun if you were there to cook for me every day."" Run the same passage with the subtitles, and it comes out, ""Revolution would go better if one could eat at home every night."" A worthwhile purchase."
4,Real movie,This is the movie I saw in theaters but it does not have subtitles. You can only watch this if you understand Spanish. The movie is good.
3,"Great Movie, Disappointing Features","When buying the product I read that it had English subtitles, which it did not. Still, it is a good movie. I have the advantage of having seen it with subtitles before, so I understood what was going on. Alas, it would have been nice to be able to understand everything said."
1,Depressing Drama,"After reading a few reviews and hearing that it was similar to ""Simply Irresistable,"" I thought this would be a good romantic movie. (Whoever said it was like ""Simply Irresistable"" is crazy.) It had some romantic moments, but overall this was very depressing, and frustrating, with a mother that drove you mad.I would not recommend this movie."
2,Cosy watching but not much more,""" Like Water On Chocholate "" is an atmospheric , nostalgic and often naive film about love against all odds . It tells the story of a young girl who , because of traditions and her mother's wishes , can't live her life the way she wants to . By mixing beautiful landscapes , ghosts and genuin sweetness the movie manages to be one of the warmest mexican film imports ever , the ending of it is truly powerful but as a whole it stands somehow uneven . The fairy-tale like texture of it might put off more cynical viewers and the character of the mother is way too evil to be believable . Can deep feelings of love be translated in the kitchen ? "" Like Water On Chocholate "" fails to convince us so but it's effort is still an enjoyable one ."
4,"Tita, Would you like to come to the future, here?","Hi, Tita. Would you like to come to the future, in the 21 centry? Could you still love your coward lover, Pedro? Are you going to submit you dictatory mother? Why don't you think about your life, How beautiful you are, What a great cook, You should live your life you deserve, don't you think? You will get a wonderful life with a lover who really takes care of you, Only you. and you will be happy, enjoy your passion, and live long with your lover."
1,I guess I didn't get it?,"I was really excited to see this movie, after all the great reviews I had heard about it. I found it to be the most boring, uninvolving movie I've seen! The storyline is insulting to the intelligence of its viewers. And what is with this ""sensuous"" stuff I keep reading about? There was nothing of the sort in this film. If you're looking for a fairy-tale type movie, with dull characters and an uninteresting storyline, I guess this is it. A big letdown."
1,Just awful in every way,"OK, everyone else loved this movie but I thought it was terrible. Besides the plot -- women can only achieve happiness through the (ugh!) Mexican food they cook for their men -- the editing, film quality and high school quality cinematography made this film a nightmare to watch. Producer should be ashamed of him/herself. Next time, how about checking the expiration date on the film cartridge so at least the colors aren't faded...."
1,Not worth the effort.,"I got this movie as an add-on movie, when I purchased Babette's Feast, which was excellent and well worth watching. This movie was convoluted, strange, unprincipled and unnecessarily sexual. If you're truly in the mood for a movie that celebrates food, get Babette's Feast."
1,A poor moral and excessive nudity... no thanks,"I won't deny that this movie is well done, and I can appreciate the work that went in to making it. Personally however, I found the movie lewd and deeply lacking any worth to be found in the theme or plot. There are plenty of good movies out there to be wasting any time watching this one."
2,"Good film, worthless release","Film: 4.5 stars; DVD: 0 stars(DVD released March 2000)This is a very good - albeit not great - film whose DVD release has been ruined by Disney, as they so often do:- 18(!) minutes deleted from the theatrically released version- non-anamorphic transferIt's been over six years since the DVD was released. One can only hope that an un-butchered version is in the works. However, based on Disney's track record, and on the quality of their marketing ""wizards"", I'm not holding my breath. Don't know if Disney licenses to Criterion but, if so, that may be the only way we get a decent DVD release."
1,Sorry I bought this,This is one of the best movies ever made. It is about food. Food and cooking are the heart of this movie and the cooking has been cut on this DVD.
2,Que ha pasado?-They wrecked it!,I wanted the DVD to replace my worn VHS version-they hacked it up-POR QUE? If I could return it I would. I am on the prowl for a 'new' VHS version....
2,"Lovely idea, but fell so short of expectations","This story captivated me. I thought it sounded like something I would adore. But the characters were so one-dimensional, that there was nothing for me to relate to. I felt so disconnected from the story and nearly everyone involved. A particular scene with the mother was the only one that made any of the characters seem the least bit real and complicated (as we all really are). I would love to see it done totally differently, but I could not sit through this one again.Me fascinó esta historia. Pero no me podía relacionar con los personajes. Me sentí tan desconectada de la historia que fue difícil terminar de ver esta película. Sólo había una escena en el filme entero que hizo que un personaje (la mamá, en este caso) pereciera a un ser humano de verdad. Me encantaría ver este cuento contado totalmente diferente, pero no podría aguantar una vista de ésta de nuevo."
5,Pure Passion,"Splendid in every way! This film is an example of filmwork that spans the history of the silverscreen. Perseverance of love and internal passion is what this masterpiece is all about. The actors give their all to the utmost extent in the portrayal of the characters, making this movie shine with a plethora of great talent. Tita is a character not much different from that of Toto in ""Cinema Paradiso"", so I have an emotional connection with her as well. This film is truly a must to the foreign film collector!!"
5,"Sex and Food, what more can you ask for?","This is a yummy film in every sense of the word. I loved it and I would recommend it as a must see film along side ""The Big Blue"" and ""The Company of Wolves."" ""Like Water for Chocolate"" is beautifully crafted, well acted and an absolute must for those people who want sex, lust, desire and delicious food set out before them. I won't give away the plot, but the wedding cake scene is unforgettable, as is the serving up of enhiladas near the end of the film; both are poignant and funny in the same breath. Watch this film and drool all the way to the kitchen."
1,Como Agua Para Chocolate,"I waited weeks for this video to arrive. I was very excited about it. In the description it specifically said it had english subtitles. But when we got all ready for our long awaited movie night and turned it on, none. Sucks. I'm pissed."
2,"A Sad, Tragic Movie","In this classical Romeo and Juliet tale, Tita (Lumi Cavazos) and Pedro (Hunky-Marco Leonardi) seem destined to marry until her evil-hearted mother Elena (Regina Torne), forbids it because of some silly family tradition. Tita, the youngest, is to take care of Elena until she dies. So, she marries Pedro off to her daughter Rosaura(Yareli Arizmendi). Pedro's reasoning is that he can be near Tita but it presents a host of problems. Tragedies beset this family as well. The lovers though, overcome all of it and after Rosaura's death--finally have the chance to express their love for each other. But, how tragic--so enters FATE. This is a foreign film with English subtitles. And, this review refers to the 105 minute DVD. At first I gave it two stars, but it's perhaps a four star movie for drama and effects. But, Beware of Nudity."
4,Good Movie with clearly spoken Spanish audio,"This is a very good movie, but I bought I because the Spanish audio is spoken very clearly and in most instances slowly. However, the Spanish subtitles do not exactly match the Spanish audio, which is the case with most subtitles."
5,HOT!,"One of my all time favorites. I read the book and the movie is very close to the story line. It is so visual and full of emotions. The acting is good and keeps you intent on what happens next. Many surprises, but the best is the burning love and passion---that scene is a must see!"
3,Big Blue Block,"[...] I already owned a KitchenAid toaster, 4 years old and black, and it was large too...just not as large as this. Ok, husband likes big, so we kept it. I liked blue, so we kept it. Trouble is, big in size does not mean big in toast openings. Bagels fit in happily, but a piece of my oatnut bread has to be turned on its side and that leaves a little bit that doesn't get toasted and I don't like that. (I'm a little particular in the morning.)Fact is, I like my old one better. If, however, you are a bagel person or a person like myself that must have a blue toaster, it will grow on you."
2,Unreliable,"This toaster worked okay until, after about a few months, it began not to stay down; it would bounce right back up. When it didn't, it wiuld occassionally burn the bread while on a low setting."
1,worst music I have ever heard,"This CD is the worst music I have ever heard. It ranks below elevator music. It even is worse then porn movie music. It is trite, poorly composed and sets my teeth on edge. It is worse then that infamous CD called classical pop. I pity the fool (myself included) that buys this CD."
1,Presidency for non thinking third graders,This guy is really awful. His insights are more like a grade school teacher than a suppposed political science expert. The only people who will buy this book are those who are forced to when they take his class. That unfortunately happened to me and I wish I could get the high priced tuition back.
1,not common,you have to have a bore drill that turns clockwise to use in most american drill presses. this is a left hand drill bit and only works in drills that you can reverse direction on.
3,lines in the gutter,Hard to read because the lines of the verses go into the gutter. If you want a super giant print bible go to local bible church publishers website and go to value bibles - giant print bibles or you can call them and order 24 point John Romans and Psalms for $9 that is ring bound and awesome - this is what i give to the residents at my nursing home ministries - God BlessSalvation is by grace through faith alone. If you are preaching anything other than this stay home.
3,"Good, but not of the first rank","HEAT AND DUST is Jhabvala's most famous novel, but it's never really made it into the bigtime of novels concerning Anglo-Indian relations. Although sensitively and intelligently written, the novel's biggest problem is that the two major female characters aren't fully fleshed out: there seems to be much less to interest us regarding the narrator (who is almost a total cypher) and Olivia than there is regarding the Nawab and Chid. Still, the evocations of India both in the Seventies and the Twenties are quite marvelous. All in all, I'd say this is a well-written novel, but not quite up to the level of such other works which take on a similar theme as Paul Scott's THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN or Rumer Godden's THE PEACOCK SPRING."
4,India and Empire,"It is incredible what Ruth Prawer Jhabvala manages to do in well under 200 pages: Two women's lives, two periods in Indian history are the material for a fascinating tale about living in a foreign country. Olivia is married to a dutiful Raj official, but fascinated by a local prince. Fifty years later another woman travels to India, a descendent of Olivia's neighbours; she tries to find out what happened to Olivia, but she cannot do that as a distant observer. Just like Olivia, her life is beginning to become part of the Indian lives going on around her...There is much to learn from this book: about love, about India, what it means to live in a foreign country. It is a great book, but somehow - compared to other books by the brilliant Ruth Prawer Jhabvala - there was a little bit too much didacticism in it for my taste: It seemed to me that the narrators were always trying to explain India to the reader. Which is, in a way, a good thing, isn't it?"
3,"This book won the Booker in 1975, NOT 1983","The Amazon synopsis is in error--I couldn't figure out why a book that came out in 1975 had won in 1983, then I checked some lists, including Amazon's Awards list and found '83 was wrong. Interesting book, but not on my all time greats list."
5,touching,"This is an enjoyable novel that can be read in a few hours. Olivia, the Nawab, Harry and everyone else were believable. The picnic scene w/ musical chairs (lots of unresolved tension) was delicious. I loved it & highly recommend all of Ms. Jhabvala's other novels :)"
3,"Literary Masterpiece, but based on ''Selling East''","I do not find this book a true picture of pre/post independent India. Like many other authors, Ruth Pawar Jhabarwala has written this fiction, with an western world's perspective of India. Although, the work is a literary masterpiece, I feel the backdrop of indian culture is very unconvincing. A feeling always comes along that her idea (intended or unintended)has been to depict India in shambles, misery, mysticism and lot of color. Because that sells in the west!!"
2,Maybe I Got a Bad Apple...,"I've been a PC user for years and got fed up with the constant problems, so I made the jump to the iMac. After 4 weeks, I awoke to what some call The White Screen of Death and called Apple support. After an hour of button-pushing to no avail, the tech told me I would need to take the computer to an authorized service center. The nearest was 50 miles away. They couldn't really explain what happened, but they reformatted my hard drive, erased my data and billed me $77, even though I purchased a 3 year warranty, since ""it wasn't a hardware problem."" 3 weeks later, the hard drive has crashed again. Maybe it's bad luck or a bad Apple, but don't expect a panacea. If you live in a major metropolitan area, it might not be too much of a hassle, but make sure to back everything up. The visual design of this machine is truly beautiful. I just wish the computer would work.I'm writing this review on an HP Pavilion laptop that I've have for 7 months without problem."
2,it stopped working,"This item was WONDERFUL for the first 2 days but then stopped working. It wouldn't ""boot up"" anymore.I gave it 2 stars because this company was very easy to work with. They sent UPS to pick it up and I had a full refund within a few days. I didn't do an exchange for fear of the same thing happening again. I will go through Apple when I replace it."
2,Poor product and service,I was excited to own our first iMac only to be very disappointed. The internal power source failed after 4 months. I signed up for the ProCare service so that we could take the computer into the local Apple store for repairs. The Genius bar is a joke. The only thing the technician did was to plug the computer into a socket and tell me that it needed to be repaired and it would take 7 to 10 days (for something that could be fixed in 30 minutes for they were willing to do it). I explained that my son had typed an important assignment typed into the computer and needed it in 2 days. The store manager was not able to offer any other solutions. At least with Dell you can get next day service. Also don't sign up for .mac and the trial of Word and Apple word processing is pointless since you are not able to print in the trial version.
5,Well worth the money,"If you need a quick reference guide to look up culinary terms, or techniques, this one is great for the money. The book is some what small, about 1"" thick, and light paper is used, which makes this book VERY convenient unlike most references book that are overly burdensome.I'm currently in culinary school and as a student, I use this book all the time; it has yet to dissapoint me! Quality work here. A must for any foodie"
5,Webster's New World Dictionary of Culinary Arts (Trade Version) (2nd Edition),"Excellent service, prompt delivery, excellent conditionas described, packaged well.Would use again."
3,Webster's Culinary Arts Dictionary,"My only complaint would be that it should have been packaged better. It was only wrapped in brown paper and by the time it arrived the edges of the book were sticking out. It should have been put in a proper mailing envelope or at least reinforced the edges with tape.Customer, Virginia Mickelson"
2,Typos!!,"I bourght the book one month ago... and i've already found 2 typos!! This is unacceptable in a ""dictionary""!!"
4,"Not too bad, Not too good","I just finished reading the first five chapters of this book. And I already got a pretty good grip on What Visual C++ and Windows programming looks like. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the authur gives only minor explanation of the steps he asks the reader to do. I had to try and figure out myself why he did a certain step and what the code does exactly.If you want a quick introduction to Visual C++, its a good starting point."
5,Excellent book...,This is an excellent book for coders both beginner and intermediate alike. There is a lot of meat in this book- be careful not to take any section too lightly. The example programs are so fun there is a temptation to skim the text and follow the screen shots-- DON'T!Excellent book!
4,The Night In Lisbon- a fantastic read!,"Remarque produces yet another fantastic read. I enjoyed Schwarz as a character- he had a lot of fight in him. He could always find the irony in every situation- some parts of the novel were even humerous! I found it humerous that Schwarz sold Degas painting for mere scrap change- paintings now worth millions! Schwarz is a fine example with which to use the phrase,""Don't be careless, but don't be too careful, either."" The storyline was fascinating- I was almost disappointed when the story ended....I was ready for more! The novel was very realistic, and for this reason, my eyes remained glued to the pages. Although I wouldn't call this novel a ""tear- jerker"", as some reviews did, it definitely did have it's emotional parts. I highly recommend this novel to anyone who just plain wants to hear a great story."
3,wasn't sure what to expect,"I'm not sure what I was expecting from the author after reading ""All Quiet...."""
5,Wow,"This is a full-on page turner, and has all the elements of a hot series: cool Austin location, the perfect outsider's outsider--Yankee and Jewish Reles, Texas political subterfuge, and a perfect noir sensibility. I tore through this book. I tried hard to take nibbles of the story so that I wouldn't finish it so fast, but I just couldn't stop reading. Whoever this Simon guy is, I'm buying his next book. No, make that: whatever he writes, I'm buying it."
