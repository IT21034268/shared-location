5,Willia,"The Supremes will forever be my dreamgirls! I remember back in those years, I sung on the same stage as The Supremes. They were glamerous, and quite confident. I'm glad to finally see some of the footage from my yester years. Florence Ballard I think this DVD is in your name. Although you are'nt here anymore, you will forever be missed. Love ya Blondie!"
5,RE: THE SUPREMES DVD COLLECTION 2006.,"THIS IS AN WONDERFUL LON OVERDO DVD COLLECTION. ON THE FIRST LADIES OF MOTOWN THE SUPREMES. ALL OF THE SUPREMES NUMBER #1 HITS. FOR THE FIRST TIME ON DVD EVER FROM MOTOWN/UNIVERSAL.

THIS IS AN DYNAMITE FIRST EVER ""OFFICIAL"" USA DVD ON THE SUPREMES. FANS PICK UP THIS SUPREMES CLASSIC DVD. YOU WON'T BE SORRY! THANKS PHILLIP HOWELL NYC, NY 2006."
5,FINALLY,"I had been hoping for a dvd like this for years. Fianlly it is here. For the most part the quality is good to fair. But just seeing these perfomances takes you back to those fantastic 60's when the Supremes truly reigned Supreme. The hairdo's the purring of Diana and the great backups of Mary Flo and Cindy, truly make this dvd a must have for Supreme fans."
5,Just what I was looking for ! ! !,"Just what I was looking for, the old performances of the old groups, not the new performance of the old group...in other words D. Ross in her hey day....not her at 64yrs old playing at the Shylite Club."
5,Such Memories!,"This set of Supremes' performances shows the innocence and glamour of their early days. Watching them sing ""You Can't Hurry Love"" shows the beauty of these women and their tight harmonies. This is a must have for any Motown fan!"
5,NOTE THIS IS THE SINGLE DISC U.S. RELEASE (REGION 1),"If you are a huge fan of the Supremes note there was a very limited edition 3 disc digi-pack edition made in the UK which featured 17 additional performances not contained on the single disc issue .. Please note however that even if you are lucky enough to find the rare British edition, the discs will only play on Region 2 DVD players so viewers in the USA would require a multi-regional DVD player. Apparently the larger European edition was made for promotional purposes."
2,Buy it only if you HAVE to have it.,"Dissapointing editing and sound, I realise that they had to copy from old footage but the producers of this DVD added nothing to the mix to help it's inherent shortcomings. With today's technology I feel they could have offered something a little more professional, instead it's obvious the producers took the money and ran."
2,Compilation: Fair at best,"I absolutely love the Supremes and this is compilation was put together in order of their hits from summer 1964 to late 1969. Although some were good, most were average or below. I didn't noticed the enhanced acoustics mentioned. So for the money I suggest buy yourself 4 gallons of gas or a nice dinner out. I'll probably sell it on e-bay....."
2,Supremes New DVD,"This DVD was disappointing. After years of waiting for something of its kind, it's a big let-down because it's full of basic, average footage.The few rarities on there though are pleasing. If you're a huge Supremes fan like myself, I guess it's nice to have as a part of your collection, but in a nutshell, just go watch the clips on YouTube."
3,the cd i ordered was scratched could i get another please,i received the cd but when i opened it to play it was scratchedi would very much like another cd it cuts off when diana rosssinging someday we be together
1,"this is exactly the same as the ""Definitive Performances DVD""","Please if any of you had read a review by a A J Wilson, claiming that this was a special edition with 3 discs, and an extra 17 performances. This is not true! it is exactly the same as the cheaper American version. Why they advertise this copy as the ""Definitive DVD collection"" as opposed to the American copy of ""Definitive performances collection"" is beyond me. I ordered this copy after seeing the review by A J Wilson, only to find its exactly the same as the cheaper American copy."
4,Excelent music from The Who s' sideman guitar player!!!,"Simon Townshend is Pete ' Brother and he is a very talented musician and composer on his own. His first solo record was produced by Pete in 1985? and is still unavailable on cd and in my opinion was and still is his best recorded work. it contained songs like ""Palace in the Air"", ""Scafolding"" and ""I am the answer"" (later re-recorded for one of his solo cds and included on this one). Simon has a long recorded history but very erratic and hard to find (the first ones). This is a good way to start because includes music from his solo cds recorded more recently for his own label."
5,"If you love Queen, this is for YOU!!","Of all Queen videos, this one gets the award. It covers almost all Queen material that exsists. This video shows complete interviews and songs while other shows cut them into clips. Buy this video if there is something you've been wondering about Queen."
5,Get a hardcover copy,"I purchased this book when it first came out. (Yes I am dating myself with that remark!) The book is a classic and will always be timeless. As the publisher stated, this is a graduate level text book. I used it for self-study and solving real-world DSP problems. It worked well for me. Look for a green hardcover copy. Prentice-Hall Signal Processing Series, ISBN 0-13-605162-6"
5,Not a toy works as said,"I bought these for both of my kids which are both married with kids. Found out the kids, my Grandkids are using them more than their parents. Must be a good buy or present."
4,Great Function,It does exactly as it is advertised. Just wish the wiring was a bit more taut (when compared to my outdated slicer) and the wedge tool didn't fall out everytime we wash it.
1,Dated Information,"Don't waste your money on this 1989 video...poor visual, pc's with 5.25"" floppies, talk only...no graphics...dated information."
4,The way it was...,"This pictorial-narrative book accurately reflects the way it was and will be meaningful for those Veterans who were there, their families and anyone interested in capsulizing significant conflicts."
5,Fangs fangs and more fangs!,"This book is set in the year 2040. A high-tech criminal mastermind turned terrorist decidedes to play god by creating his own breed of super snake with DNA alteration. The snake has the traits of a cobra, a brown tree snake, and it sucks blood. This enables it to hunt any size of prey it wants. Fangs of the Serpent moves at a very fast pace, and would be good for any person who likes or dislikes to read. There is never a dull moment, and something exciting happens in almost every paragraph."
2,Interesting idea...Bad follow through!,"During High School, I was always taught to never use the words 'And then...'. This book is full of them. Found it extremely annoying!That aside, the story, is an interesting one. Typical boy meets snake, snake bites boy, boy dies type story, but with the added twist of genetically engineered snake DNA. It's mixed with spider DNA!""HOLD THE PHONE"" I hear you say. Yes that's correct. Snake and spider DNA, together at last. Like I said, the idea was interesting (please don't misunderstand me. I said interesting, not good.), but the writing style was just terrible. At times I had to re-read sections, just trying to understand it.If you're a hardcore snake fan, buy this book. If you're after a thrilling snake tale, keep looking.On a final note, the 'about the author' section was hilarious. Who ever refers to their use of computer games as 'experience' is a knob in my book."
5,Sink Your Teeth Into This One!!,I was impressed by the high-tech aspect of this creepy tale. Summers is adept at manipulating the reader into the action. Great read!! Fast paced and a fun ride!!Other novels of terror you might enjoy...The Stand: Expanded Edition: For the First Time Complete and Uncut (Signet)The Thirteen Secrets
5,"Delightful, True & Comforting","Readers (7 to 11 years old) will delight in 9 yr-old adoptee Amanda's experiences, her excitement and jealousy as she (and her 2 adopted brothers) wait for their new sister. She becomes aware of outside reactions to her family having several different ethnic backgrounds. Serious and humorous, this book deserves praise for accuracy in real life."
5,A classic for any reading collection,A families voyage into adoption proves to be filled with humor angst and love. The book offers an opportunity to explore adoption issues while telling a lovely story about a family. A treat to read whether you are adopted or not this book is a classic in the adoption field.
4,Fred Olen Ray's Best!,"Although it was once billed as a gory Roger Rabbit (yeah, sure), Evil Toons is a stultifyingly amusing romp with plenty of T&A (mostly courtesy of then-porn starlet Madison, one of the first chicks on film to have her tongue pierced) and poorly animated cartoons by Eighties goremeister Chas Balun (mostly limited to an oversexed werewolf-like character).Deliciously and compellingly trashy; probably the best celluloid crime by Fred Olen Ray, *the* mensch behind Cyclone (another half-forgotten gem) and many, many others B/Z-grade flicks.Warning: while viewing, keep tongue firmly in cheek. Period."
3,"Really dumb,but if you like Madison.....","It probabally goes without saying,but this movie is a very cheap,very bad ""horror"" movie with cheesey bits o' comedy.The only reason to watch it(or buy it) is because of former porn star Madison.She's very hot and does a sexy strip dance;you get to seeher big breasts on a couple diffrent occasions.Only die hard Madison fans would buy this video;fortunatly or unfortunatly,I'm one of them!"
4,Great book full of ideas,"I really liked this book. I'm currently planning my wedding, and this was a big help. I really wanted to do something a little different. Over the past two years I've discovered a little bit about my herritage and this seems to fit right in. Even if you don't use everthing that is said, like I am doing, it is a great place to get ideas so you do things right."
3,A basic primer,"This was a rather generalized book. It covers everything addressed in other publications. The artwork inside appears hand-drawn and gives you basic ideas about wearing the tartan, different ways to tie a tartan sash, etc. I found 2 pages helpful out of the entire book regarding the order of processional when using the services of a bagpiper. Otherwise, I found the majority of the information repetitive. If you are marrying into a Scot/Irish clan and have no knowledge of the customs this book might be helpful. I agree with other reviewers that the clan septs, names, crests, and Scottish baby names should have been reserved for another book."
3,Not so very worth the price...,"Some good ideas, but hardly worth the outrageous price. Find it in a shop, breeze through the sections that pertain to your particular wedding, and leave it in the shop. A better loaner than keeper."
2,Check your ingredients.,"I cannot recommend this product. I've learned to go to the manufacturer's website and check the ingredients because they don't list them on Amazon. Everyone's body is different, so I recommend that you only begin supplements one at a time so that you can tell how your body is reacting to it. Since I started taking this about a month ago, my joints ache. I feel very stiff and wake up during the night in pain - Very unusual for me. Also, I have less energy and sometimes have numbness in my extremities - like when your limbs ""go to sleep"". I seem to feel hungry more than usual. The next person may not experience any of these symptoms, but be careful, and again, check the ingredients. On the plus side, I have noticed that my nails and hair seem to be in better condition, but that doesn't override the negatives."
4,Very fun game,"This game is very entertaining with few drawbacks. One of the most enticing features is the price. Very cheap game, but still provides hours of entertainment. It isn't the next RollerCoaster Tycoon, mind you, but it's somewhere up there. The game does take up a lot of computer resources, and mine is jerky, but that doesn't limit the fun very much. The only other thing is that you have to first buy certain buildings to get newer ones, and when you start new levels, it gets boring having to do it over again. Along those lines, if you decide to upgrade a building and you get rid of the old one, you have to buy it again because you can't have newer buildings unless you currently have the older one.Other than these things, I find this game very entertaining with little surprises here and there. I would definetly recommend it."
1,"complete,utter waste!","This game is the worst game that I have ever played. The graphics are horrible,plus it is just plain boring. The only fun I had in this game was making a gigantic pit and then watching the skiers and snowboarders fall all the way down. tip: get another game."
3,graphics need improving,"My problem with this and other games by Activision is the graphics. I can't tailor it to make it the size I want, and the graphics also are not quite to my taste. Your mileage will vary, of course."
1,Hated it,"Primitive, Slow, as much fun as watching grass grow. I played it for 5 minutes and couldn't take it anymore."
2,Boring,This game is way too limited. It was fun for about 1 hour... fun is a bit strong of a word... it was tolerable for about an hour.
3,Dated but Decent sim game,Ski Resort Tycoon is exactly what the name implies - build a mountainside ski retreat and try to attract the most business.Performance was perfect. Any computer out today shouldn't have problems running this game. Despite the fact that it's older I had no issues under Windows XP. If you have problems try shutting off background programs like virus scanners.Pros+ Easy to use interface and straightforward explanations+ Neat feature to view resort from building cameras+ good tools and utilities to map out resortCons- dated graphics and terrible sound (to be expected)- very limited selection of buildings and upgrades- tutorial is short and doesn't cover very muchOverall... decent sim game but very limited in scope and appeal. The clunky graphics and sound take away from the game (in my opinion). When compared to Rollercoaster Tycoon and Zoo Tycoon the weakness of Ski Resort is obvious.
2,Not a Must Buy!,"This game is really disappointing. I love Tycoon and Sim games, but this one is bad It has a good concept like Airport Tycoon but doesn't carry it out as well as other tycoon games The graphics are horrible It is very unrealistic You do get hooked but it does get boring after about an hour. The game is easily hacked. Big Foot is cool Not a bad price, but this is more like a 9.95 then 19.95 game. It is a Tycoon game though, so if you are a fan you might as well give it a try.Fast Food Tycoon is a better game by the same company & it is the same price!"
1,A 19.99 WASTE,"This game is for people of simple minds, who like simple things, and think very simple. The game was very bad, who ever made this game needs to try again. Things wrong... *Cant turn veiw on screen(no left to right changing) *Very slow, and sometimes to fast *No real goal, just build it and they will come *Horrible sound *Not enought choices And Many Many more...... I would invest my money in something that makes sense. Good qualities... *watching skiers fall!"
2,Fell Short of Fun,"This game had a good idea but it was a wannabe of RCTycoon. The first couple days I had it, it was fun but after a while it got boring. You don't really get a lot of freedom to do what you want, like in RCTycoon. In this game basically all you do is build lifts and buildings and watch skiers fall. Personally I wouldnt reccomend it."
2,Better Sims Out There,"I bought this game with the expectation of it being like Roller Coaster Tycoon. I was wrong.In Roller Coaster Tycoon there are many campaigns at different parks you can do. You get new rides and stuff through R&D.; I expected the same in this game. Instead, I found it had 5 campaigns (all which were pretty easy...), not much building variety, and not that fun.This is just my opinion. Instead of getting this game, I suggest ""The Sims"" or ""Roller Coaster Tycoon"" to you."
5,The real King of the Dancehall,"Art of War, without doubt is a great compilation of hard hitting, lyrical shots aimed at the rivals of the Killa. The album targets those fans of the Killer who appreciate this side of the deejay the best. Blood Bath, Warlord no business, Stainless, are all classic confrontational hits which has made the Killer the Warlord. Overall, if you are a fan of some of the Killer's earlier ""warring"" tunes, and wish to appreciate the most talented lyrical murderer of the contemporary dancehall era, then Art of War is for u."
4,Attention Grabbing Title with Great Content!,"Middle to High Schoolers as well as adults will pick this book up out of curiosity and immediately become engrossed. The question and answer format encourages browsing, and the book includes lots of nice features such as an index, a section for related reading, a section of web addresses and mail addresses for space related organizations. Students will find useful report information presented here in a fun format. The book also includes a number of photographs and drawings relating to the questions it helps answer. Students will discover the many effects of living in space from one of the men who has spent the most time there!"
4,Easy-to-understand answers to space questions,Great book for a middle school or high school library. Answers lots of frequently-asked questions about astronaut's life in space.
3,Faces in the Crowd,"I took a chance on this film, had not heard of it while in the theater. I am so glad that I did. this was a most interesting film and informative as well. I was introduced to a psychological problem that I had never heard of before. I found it deeply interesting"
4,Good movie but ended sad,Movie was well put together and worth the price. I liked it.... had me sitting on the edge of my seat during several parts. Overall I give the movie a good rating.
3,Enjoyed only because of Actors,"Actors, cinamatography, etc. all good; butalmost non-existent story/content. I have not/will notrecommended to anyone and will not watch again."
4,Faces in the Crowd,McMahan and Jovovich usually don't disappoint. This looks like a very good Thriller that will leave you at the edge of your seat. I plan to own it.
2,Huh.......?,"There are so many inconsistencies in this movie, I don't know where to start. Wait till this movie is on your local cable network."
5,very cool,"Nicely Done was on the edge of my seat, although I did figure it out about 1/2 way through, it kept me doughting"
2,stupid don't waste your money,one version has her singing the other version is the same just biggie's part from one more chance not even worth the money.
5,Cat Stevens Majikat special edition,Yusuf or Cat Stevens he is the greatest ever. I've been listening to him for 35 years and am very excited he's back.
5,Any Cat Stevens fan will love this,"The DVD of the concert is beautiful. Watching Cat perform his songs as he embodies the feelings he elicited in me many years ago is such a gift. My husband and I have listened to the CD hundreds of times and will never grow tired of it. The tone of the concert is joyous, and of course sensuous."
4,"Owned it, returned it, nice watch though","I purchased this watch soon after it came out. Prior to owning this I had a Tag Heuer S/EL. While it is a lovely watch I had become spoiled by the smooth link bracelet of the S/EL and found this one a little uncomfortable by comparison. I also felt like switching from an S/EL to the replacement for the 2000 series was a bit of a step backwards.So I returned the Aquaracer and purchased a Link Diamond. The bracelet was a lot more comfortable and it looks a little nicer for my taste.If you are used to a conventional metal bracelet and a fairly large watch, you will probably love this watch. It just wasn't quite what I wanted."
1,Horrible piece - everything about it is a lie,"The stone is CLEAR, not washed out, but completely lacking in anything vaguely resembling a color. Essentially, this is LYING in advertising. I would have liked to know that there was a good chance I would get an earrings that could not vaguely be described as green amethyst, or green or anything in the family of a stone with a color. If I wanted clear quartz earrings, I would have ordered them. Instead I ended up with them despite consciously ordering something else. Shame on you, Amazon."
1,waste of money,"cant decipher if its a blurry piece of glass or what. the setting is not good as well. the prongs are way above the stone. overall, this is a cheap quality piece."
4,Pretty earrings,"These are pretty earrings, I purchased for a friend and actually was quite surprised at how nice they look. The color is suppose to be a very pale green from what I've seen and that is what they look like. A nice size, not to big, not too small."
5,Better than I expected,"These earrings are a beautiful pale green and well cut. When the light reflects off the facets you can see a deeper shade of green. The length is about 5/8 inch, a perfect size for stud earrings; I wouldn't want them any bigger. The setting is also very nice but you must be careful when inserting them as the prong is very thin and could easily be bent or broken off. Overall, I'm very satisfied with this purchase."
1,Shame on you Mr. Coverdale!,Another greatest hits album?! We already have all these songs. Isn't there any unreleased or live stuff you can issue for the die hards! How about a live album with John Sykes! The only reason I would buy this if the sound was remastered and it was less than $14.00. $18.99 ouch - it should come with Tawny Kitean for that price!! Maybe someone could tell me that's heard it how it sounds. At least I'll feel better if I knew it was remastered.rockroll1970@yahoo.com
4,good resource,These DVD's are a nice resource on the M1 Garand and basic rifle marksmanship. THey are original US Army training films so you're kind of getting some real WW@ history as well.
1,Not good at all,"I got one of these for christmas. It was rather large compared to some of the others in it's price range and the timing of the songs is so inacreate. You have to use 96kbs quility songs for it 2 be acreate, lower quility songs it just takes a guess at the lenght according to the quility. Also it takes an age to copy and delete songs. After about 2 months of having one it broke and the buttons would not work. I got a RCA K@zoo! copys and deletes about 20times quicker and is smaller, more durable and has acreate timing."
1,I had no instructions; could not make heads or tails of the device so I sent it back.,"I should have known better than to order this type of device as it had no instructions and I know nothing about MP3 devices. I ordered it simply by brand name, but I could not get it to work and I sent it back."
1,Doesn't work with Windows XP,"Hi, Just purchased the Samsung NEU 32. It doesn't work with my new indows XP based computer. I phoned Samsung and they said they rely on Jukebox software...and they expected a XP fix towards the end of January. I hope it works...."
3,Very interesting,"I learned a great deal from this book. I just think it is humorous that he had to be so wordy and long winded to explain how succinct and concise the Apache are. If he meant this for lay persons he missed the mark just a bit, I have never had to look up so many words to get through one sentence!! Keep your dictionary handy!"
3,Wisdom Sits in Places,"This book was mediocre at best. Although Keith Basso did provide some insight into why the Apache people cherish their land, I felt that Basso kept on saying the exact same thing in every sentence. I had the point of the entire book by the time I was ten pages into it, and it kept on going, therefore making me lose my concentration on what I was reading."
3,Does creative means to read the author 's mind?,"I didn't like this book because I was looking for another kind of puzzles, not the same old ones. ""Out of the box"" means to me to think in a new way,or to see it differently, but this books asks me to guess or to read author's mind."
2,Poor quality,"I guess the 3 other reviews (sent before my review) are fake reviews.The questions are boring. Usually it asks you arrange some things, or trick you with words ,or not provide enough information (assumptions that the book will use in their answers)Each question can have multiple ways to answer.The answer for each question is usually not good.The book really asked you to ""think outside the box"".However, to think creative , we need to think outside the box but what we think still have to be RATIONAL in some ways. You can not just make a crap idea and u say it is creative. I find the explanations here just not acceptable to me.Don't buy it."
3,good deal but not good quality,yea it might be bunch of stuff in one pack.it is not so good quality.but can be useful when new baby comes .as it can add up when you buy so many things individually.overall a useful product.
4,Imagination Wins,"This is the best book of new poems I've read in twelve years. McNally's poems are not only heartfelt and create a unique world, they are victories of the imagination. The fanciful, bordering on surreal, world he describes is not one so much of childhood, and certainly not of childishness, but of the persistence of a person determined to keep his heart open in a world that would prefer it remained shut. He will not close his eyes to personal pains of unrequited love or to the impersonal pains of the history of imperialism that have created our culture. His task as a poet is daunting. That he succeeds in these poems of sensitive strength is a marvel. Imagination 1: Reality: 0."
2,Painfull to read.,"I am a Dragonlance fan, and I've read most of the books. Although English was not my favorite subject, I always scored high on English Comprehension Exams. What does that have to do with Mr. Knaak's novel? Everything. I found myself in agony reading just the first two chapters. Too many sentances seemed to have been thrown together on a whim. It baffles me how this got past the editors prior to being published."
5,Keeps you up late at night!,"This book sits in my bookcase as one of my all-time favorites. I've now read it three times, and find it fascinating and mesmerizing each time. And some parts of it really freak me out.I'm not a UFO-guru, but this book asks the one burning question: ""If we are NOT being visited, then what exactly IS going on? Why are people in remote locations of the world, with no desire to achieve fame, reporting the same bizarre experiences?"". This book tries to address that.Educational, yet entertaining. And it does so in an intelligent, well-presented manner which doesn't come across as pushy or hokey.Highly recommended! Good luck trying to sleep after reading this one."
3,Interesting...,"That's about all I can say about this book... it's interesting. But it leaves me no more convinced about the varacity, and if anything now I'm somewhat concerned that vulnerable, hurting people may be being misled into believing that past traumas have some sort of paranormal or occult explanation. The last chapter dealing with various theories on the phenomena is the only really worthwhile part of the book."
3,Ok but not great.,"I should have realized from the picture, this item is way too large for my small arm, and for that reason isn't all that comfortable. I have to cinch it down pretty tight to handle the weight of the Classic iPod, and it chafes my skin. I like that the ear buds can be velcro-ed onto the unit."
4,Tune belt for Palm Pre,"This product works well as far a being able to hold the Pre. It's not the easiest to get in and out of the sleeve, but it works and holds it securely."
1,"Good concept, bad material","THIS ARMBAND BROKE IN 4 DAYS!! The armband is a really good design with a great neopreme pocket flap to help keep your Ipod dry but the huge problem with the carrier is the feaux leather/vinyl. From the moment I bought the carrier, I knew this would be a problem. The vinyl is extremely brittle and easily torn. I thought that if I was careful with the carrier it would last (It was cheap enough for a few months of good use, which was fine for me)...I thought wrong. The design issue is that they used this terrible vinyl in the loop that holds the armband to itself. That is the point that gets the most stress during use!The first time I tried to adjust it during a jog, it was history. I was not putting undo pressure, stress, or abusing it in anyway. Do not buy this carrier. Spend more and get something that will work."
1,terrible,"The stitching came loose and completely ripped the first time I tried to use this armband. I'm not Hulk Hogan or anything, the product just stinks."
1,Waist of time and money,"This product has such a bad quality that I just could not even look at it. Based on the price (USD 18 almost - not too cheap), I would expect a minimum quality level ..... however, I realized it was made in Taiwan and based on the quality it should not cost more tha 1 USD to be made.Waste of time and money. Forget it!.... Try another product."
3,What you get for the money.,"This product does the job, and at the low price I can't complain too much. BUT....I wish I'd of spent more money on a better product. Especially considering I'm putting a $300 piece of equipment in it. If you have small arms, it is tough to stay up. It is not easy to adjust either. I like the feature of the Velcro slot for your ear buds to be wrapped up, but the holes for the plugs on top and bottom don't line up. This product works, per say, but don't have high expectations."
3,"Fits well on arm & cord holder is a positive, but hard to turn wheel","I've worked (out) my way through many iPod holders, and this one is pretty good, but has one significant, annoying negative.Positives:- so far, decent construction (no tears, etc.)- fits snugly on my arm- the side cord holder is greatNegative:- on the current iPod classics, the wheel is harder to turn, so having the thick(ish) plastic there causes a problem: you can't turn the wheel, and have to remove the iPod if you want to do anything other move back or forward (and, if your headphones don't have a separate volume control, that would be a problem). Removing it actually is annoying because it's snugly encased (which is also a good thing)"
5,loved!!!,"Using this product has made my workouts easier. In the sense, I don't have to carry my IPOD around in my hand or clip it to my shirt ( which was very annoying). Love it!!!"
5,great armband!,"I have large biceps, so I was concerned that this might not fit, but that isn't a problem at all. It fits with room to spare, stays in place, and protects the ipod well. It is a bit hard to adjust volume through the plastic, but it's not impossible, and you can always cut a circle out if it drives you nuts. Overall I find this well worth the money."
1,Not good,Poor quality band that never really felt secure due to the D-ring type fastener. Although I was using a Blackberry instead of an iPod for this. But the band was terrible.
4,Great for normal arms,"Delivered perfectly even though I do not live within the U.S. (Venezuela). The armband is great for those who have medium size arms. It doesn't feel loose, you just have to tight it up and it stays there. If you workout something like biceps or triceps, you'll have to loose it up a little, but other than that is great (especially for jogging). The ""cord holder"" is designed perfectly so the cable does not interfere with your workout/exercise/etc. It fits great for my iPod 5th generation 80 GB; it could also hold my BB Pearl Flip but the headphones/headphone jack be in possible danger when jogging (it has 2 holes for the ""hold"" button and ""headphone jack""."
4,Does what it needs to do,"The armband is a bit dodgy and hard to adjust but otherwise this works really well. My iPod is an old one-60GB video-but it still fits. The first time I tried to put my iPod in the case, I couldn't get it in and was convinced it wasn't as universal as claimed. However, it does loosen up consideraly with use. Holds your pod very snugly. It won't fall out as it occasionally did with my old armband."
2,"the quality is just ""Okey""","I have to say I'm a little bit disappointed by the quality of the armband. It's not cheap, I mean compare to these super bargain $0.11 armband. But it looks like cheap and smells terrible..."
3,"Its not the best, but works","Its not the most comfortable for your upper arm, so i wear it on my forearm. The strap isn't easy to adjust."
1,Not what I ordered,"I ordered this and it said it was for the iPod Classic, I received one for the iPod nano, I didn't realize it because it was a gift for my girlfriend, which I gave her several months later. When she told me it wasn't for the iPod classic I contacted the seller and they basically said it's been too long, so tough cookies. Buy this at your own risk, it may not be what you ordered, and if you get anything out of my review, it's this: DO NOT BUY THIS FROM TUNE-BELT INC."
1,Frustrated that it wasn't clear to me what size device it was for,"In the product advertisement, it wasn't clear to me that it just fits the iPOD nano (rather than the traditional iPOD). It's the wrong size."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!,"Spend the extra money and get a more expensive arm band. The material is cheap, esp. the plastic cover. It is difficult to fit the i-pod in the armband period; forget about it if you have it in a case. Despite putting it on so tight it hurt my arm, the armband STILL managed to wind it's way down my arm. Do not buy this product unless you want a cheap temporary solution."
5,Best ipod armband!!!,This armband is very easy to use and was very affordable! I feel like I got the most for my money!!
4,Nice armband,Needed an armband for my Ipod Video so I can listen while I ride my mountain bike. This works nice. Only thing that would improve it is some velcro. Kinda hard to tighten it when it is around your arm. Some velcro there would be a great improvement. It holds nice and I can use the Ipod while it is still in this case. Just need to take it out to charge.
3,"Adequately fulfills purpose, but not much else","This is an okay band, but being my first, I'm not sure how it compares to other bands. It is a little uncomfortable at times and makes using my iPod complicated. The protective screen is nice but it makes it difficult to change songs, volume, etc. I'm not completely dissatisfied with this band, but there are some things I wouldn't mind changing either."
4,Inspirational,"The writing is not the best-But the stories are touching and profound.The messages are inspirational. It has inspired me to volunteer in my community with a Share the Health Fresh Food drive for a women's shelter. I am starting this weekly delivery service with the contributions of my local Curves gals. We all can make a difference- and after you read this book, you will probably be inspired to do something- be creative! Let me know what you do! ayyeh30@aol.com"
5,Great Game,Great Version of the game for MAC.Loved it!It is worth to play all the kinds of different ways to play it!Enjoy!
4,EXCITING! but...,"I think in my personal opinion AOM is a fun, interactive game. with nine major gods to chose from I was imadetly was adictid to the game being 10 years old I loved the the game adrealin compared to the games that I play on gamecube. The one thing I don't like aboute this game is the the begining. often times whan my vilages are colecting resoces I often find my self bord and soon I turn off the game. overal Age Of Mytholagy is a fun. action-paced game. BUY IT NOW!!!!"
5,Worked great,"I missed my games when I switched over to Mac, this has helped a lot. I was a huge fan of the original Age of Empires, and I owned all of them for PC. This was one of my favorites by far so i got this one for my Mac system. It's just as you remember playing it on PC and will bring you hours of entertainment. ENJOY!"
3,Too PC or not PC enough....,"I have a Mac and my wife has a PC. We like to play games together. AOM is one of her favorite PC games, so I bought the Mac version so we could play together. Found several problems with this. The first one is that Mac and PC versions can't be played on the same server. This may be an inherent problem with the programming or it could be because the PC version is several updates ahead of the Mac version. Second, there's been little effort to ""Mac"" the PC game. For example, the manual and pop-up help instruct you to ""right click"" in order to do a lot of things, which are actually done by ""control"" clicking. I've played the PC version of the game as well; even though I'm playing on a high spec machine with my Mac, the game has a sluggish, unresponsive feel on my computer. AOM is a great game, but it feels like MacSoft didn't spend as much time on this one as they should have."
5,could have been a sailor,"by far the best song on this is I could have been a Sailor' written by Peter Allen.. ( liza minneli's first gay husband, and the Boy from Oz is about played by hot Hugh Jackman. Great melody.. Probally her best song.."
2,Exquisite voice but the arrangements are a little flat,"Sometimes one doesn't like a particular song or CD not because its not good music or a good performance but, rather, because it's not their cup of tea. Maureen McGovern has one of the most melodic voices among those in her category i.e. Barbra Streisand, Linda Eder. Most of her work really hits the mark. But this one drags for me. It's lounge music (which I like) that ends up in the background rather than on centerstage. Piano solos are fine but need some luster if there are no other instruments. This is one of those CD's I'll end up giving away, hopefully to someone who can appreciate the tempo and concept here."
3,"Good, but not as good as I was hoping","During a recent trip to Cape Breton my wife and I both were intrigued by recordings of the Rankins we heard in restaurants, stores, etc. The live music we heard (Sheumas, Kyle, and several other MacNeils; etc.) there pushed us over the edge and we had to have some of that music to listen to at home. The CD's we saw for sale in Canada seemed significantly over-priced, even spending Canadian Dollars. Amazon solved that problem and based on what we'd heard and the user reviews I bought Collection. We enjoy listening to it; I think my wife might like it a little more than I do. It's good, but not *that* good. We'll probably try one more Rankin Family album, hoping for something that moves me a little more."
4,Our Son Loves This,We have a mildly autistic boy and he loves these videos. The thing he likes the best is that he can make his own workout routine from the DVD as well. This helps him to relax some and relieves a little tension.
4,Excellent Laser Printer Combo,Solid performance long term with the Brother MFC line as we have used one for years. This one offers wireless printing as well as wired network printing. Easy setup for either networking. Multitasking is a strong point with this product as you can scan while it is printing set a fax to go while receiving another. As with all Laser printers warming up is a little slow but very quick when it gets going.
2,mfc-8870 DW Toner issues,"We got this machine it performed flawlessly. both pc & macs are printing via usb & wireless, quality is tops. After, the 2nd cartridge, we have NOT been able to install a new cartridge properly. We have bought 3 different cartridges none fit in properly. We got a new machine and still the same problem. when we manage to get the cartridge in properly the paper jams all the time. Darn, it was too beautiful to last.... we are using brother stock all the way and it still doesn't work. The techs at Fry's don't seem to be able to correct this either. so it is in the repair shop for 5 weeks and we have a brand new one that has the same symptoms...Man it was too good to be true. If we don't resolve this we are going to HP. We've had several Brother machine and they did work well."
2,WON'T WORK WITH VONAGE!,"THIS MACHINE WON'T WORK WITH VONAGE. BROTHER TOLD ME THIS, AND VONAGE TRIED TO WORK WITH ME, BUT IT IS HIT OR MISS WHEN YOU FAX SOMETHING TO SOMEONE. USUALLY YOU WILL GET THE ""COMMUNICATION ERROR: 8001"" WHEN YOU FAX. I SEEM TO BE RECEIVING FAXES FINE. BUT I BOUGHT IT STRICTLY FOR THE FAX AND COPIER. I HAVE TO SEND THINGS MULTIPLE TIMES FOR THE RECEIVER TO GET IT!"
3,Great copier; lousy for envelopes and scanning,"Amazingly this is a great copier/b-w printer for copying and printing. However, almost every envelope comes out wrinkled, even when we adjust the levers in the back as suggested in other reviews. We send out wrinkled envelopes to customers - yuk. Also I am not an expert in scanning but the quality seems truly lousy, so I only scan when necessary. Seems like a slow scanner too.So if you don't need envelopes or scanning much, a good option. I would not buy again and regret my purchase."
2,no title,"I agree totally with the reviewer that said it looked like a music video, and that music video style is frustrating and annoying to watch. I have purchased videos of Ballet and Modern Dance performances, and the filmakers always held respect for the art form and showed the dancers full form. I am sickened at the fact that because this happens to be bellydance, they felt obligated to turn it into a vulgar display of body parts. Bellydance should get the same respect as other dance forms."
3,Ok,"I have both this DVD and bellydance superstars at Folie Berger. The one from Folie Berger is great, but this one is not so great. The Folie Berger DVD appears to be more professionally produced. This one seems to be more of an amature production. I Liked it though, because I was just looking for bellydance performances. I didn't care too much for the costumes used here. It seems like they are compeeting for the price of the most special costume. Some of them were rather bizarre-looking so in some way they succeeded in being speicial."
3,Over edited!,"I would give this video a rating of ""I-love-these-dancers-but-the-video-could-have-been-better"". I was really looking foward to this video, but I was disappointed - mostly due to the camera tricks and editing.I would like to suggest that anyone who likes Bellydance Superstars should get Bellydance Divas. They present a variety of dances and the camera work is a little more sane. I enjoyed it."
4,yay.,"the performances are really good, but it would be nice if they had tutorials and some interviews with the dancers."
3,Smack that cameraman,"As others said, the dancing in general is good (and amazing in some cases) but the cropping of the camera ruins some of the performances--in Rachel Brice's segments, you can tell she's doing some amazing movements below her ribs, but they're only showing her chest up and focusing on the face! Why?? Most of the time you need to see at least the hips up of a dancer to appreciate what's going on.I could have done without the Marilyn Monroe bit entirely--I like camp in belly dance, but there was no variation, and seemingly no point.However, the set, costumes, music and interplay of the musicians and dancers were all quite good. I'm hoping a different DVD of BDSS will show their skills off better."
2,Shot like a cheap Porn movie...,"This video is dreadful! Excellent dancers were reduced to mere body parts. Most of the performances were filmed primarily of close-up shots of the body parts (through a cheesy, porno-type smoke. It was impossible to see the choreography of these very fine bellydancers. If you care at all about form and function of the dance, you will be disappointed by the filming of this DVD."
4,The Greatest Bellydancers In The World,"This debut DVD of the world-famous bellydance troupe features your favorite dancers, including Suhaila Salimpour, Rachel Brice, Amar Gamal and Dondi Dahlin. I especially loved Dondi's bellydance tribute to the late Marylin Monroe. Their bios and special features were also included in the DVD. I will be looking forward to future Bellydance Superstars DVD releases."
4,Great book to make you question established teachings.,"An inspired book. After just reading the spell-binding ""The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years"" by R. Patton, I have to say this book - even though it makes extraordinary claims - may just turn out to be truer that the New Testament! Some of the passages are a little difficult to read because of the period writing, yet many diamonds of information shine out with the ring of truth. After reading this book I may have to view many of the Church's official doctrines with a skeptical eye"
4,Ever wonder what Jesus was up to from ages 12-30?,"Well, this book claims to have the answer. Interesting account, though most likely false, as the back cover even admits. The whole astrological age part is interesting and I must wonder is that change going to be the great event that is supposed to occur in 2012? Will we get a new savior then as the gospel teaches? Who knows but I'm waiting. Peace, brothers and sisters."
1,Be careful,"Matthew 24:4 ""Jesus answered them, ""Be careful not to let anyone decieve you. Many will come using my name. They will say, ""I am the Messiah',and they will decieve many people."" Not much else needs to be said about this book. The whole idea of it is that we can become christs when we follow Jesus I think. It is very dangerous...I read a few chapters and my whole world basically collapsed. Please be careful everyone."
1,Deception and Fantasy,"This book is written by Levi Dowling, a nineteenth-century Disciples of Christ minister. It is wildly popular in the prisons, where cults flourish and multiply like bedbugs. It is a first-class book of rank heresy and deception. It is the nature of people to be attracted by the off-beat, and new 'revelations' and occultic dreck, shying away from the traditional God-breathed Scripture. Many people have been deceived by this garbage, and continue to be so. Save your money and get something solid rather than visions and pure conjecture."
5,Touching my soul with the beauty of its presentation,"If you find the life of Jesus confusing or in too archaic language in the other new testatments, you will be moved from within by this spiritually moving retelling. The account also includes the missing years that Jesus spent in India recaptured from the akashic records by the author who prepared for 40 years to be able to bring out this information. It totally resonated with my heart."
5,Must Read,"I was hesitant at first to read this Gospel, but once I got into it, it clarified so many questions for me. I find it's stories and parables more complete and explained more in depth than I could find in the Bible. I would not recommend this book with out knowing the Bible first, this Aquarian Gospel really made me look at Jesus' teaching more clearly. I very much enjoyed this book and it has helped me in my search for the Way of Christ."
5,Good for the soul,"I loved this book in paperback. I love it more having it in my Kindle Fire. When I need insipration, it' s at my hand."
1,Parental Advisory Explicit Content,I ordered this video that did not have a rating or any reviews.When I received the video and reviewed it was nothing like I expected.First of all it is very amateuristic. Second it is not appropriate for minors.I feel the summary on the back of the video should have been listed in the description. If the summary had been listed I would have NEVER ordered the video.
1,What a waste,"If you want to see the usual mardi gras women DO NOT get this. It has maybe 15 women in it repeated over and over, plus this guy comes on and talks about nothing every 5 minutes. Most of the footage is of the parade floats and people just walking around, oh and a brutal segment of a guy drumming on buckets that caused me to throw it away. Way to throw away your money."
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"This movie just moves too slowly. I got about half way through & turned it off.Good idea, but I just couldn't sit through it."
4,A Writer's Guide to Powerfull Paragraphs,"A book that looks like a construction kit.Repetition makes it effective, but sometimes annoying.I will keep it on my desk for awhile.I just bought the book on transitions."
5,Honest_Reviewer,"This is a good book and I used it only once or twice. I don't even remember reading it. Why am I saying this? Because in this day and age there is a thing called Internet and you can find everything that you need without cluttering your house with books. Some may disagree on this and even I have a library at my house but I noticed I use the internet most often. Of course, I am not getting rid of my books either. So...everyone is different. You can get this book if you are gonna use it and don't mind the extra junk piling up."
5,So many memories,"What a lot of great shows with simple but memorable story lines. Nice to watch shows with no sex, bad language etc and still be entertained..."
5,"It was a gift for family, they loved it!","It was a gift for family, they loved it! I didn't actually watch it myself."
4,Merry Sitcom Christmas Classics from TV Golden Age,"I miss so much the old shows and the way things were once in America. Watching these old episodes brought back a great deal of memories from when America was more family, more friendly and had more morals. May we find that place again."
3,Old-Time Christmas Sitcoms,"I was a bit disappointed, since most of the sitcoms were pretty lame about Christmas, though they did give a warm, fuzzy feeling inside."
4,Merry Sitcom,"Good to reminisce about the ""older"" shows that I remembered while growing up. Most might consider them a little ""corny"", but they still are good."
3,"SOME WERE FUN TO SEE AGAIN, SOME DIDN'T STAND THE TEST OF TIME","I admit I am a big softy about old movies and reruns from when a I was a child. Apparently, I am too old to enjoy drunk housewives screaming at each other.As a little girl, my friends and I loved seeing how we thought young women lived. I loved That Girl and Bewitched, but some of the others were before my time and seemed a little strange. Father Knows Best was the strangest of them all. ""Little Kathy"" with her secondary teeth, looking like a third grader, carries around a worn stuffed animal and dreams of Santa comming. I realize it was meant to be heartwarming, but it just looked laughable. In the household where I grew up, if you still believed in the jolly old guy past first grade, you were just a dumb kid.I am all for watching many of the old black and white TV shows, but this DVD reminded me, not all of the series had the great writing found on the early Andy Griffiths Show."
4,Works as advertised,"Yes the manual needs to be more clearly written, but otherwise it performed as expected.Pros: Was quieter than other machines, able to spray paint that wasn't thinned at all, very little dripping out of nozzle (considering I had done my whole garage with it), easy to disassemble and clean.Cons: Poor manual (read carefully before using), adapter for paint can fits so-so, yet tight it enough that it didn't fall off.Remember, as with all machines of this type, you can't just stop for lunch and let it sit; it will just clog up and be a nightmare to clean. When you are all done, no matter how wiped out you are, clean it completely and you won't be out of luck the next time you need it.Overall, very pleased compared to friends' stories of Wagner power painter disasters."
5,Mommy's gift to her big boy!!!,"My son's birthday was this past weekend and the best gift he received was from me. When he wakes up, he points to his Pooh bear an starts squeezing its tummy so it can say something. My son is just one year old and he has been all about Pooh since his birth. I hope he will continue to enjoy it for the years to come. I'm considering getting him the entire gang. So far I found Tigger and Eeyore but no Piglet. I guess the search will continue on. I would recommend this bear to any parent whose child loves Pooh. The expressions you get every time they play with it are priceless."
5,Good basic comb,I use it to detangle my hair after showering and it gets the job done quickly and painlessly.
3,its alright,I actualy noticed more ripping of my hair with detangeling combs than i have with using a brush. But for people to like the combs better this is a pretty nice cheap one.
2,Doesn't detangle,I was disappointed. I have medium long thick hair and the comb is pretty much useless when my hair is wet.
4,Good Comb,"Bought this comb as a replacement for a hard plastic detangling comb that I lost.This comb gets the job done--the teeth flex and bend a little bit, which didn't happen on the previous comb I had.But overall it works on my thick shoulder length hair which is hard to comb when it's wet.As a bonus, the ""random color"" I received was purple--my favorite!"
4,Does the job,"This comb does work, although it just does a basic job and I don't understand the claim that it creates ""volume"" in the hair. I see these claims advertised on combs and it seems like a gimmick to me. The plastic is somewhat cheap feeling and after a long time of use it did break a little but was still usable. I ended up losing mine though and bought a different brand. Also the design is not very visually appealing."
1,"Cheap, terrible comb","Do not buy this comb! It is brittle, cheap plastic that broke the first time I dropped it. It also hurts when going through my hair."
2,Three Months and It Broke!,"Snapped right in half, using it on my 3 year old daughter's hair. I did put it through it's vigors, but still, come on."
1,Broke within a week :(,"I wasn't expected this inexpensive comb to last forever at the price when I added it to my cart to meet my $25 shipping minimum, but when combing my wet curly hair it snapped in half within a week after buying. Disappointing as the teeth are nice and far apart and comb is not made of cheap plastic. Liked the looks, but unfortunately I wasn't going for looks only when wanting tangle-free hair..."
5,brightblack morning light my new late night delight.,"this album has cool all over it. it's like the coolest film score to the coolest film never made. minimalist, mysterious, and sometimes a bit eerie, this recording goes right onto my classic list of late night listening pleasures. i can see myself listening to this 10 years from now and beyond. slow and beautiful sounds creeping across decades of nights. the british publication ""mojo"" picked this as the 26th best album of 2006. i put it somewhere in my top 5."
4,"boring, sure, but ELECTRIFYINGLY boring","Southern rock-dub would be the most suiting genre, I think. I find it genuinely daring of them to ooze such a slow groove for so long. A little gimmicky...maybe that, too. You won't want to listen to this all the time, but definitely on the mark when golden light rakes through the room."
3,repetitive,"The cd is ok. I find it to be very repetitive in the sense that all of their songs sound the same, but somehow I still can not stop listening to it."
3,"Laid-back, cool, groovy . . . but . . .","Brightback Morning Light - (self-titled, 2006). . . the entire album comes close to sounding like one continuous mellow song. A somewhat modern and spacey update of old-school funk-soul-blues, the album is very laid-back, sometimes to the point of lethargy and the organ riffs are endlessly repetitive. R.A. Hughes' voice is appropriately serene and breath-y and there's a fair amount of variety in the choice of instruments despite the overly dominant Rhodes organ. The monotonous style isn't necessarily a bad thing if you just need something in the background to groove on or even fall asleep to. It's a decent chill-out record."
4,do you like bohren & der club of gore?,not very jazzy - but does the same sort of tripped down focus to folk and blues that bohren does with jazz. i love it. don't be turned off by the other reviews if you like the bohren
2,you get what you pay for,One of the pearls fell out of the setting the second I took it out of the packaging. It was glued in. It is a pretty ring...but I guess you get what you pay for
5,a great read,"Untangling... is a great read--incredibly succint and informative first section putting Balkan geographics, politics, historical,religious, and ethnonational concepts into perpective for an average american guy like me, larger main portion a real fascinating page turner by a great American writer with a hell of a lot of guts for a solo, freelance journalist traveling all around Bosnia and Hercegovina during these tumultuous times! chilling. talk about timely expose' ! this guy was still over there just as the bombs were about to fly in the Serbian/kosovo conflagration. highly recommended."
4,Not A Bad Little Collection...,"These are rather nice little stories about the upper crust and their troubles. Some stories are more like character sketches. The people are either middle aged, or are the children of same, and they are all rich, but the reader's nose is never rubbed in this fact. They are the ""old, discreet rich"" rather than the brash, gaudy ""new rich"". These stories are well written but on the bland side, not what you'd call passionate or engrossing, but gentle and introspective. Romantic dilemmas and stepchildren figure highly in these stories. I prefer the stepchildren stories which point out that although the children suffer in a divorce, their parents aren't exactly having a day at the beach, either. I really enjoyed this book and will seek out Ms. Robinson's other book of stories, ""A Glimpse of Scarlet"", which sounds from th e description as if it wlll be equally enjoyable."
4,Turkish Traditional Tunes: An ARC Anthology,"This anthology of Turkish music, taken from the catalogue of ARC, closes with Ensemble Hüseyin Türkmenler's dance piece so alluring that it appears in Rough Guide's own anthology. The music heard is more traditional, of folk dances and gypsy tunes, than either Putumayo's and Rough Guide's more popular collections. Although limited, the album of nearly one hour duration still is varied with songs and instrumentals, and the various musical groups and regional styles from the Aegean, the Black Sea, and Anatolian highlands keep our ears alert. Türkmenler's ensemble dominates the selections. Because Turkish rhythms are strong and challenging, this album serves as a good introduction to this musical crossroads."
5,Way to go!,"I just want to say that Bellyqueen should be so proud of their DVD. I put it in the other day and did the entire thing and I loved it! I just think it is great and I love the light-hearted feel to it, clearness of instruction and that I just had fun doing it without getting bored. It is truly different from other videos on the market and I will definately recommend to my students. Way to go!"
2,"great for moves, but not for workout","You do really learn the hip movements easily, and the girls look great with their trendy little outfits, but this IS NOT a workout video! They teach a small dance routine that's similar to some sort of line dance, where you actually turn after each completion. This is difficult for beginners, as 3/4 of the time you are turned away from the television. In addition, as many other views have stated, there is not enough workout content to make this dvd worth my while. I've had great success with the Island Girl Hula DVD's which teach many similar hip movements at a slow pace while also providing a great workout."
5,Will get you up and movin'!!,"I own several bellydance DVDs and wish I had purchased this one sooner. This is an excellent and well paced bellydance workout for beginners. I can tell they put a lot of thought into what should be included in this DVD. Bellydance instruction is successfully integrated into the workout. I am a plus size and I felt comfortable with the pace. The music alone makes you want to get up groove and it doesn't hurt that they included a separate music CD. You get a lot for your money with this one: Instruction, workout, interviews, performances, cccccccd."
3,"Ok, but kinda boring","Good for learning how to tie steps together if you want to dance on the floor in some nightclub, but that's about it. Watched it once, I'm over it.....and I'm a bellydancer."
5,Living room fun!,"I was a bit skeptical when buying this DVD but one session killed all doubts. This DVD is so much fun! It's easy to follow and by the time you're in the BQ Boogie, you're really shimmying and strutting! The technique section is about 35 minutes with a warm-up and a cool down so it's convenient for a quick workout in your living room."
1,Kathy Smith is better,"The instruction is good and the tips on how to incorporate the simple routine into a 4 step dance is okay which earn the dvd a 1 from me, but overall, I found the workout slow and simplistic with no sweat whatsoever. If you want a good bellydance instructional base as well as a good workout combined with a dance you can learn, buy the Kathy Smith Flex Appeal Bellydance workout. You'll learn the basic moves from Superstar Ansuya and get a good workout from an exercise instructor who is a guru in the industry."
2,Trash says it all.,"It took quite a long time to receive this by parcel post. When it finally did come in we had forgotten we even ordered the thing.They only reason I bought it was that I, and my drama club, were extras while it was filmed at my high school (North Marion High). It was so peiced together that Jamie Pressley wasn't even in the movie orginally."
5,Great Book!,"I have met people who have taken up photography seriously after reading this book.For anyone who appreciates anything from John Muir, you will love the beauty that Galen Rowell'sphotography adds to an already work of art. The book was in good shape and a real find. Thanks"
3,Pie in the Sky Pomo,"Encountering Development represents what has become an unfortunate growth industry in the 1980s abd 1990s: postmdodern critiques of the development industry. Escobar presents some stimulating criticisms of the whole development paradigm along with an assortment of critiques so abstract and jargon-ridden that it is difficult to understand what he and his compratriots actually mean. It is hard to argue that development efforts to date have measured up to what has been promised. But what is lacking in this book--as in most other works of this kind--are realistic, coherent and practical suggestions for alternatives."
2,Anger does not equal analysis,"This is a tract, not a thoughtful piece of scholarship. It is in the Latin American school of angry social science, but is little informed by fact. Much of what it says is correct, but is also well known. But the analysis is weak, based on incorrect or outdated data, and simply a regurgitation of stereotypes instead of a deductive grounded analysis based upon good ethnographic work. It is therefore often simply wrong. But anger sells books....."
2,"Not my cup of tea, or hero.","Maybe I am just a sucker for the strong, alpha male types, but I had a hard time liking Nick Pryce, Viscount Somerton. He begins the book as a serious wastrel and ends the book still not up to my standards of hero. I just never bought that Willie would be drawn to a man who kidnapped her, humiliated her in front of a bunch of strangers, and then allows her to become a servant in his home. I'm sorry, but I just did not get the attraction. Sure, he was cute, but there have to be better men out there.Despite my problems with the ""hero"" of ""The Viscount's Bawdy Bargain,"" it did have some nice moments and some fun characters, especially the Cyprians turned chambermaids, the alleged poisoner turned chef, and the pugilist turned valet. These saved the book from the donation bin before I had finished it.Overall, not my favorite hero or book. I'm willing to give Connie Lane another shot, but this book is definitely not a keeper."
3,Average,"I loved The Duke's Scandalous Secret, which I read first, but the first in the series lacks a good deal. It has some extremely nice moments and contains a number of ""life truths."" It was mostly the ending that failed to live up to standards; the reader is not quite convinced of the depth of Nick's feelings for Willie. The unusual secondary characters do make for some interesting moments, but the Duke of Ravensfield (book 2) is often more interesting than this book's hero. It's lighthearted and sometimes amusing, but doesn't fully mesh as a whole and lacks the depth of honest emotion that the best books contain."
3,Glad to see them still around after 40 years,"I chose this DVD over their latest CD called The Well's On Fire. Good choice! My review of the new CD mentions how dismal their new stuff is, which is quite easy to see with the set list being a mixture of old and new. I am not one to be nostalgic for thir glory days, but the only new song that does anything for me is The Signature by Matthew Fisher. There are also seven other new songs on this DVD.The star of the show is Geoff Whitehorn, who is really a very talented guitarist. I also had more fun trying to read the captions on his two T-shirts (one for each set) than paying attention to the rest of the band. Don't get me wrong, this is a stellar group of musicians, but Geoff is just more entertaining to watch. Gary's voice is truly amazing, especially after all these years.Other highlights include A Salty Dog, Conquistador, and the reggae interlude for As Strong As Samson."
2,This re-release is an affront to Procol fans,"The low rating is for the manner of re-release only. This is nothing but a brazen attempt by Eagle to get PH fans to buy the dvd a second time in order to get the cd version which, based on the information above, is only available with the dvd and cannot be purchased separately. If you are a Procol fan what choice do you have but to purchase the dvd a second time? I understand they are re-releasing Jethro Tull's Isle of Wight dvd w/ the cd also, but at least in that case you can buy each separately.I have the dvd and it is fine, I have no complaints with it at all. A 4 star dvd by itself."
3,Quality inconsistent,"First time I ordered, the quality was very good and the product worked pretty well. Second time it was like a diluted version of the product ordered before and of course it did not work so well. What happened to the consistency in quality?"
3,Nice product but has side effects.,"The product is good but I had issues when using it. Because of the specific smell and I guess chemical composition, I had a very bad headache and dizziness first time I used it."
3,Interesting,"Basically, Vallee takes his own theories on what UFOs are all about and slots them into a ""fictional"" account. (Like that other ""fiction"" book ALIEN RAPTURE). Vallee is big on deception, the idea that aliens aren't really alien at all but something else and are tricking us into thinking so.The ideas are interesting, but as a story, the book is kind of lame."
1,The arrogant French #2,This might have been great if it had had sub-titles. The french seem to think their language is perfect and everybody ought to know it - I can do some Spanish but trying to follow a french movie without sub-titles is really hard for me. Same for German movies - I understand Mein Fader - but you can't do a whole movie with only those words.
3,Not quite royal blue,"I ordered this product to use in making new posters for my classroom. It arrived in great condition and when promised. It is not Royal Blue, more like sky blue. I think it can work but I'm going to have to reprint some of the things I had planned to put on a Royal Blue background."
4,Great dvd.... extremely pricey,"Well this dvd is going to improve your playing technique a lot if you use it regularly... the exercises are not revolutionary, but they are none the less great to do. The only complaint I have besides John's ridiculously, ugly guitar, is that the dvd is very, very expensive. So I would definately suggest buying it used or at a discounted price from one of the individual amazon sellers.You really can not go wrong with this if you take the time to go through it, because when I first got this I was like what in the world is this [..], but once I took the time to go through it I was really impressed with how much these practice techniques help."
2,Humm Drumm,"Not much here. Just same ol practice techniques like sweep picking, patterns, etc. The stuff that's on EVERY guitar video. Buy Rockhouse Videos instead. They show you stuff you can use NOW."
2,bla,"so many people are jocking this dvd! i just got it, and i hate it! It was such a waste of $50.You really don't learn much from this dvd. he shows you 2 or 3 techniques and that's it. I wish if i could return it. This dvd has nothing on tony mcalpine's instuctional video, and that was made in the 80s!all the extra are meant for you to only watch it once, BORING.petrucci cant' touch vai or satriani EVER.wish if i could return ""rock discipline."" Tehre are too many ass kissing going on for this dvd, it's not fair to those that haven't bought it yet. false representation indeed!"
1,Nice Cover but content is not for the grieving husband.,"This book trys to convey what grief is like through metaphors. I'm sorry my wife dieing is not the same as Bob's mother throwing away his old clothes and getting him new ones. Nor is it like drops of water being afraid to go over a water falls. Mr. Vogt turns to religion . I've read most of the book and his wife is not mentioned in it. He calls her""something""."
1,Lethal Target - PORN version of Alien,Lethal Target is a BAD R-XXX-B movie. It is just BAD. If I could give it 'NO STARS' I would. This is more of a porn film than a sci-fi film. Absolutely not for minors. Even the little Sci-fi parts were really Bad! AVOID at all costs (even free).
3,"O.k. for learning, but there are free ones out there.","I bought this for a friend. It's very in depth, too in depth for that matter. It like a college course for how to make toast."
4,"Fun - incoherent, but fun","There's a lot going on here, and not a lot for the newbie to cling to. Maybe that doesn't matter, though.The artwork is veried and enjoyable - most of it is harsh, angluar penwork with limited use of color, but parts of it verge on the painterly.Story? Well, that's a problem. There are lots of one-page vignettes and a brief but cryptic story near the end. Robots abound, of course - for family fun, combat, and just about everything else. And, of course, there are endless adult entertainment opportunities, more hinted at than shown.Maybe this series depends on continuity from one issue to the next, so any one snapshot of the series looks disjoint. The artwork is good enough to pull me back to see if that's the case. I enjoy the style, but I'm still looking for substance.//wiredweird"
2,It left me wanting.....,"Yes. This is just an overview showing just the parts and techniques used for installation. I wanted to know more about the where to get the actual parts (i.e. batteries, step-by-step details about doing it myself, hooking up the wires, costs expended). I felt it was definitely informative, but I wanted more information on the products."
4,The difficulties of being rich,"Oh yes, laugh if you will but it is very hard being very, very, wealthy. I inherited millions of dollars from my late father and was adrift in what I should do every day. On top of that, I am a very handsome man. A double scorn, if you will. This means that I do not know if the women who wish to be my friends are true 'friends' or are only after my money and/or good looks. This book changed my life! I am only giving it 4 stars because there is no chapter on dealing with being very, very good looking."
3,"News flash: ""money doesn't buy happiness"" isn't news","The ""editorial review"" breathlessly states:""Thayer Willis shines a light into an area seldom thought about, let alone addressed, in our materialistic culture.In 'Navigating the Dark Side of Wealth,' Ms. Willis details the pitfalls that great wealth can lead people into: the morally corrupting and emotionally stunting effects that having material riches can cause, and the pain and heartache that ensue.""Huh? What planet is this ""editorial"" reviewer from? Wealth might mot be a ticket to happiness (or satisfaction, or peace, or whatever) but how silly to say this is ""seldom thought about."" In fact, quite the opposite. The assumption almost ALWAYS is that wealth is corrupting and empty.I'd like to see a book that says ""I'm rich, and it's great!!""Now THAT would be ""an area seldom thought about."""
5,Navigating the Dark Side of Wealth,"Robert Coles and Thayer Willis have something important in common - they are content to let people tell their stories and not feel the need for the author to tell us what the story really means. We are all used to having authors with books about real people try to make the people more (or less) interesting than they are but both Coles and Willis have the security and integrity to let the stories and the people themselves talk through them. This book could have been about explaining the unintentionally rich aka ""inheritors"" or working to make us pity, respect or excuse them. Instead, Thayer is content to let them tell their own stories as real people - which is hard for anyone caught up in being part of a cultural myth - the rich. I appreciated the thoroughness and the attention to each individual story. An inheritance can be a gift and not just an inevitable curse."
3,Not just for the wealthy,"Not just for the wealthy, Willis accurately describes the situation of young middle-class Americans born into a society of abundance. Her description of the Agression - Assertiveness - Passivity continuum and struggle we middle-classers' seem to have with entitlement was worth the book alone.Willis case-study style makes each chapter enjoyable and easy to read."
1,excellent door stop/paper weight,"Failed within weeks with vertical white stripes. Sent in under warranty and ""repaired"". I haven't used it much since the repair (so no longer under repair warranty), but now it has failed again with the same white stripe problem. Optoma says now must repair on my dime, which is min $160. Good luck if you decide to go with Optoma!"
3,decent projector,The projector is fairly small. The build quality isn't great. (Cheap flimsy plastics) It is bright and works okay. I wouldn't suggest it for a classroom
5,"If you have family working in the penal system, read it!","Jerome Washington gives you a human outlook on societies ""inhuman"" population. It is a good read. If you have family in the penal system, on either side of the bars, you will have a different outlook on what they endure."
3,A Decent Effort,"The videos included are great, but it's missing essentials. The most obvious, where is ""Tell Me Where It Hurts""?? It's not as if Kathy has too many videos to fit on one DVD, they should all be on here."
1,Dissociation,"""People who are dissociated live in great peace. But this is only because they have blocked their negative feelings. The enlightened person resolves his negatives feelings, and thus his peace is not false."""
5,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!,"Simple to read, yet full of powerful ideas, this is one of the best books by Barry Neil Kaufman. I keep my copy nearby, so I can dip back into it, and re-read sections often."
4,perfect fit,"Lock set arrived early, and it was not damaged. It went in perfectly, and all parts were complete. I would definetly buy another."
4,Perfect Replacement Part,"This perfectly replaced the aging atrium door hardware that I had on my current patio door. The only downside is that the parts are no longer made in the USA. Still, the action is smooth and the brass is bright."
5,Great product,"This product was top quality - an exact duplicate of original almost 30 year old hardware, simple to install - it took less than 15 minutes - old hardware was already removed!!"
4,Good quality for made in china,Replaced my old unit perfectly. Only difference are the handles are 1 piece with the hardware. My old one was attached with screws that were always coming loose.
5,Excellent Piece of Gear,"After 25 years plus..my Atrium door lock jammed. Went to Home Depot and Lowes no luck. Called a locksmith 125 to come out and he'd need to order it. Got online and Walla...Read the reviews and was so happy decided to put in my 2 cents or rather 100 bucks. Its is a really nice piece of gear. Heavy, Well Made, Exact Replacement. It is so nice to find a well made quality product at a nice price. The only deal was it was a Bytche to get out the old frozen in allen keys on the old one.You can't exactly use a torch top heat the metal allen key area as the door will go up in smoke. I went out and got a metal saw and sawzalled out the dead bolt and all. My unit failed with the door locked and closed..it wouldn't open back up. Okie Dokie be nice to other living things..always be learning, listening and loving"
3,Lock assembly,Door assembly was a real quality product. I enjoyed working with it and thought it looked great installed.Other recommended sites showed a similar product but it was important I replaced like for like for my customer.
4,lock set,"visited local hardware store where I purchased the door in 1991 for a new lockset.was told they no longer deal with that brand any longer, said they'd have to researchthe product and see what they can come up with.I said, well I can do that, so, here I sit with a new lock set. Thank You, Frank."
3,Hard and Good Game,I have played this game since it came out. But I can't get past the level/stage of 10-3. Has anyone out there beat that level? If so e-mail me the password for whatever stage is next and hurry. I'm frusterated. E-mail me at geoffg88@onwisconsin.com. Thanks.Rated: T for Teen for violence.
1,Talk about offbeat,Hawkins seems to struggle behind the piano. He should explore more music through out the world if he plans on being successful.
2,Deflated! and not very long.,"This pillow is not that great. The pillow is not all that full. The cover is rough, and thick, also the stuffing was all over the outside of the pillow. Although I couldn't find any holes in the pillow itself it was worrisome. In addition the pillow is not as long as advertised. I am 5 feet tall and it was not long enough for me."
4,Just buy it already! So you can get some sleep...,"I read reviews on several pregnancy pillows before settling on this one. Some describe a sharp seam that digs into your neck/shoulder. This pillow does not have that. It is giant and literally takes up one half of a king size bed, but SO worth it. The pillow cover may need a few wash cycles to soften the material depending on the thread count you are used to. Because it surrounds your body on both sides, it can get a bit warm but I started using it in august and I live in south Texas. Once it gets below 100 degrees outside I thnk it will be just fine. It is worth the $ so you are able to get a good night's sleep. Buy it before you really need it!"
4,My wife loves this pillow,She loves this pillow and it made me look very thoughtful to buy this for her. She is only 15 weeks but it has helped her sleep better already. It does have a smell to it when you first take it out of the plastic but after a few hours it is fine.
5,Best. Pillow. Ever,"My first review on amazon.com, which we use very often, and I cannot say enough good about this pillow. Although cumbersome when not in use, it has improved my sleep immensely. I was prepared for poor sleep and discomfort typical of my prior pregnancies as the months passed. I wish I had this with my first two. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to increase the odds of a good night's rest in the later stages of pregnancy. I'm curious how it will work out as a nursing support, after baby arrives."
5,Not just for Pregnant Women,My wife has had back and hip issues for years and I was hoping that this might be a solution for her to snuggle with in bed. She always has to prop up one leg on a pillow to relieve stress on her low back. Pillows just don't work over a long time. She has taken this pregnancy pillow and cocooned herself in it giving her the needed leg prop on one side and the back support on the other when she's on her side. She also used it on the couch giving her her lower back support but also coming around to the front on her lap to give her arm support. She says she loves it and that it's comfy. So for those with back issues this might be a solution for you for temporary relief in bed and on the couch.
5,Loving it,"I am really nervous about spending money on myself so this was a hard purchase to make but it's helping. I wish I would have bought it sooner but didn't spring for it until 7 months. I thought that I could do the same job with pillows that we already had (and save the money), but it's really so hard to move around at this point-- let alone shuffle a bunch of pillows around-- in bed with the big ole belly, every little bit helps. I didn't start using until the weather turned cooler since everyone warned how hot it gets. I am definitely hotter than everyone else in the house, especially since I started using the pillow."
2,it's ok...,So my husband got me this as a surprise the same day I ordered mine. Read the fine print it's NOT RETURNABLE!! I however stopped the delivery of mine and 5 weeks later still have not been reimbursed. anyways...this pillow was amazing THE FIRST WEEK. Then slowly it started to DEFLATE like all other pillows out there. The first thing to go was the top middle. I had to add my own pillow for head support. The second was the ends where I rest my legs. For the money I paid this thing should have lasted my entire pregnancy but it didn't last even a couple of weeks. I should have just kept investing in crappy pillows and gotten the same outcome.
1,can not return when you feel it's not good,"long time sleep with this pillow make me can not feel my arm, it's really not comfortable.even bad, you can not return it.. by their policy.it's just waste of money."
2,Uncomfortable Design,We bought it for my wife who is in her second trimester. And she has to sleep on her sides but with the design of this pillow it was very difficult for her to change sides.
3,Not as fantastic as I had hoped.,"My husband bought this pillow as an early Christmas present for me. I got it a couple weeks ago and have been using it nightly since. It is an ideal shape for the side-sleeping required in pregnancy. However, it is not as puffy as it appears in the photo. At first I thought it was because it arrived crammed into a box when it was shipped to us, and that it would puff back up. However, after sleeping on it for only 2 or 3 weeks, it is already flatter then before. The head portion in particular is too flat to provide the kind of support a regular side-sleeping pillow would provide. I am only 4 months along, so I can only imagine how flat it will be by the time I am 9 months along. Other than that, the concept and shape are ideal, just wish it was thicker and thought that for the price, it would be a better quality."
3,"Comfy, but a burden if you turn sides a lot like me...","This pillow is indeed comfy; however, I change sides frequently during the night and it was harder to turn with this pillow vs. turning myself and my regular body pillow together. Also, though it feels great when you first lay with it, I found that my arm/shoulder fell asleep after a short time.Overall, I think this is a nice pillow but on the first night I used it I changed back to my regular body pillow half way thru the night and was so thankful I had left it close by. Sadly you can't return the pillow, even after one half night, so I'm stuck with it."
4,comfortable,"My wife loves her pillow. It is very comfortable and she sleeps very soundly in it. In fact, she likes to stay in bed more often now and naps in her bed instead of on the couch. I on the other hand wish I had a king size bed. In a queen, the pillow takes up 2/3 of the bed and I just don't have the room I once had. I am not a snuggler when I sleep, so it has taken some time for me to learn to sleep on my side. Overall I would give the product an A."
4,Much better than Pregnancy Boppy,"Originally I purchased the Pregancy Boppy b/c I was uncomfortable sleeping. After a couple of weeks, the boppy was flimsy and just wasn't holding me securely and my back was KILLLLING me!A friend suggested the Today's Mom Comfort Pillow and while I was hesitant to spend MORE money on another pillow, I am SO GLAD I DID!This pillow supports my belly and my back.It can be used either way, with the closed part at my head or at my feet...it makes rolling over much easier and I have honestly slept much better (still not perfect!) through the night!"
5,Best Maternity Investment Ever!,"I never purchased a maternity pillow for my first pregnancy, and I slept horribly the entire time. I am a back sleeper, so sleeping on my side is extremely uncomfortable anyway. I thought I'd take a chance with this pillow. AMAZING! I've been using it for 5 months and love it! It wedges me on my side so I don't roll forward or backward. It gets a little warm in the summer, but it was great in the winter. It also takes up a bit of the bed, but not too bad (we have a Queen-size). I highly recommend this pillow for anyone concerned about sleeping while pregnant. It was the best maternity investment I could have made."
1,Misrepresented - Not comfortable,I ordered this pillow and was shocked when I opened the box and found that it is almost completely flat. It appears full in the photo but it is actually more than half as flat as advertised. I tried using it but it provides no support for your back at all. It would need to be stuffed further with additional materials. Total waste of money and company would not allow me to return it. They take advantage of pregnant women...they should be ashamed to sell a crappy product and not care about their customers.
3,It's ok,It was very comfortable the 1st 2 weeks. The pillow started to lose its fullness. Now it feels like there is nothing between my legs. It does help keep hubby away so his tossing an Turing does not hit the baby.
1,Not Returnable!,"This pillow is not nearly as ""full"" as it looks in the photo and I was disappointed. I was even more disappointed to learn that it's not returnable! The return policy is buried at the end of the product description. I won't order anything from this company again.On the bright side, my dog loves this pillow."
1,don't buy this comfort pillow as it is very uncomfortable,This pillow is very uncomfortable. I requested seller to return this product but they are not ready to accept return as per their policy. So please read this review before you spend this costly pillow. It is very very uncomfortable for pregnant woman.
3,Too short,"I am 5'6"". I do have longer legs. This is my second pregnancy and I had a different pillow for my first. Although this pillow is comfortable and supportive, it was too short! It barely came down to my knees and this was really wedging my shoulder into the top. If you are short, you are going to LOVE this pillow.Also, we co-sleep. I couldn't comfortably fit my toddler and husband into our king bed with this huge thing. Something to keep in mind. AND I will breastfeed this next baby--where would I possibly put him if we layed down to nurse? I would have to remove the pillow. Ah well, I will be returning this and will continue to look."
4,Todays Mom Cozy Comfort Pregnancy Pillow,"The pillow pictured is a good representation of size. I'm 5ft-6in and my feet hang off the ends of the pillow. I wish it were a foot longer, but it has made sleeping much more comfortable. I have a Cal-King which is smaller in width than a king. The pillow doesn't over crowd the bed. One reviewer noted that there was no pillow case. The zippered cover, although not very soft is washable. Because of the pillow my nights are more restful. I'm happy with this purchase."
3,Good pillow for early pregnancy,"I purchased this pillow to help relieve heartburn and hip pain during pregnancy. I used it a few times and found it to be quite comfortable. It's very large. I'm 5'9"" and it fits me perfectly. My husband complains it takes up too much room in our queen size bed (at least half of the bed). I would recommend this pillow for early pregnancy. Since the end of my second and now my third trimester I have found the pillow to be extremely difficult to get out of. After the first few times I tossed the pillow aside and haven't used it since."
3,It's Okay,"I really couldn't wait to get this pillow but when I got it, it wasn't what I expected. It might of been cause I didn't get that big but it was more int he way."
5,perfect for my pregnant wife!,Fits her body perfect and she uses it everywhere! Got 45 miles from home and she forgot it. Needless to say we were 2 hours late :)
1,very disappointed!!,"Do not waste your money on this pillow! I am highly disappointed after receiving and using it. I had high hopes that this would solve my sleeping discomforts, based upon the reviews. However, it is nothing like what the positive reviews say. It is fairly flat and should be stuffed MUCH more, especially for the price. Since it is flimsy, it moves way too much, and I am constantly having to readjust it. I have had to use several other pillows with it, and it continues to flatten more every day. I am seriously debating whether to return this product because of my disappointment. Try another pillow, if you are looking for quality - this is NOT a good one!"
2,Under stuffed Pillow Not As Good As It Lokks,This pillow has no where near enough stuffing. Your head is pretty much on the mattress immediately. Plus the fabric finish smell is really strong and doesn't seem to fade. Getting a smaller option that just supports your belly and goes through your legs is a better idea.
1,Beware-NO RETURNS!,"I bought this pillow on the recommendation of a friend, and immediately found it too soft when I took it out of the box. I tried to return it before I even used it, and was informed it was NOT returnable. When I asked how I would know that, I was directed to a series of links that led me to a very buried return policy. Don't buy it unless you're sure! I spent $70 and I still can't sleep, and I will probably have to buy something else instead."
1,Extremely uncomfortable and too bulky,My husband and I share a queen size bed and this pillow took up most of the bed. It was too bulky and left kinks in my neck. I wish I had never purchased it. I tried it one night and then put it back in the box. That is how much I hated it.
5,The best pregnancy pillow ever!!,"I had the regular ""Body Pillow"" during my first pregnancy but this one is so much better! It cradles my front, back and head allowing me to get a goods night rest! I understand the complaints others have made about it not being good for really tall women but I have to say, if it helps your back, head and belly you should try this pillow! There isn't anything I would change about this pillow."
4,Body Pillow,"I am 6 months pregnant and have had many sleepless nights and back pain. I saw this product and really liked the reviews it had overall. At first I thought it was a bit pricey but decided to try it anyway. Overall it is a great pillow; it's comfortable and really eased my back pain and make sleeping much better throughout the night. The only Con I find to this pillow is that its casing material is a bit ruff and the pillow could be a little fluffier. However, overall it was a wonderful investment. Money well spent."
3,huge!,This was comfortable but huge. My husband couldn't sleep in our queen bed when I used it. You need a cal king with this thing but it did give me support for my belly and doesn't go flat.
2,"Great at first, until it deflates.","Warning: you cannot return this item. I thought it was the best thing ever when I first got it. Provided excellent support, and my back felt way better. After just a month of using it, though, the stuffing material deflated and redispursed in to areas that weren't being supported. I still use the pillow, but I have to put other pillows where the head is and where the back support used to be, and it's not very comfortable anymore. I am sad that I have no money to invest in a better pillow. Please do not trust all the good reviews.. Many are written by people who haven't been using the pillow for very long."
3,Thought it would be better,"I bought this pillow based on the high reviews. It's not a bad pillow, but it definitely isn't as great as I was expecting! The first couple weeks with it, it was amazing! But then, all the fluff started to flatten and no matter how hard I try to fluff it back up, nothing seems to work. Also, the top where you would put your head, the stuffing seems to be separating, so there's little to no support for your neck and head. I started waking up with horrible headaches from bad support, so I have started using a thin pillow lain on top of the pregnancy pillow for extra support. And I have tried to push the stuffing back together in that area, it doesn't work. Overall, it's not a bad pillow, but not necessarily for the price. It works good enough that I will continue to use it through the rest of my pregnancy."
1,WARNING: NOT RETURNABLE,"I bought this product based on all of the positive reviews, but when I got it, I tried it out really quickly and realized that it was COMPLETELY uncomfortable for me. The pillow felt like it was half-filled with cushioning and did not actually provide me with any support. The next day, I contacted Amazon to attempt to return the item and have been notified that it is NOT RETURNABLE. I did not read down to the last sentence of the description where it states that it is NOT RETURNABLE. The question being, how can you know if you will like a pillow if you have to buy it to try it and then CANNOT RETURN it? Suffice it to say, I have an extra pillow now that is COMPLETELY UNUSED and USELESS and which I am completely out of $ for. I do not recommend this item."
1,save your money,"I did a lot of looking around before I settled on this product. I was so excited when it arrived. I couldn't wait for bedtime just so I could try it out. I was disappointed when I spent most of the night repositioning and manipulating this cumbersome pillow. Out of despiration, I had a co-worker modify it (remove the head and neck part). It still didn't work for me. I used it a total of 4 nights; I mean 4 sleep less nights! Just get extra pillows or a body pillow at the store. This pillow is not worth it!"
4,Answered Prayer!,"This pillow was an answer to my sleepless night prayers. It has completely prevented me from waking up in the middle of the night on my tummy which, while I was assured would not hurt the baby, scared me as a 1st time mom. (Especially as my tummy began to expand.) It is enormous but I sleep in a King size bed and there is plenty of room for me and my husband who, occasionally throws his leg over the back of it too. The only reason I didn't give it a 5star rating is that I've only had it for about a month and it seems as if I am constantly having to fluff it up. I think I expected it to be a little bit firmer but to me, that is a small price to pay for it's benefits. I recently brought this pillow on a retreat and wore it into the lodge wrapped around me like a fur stole. It garnered a ton of ""ooohs"" and ""aaahs"" from many strangers asking where they might find one. Needless to say, this pillow will be sticking around even after baby comes. It's comfort was well worth the price paid!"
3,"Better than using regular pillows, but goes flat quickly","I have used pregnancy pillow for about a month now, and it looks nothing like the profile picture here on Amazon. I can't believe how flat it has gotten in just one month. I still say it's better than using three regular pillows each night and then having to flip them all when you toss and turn. I even say it's better than a regular body pillow because it's softer and I like the pillow part that connects the two longer parts. However, if you're looking for a lot of support, you may want to look elsewhere."
2,"Too big, felt trapped. Huge pregnancy pillow.","If you're anything like me, you like to change positions while you sleep. This pillow makes it very hard to do. I'm 5'3 100 lbs so maybe that has something to do with it, but I felt swallowed in this thing and unable to get comfortable. I'd much rather have a simple wedge sponge for under my belly, a normal body pillow for my leg and arm, and my usual pillow for my head. The product is exactly how it seems, so my review is more of a personal comfort standpoint. Plus there is absolutely no way to cuddle when this beast is in your bed. The pillow also arrived with a tear in it. I sent it back and they refunded the money. I'm now 36 weeks and still just using pillows we already have, including a body pillow. But I really wish I would've bought a wedge."
3,not as i expected,"MY PRODUCT ARRIVED ON TIME WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS. BUT THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT WASN'T SO GREAT.IT WAS FLAT WITHIN NO TIME VERY DISAPPOINTING. SO I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.THIS ISN'T AMAZONS FAULT, I LOVE AMAZON YOU JUST HAVE TO SELECT THE RIGHT PRODUCT IM NOT EVEN SAYING THE SELLER WAS BAD IM SAYING THE PRODUCT WASN'T WHAT I EXSPECTED."
3,It's not as fluffy as it looks!,"I purchased this pillow because I was experiencing a lot of hip pain during this pregnancy. I typically use a body pillow, but it just wasn't cutting it. While this did help with the hip pain, it's definitely not the quality of pillow you would expect to receive for the price. I've been using it for two months now and it's already really flat. When it arrived in the box, it wasn't that fluffy. If you look at the photos, they make the curved top part where your head rests look really structured - IT'S NOT! It feels like cheap fiber fill and it is not at all as full as the photos they're showing. After only a month I had to start using other pillows along with this one. Kind of defeats the purpose."
2,Too big,I'm early on in my pregnancy and already have back pain so I purchased this pillow to relieve my aching back and keep me on my side. I woke up several times during the night on my back and with the pillow almost off the bed. It is way too big for a queen size bed and I don't like that you can't use your own pillow. I tried to turn it around and put my pillow on top but one of the legs fell off the bed in the middle of the night. It also elevated my pillow too high. I'm taking this product back and getting something smaller.
1,Uncomfortable Product- Do not buy,"This product looks good on picture but not at all comfortable in reality. There is no place for the other arm which is underneath your body. This caused tremendous stress and my wife now has back-ache and neck pain after using it for 1 time. The worst thing is that company would not replace it due to ""hygiene"" but the fact is that it has a cover which can easily be replaced and the product can still be replaced. Also, its much softer in reality than what it looks in picture, so, you won't really get that much gap between the legs. I would not recommend this product and would have to go with some different brand now!http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001A0K43M/ref=pe_175190_21431760_C1_cs_sce_3p_dp_1"
3,Comfy,"The pillow is very comfy, but I have a hard time with it if I want to use my covers. If I I need to roll over in the middle of the night the sheets seem to get tangled up between the pillow. Also like some others said it is kind of noisy when you move."
4,Good but Bulky,"This pillow works great, but I really didn't anticipate the size. I love the fact that it's big enough that I don't have to move the pillow every time I change sides. The head part of this pillow is a little flat for me so I use a regular pillow on top. As I stated before, the size was a little larger than anticipated. We have a king size bed and my husband says he feels like he's in outer Siberia when I use the pillow."
4,"Good price, decent quality","I am about 7 months pregnant and am 5'3"". I say this because I think your body dimensions make a difference in how you like this pillow. It fits me great, and I have been much more comfortable since I got it. It was shipped pretty quickly and it seems to be of a good quality. I've been sleeping on it for about a month.The only downside is that it is really big. My husband and I have a double bed and he really cannot sleep in the bed with me when I am in this pillow. I imagine it would work fine in a queen or king size bed."
1,Not returnable,"I recieved this pillow and was really excited about it. It had great reviews so I was hoping it would be great. I only ended up sleeping on it for about 3 hours before I got sick of it and switched back to the pillows I was using before. For me it was not right because I did not feel like it was stuffed well enough to be supportive. I like my support pillows fairly firm. And the neck portion gave me a crick in the neck. I'm not sure why it did, I think it put my neck at a wrong angle. However this was not (for me) the worst thing. Because it is sold by a seller and not by amazon it is subject to the seller's return policy and this seller will not accept any returns on any pregnancy pillows. Therefore I was stuck trying to get rid of this pillow that holds absolutely no value for me. I resold it on ebay but I am still out some money because of sellers fee and shipping. So unless you know for sure you will like this pillow I would not suggest buying it here because you cannot return it."
2,Gets way too hot,"I purchased this pillow after reading the great reviews because my lower back started to hurt in my second trimester. Personally, this pillow was way too hot to sleep with. I guess it would be ok if you live in colder climates or will be pregnant during cooler months.This pillow insulates your entire body so I ended up just overheating at night. I bought a wedge to put between my legs and put one pillow at my back and another long one in front and now I sleep much more comfortably. I could have saved myself the money on this purchase.Be careful purchasing this item too because they do not accept returns on pillows! So if you don't like it you are stuck with it or have to ebay it."
1,Don't be fooled by the reviews!,"The pillow is not comfortable at all, the texture, the shape, the size, etc. It gives me neck and shoulder pain! And it's way too HOT that I had to switch back to my old pillow in the middle of the night. More important is, the seller's return policy is insane and that's why I'm writing this review to let you all know!"
1,Low quality and uncomfortable,"I was so disappointed when I received this product. The pillow itself is made out of cheap materials (regular pillow fill, and a scratchy mesh casing), and the pillow case is rough and plastic feeling. I did not find that it provided the support that it promised. The space at the top of the pillow is very narrow and my shoulders felt trapped in it. I tried several nights to sleep using this pillow, and each night I ended up replacing it with my regular pillows instead. Note that this company doesn't accept returns on pregnancy pillows, so make sure this is what you want before you make your purchase."
4,Much more comfortable for arthritics,"I have had arthritis for five years now. It's hard for me to be comfortable sleeping. This pillow makes it so much easier to sleep and be comfortable. It supports in the right areas without leaving sore knees touching. The knee pillows don't stay with me and are too thick. I tried a different one of these type pillows. But, the curve where the neck goes was stitched too tightly. This one has a very comfortable curve that doesn't cut into your neck or shoulder. I change sides during the night and it was nice to know the other side was right there waiting for me. I am a heavy person and the support for lower back and belly is appreciated, too. The only down side is that the pillow is a little ""crunchy"" sounding. I'm hoping with use, that will be more quiet. The cover on this ones goes on and off much easier than the other one I had."
3,a bit too big for a petite person,"Like the other reviewers said, this pillow is huge! I'm 5'0"" tall, so I am about as long as this pillow. I bought this when I was about 20 weeks along because I needed something to support my belly. At the time it was just too big for that and it was easier if I placed a towel under my belly while I slept on my side. It also caused me to sleep in weird angles and I would wake up with a backache, so I stopped using it for awhile. Now that I am 28 weeks it seems to work much better. The pillow curves in to support your inner back and under your belly. I try to push each side inward as much as I can so that I don't roll over on my back but I am as wide as the gap so sometimes I end up rolling a lot. It does keep me (and my husband) really warm on those cold nights and I expect that as I get further along that I will fill into the pillow curves much better."
5,Very comforting,"I highly recommend this pillow. Don't bother with single body pillows - you will be constantly lugging it from side to side as you turn or get out of bed. The sides on this pillow easily fold up. The head pillow is not too firm or high, unlike some of the other models. It is like sleeping in a supportive cloud. The only thing I would change is the fabric of the pillowcase - if you're used to 100% cotton, the poly blend will feel slightly sub-par."
3,"VERY BIG PILLOW, takes up more than half of a queen sized bed","Ive waited three weeks to be able to properly review this item. Gotta say ... I had high hopes for this pillow, but it was mostly a letdown. I would have returned it if I could have! Its just WAY too big and stiff!! I was 5'8"" 135lbs. prepregnancy, now 145 lbs @ 17 weeks (for comparisons sake) So Im not a tiny girl in general, but the pillow is totally HUGMONGOUS (thick, mostly stiff, long and wide)!! The cover on the pillow is kinda scratchy also ( maybe it gets softer if you wash, but I havent tried). Now I just use it to keep my feel elevated during that day .. as I am on bedrest. :("
1,no return,"no return, too high, very unsatisfied, should never buy this product. And most important thing is we cannot return this product and get our money back"
1,Don't order this unless you try one first,"I ordered this for my daughter who is 4 month pregnant. We took it out of the box and she tried it out. She did not like it, said it was not very fluffy and I noticed a lot of the filling keeps coming out if the zipper is a little bit opened. This is not well made, and the worst part is BABY AGE WILL NOT TAKE IT BACK!"
5,A good nights rest!,"I was hesitant to spend so much money on a pillow. Luckily the 5 star reviews outweighed the 1 star reviews and I took a chance on this pillow. I am SO happy I did. This pillow is wonderful. While it is large since it is a horseshoe shape I can switch sides as many times as I want and still have a comfy pillow to rest my arm and leg on. I am 5'4"" so the length of the pillow sides is great for me. I literally had the best nights sleep the first night I used the pillow. It prevents me from rolling onto my stomach (which is very uncomfortable) and from rolling onto my back (which my ob has advised to avoid sleeping on). My ONLY complaint with this pillow is the rough cover. I put a king size pillow cover on both legs of the pillow and tossed a fleece over the top to counteract this problem. If you are not sleeping well I highly recommend purchasing this pillow."
1,Waste of Money!,"This is my fourth pregnancy, and at 19 weeks I was already having trouble sleeping with just a pillow between my legs. I got this to replace my Leachco All Nighter pillow, as after the first three, it had gotten kind of flat. This body pillow is HORRIBLE! It is way too soft, and the cover is very stiff. The first night I slept ok at best, but the second, I woke up in pain in my shoulders, neck, and belly. I don't know if I'm just too early on to need something like this, but there is no way I will sleep with this thing for the rest of my pregnancy. I could sleep with my Leachco at any stage. Please save your money, and your body, and search elsewhere! Try the Leachco body pillow!"
3,It's OK,"I was hoping for significant hip pain relief after reading the other reviews, and while I did have some relief the first night, that unfortunately did not continue. I still use the pillow to provide a ""base"" for the mound of pillows that I'm currently using to prop myself up and to the side (sounds as strange as it looks!). I think I just needed much more cushion and support than this pillow provides on its own. It is pretty long and wide, but the stuffing isn't very thick."
3,don't expect a miracle,"I got this pillow as a gift when I was 26 weeks pregnant. Although very soft (like a feather pillow), I was at first amazed by the results that I got right away. I could finally sleep on the bed without waking up to excruciating hip pain. I am now 31 weeks pregnant and this pillow is not nearly as effective. It's basically better than nothing, but I do wish it was more supportive. The fact that it wraps all the way around your body is the main reason why I put it on my wish list, this feature is useless to me. I barely even feel the pillow behind me and I still wake up on my back in the night. Hip and lower back pain is back with a vengeance, as I have progressed in my pregnancy. This is a non-returnable item so be advised that this pillow is just not supportive enough for the pregnancy woes of the last trimester."
3,DID NOT CURE HIP PAIN UPON WAKING,I purchased a Snoogle from Bed Bath & Beyond during my 1st trimester it was working okay until about my 17 week and I started waking up to pretty bad hip pains. I read the 'most helpful review' for this product and its said something about how it cured the reviewers hip pain. I've had the pillow for about two weeks and Im still waking with the same hip pain. I have a brand new top of the line mattress specifically made for side sleeper so I don't know what else I can do. I liked this pillow for the fact that I don't have to turn it around when I change sides but I also thought this pillow would be bigger and thicker than it was. The woman in the picture must be about 5'0 tall - Im 5'8 and this pillow barely goes past my knee. I am disappointed with this product but its better than the Snoogle I got from Bed Bath & Beyond. Just don't expect it to the cure hip pain!
4,As Good As its going to get,I purchased this pillow for my fiance who is now 16 weeks pregnant. Other than the size of the pillow it has been great. It has helped her relieve back pain that YES she already has. Come to find out its a very large baby. Anyway if your looking for the extra comfort and to release the unpleasant pains I would highly recommend this pillow as my fiance and BABY A would also.
5,Cozy pillow,"I love this pillow , the stuffing , the fabric , your head is pretty much on the mattress , rally cozy"
4,Best pregnancy purchase!,"This pillow has been the best investment I have made for myself during pregnancy. Its really helped me to get more comfortable. Yes, it is huge, but if I didn't have this pillow I would need at least 4 or 5 pillows to help me sleep at night, so it would work out to be the same anyways. Highly recommend to anyone expecting."
5,So great!,Pillow was great while pregnant and is still being used after baby! Makes sleeping very comfortable. My daughter loved it.
3,"Excellent Quality, Sadly Lacked Neck Support","Bought this back in April and then didn't end up needing until recently...very impressed with the quality of the product. The filling is even and soft and the cover is awesome! The zipper is set up in a way where it wont scratch you. I'm only giving it three stars though because the top portion did not give me the head and neck support I needed and woke up with kinks and sore spots. Personally, I did better with a $10 body pillow from Wal-Mart and a cover they provided for another $10 and used my own pillow for sleeping."
5,Handy for lightweight travel,"Really handy to have when packing light for any type of travel. Dries well and dries fast. I'm a minimalist, so I would probably bring this for weekend trips in addition to camping trips."
4,Good towel for traveling,"I bought this towel for an extended trip, and I only had to use it a few times, but was very pleased with it.It does have a very different feel when it is first used, not at all like a towel, but somehow it is able to absorb the water very efficiently. By hanging the towel out, I found that it was usually able to dry very quickly, sometimes in just an hour or so."
4,Another timeless classic!,Well the boy Frank has done it again. Superb collection of political rants. The only reason it got a 4 from me was that its so bloody hard to get in the UK. That said it was worth the wait even if 20 years is a little long. BUY BUY BUYFlipper (UK)
4,A good study guide to go back to from time to time....,"This book gives a valid and ""mostly"" understandable text that describes the aims of Zen. It is a must have for those new to Zen because it expounds upon what Zen is not. It gives the reader a basic vocabulary for future cultivation of Zen philosophy."
5,Hooray for Hip-Hop!,"Wow, great product!, its easy to use, plunty of memory with expantion, and if you know what your doing EASY to transfer files"
1,for easy comparison among MP3 players,"This may not be the most appropriate place for this comment, but I couldn't find a better one. Could the list of technical data for all MP3 players be listed in the same format, to not confuse a shopper ? For example, try to compare this one with its sister of another color, or with the Normad II."
1,RIPOFF!,"A) The product shipped was not a MEDIA SCIENCES product.B) The item delivered was a VERY beat up refurb - one that I would not recommend even if they ADVERTISED as a refurb.C) It was a BLUE cartridge that they refilled with MAGENTA toner!D) When I gave negative feedback they claimed that it was a mistake and said that if I removed the feedback THEN they would send a label for a return! Any good company, at first sign of an error, would resend the correct item with a return label for the mistake.E) I replied to their email request to remove the feedback with a message similar to item D above. Their response - AND I AM QUOTING HERE - ""Our system will automatically send the label once the feedback is removed.""Note: ""send the label"" NOT reship the correct object!!!!!THEY WILL SHIP A RETURN LABEL FOR THEIR ADMITTED MISTAKE WHEN YOU REMOVE THE NEGATIVE FEEDBACK!!!!!DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY - EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,tomagotchis are fun,"Wow these twin gotchi's are so much fun, ohhhh, one just pooped at the mall!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"zoro is an amazing drummer,in my top three......BUT","i agree, the drunken camera man made it hard to learn and nauseating to whatch......but it covers a lot of useful information including a run down r and b history from day 1..... i enjoyed the learning experience and the drumming, but a new camera man is a must!!!!!!!"
2,Thick and large seam,"This may be a good liner for cold weather, but is not good for the other three seasons. The sock is too thick, and the raised toe seam may cause blisters even if worn inside out."
4,Summer hiking sock and liner for the other three seasons.,"This sock is a bit heavy. I wouldn't use it to run or bike in during the summer, but I do like it for hiking. Typically I wear one pair inside out as a liner against the skin and then a second pair right-side-out over that in the summer. In the colder weather I wear one liner inside out and a wool sock of appropriate thickness over the liner (this is all very duh, I know.)This set-up works great for all day hiking. I have been on the trail when the temp hit 106 degrees and my feet were not at all too hot and they were not sweaty, either. The sweat was wicked away and my feet were kept cool. In hot or cold, this sock works great.I've never had an issue with seams, but I always wear the sock layer against my skin inside out unless they are totally seamless and I've never had an issue with any sock's seam.Overall, these are a great sock for certain use and if you don't like sock seams you can try wearing your socks inside out...because it works."
2,too long,"These are lightweight, mid-calf and just enough warmth to wear under everyday socks, BUT theyare too long. I wear a women't size 8 and ordered the correct size, but alas the heel of the sockis at my ankle."
3,Very good liner so far,Comfortable and does the job. The care instructions are not going to happen. Cold wash gentle I can do but air dry no machine drying allowed--no way! This time of the year I go on a lot of short hikes and go through a lot of liners. On long hikes I only take a couple 3 pair so yes they get washed in a stream and air died; but not at home when I can have 5 or even 10 pair to dry. Hope they hold up under machine air fluff.
3,Now that we are in 2001,"I first read the book in 1993. Now that we have made it through the Y2K disaster, I dedided to read the book again. I notice that the world did not come to an end in 2000, Jupiter did not blow up because of a bomb we 'secretly' placed on an exploration rocket, the world population crisis seems to have passed, etc. While the book is interesting, some of the points and/or conclusions Cooper makes seem to be stretching it a bit, some of the book appears to be just plain fiction. Still a good book that would lead one to read other books on the same subject matter."
3,Interesting read! But don't rely on Google to discount this author!,"I just want to say that this book allows you to draw your OWN conclusions from information a man was able to provide and because of that..i find this book interesting and a good read. As for his death, all deaths that look suspicious are NEVER suspicious. As for going on Google to find out about the ""real"" Cooper; let it be said that you need to do alot more research on someone than going to Google to take something as FACT! Google is NOT the most reliable source, it is simply what it is; A SOURCE OF INFORMATION. The book is worth the read. Especially the part of the book that speaks about FEMA; any one heard of LA riots, Katrina? He speaks on FEMA's role very candidly and we can use both these instances as to how true he was in this area of his book. But don't base your knowledge or interest on any of our reviews...read the book for yourself and make your own conclusion of an interesting read, ENJOY!"
3,Behold the Pale Horse - audiobook,"After reading the softcover several years ago and being very intrigued as the events forecasted in the book came to pass, I decided to purchase the audiobook. Although I was reminded of many points that I had forgotten and understood better what I previously did not understand (as I was quite a bit younger the first time around), I would rather have the actual book copy, as it includes much more written information and an an extensive Appendix including photocopies of alleged actual documentation and interesting newspaper clippings.This might be considered a little to Right-wing or too Conspiracy theory for some, but it sure is an interesting read to make you contemplate, if nothing more."
1,Bill Cooper Was Clinically Insane.,"He should have been institutionalized for his own safety and the safety of others. He made numerous threats against respected academic researchers and heavily exagerated claims of his own first hand knowledge on these matters, especially regarding Majestic 12. He was also connected to the extreme right-wing, anti-tax movement, though he was not an official member of any militia. Not only did most abduction researchers shun anything he said, but even former associate Bob Lazar (the discredited Area 51/S-4 guy) distanced himself from Cooper. The man became increasingly unstable and by the end was wanted by the U.S. Marshalls on felony charges. On 11/5/2001, police attempted to serve an unrelated warrant against him for assault and endangerment. He opened fire and shot one of them in the head. The remaining deputies returned fire and killed Cooper."
1,Garbage,This book is nothing but random declassified government documents. Super boring read....All of the information in this book is old and out of date.All the information contained in this book can be found in any number of conspiracy videos on youtube.
1,Waste of money,Most of the things I read in here was just the author defending himself against accusations and letters that he received; also he advertises other people's books.
2,It was Ok,I read this book because it was mentioned in the Mommaboy novel. But to be honest Pale Horse wasn't what I expected. I guess I'm more of a novel type girl. I'm defintly not a believer in UFO's type of girl.
3,An Introduction,"Behold A Pale Horse is OK as an introduction to the subject matter of mass governmental conspiracies taken with a grain of salt. For anyone who is more experienced with the subject matter, I do NOT recommend the book - unless you merely want to become familiar with yet another exploration of theories you are probably already aware of.There are better books on this subject - mostly focusing on more narrow aspects of it. To name a few: Stevenson or Robinson on Freemasonry; Baigent/Lincoln/Leigh:Dan Browne -""The Da Vinci Code""; ""Holy Blood/Grail""; John Coleman books; Springmeier: ""Blood Lines of the Illuminati."""
3,"I found some good information, some uninteresting; but, persevere, its worth it.","The ruling Elite controlls the information fed to the general population. Creating and/or maintaining ignorance is their ultimate goal. I think most would agree. There were a couple of things I questioned, though.."
3,"Poor Mr Cooper, EVERYONE'S NOT OUT TO GET YOU , BUDDIE!","After I read it I was shocked that maybe some of it was true, but I also realized that much of it was just Cooper's ""conpsiracy theory"" rantings about a lot of government mumbo jumbo. Relax Mr. Cooper, everyone isn't out to get you with a hidden agenda! I'm not Catholic, but all the propaganda and rantings about them are getting kind of old, don't you think?? And what about all those sketchy documents in the back of the book, where did you dig those up? Sorry, but other that being very entertaining, the book was full of guesses and full of errors!"
2,A farse. Numerous factual errors cloud the arguments.,"While there may be some semblence of truth behind some of the arguments in this book, the paranoid fantasies of William Cooper are worth reading only for humor. Take for example page 221, where he proclaims that plant life grows on the Moon, and the Moon ""does not, as claimed, always present the exact same side to the Earth"", which is utterly ridiculous. Obvious errors such as this cloud his already rough grouping of numerous conspiracy theories, and do not lend credibility to his already deluded arguments"
2,"Very Weird and Seriously Schizoid, but Somewhat Amusing.","Apparently, Mr. Cooper thought that Space Men were in charge of the good old USA from the 1950's to the time this book was written. Give him credit for putting to paper some very weird, even entertaining ideas, about the conspiracies which various lunatic fringes seem to ingest with relish, but the Spaceman one is , well, form your own opinion. The author may be what is charitably called a ""deranged genius"" , though much more deranged than genius. Amazing that so many swallow this stuff like a new malt brew at the local tavern/brewery!..Real Comic book weirdness here disguised as history."
1,I started to give this book some crediblility and then.....,"I got to the part about him being a NEC 9545 (as he says, ""internal security specialist"") at Sugar Grove, WV Navy Base. Guess what? I was a 9545 (military police, btw) stationed at Sugar Grove from Feb. 2000 through Sept. 2002. BULL $***!!!! I just started laughing and threw it away right there. Didnt even finish reading it. I know what goes on there, and it is NOT UFO stuff, etc. This guy came about as close to military ""intelligence"" as I have to....East Guam. (never been there!) Instant discredit. Anyone who believes this is an idiot. His ""predictions"" could have been ""read"" by anyone who kept up with global current affairs. Total Bull-honkey."
5,Awesome,"Received in a timely manner, and the book was in good shape. Plus the contents of the book are awesome!"
1,This is a book?,"I would give it less than 1 star but that is not possible. Would love to get my money back on this scam of a book...Although, I will say I was surprised to find many of the plots for the TV series The X-Files in this book which came out a couple of years before the X-Files. Did the writers of the X-Files give this guy credit for their plots? I'll have to check and see, because many of the plots came just about word for word out of this book."
2,SORRY I BOUGHT IT,I could not wait to read this book as i had heard so much about it.I have to say i was disappointed to say the least.I gave up a quarter of the way through.
1,Something to read while cleaning your sandwich board.,"There are concentrations of money and influence in the world. That's just obvious and status quo (and those of us without either are all free to hate it). How that power is distributed and the specific dynamics at work in maintaining and wielding it are worth exploring. Read Chomsky, Hobbes, Goldman, Marx, Foucault: anything that stabs at a sober analysis, whatever its political bent (it can be better to expose yourself to ideas you don't agree with than to simply hear what affirms your views).I encourage you to find this book at a new age bookstore and confirm or disprove what I think, which is that the writing herein is totally self-evident to be a description of a paranoid delusion. Biblical concepts, secret societies, texts commonly viewed as frauds, and wildly unsupported and bizarre claims are cobbled together into a world view so sinister and disjointed that it would drive anyone over the edge."
5,present,This was a present that I sent to my brother. He told me that he had really enjoyed the book.
4,Good read but very unorganized,"I liked this book and it was an interesting read, what really got me is how unorganized is and how much the author drifts away from one point to another."
4,good book,"Good book, a little far out. weather to beleave it or not. I hope not. things the government hide, wow"
5,Behold the Pale Horse,"These red hot documented facts are the kind we need in America. William Cooper is a live wire!!! He reminds me of the prophet Micaiah. Yes let the prophetic roll on! Bse I'm equally called into the office of the prophet, I'll conduct a fast as the Spirit leads me for God to preserve yo life that many warriors of truth may be encouraged to step up their prophetic spirits in the LORD!!!"
4,A must read if you like this kind of stuff,"I have read other books but none of them were as fascinating as this. Some parts were really shocking, some were kind of farfetched. In any case its a book worth reading, though i have to say that you have to have a pretty open mind for it. It was worth the money spent on it, it opens your eyes to things you did not even think that goes on. Even if only a fraction of it is true it gives you plenty to think about."
5,The world as we think it is IS NOT .!!!!!!,"I have NEVER read a book that made me question Everything about how things work in society and the world. Although Mr. Cooper Prefaces this book by saying that he's not sure about all the minute deatils ..the basic outline of a global conspiracy is spelled out with frightening accuracy. Hi extensive military background as well as his allegiances are all spelled out and there for all to see, he isn't here to do the talk show circuit, this book is a call to arms. Do yourself and the world a favor and read this book, It will change your views on everything from Aliens to JFK to the seemingly harmless Masons..."
4,Cooper's secret message,"This book mixes absurdity with some reality, therefore discrediting the reality, the same tactic Cooper accuses others of doing. If you read closely though, Cooper is doing this on purpose in order to appear harmless to those monitoring him. It was the only way that he would be allowed to say some of the real things that were and are happening. On later writings, he recants much of the silliness about aliens. When he states the nonsense about 1+3+3 = 7, he really wants you to read page 133 of HIS book, which talks about FEMA, the core threat to America's future, in his view. Notice how this page is also the 7th page of the FEMA part. (7 listed near page bottom.) The FEMA threat that he warned about is now a reality, in the form of the Emergency Powers Act, instituted after 911."
5,An enlightening experience for those who seek the truth,"I found the book to be superb! Cooper had access to documents forbidden to the public. He is a diciplined writer, who tells you deliberatly to ""not""believe him, and check the information out for yourself. Maybe there's more to X-Files than we beleive."
4,commendable,"This is a very informative book, well written, engaging, and in some parts down-right scary. William Cooper is someone that I admired because he wasn't afraid to speak out, or die for what he believed in. There are a plethora of conspiracy writers and most of them are so far out there that they cannot be taken seriously, and most of them wouldn't take a bullet. I believe that Mr. Cooper was sincere in his research and presentation of what he wrote in this book, and what he spoke about in public meetings, with a desire to educate, not entertain. For example the chapter about FEMA was something to really think about. The book is a good read, and a tool to educate those who want to know."
1,Idiocy,"This book, apparently, is where people are getting the fake John Paul II quote, ""Don't go to God for forgiveness of sins, come to me,"" which is being spread all over the internet. It is a lie. I have a copy of the Los Angeles Times article that the idiot author Milton William Cooper says gives this quote. It does not give that quote. Cooper further states that, ""the pope is telling us HE IS God!""Anyone, who can't take the time to check a ""supposed"" quote from a newspaper before printing it in book form frankly shouldn't be writing anything. Unless, of course, he deliberately made up the quote and afixed an article he figured no one would bother checking to it.So please stop using this phony quote to try and ""prove"" that the pope is the anti-Christ or that the Catholic Church is a false church. The quote is FAKE! No pope, ever, made such a claim."
1,Spiraling into paranoiac fantasy...,"Delusional ""everybody's out to get me"" line common to all paranoia. If you roll your car, does that prove agents were trying to kill you? Do government goons run you off the road three times... in a limo? Really? A limo? Do they then leave you alive to die on your own rather than finish the job? This doesn't make sense. Pure schizophrenia. If you love fantasy, this is for you."
1,Not a Fan,"While this book has many very interesting documents and odd inclusions, it is very badly organized and very confusing."
1,Sad look into mental illness.....,Paranoia and conspiracy theories are always advanced signs of mental illness. The author was obviously riddled with it when he wrote this book. His mental status apparently continued until he was killed by apprehending officers years later. The publisher of this book should have recognized this illness and asked the author to seek help rather than enabling him.
4,Good Reading,"I enjoyed reading the book, in the begining the book showed some promise, then later on it got a little ridiculous. Most of the things he predicted have not come to pass.. some of which he gave specific dates. some chapters open your mind, other just want to make you laugh..."
3,Behold a pale horse horse,the book was too worn. the pages were coming loose. i will have to do some work on it to keep it together.
5,A must read for truth seekers!!!!!,A must read for truth seekers!!!!! This is a very long book but has tons of great info for whats really going on in our world and beyond.
5,Behold a Pale Horse is a monumental book,"I have this book hardcopy, it is so old I wanted to make sure I had the digital copy also. ""Everyone"" should read this book at least once!"
2,bad writing,I just couldn't get through this book! I'm sure the information is there but it's locked out by very poor writing skills.
2,"Too much chaff, not enough wheat","This is the kind of book that gives historical revisionists and truthseekers a bad name--specifically the ""conspiracy nut"" slur. While the author may or may not be sincere, a look at the cover is enough to give you a sense of how serious or not serious a presentation is contained within. Certainly there is much about history and society that we are routinely lied to about and historical facts that are suppressed so as to protect those with the power to pull the invisible strings fettering the world. This book documents much of that, but unfortunately delves into much disinformation and in the end will leave people confused--perhaps aware of several legitimate issues they had not known about before but also distracted by a series of unfounded claims muddying the waters. I put this in the same category as the works of David Icke, of reptilian shape-shifter fame..."
5,The end all of all the governmental lies!,Cooper is dead on. He knows what he is talking about. Behold Thanksgiving this year!!!! BEWARE!!! Cooper warns us and tries to tell us but many still don't believe..if what he says in this book isn't true then why does the gov. secretly keep trying to kill him? This book is awesome!!
3,Behold A Pail Of Horse... What?,"I have to say this book is a most interesting read. William Cooper could be considered a conspiracy theorist's theorist. It won't be long before you realize that everything is connected to a ""Secret Order"" of the highest echelon of power. Cooper goes into to everything from Aliens to Zion and lays out a connection to all major events in history. The only thing that doesn't make an appearance in this book is Elvis. Cooper's story is over the top to which I don't know that I have ever read anything else this fantastic, as in out there.I think that Mr. Cooper had a genuine fear for his life in having this published. He goes into a lot heavy stuff about some very powerful groups and individuals that would have you dead if you knew the truth about them. Pale Horse is a conspiracy's conspiracy book that touches on the biggest ""Cabal"" in history.You may find some, all, or none of Behold A Pale Horse believable, but read the book and see for yourself."
5,Very Interesting Reading,"This is a very interesting book to say the least. It is not fast reading, as the author talks about things that most of us have little idea about. I can't say that I believe everything in the book, but it all gives me something to think about and do more research on. There are some very disturbing statements in this book, that if true, means we are all in a big bunch of trouble.I think it's a must read for everyone who is not content to let someone else tell you what is important."
5,Required for anyone who wants the truth about government!,"I first read this in 1992 and did not believe a word that was written. I was, at the time, a very bleeding heart liberal! This couldn't be right, hrmph!, that would mean - gasp! - the Government entities weren't telling me the truth! Needless to say, I and my, then newlywed, wife researched what we could...to find that it was exactly as Mr. Cooper had described it. There are some very controversial facts described herein that I was not able to verify. However, I did verify approxiametly 80 to 85% of his documentation and found it to be right on. For those that discredit this book...grow your own brain! Do your own research instead of eating the re-digested junk the mainstream media feeds you! I can only hope he cares enough to write another..."
5,Paul Revere's midnight ride,"The late William Cooper can be likened to Paul Revere in his ride to warn the patriots of his time. Even though his book was put together almost haphazardly, his reasoning was to get as much information together as possible and let the readers sort things out and research further on their own."
2,Am I nuts or did I really read that....,"I've only gotten as far as page 76, but someone please help me out with Cooper's reasoning. He states that Adam Weishaput, the founder of the Illuminati, wrote ""the book that provided the ideological foundation for capitalism and for the Industrial Revolution,"" The Wealth of Nations. Excuse me please, but didn't Adam Smith, not Adam Weishaput write Wealth of Nations? Indeed he(Adam Smith)did! Was that a typo error or did/does Cooper know something about Smith/Weishaput historians do not? Can someone help me out with this?"
1,Are You People Nuts??? This book stinks !,"I can't believe the good reviews you people are giving this driveling nonsensical book! This book is poorly written, rambling and totally paranoid! This is, without a doubt, the worst book I've EVER read! The only reason I gave it 1 star is because that was as low as I could go! This book has NO GOOD POINTS! Could I be clearer? It is garbage!!! Save your money. You have been warned! (I can't believe they put this book on tape. What were they thinking?)"
1,Memoirs of a very paranoid man,"When I first picked up this book it was merely out of curiousity. It was very entertaining. But nobody should read this and take everything in it as the gospel truth. Cooper seems like a very paranoid person. Like I said, it is very entertaining and very interesting. But many of the things within the book was down right laughable. Esp all the moon colony and alien treaty stuff.The only book I believe in 100% is the Bible. This book only looks to create fear and paranoia. Stay away from it if you are the type of person who is easily convinced about things. Because Cooper is a very convincing writer. But nothing he says in the book has any merit or evidence to support it."
4,Dose of Reality,"I found the book very revealing. Input from media sources are skewed by their agenda to shape our perception of reality. Cooper reveals information withheld by government and the complicit media that allows one to get a better picture of what our world is really like. I know there is a lot that goes on in this country that is hidden from the public. The author brings some of it to light, although a lot of the information is dated. I wonder what has been withheld since this book has been written."
3,Behold a Pale Horse,"william Cooper was Brilliant, albeit unusual man. With his experiences with the government, he tells a pretty scary story of what our goverment is capable of. He even predicted 9/11 before it happened. An excellent read for folks that have question or concerns regarding the past and future of America. John Crippen, writerThe Sweet Smell of ASH in the Morning: A Twisted Look at Forensic Mental Health in Atascadero State Hospital By A Burnt-out PsychTech"
4,I hope this is fiction;we're in big trouble if this is true,A friend of mine turned me on to this book and I could not believe what I was reading. the biggest problem I had with this book was the fact that it all makes sence in a very scary way. I think that every american should read this book and make their own decision and write their congress man and have these allogations investigated.
3,Makes for lively discussion at the breakfast nook.,"Much of what Mr. Cooper claims to have seen in government memorandums and various intellegence data is simply impossible to varify. Much if not all of it can be refuted as a lot of bits and pieces which have been taken out of context to outright forgery--- and since there is no index, it takes a long time to work within its disorganized framework. It does, however, seem to be full of things that have since been coming true, and may be the original source of many of the current trends in UFO legend--- the Greys and their alleged treaty with the US during Eisenhower's term as president, for instance. Anyway, like I say, very highly recommended as fodder for fantastic conversation."
3,Not as bad as I expected.......,Picked up this book after a recommendation on a forum. Turned out to be about what I expected. Some info was so-so and some pretty interesting. It's not a blockbuster but I recommend it if you get around to it.
2,Not very believable or rational.,"Don't get me wrong, I don't trust the government particularlyand I'm perfectly willing to believe that the government isdoing all sorts of stuff to us without our knowledge.But it's really hard to believe a lot of this mishmosh.There are some nuggets of possible information here, a lotof contradictory paranoia and many things that are justplain wrong.I could argue with specific points, but generally the ideathat the US government, not a particularly subtle or smartorganization, could keep profound secrets, known tothousands of people, for three generations and over a dozenchanges of administration, is just not believable to me.There are tons of good books on these subjects.I'd start with ""Everything You Know Is Wrong""(Robert Anton Wilson) which has a great bibliography,and then go from there."
4,Let there be light!,"These lightbulbs do a nice job over our vanity. They provide a soft light. I have only have them for a few months now so I can't comment much on how long they last, but for the price they are just fine. Amazon did a nice job packing the product - no cracked bulbs. I will order these again when I need more."
3,"Breath Of Fresh Air, But Still Not There","For a true diehard MMA (i.e, UFC, Pride, etc.) fan, this was something long overdue. The graphics are great. The fighter creation program is wonderful. And the game is terribly realistic. However, once one has mastered the basic fighting moves, there is not much else. Often times, your fighter will not perform basic functions on command. Also, I still have yet (after months of playing this game) to figure out how to perform complex manuevors. Most disappointing is the fact that UFC legends such as Ken Shamrock, R. Gracie, Dan Severn, Tank Abbott, Olag Takatarov, and Don Frye are not part of the game. Furthermore, while this is a must for any true MMA enthusiast, there are many things that can be improved on."
3,ahh ok game,"I played this game on a diffrent system and thought it was ok, but if you don't like that type of fighting, than this game is not for you. it is slowerpace than street fighter and it gets very technical at times. I personally didn't think very much of it but thought it had its redeaming qualities, like it had some good character selections, and you could play diffrent type fighters against each other. I.E sumo wrestler vs. tae kwan doe master. Overall its an ok game but if you don't like slow pace games i wouldn't reccommend this to you."
4,Yo - don't listen to the others - this games got talent!!!!,If ure reading all the other reviews (if they're bad) don't listen!! It's a very good game. The graphics are easily as good as Smackdown 1 or 2(i have them both) and it requires more skill than just kicking the crap out of someone with chairs etc.. Althouigh if u like doing that you can make the oppponent bleed when you hit them enough - hahahaha smackdown don't have that!!!!Its also got quite a few modes and the create a character is a good alternative. It takes time to master which is good because after all it would be boring if it were too easy (erm...muttering under my breath SMACKDOWN!!!!)If you are looking for a more technical game that requires patience and talent (and blood) go for this.......but if you are crap at REAL fighting games (erm.... like smackdown) you woundn't have the skill to play this.Buy it and see for yourself....
3,What this is and is not,"""Aradia: Gospel of the Witches"" is an invaluable book to help create an understanding of the history of modern witchcraft and Wicca. What it is not is a Gospel of the Witches. Most scholars agree that this was not used by an Italian Witch cult practicing in the late 19th century, but was in fact a complete fabrication, either Leland was deceived by a charlatan or created the document himself to advance his theories. The book's only value is in how it influenced the later Wiccan movement."
2,Aradia: Gospel of the Witches,"I am a little disappointed with this book. Thought it would be more about Aradia and it is not. Still a decent read, but misleading with the title."
4,Use this work with good caution.,"Leland's Aradia is not recommended for newcomers. It contains information on various rites that are conducted in the nude, and also mentions the name Lucifer which can be very easily confused with another character by that same name used by monotheists. Quoting from p. 104 in the appendix, ""Prominent in this, and naturally enough, was the worship of Diana the protectress - for the alleged adoration of Satan was a far later invention of the Church, and it has never really found a leading place in Italian witchcraft to this day.""This book is often referred to as the pretext for Leland's Etruscan Roman Remains which is said to be a followup to this work. Use this work with caution, and be mindful of the threefold law if you attempt to use any of the incantations; namely the ones outlined in chapters 4 & 5. This book is not recomended for children."
4,Interesting,"The Gospel of witches is something to truly read. However, its complex understandings and its lack of the image of Aradia failed through out the book. Eventhough, there were the rituals that were very interesting, because, you can see how the Charge of the Goddess was formed..that was really interesting to see. Anyhow, this book was very good, please remember that the book does drag and has more ""ritual sense"" than what the book was suppose to do...to tell you what Aradia was."
3,A book of some value,"This book was written with good intent. The author suceeds in showing that Aradia is the avatar to some witches (not all might i add). It is a good refrence book. But to me it sounded like a highly christianized version of witchcraft. Because it orders the gods, and you do not do that. It is an interesting work to read though."
5,Good Book,Aradia: Gospel of the Witches (Purchased on 08/15/2008)by Charles LelandI received this book in a very timely manner and it is a great addition to my collection.Thanks
2,Confusing mixture,"Although this is clearly a forerunner of modern Wiccan tradition, it hardly deserves to be. The proto-""Charge"" is poetic, and here and there an idea warrants exploration, but in the main this is highly negative and most Wiccans who believe in the 3-fold law should avoid it. It promotes killing all ""masters"" (rich people), poisoning, and generally getting your way at the expense of others. Finally, and most ironic to me, is the fact that its ""spells"" have the *nerve* to actually THREATEN the Goddess Diana if she doesn't help you with your spells! Highly questionable stuff here. Great historical data, but not a tradition I would want to be associated with, even though I have Italian ancestry."
4,Important piece of witchcraft history...,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It's not very long, and it's decieivingly simple the first time you read it. But when you read it again, it becomes more and more clear how much modern Wicca is influenced by this work. I'm really surprised how few people have reviewed this book, I truly hope it's not an indicator of how many have actually read it. It's not a 101 book, or even really Wiccan book, but I think that it's essential reading for every Wiccan today, if not pagan."
1,Editing,"I was aware from a previous rating that the book had some editing problems, but this book has a ridiculous amount of editing problems. Commas are out of place, words are misspelled, words are left out, and when the curse words were misspelled, I knew I couldn't handle this book anymore. Is the plot good? Yes. Is the story well-written? I can't tell you because as a copyeditor, the 100+ mistakes I counted trying to read the book totally distracted me. I would love to reread this book after it's been edited but as of now, I can't handle it."
1,God Help Those........,"I honestly feel this was the worst written book I have ever read. I am an avid reader, I could not keep up with the story line, it was absolutely awful. I was so tired of the book, honestly, I skipped several pages as I pushed myself to get to the end of the book, I could not take anymore; I just wanted the read to be over, simply awfully written; the author needs to fire his editor (too many misspelled words and words used in the wrong context)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Horrible,"I really did not enjoy this book at all. It was all over the place. The ending sucked and I would love to ask the author, what was the point of this story. It covers their drug use, his choice to get help but he keeps backsliding and the author never circles back to him getting help. The book starts off with him growing at the law firm and then it just goes to the street. I thought this would be a christian fiction book and it was the total opposite. This author needs to refocus and and decide if this is the right career for him."
1,Tis certainly is not a book...It can't be.,"I found buying the $1 on here sometimes are a good deal. this book is crazy!! I'm only in chapter two and I cannot believe what I'm reading. They spelling errors are ridic!!! I probably won't be able to finish as I feel like I'm in 3rd grade reading a fellow classmates diary of their life. This book is awful. I should have known when the character said ""waist"" instead of ""waste of time"". Jesus be a dictionary reference to this authors soul..."
4,Realistic!,This book was an attention grabber from the first page. The characters were realistic and visual. I enjoyed it a lot!
2,good plot.. but needs a spell check,"This book kept my attention and the plot was ok..could've been better.. middle to end, it started to drag and that's when the run-on sentences and misspellings began. Not just a few, but a lot a misspellings.. it turned me off and couldn't finish reading it. I thought books were reviewed before being published..guess not"
4,It touched me!,"While the book had it's share of typos, it was a good book! The story was believable - I thought- I really felt for the characters and I loved how the seriousness of what Marcus was experiencing was portrayed. I like how the fact that the author did express how quickly a serious addiction could begin. I hope there will be a part two!!!"
1,100% Misleading for Christians,"I purchased this book in an effort to get a good CHRISTIAN fiction read. I did read the whole book in an effort to locate the CHRISTIAN turning point. It never came. I was highly disappointed in the author. He chose a very misleading title that only appeared as the ending phrase of the entire book. Church and God only came up in the whole book for about three paragraphs to prepare for a shotgun wedding in which the author added curse words to that. I was disappointed in all the lewd sexual content. I understand that reading should be diverse...but pick an appropriate title for the content of what we will be reading. This book needed a warning or censorship for the christian mind as well as the grammatical drama. I am not so saved that I am no earthly good however, I do watch what is said and the context that God's name is drawn into."
2,GOD HELPS THOSE,"THIS BOOK WAS A SLOW READ, I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO FINISH READING THIS BOOK. I DO NOT RECOMMEDND THIS BOOK, UNLESS YOU CAN'T FIND ANYTHING ELSE TO READ."
4,God Helps Those,I enjoyed this book from the beginning to the end. Wish there would have been more at the end. Plan to look for more books like this to read.
1,God help those....,This book was poorly written and alot of misspelled words was in the book...it just was not what I expected...I didn't even continue with the reading.
1,Zzzzzzzzzz boring!,"I purchased this book due to a great cover read little of it but its $1 what I got to loose I thought. Well the errors are unbelievable, editor needs to go back to grammar school. Was not entertained with the story line, too fake. I couldnt continue reading it.Sad thing is that I purchased for my kindle in the office, for the ride home I ended up sleeping!"
3,Error,This was sent in error - I had ordered the story on cassette....so as a result it is ok because I have it but have not read it.....
4,Great addition to any camera bag,"My only complaint to this otherwise excellent product is the erratic behavior when the batteries start to go bad. I've never actually seen the low battery indicator, what I've noticed is the ready light never turns on, and you hear that high-pitched charging whine. When you use the camera, sometimes the flash fires, sometimes it doesn't. That's the only way I know I need to change the batteries."
5,Nice upgrade from the onboard flash,"I'm very happy with my SB-600 on myNikon D40x. Having the ability to bounce the flash off of the ceiling or a reflector has really improved the quality of my photos. I'm not currently using this flash as a slave, but I bought this one rather than the SB-400 because of that ability.You should know that the weight of this flash, plus the 4 AA's that it requires does throw off the balance of your camera a bit, and the added weight takes a little getting used to."
5,It's amazing,"This is the first external flash I use, so this is not a professional review, but it works great for me. I have a D40 and I'm able to set as continuous shooting and the flash fires in every single shoot. The flash head cover all angles to bounce the light (SB-400 does not). This is the main reason I choose SB-600 instead of SB-400.The only drawback I noticed is the weight. It weights 2 pounds that is half the weight of the D40.Another important warning is about the wireless control. Neither the D40 neither the SB-600 are able to operate as wireless Commander, though SB-600 can act as a slave. With other cameras, like SB-80, it's not a problem, but if you intent to use remote units with the D40, you should buy the SB-800 or SB-900."
4,Great value with a great function!,"I use this flash for my Nikon D300, it is a good flash with all kind of functions that I need.I been use it when I shot some wedding pictures and for most indoor use with my 24-70mm lens. Compare to the SB-800 speedlight, the price of the SB-600 speedlight is more than great and the function is enough. It is just like you buy a 50mm f1.8 when you want to buy the 50mm f1.4 lens."
5,an alternative to the sb-400,"if you want a stronger flash than the sb-400 without breaking the bank, this is it. get it soon, as nikon will be replacing it with the newer sb-700 which will cost more."
5,Great Flash,"This flash improves the pictures I take by a noticable amount. Once you learn how to control the flash and bounce it of different surfaces, you will never want to go back to the built in flash."
5,Great performance and a tight body,"Versatile and very effecient speedlight. Tested it at night, during the day for fill. Great digital pic. Fast recovery."
5,great strobe,this is a great addition to any nikon dslr. the only thing better in portability is having more + a sb-800. get creative and use them off camera as well. i highly recommend have this flash as an addition to your gear.
4,SB-600 Review,"this is a great flash that you can use wirelessly if your camera supports it (most nikons now a days can do it). I only have one complaint, and that is that the flash head can only be moved up and down, and not left and right. this is only a problem when i want to bounce the flash off of the ceiling and shoot in landscape. when i do this i have to take the flash off and either use a cord or go wireless and hold it in my hand or set it up with the included stand on the ground.Other than that, the flash is really great. i would buy it again if i needed to."
5,"Awesome, awesome, awesome","This is the first flash unit Ive purchased in about five or six years and I couldn't have had more fun with it. Mostly because its the most advanced flash Ive ever owed, but its simple enough not to overwhelm a newbie. I dont really know enough about flash photography to write a really good review but I do love this flash."
4,Fantastic flash,I was using a SB-400 flash before I got the SB-600. The CLS capabilities are truly amazing and easy to use. I also got one of the Nikon DVDs on CLS that helped understand how to best use it.
1,poor service,I used the SB600 two times and was only able to use it for 15-20 pictures per set of batteries. The third time I used the flash it would not even turn on. After examining it close there was corrosion on the battery terminals even though my batteries have always been brand new. I have feeling that I may have been sent a used flash that someone else maybe returned since it was messed up even though I ordered a new one. So I guess this could be more of a customer service complaint than anything (since they wont do anything about it but said they could give me refund of 50% - 80% on what I paid. All I know is that the flash is only 2 months old and it doesnt work. So a ONE star is even being generous.Poor customer service for a defective piece of equipment. Probably wont order through amazon again for anything important.
5,Nikon SB-600 Speedlight Flash order,Flash received fairly promptly for the low choice of shipping timing - interesting to see that it arrived in my city in 1 day but waited 5 days for local delivery to ensure that people do not expect faster delivery for the lower prices!!No problems on Amazon's side - handled well.
4,Nikon SB-600 Review,This flash was exactly what I was looking for. I needed better dinstance lighting for night time shooting as well as more natural lighting when shooting indoors. This flash fits the bill perfectly. highly recommended.
1,Do not Buy!!! Poor Quality & Poor Nikon Service,This Flash unit has let me down many times when I needed it to work. I have had it service twice under warranty by Nikon and it has stop working again. I may have just a bad unit or the design this unit is of very low quality. If you buy this model you can be the judge but make sure to test often so that you are not stuck with it.
2,"Great flash, poor reliability",I have used an SB-600 for 3-4 years with an older D50 body. The flash performance and versatility have been great until the unit started experiencing issues with the LCD display flashing on and off and the auto-zoom no longer functioning. Not the reliability I have come to expect since using Nikon products for nearly 30 years. Seems same issue exists for other owners.
5,Perfect,"There is not much to say about this unit, except that it works... I have two of them.. Both serve me well.. No complaints.. I do hear that they are no longer being made.. I think the SB-700 is the replacement.. And, if I needed a new one, I would learn how to use the 700, but when I looked at one, it looked too complicated for what I do.. So, for now, this is my favorite.. If you can find one, I think you too will love it... I use Eneloop rechargable batteries in my units, and I can shoot until I am worn out, but the batteries are not.. I have yet to wear a set down in a day, and I am talking 300-500 photos... Great flash, and great batteries. Super combo."
3,Not bad but definitely overpriced,"This product is well intergrated into the Nikon camera system and works very well as an integrated part of the Nikon flash system. In addition, the unit is powerful (with good range) and covers a very wide angle well. In addition, the unit charges quickly and does take quite a while to become too hot to require cooling down.Unfortunately the product also has some drawbacks. One is that the build quality leaves much to be desired. It seems only mediocre and not very well. Most generic flashes that are much cheaper than this, in only the $150 range, are better built. In addition, shooting in manual mode is very difficult. A few features could easily have been added to overcome this problem (i.e., a button and an LCD feature built into the current LCD screen that shows ISO and range charts, etc.). Considering this unit's cost (i.e., a lot), one can easily do better by purchasing a generic make that is only half the price."
3,"Good for everyday use, but not for heavy users.","The sb-600 is a good inexpensive flash for an everyday use. The only problem I had was when I used it for work. Working on a cruise ship doing photography, we take up to 800 photos in less than 4 hours. I found that the 600 cannot keep up with the rapid shooting that we do here. I have used the 700 and 800 and they seem to work with the high production."
4,Awesome Flash!!!!,"I got this for my D80 DSLR. Who Knew? I expected to get better performance than my pop-up but not as much as I had from my friend's SB800 (borrowed for a weekend)... Boy was I wrong, this flash will be my workhorse from now on. I fully expect to buy more. Better battery performance than the SB800, just about as many shots and is you don't the the extra power for distance shots then just as good as the SB800. Now if Nikon would only make us an SB600 ""s"" and add us a switch to make getting in and out of the CLS system easier (like on the SB900), then I would be giving that unit 10 stars...."
3,"Good performance, but disappointed by quality and customer service","I've been happy with the SB-600's performance for the year that I've had it and agree with reviewers who praise it in that respect. However, just after the expiration of the one-year warranty, the rubber cover over the button that releases the head angle adjustment started falling off. I've babied this flash, so it appears to be a faulty adhesive. And Nikon won't fix it because they consider it to be a ""cosmetic defect."" Now dust and dirt can get into the head angle adjustment mechanism. Disappointing that this company doesn't do more to stand behind its products."
5,Good flash,I purchased this flash mainly to take picture of my new born child. Due to having a older D50 I am unable to use all of the functions that come included with the flash. But the flash seems to be sturdy and allows me to take wonderfully lit pictures. It is worth the money to purchase one instead of just using the built in flash which comes with the camera.
5,Nikon SB 600 Speedlight Flash,"I bought this flash for my daughter's Nikon D-60, and she loves it. Easy to use, excellent product, best price in the market. Local electronic stores sell this flash for $50 or $80 more, plus tax. If I buy another Nikon camera, and will buy another SB600 flash."
5,Good Deal for Consumer,"Very good value for your money. If you are professional photographer, you would have bought the SB800 and skipped any reviews. If you are consumer, this is the best value for your money. I have this flash for two years and took thousand of pictures. Powerful enough for taking pictures from graduation to Taekwondo competitions as well as any other school events. I am just adding to the choir. Good luck!"
5,Cheaper at Best Buy,"I really like this camera!! I bought it at Best Buy for $219 plus tax. It's just as good as the SB-900 for why I use this camera, and it costs more than $200 less."
4,Flash,I like it for the cash. I think I would make sure to get the batteries with this though. It goes through them like water!
4,Nikon SB-600 Speedlight Flash,"I'd received my Nikon SB-600 approximately six weeks ago, and have found the controls easy to master and my resultant pictures properly exposed.I'm not sure whether the flash/camera (Nikon D80) is mainly responsible for the quality of the exposure, but I'm quite happy with the results.Previously I was plagued with subject blur or under-exposed pictures (indoors), but that issue was resolved with the purchase of this flash.I thought the flip-down diffuser was a nice touch, as I don't have to search for it in my bag, its always-there ready to deploy.The cycle-time is very quick, and seems to keep up with my needs.I'd recommend this flash for anyone looking for a good, all-around flash unit!"
5,Great Performance for Great Photos,"Very useful for indoor events - birthday parties, dinner parties, etc.Much better lighting by bouncing flash off ceiling, resulting in much better photos."
5,Excellent and Reliable Flash!!,"I purchased this flash from Samy's Camera back around 2006, it was my first flash ever, and until this day i am still using it (A LOT) and this is in the original condition, never failed, never had it repaired. It has worked for me without any problems whatsoever and this is the ONLY flash i have and used. I am very impressed by its performance. When my dad bought his D300 he bought the big giant and heavy SB900 and i told him he did not need that big flash. The SB600 is all you could ever need, at least that has been my case, this flash is even more powerfull than the SB700. NEWER BIGGER flash devices are also way more complicated than this one, and unecessary if you don't use them for what they are intended.Not much more to say about it, is really great yet simple!"
5,"Best Ever, cant ask for more","I am a professional photographer who shoots 250 homes a year for the MLS service. I bracket those shots and do real virtual tours, meaning the flash does about 500 exposures per home. My last 2 SB600 flashes worked flawlessly for three years. Now they are replaced by the more expensive 800. No Problem. When it comes to working first shot till last, Nikon serves me well."
3,"Good results, but expensive and UNRELIABLE","I like the photos this flash takes esp with a diffuser but it frequently stops working for no reason at all. In my job, I need to know that I can go indoors and shoot photos without worry. This is now non functioning for the third time in a few weeks so I am now in the market for another flash unfortunately."
5,Perfect!,"I got the flash in no time, perfect condition and exactly the way as it was described. Thank you so much!"
5,Nikon Flash,Love it. When I first brought it home I had my grandson hide in a dark room and I just pointed and took shots aroung the room as a game of hide and seek to see how good the flash was and when we looked at the photos I won the game. The flash was powerful enough to find my grandson in the dark room. It was great.
4,A word of Warning for CoolPix owners,"I bought this for use with my CoolPix 5000 camera because Nikon's tech support had recomended it. They said it would improve my indoor shots (because the CP 5000 has a terrible flash built-in), but instead it overloads the shots and they come out mostly white. I read the manual carefully and it looks like the reason is that this flash is built to automatically or manually focus the light for a 14mm to 70mm lense and the CP 5000 has a 7.2mm lense. I subsequently purchased a Nikon D70s camera (1,000,000 times better camera) and this flash is great for extremely dark shots on that camera (though the built-in flash is perfect for fill so this is really only for night shots and shots in darkness where I want to get something far away). If you own a CoolPix camera, consider buying a used flash that isn't as powerfull. If you own a D70s and want superior night photography, this is the best flash in the world (good thing I ended up in the latter end of the spectrum)."
3,"Nikon para Nikon,caro y de corta duracion.","Este producto es muy delicado y se daño con poco uso, aunque tenia 1 año y 6 meses con el, lo use muy poco y ya se me daño sin dejarlo caer, sin mojarlo, no entiendo como un producto tan caro , porque solo por ser marca Nikon , ya hay que pagar por el nombre, es tan caro y de tan poca duracion. Comprare otra marca para mi camara Nikon D-90, en verdad el dinero no sobra y por eso no lo recomiendo."
3,Economical Flash from Nikon,It was not built as strong+good as the previous model (old SB for Film-SLR). Other than that it works perfectly.
2,This flash has a defect that Nikon won't fix.,"I have read numerous reviews on the SB 600 that reflects my own disappointment. After about six months of ownership, the display on the back of the flash began flashing rather than holding a steady view. I have tried resetting it, changing the batteries, etc. but it still does it. It does not seem to affect the flash but its very annoying, especially since no one seems to know how to fix it. I would not buy another one but would pay the additional money for the SB 800."
5,SB-600,"I've been shooting for a few years now and have always wanted a flash for my equipment. Looked at the sb800 as well but, just dont have the cash just yet. This flash would be a great compliment with a Nikon D70 or the likes with commander mode. Im using a D50 and it mounted to the camera works for me until i upgrade. I was able to shoot about 250 until i needed to change the batteries due to it taking too long to recycle. Overall I am pleased with this flash and would highly recommend it to any level photographer."
5,very good price,This was the cheapest price that I found on the internet and I've bought this product at the same time with nikon D200 and works well together. Thanks AMAZON
2,Couldn't ask for more....other than an English Manual!,"In a nutshell, the SB-600 is a must-have for anyone taking photography seriously. You really don't understand the difference this will make in your photos until you try it. I was worried about paying $200 for what is basically a flashlight, but I couldn't regret it less. My only concern? Why are my manuals entirely in Spanish? I had to download the English version off of NikonUSA's website..Edir as of Sept. 11/2010 (Three days after purchase.)Last night, the day after I had received it in the mail, the SB-600 exploded in my face. How else can I describe it? The flash bulb BLEW UP. It's totaled. I did nothing but take pictures with the thing on AUTO. Returning now. My rating has gone down to a 2 star, because, while it was great while it worked....it exploded after two days of use, and, again, no English manuals."
5,More than I expected.,The flash work well and easy to use. It perform for me what must consider to be outstanding and using rechargable batteries I took over 350 photos at night with no problems.
2,Easy to use but poor quality.,"I bought the SB600 to go with my D80, primarily because of its ease of use but also because of Nikon's reputation for quality. Most of my pictures are taken outside, so I se a flash rarely. This particular flash has been used no more than 40 times and exclusively with my D80. It has never goten wet and was never dropped. It quite suddenly stopped workjng. One day it worked fine the next day it was as dead as if it contained no batteries. Of course the warranty has expired and Nikon wants $117.00 to repair. Maybe I got a lemon, but I am not the only person who has written in concerning the subpar quaility of the SB 600 This leads to my resolve to avoid Nikon products in the future. If anyone out there is in the market for a flash, you should think twice about buying the this on and most certainly stay away from a used one."
4,Nikon SB600 Flash - Great!!,"This is a great flash. It works on my Nikon D90 in the hotshoe, via the wireless commander mode, or on the remote cable. The head turns up or sideways. The menus on the display are more cryptic than they need to be but it doesn't take much to get used to them. All in all this is a great flash....wish I could say the same for the D90 I put it on."
5,Really enjoying this flash,"This flash has been a blast to use. It is of course far superior to the built in flash on my d80 for both range and color balance. I find it easy to attach and detach, the build quality is great. With just a little bit of time spent reading the manual, I have been using this flash both on the camera and triggered remotely. I used the remote feature to light a glass of colored liquid from underneath, a very cool effect that would have required all sorts of set up other wise. I have also used the remote feature to shoot pictures of 50 plus student paintings and it performed flawlessly. I love it."
5,Phenomenal lighting! Wish I would have bought sooner!,I have taken my indoor photos to a whole new level with this flash. I bought it for my friend's wedding and I wish I would have gotten it sooner.I am using in conjunction with my Nikon D40 and a newStroboframe Press-T Flash Rotating Bracketfor portait photography. See review and photos there...Flash features that I love:1. Full tilt - from 90 degrees to 180 degrees with several stops - I bounce off the ceiling most of the time for lovely natural lighting2. Built in pull out diffuser that can also be used for angle bounce3. Head rotation from -90 degrees to 180 degrees (perfect for portrait photography with a flash frame to point to the ceiling)4. Flash refresh rate is fantastic! I set the camera on a tripod and with the remote took many family photos in a row! Especially necessary when there are crying babies in the group!5. Batteries last a long time6. Includes nice protective case for flash
4,Fits my needs with auto functions,It is much easier to do nice pictures indoor also in big halls with this flash. Much better then with internal flash on my D300. Zooming function works also well. I need to practice bounce flash more but for direct use for example on objects that are far away or use in a big rooms it works well. In short distance it could be little softer or I would recommend additional diffuser even I didn't try any by myself (it has builtin 14mm wide angle diffuser which is quite ok)
2,Died young,"A little over one year after purchase, it won't turn on. Seems like it's completely dead. I tried different batteries with no luck. It's been used gently, and not more than a few times a month. When not in use I kept it in the soft case it came with, inside my camera bag. I did a little reading, and it seems like I'm not the only one that had this problem. It's a pity, this flash was wonderful while it did work. But I would expect a piece of equipment like this to last longer than it did."
4,Don't settle for the Built-In Flash,"If you can't pony up for the SB-800, then seriously consider the SB-600 instead. Yes, the built-in flash from Nikon works in a pinch, but you already know the built-in sucks which is why you're here reading this.The flash isn't a simple pop-on and run (unless you're just doing snapshots). Instead, read the intensive manual and you'll appreciate having this unit."
4,Great for bouncing flash!,"I bought the speedlight because as part of my business I do birth photography Many times, mom will wish to labor in the dark or dimly lit light, making shooting difficult. On camera flash is too harsh and ugly so I purchased the SB-600. I am *SO* glad I did! Bouncing the flash makes for beautiful photos and great fill light, it's still just as portable and doesn't add too much weight to the camera. I do not recommend this product for indoor portraiture use, however, unless you had another light and had them firing off camera."
5,Must-have for your DSLR!,"This is my first review on Amazon after many years. All i can say is, WOW. This flash is awesome, it really makes the camera (Nikon D-70s) shine and realise its full potential. Even looking at your photos on the camera's LCD, you can appreciate the improvement in colour and depth that this flash delivers. It is automatic, and adjusts for the range as you pan or zoom. Really impressive, if you have spent $700 to take really good pictures with a good DSLR, you need this flash!!!"
5,Best DSLR Accessory for Me,I take a lot of family pictures since having had a baby. Buying this flash is the best purchase that I ever made for my photography. The difference that it makes is just astounding.
5,Excellent product,This product is as advertised. Excellent product. Shipped very quickly. Very happy with transaction.
5,great product,I bought this for my boyfriend for christmas. He loves it. Says it is very comfortable and has no complaints about it.
1,Disappointing Mozart,"I'd always heard that Curzon was a fine Mozartian, however on all the occasions that I've heard his recordings, I'd been disappointed. Unfortunately, this live recording does nothing to change my initial impression. The Barenboim-Curzon partnership is a poor one, and there appears to be no clear common conception with regards to performing Mozart. This is a case where opposites fail to attract. The B-flat concerto is no less uninspiring. The tempo is too slow to bring out Mozart's charm and playfulness, but is also too slow to convey depth or poetic fantasy. This is stuffy Mozart, which gives academic interpretations a poor reputation."
1,Doesn't do justice to the performers or composer,"This CD was a terrible disappointment. When I bought it, I was not aware that it was recorded at a live concert. Apparently the engineering was very poor because the sound of the pianos is not well balanced and the pianos are not well tuned. In addition, someone in the audience is coughing throughout the concert. I am sorry I wasted my money on what should have been a beautiful recording."
1,These are NOT MD1-0002 filters,"Instead, these filters are approximately 1/2 the size of the MD1-0002 filters that are sold by Amazon."
2,Misrepresented Product,"I received a different filter than what was pictured. Specifically, the replacement filter received is not made by Vornado and does not hold up as well."
2,Misleading product description,"This is not a ""MD1-0002 Vornado Humidifier Replacement Filter (2-Pack)"", this a a 3rd-party replacement for a Vornado MD1-0002 filter. That is, I didn't receive what I had ordered and what I was expecting to be delivered. When I contacted the seller about this, I was told 1) I could ship what they sent me back, but only at my own expense; 2) If I wanted a genuine Vornado MD1-0002 filter, I would need to re-place the order under a product listing I could find on Amazon by searching on the string ""B000063D2P"". I find all of this very fishy & would recommend avoiding this seller."
1,Not correct filter!,This is NOT a Vornado filter. It a cheap knock-off which isn't the correct thickness. Don't buy this!
1,"Again, NOT genuine filters...poorly fitting, poor performance.","Again, NOT genuine filters...poorly fitting, poor performance. These filters are adequate, but they don't perform well. I have had them in the past and begrudgingly used them."
5,These are indeed Vornado brand Filters,"I know many reviewers have commented that the filters they received weren't Vornado brand. I ordered in January 2013 and I can confirm these are indeed Vornado brand. They're the exact same box that I've been buying at my local big big store. I did purchase these directly from Amazon. I'm wondering if those folks who received non-Vornado brand filters ordered from an Amazon seller instead of Amazon directly. At any rate, I've been pleased with my filters. No complaints. They work as advertised in my Vornado humidifier and last about two weeks."
1,Wrong item or item not to specs,This item I received is not the wick filter advertised. Both the Amazon item model number and the description state the model number is MD1-0002. The package I received stated the model number as MD1-0001. It also does not fit my Vornado humidifier.
1,not what you're expecting,These filters do not fit our Vornado humidifier at all - don't be fooled by their description. I just cut one in half and hope it will work.
4,A writer takes her dream trip to London,"This is the true story of a writer's dream trip to London, when her decades-long correspondence with a London antiquarian book shop becomes an unexpected best-seller. Helen Hanff wrote television scripts and juvenile histories, but what she really was was a passionate and highly eclectic reader. Almost entirely self-taught, based on the writings of Quiller-Couch (which she wrote about in a book called ""Q's Legacy), her unpretentious and ferociously curious mind and charming (if irasasible) personality are as delightfully engaging to the reader as they were to the staff at 84 Charing Cross Road. In this real-life Cinderella story, Hanff's dream of a trip to England finally comes true. She visits the places she has always dreamed of and finds friends and fans everywhere she goes. What a pleasure to be able to accompany her"
3,If you are a fan,"Helene Hanff kept up a correspondence with a book friend in London for twenty years. Finally, after publishing a book composed of letters between the two, Hanff gets an opportunity to travel to London. Of course, she will never get to meet her friend, who died before her letters were published. Nevertheless, she makes the trip and meets many fans of her book.As is usual for me, I liked the original story better than the sequels."
5,Second Half of '84 Charing Cross',"Finally able to visit London, the author leaves the statesand describes vividly her experiences there. Lively, funand brief. Quite satisfying.I felt I knew Helene...."
5,Great shocks,"Installed on the rear of my motorhome. IMHO, Reflex shocks are every bit as good as some of the pricier competition. I had mediocre experiences with Monroe's other lower-priced shocks but these seem well worth the price."
4,Some help for a Parkinsons patient,This seat helps greatly when rising from the commode. Every little bit helps when there are muscle and nerve issues.
2,Do not like it,"I'm not sure if this is real hematite, because it is not magnetic. Other hematite that I have purchased from other sellers is magnetic. I also do not like the way it looks. It looks cheap, and you can see the seam where it was glued together. It does not look right. I would not wear this item, but I do not have time right now to worry about re-packaging it and sending it back, so I guess I will just have to consider it a loss. Other than that, shipping was fast, and there were also no problems with packaging... just did not like the item."
1,"Must have been an ""accident"" that this book wqas written","When a teenager's four friends are killed in an auto accident he gets suspicous as to what realy happened. He keeps turning to his friend whose on the police force for help.All the characters in this book are stupid and annoting and the ending says immoralaty and dishohonestly is okay. When the mystery is solve your not realy thrilled. The book is also very depressing with how the characters live. This is probably the worst book I have ever read. The mystery in this book is how it ever got published. If ya need to read a terrible book I highly suggest ""The Accident."""
1,Must have been an 'Accident' that this book was created,The stupid story is about a teenager whose four friends are killed in an accdient caused by drunk driving and there is mystery for the teenager to solve about waht realy happened. Every character in this book is STUPID or ARRIGANT the ending of the book suggests its OK to denie the truth for goo reputation. The main character teenager is stupid and stubern for not letting go and being obsessive. His girlfriend is stubern for not being supportive. The parents of one of the victims of the accident are very sleasy. THIS IS PROBALY THE WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ! I hope people are reading this review so that if they want to read a book that is totaly evil and ignorant. This book has stuff in it that wouldn't be appropriate at all in real life. This book is straight trash!
1,Not Much Insight,"This book was a real disappointment. It barely skims the surface on Freddie Mercury's life, and offers no insight into upbringing, family life, or the influence his Persian heritage had on his development. Freestone gambles on the assumption that the readers will already be well versed on the biographical history of Mercury, which isn't so in my case. I'm left with more questions than answers, and would have appreciated more discussion of his pre-Queen years, the relationships between band members, love interests, and how he dealt with his illness. Information wise this title will leave all but die hard fans out in the cold."
2,another fable bites the dust....yeah yeah,"Is this the real life?I think Pheobes writting in fantasy,is my best accolade for this undesireable memoir.Taken as a costume designer by Freddie ,Mr Freestone accounts for very little in this memoir----apart from his memory may not serve him well these days.As to account as a memoir ,I think Pheobe should recite some more opera to fullfill the meaning of memoir. With little regard to scandal or the need of more fact in the late Mercury,I regard this title .....CASHING IN ON A DUE,THAT OBVIOUSLY Mr Freestone thiks he deserves??????.Strange but true what the millions of fans world wide need is?????not this title but an accurate account of Mercurys days as deplicted by his lover Jim Hutton(MERCURY&ME).Surely Mr Freestone could have accounted for missed years ?instead of grinding on what has been. Tomorrows fish & chips is what i accept will end as this title."
4,Excellent,"What Peter Freestone has done here is dispel and/or correct the many rumours and myths surrounding the life of Freddie Mercury. It is not a straightforward biography, but an intensely personal account of the last twelve years of Mercury's life, during which time Peter Freestone was his personal assistant and close friend. Freestone still remains fiercely loyal and wants us to understand the sort of devotion that those close to Mercury gave to him. He describes not just a rock star and a legend, but a fascinating man who was, by all accounts, one of a kind. Readers hoping to hear about Mercury's early life will be disappointed, but those wanting a behind-the-scenes, what-he-was-really-like account will love this book, as I did."
2,Start with a different book,I was fascinated by some video performances so I wanted to find out more about Mercury. Read some good reviews of this book about it not being sensationalistic & a hack job. Unfortunately for me it didn't give me the kind of info that I was looking for. Definitely a book for someone who has more of a background in Mercury's history.
1,Horrendous writing,"I found this unreadable. The writing was horrendous, as if Freestone dictated it into an audio recorder and someone transcribed it. He goes off on tangents and writes about only a small portion of Mercury's life. What he does write about is mostly his own life inside Queen. I gave up after Chapter 1. All I could do, at that point, was skim it trying to find some coherent sentences. I failed in that regard and went on to another book."
4,Excellent,A must have for Freddie fans who want to know how he was and how he lived the goods and not so goods. I liked the detail and content around people that interfaced with Freddie. It is now easy to understand why Queen were so good at what they did.The book keeps away from other Queens band members and I would have liked to know a little more about their interfaces and thoughts of Freddie. Sad butlearning end for a brilliant artist. He will live on for a long time through his music
2,Sum of their parts,"I'm a queen fan, the first 4 or 5 albums I felt were quite groundbreaking and Mercury was a pivotal influence. However this book didn't give me any insight into who this person was, it felt like Freddie lived a life of the perennial teenager with no real depth of emotion or intelligence which I'm sure was far from the truth.The details of what curtains he liked or the fact he loved old movies was dull, no real mention was made of how he worked or a hint of any belief structure made this a disappointing read."
1,I don't think I can get through this book.,"I have read probably half of this book, and I'm having a hard time getting through it. It's very poorly written and even boring in parts."
5,Learn more about Freddie as a person.,"I love this book because I wanted to know more about him as a person. I enjoyed reading about his favorite foods and how he decorated Garden Lodge. I've been a BIG fan since 1974 and this is one of my favorite books...and I have almost all of them. Even though I had Jim Hutton's book ""Mercury And Me"", I didn't think it was all true. This book seems to be all true and written by his closest employee and friend. Peter stayed loyal too by not writing about any negatives or extremely personal matters."
1,Boring!,"This is one of the most one sided, self serving books I have every read. It was also extremely boring!"
3,Product description misleading,"Only the canasters are magnetic. The mount is not. The product description stating that you can use it on verticle surfaces lead me to believe that the entire product could be placed on a steal surface, such as your refrigerator. That is why i bought this. Unfortunately you have to screw holes in your wall and mount it with screws. Other than that its a good product."
2,Not worth the money,"We used our unit for about two months in our gameroom before the power supply/fan gave up the ghost. It did get used frequently by our two children and their friends but was never left on for more than one or two hours at a time. Unfortunately, even that level of usage was too much for the unit to handle.We found out quickly that the unit functioned more as a cooler and that drinks needed to be chilled prior to being placed in the machine. Now that my husband has taken out the non-functioning power supply, we just use it as a standard cooler with a novelty twist. I wish that I had read the previous review before my handyman husband threw out the old cord because he would have been able to do the modifications easily.I would certainly never recommend that anyone purchase this product."
1,A Big Disappointment,"I purchased this item as a gift for my 13 year old because of it's nostalgic appeal. It was really cute, but that's about the only good thing that I can say. It did a really poor job of keeping the cans in place, they frequently rolled out the back and down through the dispenser. The biggest disappointment was that it only lasted about two months. The cooling device quit, rendering the unit useless. It was definitely a bad choice and I would have been better off purchasing a small refrigerator."
4,Interesting reading,"After meditating daily for twenty years I found the Monroe institutes programs and discovered how easily levels of conscienceness can change. There are many doorways yet unopened untill someone points us toward a key. Here we find another brother on the quest pointing toward an opening in the fabric of our exsistance. The option to walk through it or turn away is, of course, ours."
2,For Entertainment Purposes....,"The author, Courtney Brown, tells us he has proof that he is going to share with the reader but never provides it. There is no independent proof given in this account except his ""monitor"". I can only conclude that this is either entirely fiction or mostly fiction and it should be viewed that way. I don't doubt that some elements of remote viewing work since psychics have been around for centuries, and more recently have had success with law enforcement, but this book goes way off the deep end. Make no mistake, this book is fiction. If Mr. Brown could do what he claims he can, he'd due it in a public forum like television away from his followers."
5,"mind opener to things beyond ""the credible world""","I found this book one of the best on the subject of life outside our every day affairs. The author puts into perspective all of the diffrent ideas and/or facts that have been written on the UFO / Abduction literature, that so far have been dificult to classify and categorize due to the nature of the subject. To me, this book is a must for any one intrested on some of the aspects the future will bring to all of us as a race and no doubt some very important ones.One defect the book has for me is the unanswered questions that the author himself knows there are and that he could have found the answer with the technics and abilities he has.Worth to read with an open mind!"
5,A great collection of 101 actual ways to win.,"You get a great collection of 101 different systems/methods to win at craps. The book is divided into ten chapters like Place, Buy & Lay, Tournaments, Prop bets, Pass/Come, etc and each of these has 5-10 different systems written specially for that kind of bet. There is also a lot of info on dice control. At the end there is a good glossary, resources section, index and a coupon section. You can find several good systems on just about any part of the craps game in this book. They aren't rated or anything so we get to pick and choose the ones we like the best. I like don't betting and there lots of those. I don't think everyone will like everything in this book but you are bound to get your money's worth, even you just get 4 or 5 good money making systems from it."
1,Craps Craps,"Not worth the effort of reading. A lot of suggested approaches, but very confusing. Requires re-reading to grasp suggestions."
5,"littlewalks, bighit","My 18 month old daughter loves this DVD! It's not often that I can get her to sit still for 30 minutes, but when this is on, she doesn't move. the other nice thing about this video is that it's also adult-friendly. Great music, great footage, no annoying characters that sing. A refreshing break from the usual children's video. I highly recommend it."
5,Groovy music on a kids DVD? It's possible!!!,"You know how ""those songs"" get stuck in your head--for the entire day? Well, these will too but the genius is that they're acually good! We've had this DVD for a few years and both of my kids L-O-V-E it; it's great for all ages and it's fun to see how each kid reacts to different street scenes. It's also very calming background noise for a parent who just needs a few minutes to get dinner ready. I hope there are more of these DVDs in the works!!!"
5,Kids love this video....,"I went to visit my friend in Washington. She has a two year old daughter with a discerning video habit. I brought her this video (being from New York). We put it in the player and she was captivated. The images of New York against the wonderful mix of music was enchanting...(we were also drawn in!)If you want your child to watch something fun and fascinating, without the music driving you crazy. This is the video. I'm going to give it to all my friends with kids!!"
3,Gottschalk: Piano Music for 2 and 4 hands,"I really wanted to give this CD set 2.5 stars. I like the music. The artists are adequate if not stellar. But the acoustics and recording quality are awful. It sounds like it was recorded in a high school gym using a cassette recorder / player.Sorry I can't be more positive, but I was disappointed."
3,Works as expected but manufactured in china not USA,"This product as usual is an item manufactured in China. Not an original replacement which was manufactured originally in USA. But works as expected. I know quite a few people who are in the process of watching this replacement before they do theirs. You got to love condos, mirror images."
4,perfect fit,"perfectly replaced my old lock which was broken, better than replacing the whole door. cheapest ive found on the internet also. other sites wanted $100+."
4,"Good 4 the body, mind & soul. Inspiring!","This book, along with many of Mandino's books, will help anyone with low self-esteem, high dreams and expectations, or simple questions about the things that are going on in your life. My grandmother introduced me to Og Mandino with the book ""Greatest Salesman in the World"" and I read and reread that book. If you are looking for motivation, his books have lots of ""advice"" that could put you into gear, and go for the goal. Mr. Mandino is a genius. I would love to meet him one day. ""The Choice"" helped my brother to come to terms with lots of complications in his life. You come to realize that life is how you choose to make it. Other people cannot bring you happiness, you must choose to live a happy life, by your own means."
5,Listen to this...,"...probably, the best Israel Vibes album. Check it out and tell me what o you think."
5,How you make yourself angry and what to do about it,"This type of self help can be used in all areas of our lives. It helped me take control of how I feel and how I express my feeling. If you get angry or depressed, these these techniques will help."
1,A waste of time :-(,"A waste of time, unless you're a specialist in the field of theoretical analysis of abstract concept...Definitely the least interesting, least practical and most boring book on the subject out of 4 or 5 I've read...There are much (much) better books on the subject!"
3,understanding your anger,"I read this book primarily for two reasons. I am a nursing student and I have to do a review on this book, as well examine this book for myself. I thought this book had realistic ideals on how people handle their anger as well as what we feel. When it came to discussing the ABC's of anger it left me in a stump. When you write a book you should in lamins terms explain everything as if the audience has no clue in what you are talking about. I believe that in this book they wrote it as if we knew exactly what he was pointing out when in reality it was confusing. It helps there again point out views but it doesn't really lay it out in fine print on what to do with your emotions, and feelings of anger."
4,I only wanted the box,"The truth is that I only bought this for the collector's box. I already own the series and wanted to box to it, and for $5 I couldn't pass it up. The series itself is something i probably wouldn't recommend to anyone because the plot itself doesn't make much sense. Things happen with no meaning at all, and all it would do is confuse you if you were expecting some sort of logic to it. If you ignore all of that and take things at face value I believe you will enjoy it much more. I do love watching this series just because of how much it doesn't make sense and I enjoy watching it every time.Just beware that this series is not for everyone."
3,Classic Cartoon Favorites ~ Best Pals Mickey & Pluto,Cute collection of vintage Mickey Mouse and Pluto cartoons. The best of Disney. Always good for a laugh. Great for the kids.
2,Not very entertaining for 2 year-olds.,"Hardly any talking and not very entertaining for 2 year-old kids. This is more of a collectors DVD as compared to Elmo, Barney, etc., this is boring. Too bad - they do love Mickey Mouse."
2,Just not for me,"Loved the look of the shoes and great service, but shoe just didnt fit my foot. Not much cushion in the heel for me."
3,Fun but Fragile,"We purchased this doll for our daughter and had the same experience as the previous reviewer - shortly after removing the doll from the hideous packaging (we actually got it out without incident) the head snapped off! Rather than go through the trouble of exchanging, I superglued it back on. Our daughter loves this doll in the collection, but the construction is highly suspect - we can only hope Mattel remedies this problem..."
2,Ideal for fine hair,"So light it feels like a toy. Blows like one too. Air is neither not enough nor powerful enough for thicker hair.The barrel is great though - the ""teeth"" really gripped my hair. But it was a waste of money."
3,Not Exactly Tangle-Free,"The brush iron isn't exactly tangle-free as advertised, and I have short hair. The release button doesn't work well either. I'm not one that is good at hair styling, and I was hoping this item would help, but it didn't. Maybe it's just me??"
5,Great Service,Received product with no problem from US to Canada. Bought it this way because my hairdresser charges way too much. I can get two this way for what I usually get charged for one. Thanks.
3,Not bad,I have hard to deal with hair but this hot air brush does a pretty good job. It doesn't get as hot as I would like but other than that it does the trick...just takes a bit longer.
4,Just what I needed for quick styling,"I have very fine thin hair and have to really coax it to curl. I was impressed with my Helen of Troy hot curler and when my old Conair hot air brush quit I bought this as a replacement. The ""curl release"" mechanism is great, no need to unwind the brush and it's never caused a tangle which the Conair did on occasion. My only reason for 4 stars over 5 is that it makes very loud vibration noises on the high setting. Others might not be bothered by this and it may be just a quirk but because it's held close to my ears I really had to find a solution. I noticed when I tightly gripped the handle it was quieter so I wrapped the handle very tightly with some plastic packing tape with good results. Otherwise my hair dresser confirmed the quality of the Helen of Troy product line."
2,"Ultimately, a piece of junk!","Looks great but it sounds like a vacuum cleaner on its last legs. I had this styler for three months and it overheated three times. I have medium hair and also used a regular blow dryer before I used this styler to lessen its strain. Yesterday, It started its ""death rattle"" and smelled like it was burning so I turned it off and it would not come back on even after it had cooled down. I did NOT overwork this styler and it was not abused. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Piece of junk,"This hot air brush is not even worth 1 star. It is far from tangle free. If you want to keep your hair, don't buy this piece of junk."
5,Best Hot Air Brush Around!,"This Helen of Troy hot hair hir brush is ""kind"" to your hair. The rubber bristles in the iron do not break or tangle in your hair. The curl it leaves is great. The 3/4""iron I found to be diffucalt to locate in the stores. I have looked in several. The larger Helen of Troy Iron seems to be the most located. I have one and used it when my hair was longer so knew I wanted the same brand. However, my hair being shorter now .. need the smaller iron. Had to go online to find it and YEA! I did! Has the release button and is kind to my hair. I highly reccomend this product!"
1,Disappointed,"This book contains flawed analysis (on the Möller Attack and others) which is really not acceptable. The book gives a glimpse of several major openings (to its credit) but stops its analysis arbitrarily and does not really emphasise the fundamental underlying principles which it claims to do. It is patchy and not good. I feel like Chris Ward must have written this book while he was bored one day, and it took him less than an hour..."
1,WHAT trust fund?,"The Social Security Tax was challenged in the Supreme Court shortly after it was passed into law. The government's lawyers argued...""These are true taxes,"" they stated, ""their purpose simply being to raise revenue.... The proceeds are paid into the Treasury as internal revenue collections, available for the general support of the government.""They HAD to take that position, to keep the tax from being struck down on constitutional grounds.The court ruled in favor of the government. In the summary, the court stated...""The proceeds of both taxes (SS and unemployment) are to be paid into the Treasury like internal-revenue taxes generally, and are not earmarked in any way.""There is not, and never has been a true SS trust fund or ""retirement account"" to loot. Any excess funds are replaced by government bonds (IOU's) and the money deposited in the general spending account. That's the way the system was designed."
5,Ideal introduction to the land of Ansalon,"The PG (Player's Guide) series is a well-crafted, ""user-friendly"" set of guidebooks that introduces new players to the worlds of TSR. The approach is refreshingly light and engaging (gamespeak and rhetoric are kept to an absolute minimum), and as primary overviews of classic campaign worlds, these colorful sourcebooks are ideal! This one details the world of Krynn - chapters include lore on the geography of Ansalon, the cultures (including gully dwarves and kender), the gods, the histories of the Cataclysm, the mysterious Lost Peoples, monsters, and much more!"
3,Way too much Figaro! Not enough Mickey and Minnie!,"Bought this for my 2.5 yr old son who loves the old Disney cartoons. There are way too many Figaro shorts and only a few Mickey and Minnie ones. Took him a while to enjoy it, but we were totally expecting more Mickey. Good buy though. Quick shipping from Goodwill Southern California."
4,Cute Collection :],"I expected a bit more of Mickey and Minnie , but oh well. This DVD was still very enjoyable, my niece loved it and that's all that matters. (she got introduced to Figuro who she seems to adore lol)"
5,Love Walt Disney,"My children are really enjoying all the cartoons with Mickey, Donald, Goofy, and Pluto. It is money well spent! No one does it like Walt Disney! They are fun to watch at any age and so much better than the garbage they call cartoons today."
5,Really cute cartoons,"This is a sweet DVD with classic Mickey Cartoons. These older cartoons (from the 1940's - 1960's) are really cute and a lot less violent then Looney Tunes. Older kids might find them too tame, but my 4 year old daughter absolutley loves them and watches them all of the time. My only complaint is that Disney could have fit more cartoons on the disc. They have a whole series and obviously want you to buy more!"
2,Not quite as bad as album cover,"If anyone could get past what is possibly the worst cover art on an album ever there is a mediocre C.D. inside. Lil Flip has since blown up and crossed over to become a commercial success. His patented slow as molasses flow is sometimes tedious to listen to. His vocabulary and subject matter are limited on this album. The ""Trojans"" song was a regional hit. There really aren't any stand out tracks on the album, I'd pass and pick up the Underground Legend album."
5,H-town does it again....,"Yo, This cd is pimp, along with all of his underground cds. Flip lives up to his name of tha freestyle king. Get this cd and any of the other suckafree or swishahouse playas, it'd be the best thang you did..."
3,Pretty good,"This is maybe Lil Flip's best lyrical effort. The beats are solid, yet not outstanding at all. ""I Got Flow,"" ""I Can Do Dat,"" and ""Dirty Souf,"" are standout tracks in my opinion. In the end, Undaground King is a stronger album from Flip. I'd rather listen to this one than U Gotta Feel Me though."
1,What was he thinking....,"This CD is even worse than the ""undaground legend"" CD. He is not an underground legend. I'm asking you not to buy this CD. Every song on this CD is much worse than his newer ""undaground legend"" CD. Trust me I know what I'm talking about. If I could I'd give this negative one stars. I don't know what in gods green earth he was thinking to make a CD cover like this either. This CD along with his other(s) is an embarrasment to the city that he is from, Houston, TX."
4,My daughter loves it!,"My daughter received this for her 4th birthday. She already had two of the these mini dolls and really enjoyed it. A relative found this and we were both glad ~ my daughter loved the new doll and extra clothes and I loved that she could store her other dolls, and their accessories all in it. Very handy... The only reason I gave it 4 intead of 5 was because the latch to close it sometimes takes a little messing with to get it to latch right (which my daughter sometimes becomes frustrated with). But otherwise its great!"
4,cool,yes All barbies come in black you can go on [...] and also get a free play mat for mini barbies.
2,DOES IT ALSO COME IN BLACK BARBIE?,WENT TO THE STORE THERE WAS NO DIVERSITY THERE DOES IT COME IN BLACK ALSO?
4,el cajon.,A good instructional dvd in spanish with english subtitles on the flamenco style of cajon playing.Its easy to follow but I would not recommend it to a beginner. Best suited to intermediate players.But still worth the while to have a look at if you are into playing the cajon.
1,I thought i would love it but...,"Honestly I would never buy Tribeca again, it's the dollar store version of Kenneth Cole. It was cheap and stiff if you decide to buy some buy a 1/2 size larger. They are all synthetic which is why I was so dissapointed. I bought from another sight which stated they were patent leather. This says they are Patent (in one paragraph) but they are ""FAUX"" patent leather. I guess Tribeca is not a leather goods company, ""high fashion at cheaper prices"" but they go faux. None for me thanks!!"
3,Interesting but lacking cohesion,What does one say about a work like this? It's an interesting premise. It's well written. It's provocative. It portrays 99% of America as idiots. And it lacks cohesion - sometimes it reads more like an extended vehicle for the author's liberal ranting and raving about contemporary culture than anything else. Five stars for the premise and the research; one star for the sniping and heckling.
3,A Debt to Debord,"It is a good sign (if only to know that we are not alone) when anyone critically discusses the disappointing, alientating society in which so many do not really live, but instead pretend to live, acting on recieved values and donning cloned identities. Yet, I was extremely disappointed that the author made no mention, that I could find, of Guy Debord, the Situationists, and particularly Debord's Society of the Spectacle, which seems the appropriate starting point for this one and only truly human discussion. Those of us who have learned to live again know a good place to go to get the real goods. Unfortunately, the population in this mental space is still a bit thin."
2,Another flop of a Life,"Remarkable and lamentable by what it manages to ignore this workis more an example of what it tries to describe than an implementfor its understanting! That Gabler manages to write a book aboutthe spectacular engulfing of the everyday without engaging theviews of Guy Debord, Herbert Marcuse, Goddfrey Reggio, Georges Perec, Vince Packard or David Riesman is in itself a testemonial of how entertainment effectively compresses the depth of any analysis of its effects to a waffer thin prespective! What is advertised as revelatory soon is revealed as the author's emphatuation with his own subject. Wwept by the uncontainable wave of superficiality that he purports to denounce, Gabler is already a stand-in in the movie called Life, the delusion hefully welcomes in his naive reconning..."
1,"Too awful to finish, even for curiosity's sake.","ugh, we received this as gift in part of a 3 dvd Adam & Eve collection including Flashpoint, Conquest, and Dream Quest. After about 30 minutes this dvd was joyously ejected and added to a short stack of films that were ""too awful to finish.""A co-ed firehouse has the potential for lots of sexy hijinx, but this film opens with a real downer: the tragic loss of a fireman and his graveside funeral complete with grieving widow. This is followed by two uninspired action scenes, followed by a dream-sequence-slow-mo-group-scene which I turned off in disgust, all of which was poorly edited with very little consideration for visual continuity or the progression from point A to point B.After watching the other two videos in this collection, which might still be fun to watch if the action were glossed over and merely implied, this flick was a real disappointment."
3,This is the cable version...,"I bought this for a bachelor party, I was disappointed to learn that this is the cable version, even though it doesn't say so on the listing. Just an FYI to other buyers."
3,"Good design, poor execution","Pros: It's solid. Great concept, great design. Fast and easy to clean. Much less of a hassle than our electric Black & Decker juicer.Cons: It doesn't work well. We tried oranges and grapefruits, halves and quarters. It just doesn't close far enough to squeeze every last bit of juice out. I squeezed a quarter of a grapefruit, and even though I got a pretty good amount of juice, I was still able to eat what was leftover - and it was still juicier than some of the non-squeezed grapefruits I've had. I can see where it might have a good application, but if you just want a glass of orange juice, it's not the most efficient way."
3,Can't get much juice out,"I was so happy with the lemon squeezer that I got this one too. I have a navel orange tree in my yard and I thought this would make life easier for me. As one reviewer noted, once you start squeezing, the lip of the orange half would get folded in. I also think that because navel oranges are too meaty, the holes get plugged by the meat and juice doesn't come out. I always finish up by hand. On the bright side, since the orange has already been squished, squeezing it even by one hand is pretty easy. I think this would work better if the diameter of the squeezer was made a little bigger. It would prevent the lip of the orange from folding inward."
2,"Poor fit, leaves unsqueezed pulp","Poor engineering. There is too much open area between the two halves of the device. This is especially a problem when squeezing thin-skinned Valencia oranges. I have to place an already-squeezed half in with the unsqueezed half to take up some of the space. Even doing this, it still leaves a ring of unsqueezed pulp around the edges of the orange half. Not as effective as the cheap Mexican squeezer that it replaced."
2,"does the job, but not so well",It definitely does NOT get anywhere near all the juice out of an orange. The inside part that does the actual pressing is too small. I squeezed until the handles touched - in other words the world's strongest man couldn't have done any more - and there was juicy orange still left in the rind. These were what I would call medium-sized oranges.
3,Meh...,The juicer's a bit small considering the size of oranges that they're putting on the shelves these days. If you do find an orange that will fit you'll probably notice that there is a lot of pulp (juice) that is left behind. I guess this is OK for a quick `add a squeeze of orange juice to the recipe' but I wouldn't use it for any serious juicing; it's just not that kind of device.
3,Okay For The Price,"This Squeezer is on the flimsy side and is of mediocre construction. It works, but I do not it last for many years. Eh, you get what you pay for. I used to be able to find these squeezer in Latino markets; they were made in Central America or Mexico, were cheap and very durable. Now I guess I'll buy more expensive models made of steel that will last."
1,Leaves a lot to be desired,Seems not all the juice comes out as you would expect. If I cut a hole in the bottom of the orange half it helps to get the juice out.
4,Great little squeezer,"Great little tool, just make sure it is being used the right way. Happy I got the largest one, works on limes and lemons too!"
4,"Amco Enameled Aluminum Squeezer, Orange",I have been using the yellow lemon squeezer for years with lemons and limes. I bought an orange squeezer as well to accommodate larger orange halves. The product accomplishes what it promises but be aware that the squeezed orange juice will be essentially without pulp and therefore only a small quantity can be extracted from any one orange.
5,The Best,"We have many juicers from manual to electric from small to huge. Nothing works better and easier than this. We have the green for limes and the yellow for lemons. We have been looking for the orange for oranges as a replacement . They are impossible to find. Our old one still works great, but the orange color is coming off after a year of daily use. Thanks, Amazon. We bought two!"
2,Less enlightening than other works,"Though Goldsmith's major teaching was beyond words and thoughts, this book again seems to be heavily edited to the point were much of the consciousness has been diluted"
2,VERY LOW LIGHT,"I BOUGHT THIS TO ILUMINATE SOME TREES FROM DOWNSIDE, BUT THE LIGHTS DON'T ILUMINATE NOTHING. VERY POOR LIGHTING."
2,not what I was expecting,These earrings are so small they're completely unnoticable unless the light hits them. The swing wildly even if you're barely moving. More of a nuisance than I was hoping for... I was looking more for an elegant earring to wear in a professional setting.
2,The surprise!,The surprise!It is very small compared to the image ... I wish the Amazon attach jewelry sizes with the information and thank you ..
2,"I am so sorry to tell you this, but I don't think it is the 14K","I have skin problem with the imitation or low karat gold, that is why I ordered 14K.But wearing this earing cause the skin irritation.Never order this one whoever has picky skin like mine.14k Yellow Gold Smoky Quartz Briolette Dangle Earrings"
5,Psalter for Christian Worship,A very useful book if your church likes to sing psalms during worship. This book will help with words and appropriate tune settings. Our former music director used it extensively.
4,Metrical versions of the Psalms,"This book provides the texts for singing the psalter to familar tunes. The versification is conservative, retaining the 2nd person familar ""thy"", ""thou"" of the best-loved English translations. The result is familar but not forced verses that scan easily into familar tunes. Indexes include suggested hymn tunes and liturgical use (calendar).There is a brief introduction giving the history of the reformation Psalters within the Church of Scotland context. This is so brief that it has little value and, in fact, detracts from the book by demonstrating the author's lack of knowledge in regards to the plain song tradition of the psalter. Nonetheless, this is a resource will worth having for anyone with need to use psalms in prayer or song."
2,Lacking real Latin American feel,"Especially the Le Grande Tango is totally lacking in the feel of the tango. It is played too straight forward, missing important nuances in the music that give it the sultry Latin American feel. They should go listen to the Anderson/Roe piano duo or a Yo Yo Ma recording of this to hear how a Piazzolla tango should be played."
1,Crap,I paid for this book on tape and never even got it in the mail. I will never order anything from this site again
3,"Interesting subject matter, but somewhat evasive with info.","Although I really enjoyed this book, I felt that much of the information she presented was alluded to and not explained to the reader. This left me bothered. I wanted a braver approach to the material that she tackles. Metaphysical or Spiritual books lack in effectiveness when the author is the only one experiencing the revelations. I didn't feel I was given a clear opportunity to relate. I was hoping for some more profound insights...the 'aha' to come. This was the first book that I have read by Mary Summer Rain, and it is one of her earliest works. I would be interested to read one of her more recent publications, since her subject matter is so interesting, and I enjoy her straight-forward style of writing."
5,great,excellent product for people with colitis. has help me get off the medication. will recommended need to buy more soon :-)
3,"More of an essay than a book, good though.","I read through this one in about half an hour, it's QUITE short. 53 pages for the hardcover, 64 for the paperback. Presents some good ideas, but the ideas need expanding upon."
3,Ecotheologists only,"Combining the traditionally conservative issue of religion with the traditionally liberal issue of protecting the environment is a difficult task. Land does it well in this book and provides an introduction for those interested in protecting the environment from a Christian standpoint. However, this book is not for those who are not already interested in ecotheology. The information and insight is helpful and thought provoking, but it is not entertaining. Some background in environmental issues is also a prerequiste. If you enjoyed Richard Austin's series on ecotheology, this text is a good follow up."
1,OMG this cheesy,"I love Joan Jett! But this movie is hideous, cheesy and just stupid. Ugh, where are these reviews coming from. Do not waste your time!"
3,Quirky little movie,Not the best movie I have ever seen but if you are a Joan Jett fan it's a must see! For me she was really the highlight of this movie. The outtakes and the bridesmaid's dress were worth the price of the dvd!
4,"Overall, it's great...","When I bought CrashGuard for about $10 at my local office supply store (I have CrashGuard 3), it seemed like a good deal. It works great -- it gives me a minute or so to save my documents before they crash for good. But...I was suprised at what came with CrashGuard. A virus checker? A shortcut verifier? A disk defragmenter? (And lots of other cool extras too!) My computer works much better now...and not to mention the great free subscription to Norton Web Services. LiveUpdate Pro detects programs like Internet Explorer, Office, Windows, and even games like RollerCoaster Tycoon and SimCity 3000! It finds updates for these programs and security patches. Of course, there is one gripe I have with it... CrashGuard seems to crash itself more than all the other programs I have...itsn't that ironic? But the cool extras (the FAST disk defragmenter, virus scanner, registry scanner, etc...) make it a good buy. If only it wouldn't crash itself.So,it gets an overall ""4""..."
3,Why buy it alone?,"Norton System Works 2000 has this along with Ghost 2000, Antivirus 2000, Utilities 2000 and Cleansweep for just a few dollars more. Get it all. It's one of the best software packages out there."
5,Nice watch!,"Bought this for my husband a few years ago and he still wears it nearly everyday. Goes with everything and only had to replace the battery once! Nice, average size for a watch - not too big at all."
4,You can never get enough!!!,"Patch Adam's life was portrayed by Robin Williams on the Hollywood Movie with the same name. Nevertheless, Patch Adam's life isn't just what you see in the movie, actually it is much more interesting and valuable when you read the true insights of this now-famous doctor.Patch proposes a new way to treat diseases, by treating the persons. Humor, fun, magic tricks, sunsets, animals, or whatever is needed to make a person feel better and forget about his/her pain; is his philosophy.The book describes the road Patch has taken to fullfill his dream, and the goals he has fixed for himself and his team. Working to give free, highest quality medicine is not an easy job. Still Patch smiles with his red nose, clownish hair, and funny clothes. You can never get enough about Patch, he is inspiring, funny, and intelligent. Surely this book will make you rethink lots of concepts and ideas. Great Book!!!"
2,Not what the synopsis says it is!,"Except for a brief introduction, this is not the ""hilarious story of Patch Adams"" as the synopsis says. It is a long commentary on the benefits of communal living and of caring medical treatment. How many ways can you say ""care about your patients""? I found it repetative uninteresting after a short time. **** This is my second submittal. Are you going to post it?? ****"
5,Great Album... fantastic band!,"RAM have become one of my favorite bands. They are definitely a classic NWOBHM kind of band. Definitely in the style of Saxon but with Geddy Lee-ish vocals. This album in particular is awesome. The album opens with the awesome ""Sudden Impact"" which will have you singing along ""Wrath Unleashed!"" Best tracks: Sudden Impact, Machine Invaders, Sea of Skulls and the very catchy Breaking Through. If you are a true metal head, you will dig this album."
3,Needs more work,"This book was ok but not great. It read like a good intro book for the main charters that should be continued in a series. The book was long on the charters history and short on adventure. The whole half-elf ""outsider---not an elf and not a human"" thing was played up but more could have been done. If you're a new reader to fantasy adventure this was not your book. The mixing of ""elf language"" and English did not work well. It tended to confuse the reader. This book is for more for the advanced fantasy reader and not the fantasy101 type. A little more explanation of what spell do and the types, and what the creatures were would have helped the book with out making it too simple."
2,A rehash of others work,"Although this is useful as a 'all under one roof' type book, I found some of the material both old and dated, and near verbatim copies of others. The exercises (with very little explaination on chakra breathing) merit the move from 1 star to 2. This was a rushed job, based on others work, and would recommend you save your money."
5,"The ""bible"" of the chakra system","Everything you ever wanted to know about the chakra system but were afraid to ask :-) Incredibly detailed, comprehensive, thorough, deep, useful, practical, and *interesting*. It's the best!"
5,A complete and comprehensive study of the Chakras,"This book has everything you will ever need to know about the Chakra System. The author takes you step by step through the Chakras, explaining them in detail, their colortheir sound, their meaning, the parts of the body they represent, possible malfunctions and remedies as well as exercises. A work well done! Gail Fo"
4,error on page 190,There is an error on page 190 stating that the seed sound is Lam and on page 257 stating it is Yam or Sam...I know from other texts and studies that page 257 is correct. Thank you.
4,Good all around directions to life,"I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in chakra or ""alternative"" spirituality. I would have given it 4 and a half stars but it wouldn't let me. She goes into a lot of detail in this book but sometimes she leaves you wanting more which prevented me from going the full 5 stars. Still, if that's the worst I can say...Wheels also has a lot of yoga and meditations in it so I think that I'm going to be referring to the book long after I'm done."
3,Very heady...,"If you're not ready to get swallowed up in the heavy and sometimes overwhelming dialogue, then it's the book for you. I wish it were just a little simpler to read and digest."
3,Odd Book,Bought this because I'm a huge fan of Elizabeth Montgomery...But this book just stays out in leftfield...The trip about her ghost visiting him in a restaurant after Her death is just too out there for even the most open minded and Spiritual...For hard core Elizabeth Montgomery fans only!
2,Over the Top,"This book reads like it was written by a dizzy queen with an overwrought imagination who is off her meds. I was also disappointed that, if he really had access to Elizabeth Montgomery's spirit (and was not just exploiting his connection to her) he did not ask her what it was like on the Other Side, what the rest of the cast of Bewitched was up to. We would love to know what Endora, Uncle Arthur, and Aunt Clara were up to now. He also should have asked Liz about how gay people were treated on the Other Side, and asked her when a cure for AIDS would be forthcoming. Instead, like most fictional books of this ilk, he wastes time on frothy, silly adventures."
4,Thought provoking and amusing!,This book will run you through so many emotions and yet still it can keep you feeling upbeat hopeful. Lots of great insights into ourselves and how we perceive reality.
1,Steve Madden Kizmit ballet not quality,"This shoe is probably the most poorly made shoe I have ever purchased. The first time I wore them out to the movies and when I came home I noticed one of the jewels on the toe was missing. I had bought them to wear to a wedding so I sent them back and got another pair. I should have known that if they didn't hold up going to the movies, they were definitely not going to hold up dancing at a wedding. At the end of the night, 75% of the jewels were missing from the toe. I do not reccommend this product."
1,Bad experience!!,I never received this item. When I contacted Macys about never receiving it they asked me if I still wanted the item and said they would reship it. Then they never re-shipped but issued a refund for the item instead but did not refund me the shipping which was $8.95! I am still trying to get my shipping refunded to me. I was extremely disappointed with this purchase!
2,Mr. Christmas Winter Wonderland -- Ski Jump,"I have other Mr. Christmas animated items, so when I purchased the last two prior to the Christmas holiday for use with my rather extensive Christmas train layout, I was disappointed that the scale of the two products were different than my previous Mr. Christmas items. There was no mention of the scale with reference to the skiers/lodging, etc., which is important to train enthusiast. The products work well, it is only the scale (sizing) that I am totally disappointed."
4,What I asked for,"I wanted used books and that's what I got. Some books I've received are used but you could never tell. this one however had a big used sticker on the side, but whatever, I don't use it for my class much."
2,Interesting but light on facts...,"If your interested in knowing a little bit about this man, I'd recommend one of the many biographies. Rubenstein's book doesn't unveil any secrets or shed any light on the unknown. We all know he's completely dedicated to his cause and manipulative..what successful politician isn't? The book is filled with second and third hand accounts and sometimes even unconfirmed rumor."
4,Delightful. 4.7 stars.,"This is the first time I've read Connie Lane; I immediately sought out ""The Viscount's Bawdy Bargain"" too.The heroine & hero are both superbly drawn and enchanting. Their chemistry is apparent, and their relationship marvelous. Lynnette is bold and crafty (in a good way). Ravensfield is intelligent and has a way with words. The bits of suspense add just the right touch to the romance. Delicious reading."
5,Falcon Crest Season 1,"Finally Falcon Crest comes to DVD....On May 5th the First Season will be released in Germany. I hope that the other eight Seasons will be released soon, too."
5,Falcon Crest,"I think Falcon Crest was one of the best night time tv-series in the 1980's.Angela Channing, Melissa and Richard were amazing characters on the show.I hope it comes out soon on DVD like Dynasty and Dallas."
5,Why no DVD release?,"Come on Warners, bring FALCON CREST out on DVD. One of the best shows of the 1980's, with a superbly droll central performance from Jane Wyman as Angela Channing, matriarch of Californian wine country, complimented by a great cast (Susan Sullivan, David Selby, Robert Foxworth, Lorenzo Lamas, Ana Alicia, Billy Moses, Margaret Ladd), fantastic guest stars (Lana Turner, Gina Lollobrigida, Robert Stack, Cesar Romero, Kim Novak, Leslie Caron, Ursula Andress), beautiful location filming in the Napa valley and OTT storylines - plane crashes, earthquakes, fires, Nazis, gangsters.FALCON CREST was the perfect halfway house between the rivals DALLAS and DYNASTY - more glamorous than the former yet not as camp as the latter.Come on Warners, don't let this quality show gather dust in your vault, release the first season on DVD in 2007!!I would happily purchase all nine seasons."
5,Like fine wine it ages well,"How fun to watch Falcon Crest again! Jane Wyman has her character, Angela, down pat from the very beginning.... the woman you love to hate. A scheming, conniving um... witch. Greatly enjoyed watching the 1st season again. So, when are the rest of the seasons being released??"
5,FALCON CREST IN THE USA FINALLY!,I am so thrilled I finally got season 1 of Falcon Crest. I never thought they would release it in the USA. Keep the seasons coming! I love it! BRAVO!
5,Just found out that Knots Landing is coming to DVD ... WHERE'S FALCON CREST?!?,"Why won't the studio release this show? The acting was terrific, the writing was clever and Falcon Crest had a sense of humor about itself that no other primetime soap had. Come on! Release it already!! PLEASE??? :-)"
5,Ditto all of the above!!!,"A blast from the past- I used to watch this religiously every Friday night after Dallas back in the 80s!!! I, too, don't understand why this is not yet out on DVD yet!"
5,FED UP WITH WAITING FOR THIS DVD RELEASE,"My God! This has to be the only title that I keep checking on that has yet been released. They don't even have a 2nd Knots Landing out. Are they slow, cheap, or greedy? What is taking so damn long. I've been waiting since the earlier part of this decade and century for that matter. Let's get the show on the road, folks!"
5,Please release Falcon Crest on DVD,"I grew up watching Falcon Crest. Over all these years, I think it's the best show ever!! I taped all the seasons when they were on the soap network...but I still want the DVD's. I think a lot of people would buy them...especially if they added a few small extras. I would definitely buy them all!! And I think a lot of other people would too."
1,Falcon Crest Season 2,"Well let me tell you Warner Bros really did the worst job releasing Season Two of Falcon Crest for $52.00 that can only be purchased from the WB website.... there is no episode guide no nothing a plastic case with 6 disk the outside cover and the transfer wasen't even cleaned up and worst of all there are no subtitles.....I just bought the complete mini series ""Rich Man Poor Man "" released by A&E company beautifully packaged all nine disk including the episode guide and previews before and after each episode..The transfer was beautifully done and I bought it on Amazon ...Shame on Warner Bro's. for how they treated all of us Knots Landing fans (Still Holding Us Hostage ) by not releasing the rest of the series and we know how those releases went and now with Falcon Crest but they will release the crap of today's reality shows which will never have the substance of days gone by purchase at your own risk but if your looking for the glory days you will be sorely disappointed"
3,childhood memories,I remembered this series. And it brought back memories after family dinners.But I wonder what did I ever see in this series. It is vicious family ties.
5,Falcon Crest,"Falcon Crest was one of your best night time soaps. If you liked Knots Landing or Dallas,you will like Falcon Crest."
1,Eagle M83 Battery Pack was Bogus,"Product did not fit, not in any way, shape, or form. Ad was misleading and bogus, or at least not enough information was provided I now realize. Wrote it off and moved on."
1,Disappointing,I found this book to be extremely misleading and disappointing. Mary Summer Rain needs to understand that just because a spirit says it's angelic doesn't mean it is. I found these messages to be more demonically based than angelic. So sad.
4,"pretty nice, maybe the best","Well, fairly impressed, small, after filling it, hanging it up and letting her rip, had a constant stream for close to 5 minutes, pretty decent. As another reviewer noted, the outlet hose is kinked at the junction with the bag, looks like at manufacturing, they just folded the hose over to make the 90 degree angle, and decided to live with the kink. Good news is that is seems able to handle it, so I don't expect it to fail, but a little heat and a slightly better manufacturing process could have avoided that, but probably would have raised the price. Also the clocking on the outlet hose is not as pictured, mine runs down and to the right, but they were smart enough to put a velcro loop on both sides, presumably to accommodate that, but again there seems no consistency in manufacturing. Otherwise it works great, has a thermometer on the back of it, when the outlet is closed it doesn't leak, I am very pleased with it."
2,water did not heat up,"i bought this camp shower for a week long canoe trip to the boundary waters. The shower worked great, but the water never heated up despite being in partial sun all day. Maybe it will work great if in full sun, but you cant predict the weather. i ended up boiling water and adding it to the bag and that worked good."
1,Dont Buy from these people,"The product arrived on time. Since I needed this item for a camping trip I tried to follow up for shipping information with the manufacturer on repeated occasions and did not receive a reply. The item was received with a permanently crimped water tube due to poor packaging. Since I had to take it on a trip to Canada I could not return it, so I patched it with tubing and duct tape. I would never buy from this manufacturer again."
5,Great product,"We have three of these, and are ordering more. They are small enough to pick up and move easily. The five gallon ones are too heavy when full for me to handle easily.We have used these exclusively for our hot water usage - all last summer, and now starting a second season. I use them for everything - showering, dishes, clothes, everything. Daily, regular use.One is plenty for a shower, and if I want to shampoo as well, I simply use a second one.We did have one that got a hole in it, but we taped it and it's fine now. And we have one that has started to split on the side - the back pulling away from the main part of the reservoir, but not in such a way that it's leaking. We have learned to keep a large thin cloth spread out on the deck, so that when we lay these in the sun, they are resting on cloth, to help extend their useful lives.This is a very economical way to experiment with solar water heating."
2,dated,"2 great shows but they are technically dated. They may look good on a 26"" tv but on a big screen they are pretty poor.Also I didn't care for the editing, seems like the editor/director were on meth, incessantly fast cutting. I will wait for a hopeful remastering for bluray, although I'm sure it won't be re-edited. For dedicated fans only, or casual fans with small screens."
5,Fantastic,Great item. Tina is the best. I never saw her in concert but this is the next best thing. I have watched it almost every week since I received it.
2,"Although interesting, the book fails to make ActiveX clear.","I have worked a little bit with ActiveX, but I was looking for a book that would clearly explain the different elements of ActiveX programming. Unfortunately, this book does not do that. The examples rely so heavily on the wizards that most of the code is written automaically. It then explains almost none of the code. Thus, after reading this book, it would still be difficult to do ActiveX development because, you wouldn't know what all the code was for. The first chapter is particularly poor. It is a review of Visual Basic which is pointless if you know VB, and way too short to be useful if you don't know VB. If you want a book to supplement other books on ActiveX, this is an okay choice. But, I would not reccomend it as a primary source to learn ActiveX."
5,A Great How-To Video Even for Experienced Photographers,"I've been photographing for a long time, and have perhaps become a bit smug about certain subject matter. Take waterfalls, for example. ""I know how to photograph those!"" Well, I don't. The tips in this DVD proved that.There are many other great tips in this DVD, meaning I'll need to watch it several times to take them all in.I recommend this DVD to anyone considering a photo trip to Yellowstone National Park, even for advanced photographers. Aside from the fine content, this DVD is professionally produced. In fact, the tips presented have broad applicability beyond Yellowstone. You won't be sorry buying this one."
1,Miss Manners would be horrified,"This is not a guide, it's a collection of wedding horror stories other people have submitted to the author's website. You can read those stories for free.The author's attempt at wit falls far short of the mark...she comes across as a mean-spirited boor. For real wedding advice, pick up Peggy Post's updated edition of Emily Post's Wedding Etiquette instead."
5,LILAC,"I LOVE THIS BOOK. IT IS A GREAT READ AND JANICE HARREL IS A GREAT WRITER, IF YOU REALLY LIKE THIS BOOK YOU SHOULD READ BOOK ONE AND THREE AND FOUR I'M SURE YOU'LL LOVE THEM HEAPS AND READ THEM MORE THAN ONCE...."
3,Pubescent fun,I am not sure if it's an early book by this author -- it does not read well in some places (I wonder if his writing has improved since). It is also for somewhat younger readers (15-20 maybe)-- it is hard to take it seriously if you are older than that. Great description of the 60s in Toronto -- free love and what not (including descriptions of la vida loca in Rochdale).
3,2 reworked short stories,"The first story is ""Barbed Wire"", about a cowboy taking over a homestead that he has won in a poker game and a cold hearted big rancher that wants to run the cowboy and the other homesteaders off of his range by any means possible, this story has two pages with several illegible lines due to very a very poor printing process by Leisure Books. The 2nd story is the title ""Claiming of the Deerfoot"" about Ed Thorne a stage driver extraordinaire being falsely accused of robbing his own stage and murdering his shotgun guard. The original titles of these were respectivly ""Partner Get Your Gun"" from a 1939 Western Magazine, and ""Trailblazer Wanted For Drive Thru Hell"", from a 1942 Western Magazine, they're not bad stories but not up to Peter Dawson's later full length novels."
2,Inefficiency,"We ordered the box of candy for an anniversary gift along with a separate order of flowers. The flowers arrived in a timely fashion but the candy arrived 6 days later. When they arrived they were completely melted and had reformed in the box. The recipient called to say what had happened. A replacement box was sent a week later. We don't know who to blame for the delay in shipping or for the manner in which it was shipped. If you would like to discuss this matter further, please call me at 888.671.6402.Sincerely,Janet Mack Zaloga"
3,Good if you are at a California airport,"These chocolates are good, not phenomenal. If you're at an airport in California, and you forgot to bring your friends a gift, these make for a delightful present. One word of advice--if you like nuts and chews, consider getting the strictly nuts and chews box in lieu of this variety chocolate assortment. They won't be as refined as Teuscher or Godiva, but they will be very satisfying in a down-home American way!!"
2,"Good stuff, prohibitive shipping",Chocolates are great. Shipping costs are high. They took close to a week to actually ship the chocolates.
1,Shipping is crazy,"$13.95 in shipping (5-7 days) for a $26.00 order!?!?!? Do the math, that's OVER 50% extra on shipping alone. Are you crazy? We're not talking about Scharffen Berger chocolates here and they only charge $9 for 3 to 5 days (for a $30 order). I don't care what chocolate you buy, but don't get taken on the shipping for a cheap product!!!"
2,Ho hum,"Nothing particulary outstanding about this chocolate, it's good but the extremely high shipping/handling costs not worth it."
1,Junk,"This is a junky, cheap looking piece of c..... The only thing it would be good for is the trash. It looks like something you would get out of a bubble gum maching."
5,Dainty,"My daughter gave this to me for my birthday, among other items. I love pink and especially rose quartz. This bracelet is very feminine. The beads are tiny, but that's part of the charm of this bracelet, in my opinion. I tried pulling it apart, thinking I may have to re-string it, but it's solid and would not break. I pulled it very hard. I highly recommend this darling bracelet. It's perfect for small, petite wrists !!!"
3,A Labor of Love,"This book is a great source for information on the chapterplays of the silent era onward. There are some interesting factoids, such as how Kirk Alyn(Superman) and Lyle Talbot(Lex Luthor) would trade recipes on the set. Alyn later became a food writer for a local paper. I wanted more of this behind the scenes information and less rehashing of the serial plots. Nevertheless, the author's love of his subject is clear and he pays great respect to the comic books from which many of these serials were born. Batman in particular sounds like a racist travesty, with the actor playing Robin sporting a visible tattoo and Batman's gut hanging over his belt. Captain America also got the sore treatment, Cap was given a gun instead of shield. Interesting book on a long lost subject."
4,The Punisher / Punisher: War Zone (Two-Pack) [Blu-ray],It's a grat couple of movies is fuul in accion and I love the caracters of Marvel comics yo nedd to have it
5,You feel like you're there.,"Well done technically--balanced content. A visit/exploration to several Tibetan nunneries by a group of western women. Honest, touching (beautiful footage)--the author/editor summarized the nunneries recent history of Chinese destruction and reflourishing. They captured the devotion and sweetness of the nuns without sugar-coating the lifestyle. If you want to simplify your life for spiritual development, this is inspirational support. A worthy cousin to Amongst the Clouds."
5,A fact lover's dream,"This book is a must for anyone who enjoys knowing all the details about the world. Everything and anything that you could could ever want to know about countries or international organizations is here, from key points in the history of a country to how many tons of wool were exported/imported. This book is well worth it."
4,If you like the Beautiful South ...,"If you're reading this, you must be the other person in the U.S. who is a fan of The Beautiful South. This is the first solo album by Paul Heaton, the main singer/songwriter from TBS. Most of these songs could pass for TBS songs. This is a great pop album. It's wonderfully produced, with a thick sound, layered with a vairety of instrumentation. The melodies are catchy of course, and after a few listens they become addictive. The lyrics are meaty, though you'll probably have to consult the lyric sheet to understand what he's saying a lot of the time. The mood of the lyrics is typical TBS - cynical, clever and fun. The first single, ""Mitch,"" is one of the weaker songs on th album. The best tracks are The Perfect Couple, Man's World, and Poems ..."
4,"Paul Heaton, minus the B.S.","Well, we always suspected that The Beautiful South WAS Paul Heaton. I have been waiting 12 long years for a solo effort from him, so I guess this album is a wish come true.Paul Heaton has always been outstanding on two levels: his lyrics and his vocals. He is half-present on this album.Cynicism is there (and welcomed) as always (""the difference between the junkie and me...I always failed successfully""). Rumor has it, Heaton's off the sauce, and I was afraid it would affect his typically brilliant lyrics (is that selfish?). Fortunately it hasn't. Melodies are damn catchy as well.Unfortunately, Heaton seems to have forgotten that he can sing. I first listened through the cd, skipping from one song to the next, straining to hear SOMETHING -- some trace of his powerful, ethereal vocals (ala ""Lean on Me"" / ""Let Love Speak Up Itself""). No evidence of it on this record, though. Very disappointing.Overall, thumbs up. An obvious must for any Housemartins/BS fan."
4,Telescopic neck ...key feature!,"The telescopic neck was its key selling feature for me. The Conair Deluxe Lighted Makeup Mirror offers the ability to adjust to various heights. After all, not everyone is the same height or uses the same chair to sit in to apply their makeup. Ever have to crouch down to see in the mirror or stack books under the mirror to bring it up to your eye level? If you have, then you know what I mean. This makeup mirror provides adequate lighting and magnification along with a real bonus....the telescopic neck....adding comfort in application to its list of features."
3,Lovely to look at but not bright enough,"This is a very attractive lighted mirror. Looks-wise, it's perfect. However, if you need a bright light to apply your makeup or for tweezing, it's not bright enough. The size of the mirror is terrific, but as I already own a non-lighted 3x magnification mirror, the Conair, which is supposed to be 3x is not as powerful as the one I already have. I really would have preferred 5x, but was willing to go with the one I ordered because of the look and the light. I was disappointed with it."
5,Outstanding,"Escape Fire is collection of compelling speeches by one of America's leading crusaders for health care quality and patient safety - Don Berwick, MD, founder and president of the Boston-based Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI.org).Each year, IHI hosts the National Forum on Quality Improvement in Health Care. The influential annual event draws 4,000 health care leaders from around the world in person and 6,000 via satellite. In many ways, Dr. Berwick's keynote lectures set the tone for quality improvement efforts across the US. With an effective blend of common sense, real-life stories, persuasive metaphors, and out-of-the-box thinking, Dr. Berwick's presentations make for fascinating reading for anyone interested in improving America's $1.7 trillion health care system."
1,Looks like a serviceable part.,Bought this item to upgrade the cord for my coach but to my surprise I found this item useless.It looks like the right item when buying it but most importantly it does not have and place to screw the electrical plug into it.If you ever plugged it into a camper and tried to unplug it the plug would stay plugged in and the yellow housing would slide back on the cable.This item seems dangerous to me as if the housing slid back while it was plugged in you could be shocked.Had to buy another one from a camper dealer with the holes on the inside to accept the screws to hold the electrical plug in place.(note) BUYER BEWARE!
2,not an authorized dealer,the watch is beautiful and works great but I found out that amazon is not an authorized dealer and therefore you don't get the lifetime service guarantee from tag heuer. probably should have purchased from somewhere else.
2,Tag Heuer...I expected more,"I bought this watch so I had a dress watch for work, received it and was not impressed. It was small and seemed very flimsy for the price that I paid. I sent it back and bought a much nicer watch and I am very happy. May work for some folks, just not for me."
5,A glimpse of the past,"This book is great! Has wonderful old time recipes from an old cookbook from the 1700s along with great pictures and articles about life as it was then. If you like history and old cookie recipes, this book is the one. It will probably bring back memories of your grandma's cooking and home life from your childhood if you are my age!! Very enjoyable and referred to often in my kitchen. You won't regret your purchase. Great addition to any cookbook collector's stockpile."
1,"nice game, mic is JUNK!","Well, the kids have enjoyed a LOT. Too bad the microphone is a complete piece of junk (which is the reason for 1 star). The wire(s) are loose inside of it and it either won't work at all or scratches horribly. We've only had it since September. Recommendation - avoid.Update 2008-05: Have since contacted Logitech (maker of the microphone) by phone, and email several times. Was promised a no-cost replacement mic. It took some time and multiple follow up emails & phone calls to finally recieve it 3 mos after the initial contact."
1,"Fun game, but had to waste money on extra microphone","Sony should be ashamed of themselves! One would think that a PS2 game should be compatible to the PS2 SingStar microphones which are toted as the ""official"" microphones for PS2 karaoke games! I popped this game in and it didn't even recognize the SingStar microphone! And since the box never even told me that this was the case, I didn't realize I had to get another microphone in order to play this game. What a waste of money, and now I'm stuck with another microphone, which, BTW, doesn't work with SingStar karaoke titles on PS2. What's the deal with that? If a microphone is made for PS2, it should work with all PS2 karaoke games, should it not? I'm sure I'm not the only one to have a problem with this blatent ripping off of customers. So I had to purchase another microphone which was compatible with this game. Other than that, the game is actually pretty fun."
5,fun for the whole family,"Finding time to spend with the family has never been so much fun. My Daughter, Husband, and myself are all terrible singers who love to think we can sing. Playing this is a real hoot. We all laughed so hard and had so much fun, it was like being on our favorite show, without the public humiliation. It's a great way to get friends and family together, and enjoy each others company, while laughing the whole time."
4,Fun for All Ages,"This game is fun for all ages. I have played it with my grandsons ages 6 and 10, and with my daughters 25 and 35. Needless to say, I'm over 60 and still enjoy it. It is not necessary to be a big fan of the show and it's not really necessary to be a great singer. The game provides you with a good array of songs and provides the lyrics and melody, so all you have to do is sing along. Several levels of ""hardness"" keep it challenging and as you progress, you can unlock some new songs and extra items like clothing for your character and videos of actual contestants singing the songs in the game. It can be used by multiple players for a contest, or by a single person just for fun and relaxation. We'd all recommend it."
3,The Cat's Purrspective,"Nice game, with good graphics. The song selection is not that good, and the comments by the judges get rather stale, but over all it's a great addition to the Karaoke Revolution line."
2,mediocre book on a great subject,"I'm glad that another lesbian & gay black anthology exists, but I wasn't particularly impressed with this book. I thought Hemphill's ""Brother to Brother"" and even ""Afrekete"" were much better books. Maybe due to the Canadian-British-diasporic scope, this book dealt with blacks in far whiter milieux and seemed a tad white-washed. Notice how the book has ""queer"" in the title when almost no African-American gay text does. I think the editors did not have much vision with this collection either. It's not terrible, but it could have been better."
3,Classic Hootie with clear view of the Future...,"From the opening chord of ""Fine Line"" any listener can hear this is classic/pop rock at its finest. Choosing covers they built a career on, Hootie pulls the radio friendly pop of ""Cracked Rear View,"" the maturity of ""Fairweather Johnson,"" and the style of ""Musical Chairs"" and throw it into a great album. Darius Rucker continues to become one of the best rock & roll singers today - a big, gutsy, R&B-tinged baritone. Highlights include Bill Wither's ""Use Me"" and Kim Richey's ""Let Me Be Your Man."" Who cares if its not 'cool' to like Hootie - go to your local record store now, pick up this record and take a long road trip with the windows down. You won't regret it..."
4,H&B grow on you...,"While cracked rear view can never be match, every album since has been surprisingly enjoyable to listen to. Darius Rucker puts such feeling into his songs. I can't stop listening to his warm base voice. This album is as good as any previous one. They really sound good with the ""Use Me"" remake. I hope it hits the radio!"
4,Hooked again on Hootie,"and their latest record. For anyone on the fence about whether or not to get this album should hop on down and get to their local record store (or on-line, it's cheaper) and pick up ""scattered, smothered, and covered"". Listening to this album is like being in on a private jam session with the band, much like it was during a Hootie show in the early days. The sound is very lose and their renditions of these ""covers"" are completely new and original. The liner notes (I'm betting where written by Mark) are smart and helpful in disecting the songs as you listen. My faves on the album are: Let Me Be Your Man, I'm Over You, Gravity Of the Situation, and Use Me. Too bad their first ever recording ""I Don't Understand"" never made to a pressed cd. One day. Keep doing what your doing fellas."
4,Great Rarities,"An album that at first appears somewhat more eclectic than your average Hootie album. After a time of listening to it, the disparate styles of music, which cross from full-on bouncy pop (Araby) to mellow classics (Hey Hey What Can I Do?) to country (Fine Line) to golden oldies (Dream Baby), seem somewhat helter skelter in their scattering throughout this album. Yet after a while, the album seems to pick up a flow that almost begins to make complete sense. Sure, the styling is somewhat random, but the musical quality of the tracks selected, including a soulful live cut (I Hope I don't Fall in Love With You) allows the listener to enjoy the fullest range of Hootie's distinctive and easily identifiable sound. I am purchasing this album for a second time, since continuous play of the first copy left it so badly scratched that I am forced to purchase a second copy to make up for the unplayability of the first. I rate this album as perhaps the very best of all of Hootie's albums."
4,Fully Covered?,"This new album from Hootie and the boys is definatley worth a look for anybody who appreciates good songs. There is something for everyone ranging form brilliant rock songs like Fine Line to soppy love songs like Renaissane Eyes. The album makes a tremendous start with the first four songs but doesn't really hold my attention as much as Cracked Rear View. But don't let this put you off, Well worth 15 or the dollar equivalent."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS LAST,"THIS IS A CD THAT`S MADE UP OF COVERS SONGS.IT`S NOT A BAD CD BUT IT`S NOT GREAT EITHER.IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE THE LAST CD WAS SO GOOD THAT THIS ONE DOESN`T STAND UP WELL TO IT.THE VOCALS ON THIS ARE GREAT,BUT IT JUST ISN`T AS GOOD AS THERE 3 OTHER CD`S.BUT I BELIEVE THAT ANYTHING WITH DARIUS RUCKER ON VOCALS IS WORTH GETTING.BEST SONGS ON THIS ARE I HOPE THAT I DON`T FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU,I GO BLIND AND THE LED ZEPPELIN REMAKE HEY HEY WHAT CAN I DO.THIS IS WORTH GETTING BUT DON`T EXPECT A MUSICAL CHAIRS."
5,Does just what it says it does,I use this unit to create some 'action' in our 'on deck plunge pool'Works great! Lot's better than the other Conair types with two outputs or the ones that run without power cords (they just don't seem to run very long before needing recharging)
1,Not Your Mother's Magnalite!,"I own five pieces of this cookware branded Magnalite. Four pieces were my mother's. She had them for over thirty years. They were made and marked by General Housewares Corp (GHC), an Indiana company, at their plant in Sidney, Ohio. The fifth piece was made there too but not by GHC and that's the problem. GHC made Magnalite up until 1995 when they sold the name Magnalite and the plant. The fourth piece I own was made in Ohio after 1995 by another company. Though it looks similiar in design, it is measurably half the thickness and weight of my mother's pieces. There is also another company that is using the name Magnalite that is making them in China. Replacement parts for the new Magnalite will not fit the original old pieces. So todays Magnalite is not the same as your mother's. Be advised."
2,Magnalite cookware,"This is not like my mother's original Magnalite Cookware set. Its lighter in weight for sure! Not overly pleased with the set. Not up to the standards of the old Magnalite, in my opinion."
5,The best Cookware set out there!,"Best set I have ever owned. I have always used Magnalite, but I was need of replacements. I highly recommend this item."
5,Cure for rodents,"My husband had suggested to try peppermint because sometimes we have mice in the house. He said that mice don't like the smell so I took cotton balls around where it was. I have heard the mouse since. and if they come back, just put some more out. It is better than dangerous traps, poisons or other means because of pets or humans. I bought three more bottles, which it cheaper than the previous methods."
4,A classy voice that makes you feel good any time of the year.,"On this CD, Lou Rawls is backed by a small Jazz Combo as he sings well-known classic tunes which have seasonal themes. His masterful rendition of Louis Armstrong's ""What A Wonderful World"" truly merits a standing ovation but that only shows you why Lou was always considered a ""singer's singer"" and why many of his peers (including Frank Sinatra) always held him in such high regard. While all of the songs on this CD have Jazz arrangements (i.e., this is NOT a Soul or Pop CD) they are all nonetheless enjoyable and are throwbacks to a simpler time when music was truly food for the heart and soul."
3,Pooped out after 4 years of use,"I use a mixer pretty heavily..bread dough a few times a week and long brioche mixing cycles, in addition to the usual cakes and cookies. This mixer has worked pretty well, but this weekend it burned out on a batch of Massa Souada (portugese sweet bread). It went clunkity clunk and then quit turning on :-(.I really expected to have this mixer for a long time, so I'm a little disappointed"
5,If you get one of these you will soon enjoy cooking!,"I received one of these for Christmas (my first married Christmas) from my mother-in-law. I was happy b/c I figured this would be helpful in making cookies or the occasional cake. I am a full time graduate student and I work full time. I now cook dinner almost every night and try new recipes b/c of my kitchen aid mixer. It can do almost anything. Cream cheese, butter, peanut butter, and all of that other stuff that was a pain to mix up is now a delight. ... ENJOY!"
5,I would like to give this 5+ stars!!,I love this mixer! We got it as a wedding present and I have just gotten around to using it after 5 months. I was real scared at first because I have used hand mixers before and stuff goes everywhere...but this one is awesome! I can't wait to make Christmas cookies!!! I love it!!!
1,picture had all attachments with it,"the picture was showing a hook and paddle attachment, when I got it, it was not there. Then I read in small print only whip attachment with it. I think the picture should have reflected thatI bought because of the dough hook and paddle"
4,Great Product for Infrequent Use,"We bought this mixer seven years ago, and rarely use it. When we do, it has been up to the task. It's heavy, and feels well built overall. I made two batches of cookies tonight with it, and there are just a few things about it that make me worry about it's durability. For one, the speed and lock levers move too easily on the model I have. With little resistance, the levers have a cheap feel. This might be something they all have or perhaps the design changed since then. The motor had just a slight problem going through the dough. It seemed as if it were slightly underpowered in my opinion. Then again, I got this mixer for $120 when Mervyns was going out of business so I don't expect it to perform like the $300 Professional model. I may be nitpicking a little as this mixer has served us well over the years. If I were a frequent user, I'd consider a bigger model with more power. But I'm not a frequent user and this model suits me just fine."
4,very good product,It is a very powerful mixer. I like it.But I have difficult time to remove the mixing bowl after use.
2,Unluckly mine is broken about 2 years of usage,"I typically use this to knead doughs(once per week and 4 cups of flour each time) and it is broken now. So I guess when people say this thing is built for last, they probably use it mainly to mix salad.Then I went through the reviews on different models and many people have pointed out that non professional KitchenAid stand mixers are not intended to knead dough, even though they includes the ""C"" hook.It takes me a while, but I finally figured out how to dissemble this thing and located the broken part(a worm gear). Finding the replacement parts is surpisely easy in the internet(good thing to own a brand name). For ~$30 it went back to work. This time I will be vert careful not to do too much kneading.:-)"
2,"Okay, not terrific.","I have thick black hair, and I didn't notice anything drastic with this shampoo. The shampoo doesn't lather well, and I had to use large portions (too bad this is so expensive)."
3,Essential.,"There are at five tribute albums to Weezer floating out there that I know of. This is the only one worth buying. Unlike some tribute albums (mainly the awful Ramones tribute that was released last winter), this one truly does it's job by having bands that add their own perspective to their favorite weezer songs. While at the same time staying true to the sound that may not be uniquely, but definitely originally Weezer."
1,what's the point of this?,"The artists on this album had a very nice thought when they decided to make a Weezer tribute album. It's a good idea because Weezer is a good band that deserves tribute. In fact, they are more talented than any of the bands on this CD. However, it might still be interesting to hear different interpretations of Weezer's music, even if it comes from a less talented group. You know, even if somebody had done something ridiculous like turn ""Say it Ain't So"" into a rap song, it might've been fun to listen to. But this album presents nothing interesting. All that the bands try to do is imitate Weezer, and nothing comes close to the original. They don't put a new spin on anything, so what's the point? Go buy the Blue album and Pinkerton. Actually, if you're even reading this, you probably already own both anyway. I highly recommend that you just go back and listen to them instead of wasting your time with this."
2,nice try dudes.,weezer fans are some of the most die hard fans i have ever met.this cd seems like it would appeal to like the younger brothers of those fans.. u know.. the guys who grew up around the music and knew the songs but did not really take to the most important thing about weezer- their sound.
1,Did not work.,This remote is garbage. The first one I purchased was with the new tankless water heating unit and lasted less then 4 months before it showed error code 76. This new remote I just purchased on amazon lasted less them a week before it showed error code 76. This code means it has lost it's communication with the unit. The tankless heating unit still runs but I have bypassed the remote unit and will not invest in another remote. Do not waste your money replacing the remote they are just not worth the cash.
5,canon printer,"I enjoy my new printer. I have used it for copies, printing & scanner. It works copying film negitivies."
4,Nice but big,The copy quality is excellent. Seems like the ink that is included with the unit is not as much as the replacement cartridges. It starts reminding you that ink is low everytime even though I have made over 30 good prints since the annoying warning came up. The warning came on after less than 150 average prints. The unit is quite large so make sure you have enough space for it.
2,Sucks ink!,"Convenient for scanning and copying, but absolutely sucks ink. Every other page of printing requires cleaning of the print head. I'm extremely disappointed in the product."
3,Canon MP800 Printer,"I found this product unsatisfactory because I could not use my XD photo card. It required a special insert, which I could not obtain either online or at any computer store. And if I was able to find the special adaptor it would not have been useful for anything except the 156 chip.Addtionally I found the color print quality from prints from the computer to be poor quality. I have a $60 HP that does a better job.For these reasons I found it necessary to return the machine.Thank you for asking my opinion and thanks for your prompt refund. I certainly will not stop using Amazon.C.W. Larcom"
4,w.d,"pros-excellant speed in print and copy-scanning speed of negatives is a little slow, but with excellant results.-sofware package is easy to use for casual user-documents can be saved as pdf filescons-black cover shows dust and scratches-doesn't come with usb cable"
3,Canon pixma,"Not as user friendly as my HP. Before I read the book I tried quickly to scan a file and store it for copying but was lost within a short time.It is really just so, so."
1,Worst machine I have bought in years,"Worked twice, then started flashing alert light, and screen displayed japanese text. Could not get the machine to ever do anything again. $50.00 to send it back, no charge to throw in the dumpster and try a different brand. Wow, Cannon used to be so good. What happened?! Stay away from this one"
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I bought this printer to print photos, the quality was poor. The ink cartridges empty or dry up way too fast. It's on the big side. The scan, copy & print for text are fine."
1,buyer beware,At first I was very pleased with the product. Then within 6 months....I constantly got several error messages regarding the ink cartridges. Very frustrating. I know it's not me. I wouldn't buy again.
4,"Works well, as I expected","Reasonably easy to set up, has performed well in the few weeks I have owned it. Grunts and groans a bit before it does certain things but speed is fine once it gets warmed up."
2,Great prints - poor reliability,"I bought this printer about 4 months ago. The prints are beautiful, and the speed quite good as well. However, I felt compelled to write a review tonight because of the constant error messages that pop up saying that there are too many ink cartridges of ""X"" color installed. It happens now between every print job, forcing me to open the printer, pull out and re-install one to three of the tanks, and then print my document. There is something wrong with this thing, and I don't appear to be the first experiencing it. Figures... I wait eight years to replace my printer, and end up with one that malfunctions! I will attempt to return this item."
5,Awesome machine,Right out of the box this beauty preformed flawlessly. Very easy set-up with comprehensive manual and instructional cd. Print quality is excellent and being able to work with 35mm slides to save and reformat old photos is worth the modest price.Unless you spend some quality time with the PIXMA MP800 you will never realize all the features that it pocesses. It continues to surprise me with operations that it contains.
3,Canon PIXMA MP800 All in One Photo Printer,"The printer has a major flaw for usage in my home. It is not comapatible with wireless print servers. I believe that prospective buyers should be warned about that in advance. Perhaps more savvy consumers realized that not all printers will work this way, but I did not. When I called Canon, they were not helpful, only saying that they did not make this item to be used with a wireless print server.It prints just fine."
5,Amazing quality and lasts years,"I bought this printer in 2005 and it still works to this day, the only problem is that it is not Mac compatible. I had no luck trying to update drivers or anything else to get it to work so I purchased a new MG4120. Huge downgrade in quality, but for just printing black and white and scanning things, it is more cost effective. I will probably connect this to my backup computer so that I can still use the scanner because I don't think I will get the same quality from the 4120, but we will see.My only complaint in 7 years of use was the cost to replace all the cartridges when I really never printed that much in color."
3,DONT COUNT ON REFILLING THE INK ON THIS ONE!,"Good printer, scanner. The only thing is - the ink cartriges are tagged with a chip which will not reset once the ink runs out even if you refill it. Thus, you HAVE to buy original Canon cartriges at premium prices and I do not have to tell you what they cost. I missed this unfortunate ""innovation"" in my research. The absence of any instructions on the refill kits for this particular model should have made me think about it.The printer will reluctantly print but will NOT use refilled ink cartriges resulting in incorrect colors and it will allways show ""ink low"" in the systems window. As of now I can not figure out a way to outsmart this thing."
5,impressive machine,"I've had it for a couple of weeks. I Read the manual and played with the features a bit. It works well, and has good software. Photo printing is dandy. Ultimately, for the price, it's hard to beat.A couple of things that are somewhat disappointing are the speed at which the machine gets started - it's slow to fire off but goes fast when it does. The second part is the 2-sided copying which is not as I expected, but that is hard to tell without looking at a manual before purchasing. It does not print one side of a document then reverse direction and print a second side on the back of the page, which is what I thought it might do. Lastly,it does not automatically turn on when you print from the computer, like most printers I've had before. All in all, it's fine."
5,Excellent product!,"I bought this multifunction printer after a lot of research. I am a scrapbooker and I was going to make my heritage album so I needed something that would scan really old photos, print them, and even scan negatives.I haven't had a chance to scan negatives yet, but I love what the machine can do so far. Printing is quick and sharp. I LOVE the quality of prints and the scanning is very fast.It took me about an hour to set it up. The instructions were so easy and perfect for a non-techie like me.The only con so far is that the shiny black material of the printer gets very dusty. I plan on buying a muslin cloth to cover it so it won't get as dusty when it's not in use."
5,Very good!,I brought a couple packages up to my family and they were gone in a day! My niece and nephew loved them too! I recommend these chocolate chunk cookies to anyone!
3,Chocolate Chunk & Peanut Butter Creme (2 reviews),"It wouldn't accept a separate review or editing of my initial 3 star rating, but I added the Peanut butter cookies.CHOCOLATE CHUNK *** (3 stars)Mine are darker than they appeared on the box, so I also posted a picture. They have plenty of chocolate chunks and a pretty good taste, but another minute in the oven and they would have burnt. They're probably great dipped in milk but I prefer cookies not so crisp...you know, like the ones pictured on the box. This is especially annoying when buying case lots.PEANUT BUTTER CREME ****1/2 (4.5 stars)These really are good, a light & tasty cookie with a sweet peanut butter filling. I've tried other name brands and like these better. They're probably better for you too, although I don't usually worry much about ingredients except for the fat content, and these are plenty low enough at 2.5 grams each. I'll be buying more."
3,Maggie Cheung is fantastic.,"The best thing about ""Clean"" are the brilliant performances from Maggie Cheung and Nick Nolte. There's a vulnerability yet sharp edgeness to Cheung's performance. Nolte provides a sense of purity in his acting. What I mean by that is there's nothing overdone in his performance--it's clean and simple. What I didn't like about ""Clean"" was the fact that it tended to drag at times--especially when the Cheung character relocates to Paris. What's her conflict? To clean up her act so she can see her kid? That's not much to base a film on. Nor is it anything new. I think ""Clean"" needed a better story arc. And the lesbian angle was totally unnecessary. It didn't add anything to the story."
3,"Actually it deserves 3.5, NOT 3","Nick Nolte was superb as a grandpa with his hands full of life's issues. However, the story was too mundane for me.The irresponsibility of adults who refuse to grow up and then the desire to get return on zero investment I always find annoying.Yet, I guess that's what makes us human. A desire for redemption and second chance. The scene where the protagonist reaches SF and looks at the bridge and her breaking down in tears was the most telling part of the entire movie. Especially when she looks at the cup of coffee and feels the warm reassurance that radiates from the silent cup, by the California bay. Wish I could give it four stars, but the story and the script was not strong enough. It was done more in a French style, and I am slightly subjectively biased against French mode of storytelling.Other than that, it's a OK show."
4,Small Gem with Great Performances,"Olivier Assayas's Clean is one of those small independant films that deserves a wide audience. Clean is the story of Emily Wang (Maggie Cheung) a junkie who may or may not have supplied the drugs that killed her fading rock star husband Lee(James Johnston). Following his death and a short prison sentence she must pull her life together and rebuild the connection with her young son Jay (James Dennis) who is currently in the custody of his grandparents Albrecht (Nick Nolte) and Rosemary.This is a simple yet very human story with great performances from both Cheung and Nolte. The story takes place in both Canada and France. Cheung 's performance in English, French and Chineseis amazing (it won best actress at the Cannes Film Festival).For a film that did not have a wide distribution, this is a sleeper that deserves to be seen"
1,thanks for taking my money,Well thank you very much for taking my money. I am deployed and needed a printer to print pictures of my family. When I ordered your printer. I could not read all parts of the product comments that said use for parts only in the print out that came with my worthless printer. Thanks

4,Thoroughly entertaining!,"This book is less philosophical than many of Harrison's works. The main character is a hilarious buffoon that had me cracking up throughout, though I thought the beginning was pretty slow. Very high in entertainment value, with the usual J. Harrison sex, but more of it. Keep it in the bathroom when you're finished and leaf through it for laughs now and then!"
1,Top Trails San Francisco Bay Area: Must-do Hikes for Everyone,"The descriptions for the trails are very vague and hard to follow. We tried two times to find a trail and both times seemed to take a wrong route, its just not clearly marked."
5,"The life of an old man, in it's simplest form..observance.","Frank Turner Hollon has created a book full of rich and vivid characters. He introduces each at just the right moment. From his dying grandmother to his dying best friend, each has a deep and profound affect on both the old man and the reader. Just as in life, Mr. Hollon takes us through a variety of emotions, including complacency.This is neither a happy book nor a sad book. It is simply a book about life. And maybe a little too lifelike. It forces the reader to think about the part of life that most of us don't want to think about at all. The part that is near the end.The Pains of April is very well written and holds the readers attention through to the end. Both it's humorous and sad situations left me with the feeling that I had been, or could imagine myself being, in just that type of situation. Excellent!"
1,Disappointing read...,"It's my own fault that I fell for the publicist's hype for this book. Unfortunately, it was a pain to read but being a ""novella"" at least the agony was short-lived. The Pains of April lacks depth, the characters are wooden and the writing is simply not there. I honestly believe this effort was rushed to print way before its time."
2,"Dated, but detailed","While this book has a 1993 publication date, it was originally written in 1960 and little (if any) changed. The book offers a good discussion of gnosticism and of the relationship between the canonical gospels and the Gospel of Thomas. It also benefits from a discussion of each of the sayings, and relates the Thomas sayings to the existing Gospel sayings. What the book lacks is any attempt at analysing the sayings to create a coherent picture of Jesus, or at least, the Jesus whom the gnostics chose to remember. The authors flatly say that such an analysis is not warranted, but, in my humble opinion, I beg to differ. Also the book rarely discusses other gnostic gospels, and when it does so, it does it relatively superficially. Nonetheless, compared to other Gospels of Thomas, this version is better than average."
2,"You need small lemons... and big, strong hands!","This will only juice small to med. sized lemons. Lemons with a larger circumference will overlap the sides when cut in half. It is also pretty tough for me to squeeze without really hurting my hands. The cut side of the lemon goes down and the curved part presses the lemon on the top until it collapses and turns inside out. That takes a lot of force, with the handles a good 5-6 inches apart. I would imagine a lot of women's hands aren't that big or strong. I am currently looking for a better solution, perhaps a stand press with a lever."
2,Made in China,"Product was decent, but nothing told me it was made in China and with the problems there of lead paint, I remain very concerned, especially since this will be used on a acidic fruit!"
1,Worthless piece of junk,"This product is a worthless piece of junk, don't waste your time or money on it. The handle broke off the very first time I used it to squeeze a lemon. This is obviously a very cheap knock-off of a similarly designed product you might find in a retail store."
1,"don't order if distributor is Get and Go Imports, LLC","We bought this model because of multiple good reviews and recommendations by rating services. Unfortunately, the product as shipped was damaged, and this isn't something that happened in transit. Lots of paint chipped off. Plus the now we have to wait 48 hours for the shipper to authorize a return. Not a customer service experience we are accustomed to with amazon.Amco Enameled Aluminum Lemon Squeezer"
2,Broke too easily.,"I used this to squeeze lemons and limes. It worked maybe 10 times until the handle snapped. Before it broke, it worked great."
1,Handle broke off first time I used it.,Handle broke off first time I used it. I don't recommend this product. It seems to be made to some kind of cheap brittle aluminum.
4,Easiest Way to Squeeze Juice,"I like this juicer so well, I just purchased several to give as gifts. It will also juice limes, but not oranges. Only negative thing is that the pulp sticks to the finish and has to be scrubbed off."
2,Poor quality,Cracked after 2 months. I was very disappointed in the quality of the product I mean we were just squeezing lemons
2,Not the actual Amco brand,"I purchased this to go along with my Amco lime squeezer (do I need both...maybe not, but regardless), and the product I received was not the Amco brand. This was a knock-off that looks very similar to Amco's but is not the actual Amco brand. Amco's squeezers have AMCO stamped in the metal at the hinge. I was able to return it easily through Amazon. It may have worked fine (never actually used it) but I thought I was getting Amco, and I didn't so back it went."
4,Sqeeze me,Love it. I quarter the lemon & it is easy to sqeeze using the lemon sqeezer into my glass of water.
1,Terrible!,"First time using this to squeeze some lemon juice and it broke in half in my hand. I'm not that strong, buyer beware."
3,Great way to put the squeeze on lemons and limes,"This tool has proven to be exactly what is needed to quickly extract juice from our citrus. It has held up well for nearly two months with at least twice daily use. We're happy with it so far.UPDATE - 01/08/2013 - The enamel coating on the inside of the strainer has begun to peel. So, six months of daily use reveals a weakness. Otherwise, it remains a handy tool, though now reduced to 3 stars."
4,Not dishwasher safe,I love this juicer. It works great. But it's absolutely not dishwasher safe. The enamel coating chips off after a while. Handwashing will get better results anyway; crud tends to build up inside the juicer.
1,Broke after only a few uses,"As another reviewer mentioned, this lemon juicer worked fine the first few times but then the handle broke off on maybe the third or fourth use. Disappointing."
2,Flaking Enamel,After about a year we noticed the enamel flaking from inside this device. Not something we want to digest. It functions fine but we're thinking stainless might be the way to go.
2,Nice while it lasted,"I received the Amco squeezer as a gift and it worked fine until it snapped at the hinge while squeezing a lime with normal pressure. I've read reviews of other squeezers that cite the same problem.I went online to replace this Amco squeezer, but found the Norpro stainless steel product and am going to buy it and see if it holds up better.The concept is great though ... makes making fresh margharitas almost too easy."
3,Just OK,"The quality of this squeezer seems fine, but it doesn't work as well as I would like. It leaves more juice on the lemon rind than it should. There is unsqueezed pulp left in every lemon I squeeze. It also is for small lemons. I can't use it for most of the fruit from the lemon tree in my back yard."
5,Putting the squeeze on lemons!,"I had a juicer shaped like a woman's breast (?) that you rotated the lemon half back and forth on - worked OK, but a lot of work. Saw this one on Americas Test Kitchen. It is so fast and easy!! Pop the lemon half in, and an easy squeeze later the lemon is drained. Easy clean up too. Fantastic squeezer!"
2,Worked great while it lasted,This was a great lemon squeezer while it lasted. The top handle broke off while I was using it after about three months of occasional use. I would not recommend this product.
1,Junk - broke in less than 5 uses,very fragile.... broke where handle joins the squeezer - basically fell apart - seems to be made of cast pot metal
5,Great Too,"I like these Amco squeezers. You can't beat the price, and they work well with minimal effort. Lets me squeeze all the juice out with minimal effort."
4,A good squeeze,"This handy tool is a must have for any kitchen and for all people who use a large amount of lemon in their cuisine. I know I do and I am happy with my purchase. It had a good comfortable grip and enough leverage to extract a fantastic amount of juice from the yellow fruit. Sometimes the lemon curls back inside out and the juice levels are not optimum. But one can surely adjust. Also the pin joining the two arms could do with a bit of beefing up.Other than that I see that some reviewers are not happy since it cannot be washed in a dishwasher. I say to them, bad idea anyway. This is a quick use thing, squeeze and wash immediately, much more pragmatic to hand wash. Now I have had it for a month and till date, I have nothing adverse against it. Highly Recommended."
1,Worked for a month ...,Don't buy this juicer if you want it to last! The part that encloses the pin about which the two halves pivot is very weak and breaks far too easily--a major design flaw for an item made out of (relatively) soft aluminum.
2,Not an Amco lemon squeezer,"So I didn't need the lemon squeezer for a while so I didn't open the package. To my surprise it wasn't the Amco Enameled Lemon Squeezer I ordered but some brand called Home Basics, and it's basic. The one I received isn't very heavy and seems pretty cheap. Also I learned to open my packages as it is past the point where I can return it. Amazon, you are on my shit list right now."
2,The Lemon Squeezer Broke!,I guess I thought this lemon squeezer would be more durable. I only used it a few times and it snapped in half! Very disappointing.
2,Works until it breaks,"I got this based on Cooks Illustrated recommendation, and it works great for a such a simple design. However, about a month after buying it, it broke on my while I was juicing a lime. I was using it exactly as intended, and it completely cracked at the joint between the handle and cup/bowl. I will be contacting AMCO to see what they are willing to do for me."
5,Good,Good squeezer just wish the price was better. It world great but sometimes the limescale builds up on the unit.
1,"The ""enamel"" goes into the juice!","I noticed these colorful squeezers for lemons and limes eventually lose the colorful outer coating -- it's more like paint than ""enamel"" but whatever the marketing claim, it eventually breaks and ends up in the juice. That can't be healthy. When I'm thinking of it and I'm in a friend's kitchen, I'll ask i they've got one and if they do, it's invariably worn or chipped.There are stainless steel citrus juice squeezers with no paint -- I suggest you choose stainless steel.I would rate this zero stars, but Amazon wants at least one star. I guess we can consider one star to mean ""won't kill you straight away"" ... equivalent to cigarettes ..."
4,"Solid construction, easy to use","This lemon squeezer was recommended by America's Test Kitchen/Cooks Illustrated. I had a wooden, handheld juicer prior to this that I like, but it often allowed lots of pulp and seeds into the juice. This is a great improvement. The metal construction makes it solid and the enamel finish is quite nice. Limes and small oranges can easily be handled by this gadget as well.I did learn after using one of these for a while (from an 11-year-old, of course -- I never claim to know all things for this very reason), that the lemon is supposed to go in the bottom cup cut-side down. This initially seemed counterintuitive to me, thinking that the juicer side should press into the fruit. No. The juicer side should invert the lemon peel -- this will help it work much, much better as the juice can flow freely from the bottom holes and the inversion of the rind forces more of the juice out."
2,Works GREAT. Doesn't last . . . enamel peels,"Was saddened to see a favorite kitchen tool, which wasn't cheap, lose enamel and make it unsafe to use. PIty"
2,Disappointing,Does not appear to be any larger than the lime juicers and as a result folds the edges of the lemon over. Results in a very incomplete juicing. Wonder if the orange squeezer would perform better for lemons.
2,Enamel chips off after a while into your drink,We've been pressing about 10-15 limes/lemons per week over the past year with this press. It's cute thanks to the coloring and works well BUT after a while sharp enamel chips fall right into your drinks / food which is very dangerous. So one either replaces this item every 3-6 months or one buys a stainless steel press instead.
2,Hinge Snapped,"We used this lemon squeezer less than 10 times before it completely broke. The first time, the pins in the hinge fell out. I was able to put it back together easily. The next (and last) time it broke a part of the metal casing that holds the hinge in place broke completely."
1,Weak metal on critical stress point,"My copy of this squeezer lasted less than a month, then cracked at the point the handle meets the bowl. Bottom line: You cannot squeeze very hard or else you will eventually break it. This is disappointing, because you cannot squeeze out all the juice unless you're pressing down hard."
1,Broke on Second Use,"Purchased for sister-in-law. It broke the 2nd time she used it. It's just made from cheap pot metal with the yellow enamel on top. Will return. Am tempted to get the stainless steel one, but reviewers indicate that the handles bend on that one. Sigh..."
3,Passable Single Fruit Squeezer,"There is too much clearance between the top and bottom when this item is closed. It leaves about 1/4"" of fruit that doesn't get squeezed. What this means is that you can squeeze lemons and small oranges, but Limes don't get juiced well at all.As an alternative I highly recommend the Pampered Chef Citrus Press - it costs about $15 and it will press ANY citrus fruit. It is also heavy and sturdy - it feels like something out of the 40's or 50's that was designed to last generations, while the Amco feels like it was designed to last a year or two."
1,Terrible Product,"This product broke the first time I used it. The entire handle broke off and I'm not that strong, I think it's better to invest a little more to get something more durable."
2,Ineffective and cheap,"I've been squeezing lemons for years with traditional coned squeezers, and I never thought I would possibly be writing a review for a lemon squeezer, but I have 2 major problems with this squeezer.1) Upon first use, a hairline crack formed where the handle meets the circular part. Now I'm afraid that it could snap every time I use it, causing injury. Believe me, crazier things have happened. Now if this was the only problem, I'd send it back because I'm sure the company would replace it, which leads me to the next problem.2) This lemon squeezer doesn't work well. It gets half as much juice out of the lemon as a traditional coned squeezer would. I'm buying twice as many lemons at the store, so not only is this device frustrating me, it's getting into my pockets beyond the its principal cost.It gets 2 stars because it works, but do yourself a favor and buy a coned squeezer."
1,"Cheaply made, easily broken","This lasted all of one month in our house. I was a little wary when I first received it as it was much lighter in weight than the similar device it replaced, but I ignored the thought. Really wish I hadn't. This morning, after less than ten uses, an arm snapped right off it while juicing a lemon. And for the record, it was no mutant stone lemon. Just run of the mill citrus. Spend the extra $5 and get the real deal--""enameled aluminum"" is code for cheap."
3,squeezer.,Didn't want to buy the p-chef one. Should have.It works but not as easy as others I've seen. It just seems like there is a better way to squeeze the stuffing out of a lemon than the way it's constructed.Do I still use it? Yes.Do I want to donate it to goodwill? Yes.Have I yet? No. Haven't got my $$ out of it yet.Bummer.
1,DO NOT BUY! Snapped in half after 2 weeks! Hurt my finger!,"Do not buy this product! I had it for less than 2 weeks before it snapped in half while I was squeezing a lemon half. I was squeezing hard but certainly not out of normal use of the product when the handle snapped off. It didn't even break at the joint, the metal actually broke. On top of that, it left me with a nasty bruise on my finger tip. Avoid!"
1,Works for a few months then enamel cracks and peels into your lemon juice,"This squeezer works really well when you first get it. After about 2 months of regular use (about 2 or 3 times a week) it is unusable. The yellow enamel cracks, peels and falls through the holes that the lemon/lime juice squeezes out of and contaminates everything. Avoid this one and all painted/enamel squeezers and just get a solid stainless steel one."
1,CAUTION : Save your money!,"It's made from a cheap, weak aluminum alloy metal. It started out great, but the top handle cracked off before I got through the sixth lemon half. I would suggest that you shop around for something a little more sturdy."
1,Failed on First Use,First lemon. First use. Failed. Cracked where handle meets bowl. Returned. Had high expectations of lots of lemon juice. Not sure how to make this review into lemonade.
1,Item returned,"Poor packaging upon arrival (Item in plastic bag with minimal packing material around it).The enamel on mine was already chipped when I got it. The paint looked pretty terrible in general, kind of blotchy and uneven. I didn't even try the item out, returned in for a refund. Plan to just buy one at target when I get the chance."
1,BROKE!!!!!! after one use,Yup Garbage....broke after the first lime I squeezed! Top handle broke like a cheap $1 store ornament...don't waste your time
1,"cheap pot metal casting, broke after 10 days.","It did work just fine, but it didn't ""get every drop"" and will, if you are not careful, pinch skin. When I did try to give it an extra squeeze, one handle snapped right off.It's in the trash now.On the other hand, shipping Was fast and the thing was cheap. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,"Broke after a couple uses, like everyone else","This product got mixed reviews, but I thought I would take a chance. Bad gamble on my part. The handle broke off after I put no more than 5 lemons through it. The first few times I used it, I cut the peel off the lemon (recommended by a reviewer to get more juice) and it worked okay, since less force was required. This last time I used it, I put the half lemon in to see how it worked. On the first squeeze, the handle cracked...by the time I finished out the lemon it had snapped off.Don't waste your time. This product is cheap and not strong at all. Believe me! Avoid die cast aluminum...it is not strong and you'll regret it. You'll pay more for a stronger squeezer (stainless steel), but it will be worth it in the long run.Unfortunately I don't use this very often and the handle broke outside of the return window. So, the only place this is going is in the trash."
2,Leaves lots of juice,"For a lemon squeezer, I have to cut the edges off a lemon most of the time to fit the lemon and then it curls back in on itself, causing me to use a fork to get all the juice. I rarely use this over a fork and I wish I had not wasted my money on this product. I have an old aluminum citrus squeezer in my vacation house. Its 20 years old and works 100 times better then this."
2,pretty nice im 50/50,"Seems like this will last VERY long time so good or bad its a keeper. actually it works VERY quickly half a lemon is squeezed in far less than 1 second! I seem to have a lot of juice left in the lemon after I squeeze it though and that is beginning to disappoint me? (i live in CA and at a average super market lemons are 1 dollar each!) lemons have become expensive for some reason, so if you really want to maximize the juice from the lemon id move on maybe to a different one? Beacause it doesent matter haw hard you squeeze, the two cups dont actually touch????? so when you squeeze the handle all the way closed until they touch each other the lemon inside is not all the way squished? there's more that a 1/4 inch on the inside, of space when fully closed? (""MORE than"" emphasised)If i owned a lemon tree and wasn't so stingy about how much juice i get from each lemon then the SPEED of this thing would make it awesome. but that not my situation lol, im paying a buck per lemon!"
2,"Good functionality, but enamel peels off","I've owned three of these, and with regular use (3-4 times a week) and handwashing, the enamel / paint comes off after a year or so. I actually watched a chip of the paint dissolve in lemon juice. I'm assuming it's not toxic, but it's a little disconcerting to have pieces of your kitchen hardware dissolve in your food.I'd recommend investing in a plain stainless steel citrus press."
2,"good design works, but bad enamel doesn't stand up for long","I've had both the yellow lemon squeezer and the green lime squeezer for nearly a year -- and now both of them are loosing their enamel. We use them a lot -- and I expected more.Also, they don't give up the natural oils of the rinds in the dishwasher, and end up having to be washed by hand periodically. The small bowl shape is a real mess to try and clean."
5,A fast and easy to use juicer,We just moved to California and bought one of these to deal with the great little lemon tree in our backyard. It is wonderful! It's fast and efficient with super easy cleanup (I can't see why you would need to put it in the dishwasher and risk the paint peeling with how easy it is to clean). I would recommend it for light or heavy users without reservation.
2,Paint Peels Off!,The paint peels off after so long. Probably from the dishwasher or could be from the acid in the citrus. It hasn't fallen apart yet though or broken which is great and I've had it for many years. But I'm looking for a new one that doesn't have paint on it.
5,Very enjoyable recording of the music McCreesh does best,"An excellent CD of Venetian Christmas music. The Missa ""Prter rerum serium"" by Cipriano de Rore is excellent. The works of Gabrieli are good, too. Nice to have new recordings of Salvator noster and Audite principes!The use of tenor cornetts on this recording was a highlight for me. I bought one a few years ago, and it is nice to hear them so well played here.The arrangement of Quem vidistis pastores is interesting. Hugh Keyte has certainly filled the score out. However, I have never found the score as it stands inadequate.Anyway, a wonderful Christmas album and one to enjoy all year round."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This book has been absolutely no help to me at all in the game. There are errors and omissions, muddy maps that don't have some important areas marked, and it is generally lacklustre in effort. It makes you wonder if the author actually played the game. My suggestion is to save your money, and go to a couple of the websites that exist for the game. The Ironworks has a Wizards and Warriors Forum and there are *accurate* walkthroughs for the game."
3,Better than nothing!,"OK, it's not the best strategy guide, but given the skimpy manual and the glossy but inaccurate map that comes with the game, it gets the job done. As an early reviewer wrote, there are missing parts and some serious errors. What really hurts the most is the lack of a ""by the numbers"" walk through: First do this, then next you go here, don't go to C before you've talked to B, etc. There is some of that, in a few places, but not nearly enough. And the encounter guides give you little information on how tough your foes will be. For example, it ought to say don't try the toad quest until your party is at level xxx and has yyy hit points or you'll be slaughtered. So, is it worth the money? Yes, but just barely!"
1,Pitiful excuse for a guide book...,What you get here is page after page of misinformation. And.. just to add to the mix.. ommissions that are critically important to completing quests.. not to mention obtaining the game's ultimate goal. One entire (and very huge) area has no corresponding map what so ever.Save your money and visit the fan sites. You'll get better info there.
5,Of Wizards and of Warriors...,"Got my book in today and was really pleased at the condition it was in, it was basicly like new! Anyway the book is very useful at listing quest and showing detailed maps (even though the picture are in black in white). Having this book at least helps you get an idea of where your going and what to do. If you have the game and online walkthroughs arn't detailed enough, I'd get this book. It is very useful for helping you keep track of your quest for the Mavin Sword."
3,A Must Read,"You've got to read this book. Not because it's all that good, but, as a black woman, we've (black men and women) got to find out what's wrong with SOME of our men. Donnell Alexander is the problem. Now, i'm not suggesting he be killed or even harmed, just examined. So buy his book and wonder... what happened."
1,Tell me again why I'm supposed to care?,"My only question is who is Donnell Alexander, and why am I supposed to care about him? He portrays himself as a celebrity, however this celebrity is in his own mind. This book is a vulgar memoir that no one but himself and his friends, if he still has any after this book, could care about! After reading this book, it's no wonder his marriage disintegrated!"
1,steam+heat= bad for your hair....,"when i bought this thing, i didnt know this, but my hairdresser told me to stop using it because if you use a hot flat iron like this one when your hair has moisture in it it fries your hair. it didnt even work that well for me. my hair is pretty straight but the front goes wavy and frizzy. i would use it, then 10 minutes later its wavy and frizzy again. also it has no automatic off so i've left if on all day a couple times. the little canister that you put the water in on the end has a felt tipped wick and that part got burnt to the heating element. didnt smell good and its not very safe. i've tried using it without the water canister attached and it doesnt work well because the heated surface is too small in width. i liked the comb part though, i pulls your hair taught so it doent slip through the flat parts."
1,Worst ever,I have long thick wavy hair and this just makes it worse! No matter if it rainy out or not your hair is going to be fizzy. It took forever to heat up and you had to replace the water seemed like every 10 mins. Go for something more money and not a steam straightener!!
1,NO NO NO!!!!,"if i could give it no stars i would, but that wasnt an option. this was obviously meant for people with curly hair that is not textured. it doesnt do the job for people who have a certain kinkiness to their hair. All it will do it heat it up enough to ruin your hair. DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!"
2,Good but...,"This product gives good results, but has a tendency to leak scalding water from the steam vents."
4,Pleased,"I have nice long wavy hair that is full of body. The Conair Straight Styles Steam Straightener gave me straight hair and left the body to my hair. My hair stayed full, and thick, without getting frizzy. It also let me choose the type of straight that I wanted. For example, I could have stick straight hair, or straight hair with it flipped inward to give it more body and make it fuller."
1,Not for me,"This product just didn't work. First i had to blow dry my hair and then use the iron, and it still left my hair frizzy and big. Want something better? I recommend Revlon's hair straightener. It worked great!"
1,"good god, stay away","I recieved this as a gift. Now, I have naturally curly hair-not kinky curly, but not loose waves either. Now, being that it was a gift I was of course polite and acted excited. I did try it knowing full well this was not going to work. I was right. My hair looked 10 times bigger then it normally is. The steam made my hair so puffy and frizzy it was comical. Stay away if you have naturally curly hair. Steam and curls are not a good combo. My hair looked like I sat in a sauna all day-YIKES!"
1,i wouldn't even pay $2 for this product,"DO NOT BUY THIS IRON.i used to have long slightly wavy hair, but after a shorter cut plus bangs, i decided i needed to buy a straightener so i bought this one at a local pharmacy for $20.it did not do anything for me. it couldn't even straighten my bangs. all it did was damage my hair. in fact, my hair looked frizzier after i used it.i went to my hairdresser and she suggested i buy the chi ceramic straightening iron, which i bought and have been using for 2 years.if you're going to invest in a straightening iron, get a ceramic one because they actually work and they don't fry your hair.this product should be taken off the market. conair products tend to be bad in gerneral."
4,Steam is good!,"I actually purchased this item on a whim while in Florida (USA), and the humidity was making my hair look like one of those Swiffer duster pads... I had little to no expectation of satifaction...I bought it as an act of pure desperation. I dried my hair until it was only a tiny bit damp, and then started to steam iron it. After a litte adjusting, my frizzy/fine/long hair was smooth and shiny...so pretty that my husband couldn't stop running his fingers through it. I love this iorn!"
4,SMOOTH & SHINY!,"This product works really well to smooth and straighten curly hair. The addition of steam seems to give hair an added sheen.If you're going to use it on a daily basis a conditioner or other hair product would be helpful. Also, if hair is very naturally curly some slight touches of hair spray will hold the ""straightness"" for a longer period of time.For a really shiny look add a bit of gloss."
2,Shortlived Satisfaction,"When I bought the straightener I was instantly unsatisfied with the lack of heat it produced. It took many different tries to get 1 inch sections of my hair straight. After just 1 month from the purchase date, only one side of the iron worked. Unfortunately I couldn't find my receipt and was stuck with half a straightener."
1,STUNK,"This straightener only works well for slightly wavy hair like mine, but when I used it one my friend who has very wavy hair it performed very poorly, ... so in the end I wouldn't reccomend this product."
1,Where is the life in these people?,"Mallet-Joris seems to have drained the life and passion from La Fayette and Louis XIII. They were deeply in love and parting was agonising for both, but you would never know it from this anaemic piece of writing. In my view it does no justice to either."
1,"HORRENDOUS, AN INSULT TO EVEN JUDEO-CHRISTIAN BELIEFS","A horrendous book which insults the Muslim religion. A non-theocratical book, with no real insight into the actual book. This book should focus more on why there is a need to convert Muslims in the first place, firstly starting with the problem rather than a bigoted solution. I do not recommend this book even if you feel the need to convert a Muslim. Rather I suggest a better method-reading both the Holy Quran and the New Testament and then deriving a belief or solution."
4,A Must Read!!!,Held my attention from start to finish.Looking forward to reading more about Honey Sinclair. I would recommend this novel (e~book) to my friends.
5,Ford Explorer Window Regulator,This was my first experience with replacing a window regulator. The part arrived in good time and as described. The quality appears to be very good. Installation was not exactly fun but this was Ford's design. The regulator parts fit snugly through the inner door openings and lined up exactly like OEM. I would highly recommend this part for replacement and if you are brave enough the install is not bad either! Significant savings over buying from dealer and some auto parts stores.
2,Disapointed,"Worked for about a year then it broke. I contacted Dorman they refused to replace it, even though they advertise a lifetime warranty. They told me I would have to contact Amazon for a replacement. I contacted Amazon and they refused to replace it because it was outside of the 30 return period."
5,Intresting& wonderful book!,"Mary Summer Rain wrote this book very well. She made me feel as though I was there with her and No-Eyes. I loved how Mary got to travel to different places in her lessons. The book made me realize some things. To find out about all the things that No-Eyes talked about, read this book!!!"
5,'Spirit Song' Sings!,"If you're searching for a grounded and nature-based theosophy, dig into Mary Summer Rain's books, starting with her first published book. The autobiographical 'Spirit Song' envelopes you in a living breathing Earth Mother via the Colorado woods, the Chippewa visionary No-Eyes, and the author's own youthful exuberance. In this book, Summer Rain deeply depicts the magic that abounds when one truly begins her spiritual instruction."
2,Boring,"I had high expectations for this book, both because I loved The Aztec and because the ratings were so stellar. Unfortunately, my hopes were not confirmed. While it seems well researched and the subject is so interesting, there are many boring passages. It also focus a lot on the sexual practices of the time/place, with very long descriptions. I do not have a problem with the sex passages per se, but they are long and boring."
2,disappointed,Having loved Aztec I was really disappointed with this story. I actually started to get bored along the way. Also there are some very disturbing scenes of child molestation. I really don't think they were necessary to the enhance the story.
3,Boring,i bought this book because I loved Aztec. But this book wasnt in the same league. I was so bored with it I couldnt finish it. I dont recommend it.
2,Harcover version is misleading,"It's some kind of reprint company and the quality is poor. The font size is also almost unreadably tiny. I am very disappointed with it. That said the book itself is unbelievably good. I'd read it when it first came out in the '80s and decided I needed a copy for my library. But do youself a favor, save the cash and get the paperback."
5,Thrilling,Gary Jennings isn't for everybody but if your into explicit literature and have an open mind this Jennings will become one of your favorite authors. The way he describes even the simplest of food so well you can almost taste it with the character.Jennings will awaken your imagination buds to a different intensity than than normal. Thats probably why not everyone is as accepting to The Journeyer or any other books...The Journeyer and Raptor have got to be the top picks for me. Highly Recommendable! YOu won't regret it!
5,MASTER WRITER,"I have found all the Gary Jennings novels to be excellant adventures though by far my favorite is ""Spangle"" which is about a 19th century traveling circus. This book was broken down to 3 paperbacks which are ""Road Show"", ""The Center Ring"" and ""Grand Promenade"""
3,Diminishing returns,"I really enjoyed the first half of the book although I'd say it's probably too long by about 300 pages. Things really slowed down for me towards the end and I actually skipped the entire India chapter because I just didn't care anymore. A good read, although there is a lot of bizarre sexual content that I found objectionable."
2,I just did not get it.,"I am so sorry but this book just seemed like the same thing was going on over and over again. Get to a town, decribe it. Eat and describe that. Lodge and describe that. Have one little thing happen then it was on to the next town and the same thing again. I got half way and gave up. I do intend to read AZTEC though. I see it has very good reviews and I want to give this author another chance."
5,Repeat Reading For Years!,"If you enjoy ""visiting"" other cultures and different eras of history, Gary Jennings is a master! With a very realistic expression of characters, their emotions, actions and unexpected changes in circumstances, Mr. Jennings must capture a very close semblance of history with each reading... this is one of my favorite genres. This author gives you detailed details - real life scenarios which are suitable for avid readers who are mature in mind while young at heart. My last copy fell apart from age & use a few years ago - so I'm ordering a few copies today! The Aztec trilogy is excellent reading too!"
5,AWESOME!!!!!,"I read this book about 8 years ago and it's still with me to this day. Unquestionably my favorite Jennings book, my favorite book that I've ever read. Lush, bawdy, passionate, robust, spellbounding... I can't praise this book, or Jennings, enough. I was SHOCKED to see an entry of only one star. The person said he gave it one star but maybe he was missing something. Yes, I agree.This is one of those books that leaves you depressed when you finish it because there isn't any more to read!"
2,Not nearly as good as Aztec,"Hate to spoil the We-love-Jennings party, but I just didn't think it was that good. I read lots of historical fiction, and I did enjoy Aztec by the same author. The Journeyer however was simply boring. Compare it to Creation by Gore Vidal, where a Persian guy covers pretty much the same terrain, and you know what I mean. Whereas that book is full of intelligence and ideas, this one is simply...empty. It's the only word that comes to mind. Historical fiction lovers out there, don't waste your time on this one. Do read Aztec, but steer clear from mr. Jennings other books (Raptor was just as boring)."
1,Just fiction..a historical fantasy,"A masterful use of events occuring in history. What is however disconcerting is the character & tradition demolition of certain ethnic groups through his fictional character of Marco Polo in the book. He has distorted the customs, traditions & habits of people that Marco Polo supposedly met in his journeys. Strangely, this even contradicts what Marco Polo wrote about the same people or nations in his original Franco-Genovese narrative ""The Description of the World"". True, history is written by the survivors, & also true, fiction takes creative license to weave more romantic & readable stories to make history go down easier.. thats what the book is meant to be..just fiction..if you want to really read about Marco Polo , go somewhere else."
2,Aztec Autumn is a very disappointing sequel to Aztec,"I am a huge fan of Jennings other books, including Spangle, The Journeyer and Aztec. All of them rate a 10+! Not-so Aztec Autumn. Aztec Autumn has none of the depth nor detail found in the critically-acclaimed Aztec. None of the characters in Aztec Autumn captured my imagination or held my interest. The historical events and locations described by Jennings are ordinary, lacking any zest, originality or intrigue. I can only conclude Jennings wrote this book under some kind of duress. Aztec Autumn is that bad when compared to ANY of his other books!"
1,"a disgusting, horrid book","One must wonder what kind of person the author is, considering the horrible scenarios he has created in this book. My recommendation is to stay far, far away from it."
1,I bought this book for 50 cents and it wasn't worth it.,"I don't know if I'm missing something but I found this book exceedingly boring. It's unbelievable to the point of ridiculousness; I just couldn't get into it through all the phony garbage. Also other than Venice, the places mentioned in the book are not described to the point where you feel you are actually in them. I love historical fiction and wish I had a good book to read about this same journey. I thought this book was going to be great. I am disappointed."
5,What a great read!,"I have a great affection for this book. I sincerely rate it as among the top three of my best list. There was way I could put this book down, and carried it everywhere with me. I have an older copy and lend it out a couple of times every year to friends who I know will just love it. What a joy from Gary Jennings. This is what all fiction should be."
5,The Journeyer,A great epic adventure! Tells the story of a young Marco Polo and his adventures in Persia and the Mongol Empire.A truely historic adventure!Highly recommended!
2,Too old. Get Dreamweaver!,"Visual Page is good for just getting a site up and running. Nothing else. I've had to hold up on my plans for learning DHTML and ASP because of this. Visual Page won't support them. The source code editing is way outdated and attempts to do the breaks for you. Numerous bugs, including presentation of transparent GIFs, make it annoying. I would hesitate to recommend this product unless you are in an economic fix and it already came with another Symantec product."
3,Only Beginners Will be Satisfied,"I can only recommend this software to absolute beginners with very little or no knowledge of Web publishing. To its credit, Visual Page does offer have excellent ""tour"" files and novices should be able to make their own Web pages after the first day. But other users will be sorely disappointed. It is simply not sophisticated enough for many and does not support enough features. I also frequently have a problem with text and graphics being misaligned once published.If you are just learning or need a Web site in a hurry, Visual Page has a lot to offer. But once you're beyond the beginning stage, there are far better Web publishing programs out there."
1,shake,"This DVD did not play. Not in a dvd player, computer or gaming system. When looking at the back of the DVD I noticed there was nothing even burned to the DVD. I bought this even though another reviewer said the same thing; that it did not play. I will listen next time."
1,Bad Disc,Movie never played in my media file. The movie file is not compat. with my computer. I will be returning it to Amazon.
2,Not what it seems,Wow this was not as described no where near male version of players club hardly the guys show skin and if you looking to see packages donot waste your money.it has positive tones but looking for skin and packages they keep it covered I watched and watched not much the bodies the good thing waste up they cover the rest.ration of fine guys cliftons hot but its only three fine ones on here .a waste
4,Shake,"I like this movie because it put a different twist on this hustle, long as your not killing anyone make your living the best way you can."
1,Bootleg DVD won't play,"After reading all the reviews, I purchased this DVD and was looking forward to seeing it. The day it arrived I popped it in the DVD player and nothing, I tried another DVD player and nothing happened. I thought it was a bad DVD, so I reported it and asked for a replacement. I was ambivalent about the second dvd and I was right to be because it did not work either, not in either DVD player or the laptop. A friend advised me it was a homemade DVD that someone slapped some artwork on to give it the appearance of being authentic. I was and am very disappointed. I am sending them both back. Odd how the disclaimer amazon gives if you are having a problem with the DVD and what to do about it, authentic DVD's don't come with this disclaimer. Amazon save your customers the trouble and stop selling this non-playing dvd."
1,Very Disappointed..,"Unfortunately, I had no time to actually review the movie.. I was sent a bum DVD. It wouldn't play in ANY of my dvd players, computer, xbox, etc... Definitely will be returned. Maybe I'll try it again."
5,OMG,THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME. IT SHOWS THE LIFE STYLE OF MALE STRIPPERS. FINALLY A MOVIE THAT SHOWS MEN INSTEAD OF WOMEN. YAY!
3,Disappointed,"I gave it three stars only because the characters are fine and sexy. It left me with to many unexplained situations, for example, the promoter who used drugs when he gotten kidnapped or the people that murder his brother. There were other gaps in the story that did not add up."
5,Exhilarating for all ages,This is a basically a nature film on steroids. The cinematography is awesome. Penguins appear to fly under water. Whales emerging out of seemingly bottomless seas. Large schools of fish appear as synchronized single units. Strange creatures who live in depths where daylight never penetrates.This movie is just amazing. It gave me a whole new love for this beautiful planet we live on. I think people of all ages would have the same reaction; and to think we use the oceans as a waste dump.This movie may be needed for the future of this planet. All children could keep an appreciation for their home and perhaps perceive the earth as a single living organism. It should be mandatory viewing for all members of US Congress along with their families. It should be seen by ALL world leaders and politicians.
2,Deep Blue,"Beautiful photography - but WHAT WAS I WATCHING?? Great music to match (seemed to be the main focus of the movie), but very little commentary as to what you are watching. May be great for people that are already aware of what is being filmed, but if you hope to learn anything - forget it! We were very disappointed - could have been a great educational nature film but failed royally!"
4,Beautiful Images,"This is not a hard core documentary that satisfies a hunger for learning. Instead, it is an appetizer to whet the appetite. It is survey of the polar environments and the lifeforms that inhabit them. The video is stunning and the narration is adequate. For young people, it will be quite a treat. For those hungering for more information, they will not find it here. That does not stop the enjoyment, however. It is well done."
2,Disappointing,The cinematogrophy was good but there was not enough informative narration. I felt as if I were watching my aquatic screensaver.
3,Blue planet DVD is this and more.,"This DVD has some very nice footage, but if you own blue planet you have seen this before. Even much of the music is the same. It is identical footage re-cut and re-edited with little narration and not almost nothing informative.Do not get me wrong, it is pretty. Just not quite a best of Blue Planet. But for 10$ more you can get the entire 5 disk Blue Planet set, right now from amazon. Before buying this check out Blue Planet. I'm sure you'll want to compare both to compare price vs content."
5,I gave up trying to pick up my jaw off the floor,"There are scenes in this movie that will boggle your mind and stretch the limits of your imagination. As someone who loves watching nature documentaries, it's not often I see something that I have never seen before. This movie has at least a dozen of those moments.There are several amazing sequences in this movie. One of killer whales beaching themselves to hunt seals along the shore is frightening and displays nature at it's rawest. Another of a pod of dozens of dolphins acrobatically flying out of the water and doing summersaults and spins for no apparent reason shows nature's playfullness.But by far, the most amazing moments in this film are when it goes down into the deepest depths. Here the film shows creatures that are so bizarre, so beyong imagining, I began to wonder what else is out there. This 10 minute sequence alone is worth the price of admission. You won't be disappointed."
5,A great retirement investing guid,"I am recently retired, and an avid investor. This is the absolute best retirement planning and basic investing book I have found. It distills complex topics, such as modern portfolio theory, into easy to follow, easy to read chapters. I have bought a half dozen copies I have given to my kids and friends, and plan to buy more. This is a must read for people from college age through well into retirement age."
2,Dot drill mat,This mat simple slides to much for users over 100 pounds this is more for a young athlete. It does help improve quickness and agility and coordination and (stamina- a little). I also hat that the dots are screen printed and the mat barely even weighs 5lbs. i recommended this to ages 12 and under.
2,Great for boring candlelight dinner or quick ride in an elevator.,"As much as I enjoy listening to Placido Domingo's popular recordings this is not one of his best performances. Missing the full-blooded belting that can be heard on his other albums (""Be My Love"" for example). The orchestration is very mediocre and uninspired.For a romantic mood, ""Perhaps Love"" (simply fabulous) is much better choice."
5,Excellent,"Purchased as a gift for my wife. She really enjoyed it as it brought back memories of her summers in the Thousand Islands. This was the main book and the previous book was a companion to this. While both are excellent, of the two, I would recommend this one more."
3,Great little book,"This is a positive review of the book, but less than five stars because it is small, and feels half done. I would have liked it to be a bigger format, with bigger pictures, and more of them. It's like a tease. For the price, and as a light overview of some of the nicer houses, it's great. But it seems that it could have been something more."
4,Waterfront Estates,"Beautiful photography of the different seasons of this waterfront paradise. Lots of owner timeline history to the more famous islands and castles... NIce inside pictures of some of the rooms, porches and boathouses with the desirable wood boats. Good table top item or carry out for the afternoon... YES, do wish it was thicker & larger format like other A.Mollica boat books I have purchased."
4,Competent job as an intro graduate text,"A good follow-on book if you have already used Ashcroft and Mermin's Solid State Physics book, or Kittel's introductory book. Some duplicate material compared to those two books. But this takes you a little further into superconductivity, for example. The treatment of which is the classic Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory.At the graduate level, it is probably a first year text. Nothing here gets you to the research frontier. But it is a good grounding.You should find the writing clear enough. The authors seem to have spent some time polishing the prose."
4,"Ridiculous, Indeed.","150 pieces of classic literature distilled to limericks, letters, and in one case, a children's story (N.J. Warburton on Great Expectations: ""Here is Pip. Here is Pip's big sister. Pip's big sister is married to Joe the blacksmith. See Pip's big sister frown..."", etc). Parrott (the book's editor) solicited the entries from 30+ authors, requiring only that they be succinct and ""entertaining as well as enlightening"". A warning: despite the book's title, these parodies are more fun if you've actually read the works described. A great gift for an English major with a sense of humor!"
1,very low sound quality!!!!!,"the band and concert are great but i have to turn my tv up to 100 just to barely hear it, this should definitely be in pcm stero!"
1,What a big dissapointment!!!,"This DVD is a piece of junk, I find it hard to believe that such a great band like TS, couldn't have produced a better quality product, the audio SUCKS, didn't TS make a quality check before releasing their own product?, didn't they hear the extreme low quality audio?, how could they release this, it sounds worst than my old tv recorded TS VHS, I'm a big TS fan and I felt robed after watching this crap, I mean, if TS can't come out with a good stuff, THEN DON'T DO IT! [...]"
4,"nice movie, have to have it!","I have searched for this movie for a long time, I saw it many years ago and have ordered it for my own. Loved it! found it erotic as well!"
1,Poor Quality // Cut Scenes,"I like this movie but the DVD is awful. It's not letterbox, the ""wedding"" scene in the bedroom is cut, and the overall quality of the print is trash."
4,Strange movie,This movie is strange. Sort of a cross between a thiller and a S/M movie. Not one that most people would like and it should not be shown to Childern.
5,Great Shoes !,"My daughter loves these shoes. They are well made and a great price ! I compared these to the only local shoe store, Payless, that carries tap shoes. And these are much nicer, and cheaper. My daughter said these were more comfortable ! There sizing was right on ! When my daughter outgrows this pair, I'd definitely buy these same shoes..... Happy Dancing.. Happy feet !"
1,No support,"This battery is not an equivalent. It does not work with the Compaq Laptop that they say it will work with. Tested on 2 different (same model) laptops.Also, vendor does not respond to email."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book specifically because it had The Selfish Giant in it. I really wasn't interested in the rest of the stories very much. I was so disappointed when I read this version of The Selfish Giant, literally 5 small paragraphs, and it didn't even mention the little boy... who was obviously the whole point of the story. I understand that the author was trying to shorten the stories to make them easier for children, but I just don't think she did a very good job. I didn't even bother looking at the rest of the stories, I just packed up the book and sent it back."
4,A First Book of Fairy Tales,"at first I was a little disappointed, some of the tales were a little scary for a littleone, but the parents that I gave it to liked it.Julia"
5,fairy tales book,I RECEIVED THE BOOK IN RECORD TIME AND IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL BOOK. IT SHOULD SERVE A FAMILY OF TWO GIRLS QUITE NICELY FOR A LONG TIME. THANK YOU
3,the first book of fairy tales,"Too thick and not so convenient for reading to the child , pictures are good, but not great."
2,Few details in stories,"I purchased this book to read with my younger children as suggested by Sonlight. We were very disappointed with it. The illustrations are very nice, but the stories themselves are poorly told. The interesting details of the stories are left out. There are several fairy tale books in the Sonlight p 3/4 list... If you have limited funds, the ""Tall book of Nursery Tales"" is a much better pick. It is a great size for children and the stories are full of details."
5,Great for our 3-yr old,"all the stories are 2-6 pages, with lots of word, and some pretty pictures. A great variety of stories, and definitely tempered for a younger reader...i.e. minimal violence, death, etc."
4,Has Its Moments,"As withGet Away from Me, I'm finding that while the entire album is interesting, there are only a few songs here that will end up in ""heavy rotation"" at my house. ""Identity Theft"" is the track I enjoy the most, though it's also difficult to resist the charms of a Nellie McKay song called ""Zombie"". ""Oversure"", a jazzy cabaret number that features Bob Dorough on vocals, is also good fun, and the ""Don't Sleep in the Subway"" vibe of ""Gin Rummy"" is quite tasty, but I'm not sure I'll listen to them more than occasionally.Overall, my impression after a few listens is that McKay continues to be an interesting, talented artist, but one whose reach sometimes exceeds her grasp. Many of the songs here are over-orchestrated in a way that's more appropriate for a big production number, and I suspect that I'd enjoy them more if I heard her perform them live with a small ensemble. Here's hoping for a Nellie McKay live album."
3,It pains me to do this....but I must be honest,"I got to say I'm a little diappointed with this release. Get Away From Me was definatley one of the best albums of 2005, and Pretty Little head was a worthy follow up. My main complaint is that it's way too short. Compared to her other 2 albums, this thing is a damn tease!!! Don't get me wrong, there are some songs on here that I absolutley love. Which unfortunaely comes to 4 out of the 9. The other songs are good but not great in my opion. It really pains me to rate this so low(3.5 out of 5). Hopefully her next outing will be more rewarding."
3,Disappointing use of talent,"It is immediately evident that Nellie McKay has a great talent, and a sly, tongue-in-check sense of humour. Sadly, on this album most of that talent is wasted on dull, self-indulgent songs, a couple of which go so far as to be bad.The standout tracks, showing the promise of what the album COULD have been, are Mother of Pearl and Identity Theft. If she had recorded a full album of songs like these, the album would have been a true tour-de-force. As it is, it's a disappointing (and somewhat frustrating) let-down. Let's hope she'll demand a little more from herself on future efforts."
5,Oh...,"In some ways I felt like this series wrapped up too neatly, and in other ways I felt like it should have been more wrapped up. Oh well. Still a magnificent work of art combined with a compellings and intruiging story."
5,Book 3 review,"This was the last in a three part book of postcards between Sabine and Griffin.The art in the book is fabulous and it is a short read. One day. Can't put the book down.Some of the most impressive things are the actual envelopes with letters inserted that you must remove to read to continue with the book. At the end of this book however, everything I thought was happening was not confirmed and left me a bit concerned or confused. It had no clear ending.I loved these 3 books!!Sandie"
5,THE GREATEST BOOK EVER WRITTEN!!!!!,"I can't even begin to express how perfect this book is for anybody who has ever obsessed about their weight. Geneen knows all of the dieting and self-hatred downfalls, and this book has fifty simple remedies. Immediately after reading this book I felt an enormous change in my attitude towards myself and my body. I truly recommend it for everybody!"
4,"Well written, but a few quirks.","I did like the zen approach addressed through most of the book, but I wasn't keen on replacing eating with shopping. That can bring an entirely new set of issues with it."
5,"when you eat at the refrigerator, pull up a chair",I like it that this book is divided into short chapters so that I can read it when I have small bits of time.
2,you feel comfortable while reading it but it isn't covering every aspect of the problem,you feel comfortable while reading it but it isn't covering every aspect of the problem. you need to add another book to this one.
5,"Wise, Funny and Fabulous","Geneen's approach to eating is what I hope to embody: loving food but putting it in its proper place as a source of fuel and pleasure, but not a coping mechanism when I'm stressed or scared. She writes with honesty and wit, and her approach makes enormous sense to me. This book is divided into easily-readable chapters, and lately I find myself just opening it to any random chapter and reading what's before me: I always seem to get the insight I need at the moment."
4,Good and a different viewpoint for me,"Book was a good read, some I had heard before but new perspective too. Also humorous and encouraging."
5,all that,"i tried several substitutes for this item. some were ok but not satisfactory. so i happened to pass a gnc, so i inquired about their product. the clerk mentioned kyolic but only carried the store brand, which i purchased. it was better than all the others. when i needed more i figured i try the kyolic. i'm glad i did. it's all that it's advertised to be and has helped my health noticably. i just got more!"
4,I liked it,"I really like the quality of the picture. Only problem is it takes only two AA battery which dies quickly and also after taking one photo, you have to literally wait to take 2nd photo with flash on."
1,Good while it lasted,"My trusty A610 has just made the grand transformation from digital camera to paper weight. I turned it on today for the first time since September to photograph the snowy trees we've got in Seattle and found the LCD blacked out. At first I thought I had just accidentally turned the LCD itself off and took a few pictures through the optical viewfinder. However, when I hooked it up to my computer I was able to see that the pictures themselves were black. Bad CCD, apparently, and not the first of its kind to go bad.Black Screen Of Death. I expect to be in contact with Canon soon about a repair, and I also expect them to tenaciously hold to their $107 repair fee. I don't know if I'll be buying any more Canon products - I suppose its up to their service center at this point."
4,I'm happy,"I'm pleased with this camera. It takes pretty good pictures. I think the learning curve is a bit steep though. I still haven't been able to eliminate the red-eye problem entirely, even though I'm sure I've played with every setting imaginable. If you buy one of these, get a good case for it. My zoom lever popped off and I had to send it in to Canon. Canon fixed it, as it was still under warranty. I'm happy to say that their customer service handled my issue very well."
1,Died for no reason after only 16 months.,The title is self explanatory.Just like others here my camera died no pictures and no screen after few time I used.Never dropped or abused.It is a lemon form Canon.Gio.
1,Great camera...when it doesn't die suddenly,"Awesome camera, quick, and just easy to use. I did tons of research on it when I purchased it in Feb '06. Unfortunately, if you start looking at some of the more recent reviews, you can see that folk that got it around a year ago are having major issues.Mine's no exception, and amazingly, this is first piece of hardware that's actually failed me. Quite an experience and interesting to see that many others are having the same issue as me: a LCD screen that's black and an inability to take pictures.And like a previous poster said, Canon's taking responsibility for a bunch of other models but not this one yet. You can read the notice on their website after navigating through their digital camera support section.So all in all, it was nice...while it lasted. Hope things are better now."
1,Another one bites the dust,"Wow, so I'm not alone in my $150 purchase of a camera that lasts 16 months? Thanks everyone, misery loves company.For my camera, I was taking photos when i put my finger in front of the lens when i zoomed out. All of a sudden I get error code ""E18"" (obstructed lens) and my camera is DEAD. I'm out of Canon warranty, I didnt get Bestbuy's warranty, and the local repair shop wants $65 minimum to 'take a look'.....betwen my own lens problem and all of the other published problems on this camera, I dont want to invest more money in a lemon. I am now seriously concerned for the quality of all canon cameras and I dont CARE how popular they are, Once burned, you learn your lesson, I'll go for Sony next time.I really LOVED this camera while it lasted which is the sad part. I hate Canon and I do hold a grudge. They lost a customer forever. An electronic product should not be this shoddy."
3,Blurry photos and camera shake icon won't go away,"I am giving this 3 stars for now because I have just ordered a replacement and don't want to slam the camera in case I just happened to get a ""bad"" one. I previously had the Canon A80 and was always pleased with the results so I opted for the A610 when it was time to get a new camera. Out of the box, I set the camera to Auto and started shooting a few indoor shots and noticed that all the shots seemed blurry. Additionally, the camera shake icon comes on when using the optical zoom no matter how still the camera is held. I even set the camera on a table to ensure that it was completely still but I can't get the camera shake icon to go away (any suggestions?). Based on my good experiences with the A80 and after reading all the good reviews posted, I have decided that the camera must be defective in some way so I am sending it back to Amazon for a replacement."
1,shake...shake..shake,"I want to echo the review by Johnny Damon: ""Features and functionality are very nice, but I cannot get a single sharp image; pictures are all blurry and noisy no matter what setting i use. Like the previous reviewer, I also get the camera shake icon way too often."" Everything else is great but because this simple defect is inadmissible, I'll give it 1 star only!"
1,Not a good deal,"There are many features and controls on this. But what is the point of this rich feature set on a camera that basically takes junkier pictures (on automatic) than my old Sony DSC-S30? The AE (autoexposure) frames still manage to expose my pictures wrong. The Sony with no such ""feature"" never got it wrong. The colors on the A610 are muddy and grey, not vivid. I have to take 5 pix to get enough coverage for one of them to be in-focus. pathetic. And the ""camera shake"" icon is the default state of this thing. What is the point of making a camera that uses it's technology to 'helpfully' tell you it can't take your pictures 70 percent of the time?This thing goes through non-rechargeable batteries like nobody's business.Not a good camera. Not a good deal."
2,horrible software,Camera is nice and take good pics. But never install the software. It doesn't work and screws up your computer...
4,Buena relación Precio Valor.,"De verdad que la experiencia con la nueva camara a sido genial, la fotos son execelentes, los videos de 640x480 a 30 fps son geniales, para sacarle provecho es recomendable una memoria de 1 gb, entre lo que no me gusto fue el software para el PC ya que te abliga a bajar la fotos con este y no detecta la memoria como una unidad de disco, pero si tienes card reader problema resuelto, el otro detalle es la tapita donde esta la entrada de A/V es como fragil pareciera que se fuese a partir debieron hacerla igual a la de la memoria que es excelente.la recomiendo con los ojos cerrados.saludos."
3,Disappointed,"I bought this camera for my digital photography class thinking that it would be a great investment and turned out to be wrong. Dont get me wrong it has many features, but after two months into my semester my camera pooped out on me. It slowed down. It will take forever to take a shot or focus. Also it is way to heavy to take photos without a tripod you will end up with many blurred photos. So now I am looking for a lighter camera with an imagae stablilizer."
2,Buyer beware: red-eye consistent in indoor pictures,"Buyer beware! red-eye will be present in majority of indoor photos. Even with the red-eye reduction and indoor modes ""on""; red-eye is present in pictures. If the flash goes off expect RED-EYE in the picture. For $300 - one should expect better results. It's inconvenient and time consuming to manually edit many red-eye pictures. The edited red-eye pictures either still have some red-eye or the eye appears black. On Amazon - I have read reviews that Kodak models have solved the red-eye issue. Learn from my $300 buying mistake."
1,You are rolling the dice if you buy this camera! stay away!,"This camera does take great shots, but the reliability of it stinks. We enjoyed it for a year and then the battery low warning came on even with brand new batteries... others are complaining of the same thing. It is a $200 disposable camera, and canon knows it!"
1,Nice Pictures...watch out for the black screen,"There's no better warning to be made other than saying the camera is great, until you get the ""black screen"". Canon choosing not to acknowledge the issue and repair the defective cameras for little to no cost, is unfortunate."
4,a very good choice when I bought it,untill it got stollen I was quite pleased it did a very good job for me took over 2 thousand pics the zoom was a little less that I wanted but it is adequate with in 100 ft the movies were ok
1,Dead as a doornail,"I'm travelling for several months, and lo and behold, the camera will not power up. I've had it for a year and a half, which seems to be the end of life for this model."
1,Canon Powershot A610 5MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom,"Very unreliable camera, since we bought this camera last December, the camera has been sent back to Canon three times for problems. The basic issue was that it did not take pictures. Each time, Canon fixed and sent camera back. For the third time, we requested a replacement because we believed that the camera was a lemon. The camera was out of commission for 4+ months out of the 12 month warranty for repair and transit time."
4,pretty good,"I bought this camera last month & till now it worked just fine. I have only one complaint. When i try to take a picture in night mode, i need to keep the camera real steady or else u will get a shaky pic."
4,Moonlighter,The camera surpasses my wildest dreams. It it a very easy camera to use. It is also easy to downloan. Anybody who orders this camere is in for a very pleasent surprise.
4,"Great camera, small problem","The camera arrived quickly and looked great. However, when trying to actually use it a problem popped up. It appears the camera had been taken apart and when reassembled the navigation button had not been properly seated. This made using the arrow keys, especially going left was next to impossible. The problem has been fixed, the camera works beautifully and I'm very pleased with it. Also the Amazon seller Ztron provided excellent customer service. Thanks for an experience that turned out really good!"
1,Dead Screen,"I will admit the camera took great pictures but from the very beginning I had issues. When it was very cold the shutter would not open completely, sometimes I had to open the battery door and close it to get it to power up. Then came the dreaded blank screen. I contacted Cannon and received the typical $110 up front answer. I will continue to argue with them and try to get a reduced price or free if I can but I'm not holding my breath. I took excellent care of this camera but is still died after about 28 months of use. I still have a 25 year old Pentax camera that works like the day I bought it, why can't they make anything that last now days?"
1,Recurring theme...,"Like so many that have commented, after owning this camera for about 15 months it stopped taking pictures. The monitor still works since I can view the old pictures on memory, but the camera will no longer capture a new picture. Avoid this camera!"
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!,I bought one of these and in a few months it crashed and I lost all the data. Unfortunately for me I lost my receipt and the manufacturer wouldn't fix it without it costing me roughly the same amount that a new one cost. Be warned: STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!
3,SmartDisk XF120F External 120 GB USB 2.0 & FireWire 7200 RPM,"Received package in 2 days (free shipping) wow!!! Very easy to install on my imac 9.0 machine. Now I have triple plus space on my machine. Since I have 2 open firewire ports, I just plugged the firewire cable into the imac. Version 9.0 requires installation of software. So far, so good."
4,"Really, the soundtrack is much better than the movie!","I am a big Nsync fan, so of course when this movie came out, I had to go and see it. Well, it was a little disappointing, Joey was pretty funny but Lance's acting was less than spectactular to say the least. But this review is for the soundtrack, which is actually very good. There is a little bit of everything for everyone. You have your Nsync and Britney songs but there is also that great new version of ""Let's Get Together"" by Al Green. This is one of the few cd's that you can listen to all the way through without hitting the next button on your cd player."
4,Good pop music cd,"I bought this cd today because I'm a big fan of nsync, and I wanted the new songs. The best songs are 1 - On the Line, 7 - Falling, and 3 - I'll be under you. A good CD if your a fan of any of the artists on it, especially if your an NSYNC fan!"
4,On the Line and Out of the Station,"Granted, I had some, okay several, misgivings about this album. Until I saw the preview during a sneak preview of ""Serendipity."" And once I heard the music used in the film, I knew I had to have this soundtrack. And other thanthe Britney Spears song, she wrote it???, the album is really very good. Trust me. The 'N Sync songs are good, the On the Line All-Stars are good, Joey Fatone's solo is good (who knew that he had such a smooth, silky voice and kept that hidden?) and I LOVE Kessica Folker's song. Buy the album! As for the film, well, I'll leave that up to you, but the album is definitely a keeper!"
3,Teenybopper soundtrack,"I got this cd as a present from my mom (back when N*Sync was ""cool"") a while ago, and at the time, it was pretty good. Joey Fatone has a great voice and is very good on ""Ready To Fall"", but the REAL highlight is Richie Sambora. I personally am still listening to this cd for that one song and it's the only reason I gave it three stars (three times better than any other song on this cd!!!). The rest (Britney, BBMak, N*Sync) is just the soundtrack to the perky life of the teenybopper ...Unless you're a die-hard rock fan like me (who worships Bruce Springsteen and Bon Jovi), skip it."
3,Doesn't Have the Best Songs From The Movie,"The film's best songs were the ones that Joey sang in the bar at the beginning, a remake of Def Leppard's ""Pour Some Suger On Me"" and the hauntingly beautiful ""Kevin Crapped Out All Alone.""Since this album does not have those songs I will probably not get it. Too bad, because I am a big Joey Fatone fan."
4,On The L...........I..........N............E!!!!,"I recently bought this cd and have not been able 2 stop playing it! I'm not a huge fan of pop music, but this definatly caught my ears! The title song- On The Line is very cute. It's video is even better. Lots of familiar pop faces on this song, and the cd too. I love this record! Anyone who is willing to try new music, or even old pop fans will truly enjoy ON THE LINE!!!! I promise, you'll never take it out of your cd player!~!~!~!~"
5,Best in a while!,"This has to be my new favorite CD, it has something for everyone. It's got new songs from both Britney and NSYNC, a little country thanks to Meredith Edwards, and some amazing new artists whose CDs I want to get now - Melissa Lefton & Jessica Folker. Not to mention a version of Ready To Fall sang entirly by Joey Fatone - if NSYNC ever broke up he'd have a definate solo career. If you like a CD that picks up your mood and makes you want to dance, then I highly suggest this."
5,Not so boyband album!!!,"Ok so *Nsync does have two songs on the album, but I assure you that you will find this soundtrack very refreshing and uplifting. With the resurection of a popular Al Green song mid-way thru the album, and a surprizingly talented solo from Joey Fatone, I found myself singing along after only the second round of listening. It's a perfect car-toons CD or something to get you through the work day. A nice mix of new and popular artists, including Lance Bass's protege Meredith Edwards that sings the country version of the solo Joey Fatone introduces. I highly recomend this soundtrack to round out your collection. And buying it on Amazon will save you buck$! I unfortunately bought it ""discounted"" at a major everything store and still paid more than Amazon."
4,This is a great album for fans of all types of music!,"I really enjoyed this album. It's got two great new songs by Nsync and the title song is very catchy. I love it also that such a wide range of artists are included on the album, like BBMak, Britney, Al Green and even the Christan band True Vibe. Joey Fatone's solo song, Ready To Fall, blew me away! What a great chance to hear is ""real"" voice, out from behind the Nsync harmonies (which are also great, as always). However, as the album goes along, the artists are unrecognizable and the songs don't stick with you as much. But Meredith Edward's country version of ""Ready to Fall"" makes up for the wait. I recommend this CD to all Nsync fans who want to broaden thier musical tastes!"
1,Do I even need to explain?,"There are basically two reasons the movie was bad enough (and their names are Lance and Joey) just as there are two reasons not to buy this (and their names are *NSYNC and Britney). An almost ironic choice to put on the soundtrack of a film starring two boy band members- opposing boy bands! What brainiac thought this up, anyway? Filled with all the singers I hate most in the world, the disc proves itself a credit to idiocy everywhere. We have not heard from Blaque in how many years and suddenly they reappear (thankfully only on here). Vitamin C's laughable attempt at keeping her career up has been fun to watch but is exceedingly painful to listen to on ""Do You C what I C."" Joey Fatone goes solo with ""Ready to Fall,"" which is croaked out so badly, it would remind one of those Budwieser Frogs. And the rest is filled with nobodies and has-beens who simply won't go away.I would not buy this CD under any circumstance."
2,Not the best soundtrack.,I did not really like this CD. The only songs I liked on the CD were the two Nsync songs and the one that Joey Fatone sings. I think he sounds great. I thought it would have been better.
2,Not what I expected.,"I ordered them thinking I'd be receiving kit kats that matched the picture. I thought it would be perfect for my husbands birthday party, as kit kats are his favorite and the colors were white/black. But I received a box of regular kit kats that I could have purchased cheaper at a gas station. Just feel a little mislead that the product picture is NOT what they are selling."
2,Boring,"This book was a bit boring. I found that my professor had to add a lot of information beyond the book's description of styles of articles. I am not a journalism major, but rather took the course as part of an English minor.The book tried to convince the reader that journalism was an important, noble profession. Anyone interested in journalism would already feel that way."
5,"Goodnight, dear monster!",I recently purchased a copy of this book for my two nieces. My nieces are ages 4 and 7. They really enjoyed this book and they love the pictures. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that has young kids. I am sure they will enjoy reading this book.
3,"The very worst, but a lot of fun","This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen with a great cast. It's a ton of fun, it's super colorful, great characters, and has a beautiful musical score so if you can handle a stinker of a movie, it's a must-see. Straight out of the '50's Hollywood classic adventures and I love every minute of it. It would be great on Blue Ray.A movie that's truly worth watching... just watch it with a sense of humor and enjoy the color, music, and the fun of watching a kinda funky movie.BTW, there's one shot of Rex Harrison's stand-in riding one of the most beautiful chestnut horses I've ever seen. A beautiful, shiny copper coat with four white sox."
2,The Talisman - 50's Hollywood style,"Well, the film didn't follow the book but that's not surprising. This was an obvious B- movie for the masses. I did enjoy watching Rex Harrison ham it up as Saladin, he obbviously had a good time with the part. Virginia Mayo was gorgeous, Laurence Harvey was stiff/predictable, and George Sanders was a disappointing King Richard. Although acting like the real King Richard would be tough for most hollywood actors in the 50's. The close-up horse-riding scenes were silly (moving background - static horse) and the battle scenes were lame. The jousts were OK and the desert dune scene was fun. All-in-all it was what I expected from a low budget 50's flick.djb"
2,High-priced junk,"Big budget doesn't always mean quality. The producers of this movie had plenty of money to spend to make this picture. However, it should stand as an example of how not to make a picture. Talents of a big-name cast are abused and wasted; this film is filled to the brim with lousy overacting. Also, the screenplay is not very historically accurate. Most viewers would probably stop and rewind the tape before seeing very much of this movie. If you watch this film on television, you'll probably change the channel to see what else is on."
2,"Dumb, Dumb, DUMB","They couldn't have miscast this film even worse if they'd tried.I nearly collapsed from laughter. Don't watch it for history,great acting, costumes, or sets. And lose the popcorn. Youdon't want to choke between giggles!"
4,no need to carry your laptop,"Wonderful program. Maximizer link 5 sets up very easily and offers a very detailed manual to assist in the event of any difficulties. The program works seamlessly with Maximizer 5. The only short coming is the manner in which palm handles notes and to do's. Any number of Maximizer notes and to do's can be attached directly to a contact, however Palms' address book only permits ONE note to be synchronized with a contact. Through the use of what maximizer calls ""keys"" you can link a to do or note to a contact and it seems to work quite well. It would be better if notes where linked to a contact by the Palm address book. Great program highly recommend it."
3,"Not Definitive, But a Good Counterbalance.","This book is the perfect counterbalance to Ray Coleman's hilariously fawning autohrized biography, ""Clapton.""Coleman's and Sanford's books are polar opposites in the treatment of the subject and somehere between the two extremes a fairly good picture of Clapton emerges.If you seek objectivity, read this one first. It is a harsher, more detached, yet no less accurate, assesment of his life and musical influence.If you are a Clapton fan seeking to reenforce your perception of, ""Clapton as God"", read Coleman's book."
2,Terrible biography,"I admit from the outset that I am a longtime Clapton fan. I have read just about every book and magazine article written about him over the last 30 years and have viewed many of the video bios about him. This book is by far the worst. It seems to me that the author had a negative bias from the beginning.Clapton is no saint and his past is what it is. Nevertheless, it appears that the author interviewed only those people who had a grudge or bone to pick. From the rather unflattering cover picture to his reviews of EC's work this biography is nothing more than an anti-Clapton diatribe. Even his compliments are backhanded. Sanford's claim that he ""came to have a quite genuine and deep sympathy for [Clapton]"" rings very hollow. He seems to have found every reason to trash the man and the majority of his work.Those interested in a balanced view should avoid this book."
3,Edge of Believability,"For Clapton fans a must, but the trite & unsubstantiated narrative made me feel at times like was reading the National Enquirer (Do I really need to read rumors about Clapton sleeping with Jagger -- NO!) Of course as a Clapton fan (especially of work with Cream and Dominos) I couldn't put the book down - what it lacks in historical & musical perspective it more than makes up for in juicy gossip! The Shapiro bio is considerably better, but the fact remains that the definitive work on this incredibly talented and complex man has not yet been written!"
1,long road nowhere,"Lots of details of Eric's life...too many for most readers. Author is British, and the writing is not edited for American audiences. The content is not always believable, and some author's opinions are repeated, and repeated."
2,J a Rule- Pain Is Love,"ok i'm a pretty picky music person, this cd is pretty good, but not worth 15 dollars, i put two stars because only 40 percent of the cd is good. i don't put 5 stars becuase of one song. ""Livin It Up'"" is alright but ""I'm Real"" was good but i haate j lo she has no musical talent what so ever. and she even tries to rap. but this isn't the greatest cd of all time. trust me if someone says it is the best cd. tell them to listen to more music"
2,How Could You Do This To Me Ja???,"Ja Rule, Ja Rule I am so disappointed. Why did I fall into the trap of buying this album? Why did I spend my (money) for this album? I gave this album 2 stars because I like 3 or maybe 4 of the songs on this album, that includes: I'm Real w/can't sing to save her life J.lo, Always On Time, Livin' It Up and some other song. I shoulda just bought another copy of Jay-Z's Blueprint, DMX or something, that's how bad this album is to me. I was really feeling Ja's previous songs before this album, but this album does those songs no justice. He needs to go back into the studio and come correct. Next time I will wait more time and hear many songs before I ever buy another Ja Rule album."
2,why in the hell is he b!tching up.,theres nothing wrong in making thought provoking lyrics but man if this isn't watered down rap or what?.theres some tracks on here don't get me wrong but damn its too comercial for me.
2,Ashamed,"I am ashamed that Ja Rule even atempted to remake the Tupac classic ""pain"". The original was a classic anthem for everything that Tupac stood for, and was a tight song. The remix however leaves a lot to be desired. The beat is wack, the background vocals are worse, and the whole idea of an east coast raper redoing a Tupac song is messed up. Other that the pain re-mix, this album is aight."
5,Don't confuse real music wit rap beefs,"I read some of these reviews and I felt like to need to set this straight. My statement is: don't judge da musik by who the artist is having beef with. Just because Ja Rule is beefing wit the Shady Camp, doesn't mean he has no talent or is a wanna-be. Rule got real talent wit a real New York flow, admit it. Just listen to this album! It's hot! You shouldn't hate on Ja Rule because of his beef. Music talent and beef are two seperate things.Now I need to make myself clear: I luv Shady Records/50 Cent/Eminem, but I also luv The INC/Ja Rule! That's right, you heard what I said! I think both camps have real hot rappers wit real talent. If they would just quit the beef and collaborate, they would rock the rap game, and the rap world would have no more space for other rappers anymore. Believe this statement. This is from da heart. Holla back!"
2,What went wrong???,"Im very disapointed with this album. Ja changed from his ""Murda"" stlye rap to this ""pop"" rap. Its disgusting. His first single with J-Lo ""Im real"" is just his way of making an extra dollar. ""Livin it up"" is another cheasy single. ""Always on Time"" (his third single) Im pretty sure nobody even liked. His best song is ""Dial M for murder"" and even for Ja it's pretty weak."
5,Pain Is Love,"In my opinion this album is Ja's best one yet, proven by being the #1 album in the country the first week it was released. I think Ja is one of the best rappers out and this Pain Is Love album is just a piece of what he has in store for his fans in the future. So as a lolyal fan of Ja Rule and as a member of the Murder Inc. Online Street Team I encourage everyone to buy this album!"
2,Commercial rap at its worst,"Pain is love is nothing more then soft, weak rhymed commercial hip hop. Ja went from being gangsta on Venni Vetti Vecci to a trl/pop novelty for suburban kids everywhere. Now there is talk that he is going to do a song with metallica. Kiss his career goodbye he will definately fade fast.Hes been way too over exposed.Besides how do you go from making street records with memphis bleek to rock records with metallica. what a damn shame"
2,what happened ja,"Ja Rule is a great artist, don't get me wrong but he goes soft.I love hardcore rap, but if u do too do not buy this album. If u like romantic and soft melody songs this is the one for u! Best song is Livin it Up."
2,Ja goes softer and softer,"This is what I expected from Ja. He became weak (even wack). His sophomore effort ""Rule 3:36"" was weaker than his debut and this one is straight up b.s. He became a R&B-pop star on this album. His ""Venni vetti vecci"" was almost a classic release but this one is plain weak. I hate to say that 'cause I respected him but now... I don't know... I decided not to buy it. Ja you must go back to your roots! This is WEAK!Told: 2-stars."
5,RULE BABY!,"WOW!! THE RULE KEEPS GETTIN BETTA AND BETTA!!!! For any Ja Rule fan, this cd is a MUST. With hit songs on it like I'm Real (feat. J.Lo), Always on Time (feat. Ashanti), So Much Pain (feat. Tupac), Down A** B**ch (feat. Charli Baltimore), X (feat. Missy Elliott and Tweet), etc. you can't go wrong!! But i must warn y'all, if u get offended easily (by swearing) you might wanna reconsider...he has quite a foul mouth on him. But don't most rappers? Besides, if u really wanna buy the cd but don't like all the cussin, then buy the edited/clean version!!!Well gotta go.RULE BABY---IT'S MURDA 4 LIFE"
1,CONSISTENTLY HORRIBLE,"You gotta give the man credit- no one can be this bad, this distingusting, and this wasteful on such a regular basis. Ja had one good album, his first, and ever since,he has shown steadily that he is only getting worse. Lock your doors."
2,"What the hell? Quit foolin' around, Ja.","I didn't like this album much. The album starts off pretty good, but then goes another direction and goes back where it started and so forth. Track 2, Dial M For Murda, shows his raspy hardcore type rapping. Then it suddenly turns when Track 3,Livin It Up, starts. The next song is not bad. Then it goes to the dumbest songs, Always On Time w/ Ashanti, and Down Ass B***h w/ Charlie Baltimore. Worldwide Gangsta is one of the best songs in the album, and is the next track. The song is a freestyling type song with Black Child, Cadillac Tah, Boo & Gotti. After that, the album goes all the way down to the lowest it can possibly go. The only songs I like in this album are:Dial M For Murda, Worldwide Gangsta, and So Much Pain w/ 2Pac.If I were you, I would buy ""Venni, Vetti, Vecci"", Ja's first album, instead of this one."
2,this album ain't that good,"this album has a few alright songs but the song so much pain where ja rule tries to rap like the legend 2pac, he sounds like a little punk kid pretending to be a thug."
5,this cd is tight,Yo ne1 b hatin on dis jam dunno wat real music is. for real dis cd is tight got ill beats and tight songs. Definitly a cd 2 watse paper on. Holla!
4,Ja Rule is back.,"Ja Rule is back and he is livin' large on this cd. It has some excellent tracks on it. So with that in mind, here is the track list for Ja Rule's album called ""Pain Is Love"". Thanks!Track List:Track 1: Pain Is Love (Skit)Track 2: Dial M For MurderTrack 3: Livin' It UpTrack 4: The IncTrack 5: Always On TimeTrack 6: Down A** B**chTrack 7: Never AgainTrack 8: Worldwide Gangsta'Track 9: Leo (Skit)Track 10: I'm Real (Murder Remix)Track 11: Smokin' And Ridin'Track 12: XTrack 13: Big Remo (Skit)Track 14: Lost Little GirlTrack 15: So Much PainTrack 16: Pain Is LoveThanks for reading my review. I hope you like it. Thanks.WARNING: Dear Parents: As you may notice, this album contains EXPLICIT CONTENT and LYRICS. Please think before letting kids 15 and under, listen to this album. Must be, at least, 16 and over to listen. Thanks."
5,BACK AT TOP,"Ja Rule did it. He made a great album, I didn't know what o expect because I wasn't a fan of I'M Real with J-Lo but the album is great especially dial M for Murder that has some great guitar in in the song, and the Intro is dark, and sort of depressing.Ja Rule has rapping voice that sounds just like DMX.Good job Ja. Keep the hits coming."
5,Ja never stops,I own this cd and have had it since October 2nd. This CD is still murderous entwined with so much thug love. I gave it 5 stars because I can put my player on random and not be disappointed at what song plays next.
1,Jarule in not a good lyricist,"This cd is the cd that made me stop Bumpin', Ja'. It is so comercial (i'm not hatin' on commercial artists)that every song is all bout ""Ashanti & Rule"", it is pathetic. I like Ja's last two records but this is c[garbage]. Stay Away....."
5,great cd,i love this cd. so much pain is the best rap song ever. the rest is great. the only song i hate is x. but i also hate missy elliot
1,pain is love,this album is lame in every aspect as a matter of fact none of his albums make the grade he attempts to combine r&b with hip hop which equals one wack combination every song on this album isbelow average avoid this and every other ja rule album out there period
2,Worst R&B album of the yeat,"Nothing on this CD is worth listening to...Ja RUle Does have a dope singing voice...THe former Murderous MC is now a R&B cat...the only people who would like this cd are girlies....for real....He is the cat who is responsible for J Lo sayin the ""n"" word....thats enough right there to revoke is rappin card.."
1,Pain to my ears more like it!,Whoa man talk about the worst albums off ALL time! Ja Rule was tight in his first album and wasn't going pop like he is now. This album is pure junk so if you really want to hear good stuff get something like Nas or get some other stuff thats REAL rap. Not this junk. I would give a -5 if it were available!
3,disapointing,"Rule tryed to hard to appeal to the main stream pop stuff in this album. theres too many slow songs that dont really sound right coming from him. Livin it up is really good and the song with 2 Pac is sick, but past that there isn't really alot that is really solid, Rule is better when he raps fast and hard like he did alot in 3:36"
5,Ja rule keeps puttin it on us,Ja Rule keeps making hot hits after hot hits and Pain is Love is another one. The only thing i dont like is the constant songs with a female singer singing the chorus. Its just now getting a little old and too routine. Butother than that Pain is Love is a good cd
2,review from a tru 2pac fan,"Alright, this is how it is. I have listened 2 this cd and i have 2 say that ja is a dmx/2pac clone at best. the only good thing about this cd is ""so much pain"". that gives it the extra star, simply because of the fact that 2pac (the greatest of all time) is on this. other than that, ""always on time"" is so overplayed i cant turn on the radio without hearing it. look ja, no one, repeat no one has ever or will ever come close to 'Pac's greatness. dont think that putting this remake of ""pain"" (by the way the original is probably the tightest 2pac song ever) makes ya hard or more of a thug. quit putting jlo in your songs, it only softens them even more. I have to say that ""holla,holla"" is the song that made me a ja fan, then 336 came out and he just plain [stank]. so much pain is a ok remake, but he just cant come close to 2pac and stretch(other guy in the original song)emotion. all in all, ja might be able 2 flow, but quit thinking your 2pac. ONE"
3,"Ok if you are a fan, won't gain new ones","Often going to the well for the same type of songs and raps which has made him rich and successful, but if you are looking for an evolving artist, keep hoping."
2,It's Official,"Ot's official. Ja Rule went soft. I thought the song with Tupac was going to be hott. It was.....Until Ja got on the mic. Completely tryna be like Pac. I couldn't take it. If this album were more like the Venni Vetti Veche album, it would be ok. But he went soft. Those songs are garbage. Throw it out. It had a few good beats on there and Tupac was nice as usual on it. Ja trying to sing really messes it up a lot. If he want a singer, he should go out and sign a singer from the streets to his label. Ja, give up on the singing. Please~!! For the sake of Hip Hop please stop singing. Only certain people like Bone, and people who's voices can be fixed with the modern day studio technology can sing. After that song with Pac, Ja just lost a lot of cool points with me. That's the word."
1,Let's see...,"I liked this guy better back when he didn't have the bandana, didn't sing, didn't work with j lo, oh, my bad, that's dmx, silly me."
1,Why do people buy this?????,"Ja Rule(along with Nelly and others on MTV,BET) represent everything that is wrong with the rap industry today. They abandon all integrity in order to make some $$$. This album is a perfect example. Please do not support these ignorant fools!."
5,Now Thats What I Call Hot!!!,JaRules new CD is cool! Me and my friends party to this songs all the time! We think he is so hot! I what to meet him so bad!JaRule rocks the world.Well got to go!
1,Pain is not love,"I hate to see this type of thing happen to an MC. I rated Ja Rule as one of my top five rappers back when his first album Venni, Vetti, Vecci came out. I was really excited when the second one dropped. I ran out to buy it only to be disappointed.I could barely listen to half of the LP. I don't mind when someone changes their flow a little bit, but when you are trying to sing along with the vocalists it just doesn't work. Especially when you have a voice like Ja's. His third effort has even less playability in my system. There is only one song that I would even consider playing, which is Dial M for Murder. So if you liked the second effort, you might even have to think about buying this one. My suggestion is to stay away."
2,It ...[stinks]!!!!!,"I couldn't listen the entire album...I listened half of it and it ...[stinks]!! Ja Rule disapointed me on this one...It's more and R&B; CD than a hardcore one. From a guy who's bragged 'bout been a thug, and was on a album called ""The Murderers"" he changed a lot.By the way, the production provided by Irv Gotti ...[stinks] too..."
1,ITS OFFICIAL JA HAS SOLD OUT,"DO NOT GET THIS ALBUM. Ja Rule has evovled and grown into the one of the if not the worst rapper/singer/whatever he wants to do. This album is filled with guests it shows he can't carry himself all alone, to make matters worse each track almost sounds the same. All he does is sing, and talk about women and nothing, and rip the late great 2Pacs style. Ja Rule needs to rap or not represent rap at all. Lyrics are terrible, the beats are tolerable, but you can tell it was strickly made for radio and selling. He has finally sold out, and Ja theres no coming back when you leave the streets they don't want you back, I wish you would retire today."
3,Well!,"To tell you the truth, I hate rap! This album, I wouldn't buy, and I've only heard a few song, so I don't change my mind about him, cause right now, I like him. His songs are pretty good, like Ain't It Funny(Remix) and the I'm Real(Remix) with Jennifer Lopez were pretty good. Always On Time and Living It Up are pretty good songs as well! I don't think I could listen to the whole album, but a few rap songs here and there, aren't bad. I like him the best! He rules!!"
3,NO GOOD SONGS,"This CD is pure pop. He sings in all of the songs accpet for smokin and riding, and dial M for murder. And dmfm is the ONLY good song on this cd. Its not worth buying. Just take ur frends and rip that 1 song onto your computer. If u like pop though, then buy this. If u expect rap, then get dmx or eminem."
4,THE HOLLIS STAR,"I like everything that Ja Rule puts out. I rate this album4 stars because it's good but not as good as 3:36. To me itfeels that he really expressed alot of himself growing upand alot of hardships in life. It felt like he was giving a message rather than entertainment. Now he still expresses hisselfbut it seems a bit less of himself. And that's what i feel ismost admired by his audience. That's what draws me to his musicbeing i'm from the same place as him (Hollis Queens). Well ilike this album but I feel that he could've done a little betterin expressing hisself, on the account of the things that's out there."
2,2pac is rolling over in his grave,"Ja rule is ok,but he copies 2pac so much,and it doesn't help any re making so much pain all it does it make Ja look really bad.Also he tries to sing,and it's annoying as hell,he has gone so soft lately so not only is he a pac biter,but a comercialized pac biter.If you like Ja Rule in venni vitti vicci,you'll hate this,peace."
3,"Good effort, just hoped for more.","While Ja Rule definitely has the voice and talent to become one of today's top artists, this latest effort falls somewhat short of my high expectations. The album has some definite highs(""Livin' It Up"", ""Lost Little Girl"", ""Dial M For Murder"", ""Never Again""), but lacks the consistency to be a great album. A few of the tracks are better skipped over including the skit titled ""Leo."" The duet with JLo(""I'm Real"") is catchy, but almost to the point of being annoying so. This being said, if you are a fan of Ja's gravely vocals, this is worth having in your car for a laid back evening drive down the boulevard."
1,Im lauging so hard I might have a heart attack,"This guy thinks he's a thug? Please. I heard ""So Much Pain"" the song with 2Pac, and I considered buying this, but I heard the whole cd and I almost threw up. Look Ja, 2Pac is the greatest rapper that ever lived or ever will live. You, on the other hand, are nowhere near him. Pain is one of the best songs 2Pac ever recorded, and although I have to say Ja did do a good job of remixing the song and the way he brought 'Pac into the song was tight, man, COME UP WITH YOUR OWN LYRICS! He took 2Pacs lyrics and re-worded them just a little. If you want the real song, buy the cassette version of the Above The Rim soundtrack, but I couldnt find it so I got it off the internet. Ja, pain is not love, pain is watching your garbage a$$ videos and hearing your pop songs every time I turn on the radio. If you know and appreciate real rap, then you wont buy this. You'll buy, of course, 2Pac,then Geto Boys, Scarface, Biggie, NWA, Nas, and so on. Dont buy this. Peace."
2,good but lost the strength of previous albums,Ja Rule is a fantastic rapper with lyrics on par with Dr Dre or DMX and with a style similar to DMX. His first album was very hard and rocked. His second album while equally hard and following the same style was more along the hip-hop lines.This album however reverses the previous mix of 80% hard core music and 20% R&B/hip-hop to something akin to 20% hard coreand 80% R&B/Hip-Hop music. There are a *few* good tracks butif you were expecting anything close to Rule 3:36 then you'llhave a serious let down. The best song on the album is probablythe duet with J-Lo. (yes - I hate her too!!) :(Ja Rule Rocks but this album sucks like a tornado in comparisonto his previous work.
5,Great purchase!,Great purchase and item was delivered on time and in the condition as described by the seller.
3,"Better than 3:36, but that's nothing to be proud of.","On this album Ja Rule continues his R&B fetish so he can continue to sell records. But he also mixes in some more hardcore tracks so he can try to regain his street credibility. I just don't respect that, sorry Ja but you can't have it both ways. There are a few good tracks, but most of it is R&B/Pop garbage. And what really makes me mad is that 2pac (my favorite rapper of all time) is on this album. I wouldn't mind if Pac was on ""Venni, Vetti, Vecci"", but putting him on this near-wack album is a disgrace. So, if you liked ""Rule 3:36"" then you'll like this too, but if want real hardcore rap check out Ja's first album."
1,PAINFUL TO LISTEN TO.,"This guy has as much credibility and talent as poop diddy has,which is by the way none.Ja fool,poop diddy and nelly represent everything which is wrong with hip hop today.All the songs sound the same and have the same ridiculous gangster lyrics to them.His voice annoys the hell out of me and his face just makes me laugh.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS."
2,[bad],"This is the first time i bought a ja rule cd, and it will definitely be my last. i bought cuz i know it had some songs i liked like ""living it up"", ""im real"" and ""always on time"" from the radio. thing is, pretty much every other song on the cd is garbage, all filler songs clearly put in just so there would be enough tracks (smokin and ridin should not fall under the category of a song it is so bad). some of the hits i mentioned above are good, but the cd as a whole is terrible and just shows how greedy an artist can be."
3,"some good songs,but most suck","Theres not much to say bout this cd.It sucks except for a few songs.The skits suck,especially the leo skit.If u want a ms.cleo spoof,buy busta rhymes's genesis (great cd).I would just buy a used one instead of payin full price for only a couple songs.TOP 5=(the only good songs)Dial M For Murder,Livin It Up,The Inc,Never Again"
2,...,"This is the first time i bought a ja rule cd, and it will definitely be my last. i bought cuz i know it had some songs i liked like ""living it up"", ""im real"" and ""always on time"" from the radio. thing is, pretty much every other song on the cd is ..., all filler songs clearly put in just so there would be enough tracks (smokin and ridin should not fall under the category of a song it is so bad). some of the hits i mentioned above are good, but the cd as a whole is terrible and just shows how greedy an artist can be."
2,looks like pop is somin back in,"ja rule has had 2 good albums. venni vetti vecci is without a doubt the best one ever. it has great beats along with hardcore lyrics. rule 3:36 was decent but had to much singing on it. then pain is love came in. he raps in about 3 out of the 16 songs and one of them (so much pain by tupac) isn't even his. he always sings with his raspy voice and it makes me sick. i wouldnt recomend this album to anyone. the only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of one is bacause i like the songs dial m for murder, smokin & ridin, and so much pain"
2,Not worth your money!,"Man, this album is [not good]..and so is Ja Rule....and he totally bit off Pac's song ""So Much Pain"" using Pac's lyrics and surprisingly Pac is on the song at the end just added in with his verse...other then that, there'z like 2 good songz, and thats it!! I advise not to waste your money on this...peace."
1,Ja is a poser,"Everytime i try to listen to jah i just think dam it's time to throw that cd out window and put on dmx, his voice and lyrics sound more like dmx's than pac's plus dmx wips his ass at hiphop.It's like jah is D's kid and when he gets outa line he has to be taught a lyrical lesson by his supiorer."
1,This album sucks!!!!!,"This is when I started to not like Ja Rule. I hate this CD the single Livin It Up feat Case, is okay and was enough to get me to buy the album because I thought maybe its more like his past albums. But was I wrong.... and what made me really mad was how he distroyed that song with 2pac. That is 2pac's song so please dont give Ja credit for that song. People stay away from this album its nothing like his previous albums. This was officially the last Ja Rule album that I bought!!!!!!"
5,Sloterdijk confronts nihilism--and has a better idea,"""Mistrust is the intelligence of the disadvantaged,"" or ""In any form of erudition, intelligence risks its life"" or ""emigration has become a fact of mass psychology""--these are among hundreds of aphoristic statements that make Sloterdijk's wide-ranging studies and well-reasoned observations on cynicism, Diogenes and the search for truth, Nietzsche, Marx, and the contemporary human situation so striking. He's had enough of nihilism (and all its intellectual and industrial applications), and tells you why. And the book's illustrated with extraordinary aptness--everything from medieval woodcuts to Pasolini. In short, he clears a space to think--a rare event. To read a present-day Lucian who can shake hands with Kierkegaard, read this book."
5,"Fantastic Phenomenology of the Spirit, Like Hegel...","Sloterdijk adheres to the theories advanced by Immanuel Kant in the Critique of Pure Reason, but begins where Kant left off by exposing the force behind dynamic individualism. In other words, the a priori of Kant becomes the a posteriori here--the experience alone mitigates life. Rather than dwelling endlessly on mathematical knowledge, as Kant did, Sloterdijk's epistemology more nearly resembles David Hume's. Indeed, in shaping his discussion of logical versus factual propositions, knowledge by acquaintance is always knowledge based upon what Hume called ""impressions"". The 'cynical' aspect of the title derives from the ""enlightened false consciousness"" Sloterdijk finds in modern society."
2,Mixed Feelings,"Well, I must say that had this book been a bit more organized and better put together it would have been a really good book. But the problem with it was that it threw way too much information on top of you without ever explaining its relevance or meaning. By the time I was done I had not a single clue as to what I had just read. A very unfulfilling book... I would have like to see a little more explanation of the points being presented."
1,Keep looking (this one might not be necessary),"Something about this book does not sit right with me. I can't even put it into words... it's a bit ridiculous and lacks sensitivity. Barbara Marciniak this is most definitely not. I'm sorry but there is more satisfying information out there. If you are pressed for time, I would skip this one."
1,Absolutely Cookoo,"I think this book is one of the kookiest new age books I have read. The basic premise of the book is that humans are and have been manipulated by aliens of various sorts over thousands of years. If the Pleiadians are anything like Satya, who is supposedly the Pleiadian Goddess being channeled by the author, then we may all be better off without them, our supposed saviours and her. This book is full of contradictions, even within the context of the same paragraph. This is an unbelievable book and I only kept reading until the end to completely satisfy myself that it could only get worse - and it did! If you really believe there is no God and Lucifer is a poor, misunderstood creature, then perhaps you might get something out of this."
1,Why is this in 'Astronomy'?,Why is this book in Astronomy? it isn't about astronomy. It's about New Age concepts.
1,Diabolical,"Don't believe anything this book says. How can we trust the intentions of 'spirit guides' ? Why do we assume that they want to help us, instead of mislead us ? Lucifer was able to convince God's angels to rebel against God. How stupid is man in the fallen flesh to think he is immune to this same deception ? This is spiritual warfare going on here, folks. Read the bible and learn what's really going on - then you'll understand the real purpose of this book - which is to lead you to Satan."
1,Difficult,"This book is difficult though sometimes...s o m e t i m e s compelling.The problem that I have with the book is, that Barbara seems to want the reader totake in all of the information as fact. Rarely does the message come across as an offeringfor consideration, but more like shoving the information at the reader.I also found this kind of authoritarianism pushy (as though SHE KNOWSlistening to her in interviews!! It is rough delivery of important topics.And, YOU ACCEPT, point blank). That bothered me a good deal and I could not finish the book.It is true that it is not for beginners either (which I am not) because there is littleencouragement to test the information in your own intuition or good cosmic open sense."
4,The Truth Matters,"Want to know the truth about the way things really are? Want to understand what you don't understand? Want to know the truth about religion? You must read this book. It is NOT an easy book to read, might take you awhile. You also might have to read sections over again to really get it, but in the end, it's worth it! The writer channels the information from the Pleiadian's so it does not flow well, but really opens your eyes to ideas that would have never occurred to you. The book helped made sense out of situations that all my life have plagued me because they didn't make sense. You have to give this book a chance if you have a need to know what is beyond this place we call earth."
3,Not for me,"I was told to check out Barbara Hand Clow's books. I read the Mayan Code with some difficulty, fully admitting that I am not a text book type or history book type of person. But this one, as open as I am-or because I'm as open as I am did not resonate with me. I constantly found myself disagreeing with it, I tried and tried, but could not make it past the extra long first chapter. Maybe others will have more luck. I'd say check it out, you never know."
3,"Really, really great Cd, but...","The problem is not with the Cd. It's really good, actually. But, for God's Sake! 39 dollars??? I've just bought it in another place by 17!!!!"
4,"Very good , but maybe just for fans.","The B-sides from HTTT arent the best songs from Radiohead. For example, the songs in the Airbag EP are much better. Still this is a very good album, but maybe just for fans (plus, for the prize of thise EP you can buy 3 or 4 albums). The weekness i find in Com Lag are the remixes. The original versions are much better than the remixes in this album (including the original version of Fog). But the rest of the songs are very good, the live version of 2+2=5 is great."
3,"Save your money, buy Itch","You'd probally be better of just buying the Go to Sleep sinlge, the two songs off that are really the only ones worth paying for. I paid $10 for the Japanese Import on ebay, and it's worth it because I love Radiohead, but $35+ is nuts. Really, if you can find a copy of Go to Sleep, Gagging Order and I am a Wicked Child are the only songs worth buying. I got my Go to Sleep single for $3 or $4 which leaves a lot of money to but better Radiohead imports."
3,a decent companion for Hail to the Theif,"As Radiohead imports go, this is one of my least favorites. The remixes are really good but the tracks Paperbag Writer, I am Citezen Insane, and Where Bluebirds Fly are just plain dull and not worth more than one listen. Fog (Again) is a pretty albeit brief piano ballad. Two of my favorite tracks are Gagging Order and I am Wicked Child but I already own these as b-sides to one of the american singles from ""Hail"". If you don't own either ""Airbag/How am I Driving?"" or ""My Iron Lung"" I would strongly reccomend buying those first. However if you are like me and can't resist hearing any new Radiohead song you can find then by all means, buy this disc."
3,Way Over Priced,"While I am a dedicated Radiohead fan and have eagerly been awaiting something new, this import is not worth paying $42 for a few 'Live' versions of previously released tunes and a few songs they took off the cutting room floor to throw together a CD to keep the money train rolling. Is this the best they can come up with after all these years? If they had spent endless painstaking hours in the studio to create this CD (as they did in on OK Computer or Kid A) I'd consider it. I only paid $13 for the CD's they actually worked hard to create.Listen to the 'Whiners', we're smart enough to know when we're getting taken for a ride. Never in a million years would I condone downloading songs from a band I don't mind paying good money to support because they're incredible songwriters (i bought all their other CD's), but in this case I'd consider it this one time given the ridiculous price they're asking."
2,Save Your Money,This is not a proper album that Radiohead saved for Japan. It is simply alot of doodling around with keyboards and whatever else the band has in its garage. The live tracks give it the only stars it deserves. Although if you like boring bleeps and blops feel free to drop the 42 bucks on it.
5,Very nice!,I have rosacea and never know how a produce is going to react with it. This mask was so nice! The redness in my complexion had calmed down and my face just looked cleaner!! I can't wait to try the nutrient mask!
1,What a total piece of crap!,"Half way through squeezing the first lime it splits in half. According to a fellow I know who works at a local cooks supply store, they had this happen to about six of them and had to return all they had."
2,Too specific,"To understand most of the book, you need expert skills in telephony, electronic, signal processing, and ITU-T specifications.It is intented mostly to researchers (Jean-Pierre PETIT works at FranceTelecom R&D;)."
2,"Dakota, not Dahcotah",Was very disappointed in this book. Obviously the writer was not of native blood and had no understanding of the actual native american lifestyles and beliefs.
3,Great protection but bulky,This is a great case if throw your Clie in a backpack when going to school. I use it when I am travelling with my NX and it offers excelent protection.But it does add bulk; and for handhelds other than the NX and the NR you will have plenty of leftover space inside.
1,"One Dinky Case, not worth your money",I ordered it for my Clie NR-80V but when I received it I was surprised by it's look. Poor quality product by SONY for it's price. I don't know how this product was released by SONY. If I had seen it in a store I would have not gone near to it at all. Anyway I am returning this dinky PDA case.
1,Not what I expected,This is a poorly written and edited book. Read a different book to glean inspiration from this wonderful woman.

4,Confused?,"Even though I enjoyed this film, I am a little puzzled with it's cert R.On the amazon site under product details it states the film is unrated but when I recieved the dvd it came with an ""R"" rating, so I don't know weather it is cut or uncut....very confused."
1,What A Terrible Movie,"I can sum the plot of this movie up in one sentence: Man goes out and kills senselessly and gets away with it. I've never seen a movie that glorifies killing like this one does. It's disturbing. How long will it take for the next generation of psycho shooters to idolize this movie like the Columbine killers idolized Natural Born Killers? Besides the tasteless plot of this movie, it's aggravating to watch because it looks like the cameraman is either drunk or he's trying to balance himself on a small raft while standing and trying to film. I think that the producers/actors should have thought twice about making and being in this movie..."
1,I'm not judging,"Interesting but quite tasteless! The protagonist Bill Williamson, seems to forget that he too is part of the problem and even partakes in the spoils. Many of us are angry at many things, but like most so-called self righteous beings, they kill the ""innocent"". While Bill's actions are that of someone who is mentally challenged, it somewhat contradicts his actions regarding his planning before and after the event. Then again, many serial killers are not stupid. I think that while the film is shot effectively well and holds your attention, it doesn't do any justice to the so-called cause Bill is claiming and it is quite an irresponsible piece. Still, it's the writers and director's artistic expression and perhaps their views. If you have lost someone in similar incidents then you'll see this film for what it is. Just stop to think for a moment, who are you to judge me and to take my life?"
5,rampage dvd,this movie gave me chills. i hope this doesn't happen in the real world. i know its only a movie but it really made me think how bad things can go if this really happen in life.
3,Good for a laugh,The movie had its highs and lows... I liked all the killing of the innocents... What else can you expect from a low budget film? :_)
3,Seems so inappropriate these days.,"Wow. What a movie. I've never read anything good about Uwe Boll so I had mixed feelings going into this. It pretty much had me glued to the screen though. Ultra-violent is right. Also, the lead character is detestable. His life really isn't all that bad. But, I think that was the point. I'm giving it only 3 stars because while it's well done, in light of recent events I'm not sure I'm comfortable giving a movie 5 stars that glorifies senseless, spree murder."
5,Kevin is cool!,"Kevin Dettmar, besides being my father, is a genius! His book is wonderful, he really has a way with words. He is awesome! Buy his book while you still can!"
2,Kind of a bummer.....,I wanted these for my craft projects. I was disappointed with them. while they are small that wasn't what I didn't like. They are squished into a little bag when you get them. This bends and breaks the quills of the feathers leaving very few usable. The few I got that were not mangled were very pretty. I would not buy these again for sure.
2,not happy,"I got this to use as a bath tub toy box in our ""pirate""themed kids bathroom. It would have been perfect, it's a great size, and the plastic is nice and thick...although mine has a hole on a seam, I tried patching it, but since it's on a seam, it still leaks air.very dissapointed."
3,Wasn't able to inflate,"I bought this as a cooler for my daughter's pirate-themed birthday party. Unfortunately, we were not able to inflate it, which was extremely disappointing. It is now stashed with our Halloween decorations, unused. It might be great if you have some sort of pump that would work with it, but it has been a waste of money to me. It seems like fairly thick vinyl and would probably be nice if I could get it inflated."
4,Man with a vision,"The book left me craving for more to read about the man who accomplished so much in such a short period of time. His duel purpose mission was to balance the power within the sub-continent while liberating it from the foreign power. The author has provided valuable insight into the local political intricacies of the subcontinent, colonial power struggles and the complex personalities of the key players of the liberation movement. It is true that other leaders of the time have greater exposure through media, but Mr. Jinnah is the one who deserves attention as the key architect of the liberation movement. His resolve and determined dedication to his cause melted down the iron will of the British who were eventually forced to realize that they were no longer able to rule the subcontinent. Mr. Jinnah is amongst a few of the 20th century leades who would have lasting impact on the course of the history."
2,Novel of ideas - not Banville's forte,"Kepler is a well written historical novel written during a time when Banville was attempting to write what he considered 'European novels of ideas'. In writing about the mind of a great scientist, has found a way to write about creativity without going down the established, oft cliched route of writing about writing, or painting. However it is fundamentally a poor book, which Banville has subsequently admitted. It artfully chronicles the ideas of Kepler, his struggle, but fails to invoke this in a passionate or beautiful manner.Banville's best novels are works of art. As Beckett said of Joyce, his work is not about anything, it is about the work itself. Kepler is a novel about something, a novel of ideas. It does not work well."
1,"I'm barely awake,","As a licensed therapist, I expected to be interested by this book. I read hopefully for about 50 pages, then I skimmed pretty well for about another 100 pages. What a irritating bore! The counseling accounts were bearable, although a little boring, but the eternal droning on about the squirrels and birds was more than I could bear. The writing was awkward. It made me want to go to my back yard and quit reading -- which i did. Maybe, if you are interested in counseling this might hold more appeal - but I found it simplistic and sentimental in an irritating way."
2,Loved the elliptical; hated the service,"I purchased a Smooth Fitness CE Elliptical on December 22, 2005. The unit was delivered on January 10, 2006. I paid an extra $100 to have the unit uncrated and set up in my exercise room. The delivery person setting up my unit had never seen an elliptical trainer before and wound up setting it up improperly. After about 30 min. of use the next day, the unit started to make a high pitch squeal. I submitted a service request on January 11, 2006. It took two weeks before someone contacted me. On the day that my elliptical was to be serviced, the service agent never showed up causing me to waste a vacation day. When I called Fitness Contractors to inquire as to what had happened, the woman answering the phone was extremely rude and hung up on me. I was so frustrated by the whole service experience that I eventually returned my Smooth Fitness CE elliptical for a full refund. I plan to purchase a Schwinn 438 elliptical trainer in its place."
1,Shop around!,"Beware! The foot pedals are about six inches apart, which can cause strain on hips, kness, and back. I began having a lot of pain in my knees very shortly after daily use of this machine. Most ellipticals tout the closeness of their foot pedals-- there's a reason for that! Do your homework-- I wish I had done mine! Your knees will thank you..."
2,Piece of Junk,"I purchased a Smooth Fitness CE about 2 1/2 years ago and have had it serviced 3 times, due to shotty construction. I'm now convinced the reviews on Amazon are mostly done by the vendors offering products on this site.DON'T buy this elliptical machine if you are over 175 pounds, or plan on using it on a regular basis. I urge you to spend a little more money and get a BETTER machine, which shouldn't be too hard.Oh ya, the 3rd service call will cost me about $300, once the skinny belt that broke, is in and replaced."
1,"Some benefits for mobile professionals, but very high risk","I used a demo version and was satisfied enough to buy it. That's when my problems started: the software corrupted and proved impossible to uninstall, even after having my system administrators edit my registry...When the software worked it was handy and the basic idea is great, but using it nearly destroyed my system. It took me about 50 hours of tech support, personal time, and system admin support just to restore my laptop to full operation and I still haven't been able to get all of this software off of my system."
3,Gas pump,"This pump appears to be the answer to messy gasoline transfers. But in fact, it is very difficult to assemble the on/off valve at the cap and leaks are inevitable. And the constant sqweezing on the handle tires your hands quickly. A D/C powered pump would be much better!"
4,An Eye-Opening Book,"Destiny of Souls awakened in me both an interest with and fascination for reincarnation. The book consists of stories gathered from Newton's years as a therapist and paints a hopeful, balanced picture of the time between lives and the interconnectedness of the soul to all creation.Throughout my reading of this book, my innate skepticism was rarely triggered. It ""felt"" right, even though some of the specifics (like the emphasis on classrooms) seemed a bit hokey.If you are interested in the study of life between lives and reincarnation, ""Journey of Souls"" should be first on your list."
2,Unreal,"I just couldn't get into this book any other way than to think of it as pure fantasy, because that is what it sounds like.With all the ""soul groups"", ""clusters"", ""spirit guides"", ""souls which go in and out of male/female form"", ""any kind of material thing, such as cities, trees, etc., being a figment of the souls' imaginations"", ""spirits walking around and only being able to see their faces and torsos with weird looking eyes""...if all that is stuff that happens when a person dies, then I hope I live forever because that is some dreadful stuff."
4,Journey of Souls,This book was very enlightening. Never thought of the afterlife in this way and now I understand more about spiritual life after our passing into eternity. Interesting!
5,Journey of Souls by Michael Newton,"Great stuff! Amazon works perfect... And so does Michael Newton. He must be in family with the famous Newton, as he has invented Newtons 4. law, which is important for all us Menschen with a soul."
5,Great book!!,"If you are looking to find out about life after death, what happens to us, etc etc...this is the book you need to buy. This book is wonderful. I read it and I'm already reading the second book destiny of souls. This book has made me see life in a different way. It has explained many of the doubts I had about life, and has helped me take life easier and not be so tough on myself and others. It has helped me understand why others are the way they are and is helping me to not judge others as I used to do before. This book has sooo much great information that it will clear any doubts you may have about reincarnation and life after death. I really recommend this wonderful book!!!"
5,It Changes Your Perspective Of Life and Who You Are!!!,"When I first read this book, I was not able to put it down. The case studies were phenomenal and, it intrigued my mind further in finding out who I am and why certain behaviors are triggered in me. These case studies change how you think and feel about life, making you embrace it with more love and devotion towards everything and everyone that surrounds you."
4,A look into life between lives,"A must read. People will discover a point of view about reincarnation, death and Soul. Refreshing."
5,an excellent book,"it help us a lot to feel more comprehensive about our selfs and life, and also more faith. We would like to know if there is someone in México City who could help us to make a journey or how to get in contact with you. Sincereley Alejandro {ballet choreographer} and Alma {ballet dancer}."
4,Very thought provoking,"I am finging this book to be very interesting and believable, expecially in consideration of other information regarding souls that I have recently read. It's an easy read and the author seems very credible to me."
2,didn't appeal to me at all,"Don't get me wrong I read the whole book. However it was a struggle. The metaphor of watching earth on a video before we get here to pick who will be our ""host"" body was disconcerting to me and it certainly did not ring true with my spirit. I do not feel that our spirits are using our human bodies in a partner in a parasitic relationship."
4,Interesting and Meaningful,"One of the few books that gives you a sense of what our soul's purpose is, in the life and in past lives. The only negative I can come up with is that the reader will not really have a sense of what 'heaven' is like. It all seems rather cold and void-like. However, according to the cases hypnotized, it will not really matter. What will matter is who meets and greets us when we cross over, and who we finally end up as our main group of friends/students/guides that journey with us into eternity."
2,disappointing,What I had expected is an academic study on the possibility of reincarnation like ones of Stevenson or Tucker. What I found instead is just a story without any justification.
5,Journey of Souls,"Fascinating book! No matter what religion you subscribe to, this book is a must read. This book goes into much more detail than Dr.Brian Weiss'book ""Many Lives,Many Masters"". It is a very detail oriented look of many case studies of past life regression. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
4,Fascinating and informative research,"This book is a comprehensive account of the author's research into the nature of the afterlife world via hypnotic regression. It includes an enormous amount of information and is quite easy to read. The one problem I found was that the author used conversation with the hypnotized subjects somewhat, rather than only using open-ended questions. However, the characters of each of the souls in the case studies seemed to be consistent enough that this may be irrelevant. Much of the knowledge uncovered is so profound that a reader who believes that hypnosis is a scientifically viable way to study the soul may find this book to be life-changing."
5,Journey of Souls,"This book offers one of the most convincing arguments for reincarnation I have ever read. It left me with wonderful feelings of relief and joy because of the possibility that my soul may go on in time and life is not limited to a one-time journey on earth. Even more important, everything positive I have ever been taught about spiritual matters is underscored while the negative is unsupported. All of the author's conclusions are illustrated by actual quotes from people interviewed under a special kind of hypnosis for this research. I would recommend it to anyone interested in reincarnation, and anyone else who is open to new concepts about life and death."
1,Fiction presented as fact,"I'm probably the only dissenting vote, but I found this book to lack any believabilty. The unidentified subjects used odd language that was not conversational in nature, thus the interviews seemed pre-written and not spontaneous. The whole book smacked of hoax. Why would such a break-through go unnoticed by vitually everyone? I'm sorry I lined the author's pockets. He'll probably write a sequel. Would any of his subjects come forward?"
1,Too much boring interpretation by author,"I started the book but can't finish it, he's way too intense explaining his theories of how everything in the afterlife works, but apparently as fact in his mind as he even draws charts and diagrams. Give me a break - too far out! None of his dialogue has the ring of truth like some authors. I don't see how anybody can read this and agree that it's gonna be like he says. Points of light spinning around in infinity?? what would be the purpose? If you want to be inspired by a happy existence you can look forward to, read The Afterlife of Leslie Stringfellow and anything by Brian Weiss, George Anderson, John Edward. Or the Bible for that matter, mansions and streets of gold. That's what I look forward to :o)"
3,MP3 Narrator takes away from the content...but not a deal breaker,"The narrator was poorly chosen. He's narrating the book like a drama or action-packed thriller. A book of this type should be read very differently even when quoting the Dr's patients. Sometimes the color he adds to the listening of the book brings the focus away from the importance of what is being heard.Not criticizing the narrator who likely has great talent for other types of books---His narration is not a deal breaker but when paying $$ to know and understand information its better received without the ""drama"". Monotone reading would have complimented it better. I won't rate the book as I have not finished it yet...but I already have come to the conclusion 40 minutes into it that I wish they chose another narrator. Narrators CAN make or break a book.ps I had to rate it or else they would not have let me publish my opinion...so I gave it a 3 for now;)"
3,The paths of lost souls,"This book is about LOST SOULS that have taken the WRONG paths in their lives and still have not found the path to heaven.How many more cases will Michael Newton need to hit him on the head before he realizes that these paths taken are paths of ""LOST SOULS"".How many lives will it take you to get to heaven?Michael Newton does not have any true Christian cases and he never will because those souls are not lost they are souls that have taken the path to heaven and they will not be cominginto his office for therapy."
1,A terrible crock of junk.,I do not like this book. I am a Christan and believe in the Bible. There is one God and Jesus is our salvation. There is no such thing as reincarnation. This book is a bunch of junk and lies. I am sorry I purchased it. What a waste of money and time.
5,a true revelation into life,explains many factors of life and incidents bringing peace by answering many unasked questions. Gives a whole new meaning to life and ones purpose for being here. Helps one respect all the constituents of the universe and instills confidence and belief in that one Super-Power whom we choose to call by the name of GOD. May He always guide us through.
5,A realization of Ingrained knowledge! Superb!,"If you have an interest as to why you exist and what your purpose is, this is your book. This book just makes sense to me. I have no religious leaning, but I've always had my spirituality. Everything that I've known deep down, is in this book. I was just waiting for it to remind me and bring it to the surface. A must read!!!"
5,"Life changing, if you're ready for it...","The case studies in this book may not follow strict scientific research guidelines but a message is conveyed with each case. You'll enjoy this book if you have an open mind and believe that the author is simply passing a message to the reader directly from his clients' subconscious and super-conscious memories. The author will from time-to-time give his opinion on certain ideas and notions which are helpful and thought-provoking! Also, the author is extremely clear about the intentions of this book and I never felt like I was being pushed to any particular viewpoint.Most of the material in this book is uncommon I understand that certain people will be turned-off by the studies and probably write the whole book off as ""hokey"". It certainly is a lot to take in especially if you're strongly set in your beliefs.When you're ready, give this book a read with a clear-head and enjoy it for what it is!"
5,Journey of Souls,"I've never read anything about where we go between lives. Now the question is answered and it is astounding!!! This book will give you answers, hope, and will make you really think about how you are doing in your life. Read the next one too."
5,"Very Clear, Great Explanation, and Well Documented","I buy this book for everyone I know who is interested in why we are here and what our purpose is. I also buy this for those who have lost a loved one. I don't say anything, just send it. It answers their questions and comforts them. This book is clear with no opinions - just facts received from subjects."
4,Thought provoking,This book provide an interesting look at lives between lives and gives us hope that there is much more to life than our daily grind.Individual stories share many similarities to one another further giving credit to the truth to this belief. I highly recommend this book to anyone who questions life after death.
1,Waste of $$$$,"I had high hopes for this book after reading many regarding NDE's, channelled info from the Great Beyond, etc. But I cannot believe the Afterlife would be as boring as this book claims....i.e. hanging around in spirit form, with the same soul group you've always incarnated with, attending classes together, waiting for the next round of incarnations. Ye gods, it sounds like hi school that NEVER ENDS!Not my idea of a wonderful Afterlife. And I agree with other one & two star reviews that the ""cases"" aren't very scientific.Regression hypnosis results have NOT been proven totally reliable in many cases, more a product of our imagination--like dreams. I do believe those who have ""crossed over"" CAN contact us thru dreams.....I have personally had ""announcing dreams"" from deceased relatives about events which came to pass.Wish I had passed on this book."
1,Get some real cases!!,"The ""case studies"" in this book sound very fake and made up. They seem limited by Mr. Newton's imagination as appears through the repeated mention of ""tunnel effect"" and ""bright light"". These images are known very commonly as post-death images in all cultures and don't really convey anything new. Mr. Newton, get some REAL cases and then write a book!!I agree that this is a new area (especially in the western world); but some of the older cultures (e.g. Hindu culture) have a lot of literature on the subject and I wish Mr. Newton would have taken time to go through it (as one has to consider the spiritual aspect along with the physical one). I personally prefer the explaination provided by Swami Vivekananda about 100 years back in one of his lectures in London. That focuses more on the philosophical or spiritual aspect; but still seems much more plausible compared to these ""case studies""."
1,Don't waist your time,"After reading all the reviews, I thought that is sounded like a great book.Boy was I disapointed, I am pretty open minded, and the book started off well, But after getting part-way through it, started sounding far fetched. I think he just made stuff up, as to publish a book."
3,Diamond in a concrete casing,"The knowledge contained here is undoubtedly precious, but I find the way it is represented to be almost denyingly dull. I mean the style of dialogs which is like an endless conversation with one and the same underperforming bot; and leangthy scrupolous descriptions of meaningless matters as color coding of spirit development levels and such."
5,"By far, the best in its class!","I have read countless books on this subject over the years and I have never found a book more enlightening and thought provoking than ""Journey of Souls"". Although I believe all the books I have read in this genre have benefitted me and the authors are sincere, ""Journey of Souls"" answered more questions and left an indelible impression on me. I truly recommend this book to all who find themselves searching for answers to questions they are not sure how to ask. I found myself rereading the same pages over and over, ecstatic I had finally found what I had been searching for! This book ties it all together and reveals purpose for all things that occur. I was left with a feeling of resolve and understanding. I cannot emphasize enough how ""Journey of Souls"" reinforces that everything we experience has a purpose and considering the grand scheme, ""fate"" does not deal a bad hand to anyone. We truly make our own decisions. This is a book well worth reading over and over."
4,Journey of Souls,"While the subject matter is very interesting, the writing style is rather dry reporting. The ""journey"" is a laborious slog. I've put the book down several times as it didn't hold my attention. I will finish it but didn't realize it would be a bit of a chore."
5,Do Not Judge,"I really enjoyed Journey of Souls for so many reasons. I don't usually read books on any type of past life regression as I feel it's not wise in most cases to give control of your subconscious and other levels of mind to someone else. But Michael Newton appears to be very evolved by how he handles his regression therapy and how well thought out and organized he is. Many people who meditate see the divine light of our creator and also have some similar experiences as written here of knowing or sensing our guardian angel and angelic teachers. Most do not question reincarnation either, so this would be a 5-star for those in the meditator catagory and also for any seeker. In a non direct way Newton's book expresses why we should never judge others and why we should always live our lives in awareness of the Golden Rule."
4,Human nature,I really enjoyed this book. This book just confirm what my mother told me as a child what she witness and what I witness surrounding her which were being of light. I also believe this book is very comforting to those whom are afraid of death. Great read.
3,Questions still linger.,"Was not what I thought it was. I was more interested in the time between lives. How long between, memory hold over after incarceration. Behavior that isn't normal for a baby or a small child. These questions were not answered or addressed in the book. Still interesting reading."
3,Mystical,"I HAVE JUST LOST A VERY DEAR FRIEND, IT GIVES ME COMFORT IN THE HOPES IT IS TRUE!!!FOR A SEEKER THIS ONE IS VERY INTERESTING"
5,WOW!!!!!!!,"WOW, is all i can really say about this book. I have never read a whole book where every page was interesting. I highly recommend this book to everyone. I think this book was made for a reason, and i am so lucky to be able to be one of the chosen ones to come across this book with beautiful details and important details and information.It makes you understand why you have felt like you have met someone before but never remember where. It makes you understand why you love certain people in your life so very much. Because they were once either your soul mate or child."
5,Insightful...,"Enlightening. Inspirational. Meaningful. Thought provoking.I highly recommend this book, I would also recommend Eckart Tolle's: A New Earth as a complementary reader along with this.I can honestly say these two books have changed the way I view our world, people at large, people's motives, their actions & reactions, my own motives, my actions & reactions, & so on.But, funny thing, you almost have to be ""ready"" to accept change in your life in order to fully appreciate the contents of these books. If they don't catch your attention within the first 2 pages, put it down & come back to them at a later point in your life. You aren't ready yet & you'd be wasting your time."
5,Awesome,I now have a completely different outlook on my life. This is a must read!Everything in my life makes more sense. I believe I have had several lives and now I know why
4,"Journey of souls, definitely takes you on an unforgetful journey!","Book Review: Journey of SoulsBy: Michael Newton, Ph.D.I believe that in some way, everyone has had a ""spiritual experience."" Whether you've felt the presence of a deceased loved one, or have experienced De-ja-vu .Some people choose to believe in it- others choose not too.This book is for people who believe in the Spirit World, who wonder if there is life after death, and want an explanation as to why people are drawn to certain places and time periods.Through hypnosis, Dr. Newton regresses his patients back to their past lives. Each of the case studies are presented in the book, word for word.If you're even a little curious about the Spirit World or any aspect of it, this is a wonderfully enlightening book to read!I give this book **** stars!"
5,Journey of Souls,"This is an AMAZING documentation of subjects, each sharing insight to ""life"" after ""life"", spirit world, and each encouter is similar yet different. I would recommend this book to anyone who is intereted in the ""after-life"", rebirth, reincarnation."
5,A truly EXCELLENT Book!,"I'll admit, I'm still not too sure about multiple lives. But this book is exceptionally well written and appears to be a truly objective research into what the spirit world is like.If you trust the author, then he was dragged into this conclusion by tons of corroborative evidence. I made that leap of faith that he was truthful and given that assumption, the rest of his conclusions are inescapable.I would and have recommended this book to just about everyone I meet."
2,I'm not convinced...,"A good friend recommended this book to me and I ordered it in high anticipation of its arrival.Unfortunately, as I read along, I found myself doubting the conclusions/opinions of the author regarding his clinical experience with a variety of patients and individuals. In other words, the author did not supply any empirical evidence that his conclusions were correct. Too much was left to the unproven veracity of the patients and his subjective opinion.Otherwise, its not a bad read as it does open you up to a pretty comforting belief about death and the aftermath."
2,"Possible, but I have concerns",Some initial elements in Dr. Newton's narrative tie in well with Dr. Raymond Moody's Life after life. Slowly the author moves definitively into uncharted areas. The level of detail seems to be well beyond the material he could have gleaned from his clients. I do want to acknowledge that many of the concepts he espouses do correlate with well known disciplines.
3,Interesting,"To be honest I got about 2/3 done and put it down. The information put forth is rather interesting.Being based on the concept of reincarnation, the problem I found is this.How can it be that these people were born in essentially the same English environment? Sort of like the ""Star Trek Syndrome"" where all the aliens speak English. One would think that it very likely that a good portion of these people would be reincarnated from other nations and vastly different times...But they aren't. If they were, under hypnosis as it were...They should be able to speak fluently in their native tongue right?I don't know all the answers and questions like the above make me scratch my head and wonder as to the validity of these claims. Maybe more explination needs to be given on this mechanic because I just don't get it. Not saying its false, just not evidence at hand to buy into it.But as far as I got it was an entertaining read."
1,Journey of Souls,Not exactly what I expected. Does not seem to agree with a lot of other sources that I have read.
2,Science Fiction.......,"There is almost zero credibility in this book. One of the biggest examples would be the exact nature of how things are in the afterlife, as though he has seen it, and he knows for sure. This book is, however, a great novel if you read it as science fiction."
2,A tad much!,"I am just finishing this book and unfortunately I bought his other book ""Destiny of Souls""! If I knew what this dude claims that he knows I'd be screaming it from a rooftop!! He claims that souls pick their human bodies and also can preselect their occupation and location.I HARDLY chose my human body! I have ""Central pain"" there is no painkillers for central pain!!! I had to move from a freezing climate to a desert climate, WHY would I pick a human body that would develop central pain and require me to move if I knew these things would happen? Also he claimed that you could pick parents with money if you wanted, I picked poor parents and an alcoholic father on purpose? I think not!Save your money, I still believe in reincarnation, he didn't kill that but there are better books on the subject!"
3,The Light,The book Journey of Souls was used but was in bad shape. There was a coffee spill on several pages. Deb R.
1,Journey of Souls,"If you are interested in understanding what it is like ""in between"" one life and the next, this is the book to read. There are several good books on the subject, and this is certainly one of them and a ""must read"".As soon as his next book ""Destiny of Souls"" was published I read it with anticipation. I was pleased with the continuation of Dr. Newton's recount of many of his patient regressions."
4,excelent,loved it. amazed at how much it has enhanced my faith !! I recomend this for all who have an intrest in a broad spiritual life.
5,The First of Three....,"I found this book some time ago, and now have read the first three books written by Dr. Michael Newton. While I have read many books on near death experiences, reincarnation and the afterlife, this was my introduction to ""lives between lives."" It was fascinating to read about the experiences of his clients, when they recalled their thoughts and feelings after they transitioned from past lives on earth, as well as choices made before this lifetime. In fact, I was so intrigued, I bought the next two books immediately! There is so much material here to consider - truly compelling."
5,Now I understand...,"what some of my experiences meant. This book put into new perspective some of my feelings about an entity I knew as my grandfather while he was alive, and as a dear, frequently visting, friend after his death over 20 years ago. I can't begin to explain what this book has meant to my emotional peacefulness... priceless at least. Read it with an open mind and maybe you, too, connect with some long hidden knowledge."
5,Correlates NDE Experience,"After 1983 NDE I have looked for an explanation of my experiences in the Light. When I read the descriptions of the ""homecoming"", the soul groups the sense of belonging, the bliss & peace, I knew I had found my answer. The material will help dispel the fear of physical death, provide comfort, hope and joy. I share the book freely with all willing to read it."
2,Planet of the Apes: The complete TV Series,This was a used copy - the box was not nice but the CD's were fine
4,Classic television,"I remember watching this show on Friday nights on CBS. I loved it then and I love it now. I was so disappointed when it was canceled. Mark, Leonard and Roddy Mcdowell are fantastic in their roles as Urko and Galen. Some episodes are better than others, but every episode has an interesting story line. My only complaint is there is no real connection between the episodes. After the opening episode, you could really watch this in any order. Other than that I wish they would recreate this series, maybe pickup with finding our original astronauts as old men, standing over Galen's grave..."
4,Go Ape!,"A not so bad but extremely short-lived show. McDowell back as a friendly chimp starring with Ron Harper (previously know for GARRISON'S GUERILLAS) and James Naughton -- brother of AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON's David Naughton. One episode features a very young Marc Singer and William Smith as his dad. Sorry, but in real life Naughton's astronaut character could not have beaten Big Bill."
4,"Fun, but too short-lived","I bought this DVD collection, along with The Planet of the Apes movie collection, for my husband on his b-day. We had so much fun watching it, the only sad thing is that it's 14 episodes and way to short-lived. The audio and pictures a nicely restored, we can finally toss those TV-taped episodes."
5,Awsome,If you like Planet of the Apes this is AWSOME. Also the quality of the DVD'S are great for a TV show this old.
4,Fun But Thought Provoking,"I hadn't realised how dated this show was until I started watching it this week. It is still good though. Roddy McDowell is great as always as Galen, the chimp who is more human that most humans. It is an adventure series, but the psychological aspects sometimes overpower the story. Some of the episodes are, of course, better than others, but as a whole, the series merits watching."
5,"""Only"" 32 Years Later, But Well Worth The Wait!","I was 9 years old, in 1974, when this series premiered. I'd never seen anything like it before and was instantly hooked. My favorite character was Galen (played by the always wonderful Roddy McDowall) but I also admit to having a childish crush on astronaut Pete Burke (James Naughton). I even wrote my very first fanfic story, based on this series! Ahhh, memories... To say I was thrilled to discover this was available on DVD is an understatement -- I've worn out THREE sets of VHS tapes already due to repeat viewings! If you're a fan of the Apes movies, this set is a must-have!"
3,Actor Ron Harper's own view of his tv show,"He said people said it was boring and he agreed. He much preferred the Land of THe Lost tv series he later starred in over POTA. I think the tv show's problem is actually and mostly the film it was shot in. This type of film was more fitting for a raw, earthy hippie film like Easy Rider. Not a show that was supposed to be an involved scifi series like POTA. And though there is music from time to time it's too quiet overall. The theatrical POTA films often had much more effective use of exciting music."
2,problems with dimming scenes,"i've got it and it has scenes where the lighting changes mid-scene, going from light to dim and back again...makes it almost unwatchable...dave ;]"
5,Yep just as I remembered OK,Most things I Review I say yep or nope. So I’m short about 19 0r so words for your review.
5,This box set is simply FANTASTIC !,"Where do I begin? I absolutely LOVED this show as a kid, and I could hardly wait to get my hands on this box set once I knew it was going to be available. I managed to catch these episodes some years ago when they were aired on the Sci-Fi Channel, and I wondered if these classic episodes would ever become available as some sort of video collection. Except for the original Star Trek series, I don't believe I have ever thoroughly enjoyed another sci-fi tv series, nor felt such a feeling of closeness between the main characters (Virdon, Burke, and Galen). These episodes are just as wonderful and fun to watch as I remember them. I am pleased to own this FABULOUS collection ! A must have for all POTA fans, and worth every penny! :}"
4,Better even than I expected,"This set wasn't high on my priority list, but I finally picked it up on sale from Amazon and was pleasantly surprised. The shows definitely show their age, but the stories were better than I'd expected. Ron Harper and James Naughton worked well together, although I think their comedic banter at the start of many episodes went a bit too far. Roddy McDowell was great as always as Galen. Lots a great guest stars from other 60s and 70s shows appeared, including Mark Lenard, Royal Dano, William Smith, Marc Singer, John Hoyt, Jacqueline Scott, Geoff Deuel, John Lormer, John McLiam, Michael Strong, Morgan Woodward, Beverly Garland, Harry Townes, Joseph Ruskin, and Sondra Locke.When I had finished watching all 14 episodes, I was truly sorry to have no more to look forward to. It's a shame the series didn't get the chance to play longer and give us a conclusion.If you're a Sci-Fi fan or fan of 70s-era television, then I'd highly recommend this enjoyable, but short-lived show."
1,Disappointing,"This is really boring and poor. There's almost no street racing footage. It's mostly an advertisement for an auto show, and footage of a long boring amateur rally race."
1,It's a lot smaller that the picture makes it appear,"I guess you get what you pay for, but the cross was extremely small and light-weight. I bought both the pink and purple crosses for my twins. They were so small, I couldn't tell which color was which."
2,Biased and unscholarly,"This book seemed to be written with a specific agenda that came from a very modern (and biased) perspective toward the Middle East, a perspective that the author projected onto the past. Not the way history should be written."
3,"Not bad when they report on history, but...","Not bad when they report on history, but their disdain for President Bush (and idolization of President Clinton) causes their treatment of the current Middle East turmoil to suffer from partisanship.If you are, like me, taking your first real step into the history of the Middle East, expect to read this book several times. Covering 1500 years of history in 500 pages is a bit too ambitious. The result is a ""rushed"" experience; just not enough space is devoted to the material.In addition to their partisanship (particularly Professor Goldschmidt's) I was disappointed in the lack of a thorough explanation of the differences between Shia and Sunni Muslims.In spite of my reservations, I do recommend this book and I will be reading it again once it is returned from a friend."
1,Poor history lesson,"I had to use this book in an undergraduate course. It is extremely biased and the author on many instances goes way over the line into editorializing. It is a poor example of true history but an excellent example of revisionist history. In chapter 9 the author states "" But in history we care as much about what people believe to have happened as we do about the literal truth"". Any time a historian puts as much emphasis on tales as much as fact they are on thin academic ice."
4,This is worth it!,"I really like this video because of its variety. I especially like the ten minute workout for the abs. The only thing I recommend is buying the DVD if that is an option so that you can go to the section you want, when you want. The instructor does a great job cueing and is surprisingly coordinated enough to instruct kickboxing, pilates, ballet, yoga, and weight training. This is a great video to buy to supplement other workouts or if you need to squeeze in a quick workout on a busy day."
3,Good Overall,"I found this a little fast for me as a beginner, but once I got the hang of it, its a pretty good overall workout."
2,workout dvd,Not the best. Dvd quality is not great. I own allot of the 10 min solutions. Not impressed with this one.
5,Great for Busy People,"I hate to exercise but not with this DVD! I am very busy and don't have much free time, so this works perfectly. I like the flexibility of being able to choose which exercise I want to do... Yoga, Kickboxing, Pilates, Ballet or Bootcamp. You can choose which exercise suites your mood and do one workout for 10 minutes (anyone can spare 10 minutes a day) or you can do as many as you please. If you don't like to exercise and are looking for a starting point, this is it. I recommend it to everyone I know. I have never liked to exercise but now I Love It!"
3,Good... but not great,"I've been doing the Quickfix total workout on DVD for the last few weeks and I wanted to try the 10 Minute Solution as variety. I like the idea of 10 minute workouts, and I can squeeze them into my busy schedule. I also like that the DVD has variety. HOWEVER, as an earlier reviewer mentioned, the camera is incredibly jumpy, almost to the point of making me dizzy. Plus the camera often misses the important parts of the instruction. The instructor doesn't explain hardly anything -- just jumps into it -- and I mean JUMPS. The feeling is frenetic and it's very hard to concentrate on good form. If you want a really good 10 minute workout where you'll get good explanations about form, and the proper way to do the exercise, I'd recommened the Quickfix series instead."
5,A must have for the DVD exerciser,"I love this workout. I had it in VHS and would either do all 5 10 minute segements back to back for a great 50 min. workout or I mix and match and add segments of it to other workouts. The nice part with the 10 min. segments is that if you just want to do something to get your mind off something, jump into this for 10 mins. and your focus will change 100%!"
5,great 10 minute solution dvd,I'm 45 and I've been using this dvd (pilates segment) for many years now. The 10 minute pilates really works your core (don't worry it gets easier after a few times)and I use it to prep for riding (horses) - but strengthening your core helps in a number of activities. I use this and Sean Corn's Vinyasa flow yoga dvd (session one)on days that I don't run and they are a perfect way to start the day before work.
2,Not as worthwhile as the other 10 minute solutions,"I love to use the 10-Minute Solutions workouts to obtain a variety in my exercise. I wouldn't recommend this one. The workouts are not well planned out and at times the instructor rushes through an exercise. Compared to the other 10-Minute Solutions workouts, this one is below par."
5,Love it! Especially good for moms!,"This tape has a lot of variety in its workouts, which kept me from getting bored with it. It is divided into five 10-minute segments, and each segment is designed to be a workout by itself. This was great for me because I have two small kids and sometimes 10 minutes is all the time I have before one of them needs me for something. On the other hand, when I get more time than that I just keep working through the segments one after the other. This way you can get up to a 50-minute workout. This is just the right type of video for getting back into shape (which I needed after my second child was born) or for getting started on a regular exercise routine if you haven't been on one previously. The Pilates segment is especially good for toning up an out-of-shape tummy; the Boot Camp and Kickboxing segments give a short but effective aerobic workout; and the Ballet and Yoga segments are nice for stretching and strengthening the muscles."
3,This is a fast-paced video...,"I bought this video for the varied workout styles and the time saving element. It definately does have great variety and you do feel that you are getting a good workout in the short bursts of time. I tend to combine two or three of the sections, starting out slow and building. But this video is not for beginners. This is a fast-paced video. The instructor goes over the move and then bam, she's into it. I've been working out for a while and I find it hard to keep up. I guess when you only have ten minutes you need to keep it moving along, but I feel that this video is for people who are already working out and are a quick study."
