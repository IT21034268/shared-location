3,Pure Classic,An amazing and short read. this book is so thrilling and it was amazing for a history junkie like because it is based of the pivitol scottish time period. i would suggjest this book in a heart beat.
4,An old-school story...,"...with many relevant themes: treachery, perseverance and above all, loyalty. A difficult read for a high-school freshman, owing to setting, period and Victorian verbosity. But the didactic in this classic makes it well worth slogging through. I would have given it 5 stars, but unfortunately the binding fell apart like every other Signet book I've read since 1986!"
1,Kidnapped,"Very disappointed as the book that i received was not New as it was advertised, and over priced for the quality it supposedly was described!So i sent it back. Very disappointing."
4,Treat for the mind,"I loved the twists and turns, but especially good over bad. Justice done. I only wish the story had not endedthere.?"
4,A fun classic.,"It was an easier read than I thought it would be, and filled with all the fixin's of a good story--terror, betrayal, friendship, humour and much more."
2,This book was not interesting enough.,"This book was about a kid named Davie, that is going to see his father's old house ""The House of Shaws"" in a city that and he has to take a boat to get there. When he got to the house his uncle was there witch he has never met. His uncle fed him and then put him in a room and locked him in there."
2,For advanced readers only,"This book was written sometime ago. The dialogue and words are of very old English, and it is easy to find yourself lost. This book has an good story, but it is only easly understood by someone alive in the 1700's. So before you buy this book, ask yourself if your up the the challenge."
2,A simple conversion of the Project Gutenberg text,"This review is for SmartBookWorms' Kindle edition of Kidnapped: B003RWS6FOParagraph formatting mostly good, although the dedication is all centred. Straight quotes, CAPS instead of smallcaps. Proper dashes. No extra notes. Original footnotes in-line in the text. No Table of Contents link the in menu. Hyperlinked table of contents in the text. No maps. Opens to Cover. Preface and dedication.No real advantage over the free version. There are better editions available.

Search for ""Kidnapped Stevenson"" (without the quotes) to find the 25 or so editions available. And also look for my review ""Kindle Edition Choice is critical"" for a review of all the available editions as of August 2010."
4,EXCELLENT!,I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK. IT IS VERY WELLWRITTEN. I THINK IT IS ONE BOOK EVERYONE WHOLIKES ADVENTURES SHOULD READ
3,Sometimes you can't go home again....,"I purchased this book for the phenominal NC Wyeth artwork and decided to reread this classic adventure that has been so popular with young readers for so long. It was incredibly tedious and I wondered if it were perhaps because I have become jaded by modernized storytelling. I suppose if it were to be read aloud to a youngster, more of the enthusiastic action could be drummed up. Sadly, I was disappointed that it didn't stand up to my own test of time the way that other stories, such as TREASURE ISLAND, have..."
3,It was alright,"Kidnapped is not the book that I thought it was going to be. It had a decent story line, but some of the language was hard to understand. I would not reccomend this book to the youn reader, even though it is considered a kids book. It can be hard to follow at times, and it is hard to keep ones attention on the book. Overall I was not pleased with this book."
3,"it was alright, but.....................","I have read this book and watched the Disney movie, and have to say, that the movie is way more thrilling than the book would ever be. The dialogue is very confusing and not clear. (at least in my version) But to be fair, the movie was very interesting and the actor wasn't too bad...lol I say, see the movie and or read the book and judge for yourselves. :o)"
2,Good story; less-than-competent narration,"Kidnapped is a classic adventure tale, and stands on its own. My rating and comments are about the production. The sound is good, although the announcement of each new chapter clips off the heels of the former. The real disappointment is the reader, Frederick Davidson. First choice of the publisher should have been to find someone with a real Scots accent; second choice, to find someone who could be coached to create a credible Scots accent. The best reading was in the [very short] speeches of Davie. The speeches of the other men were mostly done in growls. In the long narrated parts, Davidson starts out trying (unsuccessfully) to sound Scottish, but by the end has apparently gotten tired and given up completely. He sounds, actually, like a Dick Francis hero--completely the wrong kind of voice for this tale.I liked the story very much, but the quality of the reading detracted from the story."
3,Hard reading,The story is quite good but the language was very difficult for.me to follow. I rather the small story. =)
4,Great book,I read this book at the same time my son did. I read mine on my kindle app on the iPad and he did on his kindle. We both loved the book and since it was free...who can really beat that. Thanks for having it available.
4,Dark Melody,"There is no doubt about Seal's talent throught the early 90's. After the success from his first record, Seal, he needed to find a way to duplicate the feel from his first record. With the opening single from his second self-title record, Seal on the line, it was a way to get his soul burning again. Prayer For The Dying is a very dark, soulful song that captures the feel of the artist. Still, it almost sounds as dark as Crazy did from his first record. Still, it was a minor hit, until Kiss From A Rose came along. However, this song is truly for any die hard Seal fan."
2,Pretty disappointing,I bought these as gifts and the feedback I got was that they were flavorless and old-tasting. I should have heeded the other reviewer's warning.
1,Chewy like gum!,"Unfortunately I had to return these nuts because they were moist & chewy....YUK! However, I have had this brand in the past and enjoyed them tasty & crunchy."
2,My least fav release by NS.,"After everything that National Skyline has released, this is by far my least favorite. The only songs I like are ""Ghosts"" and ""Karolina II"". ""October"" and ""Identity Crisis"" just don't do anything for me. They don't have that typical National Skyline atmospheric brilliance. Even ""Ghosts"" and ""Karolina II"" aren't THAT good, but better than the other two. If you're just getting into NS, check out Bliss & Death, Primitive Parade, or either volumes of the Broadcasting EPs. If you're huge into National Skyline, then get this EP, but if not, go ahead and skip it."
3,The black dye leaks onto the skin. :(,"LL Bean shearling slippers are better and Acorn Toasters are the best.These have been a regrettable purchase although I won't be replacing them and wear them daily. After less than a month, the inner lining has started to bump up.Is this frugal? no but my frugal $9 pairs had worn out after many washingsWould I have purchased this used at a cheaper price off of craigslist? noDid I shop around for the best total price including the manufacturer's website? yes and so should you"
1,Not happy,"The picture and title is very deceived. The title should something for ""kid"" or ""children"".I'm not happy with this purchase at all."
4,Child Labor,"When I'm drinking beers in the yard there is nothing like watching my son haul stuff with his John Deere wheelbarrow. And best of all, it's John Deere so you know it screams red neck!"
2,looks are deceiving,"The product seems sturdy, although the picture is very deceiving. The size of this wheelbarrow is much smaller than it seems...not much room to put things in...my son will outgrow very quickly. This should be sized for two year olds at the most. Also, very expensive for what it is. Found much larger one at Lowes after purchasing this one and it was half the price. You pay for the name...Overall, not a lot of bang for the buck!"
3,Smells like smoke,"Overall, this is a super cute toy. I bought it for my one year old for Christmas, and my 6 year old son went crazy over it, even though it is too small for his size. It is super cute and looks like it will hold up well. Unfortunately, the entire thing reeks of smoke. No other packages that I received from Amazon that were delivered on the same day smells like this, so I can only conclude that this came from the manufacturer."
4,Son LOVES this wheelbarrow,"My son who just turned 4, loves this wheelbarrow. He likes being able to help out in the yard and this wheelbarrow is perfect for him."
5,Great wheelbarrow for real use!,"Santa brought this last year for my three year old son, who loves all things truck and building. It has real rubber wheels and is made for real work outside. It's durable and well worth the money. I highly recommend it, and so does my son!"
5,John Deere Kids Wheelbarrow,"Extremely tough, durable item,My Grandson loves it and uses it in the garden helping his Dad.When not in the garden, he uses it for moving his toys from place to place in the house."
1,no no no,"if u dont want to quit making music, dont get this book.... its too geeky .... i warned u.... dont come to me later after getting this book and asking what did u do wrong"
2,Technical,"Not exactly what I was searching for.Definitions, technics theory, not enough practical exercisesBasic terminology, I need more practic"
5,yesterday today tomorrow,I got into computer music with Sonar and using only software synthesizers I opened up a whole new universe of sound. This book will help you on your way. A little history not much math but a lot of help. If you intend to follow this path give this book a read!
2,"Hmm, not bad for America :P","Konnichi wa! If you look at reviews of a few other SM videos you may recognize Usagi-Bunny. I don't watch many dubs, but before I discovered the subbed Sailormoon S I was a dubbie. :p Baka me! Anyway, on to the movie. It was *okay*. I didn't give it one star because I liked the ep where they defeated Jedite. (Jadeite is the CORRECT spelling)! I wish they had this movie subtitled and in my beloved Japanese. :) I am not Japanese (most of us on here aren't) but I am learning it and I've fallen in love with this language. Sailor Mars is *okay* but I like her better in the Japanese."
1,horribly outdated,"It's really sad that some people might judge gothic genre by this compilation. Most of the songs are horrid punk-with-eyliner-on moshpit nonsense. (e.g. TERRIBLE Cure cover) If you are into stuff like Misfits or Cramps you are gonna find more then one ""gem"" to play with on this double, but if you are looking for an intro to actual gothic music pass it on and pick up something more fresh & tasteful. (Prefferably not one of Cleopatra compilations)"
3,Good but not great,"This is the third Jackie Mason DVD I bought. The material was good but not as good as some of his previous stuff. A lot of his old shtik is in this performance. I am not a prude but he dropped the ""F"" bomb a lot. I think people should know this in case they have children around. He never swore in the other DVDs I have. Still...I am not sorry I bought this."
3,Love jackie except for the XZ0# language,"Jackie is the best in my time. I wish he would leave out the bad language, so I can recomend it to others. Maybe his people could BLEEP them?"
3,"Old Model, New Packaging",This Model by Revell is a rather simple model that has not improved in quality since the early 1970's. Revell has used the same old outdated inaccurate molds and just dressed up the packaging. A very basic model indeed!
4,"Humorous, Fun Version of The Beggar's Opera","I didn't realize when I started reading this that the play would be funny, but I found myself laughing frequently. Satire the drama is supposed to be, and satire Brecht does well. Admittedly, I didn't catch that he was satirizing specifically bourgeois society until almost the end (and I found Brecht's notes much more confusing than helpful), but that didn't subtract from my enjoyability of the book. I had expected it to be a much harder read, quick only for its short length, but found it overall very accessible and entertaining. It also helped remind me of the basic plot of John Gay's The Beggar's Opera, which I read a few years ago and also enjoyed. I only wish I knew what the music was like. Does anyone know of a good performance of The Threepenny Opera that can be found online?"
3,holes in it...,"holes in the toys...had to pull out the needle to fix it...oh well...it is cute, only things is that it was left to long in a box at storage i think and moths got to it...i should have check it when i first got it but i didn't so i couldn't return it since it was more then 30 daysa and i already give it to my kid.."
2,Product seems not authentic,I have been wearing this perfume for many years. I have the suspicion that this one is not like the ones I was buying from the perfume shop. I'm not sure about it but something in the smell of it seems different.
2,"Usually rock solid Asher, a (mostly) failed time travel attempt","I loved both The Skinner and Girdlinked (with The Skinner being the superior book), but am disappointed with Cowl. Time travel and the various paradoxes caused by time travel always makes for tricky sci-fi that never really works. Asher makes a valiant attempt, but I did not find myself engaged by the story or the characters in this setting. Read The Skinner."
2,Not Neal's typical fantastic work,"First novel I read after I ran through all of the ""Polity"" series. I was disappointed. Was very 50's ish sci-fi. Heavy on corn, difficult to follow the storyline, the ""science"" lacks authors typical believability as was present in the ""Polity"" novels. Disappointing ending."
4,My 100-word book review,"From the writer of the Polity series, Cowl is a stand-alone novel, which nonetheless has all the elements that make Asher's other books immense fun to read. Human factions from the future are fighting each other on a shifting battleground that encompasses all of recorded history, and most of prehistory too. The two vulnerable protagonists, from our near future, are caught up in the action and find themselves drawn back to the dawn of life on Earth - where the formidable Torbeast lurks. This is a fast-moving rollercoaster of a science fiction thriller, chock full of twists and clever touches."
4,Cool.,I picked up this book looking for a quick read.That is not what I got.The way this book delves into time travel requires you to read and re-read paragraphs and sometimes pages. If you like time travel or just good 'ol science fiction pick this up and give it a read.
1,"Patti is Great, Shame on Flare, the record label though!","I am a fan of Patti Page and has been collecting her CD through the years. The latest compilation is great news for her fans because there are more than a dozen of these digital tracks that could not be found elsewhere. Unfortunately, the record company chose to manufacture this CD on cheap, self-destructive CD-R, rather than the common silver-surface CD. (I bought several copies of the same record, but all of them turned out to be printed on CD-R). So buyers beware!!If you want to read more about my personal experience with CD-R, please read my other review: http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21SY1XMVRH3YQ/ref=cm_cr_pr_auth_rev?ie=UTF8&sort;_by=MostRecentReview"
2,"If you write a historical novel, then get your history right.","Anachronisms, one after the other. Just in the first fifteen pages: Isabella chooses not to travel by railroad to New Orleans, which is a good thing, since there weren't any in the 1820s. Rutherford refers to ""Piltdown Man"", who wasn't dug up until 1912. ""Credit to the race"" is a twentieth century phrase. And ""locofoco"" matches were invented four years after ""Entry, the first"" was supposedly written.I can't imagine what else Johnson comes up with in the remaining 200 pages, but this kind of carelessness doesn't warrant serious reading, much less a national book award!!"
4,Descriptive on ever page,I'm not done yet but it is amazing how the slaves on the ship have yet to give up. Perhaps this is due to the incredible leadership of Rutherford. I have enjoyed how you show that there were black leaders.
4,Interesting Concept,"To imagine a fella that finally is freed from slavery and has a nice life to look forward to, decides to give it all up because of debt and a woman that isn't so pretty. He jumps aboard a boat that is set to sail, and then is stuck on it for months. He is then subjected to so much horror and unimaginable dealings that he finally appreciates the good life, the family life and structure in the end. He learns some very valuable lessons. I guess you really have to go through bad times to appreciate the good in your life."
4,"A luminous, entertaining read...","I just finished reading Charles Johnson's book for my reading group, and I enjoyed it much more than I had anticipated. It's a rousing sea-yarn with layers of captivating images (the captain, the cargo, the last scene), and comes beautfully full-circle at its end. The narrator's point of view and use of language is consistently interesting, and the other characters Dickensian in their quirks and motivations. Highly recommended, if not perfect."
2,"Can you say "" WORDY"" ?","Honestly, I don't understand how this book has received such glowing praises! It was so bad, I couldn't even finish it! I am OK with painting a picture, but 1 sentence commonly went on for 4 or 5 lines. Often, 1 sentence was an entire paragraph. Not sure where the fans went to school, but where I come from, that is bad writing! Usually, by the time I got to the end of a sentence (paragraph), I couldn't remember how the beginning started! Punctuation please!"
2,Middle Passage,"Engaging, gross, probably an authentic depiction of life in New Orleans and at sea in the 1800s. Over-the-top in gore and inhumane treatment, philosophical truisms. Must be read with a dictionary, unless you are super literary, know English from the 1800s, know nautical terms, and the anatomy of old ships."
4,Vivid Descriptions!,"Charles Johnson's Middle Passage is a masterpiece by all definitions. This story of a former slave who accidentally ends up on a slave ship is well woven and is full of gripping descriptions of the horrid conditions of life on a slave ship. All of Johnson's characters, despite their stereotypical air, come across as three dimensional humans, as opposed to hard-nosed sailors. However, one of this novels biggest draws, is also one of it's biggest shortcomings. Johnson's eloquence and amazing grasp of the English language entices readers with sights, sounds and smells, but they seem a bit much for the character of Rutherford Calhoun, a former slave and professional thief. Perhaps he would have been more believeable in third-person, speaking in New Orleans vernacular as opposed to the King's English. Similarly, Johnson's Calvinoesque use of allusions is a little confusing, but gets the point across. Definitely a must read!"
1,A monument to political correctness!,"I come to this book late--ten years after it was written. Looking at the other reviews, the better of which make my points (i.e,, infuriating anachronisms, unlikely plot and indifferent grammar), I see that this must have been one of the first salvos to political correctness. A National Book Award? It's the subject that wins and damn the actual execution of the book. Ten years later we have excellent books to go to such as Bell's ""Slaves in the Family"" and the wonderful collection of slave narratives from the Library of Congress archieves, called ""Remembering Slavery."" Skip the Johnson, it's bad history and worse writing."
3,it was sort of hard to read,the book was interesting in the beginning.toward the ends it was not so hot.
3,Being a Jazz genius is worth a beer in Paris,Growing old when you have abused your body and blown away your soul can be hard.Kind of a slow movie with not always good music:the how good tenor sax here is exagreratedand sometimes he hits some real sour notes.The old tenor sax man and jazz composer finds a French friend who saves him for a last bright stand in Paris.
3,Not Very Realistic But Quite Enjoyable,"Yes, it's annoying that the plot hadda have some idealistic and passionate white French guy offer salvation to the tortured and irresponsible Negro jazz musician, but the movie is an enjoyable character study. Dexter Gordon gives an undeniably riveting portrayal of the quintissential jazz cat and the climactic outdoor memorial concert is great."
1,Jazz in slow motion,"I'm a huge jazz fan, but this film was so absolutely boring that I turned it off about halfway through. I couldn't bear to hear Dexter Gordon slowly mumble one more line. Very dissapointed in this purchase."
1,annoying voice of Dexter Gordon.,"Dexter Gordon's voice is terrible to hear all allong this movie. The French actor plays a stupid fanatic who forgets he has a life. This whole story might be true but the voice is terrible and the rythm of the movie is sloooow. I bought this movie because of your review but after I had seen it I returned it to the store to exchanged it. Compare this movie to Bird or Mo better blues and you will give those two movies a 10. With all due respect to Dexter Gordon's musical genius, Tavernier should have chosen an actor with a better voice. Typical french movies, they throw things at you that you must like beacause it is supposed to be deep and intellectual. Wrong. as Serge Dassault inventor of the Mirage jet fighter once said: "" a plane can be technically the best, but without beauty it isn't a plane."
5,A magicial marriage of music and dialog,"A wonderful blend of mood and music. The shadows cast in this black and white film are as strong as the people and places that make them. An all star cast of some of the worlds greatest (jazz) musicians makeing music live to tape. This makes it one of the stongest conversational films of all time. There are the words that are spoken by the actors/musicians, and also the music that is spoken by the musicians as musicians. The music becomes dialog. All the live music scenes are recorded live to tape. This is very, very rare in cinema and only done on talk shows on TV. And in Round Midnight this magicial marriage merges successfully."
4,Great Jazz movie,"A great movie about Jazz in Parisand how a French man (Francois Cluzet)becomes the agent of the greatest Tenor saxplayer(Dale Turner) played by Dexter Gordon.It's a great tribute to the life of so many American musiciansin Paris in the late 50'sfeaturing:Dexter Gordon ,Herbie Hancock(academy award winner for the soundtrack)John Mc Laughin,Bobby Hutcherson and many others"
5,No middle ground,"I find it curious that in all the reviews of ""Round Midnight"" that there is virtually no middle ground. People either loved the movie (most) while others hated it. I suspect those that didn't like the movie are devotees of fusion and fail to appreciate the jazz of the 1950's. Gordon while not the ""topical"" character of the film, lived this story as an expatriated saxphonist. He brings a reality to the picture that is lacking in similar ventures such as ""Bird"". While I think ""Bird"" is too an outstanding film, the reality of watching the music being created live is not there.This film shames efforts like ""Lady Sings the Blues"" because of its stark reality. There is no glossing over and memorializing Dale Turner in the movie. He's there with all his warts for all the world to see. This wasn't a star vehicle like ""Lady..."" was for Ross. This may be the most honest film ever made."
4,True Surrealism,"I was afraid to read this book at first fearing it would be a horribly dreary account of life in insane asylums but it is something more. This is a great little book in the same vein as Gerard de Nerval's, Aurelia and Zurn has just as wonderful a voice. Her matter of fact and almost innocent narrative of her insanity is by turns disturbing, depressing, hilarious and ultimately poetic. Her style is somehow innocent and sophisticated simultaneously similar to the Alsatian Poet, Hans Arp's. It is definitely one of the great works of surrealism and one of the few objective accounts of insanity from the inside."
2,Mary MacLane,"Pretty boring, no plot. It's a collections of a very self centered girl and I kept waiting for the point, but gave up halfway into it."
2,A waste of time,"Perhaps I was too hasty, but I did give it a decent try, hoping the book would redeem itself. The author seemed to agonize at length about her uninteresting life that was going nowhere. Seemed like eventually there wuld have been a story there, but I got tired of reading how boring her life was that I finally gave up and deleted the book from my Kindle."
1,The Story of Mary MacLane,I only read the first few pages and couldn't get interested. I did not like the way it was written.
2,Hilarious Hammer Hokum,"This is really an embarassing film from Hammer Studios. Don't expect a prehistoric film like ""One Million Years BC""...this one is strictly a jungle adventure (for the first 20 minutes it resembles a Tarzan film from the 50's!). It's all about a tribe of skimpily clad babes who worship a white rhino (with a big phallus shaped horn). A male hunter comes to their camp and all the babes fight over the stud. Sexy Martine Beswick hams it up as the Queen and there are many laughs (and MANY tribal dances), but it all wears out way before the 91 minutes are over. Still, it's nice to finally see it and the widescreen image on the DVD looks very good. The flip-side of the disc has some trailers and one of those Hammer specials."
1,Very poor,"This is without doubt one of the worst Hammer films that you can currently buy. It is mercifully short (under 90mins) but even this is too long. There are numerous scenes of dancing and singing which drag on and in truth the film need only have been about an hour in length.My understanding is that this was made after ""One Million Years BC"" using the same set and costumes, which obviously enabled Hammer to get another film out very cheap (probably as a B movie). However the acting is on occasions wooden and the story/script must have been written in an afternoon.Its only redeeming feature (for a man) is lots of women in prehistoric bikinis! This is also available as part of the 21 disc Hammer boxed set collection (only region 2 I think). If you must own this film it would make sense to buy that and get some good films into the deal as well."
2,"Granted this is not the best movie ever, BUT...","It's a given that this movie does not have the best storyline in the world. I didn't take to the rhino worshiping either, but I dont care! Edina Ronay is so incredibly beautiful! She could be 80 and still be a knockout! I love her!"
1,A genuine stinker. Don't confuse with the camp 1966 film.,This film has nothing to recommend it. It's incorrectly linked-to in Amazon's data base from the 1966 film with the same title. THAT film is a camp classic--at least for those who can appreciate blond bimbos in doeskin bikinis worshipping a white plaster rhino.
5,i am a black man...,"and this is a great book...read this and you will see why the black man feels the way he does; why interracial relationships remain the enigma that no one wants to unravel and the the battles that black people fight in general...also read "" one for new york,"" by williams"
1,Disappointing,"Sound quality on this CD is poor (very ""tinny"" & lacking in deep bass richness one would expect of good dance mixes). The mixes themselves might be great but they sound like they are being broadcast over an old AM radio."
2,Garage mixer,"I really like GLJ and I have all of the disks; however, this one is pretty bad. Most of the mixes are very poor quality. Go ahead and remix them yourself on your computer for a better sound."
4,Very Soft,"I love this puppet, it is very soft and great for me to entertain my baby with. It fits average sized hands and is made with quality."
1,I wouldn't recommend this product to friends or ...,"I wouldn't recommend this product to friends or family. The taste, consistency, and texture were offensive to me."
3,My children seemed to really like them. They ...,"My children seemed to really like them. They have a slightly different taste than what I expected. They're almost like a Fig Newton chewy. They were very filling and helped us feel that we were no longer hungry. They helped us feel more energetic. My family tried the product and the children seemed to be the most impressed, although the adults also thought that they felt more """"alive""""."
4,I'd never had a Balance Bar before and ...,"I'd never had a Balance Bar before and wasn't sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised at the taste. It was chocolatey and wonderful. I think the Balance Bars are great to have for breakfast on the run and to grab a quick snack before or after working out. I would highly recommend the Balance Bars."
3,I'm not sure if I would purchase the ...,"I'm not sure if I would purchase the Balance Bars again or not. They were great for a quick snack or even for breakfast, but I didn't seem to notice an extra boost of energy like I thought I might get based on the product's description. They did seem to fill me up for awhile. Mostly, I can't decide whether I like the taste. To each his own!!"
4,Good Balance Bar Flavor,"Compared to other High Protein Balance Bars and other brands of protein bars, this flavor is very good. The coffee undertones complement the standard chocolate flavor well. There is no doubt about it as you're eating: This is a protein bar, chalky flavor and all. But the coffee + chocolate does a better job than most flavors at hiding it well. If you haven't tried it, and you have a reason to be eating high protein bars try it.Look at the nutritional information, these bars do have a lot of protein (15g), but are really not all that healthy. 6 grams of fat (4 g Saturated Fat) per bar. 21 grams of carbohydrates (18 g sugar) will make this bar a non-Atkins friendly bar. Perhaps all that fat and sugar are what makes the bar taste relatively so good."
4,This is a good snack or break food. ...,"This is a good snack or break food. After my afternoon workout, it filled me up and gave me energy. It satisfied my craving for a sweet chocolate taste too. It had a good chewy texture and it gave my mouth a good workout, flavor, and chew. It was a bit high on the calorie range, but had all the nutrients to keep it healthy."
3,"The bars were pretty good. Not too chemical-tasting, ...","The bars were pretty good. Not too chemical-tasting, but a typical sports bar nonetheless. Bland. Texture of cardboard but better than most in consistency. Not sticky like Power Bars. I'd recommend them if you can accept that all sports bars invariably taste like packing material. Good protein content."
4,"This is a tasty bar, not too heavy ...","This is a tasty bar, not too heavy on the chocolate. It isn't a """"candy bar"""" or """"brownie"""" sort of texture (it's lots drier) but for heavens sake, this is a nutritional bar. If I wanted a brownie's moisture and flavor, I'd eat a brownie. For what it is -- a nutritional bar -- it's quite good. And I like the fact that the protein and fat are balanced in a way that helps me absorb the nutritional benefits. Overall, it's tasty snack that's good for me."
4,I thought this product was great because it ...,"I thought this product was great because it tasted good and the nutritional value is very high. I would really recommend this product to others -- especially those who may be in a program like Weight Watchers. I am in the Weight Watchers program and this brownie is only a 6-point item in the program. So it's wonderful to use as a snack. It tastes just like a regular brownie with nuts in it. I heated them up to enjoy them even more, so they were nice and warm and chewy."
3,sometimes there good sometimes....,"Sometimes this item comes fresh and sometimes it tastes and looks like it has been sitting around for a while, crumbly and poor tasting sometimes even try. Never had this issue when i bought at the local store. I like the deal but the quality isn't consistent almost like they send out items for subscription without any care, bottom of the barrel."
2,Too sweet,"If you like foods that are VERY sweet, you might like these bars, but for many people, they may be overpoweringly sweet. They also have a weird crunchy-ness. I do like the fact that Balance bars contain lots of protein and vitamins."
1,Yucky!,"I love the peanut butter Balance Bars. People say these are good, but I thought they were horrible. My husband and older son did not like them either."
5,The Best!,"I agree - I have tried soooooooooo many energy bars and this has got to be the best! A little chalky (they all are), but has a good taste... it's actually edible and so good for you! I genuinely like these bars!!!"
5,very good,I love these bars. Very tasty and filling at a reasonable price.I have had them on auto shipment for about 9 months and will continue.
4,"Guy Loves them, Girl Hates them","Pros:-Small-Great stats (high in protein and calories relative in size)-The Chocolate and Mocha Chip tastes Great-No chalky tasteCons:-Fiance thinks they taste awefulBefore I bought this product I always thought Balance bars were low in protein and just a womans meal supplement. Well, now they are my main protein bars and eat them all the time between meals when I am hungry.I would give these a 5 star, best nutritional/protein bars I have ever tried. No chalky taste, very smooth texture (overly smooth compared to others) however, the fiance hated them. Not sure why, but she could not even eat them, however, she loves the Cliff bar brand."
3,The taste wasn't the greatest. It tends to ...,The taste wasn't the greatest. It tends to leave an aftertaste. I found the bar to be extremely chewy but dry. I didn't notice any changes in energy levels either. The bar is ok for a quick bite when on the road with the kids to hold you over. I don't believe it's what the package says it is.
2,Don't buy food from Amazon,"I bought this 12-pack of peanut butter Balance bars and noticed some white stuff on the bars when I opened them before eating. I shaved them off with a knife. Then I went to look for Cliff bars at Amazon and noticed a bunch of reviews complaining about white stuff or staleness in the bars they ordered. Bottomline: Buy books, buy music, buy anything but food from Amazon! Esp if they're on sale -- imagine how old it must be!"
3,Good product -- poor handling,"We're big fans of the peanut butter Balance bars, but one box in our order got crushed during packing so several bars arrived with their wrappers split open."
5,balance bars,These are great. I have eaten them for several years. Sometimes for a quick breakfast or for a snack in between meals. Now I am trying to lose a few pounds and I find them to be a great snack to have when you want something a little sweet. They really curb your appetite. They are good. The honey yogurt is my all time favorite!
1,dangerous food item,We returned this item because we thought it did not taste as it does usually. We buy them all the time and the ones we bought in our grocery store after this incident were normal tasting.With food you cannot take risks
3,"I liked the chocolate raspberry flavor, but I ...","I liked the chocolate raspberry flavor, but I didn't like the texture."
2,At first I thought the Balance Bar tasted ...,"At first I thought the Balance Bar tasted like sawdust, but I sort of got used to that after awhile. The bar isn't moist enough. I need a glass of milk wash it down or it's hard to swallow. The taste was OK, but not something I'd buy really. I'd say if you're on a diet and want a nice 200-calorie lunch, get a salad with a nice low-cal dressing instead."
4,The Balance Bars that I received were very ...,"The Balance Bars that I received were very good! I really liked the flavor (naturally, chocolate raspberry fudge). They're good for people on the go or for someone who doesn't have time for a meal. Very nutritious and very filling. I'm very satisfied with these bars."
2,The only way I can describe these bars ...,"The only way I can describe these bars is with the word sweet. Too sweet, in fact. They have a good taste as long as you have a real sweet tooth. They're good on the run, but unless you're used to lots of sugar in the morning, I wouldn't recommend them for breakfast. Maybe in place of dessert though."
3,Wrong purchase -- it's OK,"I usually get the Balance Carbwell bars (in chocolate peanut butter), and I mistakenly ordered this in peanut butter flavor.Pros- huge flavor- soft / chewy textureCons- high sugar & fat- not covered in anything (it's just peanut butter throughout -- I thought there would be a hint of chocolate at least).Other:It's way too sweet for my liking (compared to the Balance Carbwell bars). I'm not use to all that sugar.. so I doubt I'll be buying this again."
2,"Not the best tasting, prefer Clif Bars","The cookie dough flavor is okay, but not the best. The texture is a little too gooey. I have only eaten a few of these bars and I am already sick of them. I got them the same time as I got some Clif bar White Chocolate Macadamia, and those are by far superior to the balance bar.Hopefully the other flavors are better than this, but I think for now I will stick with Clif bars."
2,Not-fresh,"I bought Yogurt-Honey-Peanut bars from DAB. What I received was not fresh, even though the expiration date was almost 8 months ahead. Compared to the taste of the fresh ones you can buy in your local stores, the taste of this one was really bad and it was really painful eating it. The appearance of the bar also suggested having some problems, before even tasting it.I don't think the food is preserved in conditions that would guarantee freshness, and I don't think I am going to buy from the same seller again.Note: 2 Star is just for quick delivery, nothing else."
3,Energy bars are a hard sell -- they're ...,"Energy bars are a hard sell -- they're either too sweet or too dense or too grainy or too gooey -- you get the picture. These Balance Bars do a nice job of combining flavor with nutrients and energy. The interior of the bar is dense and chewy with a nice berry taste, although it's hard to taste the berries sometimes. The yogurt covering is a great touch -- delicious and not too sweet. My roommates are split on the bars, however. One roommate loves them and plans to take them in her purse for a quick snack whenever she needs an energy boost. The other roommate, however, hates the texture and can't imagine eating one again. Overall, these bars are surprisingly good for energy bars. Just remember that you're consuming a nutritional supplement and not a candy or granola bar."
2,Incredibly chalky and cardboard like,"I have to agree with ""R.Katz"" They are incredibly chalky and cardboard like. They also have a strong dark chocolate taste. I don't particularly enjoy dark chocolate; those that do might enjoy these. The bars I received were well within their expiration date.(10 months to go) OK but certainly not the best Balance Bar flavor."
3,The Almond Brownie bar was OK. The taste ...,"The Almond Brownie bar was OK. The taste was just as good as any other power-type bar that I've tried. But it wasn't something that I'd crave. I expected it to provide me with more energy, kind of like taking a vitamin. Perhaps not that day, but the next. To be honest, I didn't notice much difference in my level of energy. With the price that they charge for purchasing a power bar, I don't think I'd recommend it to friends and family. I do think that I may purchase them again for myself though."
1,I suppose if you're just looking for fuel ...,"I suppose if you're just looking for fuel for your body or emergency food to keep in your trunk, then these would be okay. If I'd purchased this box of Balance Bars, I would've brought it back to the store for a refund. The taste was pretty bad, and the consistency was gummy/muddy. It's better if you have it with a full glass of water, although there's a very strong aftertaste. My husband took a bite and spit it out -- the same with my six year old. My two-year-old son, however, seemed to actually like it and will eat a bar as a snack if I broke it up into small pieces. I just couldn't get past the taste. I still have over a box left, which I'll dole out to my son as snacks, but it's defiantly not something I would ever buy or recommend. In fact, if someone told me they were going to buy them, I'd ask if they'd ever eaten them before and if not, I would tell them pick a different product. Big thumbs down on this one!"
3,The Almond Brownie Balance Bars have a deep ...,"The Almond Brownie Balance Bars have a deep chocolate appearance and really look luscious. However, the taste is disappointing. Although the almond pieces provide a nice crunchy feel, the bars are slightly dry, not as tasty as the appearance suggests, and they have a slight aftertaste. I will definitely keep them on hand, though, for a nutritious snack. I'll also carry them with me when I go hiking."
1,Personally I found this bar to be very ...,"Personally I found this bar to be very untasty. One bite was truly enough for me. They may be very healthy, which is great, but to me if I'm going to eat something, it has to taste good, and this doesn't meet that requirement."
3,I found that the bars had everything you ...,"I found that the bars had everything you needed vitamin and mineral wise. The taste, however, wasn't that appealing to me. It was somewhat chocolatey, but it also had that fibery taste. It did fill a void when I needed a quick meal on the go however. I think taste for taste, if you are dieting, the Slim Fast bars have a better overall taste. I'm not sure if I'd recommend this product."
4,The taste was a little disappointing but I ...,"The taste was a little disappointing but I don't like peanuts anyway. The bars were very filling and gave me a little boost. I'd say these are all that they promise, although, they're a little pricey for my wallet. I'd recommend them to anyone who likes peanuts and is looking for a bit of a pick-me-up during the day."
2,We didn't find these to be all that ...,We didn't find these to be all that tasty. They had a mealy kind of texture. If you're very very hungry they'd be okay to eat. Perhaps they just weren't suited to our family's taste buds.
4,These bars were excellent! The texture and flavor ...,"These bars were excellent! The texture and flavor were great. The ingredients are good for you and you don't have to feel guilty like you do when eating a candy bar. I would recommend this product for a quick, filling, pick-me-up snack. You need to have a beverage with it, however. This was much creamier than other products like this."
4,This product has very satisfying texture and I ...,"This product has very satisfying texture and I found it quite filling. Not everyone I shared it with liked it immediately, as it has a slightly unusual taste at first. The sweetness of the bar comes out as you chew it, however. The pleasant fruit flavor reminded me alternately of raisins and strawberries. I particularly enjoyed the creamy yogurt coating. The balance of nutrients is excellent for a healthy snack or even a small meal when time is short. I was unaware of this type of product and I'm glad to find out about it."
2,"Overall, I didn't like this product. It has ...","Overall, I didn't like this product. It has a very thick and gooey center that's very hard to swallow unless I have a lot of water to wash it down with. The flavor wasn't too bad, but if they could just change it so wasn't so gummy... I wouldn't recommend this product to my family and friends."
5,yummy energy,"I had tried a bunch of different flavors of different brands. These are among the best tasting tasting energy bars out there. I also compared the nutrition facts of many. Again, these are among the best. I highly recommend them. I use them as a snack in between meals. I try my best to stick with eating every 3 hours to keep my metabolism working at full speed throughout the day. These have a low enough calorie count to work for that purpose. I don't use them as a meal replacement.They arrived in a very timely manner. The only flavor that tops this one is the s'mores by balance bars as well."
1,Balance Bars,"The bars I recevied were past the ""Best when used by"" date by. Also, the bars were the original formula and not the new formula."
4,A book that is good for any collector.,This book was written by my wife's Great-grandfather and deserves to be read by everyone.
4,good times.. had by all,"i really liked this cd, before it burnt up.i use to dj and this cd was a nice little sneaky surprise to throw in... if someone requested a certian song from the 80's, i'd play it off this disk, and they still danced.i actually liked ""space age love soing"" better then the original.sorry!anyways, it is a nice little add to any goth/80's music admirees."
1,Dissappointed,This remix of the original is terrible. It sounds like the bass is clipping similar to trying to play it through an old pocket radio. My original analog cassette sounds better. My advise to all of you is to try and find an old Album or cassette and transfer it to a CD.
4,Great album! So So reproduction.,"I originally purchased this album back when it was an album and not a CD. Ah the seventies! Feathered hair and porn mustaches. As far as tight musicianship and harmonies go, you'll be hard pressed to find it's equal. The songs are very ""hook"" intensive and jam packed with a sort of bourbon street funk. Sad but, IMO the group never quite recaptured the genius of this effort on their follow up albums. One negative: The sound quality of this particular reproduction is somwewhat suspect."
5,"Easy to use, bad plastic","The plastic material of this product feels like taken out of a really cheap kids toy... but thats the only bad imprresion I found on it, it works great and the bleeder valve is awesome..."
3,OK- beware the plastic,"I am just so so on this purchase. The gauge works fine, however as others have stated... I feel if I dropped or stepped on this that it would be history. I expected more and now wish I had bought one from my local Auto store. This is fine for a spare, but not as durable as I had hoped."
5,Amazing Technology . . .,"Geeze what do you expect? Yes it's a $100 toy and being capable of flight means it's going to be light and delicate.But make no mistake: It is an amazing toy - flat out impossible when I was young.So have a care, realize what you're buying and have fun."
3,needs extra props and time,"This high-powered machine is a lot of fun but needs a long learning curve to learn to fly it. During that learning time, there's a high probability you will damage it. It should come with more spare propellers and places to buy new ones."
4,It's awesome...when it works,"This is the best ""RC plane"" if you can call it that, I've ever seen!It ""drives"", swims and even flies!! The controls are fairly easy if you stay on NOVICE. Theres a button that starts the engines, so don't worry about accidentally removing a finger.PRO+Flying, driving, swimming+Control+Charging time (not extremely short but its good)CON+Durability (especially the propellers)+Playing time (With full power about 15 mins)+PriceThat's about all. I reccomend ages 13 and up for this ""toy""."
1,a total piece of ____,"go ahead, ignore all the other reviews, hear thisyou get one extra propellerthat goes on the first daysecond dayanother propeller breaksout 100$"
2,"One word: ""This is not good!""","If you are in the market for a DVD with terrible acting, bad picture quality, crappy sound and below average ""Playboy"" models, then I have found the perfect disc for you!The disc is a compilation of 9 ""erotic stories"" from the industries ""newest, cutting edge film makers"". I bought the idea that, sure, Playboy could put a bunch of amusing stories together and it could be good, with decent acting, erotic situations and hot Playboy models. They failed on all three. The models are mediocre at best, and when it comes down to it, that's why we buy Playboy videos.I paid $25 for this crap, and I think Playboy may have already covered their production costs for the entire DVD with my lone purchase."
2,interesting but ultimately disappointing,"I'd heard only good things about this book, so being a pkd fan, I expected an intriguing read. For the first 80 pages or so, it was, but after that it drifts into less pleasant territory. The dialogue at points is clunky and unnatural, and sometimes the character's motives are not believable (for example, Charley wanting to kill his wife; Jack's amusing but unjustified creating a ""story"" for Charley). Despite the fact that some of this is drawn from the author's life (faye is based on one of his real-life wives), it feels like he doesn't really know these characters. They serve the plot rather than vice versa. Also pkd's strengths -- his humor and elaborate imagination -- are tied up.Knopf requested a rewrite for this novel circa 1960 and sadly the author never revised it, despite not finding a publisher for it until 1975. Oh well, I suppose I'll have to pick up ""three stigmata"" or ""dr bloodmoney"" for my pkd fix."
2,Be aware....,"This company-Fast-Pak Trading Inc. locates in New Jersey. We used to buy honey they are distributing here in Brooklyn for couple years now. Manuka is our favorite,but in past year its price just skyrocketed,so we switched to Kamahi and Thyme.We love Kamahi-it has distinctive taste,not as many American honeys we were trying for years. BUT!!! Last time we bought Kamahi from the same Fast-Pak Trading Inc. in the local store-it was different honey! Although label says it's the same,but I know the taste and can say for sure-they put something different in the jar. It's more like clover honey,something cheaper and less tasty. So,be aware of it,when you're buying honey from this company.Other than that-Kamahi is great honey."
2,Nope,"The best part of this movie, for me anyway (a longtime JAG fan), was watching Catherine Bell run - that's it... After reading a few reviews, I was disappointed."
4,Won't win an oscar but...,"Is still relatively entertaining. Folks, this film wasn't made to revolutionize the film industry or have a long lasting impression on the viewer. This film was a made for TBS production thats basic goal was to entertain the audience for two hours. With this goal in mind, the film succeeded. From start to finish, the movie is entertaining and fast paced, all the while feeding the mind with little tidbits about how altering the present could change the future. A Good film in my opinion."
4,Thrill Seekers,I watched this movie years ago when it first come out and lost it was glad to see someone having it and was able to buy it again ty
4,Casper Van Dien...the glue for the movie,"If it wasn't for Casper Van Dien, I don't think I would like this movie near as much. It had a lot of action and what not, but the plot left some holes and questions that I would have liked filled/answered. If you like time-travel movies then this movie is pretty good, but it's more about the consequences of disrupting the future and/or past."
5,A fine yet underrated album from the 80s,"This is a highly polished collection of well written songs from the clean-cut Johnny Hates Jazz. Think Spandau Ballet, When In Rome, ABC. Pleasant and easy to listen to. A great addition to your collection if you like 80s pop music."
1,Dietz L80609 Lantern,"This lantern is like a child's toy. It is very cheaply made (tin like), we would have been afraid to put lamp oil in it and use it as intended - a lantern. The filling cap was made worse than a soda cap, there were bent parts and it was very lightweight, not as expected. Our 40 year old Dietz lantern is made out of heavy metal and is very sturdy, nothing like this one."
2,Wrong Item,The site says that this book was a hardcover. What actually came was a paperback. I ordered the book specifically because it was advertised as a hardcover.The book was returned with the exceptional help of Amazon Custumer Service.I was truly dismayed - I like to collect hardcovers of this particular writer.
3,"Thought-provoking, but mostly wrong","In this book, Joyce sets out on an extremely ambitious mission: To show that morality as we know it is worthless because it is only a side-effect of our evolutionary history.He clearly knows his facts about evolution, and the book is an engaging and thought-provoking read; but the overall argument rests upon an extremely silly premise, namely: ""If we do X because we evolved to do X, then we must be wrong in doing X."" By the same reasoning, not only morality, but sex, science, and even basic cognitive processes like vision and logic must be false.Yes, we evolved to be moral---this is because morality is in fact a true reflection of the state of the universe, and our evolution adapted us to that fact."
3,Too many words used to tell this story,"Intriguing plot and personable (if not truly memorable)characters BUT, I found myself racing through so many unneeded words--maybe the publisher asked for a book of so and so many words or pages? I also found the outcome for the 'bad guy' to be totally unbelievable given the final body count and his stated intent. Not a bad beach or pool book by any means, but this husband and wife writing team can and have done so much better with other offerings in the past."
3,Five in a Row,"Emily Doyle, a single mother and computer teacher, has acquired a dangerous secret admirer who has the ability to take control of any car remotely and turn it into a weapon to kill the person inside. At first, the rash of deaths seems random, but Ben Colter, chief investigator, realizes Emily is the key. Together, they race time to find out who the madman is, before his ""love"" flips over to hatred.*** This is perhaps Ms. Coffey's most suspensefully frightening novel to date. Tightly coherent action that seems all too real will hold your attention from the first page to the end. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
4,A fine read for students of the thirteenth century church.,"This book deals with the origins of the Franciscan, Dominican, Augustinian, and Carmelite friars (along with other minor mendicant orders)and the foundations of mendicancy. It is a great source of information for investigating the current trends in the church at large in the 12th-14th centuries."
2,A stretch,"Greetings. I was dissapointed with this product. It does have some fantastic music, yet is lacking the humour that I had wished to hear. Frefa Payne may just not have been meant to produce commedy. She did a wonderful job, ( as always), with her voice and style, it is just that the humour was not there."
3,Scratches easily,"I bought this mirror for barbering. It's very sensitive and prone to sctaching.I wouldn't say that this mirror is a bad mirror, I just would say it's not meant to use to often, and you should keep it away from things that may scratch it."
5,HOTTT Chocolate,"For those who LOVE this topic, this book rates at the TOP! Superb drawings with very high degree of eroticism make this a ""must"" on your reading list."
3,"Nice pics, but not so hot.","This book is good if you are a lover of black men and gaytoons. It is of fine quality paper and nice art work, but would be better if it highlighted work by several artists. I enjoyed the book, but went through it once and probably won't look at it again, unlike other such books I've purchased by Tom of Finland, the Hun, or others."
2,Pick a different album. Good songs but ALL Live.,"Simply put it's all the GOOD songs, and the Great voice of Roger, BUT !!!! All of the recordings are Live performances (why doesn't Amazon tell us this???), with the expected loss of quality, and not his best arrangements. Best bet is to pick a different album for studio versions of these songs."
4,Artistic Mayhem,"Dario Argento's ""Tenebre"" is a reminder of what genre films can be when guided by genuine artistic vision. The plot, which is well-constructed, has the benefit of an able cast bringing it to fruition. I doubt that Anthony Franciosa has ever been better as an author who finds himself embroiled in a murder mystery that seems lifted from his latest book. Guiliano Gemma, John Saxon and Daria Nicolodi provide charming and well-cast support. What truly raises this film above the average however, are the stunning images of mayhem that Argento constructs. His camerawork is sumptuous! If you've never sampled his work before, ""Tenebre"" is an excellent place to begin."
3,Everything You'd Expect in an Argento Film!,"This has everything you'd expect in an Argento film: a wide range of acting quality, characters who say and do things that don't make sense considering their situations, a muddled mystery, great-looking women (i.e. victims), colorful and stylish photography, special makeup effects which are only sometimes effective, and great murder setpieces. I actually jumped twice which is two more times than when watching most recent horror movies. Somehow it all works out to an enjoyable DVD. Nice widescreen transfer, minimal extras."
3,Not Argento's best,"While there is a lot to enjoy in Tenebre, including Argento's direction, the score and brutal murders, ultimately this murder-mystery is sunk by an awful script, bad dubbing and a harsh, garish look that hasn't aged well at all. For those who aren't Argento fans, it will be hard to stay engaged as the murders occur, since there is little to no tension and the mystery is paper-thin. Also, without one redeeming or sympathetic character, it's hard to care, much less swallow the outrageous implausibilities of the story.You'll find yourself wishing Argento had hired a good screenwriter to tell this convoluted tale. Instead it just drags on, with endless talking-heads and foul red-herring."
4,Bloody Diverting Giallo,"First off: what's up with the misspelled title? It is TENEBRAE, not TENEBRE. I suppose some graphics worker was asleep at the wheel...I bought this in lieu of the full box set because it's easily the best film offered, and because I have the others in some form or other. TENEBRAE has no supernatural content, but is a regular giallo murder story. The difference is in the trademark Argento execution, making TENEBRAE far more entertaining than most giallos I've seen. Fun performances by Tony Franciosa and ubiquitous John Saxon, and, need I add: plenty of blood. It's no SUSPIRIA, but Argento fans should certainly have this DVD. It's of the customary Anchor Bay quality, and the special material, while nothing to set the world on fire, is a nice addition."
1,"Unless You're Into a Lot of Senseless Gore, A Terrible Movie","As a fan of crime & thriller movies, I am not into senseless gore unless there is a message somewhere in the story that doesn't make the gore senseless (e.g., a Clockwork Orange, Natural Born Killers). There is no such redeeming message in this movie. Can't believe Tony Franciosa played the role that he did."
4,The second film of Dario Argento's..I watched..,"Where do I start? Before I watched this film I was full of hype. I had heard many great things about it. I sat down full of excitement and pressed play. The opening was really good, just like almost everything else in this movie. The only major problem I had with this movie was the ending. I hated it. I never would have guessed who the killer was. Well actually I guessed it at the begining but thought that would just be stupid if that person would murder people.The music is so incredible! I listen to it all the time. It goes well with murder scenes. The gore in this movie is amazing! It looks so real and gross. I love how the blood comes spraying out of an arm that was chopped off! This movie was a good one but did not live up to the expectations I had for it. I enjoyed it none the less."
5,Agatha Christie Gone Mad,"When I first saw Tenebrae Ididn't know what I was to make of it. After all it opens with a shot of a book clearly written in Italian that is followed by a close up of the same book only this time in English.Dogdy. But as soon as the extremely infectious theme tune kicks in you know where you are. Cheese town. The main character Peter Neil , a writer whose thrillers are the inspiration for a series of murders, somehow makes you think that William Shatner somewhat under played Captain Kirk! There is so much to enjoy here :red herrings,bad clothes,gory murders,some extremely unnerving moments,hilarious bit parts(Johnny the PA is Fred from Scooby Doo made flesh!)and the sense that the director is trying to send you mad guessing who the murderer is.The whodunnit feel gives the impression this is what a modern Agatha Christie novel would be like.....if Miss Marple were to get an axe in the back come finale time."
4,Another gory slasher flick from Argento!,"Though not the directors best, this is never the less a good film. A writer is drawn into a nightmare world when a sadistic killer start's to copycat murders from his new bestseller, Tenebrae. Splattered in gore, the film's only downfall is it's sunny and bright atmosphere, which leaves the film without genuine scares."
1,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ,TERRIBLE TRANSFER!!","I HAVE BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME FOR A BLU-RAY TENEBRAE,AND THEN I GET THIS!!!HORRIBLE GHOSTIN,FUZZY,PROMINENT GRAIN THRU THE ENTIRE PICTURE!

IF ANYONE FINDS A DEFINITIVE,ALL-REGION TENEBRAE BLU-RAY,PLEASE POST."
4,Anchorbay's re-release of Tenebre,"Often praised as Argento's best, I really don't see it. It's a decent movie that tries to be the epitome of a giallo, and in some ways, it works because it's somewhat self-aware of it. Cool death scenes, crazy twist ending, scored by Goblin... that's all you need right there.Now on to the technical specs... the film is widescreen, with 5.1 sound, which I'll be honest: I didn't quite see what was so special about the surround sound of this movie. There weren't a lot of scenes that really utilized the effect. It's in english, but there's also a mono italian track.The main features are an audio commentary with Dario Argento, music composer, and some journalist, and 3 featurettes. I guess it's your pretty standard dvd. Worthy presentation of the film, extras... but I think it could stand to be a little less than $10."
3,A terrifying vision from the Italian master of horror.,"While not the best work of Italian horror master Dario Argento, Tenebrae does contains all of the directors nuances and operatic violence that has made him one of the more respected and accomplished filmmakers in the horror genre. The story of Tenebrae is somewhat muddled due to bad translation but it dwells on the themes of murder, hero worship, and madness as a terrible string of murders occur when a popular author appears in Rome to promote his new book. The murders are actually the high points of the film and seem to be better choreographed and edited then the rest of the movie. Especially 'pleasent' is the ""paint the wall red"" scene which will go down in film history as the bloodiest axe murder ever filmed. All in all, Tenebrae is not a bad film and does live up to expectations. Any fan of Argento and his work should rush out and buy this film."
2,Didn't care for this movie at all,"I was looking for something a bit different in the horror genre and scanned the user ratings for this movie and thought I would spend the money on a rental. Well, the price wasnt steep but the movie was dreadful. Poorly shot, sound quality was poor, what little special effects there are were childishly done and not a single person in the cast could act.This is the type of movie that scares Americans away from ""foreign films"". This movie is simply dreadful."
4,Beautiful Women and Well Staged Killings,"Tenebre is the kind of movie that will keep you guessing until the very end.The killings are done with style and gore and unlike the horror movies of today, the plot is not an afterthought.So if you like a slasher movie that will actually make sense of the violence then see Tenebre."
4,A gruesome thriller.,"It's good to finally see a decent copy of Tenebre(previously only available in a severely butchered form entitled Unsane) commercially available in the U.S.. It is a VERY violent film that may turn some people off. However, for those who like their horror wild, bloody, amd artistically directed, this is the film for you.The story is well constructed and easily involves the viewer despite the fact that the visuals often overwhelm the plot details. Argento's flair for wringing menace out of ordinary things and situations is in evidence throughout. Danger and foreboding seem to lurk in every corner, threatening to leap out at any moment.As usual, the film is a feast for the eyes and ears. The virtuoso camera work, rich colors, set designs, and excellent score by Goblin members Simonetti, Morante, and Pignatelli all work together to push this film into classic territory.See this film!"
3,Tenebre,"Being a self proclaimed 'huge Argento fiend', I found this movie to be amongst the absolute worst of his work. Don't get me wrong, it is watchable (although completely predictable from the outset) and does have some creepy Argento moments. It doesn't have much to offer in the way of what most look for in his films. I read that it was supposed to take on the look of a 'Columbo' type detective program, but it just doesn't work for me. Argentos' best work comes when it is dark and brooding. This movie becomes exactly what I hated about slasher flicks. And in reality, the main reason why I like his films is because he did something to the typical slasher genre and made it into art. Much like his mentor Leone did with the western. As a fan, it is indespensible of course. Maybe calling it his absolute worst is harsh, but in my opinion.....it is.For completists and fans of movies like ""Dressed To Kill"" only. Go after 'Suspiria' or 'Deep Red' if you are looking for a jump on point of Argentos work."
3,"Not Argento's Best, But Stil Quite Fun","Dario Argento is undeniably one of the best directors in the world. His visuals are stunning and his intrepid and innovative camera-work is unique and stimulating, exposing the viewer to the potential filmmaking has to offer. ""Tenebre"" is full of classic Argento directing, including a brilliant steadycam shot which took days to set up. Also, this movie contains enough grisly giallo scenes to satisfy the experienced gorehound. However, ""Tenebre"" lacks a dynamic script and thus the plot suffers some, presenting muddy characters whom we don't really care about. Though most of Argento's films are distancing and somewhat cold, ""Suspiria"" and ""Phenomena"" do more justice to his limitless talent."
1,piece of junk,"This tray arrived broken, and looked as though it had been shipped from the factory broken. ""Wood"" is a stretch as the product used to make this is very cheap. The company, Stacks and Stacks was difficult to deal with. Overall, a big ZERO."
5,Great product!,This product is just wonderful! I have a wide drawer for my flatware and I love the expandable feature of this product. 3 sections are stationery and the other 2 sections are expandable and you can make it whatever width you want. The corners and all the joints were very well made as well as the entire unit. I'm about ready to buy a couple more for my other drawers. Great product - you'll love the expandable features of it. Doesn't look cheap like the plastic inserts or other wood units that don't expand. Really love it.
4,Good collection of short articles,"I haven't tried Bert Sugar before but I will buy more of his books after reading this one.The book consists of a collection of his articles over the years, some of the stories are short, some are fairly lengthy.I think that the strength in Sugar is not so much his readable writing style, it is the way he occasionally adds little nuggets of information on certain boxers. He is a breezy author and his books are not difficult to read at all. I liked the stories on the fighters especially John L Sullivan.I would have liked to have seen more modern stuff in the book as that was where Sugar stands out, he knows the inside story on some fighters.The best section is Chapter 1: Rants and Raves - this is how the book could have been presented, a series of boxing articles.He would write a good auto-biography."
4,A 9-year old's first review,"I got this item one day after my birthday but I got this at Target. I t does make a lot of noise, but that's OK. Your parents might buy this for you but, they will ask you to turn off the sound by pressing the sound button on the bottom of this item. If you don't press anything in 4 minutes, it will turn off automaticly but your game is saved. This thing is very cool. Requires 4 AA batteries which are not included.- Cristian Mojica"
1,rap-Man!,"Worst toy ever! Why? If you've ever played the real pacman, this will make sense to you: 1. It has a ""scrolling feature"" where the board is divided up into 8 parts and you jump from one part of the board (screen) to the next part of the board (screen) and don't know whether there's a ghost there or not. 2. You have to change direction when pacman hits the square. Too early, or late, and pacman sits there waiting to be eaten by ghosts.This is going to get re-gifted at my first opportunity."
1,review,"received item in a timely matter, never played still in box. cant rate something that you have not tried out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Great!,"Excellent amplifier / speaker for fairly specific space....ie shelf under or over TV, and being really honest it rarely achieves real surround (other than during set up!). But it has a deep rich sound, much better than the TV speakers (a 36 inch panasonic plasma), so its worth the money to save on wires and speakers everywhere. easy set up and menu and pretty good range of sound effects."
3,An upgrade from TV speakers with a high WAF,WAF= wife acceptance factor.Nice clean installation has aesthetic benefits.I have this mated to the YST-II subwoofer and it sounds much better than the TV speakers. The soundstage is much wider than the TV speakers. I have my TV/speakers in a corner installation. The frontstereo separation is less than a two speaker (4.5' spread) stereo setup--but the sound from surround channels is distinct and appears to come from a wider space than a stereo system provides.The tones are much richer than TV speakers.Has quite a few adjustable settings. Was able to improve performance with manual tweaks to the auto set-up.BE sure to use a subwoofer.I suspect it works better in a center wall installation in a 4-sided room.I have surround sound in my basement and this unit does not provide the same spatial effect.I was able to purchase the YSP-800 for $349 plus $130 for SW in an after Christmas sale. I don't think it is a good value at retail.
4,Good product for money,"For under $10, this is a good bag. Just don't carry with handle. Use shoulder strap all the time. Wish to have a pocket outside of the flip."
1,Moon Missions,"Don't you all think, we should go to the moon first, before we talk about going back? Folks, we did not go to the moon."
4,A slight inaccuracy,"The book sounds great, but the bio describes Schmitt as ""the 12th and last human to have stepped on the Moon."" Schmitt was the 12th human to step onto the lunar surface, but it is generally accepted that Gene Cernan is the last human to have walked on the moon since he left the lunar surface and re-entered the LEM after Schmitt.Note: My 4-star review is arbitrary and stupid. I don't want to rate a book I haven't read and Amazon won't allow me to post this comment without assigning a rating. 4 stars is the current average review."
4,Underrated Gem from Minneapolis' Past,"John's Black Dirt were one of the best bands on the early Nineties Minneapolis music scene. Sadly, they were pretty obscure, even by local music standards, and didn't get the attention they deserved. If you missed them back then, don't miss this CD. The music is an intricate mix of punk energy, Sonic Youth influences and literary allusions. It's loud and aggressive, but also very intelligent. Favourite songs here:""Buick""--bittersweet pop""Cloud in Pants""--Loud, loud, loud, but catchy as can be.""Lights Flashing""--this one got local radio airplay back then, kind of dreamy.This album really captures the sound of a lost era in Minneapolis indie rock--loud growlers mixed with interesting, textured slower material. All in all, slightly difficult listening sometimes, but very rewarding in the end."
5,Larkin's The Book of Revelation,"I am an avid reader of books of Biblical Prophecy, and I feel that Clarence Larkin's ""The Book of Revelation"" is the best on the book of Revelation. Mr. Larkin provides charts for the student, and does verse by verse analysis of the book. If you want to study the Book of Revelation. I would submit Clarence Larkin's ""The Book of Revelation"" as your first tool of study."
2,Great Book But Horrible Spelling & Formatting,"This books appears to have been scanned. A TON of the words are misspelled, and the formatting is messed up. There are numbers and special characters mixed in with the words. Usually it is obvious what word it is supposed to be, but other times it's not clear.Here are some examples:""DanieFs"" instead of ""Daniel's""""i>>"" instead of ""in"""">men"" instead of ""amen""""SevcaJieth"" instead of ""Seventieth""""XmiJS"" instead of ??????It averages out to be about one mistake per page. The content of the book is excellent. Unfortunately how it was scanned / converted did not go very well. It should have been corrected somehow. I recommend a different Kindle version of this book."
5,The Book of Revelation,"Book arrived safely before predicted time and in excellent condition. Author is very concise, and this book contains much data to make a forthcoming Bible study for my Sunday school class interesting and informative."
4,How About Other Books?,"Fist of all, this book was great, I don't have anything against it. The only thing I hate is how Rafael repeatly doubts Victoria. But like my title suggests, I'm curious about her other books. I read all the reviews of her other books and most people like them. There are also people who don't. Before I read them(the reviews), I was planning to go buy more of her books. Now I'm not so sure, her books sound like they sure have a lot of cruelty and rape in them!"
1,Moonspun Magic,"This book, as the other books in this series, would have been a good book - it was a good story, if it hadn't been turned into pornography. Descriptions of what goes on in bed should remain behind closed doors."
2,"Leave This One For The ""Yard"" Birds","Despite the poor sound quality, the first six songs are decent... leading the listener to believe that he or she is going to have an ""okay"" album... this is not true. The remaining tracks suck peanut butter backwards threw a straw -- bad sound quality, poor album choices, and equally poor artistry."
5,Kindergarten Christmas Carols,"The Statler Brothers was the first group I ever saw in concert - my mother says I actually asked to go along with the family (I couldn't have been more than about eight)! I remember singing ""Who Do You Think"", which tells about the Christmas story, to my kindergarten class - the teacher probably asked for Christmas carols and I've never been one to sing the old favorites at any time, so it must have started there!This is a great Christmas album and a must for any collection!"
5,blue willow,I have my grandmother's blue willow dishes and have been looking for a colinder and I was so happy to find a colinder with the blue willow pattern. Thank you!
3,To Much Money,"I bought a PS3 80Gb for $399. with 2 controllers and 2 games, I can play all games from PS1 - PS3. So what makes this 60 GB unit worth almost $700.sounds crazy if you ask me, then if you don't know anything about the unit and it breaks down your paying more to fix, I think your best not to buy these units for such crazy prices make them drop their prices, and if you do get a PS3 that won't do the backwards play you can fix it so it does, RIP OFF for this kind of money it's only a game and they are playing off the people's stupidity so as long as there's stupid people they'll be able to sell these for so much."
1,RIP-OFF!!,"You would have no more than 10% of a brain (of the part you use) to buy this. You can get one with 20 more gb for $500 less. Unless you think you're going to buy this and keep it unopened for a long time and try to sell it in the future, since the 60gb are not being made anymore. But even then it won't be worth $900. That is outrageous."
5,Life After Life: A story of Rage and Redemption.,"""Life After Life is a thought-provoking book with a powerful message that explores the inner struggles of growing up in the South in the seventies. Evans, a brillant young man, from a well established Middle Class family, made some poor choices, during his teenager years and later that led to trouble with the law.With the love and support of parents, family, and others, plus through his writing he was able to find a new path in life.. This book should serve as an inspiration to others in like situation. A Must Read!!! Alice T. Bigelow- Danville, Virginia"
4,A MUST READ FOR ANY CHILD OF THE 70'S!!,"A MOVIE YOU CAN READ!!!!This book is some of the most dynamic, vividly written non-fiction I have read in such a long, long time!...One scene after another puts you right there...you are a part of Evan's story...rooting for his eventual redemption all the way! The mother who never gave up on him..how her love carried him through his prison ordeals, what it's like to live in prison above the electric chair...Finally, an inside view of the Panthers from one of their own...Aside from bestseller lists..when will it be made into a movie?...one thinks of ""Antwone Fisher"", ""The Hurricane""... who will play Evans?"
4,REDEMPTION RINGS TRUE!,"""Life After Life"" is the compelling story of a disaffected young black man who was misguided about his ability to change the racist injustices of society...persevering to survive 20 years incarceration in the criminal justice system...along the journey writing this seminal creation...destined to be a bestseller...a must for anyone working to reform the present criminal justice system, seeking the key to motivate a developing manchild..or redeeming one already gone astray."
5,I'm buying this for others too...,"I purchased this book on a whim. I was worried about some of the comments that questioned the doctrine presented. I didn't need to worry. This book does an awesome job of presenting the ""story"" of the Bible in a way that makes God's Glory & Grace and His eternal plan even more clear. This is the first time I have seen the ""war"" between good & evil handled in such a God honoring way. I am reading this book out loud with my teenage son and it's like his Grandpa is talking with him about these important truths. Satan really can try all he wants... God will always emerge victorious. In fact, the battle is already finished - Jesus is the way, the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through him. I highly recommend this book."
4,MUSIC TO DRIVE TO,"I'm not a big metal/rock fan, but this is a great soundtrack. It's great to jump on the highway and put this CD in. Before I know it I'm driving 90 miles an hour and swerving in and out of traffic. It's got a good mixture of tracks that for the most part are very enjoyable. I haven't seen the movie (I didn't like the first one), but after listening to this soundtrack several times I'm more willing to watch it."
3,Trailer Soundtrack,Wat is the son of the trailer when Alice is going down of the building with a rope
3,"It's good, but not the best And missing an important song","When the Whole CD came out online were you can listen to it before it came out i liked a few of the songs, the cure isn't the cure i grew up with, slipknot is nothing special, and well everything else is what it is. Now my biggest dissapointment about this album was it didn't include the song from the trailer the have (which is Papa Roach - Not Listening) I like that song more than anything else on the CD and it's not on the CD. So if you buy this CD don't expect to like the entire album but their are a few songs that stick out......Should have included Papa Roach that song is awsome."
2,you don't know anything about good european music,"I'm sure almost 90% of you who are saying HIM is not a good band are American... You American people don't know anything about good music, or good things in general. You live in your own world! HIM is the best metal band and ""Join me in death"" is a very beautiful song, maybe too good to you. Scandinavian music is good but... do you know where Finland is? Do you know where Europe is located? You think USA is the only nation in the world. You don't understand the quality of European things. You don't understand...I feel very proud to be European, yes!"
4,Best Bang for the Buck!,"This is the perfect low-impact workout if you are looking to stay in shape without going crazy building a lot of muscle. Gilad is very motivating, and I have achieved very good results over the years. If you are only about 20 lbs overweight and in fairly good shape, you will see results in 2 weeks if you do at least 20 minutes of the tape 4 times a week or more."
5,Snow White,"I bought this book for my girlfriend,she was very impressed with it.I reccommend this book to all children.It was fun to color and kept her busy for quite awhile."
1,sloppy linguistics,"Rather than review the stories, I think it is more important to note that while the English versions might be grammatically correct, the Russian versions are way out of whack. My wife is from Russia, and she has noted more errors than should ever occur in any book. I can only assume that the writer of the Russian version was a student of the language rather than a native of Russia. I strongly suggest that you avoid using this book as a platform for for learning the language."
2,Dionne Warwick Live Forever Gold,I really wanted this to be a great DVD concert. It just wasnt I was disappointed. It was an outdoor concert and pouring rain. Dionne did sing her mechanical songs. They werent beautiful to hear. Her voice is much harder than before. It was still great to hear. I would get her about 20 years earlier than this DVD.Excellent delivery and DVD was in perfect shape. No problems in this area.
1,Why is this toy $450.00?,"While looking for a sturdy toy for my 2 yr old grand nephew I was attracted to this. However, for the life of me I can't figure out why they are charging $450.00 for it! Who in their right mind would pay that much money for a little boy to play with? Good grief!"
5,Fisher Price does it again!,We've owned a few Little People toys and this is one of the best. What a cute idea. My son has learned that it can be a step stool and it has held up to the test. His favorite part is the ramps. The sounds are cute and not loud at all. I would definatley recommend this for any Little People fan!
5,A fun toy for infants to preschoolers,"I have 3 children ages 1, 3, and 5 who love this toy. Not only does it get used with the Little People but it also is used with other toys. My 1 year old loves the sounds and is able to put the people into the cars. It is so sturdy that it withstands his climbing all over it and it does not tip over on those occasions when he decides to stand up and hold onto it. My 3 year old daughter loves to play with the Little People that came with it and she loves the video that came with ours. My 5 year old likes to use it for staging battles with his green Army men and their planes and it occasionally becomes a hideout for the Superfriends action figures or Matchbox cars.It has just enough electronic sounds to be fun but not to take away from the kids' imaginations. With such a wide appeal and so many ways to use it, this toy is a great value! Way to go Fisher-Price."
4,Garage a hit,My son got this for his 2nd birthday and it was an absolute HIT!! very durable and pretty easy to assemble - he didn't quite know what to make of some of some of the gadgets - ie: the car wash - but we don't leave the house without one of the cars.
1,AMAZON IS A RIP OFF,"AFTER ORDERING THIS ITEM WITH PRIME SHIPPING (SUPPOSEDLY FREE), I RECEIVED MY CONFIRM EMAIL WHICH CHARGED ME $10 SHIPPING. THEN, AFTER RECEIVING THE ITEM FROM WALMART, THE RECIPT FROM WALMART STATED THAT THE TRUE PRICE WAS $29.88! IF YOU WANT TO GET RIPPED OFF LIKE ME , ORDER THIS FROM AMAZON FOR $30 MORE THAN THE ACTUAL PRICE. IF NOT, ORDER DIRECTLY FROM WALMART."
3,Fun toy but an assembly nightmare!!!!,"Unfortunately I gave this toy a lower rating due to the ungodly assembly process. Pieces do not snap together easily, the screws are very hard to screw in (who knew this thing needed screws????) and the picture directions are ridiculous. Thank God my son loved the toy or it would have been a wasted 30 minutes putting it together. If you have time to kill then it's worth it but I'd rather spend my time doing something else...like poking my eyes with forks."
4,grandmother's view point,"Bought this for our grandson's first birthday. It was a big hit. He not only enjoyed the box as all one year olds do, but, enjoyed making the cars and people go up and down the devices on the garage. Very safe. Once put together, our one year old did not tear it apart. Enjoyed watching him converse with the little people in his language. It was very good."
3,Dispelling the price difference question,"Why is this one so expensive compared to the $30 dollar one else where? Because it is not the same one! Notice the little dog on the box of this one, it shows the difference. Assuming this one does come with the ""touch and feel"" dog, it was a ""exclusive with touch and feel dog"" edition. Other than that, it appears to be about the same as the cheaper one. Note that this one can be found for around $60 dollars elsewhere, however."
4,Pylepro PDBT78 Supertweeter,"I recently installed four(4)of these tweeters as upgrades to my car audio system, and they sound great. Admittedly, these are not for everyone, and by themselves, may not win that sound quality competition. But who plays tweeters by themselves? They form part of a soundstage, and while regular tweeters sacrifice their quality at high spl volumes eventually being overrun by the mids and bass, these maintain their sql with very good power handling. Perfect for those big systems.What else could you ask for?"
4,Informative and readable,I'm interested in this topic because of my experience in dealing with a family member who has used tales of illness and hardship for years to get support and money and get out of trouble that he brought on himself. Reading this book helped me to comprehend that his schemes and scams are not all that far-fetched or uncommon among practitioners of fraud. I would have liked to have had more case histories and info specifically on malingering.
4,Zyliss can opener,Works OK after you read the instructions. Hard to get the lid off after can has been opened.
3,Not an intuitive piece of equipment,"We bought this can opener after seeing it in action at a friend's house. After having it a few months, we still have to take instruction book in hand to remove a top from a can. I'm not sure it's worth the time or money."
5,awesome,"THE SANTA LETTER WAS BEAUTIFUL AND MY GRANDDAUGHTER WAS SO HAPPY WHEN SHE RECEIVED IT IN THE MAIL. SHE COULD NOT GET OVER THE FACT THAT SANTA KNEW SO MUCH ABOUT HER, HER BEST FRIEND AND THE KARAOKE SHE WANTED SO MUCH ANDTHAT HE MADE HER WISH COME TRUE. I AM VERY HAPPY I ORDERED THE LETTER AND WILL DO IT AGAIN NEXT YEAR FOR MY OTHER GRANDCHILDREN."
4,claustrophobic zombie nightmare,"my first bava/argento film. it got me pretty nervous at the time (it was 10 years ago. nothing seems to scare me these days.). no plot. lots of gore. the heavy metal music may get on your nerves if your not a fan. real nightmare quality and relentless. don't try to make sense of the logistical flaws, just go with it."
1,"Do all films with ""Demon"" in the title stink?","I am a huge Argento fan, but come on folks...this movie just stinks. There's more corn in this flick than the State of Kansas. The single entertainment value this film holds is that it provides a medium for a group of drunken men or women to polk fun at something. There are maybe one or two admirable scenes in which Argento's uncanny editing and camera work shine. Otherwise its a feast for the idiots; green blood, bad make-up and all. Definately not one to purchase for the collection."
1,dumb demons!,"ok, some demon movies shouldn't be made...or watched. a silly waste of time...and money.who knew? you do now.trust!"
2,so bad it's (almost) good,"If you crossed ""Gremlins"" with ""Last House on the Left"" and ""Night of the Living Dead,"" you'd probably come up with something like ""Demons,"" a grandly overblown horror farce which unfortunately has none of the virtues of those films. At random, people are picked for the premiere of a new film, but when the audience begins to turn into the title characters, the survivors can't escape the theater and are left to do battle with the drooling beasties. All of this is a lot more interesting than it really is, basically because director Lamberto Bava (who brought us the MST3K favorite ""Devil Fish"") is no Dario Argento. Most of the events are utterly unbelievable (a helicopter falls through the ceiling for no reason), the dubbing (and acting) is bad, and the soundtrack (featuring a wide range of has-been 80's metal bands) is laughable. ""Demons"" is no ""Deep Red,"" but might be a hoot if you view it with an open mind."
2,Awesomely gruesome but trashy.,Movie lacks direction & plot and attention is focused on these bloodthirsting freaks. Script is poor & dumb. Pop Rock Soundtrack is mindless and totally incohesive with the movie. But bravo for the visual transformation on these monsters.
3,Mindless fun,"At random, a bunch of people get invited to the premiere of ahorror film that nobody's ever heard of and everthing that happens in the filmhappens in the town. Just another EVIL DEAD rip-off with the typically trendy use of blood and guts used in just about every 80's horror film, despite that this film contains stacks of thrills which makes it fun to watch with a bunch of friends."
4,One hell of a ride!,"To say the least, I was totally rocked by this film! I loved the story about people being trapped in a movie theater as a demon is running around turning other members into demons. It's a hell of a claustrophobic thriller! Sure the film lacks some logic and sense in some parts, but its not enough to drive you away from enjoying the movie. Very stylish directing by Lamberto Bava and superb special effects! Gore junkies will not be disappointed. The head bangin' soundtrack is also great. One can't resist to get rocked as the hero is riding a motorcycle through the theater lopping heads off of demons with a sword while Accept's Fast as a Shark is blastin' in the background. A truely memorable scene! The ending is also superb! So don't hesitate to pick up this film; it's one hell of a ride! One of the best and most entertaining horror films to be imported from Italy!"
4,A good scare,"""Demons"" is very similar to ""Evil Dead"" in its sense of claustrophobia and impending dread, and makes for a fun Saturday-night guilty pleasure. Entirely enjoyable, and more frightening than I remember from seeing it in the theater."
5,Sweet Movie,Old horror movies never get old :) Baught these for my brother for his birthday and amozon was amazing with the payment address not interfearing with his mailing address. he got them no problem as predicted. hard to put a smile on his face but it did lol.
3,Should Have Divulged Region of BluRay,I have decided to keep the Region B (non playable in the states)Bluray because the Arrow releases are typically totally class. I made the decision to buy a region free bluray player. I will add to this when I see the quality.
4,That's Argento!,"I've seen most of Argento's films. And this one's the best! Great FX. Storyline was good and ahead of it's time. To any collector, you must own this!"
3,Potentially good remake,"I've never seen the film but it sounds like the plot would make a good remake just like the remake of Dawn or Day of the Dead. It would be cool if it could attempt to be scary rather than the old 80's type horror movies which were ok, but not scary."
3,Demons in a Theatre!!!,I received this as a Christmas present. I thought it was demons coming out of the screen to attack people rather than a woman turning into a demon at the theatre and killing people. It had some pretty good gore scenes. I'd probably recommend DEMONS!!!
3,"Kind of a let down, but still ok","It's about what you would expect from a 1980s European horror movie. The movie is dubbed, the acting is bad and there are continuity problems that are pretty funny. One scene, a girl has a pony tail and a second later she doesn't. There is another scene where a dead person has their eyes open and then the next time you see the person a moment later, the eyes have closed (not because they were supposed to, but an obvious blooper). The dub acting was so bad, whoever was talking for the black guy reminded me a lot of Robert Downey Jr.'s character on Tropic Thunder. Maybe it was him! The gore itself is not a splatter fest like the comment on the cover of the movie suggests. It is basically typical of what you would see on a zombie movie like Night of the Living Dead. Maybe it was shocking in its day, but it is very tame by today's standards. I'd say that the movie is overall ok, it is enjoyable and the demons look cool, but that is about as best as it gets."
4,"Silly, gory fun","I remember watching this movie years ago when I was in junior high. I loved it. I finally got a chance to own it on DVD so I jumped at the chance. It's still a fun film, although it makes very little sense. It seems to be more of a splattertoon rather than a straight up story. I will not get into details, but suffice it to say it is very entertaining, just don't go into it looking for a solid plot. There isn't one. Still, I recommend it to horror fans."
4,Theatre Of Blood (And Other Goo)...,"DEMONS is a classic of kill-or-be-killed / monsters-on-the loose cinema. Bava presents us w/ plenty of victims and the demonized hordes who love them! Both humans and demon-possessed creepers are slaughtered in huge numbers! Trapped in the METROPOL theatre, a group of patrons encounter the first wave of a demonic assault. Watch as the dwindling survivors unite in order to fend off the hideous, slime-drooling hell-spawn! DEMONS is definitely a product of the '80s, w/ it's goofy fashions and silly hairstyles, which makes the death scenes all the more rewarding and fun to watch! Recommended for all fans of slobbering excess (like me)..."
5,Reliving My Youth,"I must have seen this film originaly when i was about 7 and i loved, so when it was released on dvd i had to buy it. Upon watching it again it still had the same affect on me. The effects are no where near as good compared to todays films but compared to the films that were around at the time it was far superior. This is worth watching if you like old horrors and dont expect loads of special effects that you demand from new films"
4,Some old memories ...,"What can I say about this movie ??? I just love it !!! I mean, ok the acting is quite poor and the dialogue sounds like ""cliché"" but this movie is so cool !!! The movie atmosphere is really strange, something I can't explain. But something is sure, you like it or you don't like it, there's no in between. So if you have a chance to watch it don't hesitate, then you might choose to buy it or not ... If you're into movies like Scream, Urban legends or Blair Witch, don't buy this one, you'll be really disapointed ... But if you like 80's horror movies you won't regret your money. It's also funny to see the evolution of horror movies between the 80's and now ...."
3,Great campy horror!,"I first watched this movie as a teenager. I was excited to find it and watch it again. It still holds as a classic of campy horror. The special effects are brilliant, especially for the time in which it was made. There are lots of scenes that leave you completely grossed out from make up alone.Loads of fun!"
1,Simply awful.,"I have been a zombie fan my whole life. This flick caught my attention due to the numerous positive reviews. In my humble opinion it does not come close to the Romero films. It really is not worth buying. If you are intrigued by the reviews please rent it first. If it wasn't for Sergio Leone, I'd be ashamed to admit I'm Italian."
1,Argento's biggest mis-step to date(That I have seen),"True it can be fun on a boring night or day, but Demons has little else to offer. Like most other Argento films, Demons does have moments of uter brilliance(only this time they are very few and far in between). I'm guessing him and Lamberto Bava were trying to make a better Night of The Living Dead, they failed miserably. The only thing to recommend in Demons is the excessive gore fx(which aren't bad and there's plenty of them)and the truely awful acting. If that's your cup of tea this is your movie. Also, there is a very good hidden message about,""Do movies make people murder?"", but by the end you will probably forget all about it."
1,Crummy re-recordings,These aren't the recordings you remember and they just doesn't have the punch. Very weak.
2,The Greatest Hits of Sam & Dave,"Disappointing! This is an import, and at least some of the songs appear to be re-recordings, probably by Sam & Dave, of Sam and Dave classics. ""Hold on, I'm comin'"" doesn't sound like the original recording, but may have been recorded live in a lounge.I'm not saying it's bad, it's just not what I expected. The glowing reviews of the CD on the website (including the one talking about the 8 track tape in the Blues Brothers' car) are actually about ""The Best of Sam & Dave"", another CD entirely."
5,Amazing price!,"After searching the internet for days, this was the best priced product on the market and the quality is great! Thank you!"
3,very small and unimpressive,I KNOW THIS IS A TOY FOR PETS but I purchased this as a gift for a child because she wanted a skunk for some reason and it was easier to buy it online than to shop around in stores for something so specific. She loved it and since it is small it is very portable. I didn't find it very impressive for the price though.
1,Ms Pacman,"The game worked only one day, the screen was so scratched, until you could not see the game. After one use the game died"
5,Very helpful enzymes for kitty digestion,"My vet prescribed digestive enzymes for my 8-year-old cat Bert, who suffers from irritable bowel disease. We tried many different feline enzymes (and spent a lot of money on them) before finding one Bert would actually eat mixed in with his food. The white powder is completely odorless and apparently tasteless, and it is the only enzyme product I am able to get into him. It has helped him a great deal. He's slowly started gaining back some weight, and his digestive upset episodes are much less frequent. There are other quality cat enzymes available, but I highly recommend Dr. Goodpet Feline Enzymes if you are having trouble getting your taste-sensitive cat to eat his enzymes. I should also mention that all 3 of my cats will eat it in their food, a true testament to its being pallitable!"
1,Not For Us.,"I purchased this in hopes of curbing one of my cats' IBS issues. Unfortunately this product gave my cat a reaction; violent vomiting after eating it. In fact, my poor cat was trying to run away from himself while vomiting, he was so scared!I measured everything correctly and after mixing it in with his food is when he had the reaction. I won't be purchasing this again and I've since thrown it away. I now use Purina's FortiFlora and am very satisfied with the results.Just a quick note, they only give the measurement per cup of food, they don't give any sort of variation for smaller servings."
5,a must-have item for all kitty families,I buy it allll the time for my kitties. It is so helpful for their digestion i hope all cat people search google and read about the digestive enzymes.
2,not what I expected,I was looking for one particular song from this group. I have about 30 seconds of a song from around 1969 and I dont know the name of it. It wasnt on this cd.
1,Died within 3 mos. of use. (nicely right after I could return/do anything about it).,"I bought this for work to install a remote sensor in a weather tight AC remote box. With this device I also bought a PoE switch to match. Within 3 mos. of use, this splitter died. I ended up replacing both devices (splitter and switch) with a ""AIR802 POEPASS-02 Passive PoE Injector/Splitter with 5.5 mm x 2.5 mm DC Size Connector"" pair and dealing with the voltage drop with an adjustable AC/DC adapter within the range of my sensor device."
5,excellent compilation,"In this great mix of Howlin' Wolf's work his influence on rock is evident. Like most blues, it is basic and honest and completely likeable. Howlin wolf is one of my favorite blues musicans and i recommend this album as a good introduction to his work or simply, blues in general."
5,Awesome so far but still reading,"My husband is what some may call a baby Christian while I've grown up in a Christian household, church, and school. We have been reading through it together and have both been learning about Christianity, God, and our faith as we go through the text. I highly reccomend it as it is Biblically based but written from an objective perspective but in a very understandable and fundamental way."
2,Too Biased,"I am not a christian, and bought this book to learn more about the faith. Although this book does provide a basic outline of christian beliefs, the author lets his personal bias slip into his writing much too often. There are numerous passages where he says something to the effect of ""many christians believe this, but it doesnt make any sense"". So if you want a fair and unbiased book outlining christian beliefs, I would recomend that you look elsewhere."
1,Way too hip/glib/slangy For You,"I was looking for a nice overview to Christianity. I'd picked-up a dummy book on some other religious subdivision and it was rather good. But this book is dreadful.IF YOU ARE OVER THE AGE OF 23, and/or IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN A SIXTH GRADE EDUCATION you'll probably find this book insulting, and way, way too hip. There is a dreadful, hip-ish cliche in virtually every paragraph, every other sentence.The actual content seems rather slight, superficial. The author is apparently way too close to the subject to really give much of any kind of critical analysis.Luckily for me, I'd borrowed this book at the library. The language is so juvenile, so hip, that I cannot bear to read anymore. I'll be back at the library for someone else's more serious take on this subject.IF you think I'm being overly unfair, why not BORROW it from the library, and see.Shame on the Dummy people for putting out such a pathetic work as this."
1,Should Be Called Fundamentalist Christianity For Dummies,"Although this book does contain a great deal of useful information, it does not fairly or accurately portray the spectrum of Christian belief. Instead, it implies that all true Christians believe the Bible to be literally true and inerrant. It also takes the position that true Christianity is not compatible with a belief in evolution. These are just two examples of numerous statements or positions that many Christians will find troubling in this book."
1,"I thought the ""for dummies"" part was just a gimmick","Rather than being a well organized explanation of what Christianity is and of what Christians believe, this book is a rationalization of Christian faith that anyone with even rudimentary critical reading skills can dissect. The increasingly stupid analogies and pop-culture references combine to make the condescension unbearable. This book truly is for dummies."
1,Not any good...,"I could only read an hour and a half of this poorly written outline. Read, 'A Compact Guide To The Christian Life' by Karen Lee-Thorp. It's much better."
4,Good Overview,"I read Mr. Wagner's book ""Christian Prayer for Dummies"" and loved it, intentionally or not it gave a better overview of what it really means to be a Christian. Which is a personal relationship with God.I was hoping for a better continuation in this book, but it didn't really happen. Mr. Wagner does have a wit and a sense of humour. But this book is rather dry. The book is more about how Christianity works than anything to do with a personal relationship with God and all the good things that come from that ie. a revolution of character, peace of mind etc.This book is for those who are looking for a good overview of the ""technical"" aspects of Chritianity. How it came about, the split from Judaism, why the Bible is so important. And the differences between all the Christian denominations. If you want to know about a personal relationship with God please check out Christian Prayer for Dummies"
2,"Should be called ""Fundamentalist Christianity for Dummies""","Having been raised a christian, I was suprised by what I read in this book. Several times I asked myself ""you mean christians believe that?"" The author assumes that fundamentalism is mainstream christianity and occasionally throws in some information about Catholicism, Orthodox religions and non fundamentalist religions almost as an aside. Very one sided and disappointing. There must be something better out there."
2,PROTESTANT Christianity for Dummies,"As a ""born again"" Christian who is feeling convicted that perhaps western Christianity is not right for him, I found this book to be severely lacking in its treatment of Christian traditions apart from protestant Christianity. Also, the author does not do a good job being non-partisan... he clearly espouses fundamentalism- for better or for worse.I also agree that the pop-culture references were over the top... comparing Marty Mcfly to Martin Luther? Come on!I won't go so far as to say that the book was worthless, but I do feel that it was mislabeled, due to its emphasis on the western Church, specifically Protestantism."
1,Narrow Perspective of Christianity,"Not only does this book only give Rick Warren's fundamentalist perspective of Christianity. It bashes Orthodox and Catholic, sometimes even traditional protestant beliefs without providing any clarifications why they believe that. All you get is the author's belief that they are wrong."
1,"Very, very bad...","I must be 3/4 of the way thru watching this movie on video right now, and all I can think is ""Please lord, let her die. PLEASE LET HER DIE SO THIS HORRENDOUS FILM CAN BE OVER.""Enough said."
1,In a word - woeful !,An absolute waste of time- has stilted acting and dialogue to make you cringe! Some nice cinematography is wasted on this stinker.
3,"Interesting story, but....","This movie has a very interesting storyline, with a fatally sick woman searching for one last love before she passes on. She just happens to find that in an older (abt. 48) man, which seems believable that her attraction would go towards someone of this age, since her time is even more limited than his own.It is a believable story, but the medical condition described, leaves little for the audience to hope for. The end seems inevitable, which leaves the characters to only enjoy the here and now. Which seems to be the entire point of this film anyways.It is a good movie, with an emotional storyline... however written as not to tear at your every heart string... but to just hope that Charlotte will have one more day with Will."
2,Just dreadful,"Sappy, stupid unbelievable story, badly written, poorly acted, badly directed, just embarrassing. I have no idea why they bothered. Gives one the idea that actors will do anything for money. If this were not true, then neither of them would have come within l0 miles of this movie after reading the script. The whole thing is ridiculous. Now, you understand I am as much a sucker as the next person for a really good story, well told about a dying girl and the older guy who falls in love with her. It just ticks me off that they took a good story idea and made this piece of junk out of it."
1,"Most predictable, formulaic, pablum I've seen recently","And I love Richard Gere. After the first 10 minutes or so, I predicted every plot move well before it happened, even predicted the full plot almost down to the scene. So glad I only paid $3 for this puppie; but even that was a waste. That said, I loved the opening central park flyover with Diana Krall singing ""Let's Fall In Love."""
1,Not very good,"I would not recommend this movie to anyone. The characters are shallow and unlikeable, which makes them very hard to sympathize with. The movie tries to be a love story, but the actors don't have much chemistry and it is badly written."
2,A missed opportunity.,"This film wasn't as bad as I expected, but it was one of those frustrating experiences where you felt they could have done so much more with the material. It almost seemed like they decided midway through the production to go traditional and forget about doing anything different. The movie turned for me during a taxicab sequence midway in the film. They took the safe route between the Gere and Ryder characters instead of going for something with more bite. Perhaps that was their intention all along, but it seemed like they had the material in place during the first half for something different. A commentary track on the DVD might have shed some light on things, but they didn't include one. They didn't include any extras at all. Definitely another minus if you like those things."
3,"Not Awful, But.......","After reading various reviews, I was really expecting this movie to be simply horrendous -- as horrendous as, say, the remake of A Love Affair To Remember starring Warren Beatty. In fact, it wasn't awful. Just terribly predictable. The shots of New York City are exquisite. Richard Gere and Winona Ryder work well together on the screen (though I have to say I've never been a big fan of Ryder's). But this story of a doomed love affair just had such a been-there-done-that feel about it from beginning to end that one could only wonder why the filmmakers didn't opt for some surprise twist in the old chestnut.Still, if you have nothing else to do one chilly wintery afternoon or evening, I would say go ahead and pop this film into the vcr, pore a cup of hot apple cider and indulge. For romantics this movie can serve like an appetizer until the real meaty entree comes along.:-("
2,Melodramatic Autumn,"The chemistry between the two lovers is lacking; the man is old enough to be the woman's father, but that is not the stumbling block to the romance--the woman is terminally ill. This is what Autumn in New York is about. Well, the movie is just an unsuccessful melodrama. I found it creepy and ludicrous."
2,Where is the chemistry?,"This is one of those films where everything is perfect and it still doesn't matter. The film is visually beautiful and Gere and Ryder give polished performances. Only one problem, I really didn't care what happened to the characters. Gere's womanizing Will and Rider's Charlotte have no chemistry. This firework fizzled!"
4,I'd like to have a date with Charlotte.,"I hesitate to give 5 stars to this movie, but I wish to give 4 stars.The number of stars for this movie was only two and a half when I rent this video. Thus, I had not had expectation before watching it. Though, I watched this video without boredom till end mark appears.I feel now I'd like to watch this again."
1,Awful Movie,"This movie is the first time I ever wanted a refund from a movie ticket. The plot is thin, and there's no chemistry between the characters. You don't care what happens to them, since you feel no connection with anyone."
4,A decent follow-up.,"Capitalizing on the success of 1989's ""Cycles,"" the Doobies followed with this set. While ""Dangerous"" made the only real inroads on radio. There are enough worthwhile tracks here to justify this as a completion to your Doobies collection. It may take a couple of listens before you're fully into this one, but take the time, it's well worth it."
5,Blazing Comeback Effort,"When you compare the recordings/new songs done after the Eagles' comeback against that of the Doobies, it's hands down to the Doobs. With ""Cycles"", ""Sibling Rivalry"" and this one, they brought back their amazing rock 'n roll licks and vocals with fervor, updating their songs to fit the era, but maintaining the distinctive Doobies feel. This album continues their tradition of never recording any ""throwaway"" tunes...they're all really top-notch stuff...well-crafted and well-produced. Even the mildest of Doobies fans will appreciate ""Brotherhood"". Get it if ye ain't ba-now."
5,Required listening,If you like the Brothers and you don't have this then get it. Great road music. A must for your collection.
3,BROTHERLY LOVE ROLLS ON,"BROTHERHOOD is the Doobies second album post Michael McDonald, and recaptures much of the 70s style the band was known for.Original members Patrick Simmons and Tom Johnston lead the band on most of the upbeat rockers. SOMETHING SHE SAID, DANGEROUS and DIVIDED HIGHWAY are the most noteworthy of these, but my favorites are the two most innovative tracks: IS LOVE ENOUGH with its Stevie Wonderish feel and UNDER THE SPELL, a jazzy blues rocker.The Doobies have commendably weathered the changing personnel and changing musical styles. I've always enjoyed the band with the McDonald era being my personal preference. Still, BROTHERHOOD is a worthy addition to their catalogue."
3,Not my favorite Doobies album,Many of the tracks on this album seem more Stevie Ray Vaughn than Doobies. There are none of the ballads like South City Midnight Lady or Another Park and no dreamy rocking numbers like Tell Me What You Want and no blue grass infused numbers. Just driving rock. And definitely not MM crooning.
2,Could this be the most beautiful mistake?,"OK, so I'll be clear up front - if you love the track ""The most beautiful girl in the world"", you'll love this CD. Frankly I think that this is the most awful track that Prince has released for many years - and this CD is just packed full of remixes of the same awful tune. I have to admit that musically, some of the remixes are interesting but nonetheless make me grind my teeth because the original tune is still obviously there.Being the ""die-hard"" prince fan I am, of course I have a copy, but this is only for the sake of having it in my collection.Quite how it became so commercially successful I think says more of the general populous than of the musical genius that must have either been having a bad day, or was short of cash that month :("
3,pretty run of the mill,Prince did this back in 94 it seems just like yesterday really?anyway it was a lighthearted pop tune that came in different mixes some things worked some were so-so this is manily for folks who really dig the Man or like top 40 stuff.this is far from Prince at his best but it has a moment or two that is cool.this Genius is overdue to drop the heat i hope it comes soon?
1,A waste of money - DO NOT BUY,"who needs 7 remixes of the same song...and not a great one at that....if it were priced at about 5 bucks it may be worth it....but i know many people who thought this was an EP with other new material and felt totally ripped off.......avoid this and just buy The Gold Experience, if you already own that then keep shopping. Prince has plenty of other CD's"
3,The Beautiful Packaging,"This is a maxi single of Prince's hit ""The Most beautiful Girl in the World"". Included are 3 remixes, 3 instrumentals, and the original radio version. I still like the original the best and rarely listen to the remixes.What saves this Cd from a 1 star rating is the absolutely incredible packaging. There is a georgous butterfly boklet and a second more traditional booklet with high gloss photos of Prince and the NPG. The CD itself is emblazoned with a vibrant picture of the glyph shaped guitar. The utterly stunning packaging and the original version of the song make this CD a great addition to your collection."
4,It's OK.,"I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting when I bought this (as I am a Prince completist), but it's a pretty one note gathering of remixes and different versions of the song. I would suggest it for anyone who wants one of everything Prince has released, and probably no one else."
5,strong & original,"I'm probably biased because I am a Damien Rice fan, but Volcano has this undertone passion in it combined with the melancholic touch that characterizes Damien Rice. Strong & original, creeps under your skin."
1,don't buy this book. It can't work,"Bottom line, the method proposed in this book is nothing more than showing flashcards. Yes sure a baby's brain will memorize them. That's all. Babies may very well memorize dots on the flashcards and associate them with a number. But that does mean that they are understanding the more complex abstraction of the meaning of quantities a number represents. It's wishful thinking that babies are actually understanding the abstract concept of quantities let alone additions and multiplications! They are not. It is a good idea to start early in stimulating a babies brain, but I'd recommend more traditional methods, such as kids books with numbers and shapes, that are far more engaging and fun for both parents and kids, and more effective."
4,Great Idea,"I bought this along with Teach Your Baby to Read and I can't say whether or not it's working yet, but if nothing else you spend some time with your children. So much of the book is reprinted from Teach Your Baby to Read, and I haven't had much luck finding the cards they suggest to use. But the books are valuable in that they advocate a respect for the learning potential of young children and offer specific instructions on how to develop that potential."
5,Can this be real?,I bought this book to teach my granddaugher. She is 6 months old. I can't wait to get started and see if it works.
5,Baby Math,Another great title by Glenn Doman that helps parents to focus on their children. Helps parents think of their children in new ways and changes what is possible because it changes our assumptions about our children. Reading and using the techniques in the Doman books giveschildren a head start on learning to love learning.
5,One of the best books I've ever read!,"This book should be required reading in school, the historical perspective, info on nature, and Belts perspective on anthropology are priceless and disturbing.A cross between a travel book and biology class, under extreme conditions with 4 legged transportation. It makes me appreciate how difficult it was to travel, back in the day, in a tropical country.The author was working for a mining company and travelled extensively. Belt does an excellent job of describing what he experienced.Some things are little changed up to the present day, horses and mules are still pulling wagons with wooden wheels, now competing for room on the roads with modern 4x4's.Nicaragua has lost much of what Belt describes but is still a beautiful country. Read the book, then go visit before the population destroys the rest...."
4,"Amazing detail for those days, many things and comments applicable today.","Amazing detail for those days, many things and comments applicable today. Description of nature and perception of how locals live with it, is done in a nice and entertaining way. Max"
1,Look elsewhere for useful stock information,"Ted Warren's book lacks any useful detail for today's investor. He puts down the approaches of other succesful people's methods of investing while singing the praises of his own. On top of this, his book costs about four times as much as an average paperback investment book. Save your money for more useful books on investment."
1,Use it and Lose Money,Many reviewers have pointed out that this book is simple in it's concepts. They are right. It however misses many basic points of investing/trading. It recomends buying penny stocks. Not a good idea. It recomends buying stocks that have been going sideways for a number of years as this shows accumualtion. This can work some of the time but certainly not all of the time. I've seen many charts with sideways action that ultimately went down or bankrupt and subsequently stopped trading. Couple that with the advice to never sell and cut the loss when the trade doesn't work out and you have a recipe for disaster. It's clear why so many people that were taken in by Ken Robert's advertising for this book have lost money.
1,A Total Ripoff,"This book is garbage. It oversimplifies a complex subject. Don't waste your money on it. After reading it, I now realize why so many people have lost money using this system. I wish I had listened to the many reviewers who lost money using this system before I wasted seventy-five dollars on this book."
1,Another one for the Trash Heap,"This book was a complete waste of time and money. The ideas are unsound and very dangerous. As someone with considerable experience and success in the market place, this book to me represents some college professor's fantasy of how things are supposed to work in the marketplace. In reality, those grandiose theories seldom work out and big losses ensue. It's no wonder most authors and business teachers in the colleges and universities never make a dime in the markets. The accounts by other reviewers of unbridled success, like 11 out 12 trades ending with a profit or %200+ profits are the only thing that surpass this book in being pure fantasy."
1,Don't Get Taken by Ken Roberts,This book is part of a package deal that Ken Roberts sells through ad mail sent out all over the country. This book is a sham and so are all his courses connected with it. Don't believe for a second that either of them work because they don't. I followed the rules outlined in the courses and the book and lost a lot of money. I'm going to try and rectify my losses from here on out by reading books and taking courses from people who have actually made money in the markets for real and not by marketing second-rate books and courses.
1,Let my loss become your gain,"Do yourself a big favor and avoid this book at all costs. I have lost a fair amount of my capital using this book in spite of the current raging bull market. Ted's ""let it ride"" philosophy has cost me several thousand dollars and I suspect it has cost several others money also, judging by the reviews. I've learned the hard way- avoid this at all costs."
1,Bad information has never cost so much,"What is with the $75 price of this book? I've read much more clear and concise stock market books that cost a fraction of what this garbage costs. Even Magee's 600 page hardcover copy of ""Technical Analysis of Stock Trends""(which is a true stock market classic) doesn't cost this much. The author rambles on without really explaining anything in a manner that the reader can utilize to make money in the markets. Don't waste your $ on this book."
1,Too Vague to use in the Real World,"I found the author unclear and vague in the implementation of his techniques. So you spot a long-term sideways base. So what. That doesn't tell you when to put your money in that particular security. The stock or commodity you are considering could go sideways for a long, long time or worse, it could go down. For the $75 price tag of this book, the reader deserves much more precise instruction on the use of the techniques."
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK AT ALL COST!!,"Unfortunately, I did not heed the warnings from the other reviewers and purchased this book and subsequently lost 25% of my money in 1998.Upon further relfection, I realize that the material in this book is nonsense. I followed the ""methods"" in this book with a great deal of unfounded hope and faith. I definitely learned my lesson and am approaching the market in a more traditional approach.For all of you hopeful investors, remember this saying ""Inch by inch it is a sinch. Yard by yard it is hard."" In essence, don't bite off more than you can chew. Use a sound and tested systematic approach that will get you there in the long run. Remember the story of the tortis and hare.The bottom line is that not all things are worth what you pay for (ie. $75.00)."
3,3 stars for now. More or less to come?,"This book would be very difficult without the Ken Roberts course. In any case, I do believe Ted is right on with his thoughts on insiders manipulating the market.Now for a test for all those curious to follow.Using Ted and Ken's system, I made 3 buys which I feel are very strong about. HENL at 2 7/8 (Henley Healthcare), CQB, 4 1/4(Chiquita Brands), RGEN 4 3/8 ( Repligen Corp.)One added advantage I have is the insiders report on Management's own buying of their stocks. All of the above had quite a bit of accumilations."
4,The Method works well in times like these.....,"With the market ticking down and with the economy going in the same direction, this book provides great data and proves that you can get rich slow. Adopting this idea may seem difficult for some, since you are holding for the long term, but will make out in the end. Since this book was written back in the 60's, times have changed, but charts do not. The only difference is that you may sell in a year, instead of 3 to 5 with a 300 % return. Keep doing that for 20 years and you are GOLDEN!"
2,"Good for those with time to waste, and money to loose.","I have read, and used Ted Warrens approach, and found some of the strategies useful. If you do not have access to the Bulletin Board quotes, and an active chart subscription, dont read this, also if you donot have access to real time quotes and dont want to watch your securities on at least a day to day basis, you may miss the chance to make it big....overall if you are a risk taker the book is for you. @ 75.00 it is a steep price, go with O'neils books from IBD(investor Buisness Daily)"
1,Night of the Living Dead,"When people talk of great stock market operators of years past, certain names always come up, even if they were traders at the beginning of the century. Names like Jesse Livermore and Bernard Baruch. These were truly geniuses in the business of the markets. There's a reason one never mentions the name Ted Warren in reflecting on the markets. One reading of his book will tell you why. His principles are as unsound and dangerous as an any I have ever seen. The publishers must have been thinking that by resurrecting the deceased author's book after being out of print for some time that the greedy public would somehow feel grateful that these ""long-lost"" secrets could now be revealed once again. This book should have remained out of print with the original copy burned to ash because it is just one more book touting worthless advice in a sea already flooded with such books."
1,A real sleeper,"I ordered this book through the Ken Roberts Company and made an easy decision to send it back. To me, this book, like Mr. Robert's own TWMPMM course manual, was far too vague and simpistic about the actual trading methodology and detailed trade entry/ exit steps to really be useful. The accompanying cassette recording of Mr. Warren in a live seminar told the whole story. It almost put me to sleep."
5,The book holds true to its title!,"You must take time out to watch the stock market, but I think this would be true for any method. The book explains a method of identifying potentially great stocks and ways of avoiding failure. Of course those with finance degrees will probably hate it since this book could put them all out of jobs. This book could bring about the extinction of the broker. I have realized gains of 100 to 200% in one year. This book is highly recommended."
3,"Strong on buy, weak on sell.","The person who lost 25K makes a good point. Ted is silent on bears and heavy downers. His system is in need of some finishing touches. Stop Losses would do, as would other disciplined sell strategies. But Ted, by his silence, implicitly endorses buy and hold, the fundamentalist's folly, unless his distribution signal pops up before the bear comes knocking on the door. Ted can also put you in too soon on long bases and two or more years' action after a sharp drop. But unless I'm missing something, nothing much else is still in print re long-term chart rdg. Ted needs some fine tuning, but he has made me some money. Lost me some, too, while I was tuning and made me hop out, with lost fees, after buying on false signals from the patterns mentioned above. I still rely on him for part of my portfolio. Of course, you also must filter out his paranoia about manipulators. And the book is shamelessly overpriced. Glad I have the 66 work."
1,I lost money using this system,"I got this book in May of this year and started using Ted's formula in July. His method doesn't work at all in a down market. And on top of that, the stocks that his system led me to haven't recovered at all in spite of the fact that the S&P has recovered to a 17% gain for the year at the time of this writing. I'm sorry I ever heard the name Ted Warren."
4,Are you kidding me?,This is a positive review which must mean that I belong to the Warren Corp or Ken Roberts - nope on both parts. This book is excellent becuase it does teach a fact that most investors (speculators) miss. Even with all of your Web tools you still don't have the information and the market still discounts information. If you are a short-term trader or a momentum investor the advice in this book will screw you because by the time you invest - you have already lost. Trends may take a long time to announce themselves and then unexplainably one takes off. Why? read the book to understand - Manipulators and insiders. Don't believe? Think the small inevestor has overcome? Today you compete with other small investors with weak information and the generally upswinging bull market. Tomorrow you won't. The NASDAQ & AMEX scandals should make you stop and ponder...
1,Watch out for Ken Roberts claims. They might not be truthful,"After reading Ken Robert's brochure in the mail, beware of the hype posted in it. After perusing this book in my local library and realizing that it wasnt that incredible of a find, I now have to realize that Ken Roberts claim that this book is impossible to find is quite misleading. Not only did I find it for free in my library but here it is on Amazon. What a great country - advertise a book and say impossible to find when I found a multitude online. Do research on investing - just not Ted Warren's or especially Ken Roberts"
1,Don't Believe the Hype,"I am one of the people who read this ENTIRE book and can tell you from experience that IT DOESN'T WORK. Fortunately I played with a small amount of money over the last year to test Ted's system and suffered a %50 loss. It amazes me that some of the positive reviewers claim to have losses in some stocks but arrogantly claim that they'll come back. Only losers in the market game talk like that and if losers are endorsing this book or the people trying to sell it, then the book itself is a loser."
1,How to make the stock market take your money,"Take my advice , dont buy this book! I tried Ted Warren's techniques and lost.Whenever something sounds to good to be true, it probably is."
1,"In this case, the crowd is right","I have to admit that at first, I was a little surprised by the high number of negative reviews of this book. But after purchasing and reading this book, I believe the majority of reviewers got it right this time. I have been involved in the markets for many years and have had my own ups and downs(fortunately more ups than downs) and have read many well-known books along the way. I found this book to be redundant, unclear, and in many cases very dangerous in the approach that it takes to investing. There are much better sources to take from if you want to educate yourself in the stock market."
1,A Bad Analysis of Stock Market Action,"This book advocates the use of stock charts in making investment decisions-that's the good part. It didn't explain how to time the buys and the sells of the investments-that's the bad part. If your going to use charts in stock market decisions, you may be right a certain amount of the time, but your also going to make mistakes. Ted never explains how to handle situations when your wrong, which will inevitably happen(it happens to everybody including Warren Buffett). In fact, Ted believes you should let the loss ride until you are finally proven right(or broke). Overall, a poor investment philosophy."
1,"If at first you don't succeed, write a book!","This book offers no practical information for investing in today's markets. Using this so-called approach will send you to the poor house in a hurry in a bear market like the one we're having currently(July-Oct.'98). You might get lucky during a wild bull phase but if you don't identify when market conditions are changing you're going to be toast as one of the reviewers below me found out. Maybe Mr. Warren found this out the hard way and tried to make up for some of his losses by writing a ""how to"" book."
2,Not the best book on technical analysis,"Like it or not, Ted Warren's principles actually work, for how else could he - a mere uneducated laborer - invest his way to becoming a millionaire? Yet despite his success in stocks, Mr. Warren struggles to pass on his self-taught secrets to the reader. His chapters lack the focus on step-by-step instruction that a how-to book should have. Also, he does not provide any empirical evidence that his strategy actually works (which is a chronic shortcoming of technical analysis in general). Nevertheless, he urges the reader to adopt a long-term perspective, and his rags-to-riches story - though not skillfully written - is an inspiration."
2,A Widow's Walk,"You call it a Memoir, I call it a ""crying jag journal"". I was there, I lost a dear friend and a family friend. The firefighters, the policemen, the people working in the towers are all to be remembered. I'm surprised that this book even got published. Let's honor all the HEROES!!!!"
4,A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11,"This book kept my attention. It showed the events of 9/11 and it's aftermath on a very human level. We all know how we felt as members of our nation. A Widow's Walk explained what it was like for those who suffered more personal losses... the losses of husbands, fathers, sons, brothers, and entire battalions of firemen. Oddly enough, Maria Fontana is able to inject a bit of dark humor while trying to grasp, cope with, and explain all that has happened. A good read."
5,"A Must Read! Heartfelt, a Page Turner!","A Widow's Walk is one the best books I have read in a long time. You grieve for Dave Fontana, his wife and son. She is a skillfull, descriptive writer and sheds light on the undertones and politics of 9/11 that many of us have been too quick to forget. Her story is both a love story and a tragedy, her writing is comparable of Jodi Picoult. After you read this novel you will remember to hug your loved ones a little tighter...thank you, Dave, Marian and Aidan for sharing your lives with us. We can not thank Dave and all of the rescue workers of 9/11 with words, words can not begin to express our gratitude for their sacrifices."
3,Very Moving; Gets Bogged Down Toward the End,"I loved this book initially. I was widowed in 1997 at the age of 28, so getting through the first half was very hard for me emotionally, but also somewhat cathartic. Fontana does an excellent job of letting the reader in to her own personal nightmare that was shared with so many. I felt there was a little too much detail in the last quarter of the book, more information than I wanted on the organization she founded and all the meetings that took place, etc. The book is still a good read and I read it in about 3-4 days."
2,True Blood,"I bought true blood for a dollar at a video store in the mall as a joke. Considering I never heard of Jeff Fahey and Sherilynn Fenn I was pretty sure it was going to be pretty darn bad. However, the plot was entertaining and as 80s as it was it wasn't that bad a movie. If you want to watch a movie about a mixed up kid in a gang, his brother and the woman he loves then true blood is your kind of movie."
3,Sherilyn Fenn is the best thing in this video...,"Especially with short hair! Otherwise the plot is tolerable, although only just. Lukewarm performances from Fahey and Lowe, but the bald dude from Top Gun is in this and that makes for some fun dialogue. Overall, if you're looking for a decent movie, you might look elsewhere..."
4,Adorable MLP collection of stories,"This is a cute collection of MLP stories featuring the older MLP. If you're looking for the newer MLP such as Rarity, Twilight Sparkle etc. featured in the cartoon series showing on the Hub channel, they are not found in here. Instead, the ponies featured are the older MLP such as Minty, Cotton Candy, Butterscoth, though Pinkie Pie (the older version) is found here too.The stories themselves are positive, and the book contains eight stories in all. The first, ""Meet the Ponies"" is not really a story but a poem which introduces the ponies, followed by:Pinkie Pie's Spooky DreamA Pony's TaleFun at the FairPony PartyWishes Do Come True!Fashion FunButterfly HuntThe book is lavishly illustrated with full color illustrations that will have children exclaiming in delight. My six-year-old found this an easy read to be read independently, but it would also be perfect for sharing and reading aloud to younger children."
2,"Shallow, boring and superficial","I ordered this for my 3-year old daughter for Christmas but when it arrived, I couldn't bring myself to give it to her. Compared to the animated show, the stories here are very shallow and superficial. The stories are very ""girly"" and not in the positive sense of the word. The values here all seem to be about being pretty and having parties. I ended up giving the book away to a charity. In the future I will probably avoid ordering character-themed books and stick to classic kids books or some of the innovative and beautiful new books that aren't so gimmicky and superficial. I preferred Ladybug Girl for promoting a heroine that was brave, adventurous and imaginative, or some of the gender-neutral books out there."
5,Daughter loves it,My daughter's fav book! She keeps it in the car and reads it all the time! She's a MLP fanatic!
5,love it! not only the western kid,"bought this for kid, she love it as much as her mom! she is a story teller, one page a day, the first thing she do every morning! thank you."
4,Cute storybook collection.,"My 3 yr old suddenly discovered My Little Ponies, so I ordered this collection to save time and money. First, the shipment came VERY FAST (Thanks Amazon!); secondly, I think this has just enough stories(8) and names to satisfy my little one--and me. Very colorful and cute pictures with cute stories--though I still find it hard to believe in ponies in dresses and dancing ballet, etc., you get the point. Glad I bought this and have already recommended this to another mother of a 4 yr old who is getting into ponies but not yet old enough for Misty, or Black Beauty, etc."
4,Book-My little pony,Stories are short and sweet! Photos in the book are nice! Its has a lot of moons soo that made our daughters happy! When they see the moon they get sooo excited. Overall happy with the hard cover book
1,Repetitive non-spectacular footage of air acrobatics,"The film is very repetitious without any very inspiring shots. There also doesn't seem to be any strong theme to the movie that I can see. No dialog except for a small section towards the end involving the planning and execution of one of the air scenes. It was all in French with no subtitles and no alternate languages available.My 3-year old son sat through one 55 minute run of this $3 rental and refused to watch it any more. He loves the ""Super Speedway"" DVD and most movies with airplanes, but not this one. I'm thankful it was only a rental."
5,Scooby-Doo Dinosaur...,My son loves these level 1 books! He can read independently with help from the picture clue words. These books give him confidence and we buy everyone we can find.
5,Very Good,My son loves reading this book. It was one of the best books I've purchased in a long time.
4,Fab trucks for fab kids,"I bought this for my nephew, 6 years old. He and his buddies had a weekend play date and this was part of the day's entertainment.They absolutely loved it. While this works well for one child, the singing and spelling parts can easily serve as a focus for a small group of kids(boys).The excitement of seeing fire trucks and dirt trucks in action rolls over to the learning the alphabet and spelling - making it a fun exciting game that they can do together."
4,"A great tape,full of mystery!",Who will get the trip to Hawaii when Serena and Raye enter a wedding dress contest?Will Serena become a world-famous model in swimsuits?Will Mika forgive Sammy for breaking her doll?And will Molly fall for Nephlite's fake Tuxedo mask?All this and more is revealed in Mysterious Tuxedo Mask!
4,Try It! You'll Like It!,"It's very easy to get caught up in Sailor Moon because the characters are very likeable, and you'll want to see what happens when Serena and Raye try to enter a wedding dress sewing contest, or when Serena enters a modeling contest as much as seeing the Sailor Scouts defeat Nephlite's latest evil schemes. The characters' daily lives are as much a part of the show as the heroics are, and that makes you care about the outcome of the episodes more. There's also a couple of sweet episodes about how Sammy broke Mika's prize winning doll, and the beginning of the story of Molly's ill-fated crush on Nephlite (a.k.a. Maxfield Stanton). I would reccomend this tape (and Sailor Moon in general) to anyone who likes anime, that doesn't mind American dubs. Be forewarned, however: Sailor Moon can be a highly addictive series!"
1,Terrible!!! Can someone get me some subtitles?,"I'm really upset that ADV got the rights to the first two seasons of Sailor Moon. The dub is really bad, especially the voices. And the music is not the original, it is terrible new music. ..."
3,"Generally well-written, but incomplete and behind the times",This is generally a well-written narrative from publicly available sources. It does contain a few inaccuracies and misses the author's more recent works and activities.
4,Rocket Rocks!,"Don't write these ladies off just because they're a band of hot girls, and no, they are not clones of The Donna's. These ladies know what they're doing. ""Girls With Candy Hearts"" is the definition of infectious and insanely danceable. There's a retro feel that is reminiscent of The Pretenders and The Go-Go's. Stand out tracks are ""Not that Kind of Girl"" and ""Funtime"". ""Not that Kind..."" is not what you think, as this quote will tell you: ""All the boys know that I don't date, unless he's really hot."" It manages to make such superficiality ok with its bouncy chorus and ""Mickey"" style handclaps. The chanting hook of ""Hey baby, we like you lips. Hey baby, we like you're pants. All aboard for fun time"" opens ""Funtime"", a track that features references to ""Dracula and crew"" as ""we're havin' fun."" The song also boasts a bassy new wave beat that is very ""Money for Nothing"". All in all, this a great soundtrack for rocking out in the mirror, singing into a hairbrush."
3,good strings,"These are really good strings, they have a nice tone and great action. The only drawback is the outter wound part of the srings are just a little too short for my Ibanez acoustic electric bass. Each string's outer winding needed to be about 2 inches longer to reach the tuners of my bass. They work ok now but may develop a rattle or buzz after they age."
1,I never received these strings,"I purchased this set of strings on July 14, 2010 and never received them. I called the number on the invoice which led me to an automated machine where I believe I left my contact information, yet I was never contacted in return"
2,"Watch out, it's FullScreen","I can't believe it only in Full Screen! No widescreen version. I love the movie, but now that I have an HDTV...."
2,If you are a pilot.........,"If you like cool flying scenes, get this movie. Don't follow the storyline. Just fast forward to the cool flight scenes. The rest is pure dribble"
5,THE MOST AWESOME MOVIE EVER MADE,"This movie inspired me to pursue my life long dream of becoming president of the national Iron Eagle Fan Club. Twisted Sister did, in fact, play a very cool tune in the movie. Here is a little snippet. ""We're not gone uh take it. Oh we ain't gone uh take it. We're not gone uh take it anymoooooooooooore."" The dialogue is Shakespearean worthy and the Grandmaster would have a hard time creating this involving interaction between characters. If you want to see a very moving film that inspires everyone on the planet to become fighter pilots that are 17, rescue their dad from some OPEC country, then get down to that video store and be ready for a real treat."
4,Iron Eagle,"This is not a bad movie. It has many enjoyable sequences. However, it is not a movie to be taken seriously. The plot evolves around a highly motivated kid trying to save his father who is held captive in a hostile Middle Eastern country. The antics associated with devising the rescue are very sappy. A kid flying a highly sophisticated military fighter then taking on MIG's is not believable. However, the aerial dogfight flying sequences are well done. The 80's rock music is also very good. If you can look beyond the believability of the activity and into the ""teamwork & freedom"" storyline you will enjoy this movie. A great family action movie with patriotism! I am going to also buy the soundtrack."
4,Just Plane Fun,OK. It's NOT a documentary on the military (thank goodness). It's eye candy. It's ear candy. It's just a fun movie. It's one you'll want to add to your collection.
5,Old enough to rock&roll,"I search for the music title and name of the artist in the beginning of the movie, where Doug fight against the bike ! Where can i buy this title ? Please email me ! (Valdas@gmx.de)"
3,Only if you're into fighter jets!,"I really like some of the scenes in this film, i admit that the script, storyline and characters are bad, but the flying sequences are well done and the soundtrack is great! I think you have to be into air combat to appreciate this film, otherwise forget it."
3,The Soundtrack,"Maybe Iron Eagle is not one of the best movies but it is still a lot of fun. I especially liked the soundtrack which i own on CD. But 3 of the best songs were not included. These were ""Were not gonna take it"" from Twisted Sister, ""Eyes of the World"" from Eric Martin and ""old enough to rock & roll"" from Rainey Haynes. The first 2 were available on CD but the last one is a bit of a problem. My question: Is the song ""Old enogh to rock & roll"" from Rainey Haynes available on CD? I have searched the internet without succes. Is there anyone outthere who can help me? Please mail me!Greetings from Bart (BOOKELMANN1@ZONNET.NL)"
4,excellent,"The Fox is not typical of Lalo Schfirn's 1960s soundtracks. The score contains none of the perpulsive funk of Bullit or Dirty Harry.This is instead an orchestrial score. Based on variations on a few themes, Schfrin uses mainly strings, flutes and some electric harpsichord.The music is mostly sublte and delecate, although a few sections change the dynamics with large cresendos.The rusults are fine, but certianly don't grab you like his more funk oriented work. Still, if you like Schafrin's film music, this is a great way to find out about a different aspect of his composing."
2,This TIme of the Year,"""This Time of the Year"" didn't have a list of songs on the DVD. I was very disappointed in the selection. THe songs were silly & not Christmas oriented."
2,What a disappointment,"As a huge fan of Steve Tyrell's other two albums, I was hugely disappointed in this missed opportunity to apply the same gentle jazz/swing arrangements to a selection of holiday standards. Instead, the album offers over-blown arrangements and and no sign of Tyrell's trademark relaxed vocal phrasing. Too bad."
1,"No voice, no talent.","If Tyrell ever had a voice, it's gone now, as evidenced by his inability to sustain even the shortest notes or phrases. What passes for Steve's 'style' is a graveley, fall off at the end of every musical line - a sort of old school, pseudo-hypster, I'm-really-cool-at phrasing kind of thing. In the business it's called 'no pipes.'If it were not for this poser's music buisness connections, no self respecting label exec would have ever invested a nickel in this ego laced load of song assinations."
3,It's weird..,"I don't like the end, it's unexpect. The story was developed by the tip they found, more and more evidences made you comfused. But, Agatha is a great mystery writter, overall, ""Murder on the Orient Express"" is a much better book!"
3,"Great Writer, Poor Book","There's an old saying ""Even Homer nods"". Agatha Christie's nod was ""The Mystery of the Blue Train"".The plot manages to be both weak and overly complicated; it is 'fair play' but just barely. The characters are not up to Christie's usual standards, but they are not too bad. The pace of the story is awful -- not just slow, but aimless, and totally lacking in humor -- in a word 'flat'. My guess is Miss Christie had a good short story but had to produce a novel; and so she strung it out.I've read and re-read all Agatha Christie's novels and short stories, and in my opinion she is the best detective story writer ever. Sadly ""The Mystery of the Blue Train"" is not Christie at her best, or even at her good."
4,Wonderful Return to Form,"The Mystery of the Blue Train is not Agatha Christie's most famous or best train mystery, that would come a few years later, but it is a worthwhile addition to the Hercule Poirot series. It marks a return to the kind of mysteries Christie wrote best and away from the earlier spy thriller, The Big Four. This novel is full to bursting with interesting characters from secretaries to jewel thieves to countesses to companions for crusty old ladies, and all drawn with effortless skill by the author in a few simple strokes. There may even be a few too many characters for some reader's tastes as a few of them are quite obviously not actively involved in the plot but it is fun to watch the author parade the cast of characters all about the villas of the Riviera and the streets of Paris. A very nice Christie whodunit."
3,"It's definitely no ""Murder on the Orient Express""","Definitely not one of her best. I barely finished it because I lost interest. It's racist and outdated and not very suspenseful. And very little of it takes place on a train.For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal."
3,"Enjoyable, but easier to solve than most Poirot mysteries","""The Mystery of the Blue Train"" is a puzzle-type ""historical"" mystery. The mystery was clever, but enough clues were given that the reader can figure out whodunit. In fact, I felt like this mystery was more solvable than most Poirot mysteries: each new clue made the picture fall more into place for me and only one of the false clues threw me. However, some loose ends (created by clues meant to throw the reader off) were never explained.Some of the characters were complex, but we didn't get to know any of them very well. The details about the setting and time period were sketchy, as is typical of Agatha Christie. There was a very minor amount of bad language. There was no sex or gore. Overall, I'd recommend this enjoyable mystery to fans of Agatha Christie."
3,Very funny british comedy,"This is off the wall ramdom slapstick humor. You have to know when you're going into a Yahoo Serious comedy that you're going to get some really goofy stuff. Even the more subtle social satire that he loves to weave into his movies can go unoticed by some people, or get lost in the silly antics of the physical comedy. If you like british humor, this is a must see. I enjoyed it, but remember DON'T TAKE IT SERIOUSLY! If you do that, you will enjoy this hilarious movie!"
1,The worst Aussie film in years,"I honestly don't know why the person above found ""Mr. Accident"" so interesting. I went to see it with my friend, and we were hoping for some good Aussie humour and unpredictability.Unfortunatley, what we got was a b-grade, flatly-written, predictable, unfunny, and painfully boring movie, and we left the cinema feeling like we had been cheated from our money, and I have no doubt that the other people in the cinema felt pretty much the same because half of them left before the movie was over, and absolutley nobody laughed even once throughout the entire movie."
5,A good movie if you dont want to think,"this movie is supposed to be FUN not an oscar nominee. Make sure to keep in mind while watching it that yes it is over the top and ""out there"" but that is how its meant to be. The constumes are bright and the props and scenery pop out at you its a flashy funny movie and I think anyone with a sense of humor should give it a try."
5,Hilarious,"Well, young Ryan Abshire, sometimes the best humor goes on when you're thinking like a five year old. You must not like funny movies then, if you didn't enjoy Going Overboard.Yahoo Serious is a genius.""I hardboiled myself a six-pack and I'd like you to have it.""This movie is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. If you don't like it, I suggest you dip yourself in salt and launch yourself into a pit of male horses, and see if you find that humorous. If not, you might just be sane."
3,Not really sure yet,I have learned that with Yahoo Serious you need to be patient. Sometimes it takes a while to get the humor behind what he is doing as was the case with his last film Reckless Kelly. The first time I watched it I don't think I laughed more than once but over the next few years I watched it again and again (because I really liked his first movie Young Einstien) and it grew on me more and more. Now it is one of my favorite movies. Well with this one (Mr. Accident) I can't really say if I like it yet but the first and only time I watched it I only laughed a few times. Perhaps I should have waited to write this review. Maybe I can update it in two years...?
4,Could be better...,"I loved this CD, and it was well worth the price (Hey, I've never seen it cheaper) But in my opinion, it was missing something, perhaps if the company had added somemore songs? Anyways, WELL WORTH THE MONEY! I listen to it over and over (Bugs everyone ^_^) So, if your a hard-core digi-fan, get it."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this book hoping to get two things: a refresher on the Inventor program, and a quick reference while using the software. I found that this book was decent in giving me a refresher, but it wasn't very handy as a quick reference.Once I started using the software again, a lot of specific questions popped up. The Inventor Help is nearly useless, so I was really hoping for some clear step by step instructions. While these do exist in this book, the examples and pictures to support are not very clear."
5,So soft! Well made and washes well.,"I purchased this set for my granddaughter and am so happy I chose this. She absolutely loves the blanket that came with the set and calls it her ""softy covers"". I have washed this multiple times with great results and couldn't be more pleased. Great product."
4,Practice makes perfect,"Sometimes, you need to be handed a bat & have a dead horse placed before you in order to understand something fully. Reprise does just that for French grammar. Explanations are very clear, and the exercises isolate aspects of the language in a way few other books do. Although cultural notes are treated in an incidental way, they are, nonetheless, present. The grammatical aspects of the book are excellent, but it's probably not the way to go if you're looking for conversation, communication, and/or cultural competency."
4,Great supplement to self guided study,"Having studied French in college and visited France many times, I realized the need for a serious review of the language. Reprise provides plenty of practice and gives it meaning with the cultural background work. It is well worth the price, but the publisher should consider an answer key, which does not come with the book and is available only to people who can prove that they are educators. As a teacher, I could purchase one easily. Non- teachers won't have that option. With an answer key, I'd rate it five stars."
4,Keeps my key PC from suffering hard shutdowns,"At my house, during rain storms, there will often be a quick flash of the lights as a branch somewhere falls on the power lines. That type of event would always cause my PC to turn off, and I could loose quite a bit of work or even problems on the hard drive. This little device has keept that from happening for some time. I am very pleased. The battery that is in it does not keep the best ""time"" estimates for battery life, but knowing that the short spikes or loss of power will not cause me issues makes it worth the price."
3,not impressed,"Only the ability to soft shut down 1 PC. I only have 2 flat screen LCD's, modem, wireless etc etc but the battery only lasts for about 30 secs. Probably enough to protect against most outages\surges but still, its a bit weak. I did re-route the power to a battery that came out of a data centers UPS room. (120lb lump of lead, plastic and acid) things are much happier now."
3,directions are impossible to understand,"The product works fine, but the directions are stupidly complicated. We had to hire someone to help us install it, and we both have Masters degrees."
2,Short Life,I bought this thing because I lost a memory mod to a power surge. It worked fine at first but now it has no battery life. Recently the power went out and my computer shut off immediately - like it was not on a backup at all. Of course the alarm was still screaming but so what - my computer was already shut off without any warning. I had this thing for two years but I will be going with a different brand next time.
5,Great little UPS,"Easy to install and on my test the software/backup worked great. I pulled the plug and the computer/monitor didn't flicker at all. After the set amount of time, it put the computer into hibernation as expected.I did discover that having the UPS' USB connected through a 4-port USB hub prevented the computer from resuming from hiberation. No idea why, but once I moved the plug to a port on the computer itself, this stopped being a problem.I contacted APC about this problem and they were quick to respond with further questions to help diagnose it. While debugging for their mail, I solved the problem myself."
2,"FOOD, FOOD, and more FOOD","The far more sensible title for this dvd is ""Food Served on Trains"", because most of the video shows the sequential serving of various foods on various trains in various countries! I expected from the title that I will get a view of the places around the train routes as the journey continues, but totally disappointed. If you are a food lover, you might like this dvd ;-)"
5,Satisfaction top notch!!!!,"I can only say I will be a lifelong customer after using this product and experiencing customer service with this company! Long story short I have many marks & discolorations on my face due to several illnesses, so my skin tone is very hard to match and cover. I choose pale beige, turned out not my color. CM called me after I sent an email.After speaking with me and still not knowing my illness issues, the rep mixed colors to see if she could get a shade for me! I got a call back 1 hour later to tell me my shades were in the mail! Wow you don't get customer service like that anymore!Not even face to face at the store! THANK YOU so much CM! I have my perfect shade and coverage!"
4,Tanguy the rare jewel of surrealism,"It is with great dissapontment to realize that having the opportunity of achiving partial access to the work of this XX century master, is somehow a matter of luck, by chance I got hold of a copy, and although is recommendable and good starting point, is modest in bringing justice to the quality and outstanding conceptual and technical dimension of this artist. That is not Mr. Soby's fault, he did a good job, but a far more extensive volume is required. It is important for curators and publishers to bring this artist into the light, to promote it, even with purest commercial interest, this artist will deliver joy to any individual, and shall create demand for whoever publisher that treats his work with respect."
4,Shadow Skill OVA,"What more can I say? Megumi Hayashibara as the female lead and playing one of her super cool roles. The animation is very good and the fight scenes are very detailed and are somewhat bloody. What shines is the detail in drawing the characters especially their muscles and the sort. If you're looking for some good action, get this video."
4,"Well done, but with subtle differences","John Harrison's interpretation of Herbert's Dune was well done, with a visually spectacular display of special effects. The large use of computer generated animation allowed Harrison to produce scenes that before were only locked in the reader's imagination. Overall the series was fairly faithful to Herbert's work, but I felt there were several key character misinterpretations. For example, the Lady Jessica who was portrayed as an emotional character often losing physical control of herself, i.e. crying, was directly in opposition to her Bene Gesserit training. There were other flaws and additional dialogue that strayed from the novel, but Harrison has presented by far the most accurate screen portrayal of Herbert's Dune to date. I especially enjoyed his effort to bring Paul's visions to the screen, this being an important aspect of Herbert's novel and was severely lacking in Lynch's film. I recommend this film to any true Dune fan."
1,What Happened?,"First off I know that the 1984 version of the movie obviously couldn't do the book justice, but this DVD makes Paul Atriedes look like a whiny two year old. When I read Dune, Herbert made it clear that Paul was like an adult at an early age due to lack of kids his age around the palace on Caladan. So why is Paul kicking his feet up on tables on treating everyone like they're trash? This movie threw way to much crap in that needn't be there, where as the 1984 version left too much out. Still, Kyle Maclachlan makes a far better Paul Atreides, and although the 84' version leaves a bit out, get it instead. Really helps with pronunciation also."
1,Dune Review,"I liked the 1980's movie better. Sting was more intense as a villian. You could see the drive, desperations and motivations openly expressed in each character then. The sets were slightly out of place, low budget looking and gritty, as you might expect from a time and place far in the future on a desert world. This new movie in comparison was too clean and well-wardrobed. Too many pastels and soft acting. Being drawn into a movie or show is important to me. I want to feel like I am in their world, not mildly interested so that I see them as just actors playing a part from a script. This movie lacked an inner fire. I prefer my Dune memories of the 1980's movie and the first six books. Now the books are a very detailed, religous hard-scifi set well worth the purchase. I give the first six Dune books a 5 rating. The 1980's movie maybe a 3 or 4. But this movie I give a 1."
3,dune area code,Received the Dune series and Children of Dunethese are coded for the US!!!! And I am in Europe. Pretty stupid for this global marketplace.PLEASE indicate this VERY clearly
2,Cannot Improve Perfection,"I was very dissapointed in this revision of the perfect DUNE. The actors did not grab me as did the original movie, they seemed as if they were trying to hard, it didn't come across naturally. The special effects were very nice but, again the original had more depth, the actors were real. I understand that it is very difficult to improve the perfection of the original movie, nice try."
1,Renaisance festival or DUNE?,"It was painfully obvious that the screenwriter and the director had never read the original novel. For all the special effects they gave us they never were really able to give us a reason to hate the harkonnens, to like the atreides, or to fear the fremen (or the sardukar). The actors were awful, the costumes were hideous, and the music was mostly heisted from the David Lynch version. No one really felt any pain and suffering, it felt like one big gay renaisance festival, full of chipper little renaisance folk. Skip it, unless you like that kind of fruity crap."
4,A Better Renditioning...But Not All There,"Well, I must say, John Harrison did a damn fine job of revamping the great novel, but it wasn't exactly what I wanted. I was ashamed at some of the horrible costumes. (No person in their right mind would be afraid of the Sardaukar in Harrison's version...and the stillsuits didn't even look like they worked).The Baron was a much better one than Lynch's version. He wasn't just disgusting, he was someone you could hate so easily because of his character. The Emperor was much more powerful than the original, and very well cast. Princess Irulan was well cast as well, and her character was a bit more in the open than in the book.Now...some of the sets looked cheesy, but it was a TV mini-series. You can't expect a big-budget kind of set from a mini-series, less its directed by James Cameron. The score was quite similar to Toto's original score, but there are no problems there.And that's that."
2,Arakis ain't the middle east,"I rented this because I am such an avid fan of Dune, the book, and David Lynch's vision. I was not only disapointed, but rather angry at the attempt to simplify the Fremen's culture by suggesting that they were in fact nothing more than Arabs on Earth's african continent. They appeared to practice the muslim religion, wore Arab garb.... no still suits! Just traditional Arab dress. The acting was want, with the exception of the costuming the entire effort was a miss. They had a lot more time to address the scope of the book, but missed this opportunity and dumbed down a terrific story. Maybe they were playing to a more adolescent audience. Whatever I did'nt like it."
3,It was alright,"Overall, I wish we could cut and paste the two different versions of Dune thusfar. Alec Newman was a horrible choice for Paul Atreides. I could suggest a dozen names that would have been much better. He has too little character development as well. William Hurt as the Duke was really bad as well. At times he seems mechanically inclined and the way he says his lines make him seem constipated. Most of the costumes were very well done and the fighting was alright. Some of the sets were very realistic but overall, the deserts set really stunk. Still, I thought this was better than the 1984 installment of Dune. I still can't get over Alec Newman though!"
2,YAFDA...,"Yet Another Failed Dune Adaptation (YAFDA). Harrison's adaptation lacks the power of the book. I suspect part of the problem is that Frank Herbert's characters and dialog are bigger than life -- and it must be difficult for actors to make that fine balance between overplaying the part to point of sounding silly and grandiose (e.g. Ian McNeice), or underplaying the part and sounding wooden (e.g. William Hurt and Alec Newman). Harrison and Co. made a valiant effort all the same. They deserve 4 stars for the scenery, the costumes, and the special effects -- except they get a big goose egg in my book for giving all the spice addicted people GLOWING blue eyes! And what is that thing that Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam is wearing on her head?"
3,"Quality DVD, but movie is average","I hadn't seen the movie, so I decided to purchase the DVD. The DVD was quality and I enjoyed the xtras, but the movie was a bit odd, and I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would have been. It does hold truer to the novel, but certain aspects of the first run were better. If you a graphics fan, it is ok at best, but for just SCi-fi interest I am glad I saw it."
5,A time enduring clasic,"This is a classic epic and perhaps the best true to book version of the story Dune. The acting in the movie is top notch and the effects are just as well done. Though it was produced for TV viewing, it is worth the length of sitting and watching. Especially if followed by the sequel Children of Dune, which was equally true to the book."
4,Frank Herbert's DUNE,"This set of discs are accurate to only a certain extent to the story in the book written by Frank Herbert. Why writers and directors can't put together a movie that sticks exactly to this perfectly written story is beyond me. The story of DUNE is so intricately detailed and exciting as written, why do they think they have to stray from it's Sci-Fi perfection. Artistic license? If that's the case, I can do without it."
1,"whatever you do, don't watch this","This is a truely awful miniseries. I don't know where to start. the acting was flat. With the exception of the females in this movie, the acting was TERRIBLE. Whoever was in charge of casting did a bad job, especially with Paul and the Baron. Also, most of this movie was shot in a weird orange or blue light, and in sceens with the Harkonnens, the camara was tilted at a funny angle. Most of the four hours was dialog, or showing Paul having long and weird dreams. I did like the Fremen eyes, but besides that this movie was awful."
4,FINALLY!!,"They did it right this time, and used the right amount of time to tell the whole story. Now people can watch a REAL film adaptation of Frank Herbert's novel, the David Lynch version needs to be burned."
3,Only for those who read the book,"First let me say I am a Frank Herbert fan. I love the books and bought the DVD from amazon. After seeing the movie I must say, yes I would still buy the DVD but I was dissapointed by the fact that if I had not read tbe book, I would not understand what was happening. I was hoping the miniseries would introduce a lot of people to Frank Herbert, but alas I don't think it will make people go out and buy the books which are fabulous.I was also annoyed by the fact that John Harrison gave Princess Irulan a bigger part in the miniseries. While Julie Cox is a talented actress, heck he's put her in places SHE WAS NOT IN the book."
3,Good Sci-Fi,"This is a huge Sci Fi production and it is quite good too.Good points: it's long enough to be true to the book, with no glaring mistakes; costume design is excelent; set design and construction is excelent; the worms are VERY cool. The fat baron and the princess characters have character; this movie is almost too good for TV.Bad points: terrible casting; William Hurt disappears in the first fifth of the series; William Hurt does a bad acting job; bad acting jobs all around except fot the fat baron and the princess; you can distinguish the blue screen from the set in some scenes; this movie is not good enough to appear in theaters."
2,Lackluster DUNE has poor acting and direction,"I was hoping for an epic with compelling characters, special effects and script. Unfortunately this is a version that went bad from the beginning. Compare Alec Newman with Kyle MacLachlan in the scene with the pain box. Alec is barely registering any emotion while Kyle is barely able to hold it together. It's a great introduction in what is to come later. This is pretty much how the whole production feels. The acting is stiff (William Hurt is terrible as Duke Leido), direction is very slowly paced, cheap special effects.Even the music in Lynch's version has a driving theme that's swirls into the passion of the attack with the Freman atop the worms. Fantastic.Lynch's version is far from perfect and I definitely prefer the version without the narration. Sci-Fi channel - please do better next time."
2,I believe they gave their best but...,"...this DVD proves it's really impossible to put all the complexity of Dune on screen. Just watching it you will never know how powerful Jessica is. Where is Tuffir Hawat? -- that guy isn't he. Many important details were cut out, such as the secret Bene Gesserit message Lady Fenring left for Jessica. And so on. The special effects are poor; take a look at the Maud'dib rat of the desert -- they took it from the Muppets Show!Please don't give up reading the book because of the bad impression the DVD might give you."
2,"Good Effects, Bad acting.","While this movie has good effects, the acting is *terrible*. In the beginning the series follows the book closely, but towards the middle-end it starts to rush through the storyline. And some of the characters are not well represented. That said, if you haven't read the book, or books, you might enjoy the movie. But if you're a die hard sci-fi fan, I stronly recommend you read the book, which is philosophically superior."
4,For Dune Fantaics,"This mini-series now on DVD is fun and well done, and is ideal for Frank Herbert fans. It goes into enough detail to satisfy you, while still moving at a pace that keeps you informed and gripped.It is to be understood that this was made for the Sci-Fi Channel, so it does not fly as high as Hollywood standards, but for TV it is totally entertaining.If you are a fan of the books you will like this."
4,Great miniseries,"Let's be clear. This is not the movie ! Hence, the special effects are less. To me that was not a problem though. It's a great miniseries. The only thing I really didn't like were the over the top costums: to big, to much.And what about the 'Director's cut'. Well it's actually the same as the dvd version you could buy in The Netherlands, but there is one big advantage. This US version has a very interesting commentary track and a lot of specials that inform you about the production. The special about the translites is the most interesting. And what is also important, the picture quality of this US version is much better than the Dutch or European versions. So everyone in Europe. If you have a region free dvd-player: buy this version !"
5,Dune,"This DVD arrived very quickly and in good condition.I enjoyed watching it. I am a great fan of David Lynch's film version of Dune, so I was prepared to be disappointed. I wasn't; the miniseries follows the books more closely and has a very good cast."
3,"A good miniseries, better than Lynch's.","THe rating is actually a 3.5 stars.Good Miniseries, though the costumes were bad. They looked horrific, especially the Harkonnen. And Irulan's dress has butterflies on them???!!!!The visual effects are good, except for some scenes, they looked like a videogame. The Sandworms are nicely done.This miniseries matches to the book very well. Many of the parts from the book were included.The acting was bad, though. William Hurt and Alec's acting were too wooden. SOme actors did well, like Jessica Atreides.Overall, this miniseries was no too bad, they just needed better costumes, visual effects, and they also need to act in a actual desert.Good miniseries, though, and better than Lynch's."
3,Good Movie,"Please avoid the review by scottah. This person does not what he is talking about. I have read the Dune series and seen both the David Lynch movie and the sci-fi mini-series. The sci-fi mini-series is very very good! Neither movie fully represents the book. Both leave out alot of detail. The Lynch movie is God awful. If scottah thinks that's better, then he should explain why Lynch has it raining at the end of the movie! Major major mistake.The Irulan character was quite good and the character development was quite obvious as you watched the movie, i.e. you understood why they spent time on her.I am disappointed that they left out the character Count Fenring - becuase it cuts to the heart of one of the story lines, the breeding program. But overall the mini-series did a good job of telling the Dune story."
4,An interesting miniseries,"I liked this adaptation of Dune, I thought it was many times better then the original adaptation (The original just wasn't long enough to show everything). It can be long and boring at some parts, and many scenes are shortened, down sized, or taken out, but it is still a good story. Don't watch it all at once either. I'll admit I hadn't read Dune when I saw this mini series, but this movie hooked me. I highly recommend this movie but don't expect everything you saw in the book."
2,Just not as good,"Although the plot is a little easier to follow in this version, I remain a diehard fan of the original adaptation of Dune...the casting was much better in the original (this Paul Atreides was not believable to me at all), and so was the set. Yes, the Lynch version has its problems, but it still has a better overall feel than this adaptation, which disappointed me greatly."
2,a movie on the cheap?,"All i can say is that I am glad I rented this DVD before I bought it! The acting is wooden and the effects are cheap. the set painting is truly terrible, often with a complete lack of perspective.A shame, it is a complete hash of a great story."
1,Far less interesting than the original,"My hopes were extremely high for this adaptation, as I am a fan of the books and of the 1984 film version, and I was very, very disappointed. The acting is terrible... Duke Leto has no personality, Paul is a whiny baby during the first couple of hours, and the supporting cast has nobody even remotely interesting. They managed to use nearly the same dialogue as the 1984 version, and add in long periods of looking at the desert, apparently to kill time.The producers of this fiasco would have been better served to have tried to do a sequel to the 1984 version, than rather to copy it using worse actors and worse effects. The Dune series of books deserves far better treatment than this. My advice is to get the 1984 version and read the entire series in paperback!"
1,Battlefield Dune,"OK, the title for this review isn't fair. I shouldn't insult Battlefield Earth like that. While they got a few things right - the look of the Navigator, the initial sandworm sequence - this series is a plodding, soul-less mess. Why is this book so hard to adapt? They had SIX HOURS to tell the story. Why did they leave so much out and add so much that had nothing to do with anything? Why did they make Paul so whiny and annoying? Why did William Hurt stumble around like he was on tranquilizers? Why were the Fremen running around outside during the day without stillsuits (Paul and Chani have a PICNIC outside without suits on!)? How the Fremen remain masters of stealth with eyes that glow in the dark? Why did the Baron have to rhyme his last line before every commercial break? Why did Feyd have a glowing white tortilla sticking out of his back? And just who is responsible for all those goofy hats? I could go on, but why bother. Don't even rent this one. Just read the book."
1,Speechless....nearly.,"Never have I seen such absolute garbage. This so called movie disgraces the Dune books and is an extremely inferior version compared to David Lynch's masterpiece. I spit on this abomination of a ""Mini-Series"". AAARRRRGH!"
1,Gawd-awful,"Where do I begin, there was so much wrong with it! The costumes!! What on earth were they thinking? And to have the baron all clean as he was, did the director of this thing even read the books? The settings were wrong entirely! The clothing was wrong! The ages of the characters even were wrong. The entire thing was wrong and I am glad to be rid of my copy."
2,falling short,"Having recently seen the Lynch movie and having reread the books after some years, I looked forward to this series as the film tried valliantly but fell short. I hoped with modern digital effects and a longer play time maybe this could be better.Sadly NO while the sets and backdrops are very good indeed and capture the feeling of the books very well 8 out of 10 that's were it ends.The script is hopeless I don't expect verbatum from the novels but some point of contact would be appreciated 1 out of 10.Now to the acting Hurt very good, but for the rest third rate would be complementary. But what really saddens is the portrayl of Muad'Dib as a spoilt tempremental American teenager with no self controll the opposite of what he is supposed to be I gave up on the DVD after struggling for an hour and will not be going back."
2,What the...<naughty expletives>?!,"I have read the entire series including the prequals by Brian. I came to Dune kind of backwards, I played the computer game, then saw the Lynch version, and then read the books, so bear with me. I greatly disliked the set and costume design of this production. The Bene Gesserit are above all practical, hats with ""wings"" are not practical. Many of the scenes in this miniseries seem rushed and lacked impact. I would not recomend this miniseries to anyone who's first exposure to Dune was the Lynch production, you will be dissapointed."
3,"An entertaining movie, could have been better","Not bad, but you could tell they added some Hollywoodish type stuff to make it more interesting for people who haven't read the book. i.e. when hunter-seeking tries to kill him, the Freman girl Chani was in his room supposedly to make his bed. Yeah right, they wanted to make Paul notice the girl, how Hollywood. Include the love scenes into this category also. The other Dune movie does a better job expressing the characters thoughts. Also, in this movie, Paul always seems angry. Overall this one is a bit closer to the book, but the first one is still good considering when it was made 1984."
4,Not Bad,"Have to take it for what it is, a pretty good attemp at a very complex story.....Don't pick it apart and you will enjoy it much better....after all it is NOT the book."
3,a wonderful addition to the Dune universe,"The Sci-Fi Channel's adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune is a great addtion to the classic Dune universe. This is not a remake of the David Lynch version, however a more complete telling of the story. As much as I liked the screenplay, I felt this could have been put to stage without the sets, backdrops and special effects. I loved this film, however I liked the imagry of the David Lynch version. Maybe one day they will find a way to merge the two films. A great film, and a great buy."
3,Big freakin worms,"If you're a Dune fan and saw that Hollywood version from a few years/decades back and hated that one, you might this series more palatable.Dune is something of an acquired taste and this does a pretty decent job of conveying the story well."
4,Sci-fi Epic finally given its due,"At last, Frank Herbert's epic tale has been given the scope it deserves. Avoiding any attempt to pay homage to David Lynch's overly-maligned, but dark and closter phobic, effort, this version is rich in colorful imagery and drama. Of particular note is the costume and set design, which gives this tale its enormous visual strength. Influenced heavily by the fashions and architecture of Renaissance Italy and ancient Middle Eastern civilizations, this version is a feast for the eyes. Though there are some needless expansions of Herbert's original story, they cannot diminish the power of this epic. It's a pity it's a TV version, because something this big can only be appreciated on the Big Screen."
5,A great science fiction epic!,"This is a truly great miniseries. While it differs from the novel in more than a couple places, it captures the feel and spirit of the original DUNE novel flawlessly. The special effects were great (for television movies), the acting perfect, and above all one of the greatest sci-fi stories ever written."
4,A glaring omission of a talented actor,"An earlier review failed to mention the memorable performance of Ian McNeice in the role of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. The thespian really threw himself into the ""weighty"" part. Every scene in which he is featured is a joy."
5,good adaptation,"I love the books, and I believe that this series is very well done and has a very good resemblance with the original story"
1,Utter trash,"The only things worse than the acting were the laughable costumes. Special effects are pathetic. If you're really curious, rent it. I can't imagine anyone wanting to actually buy this. Garbage."
5,Great Movie!,"It was a Great movie! I don't care what the people say. The Effects were great. The actting was great. The Whole thing was great. No doubt about it. MUCH better then the original Movie. If you want a good movie, get it. It is wonderful!"
1,Regrets !,I really wish that I had never ordered this product because 1. I got caught for an additional 22.20 import VAT and Clearance Fee and 2.It has the wrong Area Code so that I can't even watch something that I had really been looking forward to. You can imagine can't you that I really am pissed off and would only recomend this product to someone I really disliked. David Dubrow please note !
1,Poor,"In brief: hokey dialogue, poorly conveyed characters, disappointing! Some of the effects were pretty good, many important details neglected. You never really feel for the characters or their plight.If you have seen the Lynch movie, or actually read the books, don't watch this. You'll be terribly disappointed."
1,poor packed contents,"Received the package, in good outside wrapping. Upon opening it, found the first disk not locked, and was severely scratched to the point that this disk will stop for over 4 times in the playing of it.Very poor packing and poor service from this source. Will NEVER order again from this supply as little regard was given to the contents before shipping.Keeping the order, as this movie is hard to find on the market."
3,Better than the 1984 movie! Thank God,"This miniseries was more faithful to the book than the original movie in several respects (mainly because it's 3-4 hours longer). The characters are portrayed a little bit better in this version than the previous also, in the original movie Sting just didn't do it for me. One big drawback in this version is the blue screens. Whenever anyone is walking on a dune you can tell there's only about 3-5 feet of sand and the rest is just a screen. The blue eyes are always very fake looking. Both of these do seem to have been fixed in the Children of Dune miniseries though. Overall I enjoyed this movie a lot."
2,A Weak Version...,"After having seen the original movie with Kyle Maclachlan, I have to say I was sorely disappointed with this remake. Given a longer screening time, I would have thought the characters and storyline could have been fleshed out a lot more. It may have also been due to the weak and unconvincing acting, together with the fake-looking backdrops and amateurish special effects, that made me think I'd wasted my money on this DVD."
1,Just plan bad,"This was one of the worst attempts at adapting a Science Fiction Novel. David Lynch may have not been perfect, but his attempt was far superior. Dune is a tuff book to present, but this mini series misses most of the fundamental themes and the casting is horrible. Read the book and you will agree."
2,As dry as the desert this is set in.,"This movie takes place on a dry desert of a planet, where the new ruling family must prompt the flow of a mystery ""spice"". Unbeknownst to the new family, the Evil Emperor is awaiting with a huge plot to destroy them once they have accomplished the flow of spice. After that, it's kind of endless. There are battles, desert worms, fierce fighting and strange beings, and the special effects are fabulous. One young boy sees visions in which he is the Messiah of the freaky desert people, come to save their tribe from extinction. I never did figure out if, in the end, he actually fills that role. William Hurt is the new leader, temporarily. He plays a good and solid part, while whoever plays his wife is a bit daft. Star Wars like vehicles traverse the air over the unrelenting dustiness of the desert, but it isn't time for Darth Vader to move over just yet. Dune is dry, it is long, only mildly interesting, and not worth the money."
4,Why this is better than the 1984 movie.,"What can I say? It's all already been said, but I just wish to reinforce that this miniseries follows the book MUCH more closely, has a much better developed storyline, and is just generally better.When viewing the original movie for the first time, it's a big disappointment if you've just read the book, and makes no sense if you haven't read the book.The miniseries delivers the story very well for anyone, even those who have never before read any of Herbert's material.Good show!"
1,What about the story?,"I'll make this short. This version of the Dune saga is touted as a more accurate rendition of Herberts vision. It is not. How can it be more accurate when they significantly change the plot? Any cinematic version of this story should be dark at times. The Harkonens are sadistic monsters. They should be portrayed as such. How can Paul's ""son"" be killed? He did not have a son; he had twins - a boy and a girl. His son goes on to be emperor of the universe for the next 10,000 years. Tough to do if you're dead."
1,"Don't be deceived by the ""Yuehs"" out there! Lynch is better!","This movie in no way compares to the original Film. While it is one thing to tell verbatim the story in several hours(And quite dryly I might add), it is the true artist that can tell such a sweeping scope in just a two hour movie and still keep the ambience that the book had. Everytime I watch the original movie, I still get a shiver down my spine when Aliah says,""he IS the kwisatch haderratz!"" At the end of this new weak mini-series, I just yawned, rolled over, and farted."
1,Ruining a classic,"Though this version of Dune was more towards the book in many ways, it lacked in certain areas that the early movie version had contained. Mainly, the characters and actors in the original were much more satisfying than this version."
4,Dune: The Real Book Adaption,This mini-series does justice to the novel in this one. I'd say between the movie and the series; the later is better. The new version explained that the two fighting houses were mining spice. Spice is what makes the universe whole. Like heating fuel is to us. It runs the starships and gives the society an industry it depends on.In the film there was too much territory covered in too short a period. The characters were too rapidly introduced. The new version gives us a glimpse of what inspired the Star Wars myths. I know this novel was written at time when science fiction was seen as low brow literature. Herbert has proven them wrong. I'd like to see all the books adapted for telivison. If a little drama and additional writing is needed; so be it. Long live Dune.
4,Listen up...,"This was an excellent adaptation of the book. Sure there were a few discrepencies between the two but it is still much better than the David Lynch versio, (which even he did not like). Certainly Paul might seem a bit whiny, but in the book he was only 14 or 15, and he was being forced with a major relocation, and he whined, like he did in the book. Certain scenes were added and other removed, but this is done with all movies, it has to. You can't get 800 pages of writing into six hours of tv and still make it coherent. I recommend reading the book, and seeing this miniseries. Then make your own decision."
1,How come anybody liked this?,"I really am mystified as to why there are so many good reviews for this depressingly poor mini-series.I will not get into details, let me just say that the directing is awful, the acting terrible and the fx sophomoric.I had high hopes for this, as I thought a mini series was the only way to do such a masterpiece any justice. God was I wrong...After watching only about twenty minutes I was so depressed I actually turned it off. My first impression was Batman of the 60's. Yes, it does have tilted cameras and garish costumes.Suffice it to say that, flawed as it is, Lynch's movie is a much, much better adaptation than this film-school project on steroids."
1,It's terrible!,"You just look at Paul, his mother and the reverend mother Gaius Helen. The actors say proper words, do proper moving etc, but they're not what they trying to pretend to be. Would you believe that this pimply guy is Muad'dib? Well, maybe you would. But not I :) Look at Kurosava's ""Seven samurai"" to see how what real actors should be. Duke Leto and old baron in this movie weren't that bad, but I couldn't watch it to the end, it was too much to ask of me."
1,Disappointing,Forget about this version: too many bad actors and too bad direction of actors. Not to mention the absolute horrible costume design. And was there *ANY* art direction on this thing?Just go and get Lynch's version.
2,"Visually arresting but slow, slow, slow","I really tried to like this. I had read the Dune books years ago and really wanted to get immersed in a wide-ranging epic movie. But this is just boring and slow. It moves along at a glacial pace and the actor that plays Paul has utterly no charisma - he just seems uninteresting. Even William Hurt, who undeniably is an outstanding actor, seems wooden and uninspired. On the plus side, as other reviewers have noted, the special effects are generally good and the sets, particularly the banquet scenes, are magnificent and colorful."
2,COSTUMES AND ACTING RUINED IT!,"I'm one of the few people who cannot bash David Lynch's dark and dramatic film, especially the 190 version of that monumental film. I did get excited when I heard that the Sci-Fi Channel was doing a new miniseries based on the Frank Herbert novel. I could only sit through the first three hours before I decided not to watch any more. I always thought of Herbert's novel as dark, but this miniseries is anything but. It has some great visual effects and some fine fight sequences. But this version's gripping story of murder, revenge, love, religion and political intrigue is lost in a mishmash of horrifying costumes, lousy set designs, bright scenery and horrible acting. The only good performance in the film is that of the planet Arrakis, or Dune. Watch the David Lynch film instead of this horrible waste of time and energy. At least Lynch's film has character ""oomph"" thanks to a fine cast (Unlike this piece of ...). Grade: D-"
3,"The ""modern"" Dune","I remember being so excited to see William Hurt's version of the original Dune. After buying the DVD and watching the movie a few times (as well as reviewing segments of the film over and over) I began to notice myself getting more and more critical of too many little things--not the sign of a well-made movie. In short, except for the desert scenes (where they have a very obvious wallpaper background), the movie's special effects and props are quite impressive! Unfortunately, most of the characters' acting is WAY below the standard set by Dino de Laurentiis in his Dune version (which by the way I HIGHLY reccommend for all Dune reader fans). Costumes are fairly elaborate, yet overdone. A few important themes in Herbert's book that I realized in neither his book nor the first film was clarified in this one. Overall, worth seeing--but DON'T BUY unless you're a big-time Dune fan. And what is up with those RIDICULOUS British accents!!!"
2,Lacking,"Being a big fan of Dune I was eager to see the series. I was however very dissapointed with the style, effects and especially the acting. The second rate actors made it very hard to get into the story beneath. Although it followed much more closely to the details from the book I found it inferior to its predicesor."
2,not engaging,"you know i watched a little bit of this on SCIFI the other day and was quite unimpressed. yes the costuming was impressive, but man, it was just not engaging. i didn't care for what the characters had to say. Duke Leto did not look like a duke at all, hunched over and speaking softly. terrible casting in this film. Paul Attreides looked like he was always in a sour mood. i must say that i did wish that the older version had more of the political games found in the book, but i find it a far better version of the story as it engages you in the world Frank Herbert created for us."
5,"Part 1 is fantastic, Part 2 is very good, Part 3 is superb.","Part 1-The highly anticipated Dune miniseries gets off to a brilliant beginning. The set-up of the plot is absolutely wonderful. Already, the movie establishes itself firmly, thanks to some convincing acting and great visuals.Part 2-The second part of the miniseries is just as engrossing as the first segment, but suffers a bit from the weak-looking desert backdrops. Still, the desert sietches (the Fremen towns) are great designs and Paul's rise to Fremen supremacy is totally compelling.Part 3-Almost reaches the same wonderful heights of Part 1. This is the action-packed segment of the miniseries, and it's a good payoff from the great set-up."
5,The best.,"Yes, this is one of the best novel to movie adaptations I've ever seen. Having just recently gotten this miniseries on DVD, I'm impressed by the whole thing. Shot on widescreen, the film has the feel of a theatrical release. The awesome special effects also enhance the viewing effect."
2,How could they have gotten it SO WRONG,"The book was about the characters. This mini-series didn't give any insight into the characters as Frank Herbert wrote them...What character development there was, was completely wrong. If you read and loved the book, don't bother with this, it will bore you to tears. At least the movie version was fun to watch."
2,Review of SciFi Channel 25th Anniversary Edition Mini-Series,"Call me a ""classicist"". I enjoyed the original movie, based on the original Herbert book, much more than the mini-series produced by SciFi Channel. The SciFi Channel's version is based on the 25th Anniversary rewrite of Dune. Does William Hurt seem to sleep-walk through the first part? I couldn't think of a less exciting portrayal of Duke Leto. And he is given top billing? Like the 25th anniversary book, this film version lacks the character development and intensity of the original. There is, in my opinion, over-emphasis on the Fremen adoration of Paul, and little time to character development; the characters of Thufir, Gurney, Duncan, Pieter hardly seem to exist."
4,Nicely Done,While this version is still a bit campy like the original Dune movie it also covers more of the material (due to its length). If you're a fan of the story it might be worth your time to give it a watch.
4,Good Sci Fi,"I like this movie. Sticks to the book pretty much. One thing that I noticed that they left out was the name that Paul chose. Sure the movie only kept Muad d'ib, but in the book he's known as Usul and Paul Muad d'ib. Other than that, I hardly noticed things wrong."
4,Better Version by Far!,"There is no question that this version of Dune is far better than David Lynch's attempt in 1984. This version gave a more accurate presentation of the story and what truly drove Paul to do what he had to do. I only hope that if Mr. Lynch wants to improve his adaptaion that he takes both versions of his Dune and use this newer verion as model to re-edit his and maybe release a better one, but only maybe."
2,mediocre all the way,"weak actors, unbalanced storytelling (sluggish start, hasty second half, abrupt ending)...prove once again: Dune cannot be filmed"
5,"Finally, ""DUNE"" for the rest of us !!!!!!!!!","Everyone seems so critical of ""Dune"". This mini-series does this sci-fi epic justice for two major reasons.First, the DVD is brillantly produced at a very economical value. The colors and sets are very imaginative and the key to this production of ""Dune"". The DVD extras are your gateway to Frank Herbert's world of ""Dune"". You must watch ""The Cinematographic Ideation of Frank Herbert's, Dune"" first. This becomes your introduction and tutorial of this complex world. Now you can understand & enjoy this bold production of this sci-fi epic.Second, the cast was perfectly placed & the acting was very impressive. These international stars allows us to enjoy & digest the real story / plot of ""DUNE"".So buy it, digest it and enter this fantastic color / emotional world Frank Herbert wanted us to experience, ""Dune""."
3,Frank Herbert's Dune trilogy,"Although, the Ornithopters(Retractable Flapping Wings, duh...) weren't portrayed correctly, the still-suits needed better design Characteristics(FH actually had a better design in mind as written), and the character of Stilgar(SIC?) was played by 2 different people, the story is more nearly consistent with the authors intent than the previous travesty by Dino De laurentis.(No Shades at all!!!).Pretty good. To the Producers, Designers, Crew, and Directors of this epic. Just for the effort!! 3/4- cool shades. The actors get-The Cool Shades.Martin"
5,About as good as these get.,The book was a treasure of literature. This mini series is about as good as it gets for trying to repeat this story. Geat price. Enjoy.
2,"Nice try, but not cigar. . .","Amateurish acting, costumes that look like they came from a high school drama department, laughable special effects (not all), and, most importantly, totally devoid of Herbert's vision. Anyone who really likes this version does not properly understand Dune.Lynch's Dune is weird and difficult to understand if you haven't read the book, but it is much darker and much closer to Herbert's vision, unlike this version."
2,"Please, don't waste 5 hours of your short life on this film","This movie was a huge disappointment. The acting was abysmal, the story developed silly themes that were irrelavent in the book, the costumes were laughable, and the sets and special effects were hit and miss. I suggest any Dune fans forget that this mini-series was created. In sum, this was one of the worst viewing experiences I can remember."
2,The cash must flow,"Let me say right off that I have not read the book, though I am told that this TV-adaption is true to Herbert's novel.Be that as it may, ""Dune"" clearly suffers from the restrictions of the TV-format. In other words money. An epic like ""Dune"" cannot be done (well) on a TV-budget. Sad but true. The computer generated scenes/backgrounds look cheap in most cases. Only a few of the flight-scenes look OK. Actors are another issue. Less money means worse actors. William Hurt (who plays Duke Leto Atreides) is - of course - one of the few exceptions.There are two reasons why I give it two stars instead of one. Firstly, some of the fight-scenes look pretty good. Secondly, adapting a 'inaccessible' story like ""Dune"" to the screen is bold. And bold TV/movie projects should be rewarded because in these days they are rare.If you want a accurate adaption of the book by Frank Herbert - buy this one. If you want a good movie - get the one by David Lynch."
2,A Disappointment,"I eagerly anticipated the release of this miniseries, being a huge Dune fan. I was, unfortunately, disappointed by the finished product. Now the 1984 movie changed some fairly important plot elements to fit the Dune story into two hours but it did maintain the integrity of the characters. This Dune miniseries also altered the plotline but at the same time made significant changes to the personas of major characteres. As I watched it, I felt that the miniseries was untrue to Frank Herbert's legend, and as the it went on, I became only more convinced."
1,"Awful, Awful, Awful","Awful, Awful, Awful. The acting was terrible. The story all wrong. A waste of money. Do not buy this DVD."
2,Scratches the surface. I didn't enjoy it.,"I think this book is suited for the person who is just getting started in the realm of computer security. This is due to the fact that there is quite a bit of non-Linux specific security tips, like physical security. The downsides to this book are many. Lots of file output and lots of resources to look up but not a lot of content. It just seemed to me like most of this book was filler and I didn't get anything out of it. This is perhaps because I have been involved with Linux and computer security in general for a few years. So, from an experienced systems administrator's point of view: everything in this book is available on the web and can be easily found. However, if you are new to Linux systems administration and security and don't know where to go, this book could be for you."
3,Medium security,"Book ""Maximum Linux Security"" is a good buy for anyone who is new to the Linux world and Linux security and needs fast introduction to the problem. Book can be used as a first reference for the most known security tools, scanners, program holes and terms.If you know what the words ""LIDS"", ""portsentry"", ""ssh"", ""DOS"" or ""ipchains"" means, then you don't need to buy this book. Or, if you have a time to browse the net, you can start digging by yourself."
4,Excellent book,"Although the majority of imformation found in this text could be gleaned from rfc files throughout the internet, it is good to find it in one place and in such a digestable format. An excellent book and a worthy addition to any administrators bookshelf. (I also recomend the excellent maximum security by the same author, which covers a wider range of platforms and is equally comperhensive)"
4,Spmething different,"Finally.. Out of all the ""How to install and administer Linux"" books.. This one actually gets down to the low levels and covers everything else that the other books miss.. and believe me.. its a lot.."
2,Dissapointed,"I've been using linux since 1995. So someone could say that I am not new to the subject. I do not have programming experience but I do know how to tweak a kernel, setup a web/ftp/telnet/dialup server on this wonderful OS. I do posess some experience on setting up an ISP Point of Presence and some experience in systems security. So, someone could say that didn't start using linux yesterday. My opinion is that this book gives linux a bad name. The reason for this is that most of the stuff reviewed in the book doesn't work. Furthermore don't even bother e-mailing anyone, should you encounter any problems, simply because no-one is going to answer back. This includes the author. A dissapointment.P.S. Opinions are mine and mine only."

2,too much copy paste,"I found the book useful in a general kind of way, but the information density is low. I dont' think it's necessary to for example print the entire file list for a tool on 3 pages. Also telling the reader how to unpack a tar file every time....."
2,Do not get it for the software,"If you buy this book to get to the software on the enclosed CD, you'll be disapointed. I could not get any of the software to install without several hours of work. The book works as reference material."
2,Needs improvement,"I've used other products from Sexy Hair Concepts that I liked so I thought I would like this one too. I already have stick straight hair but I just wanted a nice shampoo so I can't really comment on whether or not this would make your hair straighter.As a shampoo, it was mediocre. It was okay but it didn't smell good and I don't feel like it really cleaned my hair that well. I feel like it made my hair feel thicker but in a dry way that left my hair feeling like hay."
5,A great way to keep Doc before us,"This is superb! It made me feel I was sitting right near the stage again, listening to Doc and all the other outstanding musicians on this collection - Merle, T. Michael, Jack Lawrence, Ricky Skaggs, David Grisman, Tony Rice, etc., etc. How can everyone of them play so well? But Doc is the center of inspiration, feeling, and musical virtuosity throughout. I do miss him terribly, but this DVD helps to ease the loss."
3,......,I was very disappointed when it came in the mail the package is crushed could not use as gift like i wanted
3,Not what I exactly thought....,"I was hoping this product came with an ""nondetachable"" loop. But it is ""button/grasped"" so I felt a little disappointed."
2,Problems with buttons,"The service was good and the product is as described, but there is one reason I'm rating it with two stars. I had similar thing and I wasn't happy with it, because it often slipped off my belt (it had a belt clip) or the clip slipped off the case.This one is with loop, but the seller (and the photo) doesn't tell you, that this loop has button, which unbuttons relatively easy and the result is the same - you can easily lose the thing.One more drawback that all the similar products have - the case doesn't protect the lighter very well - the front button may scratch it, because (part of it) appears inside the pouch."
1,So mad at this dimmer,Ok I bought 6 of these cause they were cheap. First one melted a fuse container. No biggie I replaced it. Second one stopped dimming. Ok. Third one the tric fried and ch 3 would never shutoff this one that made me write review caught fire under load of 4 par 38s for 3 hours. I'm very upset
3,Nothing special,"This particular story could be turned into a breath-taking film with the right director. Too much is held back, and the film seemed all too typical. The director does not give a true, gritty, raw look into the troubled life this young girl led, and the story that unfolded. On the bright side, Vincent Karthieser is brilliant, and hes about the only one. Though there is nothing that makes this film stand out as great, it is entertaining, and will keep your attention.Overall, its worth watching. A decent film I suppose. But it wont be one for the ages. It wont be one that will leave you ""shocked"" or ""stunned"". For a true gritty look into the troubled lives of adolesence with a slightly similar story...A movie that will really leave you stunned, watch 'Bully' instead."
3,good for its part,"its good for some time then it wallops in a slow pace, but then the kicker is the muder and the twists and turns. Michael Ironside seems miscast but thats me. Monica Keena and Vincent Kartheiser have a weird chemistry that makes it spark. Jeffrey Wright is awesome in one of his best roles since Basquait. fans will notice Kartheiser because of his Angel fame."
4,"Not definitive, but a start.","This great German/Scot group from Hamburg released eight albums for various lables. This best-of collection focuses mainly, and justifiably so, on their mostly Columbia output from the first five albums. It's a good sampler for those wanting a taste of the band. Their first three albums should really be purchased though, it's not a coincidence that 14 of the 17 tracks on this disc are from those albums. You'd get all the album cuts and not have to have ""Sound Of America"" stinking your CD collection. Also, Amazon states that there is a track (#15) called ""Key To The Future."" No such track exists on this CD."
2,mixed feelings,"This camera is great for taking pictures in great lighting. However, if you like to take pictures at night or in door, the quality is terrible. The zoom is virtually useless. Even in great outdoor lighting, taking a picture with close up zoom will make the pixel very big. I guess you get what you pay. It's a cheap nice looking startup camera. If you are going to honeymoon in Hawaii, this is a great camera. But if you are trying to take pictures of your 2 year old kid, better get a better camera."
1,started great but...,"I spent a lot of time looking for a cooler - they are difficult to find. This one seemed great - large, stainless, looked good... Arrived in good shape and looked great. However, two problems: 1) when you fill this with ice and drinks the sides of the cooler bow outwards a bit - the sides aren't stiff enough given the dimensions and capacity; and (worse...) 2) by the end of the first season of use the legs rusted where the wheels attach to the bottom of the legs. Impossible to repair. I have taken the black legs off the unit and now have it sitting on two upside-down flower pots. Very classy....I'm searching for a new one this year."
1,Piece of crap,Bouught this for a graduation party in June by the end of June the tub delaminated from the stainless steel shell everything is rusting and now water get in between the walls of the unit and the tub is bulged on the bottom. Contacted seller no response. Even amazon guarantee is not responsive. This is a total waste of good money do not buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Not a good product,"The cooler is quite good and keeps ice up to 6 days. However, the wheels on the legs bent (all 4) within the firt ten minutes. I will need to get a welder to reinforce the wheels."
3,Looks good but,"I had the cooler less than a month and the stainless steel sides started to pull away, very disappointing"
1,Very Disappointed on every aspect!,"I ordered not one but two of these coolers for our training center at work. They are not worth the money. Within one month of purchase the wheels started coming off and they can not be repaired because the legs are a hard plastic and the wheels are metal and it breaks where the wheels are connected to the legs. Very disappointed with the the service of dealer (Grady's on line). I have been trying to get new legs for these coolers for over 5 months so I could repair them. I have emailed, emailed, called & called. No Customer service. Just talk. DO NOT order these coolers they are not worth your money. I finally have filed a claim with Amazon. These coolers were inside not on a patio or a deck so it was not from the weather or abuse. Just not made well. To much top weight for the weak little legs. Design is very poor."
1,"If it doesn't fit, you will get bit.","This is a very nice case, except that it does not fit the Treo 300 I purchased it for. Since all the Treos to date are the same size ... I admit it could have been the particular one I purchased, but I could not put the phone/PDA into the case; the top opening was too small. Try something else. Maybe Coach will make one or Amazon will stock one of the other ones available for the Treo."
1,Poorly designed,"I got this item and it's very tight which makes it very hard to answer a call quickly. Taking my Treo out of the case takes quite a bit of effort. My Treo 270 seems to turn on automatically either from the top of the case hitting the power button or the side hitting the jog dial. I can't believe that the top of the case was designed with such a flaw. When closed, it doesn't clear the power button at all. This is junk. I can't use it at all."
4,"A great case, once you break it in","I've been using this case with my Treo 300 for the past 5 months, and I'm very happy with it. As another reviewer has noted, the case out of the box seems too small for the 300. However, with a little wrestling, it's possible to get it into the case, which will soon expand enough to hold the Treo snugly but comfortably.The belt attachment works very well, and the case does a great job of keeping the Treo secure while still giving you quick access. There's a mesh pouch which is supposed to be used for an earbud, but which I use for a paper clip (for rebooting the Treo, which happens more often than I'd like).I've had no problem feeling the vibrating ringer while the Treo's on my belt, but I know some people have had trouble with this."
1,Watch how you order,"The AL8 had been 'repackaged' and the instructions and owner's manual in the box were for a Sony BluRay DVD player (useful, right?). Had to go online to download them from Bose. Installed according to instructions and nothing worked. After many hours of troubleshooting, called Bose Tech Support. The Amazon vendor (Vanns)is not an authorized Bose retailer and the remote control shipped with the Bose Speaker from Vanns was not compatible with my Bose V35 System. When the V35 was introduced, Bose shipped the compatible remote to all their authorized retailers but retailers like Vanns did not receive them. Bose was very nice and shipped me the correct remote for only $99 plus tax, waiving the shipping. Considering I paid the same price at Amazon/Vanns as if I'd ordered through the Bose site, this Amazon purchase cost me $100. Not exactly a savings!"
2,Too much rambling and disjointed,"The book never clearly told a continuos story, too many sub-plots that were ""forgotten"" for most of the book. Read more like a documentary that a mystery thriller I expected"
5,AWESOME!,Im 13. And a HUGE Heat fan. This is what you have to have for not only the holiday season but also for the whole year. I like to listen to all year. ITS THE BEST BUY!
5,One of the BEST Holiday CD's in a long time!,"WOW, that's what I will say first. It doesn't get much better than this. The CD is filled with GREAT NEW ORIGINALS! I'm surprised this CD doesn't get more air-play? There isn't a bad song on this CD.Keep up the good work Ladies, I will recomend this CD to everyone.***** 5 stars in my book.*****"
3,SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR CHRISTMAS,"A LOVEMONGERS CHRISTMAS isn't really a HEART album, but rather Ann and Nancy Wilson's collaboration with non-Heart musicians...it's more AOR and folk/pop rather than the familiar hard-edge rock Heart is associated with.Most tracks are original material, with only 3 traditional songs: a reverent AVE MARIA, a bold a capella O HOLY NIGHT and an instrumental BRING A TORCH. The best tunes are HERE IS CHRISTMAS, LET'S STAY IN and CHRISTMAS WAITS.The main reason the album works is the powerful vocals of Ann Wilson, who has one of rock's finest female vocalists. Whether on softer material like this collection or rocking out on BARRACUDA, Ann has an impressive voice. This CD is a nice holiday alternative and will please an audience looking for something different."
3,ONE well made mallet,This is ONE well made mallet. Good looking. The shaft is slippery and a little hard to grip without slippage.
3,Not so good for a toddler toy--terrible taste!,"If you are getting this mallet for a toddler toy, beware that it has a very strong rubbery taste. My 12 month old really wants to chew on this, but every time she puts it in her mouth she cringes from the taste. I can't speak to the quality of this mallet as a musical instrument, but as a toy I wouldn't recommend."
3,Good...But not his best.,"This is an informative photography book. Based on general ideas of photography such as back lighting and zooming. Informative for the Novice or someone who want to break out of there regular line of photography to get some ideas.I find that Lee's previous books are significantly better and more informative than this one. But, ALL of Lee's book are informative and helpful."
2,Very basic.,Good for beginners in photography. Not recommended for those who are already taken courses in photography or have read other better books. It is also outdated.
5,Vegetarian cooking,"My husband and I have been vegetarians for 10 years and I am always ont he lookout for new recipes. This is one of my favorite cookbooks. The recipes are good, but I also appreciate the thought that was put in to writing in. Eventually I will try his method of capturing wild yeast and making my own sour dough. In the meantime, it is nice to see a cookbook that provides this much detail."
5,Brilliant and Realistic - the Ultimate Vegetarian Cookbook!,"A few months ago I was a total 'newcomer' to the world of vegetarian, vegan and macrobiotic cooking. The whole idea of starting on this new culinary journey was very overwhelming. Now, thanks to this wonderful book from Peter Berley I can say that this culinary journey is turning out to be spectacular and is opening up some amazing new paths into some of the most delicious foods out there that really need to be investigated by any serious cook - be it vegetarian or carnivorous. Peter's recipes very easy to follow. The diagrams and explanations of how to prepare food are wonderful, simple and uncluttered. EVERYTHING that I have made out of this book has been a success. Peter has a knack of adding that certain 'je ne sais quoi' to recipes to make them taste totally yummy. You'll want to make it again and again. If you are looking for the ultimate vegetarian cookbook, then look no further. You won't be disappointed! IT'S BRILLIANT!"
5,A must have for any culinary enthusiast,"Peter Berleys new book is a godsend. Not only for vegetarians and vegans, but for any chef who wants to meet the demands for healthy cuisine in the mainstream. After reading this cookbook, any intimidation you have about natural ingredients and whole foods will go right out the window. Mr. Berley really sums it up in a no nonsense, cool style. If you want to impress your cynical carnivore friends, just prepare a meal from this book, and I guarantee you'll convert at least one person. This book shows that vegan and vegetarian cuisine is about as cutting-edge as you can get, and there are no boundaries. I rate Peter Berley right up there with the best chefs in this country."
5,Peter is a culinary God,"I previously rated this book 4 out of 5 stars, but I've decided that was wrong. This book deserves every star I can give! Every one of the recipes I've tried since I got this book have been delicious.This book is 94% vegan, including the dessert recipes. Peter goes out of his way to make this book vegan friendly and it shows.This book is the perfect companion to The Angelica Home Kitchen and The Voluptuous Vegan. The former is by the owner of Angelica Kitchen and the latter is by one of the former head chefs.I highly recommend this book! It's worth every penny."
4,great bit - not packaged like the photo,"GREAT BITS!If you haven't used a step bit to drill sheet metal, you have no idea how nice they are.You know when you're drilling sheet metal and when the drill punches through, the back side of the hole is really ugly and has sharp things (burrs) attached? A step bit eliminates that, by drilling in steps - just a 1/16"" at a time. Want a 7/16"" hole? Just count the number of steps, and drill that many. Simple.If you have variety of holes to drill of different sizes, you don't have to change bits.Obviously they don't work on thick material.They are pictured with a box (drill index) yet didn't ship with one. At over $50 a set, it would be nice to not have them in a tool box drawer getting banged around. Four stars for lack of a box, while advertising that there is one. The bits deserve five (and protection)."
2,False Advertising,If you aren't going to send these bits in the case that is shown then maybe you should advertise differently. I felt ripped off when I received my item and it did not include the case that was shown. Slick.......
3,Came without a case.,"Good drill bits, but not as advertised - came packed in plastic ""blister"", not in a case like on the photo."
4,Shannon Tweed is Awsome,"The movie was simply awsome. Great sex scenes, plenty of adventure, and of course, plenty of Shannon Tweed."
1,Not worth it at all. Boring.,"This movie was boring and not worth spending a penny on it. The plot was stupid. I wanted to see more of Shannon Tweed, but it just wasn't there. Don't waste your money on this movie. I threw it away after watching it."
1,The Queensland File is vile,"The Queensland File by Julian Jay Savarin should be used in creative writing classes as an object lesson in aggravated assault by cliche. Savarin seems incapable of passing any opportunity to use a worn out trope from the store of espionage fiction. Had the writing any linguistic grace, it would be merely unforgivable. As it is, I am forced to reconsider my opposition to cruel and unusual punishment. The first ten pages deceived me; I thought the book was a parody. By page 40 (rain had trapped me in a coffee shop) I realised my mistake and took refuge in People Magazine where the prose was more professional."
3,Fun alternative to pay per month games.,Fun game to play. A little older than Guild Wars and doeesn't cost you per month to play like WOW.
2,cutaway from this turkey,"I got this film at the library. Thank God, because it was one of the worst films I've seen in quite a while. The plot has Baldwin going undercover as a skydiver to bring down Berenger's character, who has been transporting drugs in the air. I couldn't believe that talented actors such as Berenger and Bahns didn't toss the script in the garbage. Baldwin continues on his decline as an actor. The other performers don't fare any better from Casper Von Dien's playing a GI Joe of skydivers, Ron Silver as Baldwin's boss and Dennis Rodman, too. Thomas Ian Nicholas from the American Pie movies also stars. If you MUST see Cutaway, get it for the amazing skydiving shots. Otherwise, avoid at ALL COSTS."
4,Not getting the HIGH MARKS but still an enjoyable movie,"After looking at the scores I feel this video got a bum rap and deserved no less than a 3.5 average. The actors were good, the story flowed right, it told of real world drug smuggling methods. The roof top stuff was for ""thills"" and it worked even if was not likely. Buy it or rent it, you will surely enjoy this full family movie."
3,Decent action film,"This is watchable action fare which, essentially, is no more than a minor variation on the themes established in films like DropZone and Point Break. There's nothing wrong with that, however, as it's all put together with aplomb. Berenger does look a little pudgy in his jump suit, though. There is nothing new or memorable here but there are worse ways to spend an hour and a half."
2,Thomas Ian Nicholas skydives,"Poor,low budget flick,and thin plot. But,Thomas Ian Nicholas gives a great performance,even with the limited lines and material he was given. He deserves better. The rest of the cast stinks"
1,Try Again!!!,"If I could give this movie zero stars, I would. There is no point and Balwin is terrible. His idea of being tough by talking soft and deep is worthless. Dennis should take the marbles out of his mouth next time."
1,A worthless book,I read this book and all I know is that Leroi Jones changed his name to Amiri Baraka.But all he is... is a frustrated angry man. Full of hate and spite.
1,not deserving much attention,"I think this book took me five minutes to read--a lot of talking, no ideas. Original ones, anyway."
4,a must have item in every home,the light is bright enough for the average applicationit is small enough to keep in a drawyou should have a few in different areas of your home in case of a power failurereasonably priced
5,Great flashlight!,"Maglite is a little late getting into the LED market, but this little lightis a good value and the same Maglite quality."
5,"When buying a flashlight, check out the Mini Mag first!","I have had a 2AA cell Mini Maglite for several years now. Through this time, I have dropped it a lot, but each time, the only damage is scratches. It is so durable that you can just throw it on the ground purposely and it will not be obliterated! The holster is a nice addition so that you can have easy acces when you are in a tight situation.The candle feature is very useful, especially for camping (or night reading). Also, it is water proof! I never have to worry while using it in the rain.Overall, this product is very useful. With its size and capabilities, it prooves worthy to be owned by anyone, no matter what there job is. Note: Another good Mag product is the 4D cell light."
2,Great when they work...a Pain when they do not.,"These are decent lights for navigating the woods in the dark, but if you do...get two of them. They like to cut out often, requiring a sharp rap to get working again...then they work just fine for a bit...and repeat the entire scenario all over again. It is as though the contacts are inferior and unable to provide a constant load to the LED bulb.Why do they send more of those stupid nylon sheaths? I have to have at least twenty of them now over the years, and have yet to actually find any use for any of them.On a positive note, they are plenty bright, and the batteries last quite a while, if they would just always work as they should, they would be great...but they just plain do not...not at all dependable."
3,Good light for the cost and size,"Recently bought this flashlight to keep in the car. The light weight, small size, and inexpensive batteries are all a plus. The light output is better than most incandescent flashlights including the original mini mags but not as bright as physically bigger 3w luxeon LED lights. Light output is very white with a nice slight focusing ability. The added feature of removing the lenscap for a nice bright area light is definately useful in dry weather. Overall this is a perfect light to keep in the glovebox that's inexpensive and well built."
1,Sounds Good,Worked great for a week or so. Good light except after a week or so it won't stay on. You have to shake it and turn it on and off to get it to come back on. I am going to send it back to Mag Light...
5,Just awesome.,"This flashlight is bright. It's solid. It takes cheap, easy-to-find batteries. That's really all you can ask for.In addition, the ""candle mode"" is remarkably good."
3,Malfuntioned quickly due to leaky included battery,"Got the flashlight and it was nicely packaged. Loved the fact that it came with 2 Duracell batteries. Worked great when I tried it out for a few moments. I had bought this size to go into a new holster that I had bought earlier. It fit nicely. I had decided to get a Maglite because they have always been dependable. To my dismay we were out on a call and my light didn't work. Needless to say how dangerous that can be, I was a bit taken back. Luckily, I had a back up for the moment. After the situation had stabilized, I got into the police cruiser to see what might have happened to the light. I opened the end to try replacing the batteries and battery acid sprinkled all over my uniform and the seat of the cruiser. Man, the fellows set in on me for that one. I wish I had a brighter story to tell, but that's the way it went for me. Out a light and a pair of BDU's, but at least the seat is OK."
5,Great Light,"Works as expected, bright light and shipped as promises. Very happy Yada Yada, trying to meet the min word done,"
1,very poor quality,"Apparently, there is no quality control with maglite anymore. They used to be build like tanks, but no more.I bought two of these recently and they both were very poorly assembled. The switch on one was defective out of the box. It just keeps going off. The other one has a deformed barrel, just enough that a battery got stuck in it. Two out of two are bad. I should have paid a fraction of the price for some ""low quality"" stuffs from China - at least I could get some use out of them before they had to be thrown away."
3,it's not perfect but decent,"pros: It is fairly bright in the 100%. the candle mode is sort of useful when working on something in the pitch black and you need both hands.cons: The led housing seems rather poorly placed inside the tube, when working on a car and if you tap the flashlight on anything it will switch modes on you into S.O.S. mode(it blinks in morse code) and it seems to happen quite often.overall for just a normal flashlight to use when walking around in the dark or looking through storage it is decent, but if you are doing anything that involves a lot of movement or tight quarters I'd recommend a different flashlight. I ended up giving this one away and buying theFenix E21 Flashlightthat has a button to switch modes."
4,Its OK,"Difficult to tell if the batteries are running down on the flashlight is malfunctioning. Turns out that batteries that came in the pack were nearly dead upon arrival. The non-led version seemed have a better focusing feature. Even though it has flashing modes and I expect the batteries last longer, I almost prefer my non-LED version."
3,My little go to..,"I love the design of this. It's great to keep in your purse but after keeping it for a while, it uses a lot of batteries. Also it doesn't give me the hi beam type of light I need at night in the dark."
5,"Arrived quick, as I had expected and at good price.","I have all ready got the slightly longer AA LED Maglite, which is used for work.However recently purchase an LED conversion for my AAA maglite, got it wrong? the LED was for a AA conversion so, left with this, saw this AA Maglite on Amazon and thought that will do, so I now have 2 functioning LED Maglite's now, a bit dearer than getting the ready to use one. But I am not out of pocket on having LED sitting in the drawer."
1,PLAIN LEATHER BELT HOLDER REVIEW D CELL,"Don't waste your time or money on the D-Cell plain leather belt holder. You are better off getting a more sturdy version of this at a uniform and supply store, which is a bit more expensive.This version by MagLite has alot of problems.- thin leather- very large loop- weak buttonSo basically, if you really need this (security/LEO's), pass on it. I would rather use a zip tie then hang my maglite on this.Every time I would sit down, the button would pop off, or every time I have to run or jog, the button would pop off.I don't know, if you just need something to temporarily place your maglite in on your belt, it works, because the only thing that does work with this is the plastic D-Cell loop."
4,great for longevity and value,"I've bought expensive tactical flashlights that take the more-expensive 123A batteries. That can be quite costly for everyday flashlight use, so I decided to buy a cheap 2x AA Maglite for the everyday use. It does its purpose and is bright as it can get using two AA batteries. I'm not at all dissatisfied with the product and got exactly what I needed from it: expendable, everyday flashlight use."
5,GREAT DEAL,I was very pleased with my order. Shipping was fast and the quality of my item was just as nice as advertised. I will be buying again..BEING AN ARMY FAMILY WE ONLY WANT THE BEST AND THIS PAST OUR TEST..
4,Bright light,"This little light is bright but right in the center seems to be a dark area? It loses a star for the dark center, you would think the center would be the brightest but it isn't."
4,Good deal -- useless holster,Everything but the holster ... well ... is plain great! I find the flashlights around my local area but they're not at this price. I simply took the holster and got rid of it. They rip and tear off quickly. In a pinch I guess they'd be ok to use one day but that's about all you'd get out it. I have a ballistic holster that I got on Amazon and it's a LOT better and will last for years.
4,Its a MagLite,"There is not much i can say about a MagLite that hasnt already been said its solid, durable, with excellent finish(the silver in my book is worth the lil extra that is my personal) .I purchased a LED replacement 'bulb' that alone says I plan to have this for life."
2,Not as good as it looks,"I have had two of these and they have been nothing but a huge disappointment. Within several months with both lights,the internal contacts began to get corroded and I had to take the light apart to clean then in order for it to work. I had to repeatedly do this every few weeks. I also had brand new batteries on several occasions leak within a very short period of time in both lights. The light was always kept in the house and was never exposed to adverse weather conditions. I'm guessing it was some type of reactions with the types of metals used in the light since batteries from the same package worked fine and never leaked in other devices. These lights appear sturdy and well constructed, but their lack of reliability was very frustrating and both of mine eventually went in the trash and I would never buy another one. When you need a flashlight in an emergency and it tends usually not to work, it's very frustrating."
5,Let there be light,This is one product (apart from a Swiss Army knife) that will never fail you.Go ahead and buy it.
3,"Good, when working.",The light is great when its working at full brightness. It will frequently go to a dimmer version of itself and I have to turn it off and on again to attempt to get it to settle back to full bright. It occasionally turns off right when I need it to be on. Tightening the battery enclosure helps a bit but not completely. I expected a lot better from MAGLITE. About 3 weeks after buying this light I found about $8 cheaper at one of the home centers.
4,"Maglite quality, but.....","This is a nice little pocket flashlight with the Maglite quality you'd expect. Also comes with a nylon holster that you can loop onto your belt. But...- Lacks a one-button on/off switch. You need to twist the head to turn on/off and re-adjust the beam spread each time you use.- Does not come with a lanyard (but does have a mounting hole on the butt end).- Not as bright as the new LED flashlights.Bottom line: If you're a traditionalist, you'll like this item. Otherwise, get a compact LED aluminum case flashlight made in China. You can get a way better performing 21-LED unit of equal quality for half the price."
3,Good light,I ordered the one with an led bulb as it states in the product info but it is a xenon bulb. Contrary to what some people believe they are not the same. An led has a lot longer life and they don't use as much battery power as a xenon. I am debating on whether to send it back.
5,Great LED mini-maglite---very bright!,"If you only have one hand-held flashlight, THIS is the one you want! The LED mini-maglite will light up my entire back yard. Plus, if you turn it on and off quickly, if goes to half power to save battery life. If you turn it on/off a second time it flashes, like an emergency beacon, then on/off a third time and it flashes SOS. Unbelievable! I love mine!"
1,Fell and became totally useless,"This looked like a nice flashlight until it fell. Since then, I can't open the back anymore, so I can't even replace the batteries. (Tried with really strong pliers, but even that doesn't work.) Moreover, the lamp broke in the fall and I can't access the spare the the same reason. Simply had to throw it out. I'd rather have high quality plastic. No more maglite for me."
1,Batteries won't fit,"Got the flashlight but the batteries won't slide in, when I jammed them in the flashlight wouldn't light up, changed bulb with same problem."
3,WARNING wrong reviews,"I have had several maglites over the years and while reading the reviews decided to get this light because it is LED. WRONG, for some reason most of the reviews are on the LED version and this light is the battery eating krypton version.I have drawers full of these old ones and don't use them because they are just old inefficient technology.I was bummed out and requested a refund and planned to refuse the fedex shipment. But when I cancelled the order they said to just keep it. I really don't wont the damned thing but I think it would cost them more if I now refuse the package.Moral quandary.Maybe I'll upgrade it with the LED kit.UPDATE####################I bumped it up a star because it is now perfect since I added the L.E.D. mod kit by Nite-ize.It now has 25 hour battery life and is twice as bright."
3,Not LED as advertised,"I've always been a big fan of Maglite flashlights... and I was excited when I found a camo one on Amazon that was advertised as LED. I'd previously tried a conversion kit to change a Maglite to an LED, but it didn't work out so well, so I thought I'd order one that already had the LED. I opened the package, put the batteries in, and guess what? It's a xenon bulb (which is a great bulb, but not so great on battery life.). Very disappointed in the misleading description. I'll give it three stars because it's a great little flashlight, even though it's not what I wanted, and not what was advertised."
1,"Maglite, you can do better!!!","bought this 2 weeks ago, based on my EXCELLENT experience with Maglites, BUT this one does not live up to Maglite quality.UNLIKE the Mini Mag it is fashioned after, Maglite must have changed something as the rotary on/off switch died after 2 weeks. Guess I'll try the competition......."
1,2 defectives in a row?,"I bought 2 of these flashlights, and both stopped working within 2 days of purchase. Why can't maglite use the rear push switch like so many others?"
1,Piece of junk,"This flashlight does everything except be a flashlight. Not sure how the switch is made, but if the light is banged or bumped the light turns to the next mode which includes SOS or dim, etc. Please just turn on and stay on, and it doesnt do that. Bought two, never again, returned one, need to get rid of the other. Steer clear of this junk, this light makes you want to smash it it is so annoying using it for work and it bumps and starts blinking."
5,Perfect size and brightness,"I really like this little mag-lite.It is a perfect size to keep in my pocket, or in my glove box and is plenty bright for my needs.You just can't beat the quality of MAG-LITE!"
4,4 stars,"Over the years, doodles on the Google homepage have made searching on Google more fun and enjoyable for its users worldwide. When doodles were first created, nobody had anticipated how popular and integral they would become to the Google search experience. Nowadays, many users excitedly anticipate the release of each"
5,Can't go wrong with a maglite!!!,I have a full sized Maglite that is just plain awesome! I bought this small one for a friend who likes purple stuff and she loved it.
5,"Rugged, water proof, bright, versatile","I've dropped my Maglite onto hard floors, submerged it in water, and subjected it to the abuses of a tornadic four year old. The all metal (not plastic!) case is nearly indestructible. Both ends are threaded and are fitted with snug o-rings to protect the innards from rain, humidity, and submersion. The lens housing twists to adjust the focus of the beam and comes off to allow it to be used as a candle (handy for nights in a tent or during a power outage). In addition, an extra bulb resides in the base!"
1,Quit working Thanks,After 8 months and a return not available it stopped working / garbage. Worked great the first 8 months then nothing. Bill
1,not what they used to be,maglite used to be the standard for good flashlites. not anymore. this one has poor illumination and uses batteries like there's no tomorrow. The battery cap doesn't want to thread back on. And it should have a toggle instead of a screw on/off switch. and there's no replacement bulb. and several times when the batteries have been replaced the bulb blew out and they're difficult to find. a piece of S***!
4,Maglite holder,This maglite holder is great for the worker that carries a maglite. As I gave it to my Husband and now he has something secure to hold his flashlight without worrying about it dropping while working.
4,Keeps your Maglite handy and ready to use.,This is a must have item if you need to carry your MagLite with you while you're working. The only down side to its design is the weight of the 6D cell MagLite will eventually cause the snap holding the together to fail.It will take a lot of abuse before it does fail and it sure beats holding the flashlite all night long.
5,A Winner,"I bought this light for use here in Iraq, It fits perfectly in the Molle vest loops and has a nice bright light that has been used to blind unexpecting people in the night, when they don't comply. It's that bright. You can get brighter but not better."
3,Doesn't play well with rechargable NiMH batteries,"I used to have an incandescent mini maglite, and I really liked it. When I lost it, I thought I'd upgrade to an LED version. I was disappointed. As far as brightness goes, there doesn't seem to be a great difference between my old maglite using NiMH batteries and the LED maglite with alkalines. The beam is more uniform in the LED version, but I find the bluish tint to be harder to see in than the reddish incandescent light. My main complaint, though, is that the LED version didn't work properly with my NiMH batteries. It produced a very dim, barely visible light with one set of older, fully charged NiMH batteries I had. When I tried a higher capacity, fully charged set, it didn't produce any light at all. I'm returning this version and getting an incandescent version instead."
5,Really works Great,Led is so much better & brighter than standard flashlight there is no comparison. Mag-Lite quality only adds value.
4,great usage,I use this with the electronics systems I work on. coupled with the starter kit (mostly the red lens attachment) it comes in highly useful. The multi mode is highly effective and allows the flashlight to be used in multiple different kinds of scenarios. I don't go much of anywhere without it
5,fits perfectly,I bought this for my security job and it makes carrying my 3D maglite easier especially while carrying 3 sets of keys.
4,Maglite are the best in the world,This item is really well made and works great.Powerful beam and easy to use.Pros: good quality productCons: I could not find anywhere if is ok to use rechargeable batteries....and I still don't know
5,"Great Maglite product, as usual","Fantastic little flashlight, just what you would expect from Maglite. Small enough to fit in an emergency kit or household toolbox, yet bright enough to fix a leaking sink at midnight with the power off."
1,Two lemons,"I bought two of these last year, and they both died within a few months. I looked for replacement bulbs, but the ones that are available are upgrades, which I wasn't sure if they would fit (since the upgrades are for the incandescent maglites, and I'm not sure if the reflectors are different). So I went to the Mag Instrument web site, and they say that these 'internal parts' are not 'user serviceable'. That, along with a serial number for a small flashlight, is utterly pretentious. Very disappointing. I've always liked Mag products, but these were duds (they were used so little that the cases don't have a scratch on them). I'm willing to pay extra for quality products, but these unfortunately don't qualify."
1,Avoid the Maglite LED 2A if a flashlight is critical for your job or security,"My LED2A failed, as did for many others. If your job or security depends on a flashlight, DO NOT PURCHASE IT.Do not be impressed by the design. The innards are junk."
1,horrible,"horrible battery life. I put top of the line batteries in this flashlight and it lasted maybe one week. I used this flashlight for about 2 mins, once a week, and the battteries would die. Do Not Recommend"
5,works!,light weight..fits in my jean's pocket sideways.....perfect for walks at night with our dog....puts off enough light.....would like more but it's enough.
1,A Joke!,"I bought this flashlight after seeing all the advertising for Maglite. What a disappointment! It is small and puts out maybe 20 lumens of light, if that. The lumens are so low that Maglite never even lists the lumens on any of its products, unlike its competitors.This thing might make a decent booklight but that is not what I bought it for. For the same price at this over-hyped, underperformer I could get a flashlight 5x as powerful!"
3,This is a Toy not a Tool,"This is a rare time when the traditional version is better than the LED version.This Mag 2XAA LED flashlight has a flash mode feature that starts after the light has been on for a while. The light makes an OK children's toy, but it cannot be used as a tool.The Mag 3XAA LED and D-cell LED flashlights without this ""special feature"" work great. The 2XAA LED is a hopeless mess, even after stretching the spring and doing the fixes other buyers suggest.Even the non-LED traditional Mag Krypton can be used as a dependable tool.Ultimately, I suggest buying the 3XAA LED or a different brand.1-STAR rating as a tool.5-STAR rating as a children's toyAverage rating = 3-STARS"
1,Why cheat your customer???,"Why cheat your customer with such a high price, (nearly double)? And then try to suggest that is is actually one-half off? Would it not make more sense to price them in accordance with the normal marketplace and point out the virtues of the camo to hunters, campers, etc? Count me out."
1,Expensive and doesn't work,It arrived today -- can't turn it on. Pricey too for such a little thing! REFUND
1,DID NOT GET MY ITEM!! WHY?????????,"I can not rate this item because I did not get my package! I ordered it 18 days ago and it did have tracking info for the first few days. Now it's tracking info is unavailable and I have no clue where it is! Now thanks to Amazon not knowing where my product is, I am now very upset! I WOULD BE CAREFUL ORDERING THIS ITEM YOU MAY NOT GET IT!!"
2,Aren't too clear I my thoughts for this book..,"This book is, like another reviewer though, lacking. It has more pictures and illustrations - which are beautiful - and less real, hard-core information on Earth Magick. It also has more spells then you even know what to do with - which is good if that's what you're looking for. I on the other hand, was looking for more of a historically factual book then a spells and ritual book. If you're looking for information, go else where to find it. If you're looking for simplistic spells, you're right on the money with this book. I believe that your view of this book has to depend on what you were looking for before you bought it, truthfully. So, I guess I was looking in the wrong place.."
4,What a wonderfully simplistic book! :),This book is definatly for great for people who like simplistic spells....they really aren't rituals. They are for those who are short on time. I really like how the books use a lot of emphasis on using the *EARTH* to help you. I am pagan and have learned it to mean that paganism is about *earth-religions* however most of the books I have read have very little to do with interacting with the nature outside and around us.
3,for one who wants to practice alone,"Scott Cunningham has always been a fav for books relating to the craft, i have never liked the idea of working within a coven so his books have been great and encouraging for those who prefer to walk a solitary path.Earth Power has lots of interesting ideas for becoming more in-tune and working with nature and the elements...I recommend getting earth, air, fire and water written by Scott Cunningham as well. This is not my favourite of his books but its still a good one, check his other books!!"
4,not just for wiccans,"I consider myself a Christian and even though this is a wiccan book, I love it. God created the Earth; therefor, everything should be honored and venerated in respect for Him, but worship is due to God alone. and just as we venerate the Saints and invoke them, the same can be done with the Earth elements as they are icons of God - their Creator."
3,Earth Power review,"Book did'nt deliver entirely as promised. When I looked inside (as offered) the book displayed wonderful pictures by""Robin Wood"". The edition that I got had no pictures in it. Granted the information tought by the author is more important but the pictures that were shown as being in the book and were not were most inspiring and would have added to the overall learning experience. Not having the pictures in the book as advertised was a big disappointment!!!!!Earth Power: Techniques of Natural Magic (Llewellyn's Practical Magick)"
3,strays off the mark,"Cunningham writes great books about Wicca. His Guide for the solitary and Living Wicca were instant classics. However, this work, like a few others of the ""practical"" type, is NOT as quality a work as those.This is a workable field guide to tools and techniques, but not something worth more than a quick perusal.Go offline, get to your local big bookstore and order a giant hot cocoa and a cookie. Read the book in the cafe, and leave it there."
2,Earth Power,"This book didn't really jive with me. The writing was just way too simplistic. I guess I thought I'd get a book that was more in depth. This wasn't it.I did end up giving this book away to someone who was looking for a copy. They were tight on cash, I wasn't looking to keep this book, so I passed it on to them."
2,Somewhat childish,I didn't find this book as great as other readers have but I must admit that I didn't read it thouroughly. As I remember I got the impression that it was more about using the earth as a resource then using you're mind.
3,Simple book on basic magic and how it works.,"Beginners will love this easy to read book. Easy to understand techniques and explanations, this volume is well written and a good investment for those wanting to learn more about basic magic."
1,Very dissapointing,"1. Very poor quality edition: the book has a lot of pictures. The quality of pictures is unacceptable. You can hardly see the details. 2. Content: They do not give the whole theory or complete description of principles, just a lot of pictures with brief comments. Summary: about 5% of the book you may consider useful."
4,Good book for beginners interested in Shaolin Kung Fu!,"This book by Douglas Wong is very informative and useful as it illustrates the practical uses of Shaolin Kung Fu. He has very good introductory sections on the ranking system in the temple, salutations as well as the various types of punches and hand techniques used. There are also sections on the philosophy behind Kung Fu and the internal system. For $6.00 this book is a steal!"
5,One great book!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Douglas wong, founder of the modern day ""white lotus"" system. In this book you will learn the basic of the shaolin style. Very good book."
5,Great hip hop album,"I wasnt a big fan of Nas until I heard One Mic, off of Stillmatic, so I decided to buy it, and loved it, then bought Lost Tapes and loved it even more. So it was only right for me to buy God's Son. Ok, It might not have the creativity that Stillmatic and Lost Tapes has, but the knowledge he spreads on the cd makes artists like Commom look like high school drop outs. Songs like ""I Can"", ""Revolutionary Warfare"" and ""Heaven"" can teach alot more about life than a text book can. Other songs I really like on God's Son are ""Get Down"", ""Book of Rhymes"" and ""Mastermind"". If you liked Stillmatic and The Lost Tapes, you will definitly like his new cd. Its no longer Nasty, Escobar or Nastradamus, Its God's Son era now."
4,Better than Stillmatic?,"I don't know. But I bought 4 CD's over the last week, Snoop Dogg, Swizz Beatz, Tupac and this. This and the new Tupac Cd's are incredible. It makes Snoop seem Average and Swizz Beatz seem like 10 year old trash! Anyway this album is worth it, my drawback is that the album is too short."
4,nas gods son,rebecca you relly irratated me with your ignorant review we all understand your a jigga fan but please respect hip hop. I dont understand where you are going with bloated and unnecessay guest appearances THUGZ MANSION is one of the hottest joints on the album.I also dont understand why critics always try to compare JAY Z and NAS its criticzm like this that starts beef why cant we all just settle down and listen to the artists and enjoy the fact that there all here to speak and entertain us.I admit some of the beats are a little loopy but overall for NAS I give this album an 8 1/2
3,NOT WHAT IT'S HYPED UP TO BE,"Nas is trying too hard. To me, this is by far the worst Nas album that I ever heard. He should have waited for a little while and put more into it. If you are a Nas fan, then you might want to check it out. If not, leave it alone."
1,This album should not get any mics or stars!!!,"Back in the day we all once knew of a cat around the way straight out of NYC called Nas who dropped some of the illest rhymes and beats when he came out with albums ""Illmatic"" and ""It was Written"".Nas also dropped some of the illest guest appearances in many other artists albums that I have ever heard but like the saying goes ""What goes up must come down"".Nas was at the top for the longest time but as time went on he started putting less work into to his albums which isn't hard to tell which is why he is soon to fall off.On this album his has maybe at the most 4 tight songs but those songs don't even touch some of his best ones he had earlier in the years before..If your a Nas fan you gotta wonder how much more trash is he going to put out.."
1,Sorry Nas,"I wanted to like this album--I really did..but no matter what I just can not get into it. It's just far too blah for a hip hop album. Well Nas, Im gonna give you what you always wanted--1 mic. Im sorry :(Buy the Lost Tapes though"
3,What happened?,"I personally thought Stillmatic was Nas' comeback to being appealing to me,but ended up making me sleep.This CD isn't of his best work,but if you want another CD by him.....pick it upIf you listened to ""Made you look""(as did I) and thought it was gonna be that song all the way through the CD,don't get itBut if you want a more deep Nas,pick up the album,and you'll probably be happy with it."
5,god's son,this cd is the ish and everyone needs to buy it cuz nas is still keepin it real and jay-z ain't got jack on nas. if you think he does then you really LISTEN to the rap!
2,god's son needs help,this album is wack i tried to listen to it i cant feel itthis lost tapes is way better than this waste of a cdsorry blueprint 2 is better !
5,One Amazing Piece of Art,"Iight everyone knows Nas is dope. But when the beef with jigga statred to heat up and so did the comparision. but how could you compare these two styles. Also if it was fair nas has one that battle. even from the begining on ""get down"" it is apparent that Nas means business this time around. Also another intruiging track is ""the cross"" produced by eminem! if that wasnt enough he drops so lyrical magic on ""heaven"" just to prove that this nigguh can rhyme. Ohh and the limited addition cd was a nice bonus"
4,Yet another tight entry from Nas,What else is their to say about Nas? The man's lyrical skill is one of a kind. Their are few artists and I mean few who can drop albums which r different in their own right. That's what separate Nas from a lot of other artists. I get so sick of people saying that he fell off since illmatic. Even the editors on this site said tha same crap. Those editors and whoever think that need to get a grip. It ain't about making another illmatic cause that chapter is done. Being consistant is whats important which is why he is still in tha game today(Unlike Jay-Z who pretty much ran out of sh*t to say). Another thing I can say about Nas is he been an independent artist his whole career without a crew or group to roll wit. He don't need a group like g-unit to stay in tha game. Being the last real ni**a alive is an understatment for Nas and any Nas fan wouldn't tell u any different. I give it 4 stars out of 5 by tha way.
1,Jay is the King,"This album is proof that Jay-Z is the king.There is a good reason why Jay's numbers dwarf Nas'--the streets want Jay Z!Dispite Nas having his OWN release date, the album has been a huge disappointment for everyone involved, especially the fans."
1,how annoying can this be,"this is the same music as ""50 cents"" albums, same music, same lyrics, same songs, its amazing people shell out money for the same thing, only thing that changes is the artists name...boyzzzz!"
1,Disappointing,"I enjoyed the Lost Tapes, but this CD is really weak and a HUGE disappointment. Nas may have won the first battle, but after this stinker, Jay Z has won the war."
2,yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!,"yeee diggoo nas be de five percents ob de booboo dookie on de side and wang doodle ya mamma twice ya feel me an what not nome sayn, word. Jibee jabbee on ya mamma cuz I bes a God and she bes de earth gots de top secrit doodad on de sista giblets an what not.

Erykah Badu I break it down an what not: BADU is bad for you. Word. Erykah is reek as in stank nome saym. Nas is Nukka Aint S*** ya feel me. Breakin it down like we do ina five percent tip. Word."
3,It is ok,"This isn't Nas's best work, but It isnt his worst either.Check out cuts like ""Hey Nas"", ""Made You Look"".Add this to your collection no doubt, but don't expect another Illmatic."
4,heres a rapper,nas is a very good rapper he isnt all gnagsta and all that crap he has talent he is one of the most best rappers out there thats in my opinion but anyways keep on rapping nas
3,Disappointing after Stillmatic,"Nas dropped the epic Stillmatic and returned tohip hop glory. Afterward, he released a remix album and his bootlegged tracks The Lost Tapes(he should have combined the two). Then he returns to us with God's Son. This definiely has its moments, including Made You Look, Book Of Rhymes, Last Real N***a Alive and the positive anthem I Can(which black radio should give more spins, but of course won't, but that's another story). But the good songs are few and far in between;but at least he's lightbyears ahead of his rival Jay-Z, who's last few albums have been straight up garbage. Nasty Nas is here to stay,and thank goodness for that!"
5,"4.5 Stars, The REVIVAL OF NAS!","Unlike previous CDs, Nas combined catchy beats and deep lyrics. It did change for the better, and its one of my favorite nas CDs.If you liked the songs Made You Look and I Can then pick this up.Best songs are...Made You LookThe CrossBook of RhymesI CanHeavenPussy Killsand more..."
1,make it stop,"derivative non-sense. then again, most rap and/or music is nowadays, so he nothing new. hes just another shill only in the business for money, spwing out some words with no feeling or reasoning behind them, using random sounds for the back beat. he thinks hes jesus, i mean come on! does anyone know what the fur elise is? if not, then by all means, buy this piece of garbage. you have no taste in actual music anyway. fah. im moving to sweden. they make real music there."
2,'God's Son' Doesn't Live Up To The Hype,"I should start by saying that I am a big Nas fan and think that he is one of the best lyricists in the game. 'God's Son' is Nas' follow-up to the classic 'Stillmatic'. Nas doesn't acknowledge his beef with Jay-Z that much on this album although he does have a track dedicated to it called ""Last Real Ni**a Alive"". The few standout tracks are ""The Cross"" (produced by Eminem), ""Warrior Song"" (produced by Alicia Keys), and ""The G.O.D."", found on the bonus disc (produced by Swizz Beatz). This album fails to live up to the usual creativity and excellence of Nas. It's a good album to pick up but it's not the best of the year."
1,Boring,"This CD is boring. Nas used to be great, but he is a shell of his former self. His flow is tired, his subject matter is mediocre, and his choice of guest spots is nothing short of atrocious. Why did Nas think it was a good idea to have Alicia Keys, Claudette, Kelis, and Bravehearts on his album? The single ""Made You Look"" is wack, but sadly it ends up being one of the brighter spot on this CD filled with worthless drivel. Nas officially needs to hang it up, and just admit that he lost the war to Jay-Z."
1,weak wanna be prophet rapper,"ok enough of the small talk about this dumb cd , its plain and simple DUMB it has no sense to it , ""gods son""??? , ok its said by the title that is dumb , he trys so hard to act like 2pac and like a prophet....man i will give him a 0 if they allowd it...with these lyrics his going no where........"
2,remember when hip hop was synonymous with TRUE expression?,"there once existed an emcee who had the ability to paint landscapes of haunting beauty.....told stories so detailed that you could literally invision yourself in the same position or situation....acquired the privileged ability to flow like hot descending pop corn butter into an empty bag....this emcee could battle any other contender out there....now, sadly, he has been consumed by the commercialism that he so vehemently & naturally went against....bye for now NAS....until we meet again...until music is once again emblematic of ART...shall you join us?? let's hope...."
5,Escobar season has returned!,"Amazing! This album has an old school feel to it. It is so refreshing to hear quality material that comes from the heart . Songs like I Can and Dance are inspirational and spiritual. Get Down, The Cross , Revolutionary Warfare are just pure HEAT!!!!!!! I'm loving it. Cop this if you want to hear real street hop!!"
1,Yawn,"Nas has fallen off and fallen off hard. I never want to hear ""King of New York"" and Nas in the same sentence--EVER. This CD is wack, and the Bravehearts are wack. Too bad Eminem didnt at least spit a verse on the Cross. Oh well. This CD is a dud. If you want to support Nas, buy Illmatic or Lost Tapes-not this ...."
4,Marylandemcee,This album is worth the buy.But you can't injoy the full effect without knowing where he started. so Illmatic should also be on mind.I have all but streets deciples. it's worth it ..very well done
5,"NAS.. ""God's Son""","This Album cant be compared to what is out there today. Nas has true talent to throw out some wicked lyrics that make you contemplate. ""You slave to a page in my rhyme book"" - Made you look. (Book of rhymes)- shows how he can be rhyming about one thing and jump from subject to subject and make it into a song. The acoustic version of Thugz Mansion with 2pac puts you in that relaxed mood. All i have to say is NAS is back on top.."
5,The Best So Far,"Nas has come along way since his first entrance in Hip-Hop, this CD is like he says ""very personal"" it mentions alot of stuff that he went through and was put through as a child/teenager/and even a Man. I give this CD 5stars. Good luck on upcoming products Nas -1 Love While Using 1 Mic-"
4,Nas is back!,"I hardly buy CD's anymore because most new stuff is pure MP3 material. I remember the days of underground rap(31 years young)...back when you could count on something hot to come out. I mean, even REDMAN is mainstream now. This Nas CD isn't perfect, there are a couple of tracks I'd send back to pen and pad, but the lyrics are tight and it has HEART! It's not all written for radio, as Nas speaks on his Jay-Z beef. There are few tracks (Zone Out) that have a nice old school feel that I can appreciate. I know I'll be bumpin this for some time to come. Oh yeah! there's also a track with Tupac. My guess is Nas completed one of Tupac's unfinished tracks, or was inspired by Tupac's idea."
3,3.5 stars: Not quite the follow up to Stillmatic that I was expecting.............,"The God's Son joint is just okay, could've been better.Top Joints:Made You Look (Classic)Book of Rhymes (Love it)Last Real N*gga (Breaks down the battle for King of NY)I Can (Deep, impressive- identical to BDP's ""You Must Learn"")Heaven (For his Moms)Zone OutMastermind (Indeed)"
1,Not what i wanted,Disappointing effort from Nas. Time to go back to the drawing board with rejuvinated lyrics and better production. Better luck next time.
2,i don't even want to give it one,"i'm disappointed in nas; how in the world can you talk about the same thing, on every album, and you still think you're the best? i know record sales don't depict just how good you really are, but they do tell you whether or not people are buying your albums; if your sales are low, people aren't buying. if people will buy albums like trick daddy's, chingy's, and lil' john, something's obviously wrong with your music; get some new material."
1,Booo...,"This CD is awful and the terrible Zone Out and Hey Nas are just the frosting on the cake. Truly disappointing that the once promising MC from the early 90's has turned into this..a shell of his former self, a beaten down man. 1 star..and Im feeling kind."
2,OK,"Nas is extremely talented and the beats on this CD are strong. I like the tunes, but am a little disturbed that some people listening to this CD may actually believe some of what he's saying. i naively assumed we were outgrowing racism and bigotry, but Nas effectively epitomizes both and rubs them in your face. if you want knowledge, read a book; if you want to bob your head, listen to this CD and try not to pollute your brain with his drivelling lyrics."
2,Blessed&Cursed Rapper,Nas really started out with a Bang as a Artist&showcased a Raw Talent.but then over time He has become Hit&Miss&depending on the subject matter somethings work&others are just taking up CD space.this Set fits that spirit.with Nas you never know which direction&stance He is gonna take&Nas Himself seems not too know as well.lets get a few things straight:He is a Far Better Lyricist than Jay Z.and Can Flow on a groove with Him equally.but the battle seems too be hurting Nas more so than Jay Z&that is a easy answer too that.Nas has more as a Artist too offer but He is being baited into a mindless duel that does nothing for His Skills.Him&Jay Z are too different type of Artists&different Musical Appeals as well.Nas starts off Good&then sinks over time on this set.
1,Disappointment,"There is only one word I can use to fairly describe this album--disappointment. After the Lost Tapes I was anxious to hear some more Nas material--what I got was a rushed package that consists of too many R and B singers, kids choirs, and worst of all- The Bravehearts. Nas tries so hard to outshine Jay Z-that he put out the second worst album of his career. Nas-Shame on you for putting out such a wack album. Better luck next time."
2,Not what I hoped for,I was hoping Nas would put out another classic--instead we get this uninspired drivle. Looks like Nas got shook by you know who--thats sad.
4,i wish i could give it 5 stars,...but i cant... tha beats arent there... tha lyrics are incredible and i really luv those but tha beats are p00r...hook up wit sum1 with good beats... by far Nas is tha best east coast rapper right now... if yu like tha rest of Nas's albums.. buy this one
4,Emotional Brilliance,"God's Son is a BRILLIANT album, filled with emotions from my favorite MC Nas. Nas had just lost his mom (R.I.P.) and his emotion shows in this album. It's EXCELLENT from start to finish. The first time I played this album, I have to admit, I wasn't thoroughly impressed. But after the second listen, I released that this was Nas, still at his best. Here's the review:Album Highlights: The entire album, EXCEPT the song with the Bravehearts (Zone Out) and the song with Kelis, with all due respect to this soon to be wife (Hey Nas)Production: Thumbs upLyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs upOriginality: Thumbs upThe Last Word: Nas did it again. As mentioned before, this is one BRILLIANT album, filled with so much emotion and grief that you just HAVE to listen to fill Nas' pain. This album also surpasses Jay-Z double CD (Blueprint 2: The GIft and The Curse) released the same month. Overall, I stronly recommend this album."
3,A Competent Nas Album,I really don't understand why Nas just didn't put some of his better but older songs from the Lost Tapes on this album and took out the filler. Now this would have been a classic interchangeable with Illmatic. This is way better than Jay-Z's miserably awful double album effort.Highlights are:Made You LookBook of RhymesGet DownLast Real N**** AliveHeavenThe CrossI CanP**** Kills
4,This is straight STREET-HOP!,One of the best albums ever made! An album full of QUALITY songs when a good rap album is so very hard to find these days.A marvelous look into the life and mind of one of raps greatest stars.Don't waste your money on anything from Jay-Z or Roc-a-fella.
5,GOD SON/ THERE'LL BE NONE AFTER,"I've had this for about two months, and I haven't stopped listening to it yet. That's just how good it is... granted, it's not Illmatic, but who on this earth can make an album that amazing? Nas brings it real on this album... even though it won't sell as much as BP2, it's way better. There's not a song to skip on this album (Zone Out, maybe), but otherwise, it's just a tight album. Nas hits you hard with Get Down and doesn't let go until Zone Out... The Bravehearts can not rap. From track 6 on, Nas grabs you and refuses to let go. Notable songs are Book of Rhymes (Classic Nas!!! Let's see Jay-Z do this!!!!) Warrior Song (I've never been a fan of Alicia, too overrated, IMO, but she and Nas make an OUTSTANDING song here), and Heaven (Jully Black's a newcomer, but the chorus is great and Nas brings some thought-provoking lyrics.) Please go pick this up!!!"
3,Nas-Gods Dud,"this is a decent cd,dont get me wrong,but it is not a good follow-up album 2 stillmatic.thys is tha reason nas fell off tha first tyme,and thys is y jay-z is gettin all thys luv going n 2 retirement and nas haz been forgotten about again.thys album has its moments but he should have came stronger,now jay-z haz exited tha game az tha king of new york,while nas is just a braveheart(lol)."
4,nas is still king of nyc,"Nas can still, even with all the commercial hip-hop out right now, come up with an album that pleases everyone. People are saying Nas is so soft right now because his mom died while he was making this album. Well to me Nas is a better lyricist because of it. Many songs on here deal with ""Keepin ur head up"" and livin ur life to the fullest. Don't down Nas just because his mom passed away, he is still number 1 on my book. Nas is the best rapper alive right now, no contest."
2,I'm just not feelin it!,I don't know why he thinks he's in 2pac's or biggie's class.Atleast everybody enjoyed their music.This guy comes off flat to me. He has 2 songs that i like #6( I can) and #13(heaven)but the rest are o.k. to listen to about once or twice a month.
4,GOD's Son,"BEING THAT I USE TO BE A STR8 UP HARDCORE FAN OF NAS TILL THE LIL SWITCH WITH IT WAS WRITTEN, THIS ALBUM IS A MUST BUY, I AM ALSO GLAD TO SEE NAS AINT SAY NOTHING BOUT CORMEGA, FACE IT, IT TOOK NAS ALMOST 5 YEARS TO ACTUALLY DISS MEGA, YOU DONT WANT IT!! I WONT HATE CUZ THIS ALBUM IS CLASSIC MATERIAL. THE LAST REAL ... ALIVE-GOES DEEP INTO THE ROOTS OF THE BIGGIE BEEF AND WITH JAY-Z WHICH IS A TIGHT SONG. BUT THE SONG DANCE- WHICH IS DEDICATED TO HIS MOTHER WHO PASSED AWAY IS VERY DEEP AND TO THE HEART. THE ONLY TRACK THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DROPPED WAS TRACK 2 BY EMENIM, PLEASE, WHAT A WASTE. GOOD ALBUM GO HOLLA AT IT. ALSO CHECK OUT FATAL OF THE OUTLAWZ NEW ONE!!!!!!!"
4,Big ups to the true living King of hip-hop,"This is a good album. Maybe not Nas' best. But it's a solid follow-up to one of the best hip-hop albums in recent history (Stillmatic). The ""Last Real Nigga Alive"" is a solid track. It's basically a brief story of how the rap game was in the 1990's as seen through Nas' eyes. And I thought ""Book of Rhymes"" was very creative. ..."
4,Can Nas make a bad cd?,"Another hot cd from Nas, he remains the king of hip-hop, every song is complete and lyrically amazing, new beats, alicia keys, 2pac, and city high on some of the featured artists on this cd.The cd is not as good as Illmatic,( no cd ever will be) therefore it only gets 4 stars"
1,Not what I wanted,Nas' God Son is a very disappointing album. I miss the creativity Nasir used to bring in to the game. Nas now seems lazy and uninspired. I hope he calls it quits bfore its too late.
4,GOD'S SON? THAT'S FOR SURE.,THIS CD IS GOOD IT HAS SOME REALLY GOOD SONGS ON IT FOR INSTANCE THE WARRIOR SONG I LOVE THAT SONG BUT THERE ARE SOME SONGS ON THIS CD THAT ARE GOOD AT THE BEGINNING AND GRADUALLY GET ANOYING.IF I WERE YOU I WOULD GET THE CD BUT DON'T LISTEN TO IT OVER AND OVER.
4,Nas better then Jay-z??,"Whatever what everybody says,I don't think nas is better then jigga and i don't think Jigga is better then Nas.Let's forget the beef,Biggie is still the king of East Coast and jigga and Nas knows it.Let's talk music for once:This C.D is not the best of Nas but it's still great.the first song ""Get down"" is excellent,the Eminem production is very good and I think all the songs have a grade (7 or 8 out of ten except Warrior Song wich has 10 out of 10 and P***y Killz wich is 4 out of 10).We don't need to compare Nas' album to Jigga's one,but Nasir jones does a great C.D on this one.I think it's his last album but I hope not.Buy this album if u like the N.Y sound"
5,Nas Does It Again,"I can't even describe the anticipation that surged through me when I stuck this CD in my car on the way home from the store. Almost immediately, it's bangin'. As soon as I heard ""Made You Look"" I knew that the album was going to be one of the top ones of the year, and I can tell you that it crushes ""The Blueprint 2"" into the dust. Buy this album even if you don't like rap. It's great."
3,It's OK,"It's an ok album, I don't regret buying it, but Nas does get tired after a while, and bravehearts need to go, they are wack...some tracks were hot (made you look, and warrior song), ""I can"" was hot too, very inspirational, but the cd is definitely not skip-free, I think I actually just listen to about 8 songs on the cd, the rest are wack."
4,Nas shows his sorrow with a historic LP,"Since the passing of his moms....nas shows his sorrow through his lyrics in ""God's Son"" Listen closely and you can hear what I am talking about. Check out tracks 2,3,4,and 8."
5,GOD'S SON!,"This album is banging!!! 5 mics, 10/10 whatever, its another classic. How many rappers can say they have 3 classic albums in one year?? I can't get enough of this cd, I think I'm going to have to buy two copies, one in my car, and one at home."
4,Best MC around,"""This CD is awful and quite frankly an insult to hip hop. Nasir-hang it up before its too late...PLEASE.""Whoever wrote this brain-dead comment needs to be taught a lesson..how can you say that this album is an insult to hip-hop when no-one, I mean NO-ONE, has a flow as tight as Nas in contemporary mainstream hip-hop? How can you dismiss track after track of near flawless spitting? Admittedly some of the beats and hooks are a bit ropey, but WHAT? an INSULT to hip-hop?you don't seem to know what hip-hop is!"
1,"""This Album is weak. ""!!!!","Nas Change Since Illmatic, His skills are good but his performence is terrible in his album""Nas is the 4th hottest MC"" In the lead with 2Pac, Biggie, & Eminem. Nas in ""Stillmatic"" proved that no one could reach to his skills today. as for many of his songs are just not the same as other tracks he played in ""The Lost Tapes"".Nas did a good job in fixing an album to the ""Bravehearts"" in Late 2003. Nas Lyrics are hott in this album as always there's something about the track's that makes it boring to listen to."
3,3.5 Stars,"God's Son is the album that followed Stillmatic, so he should have tried harder with this one. It has great songs like Made You Look and Last Real Nigga Alive, but could've been better. MUST HAVE."
5,something before church or masjed,this lp WILL GET U FEELING RIGHT. SOMETHING THAT I LISTEN TO BEFORE GOING TO CHURCH OR MASJED
4,Must have for hip-hop fans,"It's simple... if you like Hip-Hop you have to buy this CD. It's the second CD in my current rotation. (First is Talib Kweli : Quality, second God's Son, third 50 Cent - Guess Who's Back). Not as good as Illmatic was, but it is also a different style. I wouldnt want to be caught without this CD in my collection."
3,fall off,"yup, compared to older albums, this album is nothing. some songs r good like: Made u look and I know i canrest r felling down.If u want realy nas try THE LOST TAPES"
4,meh,"This album is not bad...but it's not the greatest either. It would be a shame to compare it to Illmatic, but Nasty NaS has some good work here like The Cross, which was produced by Eminem or Hay Nas, in which he tells about past relationships. If you are a NaS fan go get this album :|"
5,Jay-z stans/Nas haters need to stop posting comments..,"Straight like that..hiphop is back!..it's been back since Nas released the Qb's finest album of underground hard core rap..but now within a year he released 3 full length albums..Stillmatic, Lost Tapes and finally the cream of the crop God's Son...Honestly theres not much to say except..it's a classic his 3rd in a row and he has solidified his position as the greatest rapper of all time...He has raised the bar again, setting a standard that artist cannot reach...It's time to give it up..He's the best bar none...he's had the album of the year for 2 years straight now...c'mon..he's got verses better than rappers albums...Nas is crazy...street knowledge, book knowledge, sincerity, honesty, passion etc...he does it all.."
2,NaS bombs dis one,"Unfortuantly nas bombs this one compared to his last cd stillmatic, which was crazy. hopefully his new album Street's Disciple is alot better."
2,Not the ISBN number I requested.,This book arrived and was not the ISBN number I had requested. I even sent a message to seller to make sure it was the same because of it being a text book. I did not return it because it would have cost more than it was worth. Next time I will not pay for a book until I receive confirmations. Learning by my mistakes.
4,CHARLIE BROWN VINTAGE REELS,Purchased for my son-in-law who is a storyboard artist for Pixar and especially enjoys Charlie Brown. It arrived on time and in pristine condition. He got a kick out of his ViewMaster and vintage reels. Thank you.
5,My daughter loves these books,"This is one of many of this series that we have, & my 2 y/o lovoes all of them!"
1,"Review of the Kindle edition, not the novel itself","This review refers to the Kindle edition of the In Death titles distributed by Hachette Digital for non-US residents. The Kindle edition of this particular book and the other books in the series is not very readable -- it has been formatted with too much leading in between paragraph, forming ""rivers"" of white space that are very distracting. You can only read a few paragraphs per page and have to flip frequently (even for the average reading speed). I would've expected more attention to text formatting like some other excellent Kindle books but was quite disappointed. I love this series and was ecstatic to recollect the titles in Kindle format but am put off by the prospect of having to read future titles in the series in the same lousy text formatting."
1,Formating Disaster,"This is only a review for the Kindle edition. I wish I could actually review the CONTENT of the book, but Berkley did such a poor job with the formatting that the book is unreadable. There is a space between EVERY paragraph. This makes it impossible to tell when you switch POV or scene. I demanded my money back. I you want to charge me FRONT LIST prices for ancient books, you need to deliver a quality product."
2,"Good characters, not good writing","If you hate Conservatives and everything they stand for and want to read a book where the author shares the same opinions, (even though it is supposed to be a novel about a woman cop in the future) then this is the book for you! Robb's overzealous rip of all things conservative was so annoying that I painfully made it through this book and will never read another book of hers again. I ACTUALLY believe I would feel the same way if it were against Liberalism as well! I thought the character development was fantastic - but Robb's underlying feelings just never went away throughout the book. Also, her use of the F-word - although I don't mind sometimes, was a bit much. I can't believe that in the future when every other thing has been ""fixed"" in the mind of Robb - they haven't found other language to use...like ""frak"" (for the Battlestar Galactica fans). Ha! Enjoy it if you must - but beware of author's partial writing!"
1,Disapointed!!,"I am half way through this book. And I love the thought of the book and the series but HIGHLY disappointed that its set in the future!! I was reading and it would say something about a year like 2046 and I was so confused! But on the other hand I did not know before I started reading that it was based in the future and this ""off planet"" mess. I thought it would be like James Pattersons WMC but I was completely wrong! More power to the people that like these sorta books but I was not expecting it to be this way!"
1,1.5 stars .. Fell asleep a few times reading...,"So I was browsing for suspense/mystery/thriller/romance novels and came across this series, seems to be the right fit for what I was looking for and I thought, hmmm...maybe they are good since there are so many out already and NY best selling and all. Well, DO NOT believe the hype. I was absolutely wrong. I had to force myself to finish reading the damn book! It doesn't get thrilling until the last 50 pages! Even that part wasn't even that great. I regret purchasing this book, thank god I only bought the first one. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!"
5,A series worth exploring...,"I was skeptical about starting this series, but after the raves that several people I know gave it, I decided to see for myself. If you like romance books with a great plot (and no I am not talking about Harlequin romance books) or detective/murder mysteries you will definitely like the Death series. The book has the pace of an intriguing murder mystery with a great romance intertwined. I have already read several of the next books in the series and they definitely do not disappoint!"
4,Well created world,"In the start of this series Robb depicts the New york of the future, where only rich people can drink real coffe, robots serve take care of household chores, cars fly and weapons are banned except for collectors...and a ruthless killer.Lieutenant Eve Dallas is in charge of finding the responsible for a series of murders of prositutes. It gets more complicated when she falls for Roarke, a millionaire and one of the main suspects in the investigation. If you enjoyed immersing yourself in fantasy universes like the one in Lord of the Rings and you like mysteries this is a must read series for you!"
5,Good book.,I have read multiple books from this author and like most of them. This one especially. Highly recommended if you like this genre.
5,NAKED IN DEATH,"Just got acquainted with JD Robb books and her great character, Eve Dallas. They are terrific! Then, had to get the first one. It is as good as the latest. It is so dramatic, interesting and detailed. Set in the future, it is a taste of Scifi with a main course of plain old detective work from any century.Now I am hooked and look forward to all the others.I recommend Naked In Death and all Robb novels........"
3,I have enjoyed..,"All of the Eve Dallas series I have read. None tax the brain, but have all been entertaining and enjoyable reads. I couldn't tell you anything specific about the books, because they all seem to run together, but I can tell you I like them and I really like her characters. Definitely worth the read."
4,Go-to series,This is my go-to series - always a good read. Dallas is kick@$$ and books are very entertaining. No superhuman abilities here and a tough life has only made her tougher. Not good for kids but character has good ethics.
3,A slow series start,"Not much sex or emotion as I expect from this author.Maybe it picks up in the series.Her recent book, The Witness by Nora Roberts is HOT!!!was my first read from this author"
3,A bit confusing at first.....but keep reading.....you WONT be disappointed,"I heard so much about the In Death series by J.D Robb, so i figured I should read the first to see what it is all about. I have to say...the whole future thing really threw me off. I like Eve as a character, her backround was so sad, and the book was slightly disturbing but all in all I liked it.Roarke is a very sexy hero, or suspect...however you want to say, as he is one of the main suspects in the murder investigation. I liked the slow building relationship between Eve and Roarke, I might even read the next one just to see where it might go."
3,GOOD BUT DISTURBING---,"Saturated with sexual child abuse and somewhat graphic crime scenes, this story was hard to take at times but was still well-written and contained enjoyable characters. The villain was obvious early on and the Jetsons-like setting took a while to get used to. Audible narrator was quite good. All-in-all, don't know if I would want to experience it again."
5,Naked in Death-Another Killer from J.D. Robb,"Nora, aka J.D. knows how to keep you riveted to your seat while you read the latest adventures of Eve Dallas. I started in the middle of the series but have now gone back to the first book and am working my way through."
5,Can't get enough of the In Death books,"Can't get enough of the In Death books they keep you wanting more, and when you read the each book you can wait for the next one to come out"
5,Oh why did I wait.....,I was told that this was a romance/mystery/thriller set in the future-as I have never been hot to read those particular combinations together I waited. Even when I heard that Nora Roberts is JD. Then with nothing laying about to read I picked this up-and NEVER put it down. I think about what will happen with Eve and Roarke next....Just ordered the entire rest of the series...
3,Naked in death,"This is the first detective book from the Eve Dallas series. When I started this book I didn't know the story takes place in the future. A detective story in the future has positive and a negative sides. For some parts I thought: that's interesting, maybe it will work that way in the future. For the negative side, sometimes the new technology isn't described that well. Furthermore I couldn't really find a reason why this story must be told in the future. Maybe because they can't commit these ""old fashioned"" murders in the present time? 3 stars."
2,"Okay, nothing exciting","JD Robb is exactly like Tami Hoag (except for Ashes to Ashes, as that was a great book!). I was after a light read after a few heavy crime novels and JD Robb's novel hit the spot. Unfortunately, now I remember why I got into great crime novels..to get away from the romantic suspense novels, that are basically Mills &Boon with a bit of crime thrown in to fill up the pages.I was able to read Naked In Death in a few hours, the plot is ok, nothing exciting but really, a billionaire that is still avaliable goes after a interesting looking cop, she has an affair with him & her superior doesn't really mind..ok.A bit of realism wouldn't go astray, but then again, this is really just a bit of fluff to fill my Saturday lunchtime at work.I don't think that I will be getting another JD Robb book again unless I was completely bored and the library burnt down."
3,"great story,bad price","Putnam has set the price for older books in this series way too high. There is no printing,paper,art work, marketing or distribution cost, Amazon does it all for them. If fans want to put series on Kindle for convience they are gouged by their favorite authors publisher once again. I understand when newer books in series are offered the same price 7.99 for the kindle & paperback, I don't think it's right;but I do understand. I have the original books as they came out at home, so I will fill in at used book stores for vacation home rather than ordering at this price for my Kindle which I love and carry in purse always. So Thank you Amazon and forget you Putnam. Pat O'Brien"
4,Naked in Death,"I liked this book. It held my interest so much that I literally didn't put it down until I finished it in one long sitting. Even though I figured out who the murderer was fairly early on, there were enough twists and turns to make me reconsider a number of times before I got to the end. I will definitely continue on with the series and look forward to learning more about the mysterious Roarke."
1,Lib alert; be forewarned about author!,"This is one of those books, that is fairly enjoyable, and then when the climax comes you realize this is just a way for the author to cram down his political correctness and anti-whitey propaganda down your throat.Another weakness is that the male protagonist is wealthy beyond belief, incredibly attractive, incredibly tall and lithe, and incredibly sensitive and intelligent. Think 'female victorian pseudo porn' with an lefty world view.I will skip JD Robb's other books."
1,Are we all talking about the same book?,"I could only get through 10 pages and had to put this book down. Does every book nowadays have to be the lowest common denominator in sexual projections. In 10 pages I noted that the book was antigun, pro homosexual,and anti high moral standards. I hate it when obvious political ideaologies get stuffed down the readers throats. Don't waste your time!"
1,Awful,"I asked a friend for recommendations for a mindless beach read, and she suggested this series. I've suddenly lost a lot of respect for her. It goes beyond being a bad book, into downright offesive. What woman behaves this way? It seems assembled from off the shelf parts, by men sitting around a conference table, asking each other what women want."
2,"Good premise, but that's it","A cop in 2058 New York? Bring on the gadgets! Eve Dallas is a good character, and if Ms. Roberts wasn't a romance novelist this could have been a heck of a series. But since she is, she brings in Roarke, the mysterious Daniel Day-Lewis clone Irish billionaire (yeah, I bet New York street cops run into them EVERY day), who proceeds to promptly destroy any credibility Ms. Roberts had going with the story. As much as I hate to admit it, I've read every book in the series (before I gave up reading romance and ""romantic suspense"" in disgust). All you'll get is futuristic gadgetry combined with mundane murders and pedestrian sex scenes. Hey, Nora, just a bit of advice--even the most in-love couples don't have mind-blowing sex every time. Bottom line--Nora Roberts fans will and do adore this series, others beware!"
4,"Oh no, not another series I love!","I knew I'd love this book because I pretty much love anything written by Nora Roberts (aka JD Robb) but this surprised me. Science Fiction, romance, mystery -- well, those are my favorite genres by one of my favorite authors. Now, I just have to figure out how I can afford ALL the others!"
4,Misleading title,"I liked the story and I like the lead character. I didn't get the whole ""in the future deal""......I mean I get it but I don't understand the importance. The story could have happened today. The futuristic part almost seemed like an after thought it mattered so little."
4,Great story,Wonderful plot. Love the interaction between Roake and Eve. Can not wait to read more of The Death series and how they both evolved.
5,The One That Started it all !!.,"After reading reviews I decided to buy and was not disappointed. I am not a pro reviewer. I have no fancy words to describe this book only to say that it is exciting, interesting, grabs your imagination and doesn't let go till the last page is read. Thanks to all who recommended this!!!"
4,Good to start at the beginning,"I started reading the Eve Dallas novels about 4 books into the series, and was hooked right away. Just had to find out how it all started and Naked in Death is the debut novel for the series. It's classic JD Robb aka Nora Roberts - with a great plot that develops well, the characters are real (despite the futuristic period setting, which provides an interesting foil for Eve's turmoil and angst) It's good to start with this book first, because JD Robb really fleshes out the characters and creates more intense plots subsequently in the series. Even if you've read her later books, Naked In Death makes for excellent reading and provides you with the background to Eve and Roarke's relationship."
5,Naked in Death,"i really enjoyed the book and have read the whole series again,captured my imagination to what the future could be"
4,Good Series JD Robb,JD Robb series - have read newer ones and trying to pick up the whole series.Enjoy the mental calculations for solving the crimes.
4,"Finally, the beginning~","I felt some closure upon reading ""the beginning"" of the Eve Dallas saga! I am a big fan of the audio book as I spend a great deal of time on the road in 1/2 hour to hour spurts. I started with the print versions but really enjoy the audio. This cd did not have the characters/voices developed as the future ones did but that could be expected. I always felt something missing by not knowing where Nora Roberts/JD Robb initiated the lives of her characters. I am comfortable with that now and will continue to listen to all the cds as they continue!"
5,This series is fabulous!,"This is the book that introduces Eve Dallas, the Lieutenant on whom this series focuses. She is a homicide detective, and keeps finding all these naked dead people (hence the name). Through the book, you are introduced to several of the key players in this series, and it sets the tone for others. The setting is the future, and Eve has all kinds of neat computers and technology at her reach. Of course, the human element is still always needed.Eve is very human, and through the series we see her dealing with some serious personal issues, making friends, learning to trust, etc.I love this series and feel that it is the best that Nora Roberts has ever written! :)"
5,Great Book,This book is one of the first ones she wrote. Very good- I loved it! And again I passed it on to one of my coworkers that is reading JD Robb as well.
5,Excellent series,This is the first book that introduces you to the slightly futuristic world of Eve Dallas - NYPSD (NYPD to us) homocide detective. Each book is a new case and *every* single book is fantastic! This purchase was actually to introduce my cousin to the series :-)
3,Like my science fiction more - science fictiony.?.,"i enjoyed Naked in death. In terms of what it promises and delivers there is very good congruence. The characters were stereotypical and the plot predictable, but then again I wasn't looking for a challenging read. The one thing I don't understand is why the book is set in a 'science fiction' future that isn't really that much of science fiction? There was not any new technology introduced to solve the case, really, and the science fiction part felt gimmicky, as if the author isn't aware of what the genre really should offer. Instead of contributing to the plot, characters or storytelling, the clumsy attempts to incorporate the science fiction distracted from the writing."
5,Wow...am I glad I found these....,"I just finished my first J.D. Robb (Nora Roberts) book and am I hooked. I read it in two days time and tripped over myself to get the next one in the series. What more could a girl want; suspense, romance, sex and Roarke? Read this one!!!"
5,Great beginning to an awesome series!,Enjoy the very beginnings of Roarke and Eve's romance and the world of 2059. I LOVE this series but will admit it's not for everyone...but there are A LOT of us out here!!! Do yourself a favor and begin at the beginning.
4,GREAT! COULDN'T PUT DOWN,"I'M NORMALLY A ROBERT'S FAN FOR ALL HER ROMANCES & WAS SO THRILLED BY HER BOOKS WHEN I SAW A LISTING FR JD ROBB I WENT OUT & GRABBED THE FIRST BOOK IN THE EVE DALLAS SERIES. IT WAS GREAT COULDN'T WAIT FOR GLORY IN DEATH. DEFINETLY A GREAT FIND & IT WAS WORTH READING IF NOT ONCE THEN OVER AGAIN & AGAIN. I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO READING THE OTERS IN THE SERIES & AS WITH ALL HER OTHER BOOKS, THEY WLL BE SUPERB AS WELL!!!"
2,What about inflation???,"I could complain about the stereotypical junk in this book. The ""tough as nails"" cop that ""truly cares"", vacillating between steely eyed stares and crying ""oh the humanity"" at the violence she sees. And I could go on and on about how every man in the book is either a complete evil jerk except for two: Her assistant, who is ok because he does whatever she tells him to, and mister perfect, the billionaire who chases her around like a lost puppy.But let's move on to why I'm really writing. The money. At one point in the story it's a big deal that a guy spent $25,000 four times to shell out $100,000. That's a lot of money!In 1995.But the story takes place in 2058. Assuming 4% inflation per year that's about $2100 a time. Not really the ""smoking gun"" the characters make it sound like. This changes it from ""that's more money than he makes in a year!"" to ""that's enough money to buy a decent used car!"""
2,Couldn't get past what plagued the main character...,"The book started off ok but then the reader discovers that Eve, the main character, is plagued by a very violent crime involving a little girl. Without giving too much away, I just found myself as a reader having a hard time getting past this point. It seems to me that the crime involving this child was ultra violent and something that did not need to be fictionalized for a book. Nora Roberts is a creative person who could have come up with a myriad of crimes that could have been just as effective in terms of a catalyst for a novel and a main character."
3,very different,"from the nora roberts i love. because of all the hype surrounding this book by all those i know that read and love nora roberts, i was expecting something wonderful, but didnt really find it. the story itself is good, but i found myself confused at times as to what was going on and why things were included. eve is a spunky cop with a major attitude. roarke is a well to do who seems far out of eves league, but thru the magic of writting, they end up together trying to solve this case. i will more than likely read the following books in this series because i have them, but if i only had this one in my to be read pile, i doubt i would pick up the next in the series."
5,A futuristic fun read,With so many reviews already written on this book it seems little is left to say except that from my viewpoint it was a delightful read. My first In Death book was given to me in 2011 and started in the middle of the series. I was intrigued enough in the how and why of Dallas and Roarke's meeting to go back and start at the beginning. And because with all of the interaction between so many of the main characters it's fun to find out how the relationships began and why they continue to evolve. I've already picked up the next several books in the series and am certain I will find them as enjoyable as the first. Great job of writing J. D. Robb.
4,Good book,This one was sad how the people where treated but it also was really good the supence. I never would have guessed the ending.
3,Naked in Death,I found this book to be interesting to read but the characters were somewhat boring. It was not thrilling enough for me.
4,another great novel by JD Robb,"the protagonist in JD Robb's death series is someone you'd like to know. intriguing stories. always keeps your interest. Although each plot deals with death, each is variable and unique in many ways."
2,Too much graphic sex for me,"This was an ok book. Not one that I would ever reread or one that makes me want to read the next one in the series. It could have interested me except for two things. One: there's lots of graphic sex and a description of sexual child abuse that I found very disturbing. Two: the writer has an agenda. The bad guys are ""Conservatives"" who want to give everyone guns, stop prostitution, and take everyone back to the horrible 21st century by forcing their ""morality"" on everyone. This was repeated over and over again in the book. Eve keeps going on and on about how horrible it was when everyone had guns, and people were shot by guns, and how violent guns are, and how much better everything is now that no one is allowed to have a gun. Oddly enough, she is a homicide cop whose last case was a horrific child murder done with a knife. But knives are okay. Hacking someone into pieces is much less violent then those horrible guns!"
3,Reality Break,"As a person who likes to reward himself with a good fiction read (mind candy) after every non fiction book, Robb provided just what the doctor ordered. Robb mixed in the right amount of futuristic gadgetry, plot twist and sensual sauce to ensure her murder mystery held the reader's attention from beginning to end. This was my first read by J.D. Robb (Pen Name) and I'm already selecting my next title."
4,A great book to start off a series.,"In this, the first book of the ""In Death"" series set in the 2050s, you are introduced to Eve Dallas. Eve is a cop of ten years, and is dedicated to her job. All of her energy goes into hleping people who are murdered, and finding their killers. Eve is driven to do the best that she can by a past that she cannot remeber.While investigating the murder of several licensed companions she is introduced to Roarke who, though a suspect, intreges and intrests her. As Eve fights these new fealing the murderer continues to kill his chosen victims. Can she solve the case before even more loose their lives, or handle the memories of her past that the case awakens in her?"
3,Slow Start,"this book started off slow, but as I got past the middle of the book I started getting into it a lot more. I liked how Robb brought a little romance into the story. the book was hard to put down towards the end. If you like mystery, suspence and romance.. you will like this book. Just don't expect it to start out with a bang."
5,Naked in Death,"An edgy, fast paced, yet insightful novel, providing murder, police drama and romance in a futuristic setting. New York detective Eve Dallas is assigned to the murder of a high class hooker with ties to a prominent family. The investigation leads her through twists and turns and she becomes involved with Roarke, one of her suspects, making her question herself and begin to come to terms with her own mysterious past.A gripping lead in to the series."
2,Slow and Predictable,"I guess I'm going against the grain though I feel like I'm being generous with a two-star rating. Based on the other ratings I was expecting a lot more. Why two-stars? The story was incredibly predictable. I like at least a couple of twists and turns, and was hoping for a surprise ending, and..... nothing. The story was slow, way too much time on an incredibly predictable love story, (gee - tough, poor good-girl cop with a history gets incredibly wealthy, elusive, handsome guy who just can't seem to resist her - who woulda thought?!), unrealistic conversations, and not in a good fiction book way, the person who you think is the bad guy turns out to be, oh, the bad guy, too little action. I regretted the time I spent reading it and not just putting it down and instead waiting for at least a good ending. Sorry J.D., my first and only ever read of one of your books."
4,Great Way to Start a Mystery Series,"Naked in Death is the first book in a 34 book series (so far) by Nora Roberts (writing under the name ""J.D. Robb""). The series is about a police officer named Eve Dallas. She is a homicide detective, she takes her work very seriously. She has a tragic past.This book concerns a case of three women who were murdered and Eve's work to find the killer and bring them to justice. As in every good mystery there are twists, turns and surprises along the way. She is romanced during this investigation by 'Roarke' a mysterious wealthy man who may or may not have something to do with her case.I was engrossed with this book while reading it. The characters were interesting and complex, the plot was realistic, and the way the story unfolded was entertaining to the reader. I would recommend this book to those who enjoy mysteries and contemporary action with moments of chilling surprise. This book does have adult themes, not for most under 18."
1,Disappointing,"I really wanted to like this book, but I just couldn't get past the first few chapters. The characters are unbelievable, the plot is unrealistic, and it's very sexist. I don't recommend it."
2,Not so good!,"This book seemed to have the elements of a good story but it just never came together. One of the basic premises of the story is that the burglar's sister, who is the embodiment of everything good, beautiful and brave (!), does not realize that she lives in a shanty in the woods yet has possessions like the stolen sable coat and never even suspects that something about these very valuable items and her brother's acquisition of them is suspicious. The supposed instant love between Geoffrey and Cecilia did not ring true at all nor did McVay's behavior induce me to believe that he would get away from punishment for his crimes. The ending was also very unsatisfactory and unbelievable. Overall, I didn't like this story and would not recommend it to anyone else."
2,"Keeps you reading, but disappointing","This book kept me reading to the end, but I am disappointed. I am disappointed with this book because in my opinion, the burglar does not get what he deserves for his crimes. Even if the ""head and heart"" of the main character didn't agree, he should have done the right thing by letting true justice prevail."
2,Inexpensive but cheap looking not to be offered as gifts!,A ball is supposed to be a sphere but these are not. Yes they are colorful and have nice designs but the fact they are shaped irregular cheapen them.
3,beach ball party,thought I was getting variety with the size of the balls. The balls were all very small. Still liked my purchase and was happy with it.
2,Not as pictured,"I ordered these as part of a party favor for my child's birthday. I was expecting them to look like the ones in the picture but half of them are cheesy looking with random generic animals on them (that aren't represented in the picture). These aren't as cute as the ones in the picture by far. Also, we didn't get a single smiley face ball. I blew up a couple and the size is consistent with the stated size. I'm just disappointed I didn't receive what I expected to from the picture."
2,Didn't Work,"I ordered these balls as a party favor for my 2 year old's birthday party. I opened one and tried it when I received them I was very disappointed.First, I believe 5"" is the length of the ball when elongated and deflated. When inflated, they're just smaller than the size of an adult fist. I was unhappy with the size, but I would have still used them if they worked.The real problem and the reason I rated them 2 stars was that they don't stay inflated. Because they're so small, it's impossible to inflate them and get it closed before all of the air escapes. If you do manage to get your finger over the hole and get it closed, a little squeeze on the ball made the valve pop open again 75% of the time.Over all, I returned them because they just didn't work for me."
5,A Good Bargain and Excellent Customer Service,"The small beach balls were very popular w/my daughter's lake swim team. Even though a few of the balls were defective, their customer service dept. responded promptly and appropriately. I will certainly be recommending you to my friends and acquaintances. Thanks!"
1,Deceiving photo!,"The 25 balls I received looked nothing like what's in the photo. Most of them are white and blue or white and red stripes! Much simpler than even the regular rainbow colored beach balls i can buy anywhere. I thought I was getting something more fun, but ended up with less. Very disappointed. Amazon needs to update their product photo!"
5,Good Party Favor!,This is a great idea for party favors. These mini beach balls are pretty durable. Very fun for little kids or adults! They make parties in general a lot of fun.
4,WELL WORTH READING,"THIS BOOK GIVES A VERY NOSTALGIC AND DETAILED LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF SHIBE PARK AND THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOOD. MUCH DETAIL AND DRAMA IS GIVEN TO THE EVENTS THAT GRACED THIS GREAT PARK. ALSO COVERED IN DETAIL ARE THE SHORT STAY OF THE EAGLES, THE RIVALTY OF THE A'S AND PHILLIES. THE BUNGLING AND MISMANEGMENT OF THE MACK FAMILY AND OF THE CARPENTERS IS ALSO VERY WELL DOCUMENTED AND WELL DESCRIBED. THE TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM SURROUNDING THE JOUNEY TO AND FROM SHIBE PARK AND THE DETERIORATING NEIGHBORHOOD ARE ALSO A VERY WELL COVERED PART OF THIS MUST READ NOVEL. I REALLY LOVED THIS BOOK. I HAVE NEVER BEEN TO PHILADELPHIA, BUT THE AUTHOR MAKES THIS HISTORIC PARK INTO A STAPLE IN BASEBALL HISTORY. VERY RECOMMENDED."
3,We're on a Road to Nowhere...,"Road Trip is one of those movies that you really hope will be good, but wind up disappointed in at the end. There are about two or three bust-a-gut funny scenes, but they are not enough to redeem the rest of the movie. The actors are engaging, but they just don't have the material they need to work with. If you're in the mood for some mildly amusing college antics, rent this; otherwise save your time and money"
3,Road trip to somewhere,"I thought this move would be as stupid as American Pie. However I was wrong. I was laughing so hard. I saw the unrated version to see if it would be different then the rated version. (...) Come on give me a break! The story line and the comedy scenes were funny though. We could have done without the nude women, all the time. I would buy this movie anyway."
3,Laughs,"Good humor, not OVERLY HILARIOUS but funny. Sorry, but Tom Green is as usual over rated. The skinny guy DJ Qualls steals the shows best parts with his dancing and ""finaly got some"" scenes."
3,Suprisingly Funny,"I hate Tom Green. Let's get that established right away. But, suprisingly I enjoyed this movie. There was a lot of humor and a lot of grossness. It portrayed typical college dudes. A lot of new faces in this film and some old, but not seasoned ones. This movie is in the same category as films like Animal House and the new one, ""Dude, Where's my car?"" Although it doesn't live up to the standard that Animal House does, ""Road Trip"" is still funny and entertaing. Even for people that have never experienced a ""Road Trip""."
5,too funny,I like watching Road Trip too much.... it is full of laughs. I like the part when they go to the University of Tennessee and Kial meets his first love. This is a great teen movie. A must see.
4,"Good, funny, stupid brain candy of a film","Anyone who's expecting ""The Shawshank Redemption"" or ""The Cider House Rules"" will be deeply disappointed with this film. But if you're looking for some mindless brain candy to take your mind off things, this film won't let you down. Tom Green's character got on my nerves (an acquired taste, to be sure), but I found myself enjoying the other characters and their escapade from Ithaca to Houston. In fact, I almost wanted it to go on a little bit longer, because they seemed to get back to Ithaca a little too quickly. But brain candy aside, the central characters actually do each evolve in the course of this flick. While this was never an Oscar contender, it's good for a few laughs. Anyone who's ever been in college, challenged his/her parents, been off on an adventure, raced the clock, will find something here with which they can relate. Throw your pretenses to the wind and just enjoy it. It IS funny."
4,Road Trip,"This movie was really funny. I gave it 4 stars because the comedy kind of dies off. This is a great movie for young, horny guys because if you can get away with watching it then you better be ready for a lot of nudity. The funniest parts are when a fat guys has some fun with french toast, when a guy gets some 'help' at a sperm donor clinic, and when a guy steals a bus from a blind lady. Overall this is a gross and funny movie but if you're offended by naked women and things like that you should stray away from this movie."
2,average raunch comedy,"""Road Trip"" is just yr average teen raunch comedy (in addition to being one of thousands that stuck their fingers in the American Pie) and while certain parts of the movie are enough to inspire a grin or a chuckle, the movie's points are scored by the posters in Breckin Meyer's room: Archers of Loaf, Swans, Superchunk, etc etc etc...but perhaps this was just used to up the hip factor.Save your $$ and buy albums by any of these three bands!"
2,Incredibly disappointing...,"I was expecting a laugh-riot the likes of ""American Pie."" Instead what I got was a cheap imitation and another annoying performance by Tom Green. While I'm thankful that he's barely in the movie (Green can't act and isn't funny anyway), he's still in it, meaning he's still annoying. Breckin Meyer and Seann William Scott are the only reasons to see this movie. While true, Scott's character in this is a carbon copy of his Stifler character in the funnier ""American Pie"" films, it still works here. There are a few good belly laughs in this movie, but overall it is a forgettable experience and just a ho-hum movie. The unrated version really doesn't enhance the movie at all. Actually, any differences between the R-rated and Unrated go completely unnoticed, proving that unrated versions are 90% of the time entirely useless."
5,Tell that b***h to make me some Blu Ray Pancakes! LOL,Will this be out on Blu Ray? For some reason this movie has always been my favorite movie of all time. I have watched it hundreds of times and it is still funny to me. I was wondering if anyone knows if this will be out on Blu Ray? I really want to see it in high quality.
5,Road Trip Movie,This movie is absolutely hilarious. I watched it three times the first day I got it and endless times after that. It will have you laughing hysterically! Definitely worth the money!
1,Am I The Only One Who Hates This Movie ???,"Yes, I liked American Pie and I loved American Pie 2, but Road Trip is only a rip-off. Seann William Scott is a great, funny actor full of energy, but he can't save this garbage. The only bad actor in this movie is Tom Green. Yes, I admit the story looks like fun, but it isn't. There are 2 funny scenes: The scene at the bridge and the scene with the blind woman and that's it. Pure garbage and a waste of time and money. The best comedy ever is still 10 Things I Hate About You!"
1,Want to watch a STUPID movie?,"This one's for you if you're into stupidity. There was nothing funny about it. Ok, perhaps one or two scenes were funny. This DID NOT have me rolling in my seat begging for more. A good movie for teenage boys, not to insult teenage boys by any means. Definitely not for an intelligent adult."
1,This movie is for people who like to &#65533;Milk The Prostate&#65533;,"I like ""Road"" movies. Thus I was looking forward to watching this movie. What I don't like however, are movies that try to be funny, but fail, miserably, in their objective.What I dislike even more are false claims. This movie, by having the audacity to call itself ""Road Trip"", is claiming to be the `Daddy' of all road movies. But, not only doesn't it better the classic road movies, it fails to even equal the most mediocre of road movies.This movie only deserves a review because it stars the legendary Tom Green (star, writer, director of the 5-Star movie ""Freddy Got Fingered""), and because it does have one funny scene it - the ""Milking The Prostate"" scene.Get your rubber gloves out."
1,another reason to hate MTV,"A ninth-rate attempt at a film about the great college tradition. Cannot compare to PCU, Revenge of the Nerds, Back to School, Real Genius, ANIMAL HOUSE, many others. This movie has nothing original, and Tom Green's role could have been much funnier. MTV films seem so politically correct, and this was no exeption. If you like the Disney/McDonalds-style crap music and brainless shows MTV mass produces these days, you'll probably enjoy this horrible film that drains stupid teen-agers of their allowance money."
2,HATEABLE,"""Road Trip"" was almost as bad of a movie as ""Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind""!!! There is absolutely NOTHING funny about this tripe. This movie was crap. It is just so stupid. There's too much wasted nudity, and it tries much too hard to be funny, that it isn't."
3,Good stupid fun,"Though this isn't the best movie made, it has some funny parts. Those who like dirty humor will love ""Road Trip"". This is a movie that you don't have to think about what's happening. They reveal everything so people all ages will understand. Breckin Meyer, Tom Green, Seann William Scott, etc. are okay at their acting, nothing spectacular. Many events don't fit very well, but it's still funny.""Road Trip"" isn't anywhere close to Oscar worthy, but it's still entertaining. It can be a good lay-back movie."
5,Hilarious Movie,"""Road Trip"" is one of those movies to watch ONLY if you are in the mood for some comedy. Yes, some of it is ""gross humor"", but that is Tom Green in a nutshell. I know I have never laughed this hard except for during ""Happy Gilmore"", which still ranks as my favorite comedy. This movie, however, IS funnier than ""American Pie"", although it never received the accolades that ""American Pie"" did.Seann William Scott is a rising comedic talent, and is just hilarious in this movie as E.L. His lines and facial expressions are just great. ""What am I going to do...stay here and learn?"" is one of my favorite lines.D.J. Qualls is also quite funny as the skinny white boy with the orange Atari shirt. Lastly, Amy Smart is a cutie-pie playing the role of Beth. Watch this movie...you won't regret it!"
4,Enjoy it at Face Value,"... The plot of the movie is little more than trying to get an incriminating videotape before it arrives at Brecken Myers' girlfriend's dorm, so the gang heads from Ithaca to Austin to get it. But along the way, a script peppered with some witty dialogue (yes, ""witty""), some memorable visual gags, and likeable characters manages to keep you captivated. The unrated DVD features several scenes of nude women, which don't appear in the theatrical release. The behind the scenes featurette really isn't anything more than a look at the actors and crew goofing off, and the DVD-ROM game is pretty easy, so the special features here are somewhat lacking. But if you're just looking for something to chill out with, and to get a few cheap laughs from, this movie is worth it. If you're looking for the meaning of life, you won't find it here. (Maybe, ""Dude, Where's My Car?"")"
4,Road Trip (Dvd Edition),"Excellent movie: all actors plays an incredible succesfull game, you don't sytop laughing dureing all the movie but it also makes you follow the entire movie."
3,Just for Fun,"This is one of those movies that is just fun to watch. It has a lot of the teen/young adult typical situations, but with some new and funny twists. And yes, it answers that question for everyone (warning: possible spoiler): girls stand around topless because a guy is telling the story.The extras on this dvd are minimal, but fun. There are some deleted scenes, and ""behind the scenes"" mini-documentary. This movie is *not* appropriate for children."
3,"Funny, but still not better than ""American Pie""","I have watched both movies, and although I found ""Road Trip"" funny it never made me laugh until it hurt as ""American Pie"" did more than once. Also, Tom Greene's performance is totally secondary. In fact, I didn't like it too much. Check out this flick, though, if you feel like kicking back and watching something that will cheer you up and you will not be forced to think through at all."
5,Unrated and better!,"I have read so many reviews that say that there is nothing different between the rated and unrated versions of ""road trip,"" but they are all wrong. I have checked both versions and it appears that some footage was cut from the scene where the women are in the locker room. Obviously cut in order to make this film acceptable for the R rating."
3,"Definitely a ""guy"" movie","Yes there is a lot of gratuitous nudity - that is why it is a guy movie. But that is also what makes it funny. A guy is telling the story so of course he is going to add as much nudity as possible! Speaking of Tom Green though...I really think we could have done without his part all together. His character added nothing to the movie....and he is not even that funny. (though I must admit, the snake biting his hand made me laugh harder than anything else in the movie) Watching the scenes with the hotel clerk, my husband and I kept saying ""Who is that? I know that guy"" But we just could not figure out who it was! That was truly inspired casting. Andy Dick IS unrecognizable and hilarious. :) Don't feel left out though girls...you will enjoy this movie too. Breckin Meyer is a cutie and the other guys are not too bad either. :) Even the skinny kid!! :)"
5,I agree with Jason Greeno,"DON'T let the ""Un-Rated"" bit fool you. I did'nt notice any difference to the theatrical version except of course the interactive DVD menu with deleted scenes and a behind the scenes with Tom Green bit. I ordered this DVD because I loved the movie, and because I love Tom Green. It takes something extremely funny to make me laugh when watching TV, or a movie. When I went to see it in the theatre, my gut hurt from laughing so hard. When I got the DVD, I laughed just as hard watching it the 2nd time. OWN IT!!"
3,"Go For It, Man!","I'm a big fan of American Pie. I decided to rent Road Trip and was pleasantly surprised that it had some funny scenes. Even ""old people"" (people over the age of 17 :-) ) can find some humor in it. I suggest you rent it when your brain doesn't want to think too much and you have some leftover popcorn to eat."
2,"Subpar, to say the least","Going into this, I thought I would like this movie. I figured it would tread the same line as the American Pie movies. I found it, however, very disappointing. I've never been a fan of Tom Green. His patent ""Confused stare"" is stomach churning. An accidental genious, if you will, and I am glad America has woken up from their hypnotized state that he had over them. All the other characters are unlikeable. The pot head kid is an arrogant, self-serving, character that is too smart for his own good. DJ Qualls is too whiny in the beginning and then is too full of himself at the end. Sean William Scott tries but fails to save this movie by delivering a second-rate Stifler. The ending feels too much like a cop out. Breckin Meyer gets saved because of Tom Green's stupidity. If only Tom Green would have taped over Paris Hilton's tape. A better ending would have been if his girlfriend beat him to a bloody mess."
5,MUST OWN,"I don't know what it is about the college comedies that keep me buying the DVD's but this movie is the bomb! I guess it is just a reminder of all the things I did and or wish I did back in school. Although the movie has a relativly young cast, their is still excellant experience from Breckin and Seann to make this movie rock. The combination of all cast members makes this as classic as Animal House. You must own it!"
5,This movie is really really good,"Ok this movie is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. If u liked American Pie I guarantee u, that u will like this movie. I'm 14 and my friend and I went to see this movie not sure what to expect, we came out of the theatre asking when it would be out on video so we could watch it again again. If your in the mood for a laugh out loud comedy, buy this movie."
3,EUROTRIP IS MUCH BETTER,"The best thing that makes this movie deserve just 3 stars is some of the music. This movie is barely a gag, and it is OKAY, but some of the songs played is what I like best about it. The song by the Eels and that ""I WANNA ROCK"" song, especially!!"
3,Reasonably funny & entertaining...,"Although the humor is mostly sophmoric, I found the movie fairly enjoyable to watch. Tom Green is certainly the funniest part of the movie, but he is only in about half of the scenes. The four guys on the road trip are completely boring, except for the various misadventures of the ""skinny"" kid and the ""milking"" scene with the nurse. If you watch the movie with realistic expectations you will have a good laugh. It is a decent ""soft comedy"". It deserves 3-1/2 stars but amazon does not allow, so 3 it is."
4,Road Trip DVD,"Road Trip is a pretty good movie although it borrows HEAVILY from Overnight Delivery (stars Paul Rudd and Reese Witherspoon). If you like sophmoric type humor and American Pie then you'll probably like this movie quite a bit. Be prepared to watch a silly movie when you go into this one. If you don't like the recent comedys that have been aimed at teenagers then you may not want to watch this one. I thought Road Trip was one of the better comedys of 2000 (Better than most but not as good as Little Nicky and on par with Meet the Parents). The DVD isn't that spectacular though. The sound and picture are both good, but the special add ons frankly arent that special."
3,exactly what i wanted to see,"This movie caught me off gaurd, it was much funnier than i thought it would be. I was rolling on the floor the first time i watched it. I did watch it a second time an dit lost a lot of punch, the humor relise on thing happening that are very unexpected, (most of which are dream sequences that become predictable i.e ""oh i bet he's dreaming again"") I'm kind of upset i now own it, you may be better off renting it.All in all a great party movie, the cut parts are pretty lame, and cut for good reason, the unrated parts are mostly closeups of women's breasts...."
2,"""Unrated"" is unnecessary","I was very disappointed in this DVD. I purchased it with the idea that there would be some new footage in the unrated version that was not shown in the theatres, but I couldn't find anything that I hadn't seen before. Unlike American Pie, which had a very good unrated version, this one fails to be any different than the rated ""R"" version shown with its theatrical release. While I enjoyed the movie originally, I wouldn't have bought this DVD knowing what I do now. If you're thinking of buying this in order to find something new and interesting, please save yourself the trouble and money and don't click that button."
5,Easy to use - Even for Non-Lawyers,I'm not a lawyer and I find this book extremely useful and easy to use.It offers step by step instructions on locating specific information at each site included in the book - and there's alot of sites. It's got everything from public records and business research resources to medical and scientific sites.The index makes it easy to find info in the book and the CD makes it easy to link directly to the sites.I highly recommend this book to anyone whether they're a lawyer or not!
3,Not the MoMA Version,"I bought this DVD thinking that it was the version I'd seen at the Museum of Modern Art in NY. Not so. It's the same film, but the accompanying music in solo piano, and not the fantastic orchestral accompaniment I expected. It makes a huge difference, so I would not recommend this version."
3,biksqad,"In general, a so,so movie. Not up to my standards for my collection. Will give away to a friend. Sometimes the cover gives you the wrong opinion."
2,Only if you're a sailor,"If your passion is sailing, here is the historical work for you! Otherwise you'll find this one a hard tack to take!"
5,Underrated movie,"This movie is more like 3 1/2 stars but at the time of writing this it was at 2.5 and that's too low. I enjoy a lot of remakes since they still feel like a different movie and have different elements and a lot of the times are better. I haven't seen the Japanese version and I don't care too, I don't get a hard on over foreign films. This was pretty entertaining and kept a decent pace however and the acting was pretty good. A good story even if it was kinda predictable towards the end, worth the watch and underrated!"
3,Not much new here...,"""Shutter"" doesn't provide anything new in regard to the story we have already seen in The Grudge and The Ring. A wrongly deceased Asian girl is the focal point of this and the aforementioned films. The only difference is that this ghost doesn't have the trademark herky-jerky movements that was introduced in those 2 movies. The acting in this film is only fair. It starts off with plenty of potential, but I found myself not frightened or even rendered uncomfortable with the imagery. It doesn't take you to the edge of your seat. And you don't know whether to feel sympathetic toward the newlywed couple that is plagued by her presence, because the film feels very ""by-the-numbers"" and is completely predictable given its predecessors. If you are looking for a film that is suspenseful involving photography, check outEyes of Laura Marsor the Asian-influencedThe Messengers, which is quite eerie."
3,good horror film,I didnt watch the hole film so I want write a review about it. but from what I did watch I liked it ok. a good horror film worh buying I think
4,"Powerful Movie, Powerful Actors","I don't like horror nor watched the original. I bought it because Rachael took the time to make it. But it's really powerful, and so is my friends' opinion. I'd give it 4 stars because the flow is a little bit slow. However Joshua and Rachael deliver a superb performance."
4,Tired of Horror Movie Snobs - This Movie Wasn't That Bad!!!,"Ok, I hesitated buying this movie because of the reviews here and from what I had heard. I own the original Thai release of this movie and love it. I decided to buy this movie and I'm not sorry that I did. It is not that bad. The photography was good, the effects were good, the actors were good...the story is not original, it is borrowed...but then again so are most the stories out there. I liked the twist on the ending that this one had. Give this movie a chance and don't listen to horror movie snobs who probably only give a 5-star if peoples limbs are hanging on by a thread and there are buckets of blood and guts. If you want a good movie about a ghost haunting someone that did them wrong, then you won't be sorry with this movie."
1,"I shuddered, but for the wrong reasons.","First off, let me say that I love horror films and remakes as such, but this has to be one of the most horrific movies I have viewed recently (ironic, isn't it). The plot is uninteresting, there's too much of a gap between the ""scary"" scenes (which aren't even scary, just laughable), the casting is poor, the acting is below average, and that's just to say a few things. I'm glad that I got this as a free rental because I wouldn't have wanted to waste any money on this. It's bad enough that I wasted an hour and a half of my time watching this garbage. I kept waiting for something to happen and it never did. I wouldn't recommend this under any circumstances. They ought to be ashamed of themselves creating this because The Ring was a fantastic movie and The Grudge was a decent movie. If you want to see a movie of this type that's done well, try The Eye with Jessica Alba. I was interested the entire time and the characters were believable."
3,An OK horror film. Worth watching if your bored.,"Shutter is a generic Japanese horror flick. Nothing too special about it or stand out. It's pretty basic and somewhat predictable. The story does flip around on you so it's not so run of the mill, but I don't know what turned me off so much about this movie. It had the potential to be great, but I think the combination of the casting roles, the story balance made this picture a flop. Not to mention that there are so many ""Grudge"" & ""Ring"" ripoff movies out that this one kind of just blends in with the rest of them. I'm a big horror fan and I've seen may films from box office smashers to low budget crashers. Shutter is honestly just a copycat movie made to cash in on the dying Japanese/US horror fad. Btw that whole weight thing and always behing together was poor attempt to bring shock value to this vauge movie."
4,Not as bad as it could have been,"The original Thai film is one of my favorites in the Asian horror genre, and I admit that I expected the worst when I learned of the remake. However, the director reimagined the story just enough to engage a wider audience and add a big-budget edge, yet he retained much of the original concept. I found the acting to be pretty good, with a great performance from the lead actress. As a horror film, I give it an average rating. There are lots of jump scares, and we get to see the old ""dead girl with black hair"" trope that was introduced by Asian horror. I'd say most of the people who call this a piece of trash, or nothing compared to the original, were determined to hate it in the first place."
4,Suspense....,"I had seen this movie before but my husband hadn't, he thought it was awesome, as did I, even the second time around!"
2,"What's with the ""dead girl"" ghost thing in so many movies lately?","I am catching up on movies sitting in my collection that I bought and haven't watched while I am off for summer and it seems like I have stumbled upon a trend. Last week I finally got to ""Gothica"" and in that movie, there is a dark road, a car, and a girl standing in the middle of the road waiting to be hit. This movie, starts out about the same way. The comparisons don't stop there.The cover says to ""prepare yourself for bone chilling terror"" packed with shocking scenes not shown in theaters. I didn't see anything remotely shocking or new here. Rated PG teen movie except for maybe the main twist at the end.And how about a little truth in advertising? Bonus selections include ""a twisted alternate ending you must see to believe."" So I had to see it. It wasn't much different than the one used in the final cut.Kinda boring. Just my take."
4,"""Shutter"" is not like other horror films","It takes awhile to get into this movie but worth the wait.I was shocked at the ending,and wanted to see the film all over again to find out the clues I missed."
4,Ok.......................,"This movie only gets 3 stars from me. But 1 extra star because of cinematic photography. It is just like all the other Asian remakes. Some parts are creepy. At the end when Ben is searching for Megumi and he uses those wires stuff on his head I cringed!!! O Mi God, I just didn't want to see that happening. It's a good thing they didn't show it. Also there is little blood and language for an Unrated version.The ending was lackluster too. But glad I bought it!!! Also like I said, the cinematic photography was BEAUTIFUL. And the shots of Japan!!! Definitely eye-candy. So were the actors, plus the acting was good. (I thought)."

4,Shutter,"The movie arrived quickly, however, it is a present so it has not been watched yet. I cannot say if the quality is as good as listed."
3,shutterbuggin,"While I am the first to admit that Shutter doesn't exactly fit the bill as an original idea, it is one very effective ghost vehicle of a film. The gritty feel of the Ring and The Grudge with a bit of The Messengers thrown in for variety, Shutter effectively dismisses some of the unreal feel of Ring and Grudge while maintaining a terrific scare factor and goosebump feel of the messengers. Joshua Jackson certianly wouldn't have been my first choice as leading man material in a horror film, but here too, Joshua's portrayal is equal parts amiable and suspicious, though better writing would have peppered his performance even more. Scared wife ready to jump out of her skin scare factor notwithstanding, Shutter falls just below the radar of excellence at every turn, and yet it still manages to be a nail biter at all the opportune moments. As long as you are ok with a bigtime rehash, Shutter won't disappoint, and if you're into ghost stories, Shutter is only slightly out of focus. 3.25 stars"
3,Surprisingly Suspenseful!!,Even though this film was not as good as other remakes (such as the ring and the grudge movies) I did enjoy it quite alot. It had the same sense of dread and quite a few inventive scares provided. I really liked Australian Rachel Taylor in the film.
1,Bloody awful,"""J Horror"" as in ""junk"" which is what this mess is. Yet another hatchet job on a very intelligent shocker from Thailand but transplanted to Japan for no apparent reason other than to have stupid Americans throw themselves out of high-rise windows. They could have stayed home and done that. I could have stayed home too, except that the movie is what would have gone flying, not me.All the subtlety is gone, replaced by CGI effects that have no clear bearing on the story that, in itself, is confused at best. It's bearable if you have no demands to make on your own intelligence but otherwise stay away.Everything that the original had going for it, which was EVERYTHING, this mess lacks. I can't wait to avoid the next one."
1,Garbage,"I adore B horror, but this film doesn't come close to qualifying on that level. Obviously its a comic/horror extension of Zombieland where the zombies are all strippers, and that concept is somewhat fun. The problem is the same problem that plagues every Kauffman film, 90 minutes of purely sophomoric humor that gradually grates on you until you wonder why you're wasting you time on another Kauffman film. The comedy just isn't funny, unless you live for the American Pie type potty/stupid sex humor, and the production values are weak. Its clearly a film haphazardly captured and edited, and you feel this lack of talent, care and diligence throughout. Sorry, but this guy's films are just awful."
1,Doesn't Fit Tungsten E2,"I found this case via a search for a Tungsten E2 case. Don't buy it for an E2. The E2 is too big for the case.It's a nice case. Maybe I'll keep it in case I get a Blackberry someday. ;-)P.S. I ordered another size, 'SMALL', and the Tungsten E2 seems to fit just fine. Go with that size."
3,"Great case, but don't use Multidapt","Krusell Multidapt Horizontic PDA X-Small, BlackI like the form factor and style of this case very much! It makes the use of my PalmOne Zire 31 very handy, given its magnetic closure and handy slots for my expansion cards.However, I would not recommend the Multidapt clip usage -- it appears to be very handy, but it is not secure enough. Against my better judgment, I used it and it allowed my Zire 31 to fall into the toilet as I stood up. That was the end of that Zire 31 -- despite my quick reaction! :-( My new Zire 31 is still housed in this case, but only used with the secure belt loop provided in the leather. Used in this way I would give case 5 stars. The 3-star rating is given because Krusell hypes the Multidapt so much and I find it unsuitable for this application."
3,Watch out for this crap version!,"Unfortunately, I did not check the aspect ratio of this DVD before I ordered and was severely disappointed to see it is a butchered 33:1 version. I NEVER knowingly buy these ""full screen"" abominations. Checking at the IMDb website verified this was originally an 1.85:1 movie. With the expansive vistas of ocean surf shown in this movie, it is criminal chopping it up like this; there oughta' be a law! The movie itself was ok; ""Step Into Liquid"" is superior."
4,What a wave!!!,"Has by far the sickest ride at Jaws that I have ever seen (Parsons). Overall a great movie, but wtf is Laird. You can't talk about big waves without talking about Laird."
4,Amazing footage of the big waves,"This film is basically a documentary which shows the outer limits of modern-day surfing. Instead of paddling into the wave in the traditional manner, surfers can be pulled into the surf by waverunners and can take advantage of huge waves which form many miles from the shore. The Billabong Odyssey is a 3-year project in which new technology is used to train surfers and to detect the locations of the ""biggest waves on the planet"". There is a lot of emphasis on safety in the project, which is understable when people are challenging 50 and 60-foot waves. The first part of the movie shows the assembling of the team for the project and the training that they go through. The culminating scenes show a Big Wave competition in ""Jaws"", a surfing hot spot off the coast of Maui. The photography is spectacular and the movie is appealing to surfers and non-surfers alike."
3,"Lotsa talk, little surf","I got this flick hoping to extend the high i got off Step Into Liquid and Thicker Than Water. Instead I got a snoozefest of personal interviews and pro surfer bios.Don't get me wrong, the big wave footage featured on the dvd is breathtaking, to say the least - there just isn't enough of it on this disc to get me anywhere near stoked.I watched this once and dumped it in the pile for my next garage sale."
2,Billabong Odyssey,"Big build-up,but doesn't deliver the goods.Even though thereis some big surf,the quality of the surf and surfing is verymediocre."
2,boring,"If you're a stoked surfer looking for a thrill, this is ""NOT"" the video for you. However, if you want a training video on big wave surfing, go ahead. A better video for the stoke would be the classic Endless summer 2. Much more of a better buy. Billabong goes out of their way with a whole lot of explainations in Odyssey about tow-in surfing, training on watercrafts, and then they get to the surfing. I fell asleep throughout the 2/3 of it. I had to skip through half of it to get to the surfing. Nice documentary for Discovery Channel, not for the wired surf enthusiast. So,"
3,Can that be real??,"Worth it all for the first 3 minutes; can that be real?....It is. Overall not quite as entertaining as ""Step Into Liquid"", but a great time none-the-less."
4,A Mix of Incredible Surfing Imagery and Intro to Surfing Basics,"The opening sequence of surfer Mike Parsons dropping down the face of a gigantic wave is mesmerizing. That sequence alone is almost worth the price of purchase, but there is plenty of other amazing, jaw-dropping video to admire that makes this video attractive to anyone with affinity for wave and board sports. You do get a chance to let your attention drift from time to time as the story drags on the less interesting filler. The pontification about wave formation and rescue training for the Billabong team is a bit overdone, but these sections allow the adrenaline to subside a bit before launching into more spectacular footage. The short pieces on kite boarding, wind-surfing aerobatics, and hydroplane boards are interesting filler, too. This is a good video both for those already deep into the sport and for those who only want to frolic in the water for a while."
3,Interesting. Great footage.,"Great footage. Not really a very in depth movie. I think I was hoping for surfing/tropical beaches - a ""take me on vacation from the comfort of my couch"" movie. It is not. But it is a really interesting documentary on big wave and tow-in surfing."
2,VERIZON USERS BEWARE!,"VERIZON USERS BEWARE! Due to no fault of this seller (product did not come in retail box, but came in tact), Verizon users will only be able to back up their address book (inadequately at that), not transfer photos or ringtones. After many calls (the seller, verizon and motorola) I found out that Verizon puts a block on the phones so that you have to use THEIR services and motorola software will NOT work completely."
3,Motorola Phone Tools,"I purchased this software hoping to be able to download pictures from my Motorola W385 phone to my computer. According to the product description, this can be done. However, I have been unable to do so. It appears that my phone provider, Verizon, blocks this feature in the software, as the logo in the window on my computer lacks the feature which does appear in the pdf manual. I saw after I made the purchase a note in a review that this is the case. Apparently Verizon wants you to purchase the plan which includes emailing pictures. My need is not that great.Other than that, the software does as advertised. I have backed up my phone numbers to my computer, and can charge the phone using the included usb cord, which can be a convenience."
1,Didn't work w/ Vista or my Motorola V3a,"I could never get this to work correctly with either of my Windows Vista computers. I ended up getting a copy of 5.0 from some where else and it worked fine. Couldn't up grade w/ this software to the new version, so a total waste of money."
3,Motorola Phone Tools,I can't fault the product. The seller advertised it as for all motorola phones. This is not true. It does not work with the KRZR. So I can't say whether the product is good or bad. Check [...] for compatibility before purchasing this software. The seller either does not know the product or just lies about it.
2,"Lots of action, but too much heartbreak for me!","As Liz and Brad manage the Grant Hotel, Harmony and Billymarry and move to the woods. In the meantime, Thad, Liz's youngest,sets out to see the world and become her ""prodigal"" son. I hope the next and final book, #8, is more positive and less violent. This one left me with a bad taste."
3,BEWARE>> NOT SOLD IN HARD CASE!,I just want everyone to know that the bits are shipped in a blister pack and come in a little pouch not the hard case as shown and desribed. I had Amazon send me a replacement set telling them I didnt get the hard case and I got the exact same set with the pouch. I have looked all over and everyone else selling this set has the hard case. I have no idea why Amazon's set comes in a cheap little pouch. It does have the same UPC code on it also.
5,The must for numbers,"you often resolve equations and optimize systems in variables... well this is the book that puts numbers to those variables, so you can start talking about how much.if you are a serious chemical engineer, you will buy this."
4,Really good.,Very Good Product. Only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because with the newest update it tends to crash a bit more if it is Jailbroken and It is slower but if you disable spotlight search that helps alot.
1,Fake Phone,The item received was Counterfeit. I ordered two phones and got them verified at the apple store. The representative at APPLE confirmed that both the IPHONES(So Claimed) are fake.HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT
1,cheated,I bought a new iphone 3G international version on march 3 2011from amazon (fulfilled by iabebay llc)when I turned it on I saw the phone book is full with hundreds of phone numberseven an e-mail account and addressI took it to an official apple store here in Turkeythey said the phone is used and back casing is not originaland side buttons are not working smoothly.
2,se actualizo y quedo en modo recuperacion,compre el iphone por este medio y llego en perfectas condicionesla unica lata que lo conecte al itunes y quedo en modo de recuperacion y no puedo hacer nadayo no se que solucion me dan pero necesito que el iphone funcione o que me devuelvan la platayo soy de chile estoy bastante lejos pero por favor les pido que tengan ojo al comprar.....
3,not as loud as I had hoped,"Cute but not loud enough. I love bells and finally found this bracelet, but was disappointed with the soft sound."
4,An ABC's Guide to Ribbon Embroidery,"If you have never done ribbon embroidery, you might want to choose another book for your first instruction book. But if you already have some experience, this book offers inspriation as well as guidance. There's not much in the way of basic information, such as choosing fabrics or ribbons, but each letter of the alphabet offers a new example of doing ribbon monograms as well as illustrated step-by-step instructions for various stitches and flowers. They have to stretch things a little on some letters (even THEY couldn't think up any flowers that start with X). Every letter also features a full color photograph of the stitches/flowers used for that letter, as well as a multi-color stitch guide to follow. While I haven't used any of their guides ""as is,"" I have found their projects inspirational. The instructions for stitches easy to understand and the alphabetical organization of stitches and flowers helpful in planning my own projects."
4,A lot of bang for the buck!,This is a lot of toy for the money. It is great for interactive and imaginative play.
5,WOW!,This set came two days after I ordered it. As soon as I opened the package I was amazed. I can't wait for Xmas to give this to my grandson. I am 100% sure he is going to love this. The set has many interactive parts to play with and he has a great imagination. I would not recommend this for a 3yo. I was so excited about this toy that I uploaded pictures for the first time so I could share this great deal.
4,Cool Ali,I enjoy reading books to my eight year old. I also like to get or see the expressions on her face. This book is an easy reader for her and she enjoys fantasy stories. She like to make up her own.I recommend this book to parents who like to read to their kids/kids that are in second grade and are on the Book It Club.This book made her talk about it to her teacher and classmates and gave them ideas for a school project.
1,Smells really bad,"This product isn't bad in terms of effectiveness, but its strong and NAUSEATING SMELL literally made me gag. It smells sickeningly sweet like a pound of saccharine or something. What the heck were the manufacturers thinking when they think that this is an ok smell to put on one's face?! Sigh, I still have 3 jars left...I have only put this on my hands so far because I can't stand the smell."
5,Love It.,"This is one of the richest, most hydrating moisturizers I have ever used. I have been using it for about a year now and in the summer I use it at night 2-3 nights a week. During the winter I can use it during the day since the elements are so much more harsh. The combination of oils and vitamins in this cream make it a winner. I actually like the smell, it smells like candy and fades away fast. I notice how plump my face is the morning after I use this. A must try. Plus it is not tested on animals or made with any animal ingredients."
1,Maybe the worst Santana album,"This is, in my opinion, the worst Santana album out there. The album stinks because it is too poppy and synthetic. (I hate the synthesizers) There are a few decent sounds on this album, but the majority are of unusually poor quality."
1,not his best work...,"If you're looking for ""Abraxas"" type fireworks, forget it. Seems as if this CD was done to fulfill a contractual obligation, they should have kept this one in the can. I borrowed this from my local library, I would have been upset if I had paid for it. I guess even an extremely talented and creative guy like Carlos Santana has an off day..."
3,Read With Caution,"I am glad I purchased the book. It is fortunate that such a family record even exists. However, it is unfortunate the book contains many errors in names, dates, and locations. The errors you can detect based on your personal or family knowledge will lead you to question how reliable and useful the book is. You might feel like you need to attempt to verify those things in the book that are the most important to you. Nevertheless, I believe the book is worth owning and reading."
3,Might be better off finding these elsewhere,I used these inside my car to hold aluminum door panels to the door. They arent exposed to water but are exposed to humidity. The caps show signs of rust however the rust somewhat wipes away. It does come back eventually but they do not stay black even after not being exposed to water. They are strong and didnt have any of them break on me. I would buy again for non-visual applications.
2,Not Great,"There are some useful information in this work and some genuinely interesting insights. Unfortunately there is also a lot of really bad quack science interspersed through out the book that I find really off putting. Two right off the top of my head are the idea that Westerners need to eat meat and consume alcohol, and that we normally only think with the left side of our brain.Further from it's obsession over the forebrain and brain stem et al to it's comments on the macrobiotic diet, the text is firmly rooted in the late 1970's making it dated at best.Combined with the reptition (how many times is the word ""coffin"" used throughout the text?) and the disjointed feel of the question and answer format, it is in my view just not a very good introduction."
5,I live by this book.,"This is what buddhism is all about. It is a shame that the master is dead. He answers everything that you wanted to know about zen. He discusses God, meditation, koans, and sitting. He reconcils buddhism and christian living. His mondo really teaches how to be an authentic person in a phony world."
4,Reverse the Curse!,"True, ""Tessie"" is not a typical Dropkick Murphy's song, but as a diehard Red Sox fan who saw the premier of this song at the Red Sox vs. Yankees game awhile back, I thought it was an important piece to add to my collection.The one thing you can always say about the Dropkick Murphy's is how they are a big supporter of their hometown sport teams and this CD features ""The Official Anthem of the Boston Red Sox.""If you are not a Red Sox fan, do not get the CD. You will be disappointed. Otherwise, to all you Red Sox fans out there, buy the CD and help Reverse the Curse!"
5,"Red Sox and Dropkicks', a perfect match.","A great track worthy to be the new anthem for Red Sox Nation. It sure sounded great in Fenway this weekend, fresh after the Sox having whipped the Yankees. Nice job Dropkicks', Go Sox, World Series Champions 2004 ! ! !"
2,Not Very Good,"I am giving this 2 stars instead of just 1 star because the CD is only $5. I think the song Tessie is absolutely aweful and has shown how far off this band is now from the olden days of Do or Die. The good news is they didn't write the song, so maybe there is still some hope that future songs won't be as bad as this one. I find it also bad that this horrible song isn't only on this disc once, but there's two versions of it, and each sound equally as bad. I didn't really enjoy any of the other songs on this CD either. I hope for some better things in the future from the Dropkick Murphys, but in the meantime I'll listen to my Flogging Molly and Street Dogs CDs, as those bands have seemed to surpass DKM in terms of quality music."
2,Please include,"Please include in the explanation that this video specifically tells of the teachings of the Latter Day Saints Church. I would not have ordered it had I known that. Not that I am anti-LDS, but I wouldn't use this in my church as it is contrary to what we teach. It would be a great video though for LDSers to know about!"
1,Oh come on!!!,"What do we possibly need to know about Paolini!! I could care less, and I'm certain the only people who are interested is his family and girls that think he's cute! Give me a break!! Whoever came up with this idea is totally insane. The less we know about Paolini, the less we'll hate him and his book!!"
2,Central America by train,I did not like this video trip. Most of the video was showing faces of people inside the train. Not enough video on landscape or interesting scenary. It could have been much more interesting since it travelled through some exotic places.
5,"Great history, well written",Loved the book! I felt the culture and life of the club and can't wait for day I can visit cuba.Thanks so much Ms. Lowinger.
4,Havana Before Castro,"An entertaining and informative book about the fabled Tropicana nightclub in Havana -- the most dazzling club back in the days when the mob ruled Cuba, and still being run as a (somewhat more subdued) tourist attraction by the Castro regime. This is part as-told-to autobiography by the wife of the club's owner back in the Fifties and part history of the club by the book's co-author. Chatty and discursive, it still manages to evoke the past glories of the place and to provide some solid facts about it."
4,Great Album,I thought this was an awesome CD. Great to just chill out to. The Cynic and The Curse of Being a Girl are probably some of my favorite songs now. Definitely worth the extra expense to get it from out of the country.
1,"KId Who Can,t Play Baseball","The book No Arm in Left field is about a black kid who is new in town named Terry Delaney and plays baseball. The kid can't throw the ball. This kid also swings at high and outside pitches. There is also a kid who doesn't like the new kid. His name is Tony Casterline, he plays shortstop. During the games Tony doesn't go out for the cutoff so he makes Terry look bad, because he can't throw the ball. Terry and Tony end up being like best friends by the end of the book. So the two kids end up working together."
2,"""Snow Day: BIG Bore and WASTE of Money""","I first saw Snow Day in theaters two days after it came out. It wasn't that funny but quite entertaining and enjoyable. After it came out on DVD, I took it just to remember what it was like. BORING! It's completely a waste of time. And it's plain stupid....I returned the movie as soon as I watched it for the second time.Folks, do not rent this movie. AND DO NOT BUY!..."
1,What horrrible filmmaking,"This film is just horrible. People probably went to see it because the trailer looked funny, but this is one of the worst films ever! It's disgusting, like when Snowplow Man eats French fries using ketchup on a boy's jacket who farts a lot. After seeing it, everyone was downright disappointed. The humor was infantile and the gags are gross. By the way, who came up with a dumb script like this? Do not buy it, it is not even worth a single penny. I didn't even laugh. Not once."
1,THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!!!!!,This movie was so boring i fell asleep during it. The best part was the ending!
1,"Terrible Film, DO NOT SEE, DO NOT BUY",This movie doesn't even deserve the one star that I gave it. I wish I could give it 0 stars. The movie was NOT funny at all and had no action. I didn't like this movie at all. I can't think of any age group that would like this movie.
5,Fun family Movie!,You will want to watch this fun family movie over and over. Those of you who grew up sitting by the radio on a snowing school day morning can relate to the joy of when you hear your school is closed for the day!!
4,Great Kid's Movie!,"If you are or have a child who watches Nickelodian, than they are sure to love Snow Day because it is made by Nickelodian! It's about a guy who desperately wants a date with a girl. When a snow day hits, his sister tells him that anything can happen on a snowday. So he tries to win her affection resulting in halarious consequences. Meanwhile, his sister and her friends are trying to stop the snow plow man from ruining another snowday! Youre kids will love it! Buy it today!"
1,Absolutely HORRIBLE!!!,"This is by far the worst movie I saw all year! I really like kids movies and all of the other movies releases by Nick Studios, but this one was BAD!! It had a very stupid, uninteresting plot and characters that you don't care about what happens to them. The best thing about the movie is the single ""Another Dumb Blonde"" in the movie by Hoku. I don't understand how so many people saw this movie at theatres. Skip this one and go for Flintstones 2 or Toy Story 2 for recent GREAT kids or family movies."
3,Showed in a 5th grade classroom,"This was ok. I think the kids enjoyed it mostly since it was new to them. Some aspects of the movie made me cringe. There was a focus of a ""hot girl"" which made it slightly wierd."
5,Well pleased with order,"I have always enjoyed this movie. It reflects how children, young and old, get excited when the snow begans to fall. We imagine building snowmen, having snowball fights and stoking the fireplace for a warm winters night. We especially hope that the snow will be deep enough to cancel school and/or work for at least a day."
3,Snow Day...How appropriate is this movie?,"I recently watched ""Snow Day"", and I must say I enjoyed the film. It actaully had me throroughly invovled on a Sunday afternoon, recovering from the night before. One reason why i was so involved was because of the young starlet who plays the crush of one of the main characters. She was stunning, but i did notice something that parents might want to consider:While at her window, this young lady is in nothing but her Pj's, which consist of a white, spaghetti string tank top...no bra underneath. Well, anyway, i had no problem with this, but i think that parents might not want their kids to see the nipples of a young woman in a movie directed towards their kids. Again though...good movie, i loved the window part...but some might object."
4,Can't every day be a snow day?,"I thought this was a great movie for kids and for adults. I really enjoyed the antics of the kids and the sweet, budding relationship between two childhood friends. The little brother in this movie was extremely funny and Claire and her exboyfriend were a riot. This is a great winter movie to snuggle in with and watch with the whole family."
4,Rockin Movie,"I really like this moviw for 2 reasons:A: It catches the atmospere of a real snow day!B: I love some of the humor.Of course, this movie had it's downs, including close-ups of rotten teeth, pretty stupid stop motion sequence, and the romance....Also, the target audience is not known. I'm still not sure who the main charicter is...If anybody just wants to chat, neomail me at [...]"
2,"Fun, but strictly for kids","Snow day is an OK movie. But adults may find it a bit boring. It is by the way a nickelodeon movie, so it aims at younger viewers. Despite it is only 89 mins, 84 mins for the features and 5 minutes for the credit, the movie feels a bit long. Not enough Chevy Chase, so the funny moments are limited as well. The younger actors' give excellent performances. The DVD's picture quality is OK and the 5.1 Dolby Digital has very limited activities. It worths to be watched once not to keep. Just rent this one."
3,bought used,"the presentation is nice, but the electronic aspect is extremely quirky. we purchased the dart board second hand, but all items were still in original packaging. i like the idea of using metal tips and having electronic scoring, but what is the use if it does not work properly."
1,Failed to Launch,After setting everything up it just didn't power up. I returned to retailer that I purchased from and the cashier said someone else just returned one that had a problem. Bad batch or bad Chi-Com electronics? With only 2 data points I would not recommend.
2,Dart Board,Nice board but we are already having problems with the sensors picking up the darts. What a hassle to have a product of that size having issues less than a month into purchase and having to figure out how to return it.
1,I Expected a Lot More,"We have a calibration standard for checking tire pressure gauges at work. I found this gauge to read 2.5 PSI higher than the standard at 40 PSI. Lower readings were closer. Higher readings were worse. This unit is flimsy and rather delicate. To get the tire gauge I needed, I wound up paying more than double the price of this unit. So, perhaps my expectations were set too high."
5,...with knobs on!,"This is my favourite Jeeves & Wooster story yet. It had me laughing out loud; a bit annoying for my wife trying to work nearby. This is a great story and a handsomely bound, affordable book from Overlook."
3,"Great Book, Small Font","I love Wodehouse's Jeeves book. My review and rating concern the Overlook Press edition. While this edition is commendable in many ways, it falls short in one critical respect. The hardcover, binding, and paper are very nice. However, the font is small. I'm not that old, and I read a lot for work and pleasure. The font is appreciably smaller than usual for hardbacks, paperbacks, magazines, newspapers, and journal articles. It strains the eyes. So, while Wodehouse's content would merit a 5, this edition gets a 3. Hopefully, this review will help someone who (like me) is already a fan of Wodehouse and is looking for a nice hardcover. This edition would be perfect if the font were larger."
5,Not like the Da Vinci Code at all,"While this book was quite enjoyable, it is not a thriller, filled with twists and conspiracies and secret societies, along the lines of the Da Vinci code, which starred Tom Hanks. In fact, there is no code-breaking at all. Read this book for its comedy, not for its code."
1,BEWARE of LA Theatre Works audio version--mislabeled!,"BEWARE! I bought this at the bargain price of $3.95 for a supposedly ""unabridged"" audio recording of Wodehouse's book. What I got was a 3-hour theater production -- not the audiobook edition at all! The dead giveaway is as follows:Publisher: L.A. Theatre Works-- that is, a theatrical company, not an audiobook publishing house. So the headline -- ""The Code of the Woosters [Unabridged] [Audible Audio Edition]"" -- is completely misleading. Instead of one person reading you the complete text of the original book, you get several actors acting out a very abridged version of the book (as if it's a play, and given the audience applause, it may well have been a play that they recorded).I have brought this mistake to the attention of Amazon's customer service department and asked for a refund (so I can go buy the real thing). On the other hand, if you really want a 3-hour shortened theatrical version of this novel... then this recording is fine."
3,Didn't really care for it,"It was recommended by my book club, so I read it. Had it not been the choice of the club, I would never have picked it up. Fortunately, it's on my Kindle, so I don't have a paperback hanging around collecting dust."
5,Perhaps the greatest novel in the English Language.,"Too often short-changed as just ""amusing satire"" or ""a send-up of a by-gone era in British society"", at his best, P.G. Wodehouse is, in my opinion, the greatest pure writer of the English Language of the Twentieth Century. His economy of language, the precision of his metaphors, the perfect symmetry of his plot structures, and the sheer hilarity of his skewering insights into human nature are reminiscent of, but, I think, a cut above the writings of Mark Twain. I am hungrily devouring all the Wodehouse I can get my hands on, but this is the best I've read so far. I couldn't possibly recommend this book highly enough."
5,Wodehouse at his sharpest and most farcical,"The misadventures of Bertie Wooster and his loyal gentleman's gentleman Jeeves have never been wittier. Wodehouse outdid himself with this classic; every line is a howler and every character, from Aunt Dahlia, to Roderick Spode, to ""Stinker"" Pinker and that ""Spink-Bottle"" to Bertram himself...just perfect gems of literary shenanigans. Read this book for no other reason than to bask in the obvious joy Wodehouse took in his language and in the work and play of writing!"
5,Better than a shrink for a dour mood,Wodehouse's brilliance is shown by not only his prose but that fact that he can keep a story going with it's following the thinnest of threads. And it's always hilarious.If you've not read Wodehouse. Do. Thirty minutes of reading about Jeeves and Wooster are a better tonic than any shrinks 50 minute hour.
4,One of the Best,"This book and its twists and turns is a great light read. The adventures of Bertie Wooster and his man Jeeves are always enjoyable but this is one of the best. In it, Wodehouse pokes fun at the upper crust in England, the mania some people have for science, fascists like the Blackshorts, etc. Well worth the time to find and read!"
2,Cute Story but Very Theologically Incorrect,"A friend of ours gave us this movie for Christmas.The story is very cute, and in the end, the littlest angel (and all the rest of us) learns about sacrifice, good works, and sticking by your friends. Those are all wonderful lessons to teach my children.But they will not be watching this again. I endeavor to teach my children about God and his creation, which includes angels and heaven, from what the Bible actually says about them. This story includes too many incorrect elements: angels are not people who have died, animals do not become angels, angels are never disobedient of rude or unhappy, and they do not have to ""earn"" their wings. To top it all off, one of the angels in the movie says ""What the heck"" which is SO ironically incorrect I would have laughed if I hadn't been so stunned. Anyway, kids grow up with enough strange perceptions about the world on their own. Why feed it to them on purpose?"
4,Spidey and the Sinister Five,"This would be one wicked set if it wasn't for the Black Cat. I was excited that the Cat was getting a Marvel Legend figure and it looked good while it was still in the box. Once I took it out I was disappointed. It is simply overarticulated so that it won't even stay standing with it's base. The rest of the figures in this set were great. Electro is easily my favorite,the articulation on this figure is perfect and the likeness is spot on."
1,kipor inverter cover,"it doesn't fit, now why does that not surprise me that they would not check to see if it fits an ig6000! when that's what pops up to purchase a cover for a kipor ig6000?"
5,A brilliant Hollywood comedy,"Do not miss this picture! This is the film that blows away all the other ""movie industry"" comedies of the last few years. If you liked ""Swimming with Sharks"" or ""The Player,"" you will love ""Mistress."" Eli Wallach should be on the cover of this DVD along with Wuhl, Landau, De Niro, and Aiello. You couldn't ask for a more perfect cast, and I don't know how Barry Primus brought them all together. The only down side to this DVD release seems to be the 1.33:1 ""full screen"" image format. I wish they had released this in the theatrical aspect ratio, since I've been wondering what I've missed by seeing only the VHS release. This is a brilliant and subtle comedy for movie fans everywhere."
3,Delta Faucet 1343 Classic Tub/Shower,"Needed to replace shower control, picked this faucet. It was easy for me to install, and am happy with all except the tub spout. Whether the problem is caused by our possible lower water presure, or the valve knob thing is too loose, it drips water when the shower is used. Comparing to the old tub spout, the new one appears to not be as tight. The old one did not drip water."
1,"Bad Quality, worse customer service, worst repair center","I was excited when I bought my camera: Pretty style, easy to use, decent pictures w/o digital zoom (w/digital too grainy). Nightmare began after 8 months (an 500 pictures)It started to fail to turn off, then died. To reset it I had to take the battery off and install it again.No more battery trick after 1 week then I shipped to repair center. Came back and after 3 times I used it, same problem. Called Panasonic because the problem was not fixed and their (if you can name it this way) Cust. Serv. Rep suggested me to buy a new camera since repairs have only one month of warranty and my original warranty had expired.I am upset because they didn't fix it. I understand any electronic product may fail but their obligation is to repair it, not send it back without fixing it.Will never buy Panasonic cameras again, not even take them as a gift.If you want a camera, buy it from a camera company (Nikon, Canon) not from a TV company"
2,Grainy pics,It's ok. The camera looks great. Although every shot I took came out grainy. I returned it 3 days later. I was very unsatisfied with this camera.
5,Sexy as Hell,"I think I spent several months trying to make a decision on which digi to go for, but I finally rested on this wonderful Lumix camera. I can't help but buy on design (which is why I had an instant attraction to the Sony T1), but the Lumix FX7 is not just a pretty package. It has an enormous 2.5'' LCD screen which I love. The camera is so small; exactly the same size as a business card or an iPod mini (a lil thicker, of course).Some of the naysayers are complaining of digital cameras that don't have the optical viewfinder because it helps stabilize an image, but this digi comes with an image stablization system like the big SLRs so you don't have to worry too much about blurry images.If you'd like more info on this camera, go to http://www.dcresource.com/reviews/panasonic/dmc_fx7-review/index.shtml . Now if only I could find a nice sleeve that could fit the camera snugly."
3,D-Cell flashlight doesn't hold a candle to the rechargables!,"The construction of MagLite flashlights is great. However, if you really need some ""juice"", get yourself a rechargable version. They are a lot more pricey (around $100), but if you really need a flashlight for work -- it is well worth it. Many police officers (like myself) use rechargable MagLites. They typically hold a charge throughout an 8 hour shift and are a LOT brighter. They are rugged and reliable -- the D-cell type make good ""back-up"" lights though."
4,good for the price,"My husband loves Maglite, i bought this one thinking it was the same as his black 1, and i was surpised that it wasnt as bright. But then i noticed it wasn't LED as is his other one. It is still pretty bright and i personally wouldnt have paid an extra $8 for LED. so overall happy with it"
5,The Only Flashlight On My Ambulance,"I won't use any flashlight other than MagLite; I don't know a Paramedic or Sheriff Officer who carries anything else! The power of the beam, and the ability to focus it is invaluable. Also, my maglite is indestructable- I've dropped in ditches, on the concrete, in the toilet :), and had just about anything you can imagine spilled or splattered on it, and it always turns on. I have this (featured) 2 D-cell in black, and a 2 AA-cell in red that I carry on my belt, plus my ambulance has 2 of the big 4 cell MagLites on it at all times. MagLite is the best in performance, design, and durablity that I have found- and think about it: LIVES depend on me having a flashlight that works!"
5,Getting it right!,"Perfect size for nightstand or car. Bright, sturdy, and, also important, easy on the batteries. Most D-cell flashlights slowly discharge batteries and need fresh ones every year. Batteries in the Maglites stay fresh at least three years.Last resort defensive weapon, reliable source of bright light, sturdy build, and good components. Mag keeps getting it right!"
4,Good Old Flashlight,"Extremely durable, high quality, everyone knows the MagLite. I think I bought my first MagLite almost 20 years ago now and there are no obvious difference between it and the one I just bought.However, I'm going to take one star off just because it hasn't changed in 20 years. Over 10 years ago, I held in my hands a flashlight that made an evenly lit circle of light, yet the MagLite beam is still a mottled mess. Why can't they put some effort into improvements? Aluminum gets bent and scraped up easily. A high quality plastic could be at least as durable, possibly lighter, and would damage floors, cars, furniture as much when dropped. Just as another option in a line of quality flashlights, not a replacement.What about a lithium ion battery rechargeable? Much power in a very small package. Seems like they could progress a little... and no, I don't really like the light from the LED version."
2,Get something else!,"I don't understand why anyone raves about this. It's extremely heavy, not very bright, has a large central black spot, casts very uneven light, lights up only a small area. Yes, it focuses and can shine a spot a fair distance, but it won't help you walk in the dark or search an entire room quickly. Buy The AMAZING 95 LED Aluminum Flashlight instead!!!"
3,"2 ""D"" Cell Blue Mag Lite","I was pleased to locate this item in the color I needed. The Mag Lite is just as expected. No problems whatsoever with the product. However, it did take a longer to arrive than I anticipated. R D Anderson"
1,too weak,"heavy, weak, and not luminous, I would count it as a bad experience, plus it consume a lot more light than LED's"
4,"Good price, decent flashlight","Maglites are great as they are very sturdy and work well. This unit is no exception as it works flawlessly. Note, however, that this uses a different kind of bulb. In the older days, these maglites used regular standard flashlight bulbs, but this one uses a newer adapter that accepts the bi-pin plug-in type bulbs (similar to the bulbs used in the mini-maglites). So, if you're planning to use one of the LED replacement bulbs sold on Amazon, be careful as the LED bulb may not allow you to screw the retainer collar on it. Fortunately, the thread on the retainer collar is the same as used on the older maglites, so if you can buy a replacement collar for the older maglites, it will work (I cannibalized a retainer from an older 3-D cell maglite and it worked perfectly.)"
5,Fried Food will Kill Ya!,"Fried Food will Kill Ya! But what a way to go!!This is a down home how to fry handbook. It tells you the best methods of frying for different foods. It covers how to get the most out of your oils and explains the different oils and their qualities and when or how you would use them, along with the different temperatures and time for different types of food. Rick also goes over SAFETY and things you need to be careful of when cooking with hot oils.Then there are the recipes, I hate recipe books that are full of crazy recipes the common Joe would never try or have the time or ingredients to make, we have all seen those, well NOT HERE! These are recipes you are more than likely going to use, maybe not all of them, but a lot of them if you are interested in frying food. And the results are Yummy.It may not be the healthiest way to eat, but if you are going to have some deep fried food shouldn't it be the best tasting batch you can make/eat??5 Stars and 2 thumbs up from me!"
3,Disappointing.,"When I purchased this, I was under the assumption that the book was going to be all about Wrestlecrap and the bad ideas in wrestling over the years, but it wasn't. Instead, I got a book that simply detailed the history of WCW and the WWF (mentioning both the good and the bad). While that's a nice little story in it's own right, that's not what I paid for. I got the book to read about the likes of Papa Shango and Repo Man, not the Monday ratings wars. While it's true that certain gimmicks are covered, they're only presented in these two ways:A.) Barely described and only given one sentence or paragraph.orB.) Copied and pasted from the WrestleCrap site.There are far superior wrestling books out there."
2,Disappointing,"As someone who really liked the website, this has two major problems. One is that it isn't nearly as funny as the website. The other is that if you're going to make fun of something, even when it deserves to be made fun of, you really need to have your facts straight. Almost every chapter has multiple factual errors."
4,Funny Read,The laughter received from reading the book was worth the money spent. I am surprised that no mention of Dusty Rhodes as the Midnight Rider was mentioned. Good book to take a trip down memory land and revisit the lapses of judgement along the way.
1,"Flimsy construction, didn't last long at all","I had purchased a lesser expensive Slime pump and when it had broken down after 6 months of use, I wrote an E-mail to Slime explaining my frustration with it's poor quality. God bless Slime's costumer service, they gave me no hassles and sent me an upgraded pump in the mail as a free replacement.It was bigger and looked sturdier. After two months of rare usage, this thing breaks down. The frame starts twisting with each pumping action and eventually one of the spring pins broke out of it's slot. Now it takes about 5-10 minutes to pump a tire.I would not recommend this product, nor any other Slime product for that matter. For a good reason why Slime products break down in such a short period, check the sticker underneath the product: ""Made In..."""
1,Pice of Pump. Extrelemy dissapointed,Used this pump twice and when I needed to pump up a low tire on our car the plastic nozzle snapped making it useless. It just cracked in half. No real force but just borke. What was angering is that I had used the pump only once before (to pump a wheelbarrow tire) the past summer and this was only the second time I went to use it and it failed basically letting most of the air out of the tire of the car before I could pry the broken valve assemvly off the valve stem. So i had to make a quick trip to the gas station to fill it back up before I ran into trouble. I would SOOOOOO like to get my money back but I bought this at Home Depot over the summer.Its a pice of junk so dont waste your money. Even the rubber feet all fell off as soon as I took it out of the packaging. I had to glue these back on just so I wouldnt loose them.Sad quality pump so much so i was infuriated. Heavy duty pump yeah right?
1,Nothing Funny About This,"I watched this on PPV based on mixed reviews. Okay, I was in the mood for a comedy and thought I'd take a chance. Mistake. This ""film"" would appeal to boys 18-24 when drinking until stupified and then vomiting is considered an entertainment option.I've been through Tacoma--lots of trailers and the Tacoma aroma. OMG that smell. I had always thought of Washington state as pine scented and picturesque and it may be but NOT in Tacoma. Same goes for the movie."
1,W Mag: Worth the cost ?,"I personally had never read this maginze until a friend sent a subscription to me. I don't understand why she bought it for me. This magnize features three things: clothes, accesories, and stories of the rich and famous. The clothing and accesories are all designer, which is great if you are into super-expensive clothing. Also the outfits shown are ridicius. They look the outfits out of some cheesy B- movie, or possibly a bunch of mops sewn together. I doubt anyone can really tell what they are. The only other thing in this magazines are stories of the super elite celebrities and royalty, which are incredibly boring. Please don't waste your money on this magazine, it's not worth it."
1,Commercialized glossy porn in ads and features,"I subscribed hoping for a wide-ranging view of fashion shows and contemporary art. While there was an interesting article on an aging art auctioneer, several ads featured male and female nudes crouching or huddling in homoerotic poses. One feature had garish clothes on models posed in front of small suburban houses...how quaint. Another ""fashion"" spread had a young woman being kidnapped, a bag put over her head, handcuffed, and finally posed nude facing a wall. Degrading and violent sexualized images of women. That's not fashion...it's pornography.This magazine might appeal to older people who came of age in the 1960s (plastic surgery article, gaudy jewelry ads) who ""celebrate"" the sexual revolution and don't think much of the dignity of the human body.I can't see this magazine staying in existence much longer."
2,rip off,"I canceled my subscription after receiving my first issue. They started the subscription with an old issue, even though an up to date one was already on the news stands. There were so many adds, they should have been paying me. I refuse to support a magzine that is heavy on adds, slim on content and sends your first issue from their old back stock."
1,Ugly,"There was a time when this was the publication to have in the fashion world. Now it's just sad. There is no acknowledgement of trends or styles, nothing cutting edge. They no longer define fashion, they just destroy it. They are so concerned with contorting art that they ruin it. Everything they produce is ugly and disturbing. What is wrong with pretty? This rag looks like it is produced by people who hate the feminine form and feel they must distort it. It's bad enough that most publications require models to be thin and they alter the photos to lengthen legs, arms, and torsos. But that's not enough for this magazine. No, they must make their models look like little boys in women's clothes with hair and make-up best suited for a freak show. And that's what the pages of W read like, photos of side show freaks."
2,Order it Directly From Conde Nast,"The photographs are simply amazing and the articles are great, Conde Nast is just a solid publisher of magazines. I know folks who get W just for the photography alone (much less the excellent fashion and trend-spotting). However, getting the magazine from Amazon proved a lot more trouble than it was worth.I tried ordering this as a gift off of my friend's wishlist. Four months later, my friend had yet to receive her first issue of her subscription. I called Conde Nast, I called Amazon: they insisted it was the other. Amazon offered to refund my money when all I really wanted was just the mere fulfillment of the order. So I went to W's web site and ordered it for a couple dollars less and they even included a gift e-mail with the order.I suggest you save yourself time and trouble and order directly from W's web site."
3,Fashion Advertisements,"This magazine has excellent fashion photography. Mostly this is in the form of advertisements, which take up the first 175 pages and many more throughout. The pages are almost twice the size of a standard magazine, which leaves room for more artistic ads. The articles, I find hard to relate to or take seriously. To me, they seem more like tabloid tales of sordid love affairs and over-hyped parties than any kind of actual informative articles. For a magazine that is touted as a fashion industry standard, I expected to see many more articles about fashion, styles, and designers rather than Hollywood gossip. The photographs and fashion advertisements really are great, and I believe they would be the most useful aspect of this magazine for people interested in fashion."
2,Mostly boring.,"I guess if you're one of those lucky people who has more money and time than they know what to do with, W is for you. This magazine focuses mostly on rich people, the clothes they buy, and the parties that they attend. I'm not just talking celebrities, either. If that was the case, then perhaps W would be onto something. But no... W prefers to devote at least half their articles to spotlighting people like Eugino Lopez, ""heir to the vast Jumex juice fortune."" And then they tell us about their beachfront properties, glittering social circles, and $1,700 Louis Vuitton Murakami purses. I don't know about you, but anyone who is willing to pay that much for something that looks like an embossed leather Hot Pocket isn't worth paying $4.50 to read about."
5,It's Quite Possibly the World's Fashion Bible.,"""W"" magazine is such an important staple in the world of fashion, that even guys like me can't help but read it. To call this a women's magazine would really be unfair, for it offers in-depth articles on the fashion industry, profiles on celebrities, and an excellent supplement for men published on a quarterly basis. This men's supplement offers fashion info that's hip and contemporary, but not trendy enough to spook the average American male. As with all fashion magazines, ""W"" could feature more models of color on their cover, but that's a relatively small gripe compared to the wealth of good stuff this magazine offers. Overall, bravo the folks at ""W"" a job well done!"
2,not much to read or learn,for ads only pretty much. there is not much to read or learn for the common reader. it seems like it's mailing for the fashion elite not for everyone.
1,alas not the great fashion tome it used to be,"once upon a time, W magazine was a fantastic fashion mag. it contained beautiful and innovative photography and intelligent articles about the best of fashion's best. something, alas, has changed. now the focus is on celebrities. yes, the photography is better than that found in Star or People, but the writing is just as gossip-focused, and no great insight is offered on the subjects. you won't learn anything new about anyone, but I found they weren't people I was interested in to begin with.and as for the fashion coverage, it's been shunted off to the side, limited to one pictorial spread. the size of the issue is now much smaller than back when I first subscribed.also, when I canceled my subscription early, for lack of wanting to read about yawn-inducing Hollywood flavors-of-the-hour, the publisher refused me any refund. buyer beware!"
1,Scandalous,"I'm a fashion student at Parsons school of design and have obviously been exposed to a variety of fashion magazines. I've been a reader of W for several years now and have watched it's level of controversy rise from edgy and risque to pornographically obscene. I was going through the current issue's fashion coverage while sitting on a train, and came across the most meretricious, vile and pornographic advertisment for Tom Ford's sunglasses line. I was completely shocked that censors would let such a sexually graphic image pass in a somewhat mainstream fashion mag. It was literally hard-core pornography (i'm not exaggerating)and i was embarressed to have come across this ad while sitting next to other people in a public place.I own hundreds of magazines and have yet to see such stupidity on the editor's part. I am no longer going to purchase W and i hope that the magazine's directors will have more sense and discretion in the future."
1,Where are my magazines?,"I bought my subscription on amazon for W on the first of january and since have recieved one issue, which was the introductory January one...it is now mid-April and i've yet to recieve a second? Needless to say I am very upset with W magazine for taking my money as I am an avid reader who works in the fashion industry. I just want my magazines. Thanks."
2,Average View of European Countries,"There are some really breathtaking scenes in Sweden,Norway and Finland....they are just mesmerizing!They show sheer natural beauty that is abundant in these countries. However,the effort fails to capture anything about Spain and Portugal at all...there are only passing references to Madrid and Lisbon that might have been a little better. In some places the photography is just high class....but at the same time in other places the camera work is really poor...showing only dark images.This sure doesn't help. In its informational content I feel there is a lot to be desired.It is able to provide only a broader picture...some elaborate descriptions might help. In short,the feature can be rated as average.It could have been presented in a more dramatic fashion.The narration is not very good either."
4,Bolivia 41,This is the most peculiar and thouroughly disturbing book I have ever read. The perfect choice for anyone who would like to break away from the same old novel. Uniquely written and oddley arranged this book is the type of book you want to read over and over. I highley recommend this one to anyone with a different take on life.
4,Strange and funny,"I'm not really sure this book deserves a 5 star rating, so I only gave it 4. However, it was excellent. I didn't want to put it down. I finished it in one day and loved every gruesome, gory, hilarious word of it. This book is brilliantly written from the heart of an excellet author. I hear he has a new book coming out soon and I can't wait to read it too."
3,Looks great but flimsy made,"The title says it all. The 30"" gearbox looks really great but is made of pretty flimsy sheet metal except for the doors themselves. I bought two units and, even though they were well packaged with wooden 2x4 bracing materials in the carton, one cabinet had a pretty severe dent on the front lower edge of the cabinet. I need to contact the manufacturer for a replacement unit. It is still functional but for what they cost I expect an undamaged unit upon arrival."
3,Good Cabinet very poor packaging and shipping,"Just like the two other reviews, my cabinet arrived with a huge nasty dent in the door and another on the top edge. I thought I might escape the curse but it was not to be...The cabinet is well constructed, welding is good, dimensionally correct and square.I disagree with the folks that think the steel is too thin. Its just fine and will hold up well -- anything heavier guage would increase the weight and make it weaker, not stronger-- trust me, I am a 35+ year engineer and have been there, done that.Mind boggling how the packaging and transport can be so poor to get these levels of denting on such a strong cabinet. Almost looks like a forklift was purposefully run into the package side. I have asked Amazon for compensation so we will see how that goes...Points off for the very poor packaging and transport."
4,I really like these!!,"I just picked up two of these. VERY happy with them.They are MUCH better than the ones you actually put together yourself. I was not a fan of those at all. They were flimsy, and it was a pain in the butt to put them together and then when they DID go together the joints were not tight.This is already pre-assembled and WELDED... key word being fully welded! It's how it should have been from day one.I am VERY pleased with these.So much better than the black and decker (compressed saw dust and glue cabinet that I paid around $160 for it at a big box store.. and that is already starting to ""sag"" because of the humitity...Overall this is a good buy, wish it was cheaper because at 200 bucks it's not cheap at all!Good lock, sturdy doors, and feels robust compared to their other model.-Nigel"
3,Nice cabinets - bad packaging,"I had a total of six of these cabinets shipped to my house. I was only able to install four, because two had large dents. The packaging is poor (see other reviews on this issue) and now I have to deal with replacing them which is a headache.The cabinet itself seems to be of good quality.Next time I will go with Geneva products which are made in the US (Gladiator is by Whirlpool)."
1,Does not work.,"The LED light on the reciever flashes as though it is recieving a signal, but the remote does not work."
5,A Modern Classic! One Of The Best Books I've Ever Read!,"This is an absolutely incredible novel! I found it in a used book store a few years ago and have read it no fewer than four times. It's graceful and poetic, yet funny. It's impossible to put down. The characters are unusual and lovable, Kim and Phinney in particular. You finish the book wanting to know more about these people and hoping everything turns out well for them. Each time I read the book, I pick up something that I missed the first time -- some subtle wordplay, a joke, a hint about what might happen. I didn't want this book to ever end.Does anyone know why this wasn't made into a movie? It would've been great. Does anyone know if the author has written anything else? I've heard rumors that he died in a car accident or that he quit writing to teach law school. Does anyone know what happened to him? If you do, please tell him HE NEEDS TO WRITE ANOTHER BOOK SOON!"
4,Not dead when I last saw him,"Enough people have commented on the book, so I'll go to the personal part. The rumors of Mr. Kun's death are bizarre. I went to college (Johns Hopkins) with him, and at our 20th reunion last year he was alive and well."
5,Terrific,"Somehow Sorcerer has never aquired the same popularity as the rest of the records by Miles' mid-60's quintet. It's a mystery to me - the compositions are sublime, the playing out of this world! A timeless, terrific record that catches the greatest jazz-band ever at the height of its powers. All the way up there with ESP and Nefertiti from the same period."
3,Dark & Moody - I second that opinion,"I wholeheartedly agree with the reviewer who called this a dark and moody jazz masterpiece. Miles kept churning out artistic works like this in the early to mid-60s and they are all delicious musical offerings. The drums dominate this recording. Trumpet and keyboard and bass all crawling out of difference corners, it makes me dizzy with longing and nostalgia. It's more daring than most rock music ! I think that's what he was shooting for."
2,pretty if you like Liberace style piano playing,"This is not a band elevator lounge album, in fact walk into any fancy department store and your likely to be hearing one of these dime a dozen painists playing next to the escolator! He's kind of like Liberace in his playing. Good elevator music!"
3,think i got a lemon,"Several years ago I used to own this exact Maglight, which I adored. So I ordered another to replace it. Well the on/off button on this replacement doesn't work so well. I believe that Maglites are quality products and that this one, even though purchased as new, might have sat around for too many years. Maglite stop making these purple ones years ago. Or I might have just gotten a lemon. My review reflects this particular replacement flashlight. Otherwise, Maglites in general receive 5 stars from me."
5,I LOVE PURPLE!!,"I am very pleased with my purchase of the PURPLE MAG-LITE. It was a great price at around $16, comes with an extra bulb, has an adjustable beam, and seems to be well constructed. I live on a canyon and was amazed at how far the beam of light travels!! AND IT'S PURPLE!!!"
5,A beautiful flashlight,"All houses need several flashlights, just in case. This flashlight is large and much heavier than cheaper ones. It is very bright and has two settings. And of course it is a beautiful dark shade of purple, so I love it. :)"
4,Ankle Bells,"I love this, but it is quite delicate, you must be careful with in when wearing it, perhaps it would have been better as a bracelet instead of an anklet. The service was great and it was shipped in a timely manner."
4,Nice .. but ...,"This is really cute, but what I got was not like the picture. I still liked it though ... the bells make cute ""ching-ching"" sounds."
2,Early book being reprinted,"I like most of Drake's books, but he wrote this before perfecting his style, and it was not very memorable. Fine if you are stuck on a plane, but not in the same class as Redliners or Forlorn hope."
4,Medical Terminology,"I found this to be the perfect book for me. It has a brief description of the meaning of the word and its translation. I use it all the time for medical translation. Not all words are there as far as pathology, but it will do."
2,Avoid confusion!,"Every review in this section seems to be referring to the Bruno Mattei movie Night of the Zombies. This product, however, is a movie of the same name directed by Joel M. Reed. It has nothing to do with tropical island zombies, but rather WWII-era Nazi zombies! NOTZ (get it?) is about a CIA special-agent investigating deserters from the U.S. Army Chemical Corps unit. Once in Germany, he uncovers a plot of world domination involving...Nazi zombies! This movie is terrible, but in a good way. I suspect an updated version could be done much better, but if you like cheese you'll appreciate this one."
4,SHIFT YOUR ASS!!!,"This entry into the zombie movie hall of shame is worth viewing a few times. The zombies are the italian purple and red kind for the most part. The acting is horrible, the plot is that of Dawn of the Dead, the soundtrak is stolen from Dawn of the Dead, but it's a worthy try at a ""good"" zombie flick. But, weirdest part of the movie: The journalist lady gets nekkid to go into the tribal village in Papua New Guinea, then gets makeup on out of nowhere while stock footage is edited in with no remorse! It's a weird Natl Geographic gone horribly wrong."
3,A great cheesy horror movie!,"This movie is great if you're in the mood for a 'light-hearted' horror movie. It's got lots of action, gore, and excitement!! Get a group together and watch it for fun."
2,I love zombie movies but.............,"This movie was bad. As much as I hate to bash any zombie movie, I found myself fast forwarding through it. I have never done that to any movie. Somehow the director took a good story line and (messed) it up.What&#65533;s up with all of the stock jungle footage? The coolest part of the movie is when the girl gets naked.And that is not all that. I&#65533;m giving this movie two stars. One for being a zombie flick, and one because I like zombie flicks."
1,I'd give this zero stars but they won't let me...,"Being a fan of genre films (I think Fulci is brilliant), I have to say this is probably the worst movie of all time, bar none, no arguments. Sure, it's a slice of Italian cheese featuring the Italian monster of choice: the zombie. But even hordes of the living dead and millions of rounds of ammo being emptied out can't raise the pulse (or laugh quotient) on this sputtering junker of a movie. Vincent Dawn (who's really talentless hack Bruno Mattei) has to have been the most worthless director on the low-budget scene during the 1980's. NOTZ is inept, poorly written, has no likable characters. The CREATURE FEATURES print of this film is incredibly awful and looks like a 2nd-generation bootleg at best. All in all, a movie that will have you hating life long after the end credits have rolled. You've been warned."
3,Swedish Style,"Katrin Cargill never fails to come up with the goods. Her books are interesting and informative as well as containing good information and excellent photographs. This book covers exactly what the title said, however, I think I was looking for more ""Gustavian"" decorating and perhaps more detail on how to achieve it. I was not at all disappointed with this book and have enjoyed many hours perusing it."
3,"not so ""compact""",not quite as pictorial as I expected; but good general history. I'm glad though I read Compact History of Civil War: DePuy&DePuy first- gave me a foundation; not quite as much to digest.
5,The Civil War,This book is filled with illustrations of paintings as well as photo's of the time period. A great find for the civil war buff. It has a index of battles and units that make it a fun for anyone who needs a good resource of information. It is Hard bound and is a large book. I have the book on World war 2 and Love it also.
3,"DANFORTH'S OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY, 8TH","This book is not like an ordinary medical textbook. It is more like an intermediate type between a medical text and a medical periodical. It gives considerable space to progresses of many medical-scientific research and the names of their authors. While on the other hand, it provides extremely concise outlines of etiology-manifestation-diagnosis-treatment for many common diseases, sometimes even skip certain important topics. As far as I am aware of , the following common topics are not or barely mentioned by this book: physiological changes of pregnant women; rubella infection during pregnancy; breast feeding of mothers with mastitis; the route and rate of mother-child transmission of HIV; the differential diagnosis of ruptured ectopic pregnancy; contraindications of the use of IUD; forceps use in labor; APGAR; There are also quite a few mistakes in the rear index."
5,a little something for everyone,"This is a wonderful book. Witty, charming and somehow welcomingus in its world. If you like stories you'll love these, if you're into creative writing definitely check it out."
4,I Can't Believe This,I read pages of this book on a site deciated to Michael Jackson and I couldn't believe what I was reading! Either Margaret is for real or just another bitter ex-wife of Jermaine's but if she's being honest in that book? then Jermaine ought to be ashamed of himself. The man's got issues and finally it's hypocritical of him that he's doing all those informicals to feed hungry children when he don't want to pay to have his own children fed with a roof over their heads and clothes on their backs.He's no longer with Randy's ex-girlfriend/babysmoma and has remarried I know but still if Margaret's telling the truth then I feel sorry for his current wife.
4,Smuttier than Latoya,"This was a good read, more smuttier than Latoya's and I don't know if I believe it all.but a good read I bought on Amazon used. worth the $ 10."
1,I was somewhat dissapointed,"Sounds like she was angry and only wanted to tell the bad things and it was not what I think she should have narrated in these tapes, because she lived with the Jackson's. Maybe she was mad because Jermaine moved on to someone eles. But I was dissapointed and look at the title, I bought this a couple of years ago and I had nothing nice to say about it then nor now."
1,"Left indelible ""racoon"" eyes","Maybe its because my skin is a little oily, but this product did NOT stay on my lashes at all - within 2 hours it was all underneath my eyes and looking awful. To add insult to injury, it is nearly impossible to remove from the skin without really scrubbing that delicate area under the eyes. I HATED this mascara.However, I must give credit to Almay as a company! They make a lot of other products that I like (the long-lasting eyeliner is amazing, and I can't live without the Bright Eyes cream shadow), so I wrote to them and told them about the problems I'd had with this one. They asked me to send the mascara back to them, and in return they mailed me a gift certificate so I can buy something else I'd like better! 5 stars for Almay customer service!"
4,I really liked the product. The mascara was ...,"I really liked the product. The mascara was easy to apply and it did make my lashes seem longer instead of making them clumpy. The only problem was that it was difficult to remove. But I found that if I use an eye makeup remover, the product comes off very easily. I'd recommend it to my friends and family."
3,Dated Police Drama,"In the wake of the Knapp Commission hearings that rocked the NYPD director Sidney Lumet produced two masterworks on police corruption, ""Serpico"" and ""Prince of the City"". ""Report to the Commissioner"" is nowhere in that class. My problem with the film is that the script by Abby Mann and Ernest Tidyman takes a somewhat cynical, almost hostile, attitude towards the police brass. The bad guys prominently wear the black hats and the good guys...um...there aren't many good guys on display here. There is a memorable standoff in an elevator at Saks Fifth Avenue between a green detective(Michael Moriarty) and a black narcotics dealer(Tony King). Yaphett Kotto gives a noteworthy turn as a black detective who laughs off the systematic racism he confromts. Regardless, a missed opportunity. Sonny Grosso, who along with Eddie Egan were prominent in the French Connection case, appears briefly as a detective."
5,See the light! Maglight!,"As a contractor for the ultility industry I rely heavily on this light to accomplish a variety of tasks.Lightweight,excellent battery life,weatherproof and just about as indestructable as it gets! A variety of accessories lets you change the colour of the lights beam and can be easily worn on any belt with the Mag-light holster(many sizes available to suit the size of light you need).You don't wear a belt you say?They make a keychain light that is excellent too!You have no excuse not to buy one! I have these lights everywhere from my toolbox,car,gardenshed to the fuse panel in my house.Its great for camping too.Just undo the Mag's adjustable head and place it at the base of the flashlight and you have a portable electric candle.The spare bulb in the tailstock ensures you will always be able to ""see the light""."
5,"Blue or purple, it is still a great heavy duty flashlight","I bought this flashlight, based on my experience with Mag-Lite, to use as a dependable emergency flashlight for my car. It fits the bill. I have one in my other car too. If you're concerned with the color, it is actually bluish/purple, not exactly the shade of purple indicated in the flashlight's picture. Don't blame Amazon for the error, the part# is correct and information insert from Mag-Lite indicates it is supposed to be purple. The price is right though for an excellent reliable product, whether it is black, blue, or purple."
5,FLASHLIGHT,I love the color of the maglite and also the same functions of any maglite. The flashlight was shipped on time and in great condition.
3,Retro color on retro design,Its old technology but it works. And it doubles as a weapon..I recommend some nightstick action. Or maybe unscrew the bottom and with a flick of the wrist you can launch 2 deadly battery missles and an attackers face. Id say upgrade this with the 3 watt lead or just get another brand if you dont HAVE to have a purple flashlight like my gf.
3,"Maglite ""Purple"" Flashlight Not really purple.","The flashlight I recieved was really much much much more blue with a tinge, maybe, of purple. I don't know if they messed up or what but the flashlight isn't really purple. It also was a very weak light stream, could have been the batteries though."
1,Purple Mag 2-D Flashlight,I was extremely dissapointed because I ordered a purple Mag 2-D flashlight and you sent me a blue one. I still want a purple one if you have any of them. I sent the blue one back and I think you credited my credit card. I still want a purple 2-D flashlight and would appreciate your contacting me if it is available. The internet said that it was.I also ordered a purple Mag 3-D and I received it and I love it!!! It is totally awesome!!!! Took it on vacation with me in the van and it came in handy more than once!!!! Thank You~!! Thank You!!! Thank You!!!Janet J. Southards
5,I just had to say...,"When I saw the first review I just had to say that I did the same thing. Except the copy I ""borrowed"" was the first printing Cardinal did in 1952. Only half of my copy is intact and I think it's time to get a new one. Very worthwhile."
2,Not as good as some people think,"I didn't like this book. Maybe I was expecting too much, based on some other reviews. The plot line was OK, the children of the romantic leads added some interest, but here's the thing:the heroine spends the entire book just exhausted by her strenuous position in the admissions office of a private school (!!). Honestly, she is the most tedious woman! Just tired, and defeated, with no clue about her daughter. I lost interest in her right away, and skipped about the middle two hundred pages of the book. If you're looking for something comparable to the humor and engaging heroines of the books by Jennifer Crusie, or Suzan Elizabeth Philips - don't pick this one!!!"
1,"Boring, boring boring",I am very sorry I bought this.The stories were painfully executed and boring. I am not so sure what is classic about these stories either.
1,New Age Drivel at its Worst,"Sloppy, sappy, insulting to the intelligence, having nothing to do with faith and everything to do New Agey feel-good imagery, spoken by a syrupy voice with bad diction, backed by gushy-morphy synth chord music and a singer who sounds like an out of tune 9th grader. If you are at all interested in cultivating real faith (regardless of the tradition) PLEASE take the time to read something with some real substance (the work of Father John Main and Eknath Easwaran's excellent book ""Meditation"" come to mind) and don't waste your time and money on this nonsense!"
3,Shop around,"Item purchased as a gift, I rec'd it yesterday today it is discounted by 50%,Amazon & their resellers should credit any sale back to purchase if it occurs within a short time of purchase."
3,Not like older Bentleys,"This book is informative on many things, just like the bentleys for the older cars. These newer versions just do not go into great detail like the older ones did. I was a little disappointed in that considering that's the main reason I got this. I always get a bentley for a car I have, this one is definitely the least informative of all the ones I've had before. Still good to have around though for some things, but not exactly great for in depth problems."
3,Read Carefully and look at the picture,"This product appears to be well made and would work on a window with wooden frames protruding outside. This is not for inside attachment at all. So if you don't have a window ledge outside of your window made of wood,it will not fit properly. I am waiting for a friend who needs it, because it really is a good strong well made product."
4,Great dollhouse!,"I purchased this dollhouse for my 3 yr old daughter for Christmas and she loves it. The house itself is very sturdy and the swivel feature makes playing with the whole house very easy. Also, the roof comes completely off which is great! It was fairly easy to assemble but no directions came in the box - we had to look them up online. Overall, a great dollhouse for the price, when you consider 4 people and all the furniture comes with it."
5,A great dollhouse,"I was searching online and in catalogs for a dollhouse for my 4.5 year old daughter and it was a hard to see which one was best. After visiting a few toy stores, this was the winner by a mile. I find a lot of the plastic dollhouses cheap-looking and ugly. The other wooden dollhouses (i.e. Melissa and Doug Deluxe Wooden Dollhouse) are extremely plain inside; there is no color at all. This dollhouse has colored walls and came with everything you need - furniture and dolls - and even a lazy Susan to make it easy to turn the dollhouse around. It looks to me like KidKraft has discontinued this model, and I'm very sorry to see that. Their Savannah dollhouse is WAY too big for my house, and the colors on their ""Glamor Girl"" house are more garish than the pretty tones on this winner. I'm really happy I bought this dollhouse, and would recommend it to anyone."
5,Happy Home,"Fast delivery, easy to put together, all dolls and furniture included, great price, well made, and super cute. My daughter loves her first doll house."
3,Quality control,"I love the look and size but after the first use, a crack appeared on the enamel. I have a larger 5qt DBK braiser which I've used much more often and so far no cracks on that one. I guess consistency and quality control on these pots are a little spotty. The price was really low so I guess you get what you paid for."
5,Great book for pre-schooler. I love this book!!,"A car ride with my three-year-old consists of endless inquiry...""What's that sign say? What's that sign say?"" It all started with ""No Outlet"" and we are currently stuck on ""No Trespassing.""This book is a huge hit, there is no way I could have predicted how much my child would like it! Not only are there are a lot of familiar signs (road construction, no parking, speed limit) but there are quite a few new ones that caught his attention. My son spends a lot of time on each page asking about the sign and spelling the words. If you have a sign-obsessed preschooler, this is the book for you."
4,kirby fan assembly,My old kirby is sucking again thanks to the fan assembly.Easy to find model numbers fast shipping.I have 3 other vaccums including a rainbow none compares to the power of the old kirby.
2,good,"its something fun to have. When offroading, it bounces around a ton and the numbers/lines stop far before you get close to flipping (at least in my jeep). Also, this whole unit swivels on the stand it comes with, so if you touch it, the fore/aft zero is thrown off. which is fine if you're driving to the mall. But not out in the sticks where you're almost never on level ground. Basically, this is something cool to look at. It doesn't do anything for offroading though, I took mine off after a couple trips to Mt.Ranier."
4,Loved this,"the Nero Wolfe stories in this collection do not disappoint the reader, they are a very good read. Very thankful for the entertainment, renewing my love for reading."
2,Three more inferior wartime Wolfe stories,"Rex Stout had important duties in World War II, so he apparently couldn't devote much effort to the first two of the three stories here, and it shows. (It also shows how much effort he put into his better stories, something his imitators don't seem to manage.) The third, set shortly after the war, is less bad, but still weak. As (minor spoiler) Inspector Cramer notes, the murderer is an idiot, which is how Stout got the plot to work. But it has certain points of interest for completists; the tone is slightly coarser and more real than in most of the other Wolfe stories."
5,You won't regret buying this book.,"After borrowing this book from the library I realized that it is so full of helpful information that I am going to buy it to have it in my small home shop. I was surprised to see only two reviews so far for this book: The writing is clear and concise; the diagrams are very helpful. The only thing that I wish for is better photography. Don't get me wrong, the photos work well to support the text but they are some times ""muddy"" black and white images (I'm a photographer so I tend to be picky about this sort of stuff.). I am relatively new to joinery and find this book one of the best I've read - and I've read probably close to fifty woodworking books in the past several months.If you are new to joinery like me I think you'll find this book one of your best tools.Have fun."
3,not bad but not exactly what I was expecting,this is a fine book if you are looking for constructing a house using Japanese type joints on your wood. Maybe it was my mistake but I was hoping to get more joints used on furniture rather than house building.
4,nice read,"I really enjoyed The Yellow Room. It was a bit slow at the beginning, but it is well worth the time. It is interesting to see another perspective on the second world war, since most of the books I have read have been by British authors. I will definitely read more of Mary Roberts Rinehart."
3,A real Princess,"I missed this movie when it came out:the resulting character is sort of a cross between Grace Kelly and Princess Diana. For men this blond bomb shell is a disaster.She pretty much has her way with life,and finds that what she thought she wanted wasn't exactly what she really needed?The two male actors are great and I think better than the star Julie Christie. The screen play is right on and seems to naildown this sort of popular woman."
2,Cutting out the charm and character...,"This MGM Home Video version of Darling (#1005693) is not a full version of the film. It was enjoyable but rings of media puritanism. A number of defining scenes, albe-them mildly risque, are missing. This is cultural and historical bleaching. We must discourage companies from ruining films. Do not buy it. I am now out the money and looking for the full version on DVD."
4,Story of a poor little rich girl,"Diana Scott (Julie Christie) has just made the cover of ""Ideal Woman"" magazine. In a flashback, she recalls her rise to fame and fortune, beginning as a 20-year old would-be model in swinging-sixties London. She was beautiful, hip, and full of life, gliding easily through love affairs and joining the ranks of the upper class.Christie was so young and beautiful in this movie! Even with the black and white photography, she's luminous, dynamic, and, yes, darling. In her Oscar-winning role, she climbs the social ladder using Dirk Bogarde and Lawrence Harvey as two of her stepping stones; they're both excellent.The movie is such a product of it's time (1965) and puts so much emphasis on her trendy wardrobe that it seemed a bit dated to me. Also, there were a few scenes when I thought she hammed it up too much, but still I enjoyed her and the movie and recommend it."
3,Where's the (Yawn) Meat?,"Don't remember where i saw this classic film recommended, and i suppose it is somewhat entertaining, but really, an Oscar winning performance?? i am certainly a classic film fan, and enjoyed JC's other vintage roles in Zhivago and Far from a Madding Crowd very much. but for some reason, this seemingly never ending portrayal of vintage 1960's english moral decadence didn't do much for me. i think ALL the major actors in this film have done much better work elsewhere. after about an hour and a half, i had to force myself to finish watching it while still awake."
2,At least the sleeve art is cool,"I don't understand this new hardcore trend going on. I give this band props for sounding a little different, but really this is just a bunch of noise and screaming. ""Screamo"" or whatever the lable is. Plus all the songs sound pretty much the same. Pretty over rated stuff."
1,The technology is too old,"Maglites were once considered the best of the best, but that was over 20 years ago. The Surefire and Streamlight brands are quickly becoming a favorite of Law Enforcement Officers. Mags are just too big, too heavy and too dim. Get yourself an Arc or Surefire instead"
5,<3,"I love these books. They catch your attention and just dont let go. I have to first two books and am finally going to pick up the third tomorrow. I just read the first two agian in just over twelve hours, even after reading the books a million times before they still continously held my attention... deffanitly one of my favorite series!!"
5,Not just for teens,"I have to say I work in a library to begin with because if it weren't for my job I probably would not have picked up this book. But when I read it, it was wonderful. This is just not a book for teens. It is a vividly written fast paced book that is almost impossible to put down. So no matter what your age is this is a must read!"
4,WOW!!!!!,This book is so good! I am a Venice fanatic and this book got to love it even more. I thought that brining a 21st century boy into a 17th world was genius on Hoffman's part. It was an awsome book.
3,Pretty Decent,"This wasnt the most wonderful book I have ever read, but still worth my time. The books storyline was quite appealing but the book just didnt have that extra something to keep you interested the whole time. My advice is to read it, because many people find it appealing. If you want my advice for and awsome series of fantasy books, read the wind on fire Trilogy. Now those books rock."
2,no scent whatsoever,The products included in this basket had no scent whatsoever. The box was taped together and falling apart. I was very disappointed in the extremely bad quality of this product.
1,extremely cheap and disappointing,"I received this as a gift. How could I tell my friend, who kindly sent it but could not see it, that it was so CHEAP looking. the body care products smell terrible and the quality is so cheap. One of the bottles was actually open. The cookies were dry. The tea was bitter. A terrible nightmare. What a double disappointment - to open this on my birthday morning, and then to try not to disappoint my friend when she called to ask if I had liked it. DON'T buy this!!"
4,Really bad--everybody borrows and no one returns,I'm a boy scout leader. I own a few of these. The thing about these is that everyone likes them so much that they always want to use them. I end up passing mine out and ending up with one less. I must be their best customer. I always end up buying replacements.
5,"Now more ""juice""!","The fact that my battery can last multiple times longer on a charge is a no-brainer.Seeing the battery at ""full"" for a longer time than I'm use to was fantastic.Yes the battery makes the ipod a bit bulky and the charge time is longer but itdoesn't bother me one bit compared to the expanded amount of playing hours.Long as I can make less recharges than necessary it makes this purchase worth while."
1,Breaks in 2 years,"Since 2007 we have bought two and they both broke. The warranty is only for 1 year, but it breaks after a year and a half. I bought the second one, the same model since i have a frame for that, and that one broke after 2 years of normal usage (family of 3).Now it's better to change the frame and buy a different model; two failing w/in a couple of years is too much."
1,Fire Hazard!,"Just had a fire in my microwave last night. Not even worth one star,any suggestions on how to deal with manufacturer?I would like to amend this entry to say that through the Better Business Bureau I received fair treatment and compensation for the faulty product. Electrolux Liability Department saved face for this company, though it took lodging a complaint through the BBB to get communication moving in the right direction. I advise anyone wishing to pursue a claim regarding an Electrolux manufactured product, head directly for the Liability Department and don't waste time in customer service. The Customer Service Department is not equipped to handle complaints and the threshold for dealing with resolution is very low."
3,Nice book!,I liked the book for my students to see how writers use information. I would have liked for it to have more for the students to see about writing but it is a good book.
1,Total Waste of Money,"This book is absolutely useless. The information provided is not connected in any relevant way to the Series 7 test and does not give any more insight into 'thinking like a stockbroker' than would a copy of Barron's or the Economist. In fact, go buy the latest issue of Barron's, save $15, and get a lot more articles. You can feel almost immediately that this book was made simply to cash in on anxious Series 7 test takers. You do not need this book; it is an expensive and unnecessary way to acquaint yourself with information otherwise available."
1,I would give it 0 stars if possible,"This book doesn't discuss any strategies for passing the series 7, it basically consists of various investment tips from financial planners seems to be marketed more towards a person who is looking to invest."
2,Lousy Excuse for Train Trip across North America,"I spent $15 for this train trip across North America, being a nature lover. It crams a supposed ""trip"" across North America into less than 60 minutes worth of time. And in that short time, it ""travels"" in Alaska, from Quebec in Canada to Vancouver, from Seattle to Chicago, from New York to Miami, from New York to San Francisco, and finally from San Francisco to San Diego. Each of these trips take less than 10 minutes; and they spend too much time on commenting about the TRAIN itself, such as the passengers, the food, the chefs, and they spend little time on the scenery itself. Don't get me wrong: it has several spectacular shots of North America, but very few are included...if you can afford to be disappointed, I guess, you could give this a try. I simply was expecting more for my buck."
4,Worked for only 1.5 months!!!!,"I would have given this product 5 stars. Unfortunately, like a lot of the reviewers, mine also stopped working.I loved the subwoofer and the surround speakers were ok. Luckily, I took mine back to Toys-R-Us and they gave me my money back.I would purchase another exact system if I knew it wouldn't have the same problem.I definitely would not recommend this product!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"The darn thing just doesn't work! After the first week, it broke for no apparent reason. I took it back to Toy R Us and they woudn't give me my money back because I had thrown away the boxes, but they did exchanged it for another one. Two weeks later, the piece of crap broke too. What a rip off!!!!"
1,Only Worked Two Weeks,"This product was great while it worked. After two weeks, it broke. My mom is having trouble getting the manufacturer to honor the warranty."
1,This system is crap,I bought this system because I thought that it was the new Xbox 5.1 system that I read about on TechTV that won the 2004 CES best of show by Spherex Inc- www.spherexinc.com. It wasn't. What a piece of S***. This thing is not 5.1. It has no Dolby Digital/DTS Decoding. The speakers are cheap. It sounds horrible. It looks cheap. DO NOT BUY THIS. YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU GET!!!!!!!!!!
2,I have bought 2 and both sent back!!!,This system works great if you can keep it to work. But also ive recently bought 2 of these and both just quit on me. I could hear the sound through the headphones but not through the speakers. There is no reset button and i have no clue what do. Im now going to buy the monster game 5.1 surround to see how that works. If you get this i hope you can keep it to work and i never turned it up that loud so it was really weird why it just died :( Thanx
2,I don't see what the fuss is about,"Maybe i just don't ""get it"".... I bought this album after reading all of the glowing reviews it was receiving (...)don't get me wrong.... i love power metal..... i really like Stratovarios, whom Sonata Arctica is constantly compared to.... so i figured i'd also love this album.....i dunno.... while listening to this, i can't stop thinking that ""this has all been done before, but better"".....maybe i need to give this more time... i dunno.... the musicianship is stellar.... production is flawless... maybe the songwriting is the problem...... maybe it's the annoying and cheasy narrations used within this album that now seems to be appearing in almost ALL power metal albums......i'm disappointed.... (...)"
3,Not quite there...,"This was the 1st Sonata Arctica album that I heard, and being a huge fan of progressive rock/metal i was pleasantly surprised by the musicianship of the band. In some spots there are the doubled keyboard/guitar solo's that fans of Dream Theater and other prog bands will love. The rest of the band is very competent too, and vocalist Tony Kakko has a nice voice, albiet heavily accented.That being said, something about this cd doesnt quite do it for me. Maybe its the sameness of the rythym on all of the faster songs, typical Euro-style fast double bass drumming, maybe its the not-quite-cheesiness of the lyric/vocals (the lyrics arent bad, i just dont get what he is trying to convey).In all though, Silence is not a bad listen, just a bit different. Sonata Arctica definatly has their own style, something many other bands cant say."
2,Absolutely boring,"Maybe i've listened to too many power metal bands. This album bored me so much that i actually think that i falled sleep suddenly and missed the good part of it, i mean, there's nothing atractive in this album."
1,Disappointment,"I had expected more from the title. There are many brief case study illustrations but not really any sort of systematic evaluation and dissecting of the the criteria used in determining the desired brand and the target audiences. As the author states, B2B marketing and branding is often made up of numerous influencers and parties involved in the decision. He missed an opportunity to describe these various parties for the each case, the various parties involved in the decision, the key factors of concern for each party (e.g., warranty, serice follow up, etc.), and how the company went about addressing these in its brand positioning and marketing strategy. Instead, most cases are general overviews with little indepth analysis."
5,About This Book...,"A handsome 104 pp, trade paperback, with color and b&w; illustrations throughout.

2,COOL KOHL BLACK,"I received a deluxe sample of the Black Gold as a GWP. I was so excited to use, because the color is truly interesting -- unlike any I have ever seen.But I was disappointed.... here's why:1) The eye pencil is not effortless to apply. It is very soft, so you ahve to be careful or else you risk transference.2) The eye pencil is not smudgeproof or waterproof. Within a few hours, I had racoon eyes.3) Does not adhere to inner lid if you want to line the inside of your lid (great to make your eyes pop out)For the retail price, and Merciers excellent reputation, I'd expect more. I won;t be using this again, and am glad it was for free."
2,Pick a note...,Paige puts in an average effort in the British follow up to the 1987 New York production with Patti LuPone (who fits the role almost perfectly). Chorus work slightly shaky. Paige's accent is hilarious. Pick a note Elaine!
1,Tinpot Sound quality,"This CD sounds like its been recorded from a cheap seventies walkman. The recording sucks so bad, that my recommendation is to stay away from this particular piece. Its not even worth $1."
2,Looks cheap and fake,"Do not be impressed by the photo of the pendant. In reality, it looks cheap. Worth 10 dollars, not a penny more. :("
1,There's a MUCH better light out there,"No Maglite product can get a ""no star"" rating - they are very well built. However, if you want the best ultra-compact light, you need to look to the Photon Microlight or the ARC AAA light. They use LED's, and give, for all practical purposes, the same amount of light for many, many hours more than the AAA Maglite."
1,The color is the best thing...,"This flashlight design is more than ten years old. The biggest improvement in that time (as for all maglites) is the range of colors on offer. Otherwise all the torches are pretty much the same. Meanwhile, the rest of the world has moved on with brighter bulbs, shockproof designs, better battery life.So while this was once cool, now it is just another torch in a pretty color. The light is dim, has funny shadows in the beam, and the bulbs break.I'd recommend looking at a different torch, e.g. the ARC AAA."
4,Maglite is a good buy.,"I have a maglite on my keychain. I forget how old it is, but almost all the black paint is rubbed off leaving bare metal. It still works on the original LED. Sometimes the twist-switch gets gunked up, and needs cleaning, but it mostly still works like new. I can't think of any design improvements."
1,Really disapointed !,"Poor beam, not even and weak. Twist to open/off. Seems difficult to turn it on/off with one hand. I don't think in an emergency everybody can have both hands to turn this flash on. When you get a focused beam then the head can pop off to become a candle light. I don't like this idea.High price, low run time. Different color got different price. Ridiculous!I want to use it to to light up the laser marked chips. It did the job poorly even my $1 cheap flash from Fry's can light up the laser mark for me to read. I'm really disappointed and don't know how to deal with it.Ben"
5,Judge me by my size do you?,This little flashlight is indispensable. I have lost count of how many times it has proven itself useful. It is very small and works well as a keychain. We trust our eyes above all senses and are the most awkward when that sense is taken away. Having a compact and powerful flashlight with you is a big help. You never know when you will be left in the dark but at least with this you can always be prepared.
3,flashlight,they r nice. i have had them before but i do have a problem with the top unscrewing and looing the bottom end but they do make really nice lighting
2,Buily well light is useless.,"It is well built like a maglite should be and well that is where it stops.The light would great for filming a horror movie as it dim and does not light much at all.A candle and my cell phone put out more light.Maybe for a and extreme emergency backup,but can not see well with it and others can not see.The light should be LED and most likely would be better."
1,Poor illumination,"I've had my maglight for a few years, but I'm upgrading to LED. My maglite barely produces enough light to see anything. Very disappointing, especially for the premium price and marketing hype."
1,SOOOOOOO DIM,"there is not much to say about this light, it seems to be good quality and nice constuction on the outside but the light britness itself is absolutly terrable, its seems to be anywhere from 1-2 lumens horrable light output (get a fenix ldo1 same size and uses the same batery and 72 lumens)"
1,Depressing.,I own three of these. Only one is still functional. One was defective from day one. An embarassingly shoddy product. Avoid.
3,Quickly becoming a dinosaur,"There is a lot going on within the technology of flashlights recently. LED, Lithium batteries, focus bezels, etc. The Mini Mag has fallen behind a bit technologically, but is still a great little flashlight for minor emergencies NOT involving looking for criminals, terrorists or signalling for a chopper pick up. The mini Mag is perfect for a pocket or a ladies purse. The product is very durable and they are proven reliable. Don't get me wrong. I've depended on Mag lites of all sizes for years. But head to head , the Surefire brands have quickly surpassed Mag lite in every important aspect of flashlights - usable light power, size, durability and weight. The Mag light brand just aren't keeping up. And that's too bad for us who value product loyalty.The Mini Mag is a good value and I have several in the house and the vehicles. But they're being replaced by Surefires as they wear out.John Row"
1,So disappointed,"Are you thinking of buying this product? Be careful! This product does not use a LED light bulb though the description says it does.I ordered this product because I believed the description was right but I found it was wrong when I received the product. So I asked Amazon to replace it but they sent me the same product. The same product using an old type bulb! Though I asked them to send me a product using a LED light bulb, they didn't care about the bulb at all.I am very sorry I can't say that Amazon.com is a reliable seller any more."
4,Light when you need a see something small,"This rugged little light can, like other Mag-lites withstand a beating. I keep mine on my keychain and after several years and a battery replacement or two its still working fine. The lens cover does get scratched up over time, but it doesn't affect its ability to illuminate very much. This light is small, so it won't light up an aircraft hangar. It's made to light up small spaces and it does that very well. It uses a normal light bulb, and in my opinion they should have used a LED. Otherwise it is a very good tool to have on your keychain for those random moments."
3,Not Reccomended.,"This flashlight is OK in most situations, but only puts out 2 Lumens of light. I suggest getting a flashlight that has more lumens."
3,Average Par,"Flashlight looks good, feels good, nice weight, adjustable beam but the intensity of the light fairly weak. Seems too weak, especialy with the available LED flashlights. Nicely built, but a bit weak."
5,Typical MAGLITE excellence!,"This is a great little light for the purpose it was built. As a keychain light it's brilliant, literally and is lightweight and solid. It illuminates a doorway very adequately at night and is handy around the car as well. I would not be without it."
2,Antiquated technology.,"I guess I'm used to LED technology at this point... this light seems well built (which is why I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1), but the bulb is super dim compared to my cheaper LED flashlights, and when you widen the beam the light is very uneven. It just eats up batteries. I won't be buying any more flashlights that use incandescent bulbs."
2,I don't get it...,"I still don't understand how Maglite can make such GREAT flashlights, and yet make a horrible single cell key chain flashlight. I have used Maglite products for years. They are incredible sturdy, and yet beautiful to behold! I've tried to tell them, but they don't seem to listen, or care. I keep buying them, thinking they'll get better, but they don't. Like others have said, they aren't very bright and they use power rapidly. And they flicker. I really do want a small flashlight for door locks and the like, but this definitely not it. DO BETTER, MAGLITE!"
1,Beam very faint - not a quality light,"I normally find Amazon ratings on a product useful. I bought this based on the high ratings of these reviewers you see here. Unfortunately these reviews did not at all match my experience. There are a few reviews indicating the weakness of the beam. These are the valid reviews after my testing for the last two moths. I replaced the packaged batteries originally thinking that no flashlight would have such a weak beam. You turn the tip of the light to turn on and off - you can focus the beam by turning it further, but at no time is the beam of sufficient power. I have used smaller flashlights with far stronger luminance."
3,Sturdy construction but not no LED,"My The Solitaire held up for several years on my keychain but I have recently replaced it with a Fenix L0P. The Fenix L0P is smaller and an order of magnitude brighter at 30 lumens. The Solitaire is only around 3-5 lumens depending on battery strength. The Solitaire can take a beating, but it is a dated design that can not compete with newer LED competition."
1,Don't get this -- Buy a little bigger one and you'll happier,"I have purchased THREE of these. Each one eventually, somehow, unscrewed in my pocket or purse and all I had left was the cap attached to my keys.The larger one I've had in my car for FIVE YEARS. It's excellent and I only changed the batteries ONCE and that was because I thought of it (but it was still bright).Do yourself a favor; buy the larger one instead of multiple tiny ones. Maglite is a great product, but they slipped with this one. YOU MAY REALLY NEED IT SOME DAY!"
2,Not LED bulb,"Great flashlight, nice and compact so ideal for what I purchased for.Despite the specs on the page I order from, the bulb is not led, which came as a bit of a disappointment, further reading after it's arrival shows solitare is apparently not listed as an led model on maglites website!Be Warned!!"
2,Very poor light,"I gave this 2 stars because it is a nicely built flashlight. However, it is a flashlight, and the purpose of a flashlight is to shine light onto things so you can see...at this, the Solitaire performs poorly.Even with a fresh battery, it have a weak beam. It's simply not worth it, even for half the price. It just doesn't work well as a flashlight.I've had this light for 5 years now, and I've never used it because it's so bad. It's the only flashlight I own that I don't use. Thankfully, it was only a Christmas gift."
3,"Good light, but limited uses","This light is decent for the cost and what it does. I keep mine in the car in case I need to fumble around in the seat looking for something.Beyond that, the light is really limited though."
3,Rugged but Dim.,"I have long been a fan of the durability and reliability of Maglite products, and this little light is no exception. The only real issue I found with it is that compared to any number of inexpensive LED keychain lights available these days, the light provided by this Maglite AAA is woefully inferior. If you are looking for a small light for your pocket or keychain, I would suggest you instead look at something like the INOVA Microlight instead."
4,Insight into first hand reports,"Very interesting and touching compilation of a lot ""historians"" from different era's of the black death starting in de 1300's, but the plague over the centuries. It is amazing how fast the spreading was in villages and a lot of people also died of starvation because life simply stopped in the area. It makes you wonder this was not just spread by rodents, if at all. It seems more like a gas or airborne virus."
3,"Great big band, Watrous also great but over-miked","Bill Watrous has always been one of my favorites, so I was greatly anticipating this long-overdue big band release, roughly 25 years since his classic albumns on Columbia. The charts and quality of the band here don't disappoint, but unfortunately, Bill's buttery sound is simply too muffled. It sounds too much like a baritone and too little like a trombone. It just doesn't compare to the Columbia releases from that perspective. It's too bad because the awesome technique is still there, if a bit too much--his solo throughout the final cut is almost exclusively 16th notes. The cadenza, however, is a real highlight. Overall, fun, but a bit disappointing for one very familiar with his Columbia and Famous Door releases in the 70's."
5,BEST MUSICIAN EVER!,Buy this album! You will love it! It is Bill's best album on CD format! You won't be disappointed. There's an amazing cadenza on this CD that is truly the best EVER.
5,Moving tragedy,"One cannot recommend this book too highly which has been written with a true feeling for the Cheyenne Nation. As I read the book I felt that I was part of those unfortunate people, whose only crime was that they wanted to live their own way on their own land. Any student of Native American History must add this to their library."
2,Worked great - but only for 12 months,"Loved this toaster oven for its versatility and large capacity, until it stopped toasting after 12 months of moderate use. (Funny, within a couple of weeks of the warranty expiring.) The top heating elements no longer heat up; still seems to bake, but that's not what I use most often. This replaced a Black & Decker toaster oven that worked for close to 10 years. I would hesitate to buy another Rival product."
2,"Okay, but a couple problems","I really liked all that this toaster oven does. It's great to be able to bake a few cookies at a time. It doesn't cook them as well as our full size convection oven, but it works well enough. The time you save over warming up a full-size oven is wonderful!Like many other reviews, we also had problems with the temperature knob being stuck. That started when it was about a year old and got progressively worse. Last week, the oven simply quit heating on the top, so now it's in the trash. I wouldn't recommend this oven unless and until the manufacturer fixes this obvious and recurring defect. Aside from that, though, it would have been quite good."
1,the dial sticks beware,"This toaster oven is a piece of crap. At first it was ok, It did take some getting used to. I mean you have to barley move the toast selection dial or your gonna burn the toast. But the real problem is with the tempeture control knob. Aftyer about 2 weeks the knob started to stick. It was impossible to move until it heated up for awhile. Last night I made some tater tots and forgot to move the tepeture control back to toast while the the oven was still hot. So this morning when I wanted to make toast I had to deal with the stuck dial. It was ugly. I wound up taking the dial off and attempted to turn the selector with a pair of pliers but the dam rod was round and I could not grip it. I flew into a rage and just chucked the thing where it belongs, in the garbadge. What a way to start your day huh? Fighting with the toaster over."
1,Don't buy this oven,"I bought this a little over a year ago based on very good reviews. I was very happy with it, especially the ability to cook a 12 inch pizza. Then the oven door spring broke. I have googled and googled, and there does not appear to be any way to fix this myself. I don't see any parts available. I am certainly not going to send it in to get fixed. Looks like I either need to jury rig it, or throw it away. Based on the fact that several other people have had the oven door break and it doesn't appear to be easily fixable, I could never recommend this oven to anyone."
1,Lasted 13 Months,The heating element lit up like a light bulb as it melted and twisted and then quit. I'm glad it didn't catch fire. The oven made it past its projected life expectancy (the one-year warrantee period) so I've got to find another. I won't be purchasing this model again.
2,Usable toaster oven until timer quit.,"Got the oven as a house-warming present. Never had a toaster oven before so was quite pleased to receive the gift. Using it as a toaster, it never worked well. Inconsistent. And two years later, I know know why. The timer is the weakest link. A toaster oven in general is great for a one-person household. It reheats pizza incredibly well. I never knew how awful reheating pizza in a microwave was until I got to use a toaster oven.Pros: in general, a toaster oven reheats many foods to a much better state. Large size. Fits 12"" pizzas and included a pizza pan. Two racks. Crumb tray pulls out the front.Cons: the timer died in about two years. Parts are non-existent. Due to the timer, toast was a challenge. Door does not have a stop other than the handle. It sits on my microwave so it can open too far.Anyone know where I can get a DKJ-Y-60 timer in the States? Didn't think so."
1,Terrible Toaster Oven~ way too big & died in less than 6 months!!,"This is a VERY large toaster oven, yes it can hold a 12"" pizza but it can't cook it. The pizza edge furthest inside was burnt and the edge near the door was un-cooked & gooey.As if it wasn't large enough, the legs for this toaster oven make it a counter space nightmare. As previous reviews mentioned the knob sticks (for me it was the timer and needed to be reset or turned back then forward to ding the bell done and turn it off).Finally... not even 6 months old and it is DEAD. NO HEAT, NOTHING works and it is in the trash."
2,Worked for 1 Year 4 Months...,"I purchased this unit because of the size and mostly favorable reviews on Amazon. It worked fine for the past year and four months. I am a single man, so it does get used instead of my large oven, but I would not say I used it more than say, a family with kids. One day I noticed the unit did not shut the coils off after set temp was reached. It did get hotter than normal but it did not melt any cords or anything that crazy. I turned it off and tried to test it the next day. The coils do not heat up, and you cannot hear any ""clicking"" when the temp dial is turned. It's definitely the thermostat control that died. I doubt it had more than a year warranty, so I'm out $80 on a Rival oven. Won't do that again."
1,Same issue as others have had: controls stick,"I don't know what to do with this thing. The toaster time control is stuck and it very difficult to move. Normally when you move the toaster control to ""light"" or ""dark"" the toaster oven ticks down a certain timeframe, then dings that it's finished. There's no ticking, no moving of the temperature control button, no ding, and your toast burns every time. This item was very barely used, though I did store it safely and in good packaging for a year. Shouldn't be happening!"
2,Nice while it worked,"This toaster oven was perfect for a year. Then, as others have mentioned, the temperature dial started sticking. After turning it too hard one day trying to unstick it, it broke. I took apart the unit to look at the thermostat switch. I really don't think I am going to be able to fix it."
1,Temperature Knob Sticks,"Overall, I think it is a decent toaster, except for the main problem that is mentioned elsewhere here that the temperature knob sticks. Now, it is impossible to move until it gets hot. This is a manufacturing defect and the unit should be recalled."
2,I don't recommend this oven,"We are now on our 2nd oven and once again the temperature knob broke. Even after exchanging our first oven for another one the knob never really worked right. However, we got used to preheating the oven before being able to move the temperature knob. Although today it finally bit the dust and now I am going to replace this toaster over with a different brand. If it was not for the temperature knob I would recommend this oven. Although with it being a larger size oven, it does take longer to heat up than the smaller toaster ovens."
2,This Oven Is Not As Good As My Old One Was,"My other oven element burned out after about 6 years of daily (and sometimes 2 or 3 times a day) use. I loved the oven, so I searched for another one just like it to order.My old one came with 2 racks, this one only had one when I received it, but two were pictured on the side of the box.This one had been treated very badly before or during putting it in the box, because the handle was badly bent. No amount of bending, and twisting will straighten it.This oven also doesn't heat as it should. You have to set the temperature at least 50 degrees higher than the setting you really need.Bottom line......I will not order another Rival product."
2,Don't waste your money on this item!!!,"I've had this oven for about 2 years. I was satisfied with it until this morning when the heating element wouldn't come on. The fan did. I thought was toast was cooking until I looked at the oven and it was still cold. It did do a great job on pizza. If you're wanting to cook toast, buy something else. Considering the cost, I expected it to last longer. I don't recommend this item."
2,Beware of Sticking Knob!,I bought this getting a very good price but found like others have written the timer knob Sticks most of the time burning up anything you put inside like toast for example which defeats the purpose of a timer! It just burned up 2 corn muffins I Placed in it placing the knob on light toast. I went into the other room to watch TV and smelled something burning! I discovered the timer knob at OFF position but the Oven was still ON with the Light Lit. This is not the first time this has happened. If You just want this for baking and feel safe that this thing won't burn your house down go ahead and purchase it. I live alone with no kids so will continue to use it very carefully. My suggestion is not to purchase this regardless of the price. If It wasn't for the Poorly designed & dangerous knob I would give this 4 or maybe even 5. Beware..
4,A Great Movie,"i Thougly enjoyed this movie, espesially the proformances from the actors. All the reviewers of this film have praised Wil Wheaton , Brian Kruase , Soleil Moon Frye and Jennifer Burns and i agree they were really terrific in this film. But i also like to mention Aron Eisenberg's and Michael Kudliz (spelt wrong) acting. They were both really good as well. espessually Aron. (he's my favorite actor)"
1,don't they have a ZERO star for this?,"This movie was so stupid I had to turn it off about 45 minutes into it. Everything that happened it that 45 minutes was stupid and dumb. Lets see, the girl was raped, then murdered. So many people knew about it but didn't say anything to anyone about the death. How realistic is that?"
5,Best Fountain Pen For Me.,I have tried and own several including Levenger and others. This is a nice sort of heavy pen that floats across the paper. I have arthritus and have to write a lot. This pen makes it posible for me to write neater and longer than any other writing divice. Of course I can't spell with a damn and my grammer is below C average but it is nice to be retired because I can tell you now that if you don't like what I write you don't have to read it.I also like the fine point.
