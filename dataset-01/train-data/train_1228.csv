4,Its a good book,"Its a good book for a person who wants to accomplish something, its the begining of Donald Trump it gave me a lot of encouragement I was saying to myself if Donald Trump could do this why could'nt I do it I might get as big as him, overall its a very encouraging book, there a passage where it says Donald Trump in his early times rented a studio apartment in manhattan and look where he is today, this book motivates you."
5,"Hilarious, inspiring business book.","I read a lot of business books. Some I read more than once, because they either contain great information, inspire me, or both. Some books do a great job of teaching substance-- great tips you can really use in your business or job. Some favorites in that category are Wizard of Ads, Swim with the Sharks without being eaten alive, Beat the Street, Complete Guide to Buying and Selling Apartment Buildings... and so on.Some books, however, are just inspiring. I find this book by Trump to be that way. So many people can't stand him, and it's hard to blame them. But I think he really shows how much you can accomplish with enough determination, confidence, and sheer audacity. I've read this book 4-5 times, and at the end I always feel like I'm not trying hard enough and that I need to get out there and do better."
1,Don't buy,"This item arrived wrapped in clear plastic with absolutely no way to prove it was from SERTA. The pillow looked fine at first, then I removed the covers to wash them and found the foam inside was all yellowed. (Not the yellow you expect but an aged yellow.) I also noticed that the zippers on both covers were extremely fraglile. Once you remove them you may never get them back on!If you are expecting a retail SERTA pillow in a retail box you are not going to receive it here. This pillow doesn't even have a SERTA tag!"
3,roy harper hq,this cd is just o.k. the game is the best song on it. roy harper was a great guitar player. but the game was the only song i knew on this cd. it is a great rock song with roy showing his guitar abilities off. the other songs on it are just average.
3,The decline,This was when I started to lose interest in Twice A Man actually. It is sad because they had great potential before and they would keep on producing great stuff from time to time.
1,Very Disappointed,"I was disappointed in the scale.It needs to be stored flat, so I can't store it sideways in the cabinet as I intended.The LCD screen is blocked by the bowl, and at an angle that makes it difficult to read.It does weigh in oz's, but not in lb's and oz's. Therefore, any item weighing more than 1 lb requires you to do the math.In order to return the item I would not be reimbursed for the orgininal shipping and I would have to pay to have it shipped to them. In other words costing nearly the cost of the scale itself."
4,It weighs food.,"It's a digital food scale that does exactly what you might think it does: weigh food. It's easy to flip the bowl upside down and stash the entire unit out of sight (like on top of a microwave/underneath a cabinet).The only downside is the auto-tare feature, which resets the scale to zero after a certain amount of time. This makes it difficult to weigh out small items like peanuts unless you drop them in all at once.All in all: a totally adequate scale. Great price.UPDATE (APRIL 2012):The scale is still working just as well as the day I bought it. I think I've replaced the battery once."
4,Compact and attractive,"I purchased this scale to weigh young kittens I was hand feeding. Unfortunately, it did not serve that purpose well because they were not still while on the scale. I could not get an accurate weight. I do see this as a very useful scale for anything that is not moving. It seems to be best suited for kitchen use in weighing food portions."
4,WOrks very well for the price,"Works very very well. Haven't had any trouble. The only downside is that if you have a large plate you can't read the display underneath, but I'm not sure what could be done about that."
4,Red Hot Marshmallow Squirters,"Yes, it's a cute story. Yes, there is a TV series, which makes my Book Snob heart wither a little.BUT...turn the pages to Max writing out Red Hot Marshmallow Squirters on Ruby's list in his very best handwriting, with his tongue sticking out, and you will almost weep for him.Buy it."
4,Best headphones ever,"Sound quality is phenomenal, and they are the only headphones I've ever owned that never hurt no matter how long I wear them. The external microphone is useful for airplanes (listening the the air crew), my motorcycle (stopping at gates), and other brief conversation scenarios. My only complaints are that the whole device is a bit clunky to workout with since a part of it clips to your pants and the microphone is a bit large to wear under a shirt, but it's not a big problem. And they are super expensive, but considering how tired I am of annoying headphones, even expensive ones like the Bose in-ear, I think it's a good investment."
5,Addictive,"Never been addicted to music until now. The sound coming out of these is simply amazing. Different length cables are awesome because I can avoid extra wiring hanging around.Strongly recommended.I had a couple of issues with them.1 - Some of the sleeves that came with the earphones were squeezed so hard in the packaging that they are damaged2 - The PTH device is bulky, cabling becomes a mess, and the battery door doesn't close right which makes the battery fall out a lot.I contacted Shure with my issues and they responded that they will take care of them. I really hope the replacement PTH doesn't have the battery falling out issue."
1,Nice while they worked,I paid $500 for these and treated them as such. They lasted three years until they began to short out and are now junk.
5,Fantastic sound,"I'm picky about my sound and after trying Bose, B&O and a few other brands, I figured I'd give the Shure's a try. The Shure's sound is very smooth and well-extended at both highs and lows, and although I was hesitant, I find the in-ear design to be comfortable for extended periods of time. Really, the sound is amazing - can't say enough about it. I do have two minor complaints: one is that I find I'm not using the Push-To-Hear module much - I probably would have just as happy to have skipped it. The other complaint is that the case Shure provides doesn't really fit the earphones, cables and so on very well."
5,great for studying,this product has helped me focus on my studies during the stressful midterms. i like to study w/ music on and outside noise just bothers me but i dont hear anything and i dont even have the volume cranked up. very good.
2,Expensive headphones you'll enjoy... but it won't last,"I bought the Shure SE530s earphones a year ago and was extremely pleased with the sound quality and their ability to cancel out surrounding noise. I travel a lot for work and the headphones worked wonders on canceling out all the plane noise and crying babies during long flights. Unfortunately, my bliss didn't last long, the wires on the earphones are now exposed on both earphones and the left earphone no longer works, basically rending them useless.I've tried to contact Shure via phone and email to find what the warranty on the Shure SE530s earphones. As of yet I have had no luck in even talking to a live person or getting any response to the several emails I've sent.Needless to say, because of this whole experience, I will never buy or recommend a Shure product to anyone. Yes, the sound quality WAS great; too bad you'll only get to enjoy it for a year, after that you'll be out $500 and listening to crying babies again during 8 hour flights."
2,Avoid the push to hear (PTH) Feature!,"I bought these for airline travel and have decided to return them.+ Noise suppression levels are pretty decent+ Lots of ear bud attachments- The awkward location of the PTH box along with the bulky inline mic is more hassle than having to take out the ear buds to hear. When everything is connected, your lap is filled with wires and the PTH plastic enclosure.- The PTH sound is tinny and the button to activate it is poor- The packaging is exceptionally wasteful. It's a series of cardboard boxes and foam inside a useless steel box that has sharp edges inside a plastic box inside shrink wrap.- The zippered pouch is nice except for the fact that it's to small to easily fit the PTH enclosure and the ear buds.I'd be inclined to replace these with the non-PTH version but the wasteful packaging is a deal breaker to me."
3,Um... Bass please?,"I feel like it doesn't have enough bass. This headphone is more for ""quality"" of sound, not ""quantity"" of sound, I suppose. Everything sounds EXTREMELY SHARP and CLEAR, that's for sure... but I personally wanted a strong bass, so it was a disappointment, considering this is a very expensive headset."
3,Nice but $$$,Nice compact earbuds that are very good sounding but a bit of an old style design for the price. I think the sound and quality are very good but the packaging and useability could be better. If you like buds they are great otherwise try the Bose Headphones.
2,High price + low comfort = unimpressed,"I had heard so many good things about these headphones that I just HAD to have them. Like so many other things in life, though, if it's not convenient and easy to use, it's often not worth it---that was the case with these headphones. They are not easy to insert in the ear and once in, are not particularly comfortable. That said, I realize that everyone is different---some folks are bound to enjoy shoving chunks of plastic in their ears; for those so inclined, this might be an interesting choice, except for the price and sound quality. My B&O headset is vastly more comfortable, easier to put on and take off, and has roughly equivalent sound quality for approximately one third the price. I didn't try these on the plane, since I couldn't get past the comfort issues and the weak sound; perhaps they are strongest in the sound isolation category. This was a disappointment for me and I returned it immediately."
2,When and why are we spending $500 on headphones?,"It should not matter how good they are, $500 for headphones that cost twice as much iphone 3g is a complete waste of money. If you make a million a year or more, I could see spending that on these, but thats it, and to top it off they are not even wireless."
2,They will break.,"I have used these ear buds for a year with moderate use. I leave them in the case when storing, and never tweak the cable. In that year, I have lost all sound in the left ear bud and I hear loud static from time to time. Additionally, and beginning at the unboxing era of the bud's life cycle with me, the PTH battery door would not close and stay shut. Simply put, for the money I had invested I expected something with better build quality and longevity. The drivers are great, don't get me wrong, and I would highly recommend these for the light occasional listeber who needs something for airline flights or long car rides. These are not for the daily listiner or anyone expecting these to last a long time.I did contact Shur to take advantage of their warrenty. They required hard to find forms, my credit card and other personal information. Additionally, the service rep I had on the phone was incredibly vague and rude. I will not buy from Shur again."
4,Shure Sounds Good.,"Played with your favorite DAC player and using FLAC tracks, the sound is immensely full and discerning for the fine parts. Brushes on the guitar strings will be heard. Handle them with care and they should last many years. I have had mine for nearly 3 years and no fraying. But even if a problem develops, if you have registered your product, excellent customer service to offset any problem that comes up from wear."
1,Nice try but too bad,"This guitar had all the right formula for being a wonderful blues guitar...UNFORTUNATELY the build quality and setup were so bad that this instrument (label used very loosely) was virtually unplayable.Everything buzzed from cone, and cover plate to the lugs ends of the strings where they passed through the tail peice and touched the body.The sound quality was very poor for a biscuit bridge resonator... very dull and soft with no bite on attack or sustain. The only saving grace for this guitar was that the action was ok. good for finger or slide although the neck was too narrow for slide work.I had to send this back... sorry On a posative note, AMAZON WAS GREAT ABOUT EVERYTHING!!!Good job Amazon... Very bad job DEAN!"
4,so easy,"I own the Pneumatic foreman pocket hole machine and i have to tell you that this is an amazing time saver. It is simple, fast and very functional. The only complaint i have is that the clamp doesn't hold the wood down as securely as i would like. i understand that the new electric model has a very secure hold on the wood. if you have an option between the two, i would go electric."
5,WHO SAID DISCO WAS DEAD?,"THIS IS A GREAT CD FOR THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE TO COLLECT 80'S HI-NRGDEN HARROW IS A VERY TALENTED ARTIST AND SINGER. THIS IS A MUST BUY CD FOR THE DISCO LOVERS, THIS CD IS PACKED WITH COOL MELODIC SOUNDS OF THE 80'S, ALL THE SONGS ARE GOOD SOME ARE BETTER THAN OTHER BUT NONETHELESS THEY ALL ROCK THE BOX, BUT MY FAVORITE ONE IS OF COURSE ""FUTURE BRAIN"". ""FUTURE BRAIN"" TAKES ME AWAY EVERY TIME I HEAR IT. AS I TYPE THIS, ""FUTURE BRAIN"" PLAYS IN THE BACKGROUND, ITS GREAT!! BUY THIS CD YOU WILL NOT REGRET."
5,A five star artist of 80s italo - dance,"I was very young when his first hits ""Mad desire"" and ""Future brain"" made him famous all over Italy and Europe; these were followed byother successful songs, like ""Bad boy"", ""Charleston"", ""Catch the fox"" and ""Don't break my heart"", which became quite as famous as the previuos ones and very much played and danced in the italian discotheques.Other songs of the CD, such as ""My time"", ""Holiday night""and ""Energy rain"" were unknown to me, but I've found them very exciting and full of rhythm. I think that Den Harrow is a talented singer and his songs are little diamonds of 80s italo - disco."
5,Good value,This cover works great and is very easy to install. I would recommend this cover to anyone looking for an affordable easy to use cover that keeps everything in the bed of your truck dry.
4,great!,"great movie, REALLY bad dubbing, REALLY bad plot, GREAT fighting. What we've come to love about kung-fu movies. Worth buying."
3,shaolin battles lama again and again.,"Lamas and shaolin battle it out, with some great styles, alot of blood, and some great fight scenes. Alexander lo reigh is great as a misled chinese lord trying to solve a case of betrayel and murder. you never know who it will be."
3,Funny as hell,"This movie is just funny. Memories of kung fu theatre on saturdays at noon rushed through my head as I watched this goofy romp. Ridiculous dubbing, an awful story line and some great martial arts action a la the old days of the genre. The choreography reminded me of a capoeira match where the fighters are just barely missing each other on purpose. I wish I could've seen it in the original cantonese or mandarin with subtitles as the films are always better. Worth watching if you love kung fu flicks."
4,hauntingly exciting,This book reads like a scary movie but its real. I couldnt put it down and i am now looking for more books on the subject. Realy scary at times.
3,Possessed or not!,I began reading it with much anticipation however was sadly disappointed when the flow of the story became disjointed going from past the present and back again. It was extremely hard to follow however the basic story was interesting.
5,This may be the best book I ever read.,I thought it had a real feeling to it the way he explained. Very Frightening. I found it to be the best non-fiction book that i have read.
3,Expected a Lot More,"Allen has written an adequate summation of the only documented twentieth-century excorcism. Stylistically, the book leaves a lot to be desired, however. The descriptions of the various nights of horror become a little routine, and some of the dialogue attributed to the young boy just doesn't ring true. I will admit to being somewhat spooked at times, particularly in the early going. Obviously, something happened to this young man, but I'm not sure at all what. Possessed is an entertaining read, but really nothing special."
1,Essential inaccuracies,"Perhaps the most important thing to know about this account of the ""true"" story that inspired The Exorcist is that the real boy in question did not live in Mt. Ranier. So all the facts presented here about that house, about those neighbors, or relating to that location - it's at best derived from erroneous sources, such as the early 1980's reports that first mentioned the abandoned Mt. Ranier lot, and at worst it's all fabricated. The real story can be easily found via Google searches. Knowing this, the rest of this account then falls into serious question, rendering the book virtually meaningless to anyone seeking the truth behind the Exorcist inspiration. It may make a good read, but it doesn't do much to present the true story. Try Google, and happy searching."
4,High entertainment value,"Whether or not Allen misses and distorts some of the historical information contained within his narrative, this work is still ultimately entertaining. It provides an extensive look at traditional demoniac psychology/experience, which is invaluable regardless of whether or not we believe in possession.It also provides an interesting look at Christianity's handling of demons and exorcism over the centuries, and even if there are historical inaccuracies, this aspect of the book is undeniably valuable.I am also impressed with Allen's style; he makes no attempt at sensational, horrific, ""scary"" language. It seems to me that Allen's goal is to provide an honest, impartial account. He leaves the reasoning to us.Whether you're a skeptic or a believer, this book has something to offer."
3,good nutrition but some bad advice,"There are a multitude of great recipes in this book. However, the author states things not to give your birds, ie sugar, and then includes recipes with sugar. I was also very disappointed to see the recommendation of adding Kaytee pellets to several of the recipes. Most Kaytee foods have ethoxyquin which is the worse preservative used and a known carcinogen. There are other brands out there. Was she paid by Kaytee to endorse their product?"
4,Cooking for my Grey,"This book is invaluable when it comes to the do's and don'ts for my Grey. It is very comprehensive and covers nearly the total spectrum of parrot must have and NOT to have. The portion devoted to foods not suitable for a Grey, is however, not marked clearly enough. This is a most important issue, and should receive more attention and a much more prominent place in the book. The various mineral elements, vitamins, etc. is covered extensively, and the scientific knowledge of the author is great, but this could be dealt with in less pages. The recipes are a great help and goes a long way to ensure a healthy, happy and good-looking Grey."
4,Good nutrition info,Lots of vitamin/mineral info. Almost too much but veryInformative. Many receipe ideas. Some I would modify forHealthier ingredients but gives a good starting point.Some receipes not very readable via kindle
5,Popped it into my Cingular 3125 and it just worked!,Very easy to use. I opened up the Cingular 3125 (HTC) phone and the phone recognized the card immediately. Now I have more then enough room for my mp3 files.
5,Flawless,"I ordered this card specifically for use with an older game console and it has worked perfectly. I haven't had any problems with it at all, so I'd say that this is a great buy."
1,Failed in service,I received the chip in a unprotected envelope and thought that wasn't to good to do that. I loaded about 2G music the first week but on the second loading it failed. On 11-17-2012 I got approval to send it back for replacement and mailed it back the following day. This is now 12-16-2012 and still no replacement or refund. I believe that this company suffered from the storm Sandy and hasn't got it back together yet.
5,Back-To Back Bumbles!,"This CD is hot! If you don't have it, go out and cop it. The CD has back-to-back knocks. Nitti is spittin about some real life drama, that street cats can relate to. I havn't heard a CD of this caliber in some time. I can't wait till his next release! Nitti, youv'e got a fan for life!"
2,bread givers,the Bread Givers has an interesting storyline but is hard to follow because of Yezierska writes in some broken english at the beginning of the book. though this is also something i like because it makes you feel as if you are in the time and place of the book. any one who enjoys historical fiction might enjoy this book. this book is about the classic struggle between a daughter and her need to make her own future and a the father who wants her to live his way.
4,Inside some of Jewish women in 20th century,"The Bread Givers takes place in 20th century. There were many immigrants. It was hard for old people to change their life, culture and tradition. I was angry with Sara's father (Mr. Rob Smolinsky) who always thought how to get money from his daughters. I admire Sara for her struggle and hard study in school. Sara shows us the life is hopeful and won't be dissapointing."
3,Just so-so,"While a very vivid depiction of growing up as a daughter of immigrants in 1920s New York, the book really loses steam about half way through. This is mostly due, unfortunately, to the fact that it relies on shock value rather than good writing or vivid description to carry the tale. I'm not sure I would reccomend it to anyone seeking an indepth and searching tell-all. It's something you'll read once, and probably never look at again."
4,Bread Givers,"I really enjoyed Bread Givers by Anzia Yezierska. It was a book that I felt that others might be able to relate to. Bread Givers was a riveting read that I did not want to have to put down. It answered many questions thatI had about Jewish Life in the early 1900s, but it left many questions unanswered. I would definetly reccomend Bread Givers to any one that is interested in reaidng a book about fairly new immigrents struggling to live in New York at the turn of the 20th century."
3,Bread Givers feeds the soul,"The Bread Givers reachs out from a dark and tragic past, is a timeless story of an immigrants story of transition from old world to new. The setting is the Lower East Side of New York in the early 1900's but it could be the story of immigrants coming to this country today.It is not great literature because of the tight construction of the story which is loosely written and easy to read but because it tells the tale of a young girl growing up in a family dominated by an autocratic father in a way that we feel her desire for a better life and we gather strength with her as she uses her experiences to achieve the goals she sets for herself."
5,ImmigrantExperience,"Often when in such a class, European immigrants are not thought of as having as much of a struggle. This book about an East. European family is very heart-wrenching and interesting."
2,A simple story written in simple language.,"This story was just ""ok."" It had little depth compared to many other great novelists of the 20th century. Most of the conflict is easily seen just by scraping the surface. It is, however, easy to read, and Reb Smolinsky does evoke some angry emotions from the reader."
1,Begging for Sympathy?,"Okay, I've read books about Family life and this one has little artistry. Sure it shows how a young jewish girl struggles with her life, but does it by begging for the reader's sympathy. Sympathy should be earned by showing the reader rather than begging for it. Harry Potter is a good example of that. Potter had a nasty homelife, but did he complain as much as Sara Smolinsky?No.If you want to read a good book on struggling families, read something like A Tree Grows in Brooklyn."
3,something more,"This books is ok. to read, but everything about family is very bad in this book. if it is your own family your religion your culture so this books just for better selling"
5,Transends Time,I first read this book in a Women's Literature course in college-but I never forgot it. Anzia Yezierska has a way of expressing age old issues for people [she focuses on the experience of a woman but it is more than just that]. I think reading this book would give one insight into oneself when the world's expectations clash with the desires of an individual to make her [or his] own mark in the word separate from history and culture.
5,"Necessary for School, but not Necessarily Unenjoyable","I needed the book for English 4 in college, but the book was not a slow read. If I had known it was that good, I'd have read it even if I didn't need it for school."
5,"Wonderful, inspirational book","This book is an amazing journey of a woman who is willing to have the courage to follow her heart and the more arduous, but more rewarding, path."
5,Not meant to spark a feminist movement,"This book is terrific! However, it was never meant to spark some sort of feminist movement. I believe the author's purpose was to inspire people everywhere to rise above those traditions and habits that keep them chained to a purposeless life. Inspiring! Written with great detail but not too much as to bore..."
2,Terry Dailey,"As an old friend and fan of Terry's, this is not his best work. It's songs he wrote while working at a radio station and while a few(such as You're There) are as good as those he played on his first album (which is hilarious), most of these songs simply don't make the grade. Sorry Terry."
3,"Yes, way overpriced","This is a beautiful short story of a timid woman's chance encounter with the outgoing little boy who lives across the street. July's perspective on life is original and she conveys so many ideas and emotions in such small space. The awkward connection between these two people of different nationality and generation and gender is tender and funny and moving. I give the story five stars. However this little booklet, while charming, feels like it was printed on a home computer and stapled together. Now that you can get this story along with 15 others in July's hardcover bookNo One Belongs Here More Than Youthe only reason to have this is if you are a collector."
1,Over priced,"This book is a pamphlet, it really is 7 pages and a picture of a back of a boys head. It is not worth $15 maybe $3 at most."
5,Superb album,"Just to counter the directionless rambling of the other reviewer for this album, I have to give this five stars. This is a fantastically varied album. After having owned this CD for countless years I still listen to this regularly. It is hard to classify, though, precisely because each song is completely different from the previous one. If you are aware of 'Interspecies communication', then this album might come as a shock. It is nowhere near as driven by electronics as that album, nor is it quite as danceable. It is, nonetheless, a fantastic trip to listen to."
2,Lucky People Centre,"I saw this on alt.binaries.mp3 and the song titles made me think ""christian"", like someone was trying to get me to download it so as to infiltrate my psyche and stop downloading mp3's.I wouldn't have ever realised they existed. Out of interest I listened.It's like the inner ramblings of someone on amphetimines.Bass, Energy, naive 1990's random clips mixed with in with pseudo-deep ragga.What a moosh-mush of styles.If you have heard of them, then you're probably buying based on the fact that you know someone who scored with them in a biblical or non-biblical sense.Either that or they were big in your country and not mine.Either way. I'm not going to buy much L.P.C :P"
2,Need to rewrite,"There is hardly much expository material on this topic without complex notation from line 2 onwards. This book is no exception. If the author wants to sell the book in significant numbers, it would be useful to write another book (based on this) for the applied economists. RATS has many helpful PRGs to solve the examples. The author may use them and draft his new book using these examples. Example EViews files will be also very useful. I wish this author all the bestEconometric Analysis of Panel Data"
4,Poetry Matters,"The book, Everything Writing Poetry Book is a practical guide for the beginning and a ready to publish poet. The best resource for where to send ones poetry. The text gives sound advice for the poet who wants to be published and is realistic about how little money is actually to be made in just selling poems. This book was more than I thought it would be. Check it out."
4,Gaming Edge Analog Controller for use with Xbox,"I received the product as described, excellent condition. This product handles just as well as the one that came with the game system, but differs just enough that you can tell them apart and not get confused if you need to alternate controllers."
2,2 songs don't make an album.,"21 year old Canadian pop singer Corey Hart released ""First Offense"" #31, in 1983. It produced 2 hits, the classic rock staple ""Sunglasses At Night"", #7 and It Ain't Enough"" at #17. Just really a tired 80's sounding album after those two songs. 1985's ""Boy In The Box"", was a tad better."
2,FIRST EFFORT,"Ok, i'll grant it to you...the one thing that first got me was the cute hunk looks of corey hart on the cd cover.But i was only 13...and the guy was so hot! it came as a pleasant surprise buying this cd a few years later and find out some songs were actually as good: the infectuos SUNGLASSES AT NIGHT (definitely a must of a song back in the early '80s...), the sweet IT AIN'T ENOUGH and the sensual lament of THE WORLD IS FIRE.The rest is pretty much early '80s stuff...The guy was only 22 when this was first launched on the market, but you must give him credit for being a complete, struggling and will-driven young songwriter from canada, maybe a little Sting-like voiced and The Police sounding, but definitely someone to watch closely over the years."
1,Saving Frustration,"I bought this game for my daughter and am very disappointed. part of the game is growing fruit for the other characters and it is near impossible for me so my daughter is very frustrated. But that is not the worst part of the game, the way you have to save is. When you go to save it gives you an eight digit code to ""Remember."" As if that is not bad enough, the code is not even alpha numeric, it includes pictures as some of the digits. How is a kid supposed to remember this code or even write it down to use it later? This is the worst game I have ever seen."
2,Game boy advance strawberry shortcake,"We bought this game and quickly resold it. The mini games were fun and the graphics were decent.....but we got stuck in the garden and couldn't figure out how to grow anything. So it quickly became ""boring"" as the kids say. Money would be better spent on another game."
4,great kids game,I bought this for my 8 yr old daughter & she loves it. There are a few places where she needs help but most of it she can do herself.
1,"SUCKS, SUCKS, AND SUCKS HARDER","I played this awful game on my friend's game boy and tried to see how terrible his sister's game was. this game fails in so many areas it's not even funny how bad it is.After playing this character I wish for a horrible bloody demise of her for torturing kids and hardcore gamers. I own Wario Ware Inc. for my game boy advance and those games are great, but this travesty of a game defiles those good times. The games suck, the missions suck, the sound and music are annoying as hell, the graphics are too bright and too colorful in many bad ways, and there's nothing good whatsoever about this form of torture."
4,An Opinion,"In response to the listener who may be dissatisfied or perhaps depressed - Mr. Byrne has not ventured so far as some may spite to believe. There is no replacement or even possible description for what the Talking Heads were. After the timely breakup of The Heads, (didn't they try to sell that sans Byrne?) Mr Byrne seemed to revisit his earlier trecks into pure composition. My point being: file this one with the subdivision including ""The Forest"" and ""My Life In The Bush Of Ghosts"". If you want to hear ""Rei Momo"", put in ""Rei Momo"".Enjoy your space..."
2,Better than lately...but far below his peak,"I don't know how he lost his way....those Heads albums and even his early solo work were soooo great! But at least this one show's a bit of a turn in the road and perhaps, if he stays on track, David will once again produce a great album! Until then we can only be marginally satisfied with his output....and look forward to his better Luaka Bop releases...by other musicians."
1,Painful,"I only downloaded Au fond du temple Saint, and I'm glad. Both vocalists ""slid"" to most of the notes, and it just got really old. Intonation was pretty poor, both tended to go flat. The musical expression was extremely bland, and I didn't like the tone of either vocalist: one seemed like he was bored to death and the other was having a hernia, I swear he was.Sorry guys, it's a beautiful song, and you just ruined it for me. Forever.If you read this, do yourself a favor and go with a time/audience proven artist, like Bjoerling or Pavarotti."
1,Puzzingly bad,"I don't know what I expected but certainly not this. Silly lyrics, pretentious style. I bought this CD based on reviewers' recommendations; this is a mistake I'm not likely repeat. Listen before you buy."
3,good but not great,"There's no denying Byrne's genuine talents both as writer/performer and as studio engineer. There's an almost too studied, larthargic mood to this CD however. The lyrics are great, his singing is good, but the musical presentation lacks energy and drama. It's not bad, just not memorable. I'd like to here him perform these live and I suspect it would be much much better."
1,Just not the same as before. Who's perception?,"I'm editing this review to state that my one star rating was more a reflection of my desire to hear something from a time past, from an artist that I admired and enjoyed. I apologise for my initial harsh non insightful review. I'm the reason Ricky Nelson wrote ""Garden Party"".Clinton Born II"
4,Byrne IS the man,David Byrne has to be one of the most talented and most original american artists. All of his solo albums are as good if not better than his work with Talking Heads. Thats saying a lot. This album was a bit of a departure but then again all of his albums have their own unique quality. My personal favorite is a tie between Feelings and Look into the Eyeball. This album's last track is the longest Byrne song I've heard and it's a masterpice unto itself. All of his solo work is a must. Buy and smile. You wont be dissappointed.
3,Thoughts...,"I'm not sure about the album, but I mist say ""Glass, Concrete, and Stone"" is an AMAZING song with unique instrumentals and lyrics. It truly is extraordinary."
2,I Guess I Just Did Not Want To Go In This Direction With David,"I have often been attacked for saying that David's early solo albums were as strong and consistent as his incredible Talking Heads albums, but I believe that. However, David has just been going off recently into areas I would prefer he not go. This last album was just not the David Byrne I have grown to love over the years. The songs are wishy washy and way too artsy. I am not desiring any Opera records at this point. David is a genius and has the right to go in any direction he wishes, but I regret following him on this one."
1,MCSE Test Yourself Review,"I purchased this book as part of a Windows 2000 Accelerated box set. After looking through it, I wish I hadn't. This book is poor, and cannot be trusted to reliably help you with your exam preparation, because not all of the answers are reliable. As an example, chapter 3, first question asks a scenario based question, with a required result and proposed solution. The actual answer it gives is that you should install AD client on NT 4.0 Workstations to connect to a Win 2000 server, and this can be obtained from NT 4 Service Pack 7. I don't need to study anything to know that client software ISN'T needed on NT4 Workstations for 2000 connectivity, and even if it were, there isn't an NT4 Service Pack 7 around to get it from! All in all, a pretty poor book, and I feel it's just a book thats jumping on the certification bandwagon to try and exploit the paying public."
3,nothing yet,I've been putting drops in my dog's eyes twice a day for about a month now and I've seen no change. She is still bumping into things and has cloudy eyes. Maybe it takes longer for the drops to work and if there is any change for the better I'll amend my review.......Well its been three months now and three vials of this product and my dog's eyes are getting worse. I wasted $70 and wasn't able to help my dog.
1,San Francisco,This video is totally overpriced for its content. I watched the video before and after my trip to San Francisco. VERY outdated...minimal information.
3,Shipped me one with a manuf logo on it,"So so quality. Would have been happy had it not had Rosa Regale logo on it. Adv. as a clear item. Quality is just so so.UPDATE - Buy with confidence from Amazon as they paid for me to ship it back. Still would like to have a solid clear one, but I guess you take your chances when you buy from Amazon Warehouse."
3,Interesting & thorough coverage of Judaism for Christians,"Harvey Cox marries a Jewish woman and learns a lot about Judaism. He does seem to have absorbed a lot of Jewish traditions and learning. The book will certainly be informational for interested Christians. I have three criticisms, however: 1) I never really understood Cox's theology. If Judaism is so great, why doesn't he convert? (He states several times that he is not interested but never really gives you a ""why I'm glad to be a Christian"") 2) He largely only gives you the liberal side of Judaism. No Orthodox or Hasidic rabbis are interviewed or read (with the exception of David Hartman, who is certainly on the liberal end of the Orthodox spectrum) I find this somewhat dishonest as Cox paints a rosy picture of intermarriage 3) numerous typos and errors (I never understand when people say the book is reviewed by experts and it comes out filled with errors)."
4,Impressive Debut!,"Although still well within my definition of formulaic, this debut novel in the Domestic Bliss series is also refreshing and entertaining. There were some unfortunate typos and the occasional bit of grammatical license that left my head spinning, but otherwise the book is competently written. The two main characters are somewhat stereotypical, but their personalities may take on more original aspects as the series continues. I like mysteries that may be classified as American cozies, and this is another fine addition to the genre. I look forward to reading the rest of the series, but hope the author takes time to describe the locale and expand her characters to make them more original."
2,TOO MUCH CHATTER,"There are many flattering reviews of CREATING FICTION on Amazon, but I find the book to be filled with friendly chatter that doesnt contain much instruction or helpful information. The one piece of solid advice in this book is Maxwell Perkins' suggestion to read WAR & PEACE several times and forget about how-to-write books."
1,Neither interesting nor helpful,"A decidedly uninteresting collection of essays. The essays are written in a sort of univerally vanilla style, which is maybe indicitive of how writing classes are taught, but which hardly gets the reader exciting about the writing process. The exercises are hokey, and may be of interest to people just getting started on the work of writing, but will most likely be useless to anyone who has completed a few stories. ""The Eleventh Draft"" and ""Why I Write"" are much more interesting, inciteful, and inspiring books about creating fiction."
5,Movie lovers guide,It may not be the definitive guide to movies and/or reviews but this readable book is fun! Any movie buff will relish the opportunity to check his/her own favorites against the authors; to bemoan the absence of a personal favorite; or cheer the mention of a forgotten oldie. A good addition to our shelves so thumbs up (pardon the reference to other critics)
2,You can do better!,"Received this book in a timely manner although it had San Diego Publiclibrary stamped all over it. So one of you out there has an overdue librarybook. Ha! Seriously, buy(used) ""The Very Efficient Carpenter"" by the lateLarry Haun or any of his other books or DVD's if you want to learn quickand efficient lay out and framing. This author wants you to think you are planninga shuttle launch. It ain't that complicated folks."
1,BUY THIS BOOK!,"buy this book, i read it and laughed the whole way through it, this guy proves you get what you pay for!! this would be an excellent book to get to see what you should NOT do. sometimes it helps to see what you shouldnt do, learn from mistakes you know. the only reason i gave it 1 star was because this site wont let me give nothing."
3,"Sr,Citizen","Enjoyed the READ BUT VERY ""WORDY""! I lived in HOLLYWOOD for 20yrs.(1958-78 and knew a lot of people in the ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY so there was much that was FAMILIAR. I did enjoy the HISTORY!"
1,Zzzzzzz,"This book embarassed me. How could I be interested in so unflattering a woman as Louella Parsons. And, actually, I found her life boring boring boring."
4,"Good toy, could have pegs","My 2yo son loves puzzles, and these were a great next step for him. The only thing I would do to improve them is to put pegs on each piece. When we first played with the puzzles, I was a little disappointed that the finger and toe pieces weren't cut a little straighter, but I don't think that minor detail affects the use of the puzzles. So, other than wishing there were pegs on each piece, I am overall very satisfied with these puzzles."
2,big shoes to fill,"Though this movie is still worth a look, by being an unofficial companion to ""paris is burning,"" there is a lot to live up to. That documentary has an almost effortless quality, getting to the reality and personalities of each of it's characters with an unparalleled ease. This successor at times seems forced, without a real logic behind why the subjects are special or why the ball scene still holds our attention. It's as if the director's vision was too broad. Maybe there was so much to tackle that a sole topic couldn't be picked. Still, its worth a look. You get to catch up with several familiar faces and see where these great underground artists have found themselves later."
4,Not complete,"Unfortunately my ""King me"" is not complete. There are missing 13 plastics stands to put the 13 candidates to the throne like is description in the contents."
4,Worked better than expected,"(...) I create short videos for myself and other members of my family. Weddings, birthday parties, vacations... Give me a tape and I'll edit it. I goofed around with VCD/SVCD at first and wasn't happy with the compatability issues and picture loss. I then started having to distribute my work on VHS which while 100% compatible wasn't optimal since I consider my work keepsakes and you know how VHS tapes tend to wear out. So I was a little hesitant when I burnt my first disk (Using Ulead Movie Factory). Would it play on my dvd players and those of my family? I can happily report that the answer is yes. The 1 hour DVD that I created has played on a 3 year old Panasonic A110, Panasonic A120, Samsung M310, Microsoft XBox and Sony Playstation2. I couldn't be happier with the results and with the cost of media coming down I can realistically send copies of my work on DVD to those that might have received VHS in the past."
3,Works well. Dvd-R is great,"The software didnt work, let me get this out first. I mean none of the software worked. I have downloaded a good bit of trial software and the burner works like a champ. The movies work in an XBOX, a 2 year old HP laptop,and a few others. Very happy with the hardware, not sure what was up with the software.I can say that the software it comes with for backup is good, as I download it from the main site. As far as the movie authoring software, I was not satisified with the download. I reccomend dvd software from Ulead, or Pinnacle."
3,Lacking innovation,"Al Dimeola is a great master of guitar. He knows how to make the guitar to cry, to chat, or to sing. Does he experiment? Yes, he does. But Flesh is probably not his best recording. It weaves anxious tunes you want to move through as soon as possible, it brings no innovation and leaves no memories. The tracks do not stick together well and the last track does not round the album on high note. Rather it hangs in vague and is cut undone."
3,"A step above ""First Offense"".","1985's ""Boy In The Box"" #20, is little harder edged over the first album. The first three songs are his best on this disc(MHO). ""Boy In The Box"", very electronic sounding got to #26, ""Never Surrender"" his biggest hit at #3,a very nice rocker-ballad and a tune I heard a bunch of on rock radio in '85 the classic russian tune ""Komrade Kiev"".After those 3 songs, the album to me falls apart, very dated now days."
3,Continuing the logical progression,"3 1/2 starsThis is like a more solid, more experienced version of what Rock Action sought to be..It is unfortunate that the success of a mogwai album is almost always deterred by it's insistence on breaking up the amazingly gorgeous or menacingly powerfull songs with ambient filler tracks, but it would be safe to say this album pulls it off classier then in the past. While still feeling like a bunch of tracks rather then a flowing album (Come on die Young is the only one that I feel attains the latter so far), Happy Songs for Happy People dazzles us with it's eclectic beauty, showcasing all of mogwai's sides we have come to love..A downside to this bands increased experience with recording studio albums does come with a bit of instrumental and compositional detatchment however, as the tracks do soar as brilliantly and boldly as ever, but with a more guided mechanic...A small complaint for one of rock's most introspective acts."
4,music for the night.,"i like to listen to this album at night when i am alone. it is a great album to just sit back and get lost in the moods of the music.... i often find my mind drifting between focusing on the music and my own thoughts. it isn't exactly ""happy music for happy people"" but it's not painfully depressing either.... it is music that might bring you down if you're happy, or bring you up if you're depressed.one great thing about mogwai is that when you are alone it really enhances the enviroment you are in. i guess you have to listen to experience it, but there is nothing like a long walk at night listening to an album like this.this isn't the kind of album i listen to everyday, but it is an album i will keep in my catalog for years to come.out of 10, i'd give this album about an 8.5, therefore i highly recommend it."
3,Creepy-beautiful instrumentals,Do you like Sigur Ros? Do you like Godspeed You Black Emperor? Do you like My Bloody Valentine's LOVELESS? Do you like the Cure's DISINTEGRATION?Then you'll love this.
3,"no, 3 is good","Well, I would really like to give it 3 1/2. This is the only Mogwai i have so i cannot compare it to any previous release. Overall, I enjoyed it on first listen. It is similar in a way to Sigur Ros but without the singing and a bit more mainstream. It's fairly diverse ranging from the intense and loud guitar in ""Ratts Of The Capital"" that borders on heavy metal to melancholy mood pieces with strings (cello) like ""Moses I Amnt"". They have a great full sound and i wonder if they could reproduce it live. I guess my only complaint would be that at times it get's monotonous. They just repeat the same line over and over and build up to a crescendo. But still I'll probably buy some more Mogwai based on this CD. and yes, it is kind of 'happy'."
2,"We Know We're Monotonous, But What Are You?","I'm not familiar with Mogwai's other albums, but when I stumbled upon the gorgeous -I Know You Are-, I was intrigued and wanted to know if the rest of the album was just as good. -Hunted By A Freak- was strangely pleasing and -Golden Porsche- was depressingly beautiful as well. The rest was so incredibly monotonous (-Boring Machines- being the worst) that they all feel like filler! -Stop Coming To My House- and -Ratts- start without any memorable melody, again, and both end in a cacaphony that has no resemblance to music whatsoever. Mogwai has to get way more creative on the next album to win me over."
2,Eh...,"It's not that it's bad...it just isn't very good. When I listen, I keep waiting for this catharsis that never seems to happen. They keep bumping against it, but they can't seem to break through. It's getting really difficult to tell their albums apart, and in my opinion they're one of the most over-rated bands out there. Even as a live act they fail to produce the type of energy that gets the blood boiling. I saw them with Bardo Pond, and Bardo completely upstaged them. I don't know...this is good background music, but that's the nicest thing I can come up with."
2,Do I not get it?,"This Mogwai -- all of whose albums I somehow ended up with -- are pretty boring. A weaker Sigur Ros, and nowhere near as strong as GYBE!. Maybe it's the constant guitar wash many people worship. The strings are welcome here for variety. You get the idea that any melody is from luck, otherwise it's just noodling. And emotion? Yeah, maybe the same one, really more a celebration of a muddy state of mind. If their thing is to build, then build! The thing I find most enjoyable about this band are the song names. However, they did make one work that does build well, and shines above the rest (besides a track or two here & there): the EP ""My Father My King."" That one's a keeper.NEW (May 2006): I do get it a bit more nowadays. A good listen overall.UPDATE (much needed): I get it, I get it now...! I play this a lot. Along with ROCK ACTION."
1,not quite what I expected,"I'm a mogwai fan and was waiting for this album to really floor me... this album only put me to sleep. Their style has gotten a bit schizophrenic recently, the problem is that they jump from one style and one mood to the other too quickly and in an un-natural way. The second track also mimics Labradford too much. A lot of these songs aren't that memorable either, most of the melodies just aren't that strong, un-comparable to some of their older gems (Summer, 2 Rights, Helicon 1 etc). The songs just drag without ever really grabbing the listener. I'd take the recent albums by Labradford, Sigur Ros and gybe! over this any day of the week..."
5,Rare and nice!,"Beethoven frequently lost his temper with composers and music editors who encouraged the arrangement of works for ""instruments which are opposing in every respect"".He deemed that only the composer of a sonata for piano may transcribe it for string quartet. This is the case of the sonata opus 14-1. The version for quartet is referenced Hess 34. The CD also includes the quartet opus 59-1.Here you have a chance to hear Beethoven transcribed by Beethoven!"
5,Great Price and Great Service,I appreciated that the book came ON TIME and was in great condition ..I am usually skeptical of buying books on internet but this turned out good for me! Thanks so much!
2,Consult the Style Manual Instead,"The book is okay and gives you some tips for composing a term paper; however, if you already have the proper style guide, there is no reason to buy this book.Now if it's available on reserve in your school library, it is not a waste of time to read. But, I would not buy it again."
1,KOCH VISION RUINS BLOOD DRIVE,"these poor filmmakers--they sent out their films to fangoria and koch vision really screwed them. the transfers are HORRIBLE. koch vision really screwed this one up. how could a distribution company botch up so many good films? Plus, they totally disregard the filmmakers by editing the films! What the hell is wrong with Koch?Do yourself a favor--don't buy this DVD. Contact Koch and tell them that the quality of their work sucks. Support your independent filmmaker. Stop shopping at Best Buy"
3,So-So Horror Anthology,"Blood Drive is a collection of short horror films made by regular people complied by Fangoria magazine. Supposedly only the best were used, but I find it hard to believe after viewing all of them. There are some very good films in the batch (""The Hitch"" comes to mind as does ""Inside"") and some not so good films (""Song of the Zombie"" stands out). For a so-so collection of horror shorts, this one is worth viewing."
5,Shadows of the Dead,Film-maker Joel Robertson's love of the zombie genre shines through in this frightening and haunting short film. A must-see for horror fans!
3,Confusing and strange.,"I am a huge Leslie Caine fan, but this book left me baffled. There was simply too much happening, without enough context. Too many suspects, too many arguments, too many leads. And none of the characters was developed enough to make me connect with them or the story.I also find the insertion of random chapters of interior design advice to be an annoying interruption. They do nothing to further the story or the character development. They belong in an end-of-chapter summation, or an appendix -- not thrown randomly into the book. And the way they're done in a different typeface and design - horrid! I actually thought there'd been a mistake. The font is difficult to read and the design is ugly.Overall, not one of her best books, or even her best series. I love the lightheartedness that went with some of her earlier series, which is entirely missing in this series. There's nothing light about it -- just depressing."
1,Yawn,"This book and writer couldn't be any more boring if they tried. Her style is dry and old and it seems like she only writes to formula. Ugh. There are much better writers out there, so I hope people won't waste their time with this or any of her other books, including the ones she's written under Leslie O'Kane. She should have changed her style not her name!"
1,"Looks great, but . . .","this scale is so sensitive to the tiniest irregularities in the surface you place it on and to any shift of your weight while standing on it, that it is useless. It fluctuated wildly depending on where I placed it, showing differences of up to 3 and 4 pounds within minutes, which is not helpful if you are using it to track weight loss. The design is sleek and beautiful, the backlit readout is clear and easy to read, but unless you are buying it as an objet d'art, forget it and buy a Tanita (as I did when I had returned this one)."
2,not reliable,Does not give readings accurately or display long enough to see.Very dissatisfied with this scale
1,Junk,"Worked well for about 8 months before it started acting wacky. The longer you stand on it, the heavier you get then suddenly the display goes black. You get a different weight every time you re-weigh. No good when you are working hard to lose weight. Warranty is worthless when you have to pay shipping to return it to Taylor. Wish I had read these reviews before I purchased it on impulse in the store."
1,Nice to look at - DOESN'T WORK,"When I ordered this I was informed that it would not arrive until February and was prepared for the wait. Within a few days the scales arrived with the message that they had ""found one"" to send.It must have been one that was returned as defective then sent out to the next unsuspecting customer (me).This scale has never worked since the second day it arrived!I threw away and recycled some parts of the packaging the day we opened it.Being older, I find it difficult to package and return items. I want my orders right the first time!Now, I have a defective item that was too difficult to package and return."
4,Sleek & Modern,"I love the modern and sleek look of the scale. I have found it to be accurate, much to my dismay. I don't think anyone would be disappointed with this product."
1,THE NICEST LOOKING PRODUCT I'VE EVER HAD THAT DIDN'T WORK,"Great looking scale but it didn't work. For some reason the readout changed from pounds to kilograms to stones between uses. Called the factory and they recommended a ""factory reset"" but that didn't work either. Returned it."
5,"Never received this item from Amazon, they ran out!","After waiting for numerous ship dates (all of which passed) for this item, Amazon told me that my order must be canceled because they could no longer supply this item to buyers. So I had to purchase this item from a company in Japan for a much higher price. It is a fine item though. It does contain the photo book that was included in the US version of this album, back in 1973, all reduced in size, and the gatefold artwork is from the UK version. The sound is wonderful also, but it is on TWO CDs, not one like the BMG version. I had to purchase this one since I already had LIVE DATES TWO,(finally available after all these years), both of them make a matched set."
5,DONT BE FOOLED!,"i rated this 5 stars 4 a reason. it is a half & half cd; half is realy early, classic style trance, other half of the tracks are disco. the trance on here is very good, but old, old, old. hey, for 99 cents, GRAB it!!!!!!"
4,"This was a gift for my Dad, I know he will love it.",The only bad thing about the CD is that it had a couple of cracks in the case when it arrived.
3,Leaves mouth wet for more,"I've had this CD for many years (was obtained as a McDonalds promo sometime in the 90's). There are only 10 tracks but they are some of Tina's best known. That said, there are alot of songs missing. Tina has had many songs in the last 40 years and I am now looking for a more comprehensive collection. This is an OK starter but you will want more after listening."
5,Great Family Friendly Meals!!!,My friend and I traded 12 different meals using this cook book and we LOVE IT! They have all been hits! She cooked double batches of 6 recipes and I did the same and then we swapped. I highly reccommend this book for families who want home cooked meals the whole family can enjoy!! We did this before my 3rd kiddo was born and the meals have been a lifesaver!
5,Wonderful,This book has helped in making my family meals a pleasure. It's time and money saving has been great. Thanks.
4,Great Guide!,"I really like this book. There are some great recipes, but there are also others that felt like a waste of time. My favorite part is that she outlines everything very well... it is easy to triple a recipe and she explains in detail how to make this once a month cooking easier. So far I'm pleased with this book and I'm on month number 2 and I have recipes that I will continue to make for the rest of my life."
4,Joyride,"This book is great for those who don't like their stories told quick and short. This book is about a 13 year old girls life on the road with her mother, whom she calls Joyce. Never staying in one part of the country more than a few months Nina is longing for the feeling of home and friendship. Although she has no problem gaining friends she often has to leave without saying good bye. When Nina is 14 Joyce promises that they will stay in Venice, California forever. This quickly changes when heart stopping events unfold.Try and unravel the mystery behind Joyce before Nina can. You should definately read this book. It's a great summer read and will keep you glued till the end."
3,"It would be five stars, but they changed the title!","After searching for the book ""Where it Stops, Nobody Knows"" by Amy Ehrlich, I was disappionted to find that it was out of print. I became very excited when I saw a new book by her...After getting the book home I read the jacket and realized that it's not a new book, why, it is ""Where it Stops, Nobody Knows"" I'm a little disappointed that there was nothing in the book that mentioned the previous title. It won the DCF book of the year in 1990 in Vermont. It is a great book and I recommend it to anyone who likes fast-paced books."
3,Sounds like very early W.A. Mozart,"The packaging and execution of the CD are fine; no complaints there.But the music itself is not at all in the same league as music of Leopold's mature son, Wolfgang Amadeus. This music is a bit simple and repetetive; like the music W.A. Mozart wrote when he was under 10 years old.It is interesting to have, and interesting to hear, but nothing here is a classical masterpiece either.If you want to hear music that is from a Mozart contemporary, try Muzio Clementi's piano works; they're much nicer. (although, as Wolfgang himself pointed out, the left hand doesn't have a lot to do. It never carries a melody, merely backs up the right hand)"
5,A must-need album for any serious heads,"When I first listened to this album I didn't really like it except for the singles, namely GOD Pt. III and Front Lines. Those songs are just great, with incredible beats, choruses, and lyrics. Then I listened to the album again and it grew on me. This album is just a great followup to their previous album, The Infamous. Hardcore gangsta rap fans have to own this album. Guest stars include Raekwon, Method Man, Nas, Big Noyd. To tell you the truth the guest stars don't really do their best performances but Mobb Deep makes up for it. Other great tracks include Drop A Gem on 'Em and Apostle's Warning. If you like this album also check out Big Noyd's EP, which is virtually a Mobb Deep album."
5,THE GREATEST CD OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"oh my god this hast to be the greatest album of all time forget life after death and illmatic hell on earth is the s@#$! The beats and lyrics are incredibly dark and grimy, the only song on here that wasn`t was can`t get enough of it. god pt 3 is one of the most incredible death balleds ever and whats wrong with apostles warning? Overall i think this is greatest album of all time and extremely underrated though. I can`t believe not too many people dont agree with me."
2,Very disappointing,"If you're thinking about getting a Mobb Deep album, I would highly recommend that you pick up 'The Infamous' instead of this one. There are a few nice cuts like 'God Pt3' and 'Drop a Gem on them', but other than that, it seems a little rushed. 'The Infamous' on the other hand, is one of my alltime favorite hiphop albums."
1,I would give this a 0 if I could,"This is a nothing book, I mean literally, this book contains NOTHING. No story. No plot. No ending. INCEST?.....there is none, there are not even any people in it."
3,"Great summer reading. Topical, well developped characters.","A very enjoyable read. Face Time is topical, in light of the Monica/Clinton story. It is also a very interesting exploration of modern relationships and the ways we justify prioritizing our work vs family."
5,Political Science,"Face Time, a sharp-eyed novel by former Bill Clinton speechwriter Erik Tarloff disproves George S. Kaufman's maxim that satire is something that closes in New Haven.Published (coincidentallly) around the time of the Monica Lewinsky revelations, it's fictional merits may have been lost in the general scandal, but withstand the test of time. A confrontation between the speechwriting protagonist who's being cuckolded and the feckless President, who quotes Winston Churchill's misbehavior (apparently he was mean to his servants) is classic, as the long-suffering scribe calls him on it....Are you comparing yourself to Winston Churchill?The book had a keen sense of human failure and rich novelistic detail, which leaves me puzzled about some of the negative responses to it on this site. I guess tastes differ. My hope is that it's re-release in this edition will gain it the wider attention i believe it richly deserves..."
2,OK,"hmmm....""Face Time"" follows the story of presidential speechwriter Ben Krause as his career ascends, unfortunately with help from his girlfriend--she has an affair with the president. In light of the Lewinsky scandal, I can see how a satire may be appropriate, but this was somewhat ""light"". The characters were quite implausible for the circumstances, especially Ben and Gretchen(the girlfriend/mistress). It seemed that Tarloff was struggling to reveal the plot, and what he did state was especially brief. This book came off as a ""summer reading"" type, though I found it difficult to sit on the beach with a dictionary in my shorts. The narrator's vocabulary was pathetically and unconvincingly immense...not to mention placed in long, unnecessary sentences. Of course this is my opinion, and if anyone wants to support some new, pretentious author go right ahead...but I want no more face time."
5,Power+Seduction+Ambition+Romance+Witty Repartee = FACE TIME!,"How curious......looking at a presidential affair through the lens of the guy who's being cuckolded by the President! What shines through isn't the tawdriness of the affair (a la Monica), but the zinging emotions that the characters experience, from the elated high of new love to the distressing darkness of things gone wrong. Mix in the spice of politics, and you've got FACE TIME.If you enjoy being totally absorbed by spirited fictional yarns, don't mind a story that hits close to home, at times, and are up for more than a few good laughs....then....you'll love reading FACE TIME. Get it!!!(Reportedly, this is Tarloff's first novel....I hope he'll keep them coming!!!)"
3,The flip side of presidential pecadillos...,"The characters are likeable, though they slip into the venal. No, you might not like the premise - infidelity spawned by power seduction (not rape!) - but Tarloff does a very good job of taking a 2 word cliche and developing it into an interesting story (the literary device is called a ""conceit"", I believe). He pens an all too plausible plot line and goes far enough to develop the characters well in this darker bedroom farce, and it has the ring of too much truth. It might cause you to think just one level beyond the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal as cartooned in the national press. It's a good enough read to keep you awake turning those pages and you probably won't disrespect yourself in the morning.Hey Erik & Laura - is this your story????"
1,Ugh,"Dreadful and depressing. I laughed out loud at some places where this foolish author tried to pretend he understood how men think and act. Worst line (in a fit of anger at his girlfriend): ""Don't think that just because I'm a liberal Democrat I'm not capable of domestic violence."" If that's your idea of good dialogue, you'll like this turkey; otherwise, give it a pass. (There's an obvious alternate title for this book. It is two words long and the first word is ""Sloppy""). ""Nuff said."
5,Massive 4x4 trancebeats and breaks,"I first heard Stargazer when it was out on vinyl, and instantly fell in love with it. It just feels incredibly tribalistic, until the part of the song which really feels like youre travelling through the stars. And then when you just don't think it can get any better, it takes off, and goes through the roof. The remixes are OK, but not as good as the original.Another tip for buying this CD is the ""Cosmic dancer"" track, It was a surprise to me since I had never heard it before, but this might be one of the best songs I've heard ever. Religous trance is the best I can describe it with, which lifts you off the ground and sends you flying..."
2,not really good,tmnt 2 battle nexus was a slow slugish poor excused for the game i have ever seen the only reason i dont give this game a one star is because of the unlockable acarde game dont buy this mess trust me
1,Trying To Save You Money,"The camera angles make this game very hard to like. The characters are redundant and make playing feel like a job. When you get to the boss, there is some rediculous way to kill them that sometimes takes a half hour to figure out. What a waste."
5,Must have for the Jag library,"While no single book has all there is to know about the E-Type. Each one makes its contribution.Paul Skilleter does a fine job of introducing you to the E-type, giving unique historical info (along with photographics of the monocoque's development.) He points out the salient differences in each series, and even tackles the job of providing information assiting the owner with maintaining an E-Type. Skilleter covers a lot of ground in this compact, very readable book.A far better distillation of E-type info than many of the coffee table books that attempt tackle the entire Jaguar line."
4,Excellent.Loaded with money saving information.,"I have owned and raised shetland sheepdogs for 20 years and thought I was well informed on dogs and their health care needs.After checking this video out from my public library, I am buying it today.It does indeed have many excellent tips for cutting your vet bill and is worth having."
1,This is not dependable.,"This product looses power constantly. The batteries don't make good contact, and anytime the camera gets a bump or a shake, it powers off. When it does that in the middle of a recording, you don't even get to keep what you've already recorded! It shows it as an 'Unknown File' and there's nothing you can do except delete it.I sent it in for repair and when I got it back, it still did the same thing. I don't know if they did anything to it or not, but I don't bother using it anymore as I've lost so much that I thought I had recorded.It would have been a great product if it weren't for that."
4,Great prompts.,"Although this book is intended for writers to gain story ideas, it is also full of great inspirational prompts for any journaler. I especially like the reminders to pay attention to your surroundings and write about them, whether you are in the supermarket or on a bus. Even my 10-year old was writing as a result of the ides in this book."
3,Good Story Starters,"This book is 160 pages, but there is only one prompt per page, so (minus the 8 pages of copyright info, etc.) that gives you 152 writing prompts. Not quite worth the $12.99 I paid for it when it came out, but certainly worth it if you can get it for the minimal price it's now listed at.There are some good prompts in here to get you thinking and get you started in your journals. If you need some extra ideas to keep you going then pick this book up."
4,A Big Part of My Life,"This was my first Wishbone Ash album and my favorite. So Many Things to Say... what a kickoff! If you have ever had woman troubles...The album is a little eclectic, but holds some real gems. Doctor, Ballad of the Beacon, No Easy Road, Sorrel and R&R; Widow are all keepers. I love the bass on many of these songs as I play bass. I think it is the guitar heroes who rate this lower. I love it,,,ROCK ON!!!I am waiting for a re-mix as the CD is mixed terrible - way too low."
2,A letdown,"This is an OK 70s album but it followed the magnificent Argus so it had a lot to live up to. Unfortunately the Ash didn't even try following it up. I like Sorrel, it has an Argus vibe about it, Beacon is nice and sounds good live, but the rest is just OK."
3,That difficult fourth album.......,"I have to agree with my compatriot from Basingstoke, that this must have been a hard album to make following what went before, and frankly, it was a bit of a disappointment. There are signs that they couldn't repeat the eclectic writing on Pilgrimage and Argus, but were looking for a more commercial, mainsteam sound. So, among Ballad of the Beacon and Sorrel we get Rock and Roll Widow (surely a refugee from one of a dozen inferior boogie bands) and No Easy Road (horns on a Wishbone Ash album? - Climax Blues Band maybe, but not the Ash). Everybody Needs a Helping Hand is rather lachrymose, saved by a decent solo, and Sing Out The Song limps along in an amiable, baggy-old-dog kind of way, but there really is only song that gets my ears pricking up and that's Ballad..... Still, I do listen to my old vinyl copy now and again ... in fact I only have vinyl Wishbone Ash, this was the last album of theirs I bought."
2,Disappointing,"Like many people, I was introduced to WA by the incredible ""Argus"" album, so I was eager to see how they would follow it up. Unfortunately, ""Wishbone 4"" only disappoints in comparison. In addition to the band's incredible musicianship, the strongest point of ""Argus"" was the songwriting; unfortunately, the material here just isn't up to par, in fact, most of the album is pretty pedestrian generic 70's guitar boogie. While ""Ballad of the Beacon"" and ""Everybody Needs a Friend"" are first-rate, most of the songs here are throw-aways: ""Doctor"" and ""No Easy Road"" sound like Humble Pie rejects, ""Sorrel"" tries to evoke an ""Argus""-style vibe in its imagery but fails due to an uninspired melody and indifferent performance, and ""So Many Things to Say"" (the worst offender) sounds like it was recorded on a cheap cassette deck in someone's garage. If you really love ""Argus"", this might still be worth a purchase for ""Ballad..."" and ""Everybody..."", but otherwise it's pretty slim pickings."
3,Hmmm...,"Something happened here, and we're not entirely sure what.This album should be good. We want it to be good. But it is only fair. Some will say that is because Andy Powell was overly controling. Maybe so. Don't know. Don't care.Okay, we all go through ups and downs, creatively. This is a bit more down than up in that sense. But the performances are still high quality level. But if the songs themselves suffer from 'too soon' completion, which is to say that it might have needed more work, then it doesn't matter how well you play them.Sometimes it just doesn't work."
2,Ash fan hates this CD...,"Gawd! This is a miserable CD. My album sounds so much better than this muted, muffled piece of junk. The songs are mediocre except for Sorrel, which is worth the price of the album.I saw them in concert when this album was released and they were incredible. This album has been in my collection since then and I know every note on it. This CD is an abomination. Get the LP. Record it into your computer, clean it up and burn it to a CD. Don't waste your money on this awful junk."
4,Pretty good book,"I read this book after reading Shaw's Wooden Spaceships series. Both are fairly good, and I have always wondered why more people don't know about Bob Shaw. Someone above said this book is worse then Ringworld which is totally false. Whatever you do don't read the sequal, Orbitsville Departure, as it was pretty awful."
4,Rural utopia,"Although the idea of a dyson sphere is not new, the author has managed to include in a reasonably interesting story. I do not like , however, that you read half the book before you get to the interesting parts. the ideal of the story, the utopian rural society, has proved to be disastrous when tried in cambodia, I dont think that this should the future of the human race."
5,Joi d'vivre,"I am new to Rickie Lee Jones, having heard of her through VH1's 100 Greatest Women in Rock and Chuck-E's in Love. This record is simply charming. Especially her cover of ""On The Street Where Yu Live"" the greatest song Woody Allen never used in his movies. Also a highlight is Showbiz Kids. Honestly people, who cares if she uses the f-word. Its not like she's deliberatly throwing it in there. Check this record out. I myself intend to further my exploration into Ms. Jones's work."
4,Peter's review from Holland,"After waiting a long time to catch some new work of Rickie, it was at first hand a little bit disappointing to learn that on the album were only covers. But listing to it, i absorbing the richness of the performance, i was glad that i have bought the album."
2,Preview First,"What's the point of covering a song unless you have a better idea... or at least a different idea. Being a long time RLJ fan, I bought this without previewing it, expecting interesting interpretations at least. My mistake. Here, RLJ offers no new insights or any real reason to re-do these numbers other than to make a buck. In the past, her voice was a vehicle for her inspired melodies and arrangements. This time her voice, which is a cross between Tom Waits and Shirley Temple with a cold, is front and center. After song 7, I couldn't take it anymore. I recommend previewing the album before purchasing."
3,another great one for RLJ,"You can't go wrong if you're a fan of Rickie Lee's. It's Like This is a ""small"" album with a collection of intimate covers recorded with a wink and a smile. Not unlike a set that might be included as part of Rickie's road shows over the past few years."
1,Maybe Next Time,"As a long time RLJ fan I always wait anxiously for a new release from one of America's truly original singers but I am very disappointed with this ill-conceived hodgepodge of songs. RLJ is clearly out of her element here. 'Show Biz Kids' is a tasty track and 'High Heeled Boys' is certainly listenable although clearly there was no need to re-record these as the originals are superior but the remaining selections are just out and out mistakes. 'Smile', as performed here is so trite and devoid of any feeling that you wonder why she even bothered to record this song: no pathos, no interesting arrangement. The remaining selections fare no better, they all have the feeling of cast offs from a private taping session. Indeed the entire album seems like a vanity pressing, and while it's always fascinating to hear an artist record cover versions, RLJ did this on 'Pop Pop', and to much better effect. It's always a treat to hear RLJ but I can only hope for a better album next time."
3,What would Momma Say?,"Boy, am I disappointed, what in the world possessed you to add obscene lyrics to this song (Show Biz Kids)? I was sharing it with my 13 year old son and was shocked and embarrassed that I even suggested that ""this is going to be a great Cd"". Obviously Rickie Lee Jones has not grown out of adolescence, this Compact Disc is in the trash.A one time fan!David"
3,Disappointed,"The cut, Show Biz Kids, by W. Becker & D.Fagen, uses the ""F"" word , loudly , frequently, and, clearly. While I'm no prude, the gratuitous use of foul language detracted from an otherwise interesting album."
1,I got this at a garage sale for $1 and got ripped off,"This was not worth the $1 I paid, this woman simply CAN NOT sing.Ricki: Hang it up, you are TERRIBLE.DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY"
5,The Case for Reincarnation,"A God for Lions is the strongest case for reincarnation yet. For unlike the others, this author has the proof. Gregoire confirms in a simple and understanding way that Einstein's findings concerning physical energy also apply to mental energy - that it is scientifically possible - actually probable - that upon death the mind does find another host. An essential read for those whose hope is re-embodiment."
3,Not Entirely Accurate,"This book is good for what it does. There are plenty of formulas related to Wicca and Hoodoo. I cannot vouch for the Wicca formulas in this book, but I can comment on the Hoodoo formulas. The formulas for Hoodoo are not accurate. For instance, one of the crossing powders ingredients is Myrrh. Myrrh has always been used as a purification/blessing ingredient. It smells nice, but it does not belong in crossing powder. A better bet would be Cat Yrondode's encyclopedic book on ingredients used in Hoodoo."
1,Not worth the money,"Okay I had heard the good and bad about this little book and decided to finally drop down the money so I could see for myself. Well after thumbing through it I now see why so many people truly dislike this book. While some of the recipes are correct the majority are not even close and several, namely the hoodoo recipes are so far from good or accurate that it will leave many scratching their heads. In my opinion save your money and time and do not waste your time on this book.Peace!"
4,Perfect under tree train.,"I bought this strictly for decoration under our tree, and was pleased. I did purchase additional track in order to run the track around the tree and through several tunnels we created with presents. The set was easy to assemble and has a realistic look. We ran it continously for a four day stretch without any problems. Grandkids and adults loved it."
4,Interesting and easy read on Harrah's and the industry!,"This book tells in an easy, readable fashion the story of Harrah's from the humble beginnings of a small parlor in Reno to the multibillion dollar behemoth it is today. Although the primary focus is on Harrah's, of course, the book covers the growth of the industry in the US overall from the early days, through the mob years in Vegas and the entertainment explosion that happened, to the proliferation of boats, reservation gambling and other gambling alternatives such as the lotteries through many US states.This is a great book to read for reminders on the basics of ""getting it right"" when it comes to customer service, treating employees right, thinking strategically and executing on a vision. It is amazing what Harrah's has done in the area of parlaying customer information into long term, profitable relationships!I have read many business books, this is my most favorite in recent months, for sure.Read on, and watch out for that river card :)"
5,great book on both marketing and the gaming industry,"If you're into biographies and really want to know what makes people tick, this is a great book. Shows the passion behind this company and will give you an ""insider"" look at the gaming industry that might not be obvious when you set food in one of Harrah's casinos.Not sure why the price is so high. I got this book a few years ago and it was the price of a standard book, about $15. Maybe an error?Regardless, I feel for more people, it will be worth the price. Great book!"
3,"""very FUNNY book""","This book is a riot! I could not put it down. One of the funniest books on gambling I have ever read.(and I've read 100 books on Vegas/Gambling.Go straight to page 43 first- ""there is no underworld presence today in Las Vegas""- this author really knows how to write satire.The book is just filled with one funny story after another about how everything now in gambling is on the up & up.Robert Shook is more humerous than that Connecticut Senator whose trying to protect children from the entertainment industry.Another fun thing to do with his book- circle the word ""lawyer"" and then underline all the Federal & State laws that his book exposes.God Bless America! We should all feel blessed to have a comedy writer like Robert.D.Matthew HaydenauthorVegas Stories"
3,Some of Elvis' Best--and Worst,"Blue Hawaii was not Elvis' best film, nor was it his worst (remember Harum Scarum?) The music from Blue Hawaii runs the gamut from brilliant (Can't Help Falling In Love) to bathetic (Ito Eats and the the self-parodic Slicin' Sand) and everything in between (Ku-u-i-opo or however you spell it). Ian Gillan of Deep Purple says that he and his friends were Elvis fanatics as kids--he could sing everything up through Blue Hawaii. In other words this album is like a ""cut-off"" point --afterwards, the movie soundtracks just got worse save for perhaps Viva Las Vegas."
5,Wow! Elvis!,"Hey, it's Elvis! What more can you say, after all he's the king.Good movie even though it's dated. PQ on a 100 inch screen is pretty good. Not HD quality but still decent."
5,Elvis and Hawaii--An Unbeatable Combination,"Tired of civilization? Want to escape to a beautiful island paradise? Then this CD is for you. The romantic ballads such asthe title song, ""Moonlight Swim,"" ""Hawaiian Sunset"" and ""Island of Love"" evoke images of beautiful sunsets and peaceful blue seas, and the more lively numbers, such as ""Almost Always True"" and ""Steppin' Out of Line"" are carefree and fun, which is another aspect of Hawaii.Hearing the great voice reminds us of why Elvis is still king, even after all these years. And the added songs at the end, which are repeats of earlier songs, with a few off the cuff remarks by Elvis, give us a peak into the spontaneity and ease with which he worked.This is music to listen to after a difficult day in the ""asphalt jungle,"" music which helps us relax and enjoy andforget the stresses and strains of modern society, at least for awhile!"
4,Blue Hawaii,I love the CD. It will help provide just the right atmosphere for the Hawaiian themed event I'm planning for my employer.
4,Great Music,"This is an excellent soundtrack that is classic 60's beach music.There are a few of Elvis' best songs on this album, but it isn't so great all the way through. I do reccomend you buy the regular version and not the limited, because the extra 7 songs are basically exactly the same as they were in the originally released tracks."
3,Blue Hawaii,Well the film was certainly better than Elvis' own knockoff version of it with Paradise Hawaiian Style and so is the soundtrack. Putting the film and the soundtrack in their proper perspective and comparing it with other beach movies of the same period it definitely stands out as the best. Unfortunatly as far as Elvis is concerned it is a shame that his talent was wasted on films such as this and the lightweight soundtracks that accompanied them.The highlight of this album is the ever memorable Can't Help Falling In Love which may be found on numerous compilations. I would only suggest the purchase of this album for an avid fan.
3,Worked for me..,"I'd been looking for a small(er) book on Slang and this book fit my purpose. It's not ""in depth"", that is, it doesn't hold much detail. But it does cover basics."
1,Ha!,"Very humorous. But it's only funny because it's so totally innacurate (I'm speaking, specifically, about the so called slang for San Francisco)... I don't know of any one who uses these terms, like 'The Mish' for The Mission. To do so while strolling Valencia would surely ID you as a tourist (or worse, an easy mark) in less time than it would take three Marines to dates on Capp Street."
4,"As pictured, includes clip","It's hard to come up with a witty review for a PVC filter, but it met my main criteria: it looks stock, it's black as pictured, and includes a new clip."
4,Under the surface...,"Life on the moon is boring. People live in a constant, artificial environment called the Bubble, where nothing can afford to be wasted. Marty was born on the moon, and he had never been to Earth. He makes friends with a misfit called Steve. They steal a crawler and go joyriding outside the Bubble.When the crawler crashes through the moon's surface they find a very strange world indeed...This is an interesting book about life in the future, but it wasn't as action packed as the Tripods Trilogy. Maybe because there aren't as many characters, or there isn't as much variety with location.The book was published the same year Neil Armstrong became the first person to set foot on the moon. The Lotus Caves is set nearly 100 years after that event.It's an interesting idea that verdant beauty could exist beneath something so arid and featureless. But recently scientists discovered water beneath the moon's surface, so maybe John Christopher wasn't so wide of the mark with this story."
4,The beginning of great Science Fiction,"I remember checking this book out from the public library oh so long ago when I was a child. I loved this book and all of John Christopher's books when I first read them as a pre-teen and re-read them again and again as I was growing up. John Christopher's books are what made me a Science Fiction fan. I love stories of people living on other worlds or on this one altered a bit by some circumstance or another. This book and all of John Christopher's will make you look at the world and question the norm. Is freedom really freedom or is just a nice captivity?I'm trying to gather all of his books so that my children can read them now...not so easy a task. If only I'd known then how difficult it would be to put all these pieces of literature together some day. After reading them so many times you feel that they will always be at your fingertips when you want to read them again. But sadly, some of them are rare and impossible to find."
4,"not as good as the ""White Mountains""","I sought this out because of the great admiration I have for Christopher's Tripod Trilogy. In fact, I'll pick up a book of his whenever I come across one.Unlike ""No Blade of Grass"" (written for adults), ""The Lotus Caves"" is pitched to the same age range as the Tripod Trilogy.It also features the disciplined style you saw there, but the story is not nearly as good. This is likely because ""The White Mountains"" hooks you early with the bizarre mystery of the capping and the Tripods, whereas in this one, the mystery takes a lot longer to get off the ground (i.e., p. 74-5).Then there is the fact that the story doesn't really lend itself richly to allegorical interpretations, as the Tripods trilogy did, or at least ""The White Mountains"" did. Unless the moonbase is a metaphor for conventional society and the Plant a metaphor for what it's like to free yourself with drugs? I don't know. It was written in 1969."
4,Clannad disbanded,"At least according to an article on Wikipedia, Clannad disbanded in about 1997. However, they reunited at the Celtic Connections Festival in Glasgow in February 2007. They expressed a desire to produce a new studio album, but nothing more has come so far. They also began touring again in March 2008. If this article is true, then let's hope they crank out another CD sometime soon. This would certainly explain the large number of compilations."
1,sorta like a day old can of soda pop,"Maybe at one time this group was cutting edge in New Age, however I found this cd a dissapointing collection of music. This cd DOES NOT has a timeless quality like Enya's or Loreena's many albums..I am glad it was not my first Celtic cd."
3,The best?,"Let me begin by saying that there are some great tunes here: ""Seachran Charn Tsiail,"" ""In Search of a Heart,"" ""Buachaill on Eirne"" and ""In a Lifetime"" (featuring U2's Bono) among them. In fact, a great deal of their stellar earlier work is represented here...and that's the problem. ONLY their earlier work is represented here. Later music, such as the beautiful ""I Will Find You"" and ""Na Laethe Bhi"" are nowhere to be found.It's a good collection...but the best? I think not."
4,"Good, diverse mix of their early works","I'm a huge fan of SOME of Clannad's work, mostly the traditional, celtic-inspired numbers, not the Irish-pop as much. This collection is a good sampling of their first wave of releases. Again, I would favor the traditional fare over the contemporary songs, but I like music that is done well, no matter what its genre. This should give you some idea of which of their earliest works to buy. Happy listening!"
5,great music,"I just went to their concert and I couldn't believe how good they were. I had never heard of them before so I didn't know what I was expecting. Their CD was even better than the concert and I enjoy every track, even the hidden one. This is a great CD and I encourage you to buy it. If you like Oasis, then you'll like this CD and will love Spacehog."
4,And It Is,"Spacehog's newest album was in my hands the day it was released. I think I might have been one of the few people in the country who actually searched for a release date and grabbed it as soon as it came out... and I wasn't disappointed. Spacehog proves to me that rock music is not dead or stupid. With all the crap out there, the Hogs turn in a solid performance, contributing great songs to the genre. While recently several bands have given in to releasing CDs of ballads (note newest Bon Jovi album), Spacehog rocks unashamedly. Jupiter's Moon may not blow the roof off, but it has it's own jam. After that, it takes four more songs before the album even tries to slow down again. The momentum keeps up throughout. I'm impressed. If you want a reason to buy this album, listen to ""And It Is."" Between the riff and the classic backing vocals, this song is what rock was and forever should be..."
2,They went down in flames after Resident Alien,"SpaceHog are inventive,yes,but just plain boring.The arrangements are somewhat creative and the guitars and drums featured on this cd are sometimes ear-popping.It's just that the songs are often a bit over-the-top or unnecessary.A few catchy songs though should make this cd have one,possibly two mtv/radio tunes.Somewhat a disappointment since I loved Resident Alien."
2,Spacehog Doesn't Have their Old Charm,"I fell in love with Spacehog's Resident Alien. It is an absolutely awsome album and I became an instant fan. I must admit I was disappointed with the Chinese album, and was unsure if I should purchase this one. I'm glad I recieved it as a gift and didn't spend my own money. Not that it... majorly...I mean I'd rather listen to this than oh say, Kid Rock or Backstreet Boys. But it just doesn't have the same quality as Resident Alien. I wouldn't really recommend this album if your looking for something like Resident Alien. This isn't it."
1,Out of ideas and tired.,"What a HUGE disappointment. After a first album that belongs on ""All time great albums"" lists, and a folow-up that showed that they weren't a fluke, this things outright ""is bad."" Maybe worth more than one star from a mediocre band, but Spacehog is not mediocre. They should give fans better than this. Maybe stardom and Liv Tyler has clouded main songwriter Royston Langdon's creativity (and who can blame him) but if so they should've just taken a break. The only really good, fun song on here is ""At Least I Got Laid"", and as stated by others, it makes no sense with the rest of the CD. At least it had one good song."
5,So Far I Love Cingular,"First of all, this $59 family plan is not readily available in non-corporate Cingular stores, at least in Queens, NY, so I am happy to see it offered here. So far my experience with Cingular has been truly outstanding - Great Reception in my apartment (5 bars all the time - with previous carrier I was lucky to have 2). Super fantastic customer service on the phone and in the corporate store (which is interesting because I have read accounts from Cingular users in the past indicating they were very unhappy with same - so I commend Cingular for making obvious improvements)"
5,Intense Western Romance Adventure,"This was a well written intense story that you could feel every emotion in the relationship between Tempest and Buck with their growing relationship that was so much like real life with their feelings of lust, trust, fear and trying to hide their love from themselves and each other.Buck, all male in every way.Tempest a strong willed woman full of love and need for Buck who made her feel alive. Jonas who you hated for being a cruel pathetic type of man that loves to beat up on woman and is a disgrace to his heritage.The story was so real with good and bad emotions that you would feel in real life back then. The adventure in the last half of the book was so intense that I thought I was watching a movie instead of reading words. I highly recommend this western romance with growing intensity and adventure.Great writing and Great read."
5,First book read,"This the very first book I have read by Charlene Radeon, It will be the first of many more to come! Just wonderful!!!"
4,"Old Model, New Time","I have had this model long ago, but it has been lost.Good to have it back.Will go with the rest of fire apparatus models I now have."
5,Thank God for Bobgans,"If you want a peek at how most of our churches got infected with worship of self over worship of Christ, read this well-written and balanced expose' of Dobson. Years ago I read Dobson's response to a book review of the first edition of this book, published in Christian News, Fenton, MO. Dobson's irrational almost juvenile attempt at rebutting the Bobgan's, provided even greater confidence in the book, Bobgan's fidelity to God's Word and in their analysis of Dobson. He had no leg to stand on.Faithful Christians...you need to own this book."
4,GREAT! Bring on season 6!!!!!!!!!,Cannot wait til season 6 comes out. Cannot wait to own the entire series.As soon as season 6 comes out i will immediately be ordering.Such a good show.
5,This is really a wake up call for all companies,"Finally, what I have been telling many of my clients, has been written about in a very readible form. IMPENDING CRISIS tells it like it is...with no posturing or fluff. It is really a wake-up call for anyone who has responsibility for ensuring a company has the workforce needed to compete in today's world...and who doesn't have that responsibility. This book is not just for HR executives...it is really for CEO's CFO's and General Managers who want to be ahead of the curve when the labor shortage hits.I have given this book to several of my clients who need an objective, realistic view of the upcoming labor market and what to do to keep people."
5,Impending Crisis is for real,"Never before have Director Boards and Executives been so focused on the ""Near-at-Hand"" as they are today. With the economic crises,Corporate governance issues and current talent availbilities, long term stategies today mean ""what are we going to report to the financial community next quarter!! Impending Crises puts the focus where it needs to be-----and forcefully. Human Resource Vice Presidents (who truly are strategic business partners) and Human Resource consultants are thrilled to finally have a meaningful resource to be able to refer to in trying to get the message across to the corporate world that this shortage of future talent is for real and needs some SERIOUS attention. This is a very meaningful guide to be shared by all executives."
4,This disk should come with a washcloth,"Wow. Absolutely Amazing. This is where the goods are right here boy. This is dirty, ""Mud Music"". Like a freight train in a short skirt drivin through a sludge pond. Complete with grinding rhythms, wierd shrieks, and all the phlegmy gutteral moans you can chew, that'll have you checking the liner notes to see if what you heard was actually a word or not. It's a yummy mudpie."
3,"Gritty and good,..but very different","im a huge ZZ Top fan.. and when i first bought this cd/album i was hopeing for some, just unforgetable down-right, mean, biker Riff's that stick in your head and never leave...however this album of theirs didnt do that for me exactly,..i was slightly disapointed in that area, i felt like most of the songs started to sound the same after awhile,..but at the same time i couldnt stop listening, evey song has a very Gritty, almost sloppy bluesy style that i love,..the words can be a bit 'funky' or 'corny' but thats zz Top for ya, and i love it either way,..and even though the riffs seemed simialr to one another,..the guitar work and drums durring the rhythm sections are so awesome! that it'll make you wish the song could play forever,..so all in all id have to say this is their roughest and Rawest-in-style album out there, very different but very zz Top at the same time..and if your into that, this cd is for you"
5,One of zz tops finest records!,Great record up there to me with the best of them!so is there latest la futura with the 2 bonus tracks!
2,Stuck In A Bass Tone,"This recording seems to be stuck in a eerie tone with an over use of bass notes. Some of the tracks most especially What's Up With That and Pretty head work very well. This is mostly do to the special emphasis Billy Gibbons contributes on vocal and guitar on these tracks in particular. Vincent Price Blues has some interesting moments as well. Most of the other stuff is just stuck in neutral. There are some good riffs but the soloing is kind of muted. Also, what is really needed is a high energy Dusty Hill vocal. A track like Tush and Francine would really liven up this batch. As it is, this collection is sort of middle of the road fare at 2 1/2 stars."
4,Mean Rythm Indeed.,"This is a classic example of what the good reverend B. Gibbons and his cohorts can dish out when their on the money.With his sharpened Peso pick attacking his guitar strings emitting those signature whistling lead solo's coming at you through several Expandora distortion pedals you know he means business.His voice is as raw as the Grand Canyon,the songs are tight as a closed fist and the drums and bass are funky and primal, what a great combo.Yes indeedy folks it's all there in one neat package, so what are you waiting forhave a sip of Rythmeen you'll feel better for it.Oooohh Yeah!!"
5,Low down and dirty,"This is one of ZZ Top's best albums. The fact that it is from the 90s defies comprehension. It is loud, distorted, and bluuuesey. Great stuff. You need a rack o'ribs and some cold beer and a CD player and you'll get the point. Nothing like the 80s."
2,not so shimmering as said,not so shimmering as said tobe .there're products much more perfector than this one.Sorry but ther's no shimmer and it's worst when mixed with an other foundation.
4,Not earthshaking but worth listening to,"This is a CD bought when studying in a class about music appreciation/czech nationalism.With that in mind, it is a good example of the piano music created at that time and in that part of the world.May I add, that unlike Harold C. Schoenberg's opinion, ('The Lives of the Great Composers') I don't believe this piano music is a 'watery distillation' of Franz Liszt (p. 379), although it is of course influenced by him. Who else was going to influence it?"
2,Skip this one unless you are a completist,"This album doesn't have many of the characteristics which made Hawkwind great on their later albums. They were really just getting started on this album. They hadn't developed into a ""space rock"" band yet, they were just a mediocre psychedelic-rock band. ""Hurry On Sundown"" is a catchy folk-rock tune, but it doesn't really sound like Hawkwind. Bottom line: I bought this album because I wanted to have every Hawkwind album, but I NEVER listen to it."
5,Great!!,"What a smart, eloquent, from-the-heart book. Unfortunately any gay author with the slightest bit of humor is usually compared to Armistead Maupin, but Bayard is the first I've read who comes close while bringing his own particular brand of wit to the table."
4,Hilarious and wonderful book!,"For some reason I purchased this book some time ago, put it aside, and just found it again last week. I thought it was a wonderful book. I started to laugh when Patrick and Alex split up at the beginning of the book. They do not seem to have much of a relationship; nor are they very upset. Alex is a neat-freak; he wants to know if he can clean Patrick's mini-blinds before he leaves because it will make him feel better. I laughed all the way through it, and read it in about two days. The characters are all crazy, the dialogue is fast and funny, and eventually, the author draws a real lesson that we can all take to heart. While it is funny, there is a real lesson to this book. Run to your nearest bookstore!"
3,Amusing but slight,"I have to admit this was a sweet and amusing novel about the quest for love. Half-way through I hoped it would end the way it did. I also made a pact with myself that if I managed to make it 2/3 of the way through, I'd have to finish the book. Nearly 500 pages seems waaay too long to devote to this slight story and these (mostly) uncomplicated characters."
1,I wouldn't bother!,"Don't bother with this one! it isn't worth the time. In fact, I couldn't finish it and I lost interest in it after the first quarter. Bayard tries his hand at a Noel Cowardesque type of comedy of manners but unfortunately it comes off as a little ""half baked"" and ultimately contrived. There is a severe lack of dramatic tension and dreadfully droll and half hearted attempts at comedy. What exactly does Bayard want to do with this? So Patrick falls asleep and sees a man of his dreams - who cares! There is nothing about this story that is original or dynamic, rather, you are just faced with pages of inane, inept dialogue with little or no impact. There is an attempt at some nice, easy and relaxed conversational style but the negatives of Bayard's writing by far outweigh the positive. Forget it!"
1,Disappointing...,"I was very disappointed with this book. The story has potential but becomes totally stupid. The main charcter, Patrick, made me angry because of his endless stupidity. Gay people are not this totally brain dead. I read the review by Publishers Weekly and was amazed that they compare Bayard to Armistedad Maupin's writing! NO WAY. Maupin is a master story teller and his writing is on no level of this book! I read three fourths of the book and finally gave up on the ridiculous search for ""SCOTTIE"". Save your money and time."
2,a freshman effort that cries for narrative technique,"The other reviews must have been written by the author's friends. While I liked the idea of the book and what he was trying to achieve, I finally gave up mid way through. This book seems to be a real freshman effort. It's ferociously extended with dialogue and virtually no narrative. Most of the dialogue is pedestrian. It should have been a gem and brought in under 200 pgs. I don't know what purpose the father and Marianne serve. I don't think they edit books at Alyson. It was a delight to read about characters searching for love with all their quirks, but learn some technique."
3,book,"I bought this book for a young man who had lost his grandmother. i did not read it my self, it was a gift."
2,More frustrated with this book,"I am half way through this book, and it's starting to drive me crazy. The authors love to use bullet points. But often they use them to mention one word that really should come with some explanation. As it is this book often reads like an outline for a lecture that is designed for the speaker to expand on the bullet points.This book does have useful information, but the widespread use of bullet points means the book has less information than you would expect from 400 pages."
1,This book doesnt teach you how to plot PCB...,"I would say, these 400 pages only give you an introduction to what PCB is. If you want to learn how to plot PCB , or good practise in plotting PCB, this is definite not the book.I have read half of this 400+ pages book, but failed to find anything useful. Full of repeated but brief points, there is no elaboration on it."
2,This CD is just OK!,"While the playing of the soloists is fine, the group as a whole take such slow tempos for each work. The Bruckner chorales work well for trombones, but the tempos are so slow that musical direction is lost. Very careful playing in the Bozza allow for precise execution of the work, but the unusually slow tempos make this performance lackluster & unexciting."
5,Giorgia sings a Gino Vannelli cover........,"To be honest we bought this 2 cd box because there is a GINO VANNELLI cover : SOMETHING TELLS ME on cd number 2, track number 9 !!! But we are happy we bought this amazing voice!!!And when we hear the sounds of : SOMETHING TELLS ME....... A realGINO VANNELLI quality song we are impressed by the emotional wayGiorgia sings this GINO VANNELLI cover !!! 2 nice cd's to have in your music collection, worth while to order........But remember only 1 person can really sing this Gino Vannelli song and that is GINO VANNELLI Himself !!!! You can hear Gino Vannelli sing this SOMETHING TELLS ME on His album : BIG DREAMERS NEVER SLEEP released in 1987."
1,rather misleading,"It is impossible to tell from the Amazon description that this ""12 Piece"" set includes only 4 tips and 8 plastic bags. The tips are fine quality, but I must say I am very disappointed. Amazon should include this in the description and Wilton, frankly, should be ashamed of itself for marketing this as such."
4,Cupcake Decorating Set,"Great set to decorate your cupcakes! It's a gift, so we'll see how she likes it! Great packaging and fast shipping!"
4,Easy to use,I bought this and have never used decorating tips before. The instructions were easy to follow and my cupcakes turned out great!
5,Great value,I got these for multiple uses. They worked great for using melts to decorate cake pops and other treats. Very easy to use and clean.
4,Good for beginners,I'm new to cupcake business so I was excited to receive my set. I was a bit disappointed with the size of bags (very small) but I managed to decorate my cupcakes and they looked amazing. I would recommendthis little set to all beginners.
4,Great for beginners,I had fun with this set and ready to buy more tips. I found this set at target for under $4 which was perfect!
2,"it will suffice, but...","""12 piece"" refers to four tips and eight bags. I am giving this low rating because the bags are so small, it's difficult to get frosting in them. I'd spend my money on a better set."
4,Great kit,"This kit is great for beginners! Word of advice...visit the wilton website...it gives you step by step instructions on how to use all their products (including the tips in this kit!) as well as giving GREAT recipes and ideas. Love wilton products, and love that they have such an awesome website!"
3,Got what I was looking for...,"I bought this kit specifically for the 1M tip and the bags, and that is pretty much the only parts of this kit I have utilized. I might be able to make better use of the other tips at some point, but the 1M tip is currently my favorite. I would have liked if this kit if it gave some more instruction on the other tips, so maybe if I looked that up myself I would get some more use out of the rest of this kit. But the 1M tip -- awesome!"
4,Cake decorating away,There were no screw caps in the box........good thing I already have severalotherwise the decorating tip does not stay on the end of the bag well...
4,To cute,I got this for my kids. I wanted something for them to do besides playing video games. I was running out of ideas. this tapped into their imaginations and wow. We had so much fun.
1,Garbage,"The tips didn't come with anything to attach them to the bag and the tips are too large, the frosting just falls right through. Garbage..."
4,"Despite Some Historical Inaccuracies, this Book Shines!","Having read several of the more scholarly treatises on Abbess Hildegard of Bingen, I'm finding it a breath of fresh air to experience her as a living being. The book is beautifully written and is not afraid to present Hildegard as all too human, dealing with the concerns and fears that must have accompanied her extraordinary visionary gifts. Although Hildegard would never have called herself a ""feminist"", since she embraced the precepts and beliefs of Catholicism, including the superiority of an all-powerful male God, she held women in high regard and challenged many of the assumptions of that time about women the value of women in the eyes of God. It is difficult to imagine that the Catholic church never officially granted sainthood to Hildegard; however, she is considered a saint in Germany - and I agree!"
4,Hildegard comes alive.,"The life, the country, the contemporaries, and the political times of Hildegard come alive in this book. She was more than a religious woman who could write music - she had a great deal of courage and determination which even today would make her an outstanding feminist. Read it while listening to her music and find your dreams taking yyou to another world."
1,Highlander: Shadow of Obsession,"This book might have sucked less royal if it had been less about Neason's original character, and more about Darius. Even then, it might still have sucked somethin' fierce, as Neason's not a very good writer, and the book is far too short."
2,Just ok,It is a little too brown for black eyebrows and looks funny in daylight. I wont buy again. Try again too faced.
4,Excellent book for IZ-001,"This seems to be the best book out there for IZ0-001.For the most part this book is great,however certain topics like LOCKS, PRIVILIGES and VIEWS are covered at a very high level of abstraction.I would recommend oracle manual for these topics.Aditionally the book does cover pair-wise comparison but does not explicitly use this term.Please be sure to familiarize urself with pair-wise comparison.From what i have been told IZ0-001 almost always has a question on pair-wise comparison and i sure did have one."
3,OCP SQL/PLSQL Paper,Cleared my OCP Paper of SQL/PLSQL today by getting 55 out of 57. Syllabus covered in this book is more than what is required. I feel that Instructor led course for SQL/PLSQL is just sufficient. But I would recommend the tests given at end of each chapter. They broaden the concepts. Plus there are some minor errors which one has to take care.
4,did the job,"I used this book exclusively to pass the exam (40/57). Ok, it was a minimal passing grade, but I have no Oracle experience. I found the book's practice exams to be very similar to the actual test...The text was clear and the problems had only a few errors that I noticed."
3,great for getting through the exam but not for the beginners,"This book is great to get through the book,but not up to the mark.It doesn't take you to the details which is required for the exam.Better to find some other books along with this.I, passed the exam using only this book (40/57),but it didn't fetch the mark I desired.I am new to oracle,so it was tough for me to get through this exam by concentrating only on this book and in a time of 15 days,not for the beginners!IF U ARE A BEGINNER try to find some other books along with this.Best Of Luck!"
3,A good book- sort of.,"I have a small amount of experience writing PL/SQL. When I used this book to study, I found many good points within. However, I found a few areas difficult to understand and other areas discussed, but not explained. One other problem I found with the book is that certain areas on the exam were not even mentioned in this book. I used an old DBA 8 (Oracle Press) guide, and that helped. I also signed up for the SelfTest practice exam, which was a lifesaver.I am sure that I would have passed the exam (well, probably) by using only this book as a study guide, but I surely wouldn't have passed with such a comfortable margin.In my case, there were several areas that were covered in great depth in this book -- subjects that were not included in the exam at all.I will not buy a book from this series again (for the other 4 tests).BTW: I got 50/57, so I passed with an 87.77 percent score. I am sure that this book helped with that."
2,Waste of Money,This book is waste of money as far as preparation for certification is concerned. Oracle Press book is the best. I just wasted $ 39 on this book.
4,Easy to Understand,"I am studying for my exam and have read the Instructor Lead Training (ILT) book that I borrowed from a friend. When I do not understand something, I go to this book for an easy to understand explanation.Each of the ten chapters have about 20 review questions and there are two practice exams on the CD. There are some things that was not covered in the ILT book are covered in this book.Contrary to the previous commentor, this book is a very good study guide."
1,Not all books are relevant forever!!,"I returned this very outdated and sincerely, not up to calling it self ""Updated and Expanded Edition"" of a book. If you are looking for a HOW TO book for back when your parents where still young and the microwave oven was a fantasy to many, then this might be the history lesson you are looking for. But for anyone who is interested in learning how to shoot buildings with today's (2007) equipment, well you may want to look elsewhere."
4,Very Good Book,"Gerry Kopelow, in this book, gives lots of helpful hints about the way to shoot astonishing photos of Building and interiors, keeping in mind the main ""client"" of this kind of photos: Architects, Designers and so on. The most useful hints in this book are the ones about the way you can save money, correctly choosing lights, materials, compositions ... a very good book, both for the beginner and the pro."
5,Contents:,"Written for the common man to understand. Cover the solar system, apparent daily revolution of the stars, relation of time and longitute, the annual motion of the earth and its results. Also covers the telescope and how to work one. Part 3 is about the sun, earth, moon, eclipses of the moon and sun. Part 4 is on the planets and their satellites. Part five covers comets and meteors and part 6 covers the stars. Written originally in 1902."
1,STAY AWAY!,"AS A GO VIDEO LOYAL VCR FAN I MUST SAY, STAY AWAY FROM THIS MACHINE. THE VHS TRACKING DOES NOT WORK. THE MACHINE PLAYS ONLY PRE-RECORDED TAPES & SOMETIMES RECORDS PROGRAMS @ FAST FORWARD SPEED! DON'T BOTHER WITH EXTENDED WARRENTY OR EVEN TRYING TO GET THIS MACHINE FIXED! I CALLED SERVICE & WHAT A ROUND & ROUND LOAD OF BULL I GOT. THE DVD DOES PLAY FINE. I AM NOW ON A QUEST TO GET MY 400+ MOVIES TO DVD BEFORE MY DUAL GO VIDEO VCR DIES."
2,More Info.,"I rate it a 2 because it didn't give that much information. Some people just don't have enough money to go out and buy books. Especially young adults on a fixed income. When I come to the internet I expect to learn and read, not spend my money. Thank You"
4,Ben van Oosten's Interpretation,"The only reason I don't give this recording five stars is because I feel that van Oosten's performance of the opening Allegro vivace of Symphony #5 drags a bit, and the recording itself is somewhat dark and muddy in tone, more than I like to hear in a pipe organ recording. It needs more brilliance, which may be due to van Oosten's choice of stops. Other than those two caveats, it's a fine recording and well worth the money. Anyone who loves pipe organ music will enjoy this."
3,Great Music on a landmark Organ.,"This is a nice recording of great music on the 1890 Cavaille-Coll Organ at the Abbey Church of St. Ouen in Rouen France. This pipe organ is one of the most magnificent sounding organs ever built, but this recoding fails to capture the true sonic splendor of this instrument, with its powerful 32' Bombarde Reed."
3,Hawkwind - 'Ritual Of The Solstice' (Emergency Broadcast System) 3 1/2 stars,"I've never been all THAT much into band's remixed releases as such, but I thought this ten track remix CD of Hawkwind classics (mostly from the '70's) was pretty decent. I liked the two songs that Astralasia did a fine job on ""Spirit Of The Age"" and ""Uncle Sams On Mars"" as well as what the Knights Of The Occasional Table did with Michael Moorecock's doomsday recital ""Sonic Attack"". Actually sort of dug the remix here by the British dub reggae outfit - Zion Train's effort with ""Damnation Alley"". Keep in mind this import CD might be hard to find."
5,Great way to pay off your mortgage and save thousands!,I found the strategies unbelieveable...too good to be true before I tried them myself. And they work! I will be paying off my house years and years before my 15 year mortgage would have been paid and saving ten of thousands of dollars! It's well worth the cost and will pay itself off instantly if just one strategy is used!
5,An excellent book! A must if you want to buy a house or car!,"There are so many strategies for saving money, and reducing debt, i.e.: Credit cards, automobile loans, and mortgages. Shows how to buy any car you want with cash after initally barely being able to afford a car at all. I read the book cover to cover, and sold it for more than I originally paid for it - probably better than you can say for any other strategy or gimmick *you've* ever tried!"
3,it's okay..,"It's a nice book with vivid stories that illustrate the author's point. But, he didn't have to write so much about so little. His main point was simply ""trust God""- an article would suffice. He didn't talk about the greater principles involved in failure as described in the Bible. Besides this criticism, this book is a nice place to start."
2,Not much of a story,"I got hooked on Barbara Delinsky books after reading ""Coast Road"" and ""Three Wishes"". I loved both of them. So I decided to go back and read some of her older ones. This one was very weak. She seemed more interested in telling the story of a runner rather than the relationship between two characters. I suggest passing on this one and reading one of the other two I mentioned which were excellent."
1,waste of time....,"I'm very disappointed. After enjoying Delinsky's books so far, this one was a complete bore. No plot, no climax. I skipped paragraphs. I finished reading just for the sake of finishing. I regret not reading the reviews here before getting this book."
2,A non-breathtaking story read by a great actress.,"This is a review of BOOK ON CASSETTE. The story itself is nothing special. It isn't clear why Dana is so afraid to let her new lover in on her terrible secret --...she has asthma. Everything else comes down to a ""nice"" story, perhaps worth listening to on your way to work in the morning. The acting of the performer, J. Smith-Cameron is what livens up this story. She reads sensuously, beautifully, perfectly matching the voices of each of the characters, making a clear distinction between them. It's a pleasure to listen to."
1,Not up to snuff,this is a very poor example of her work. It reads like it was turned out very hurriedly and has absolutely no plot except for a whiney heroine? who is a mama's baby. In this day and age asthma is NOT the death sentence she seems to want it to be. I got out of it that she thoroughly enjoyed having a disease that everyone would feel sorry for her about. Very disappointed in this.
3,Gunsmoke episode featuring Kitty Russell,"""The Gold Mine"" -- After being given a gold mine by an old friend, Kitty Russell travels alone to the rough-and-tumble town of Pickax. When Matt Dillon learns where Kitty has gone, he sends Thad Greenwood to look after her. But Thad is shot and soon Marshall Dillon is off to Pickax. First aired on December 25, 1965. (Black & White) (In a bit of confusion, Amazon.com lists this as both a color and B&W episode -- although this is probably Gunsmoke's final season in black and white.) Approximate run time is 52 minutes."
3,memories of martha's vineyard,"How can anyone make a video about Martha's Vineyard and not even mentionthe original inhabitants who still live there-- the Wampanoags of Gay Head?The video talks about the ""diversity"" of Gay Head then totally ignores thenative people as if they don't exist. How narrow-minded is that?"
2,Misrepresented in description,"I just opened this thing and I'm angry: sure it's 250 TC cotton on one side, but the reverse side isn't even fabric. The back side is composed of some kind of synthetic fibers pressed together, it's not even woven. It doesn't look like it would survive a single washing, and my reason for buying 250 TC to begin with was to be able to wash it frequently.It has about 3/8 inch loft."
1,Play the first one again!,"Yeah, I liked the first one. It was a pretty fun game. But this bland sequel is a horrible waste of time. Even after the first 20 minutes, I was already sick of this game and just wanted to turn it off. It's atrociously repetetive, the environments suck, and the camera angles are all skewed making it hard to fight off enemies with some sort of control of your character. There are times when everything on the screen is so far away that you basically need to hold a magnifying glass up to the screen to see what you need to do. A cheap way of getting around poor graphics. And the music just sucked so bad it was almost offensive. Don't even waste your time on this junk heap of worthlessness."
3,strike,"I really love the ninja turtles, so i wanted to have a biast view on this game. But i couldn't, it wasn't really fun, i mean it was ok. But nothing that matched my nastalgic love for the turtles. So, what kept me playing was unlocking the Ninja Turtles Arcade game. But they did not fully redeem themselves there either. I liked replaying the game, and liked the fact that you could keep putting in quarters (as if you had money); BUT you cant choose what turtle you want to be. Which severly sucks, i loved Donatello's special in that game. Instead i'm stuck with Leonardo (my least favorite of the turtles)."
2,Not very good.,Stick with 2D ninja turtles games konami cause they clearly can't make a fun 3d game.
4,Quite ok but,"Great work really, but I would like to see David to release a live-album, I know it would sound better. De las gracias señor Hasslehoff mucho!!"
5,Superb for the Dutch,"I don't understand a word English, so I can only guess what phenomenol wisdom David Beffenhofs lyrics must behold. But the vibes, my god! Only those vibes are enough to drive a man insane with joy! How English speaking people manage to withstand both vibes AND lyrics one can only guess.The song ""Hot Shot City"" is extraordinary."
5,He is simply the best.,"David Hankelbonk is someone who does not call a 'spade a spade', he calls it a 'shovel'. This is evident throughout this latest masterpiece that has me diving through the surface of the lyrical content to discover what is and what could well be.The world is David's lobster, as he has proved time and time again through his career firstly as a man who traveled the frontiers in his talking car and then as Mitch Buchanan, a modern day 'Charles Ingels' on Malibu Beach.His music is as forceful as his TV shows. One walks away from each gem of a song wondering about life and what we can do to make things a little better for ourselves - and boy there are many things! When I listen to his crooning I am taken away to a magical place where only people with clean underpants are admitted. This place is 'Hot Shot City' which is a particularly good song."
5,"A big, towering achievement in our time","A ton of praise is well-deserved for our idol David Hasselblatt. What he has achieved in 1995 is to compile the best of his body of work onto ONE CD. That is amazing. One wonders how many sleepless hours he spent poring over so much great material. How could he choose between so many great hits? What heartbreaking decision was it to pick ""Crazy For You"" over ""Howling While Banging a Frying Pan?"" Was it the limit of CD space that forced him to omit ""Cupping My Hand Under My Arm (and Making Rude Noises?)"" The mind boggles. But what David did decide to include in his Greatest Hits are truly great. These songs are a delightful cross-section of a well-seasoned career in karaoke bars. Congrats to David on his crowning retrospective. The song ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good."
3,Let down?,"I'm more a fan of Hasseldoogs' ""deep tracks"". With that said, I still went ahead and bought the collection based on the glowing reviews here. At the end of the day, most of the songs are passable, but I could do without head-scratchers like ""Hot Shot City"", which I didn't find to be particularly good. Alas, Hashendorf is a living legend, and scrutinizing his catalogue is a fruitless endeavor. No matter how much you nay-say, he will always win. I believe they call that ""the heart of a champion""."
5,All Hail King Hoff,"Dude, the Hoffmeister totally rocks. He's awesome, man, he blows your mind. This album is totally unbelievable. Listening to his majestic tenor tones makes your very soul tingle. His voice is sweeter than honey and the lyrics are sheer poetry. It's as if he's the secret lovechild of Pavarotti and Elvis, with a bit of Shakespeare thrown in for good measure. On top of all this, he single-handedly brought the Berlin Wall down and ended the Cold War. David Halfandhalf, you are my hero.The song 'Hot Shot City' is particularly good."
1,Don't hassle the hoff dudes,"i am assuming that these 5 star reviewers are totally joking. I mean, come on."
1,Puh-leez,"Where do they dig you people up? Words like those I've read here should be reserved for Van Gogh, Beethoven and the like. Not this yoyo. Gte some class. Get some culture. Get a life!"
5,Open your eyes.,"On experiencing this compact disc, ones entire perception of life changes ireversibly. After a single verse of 'Hot Shot City' you suddenly gain the one thing that mankind has been searching for since our creation; - UNDERSTANDING.You open your eyes to the true prupose and meaning of our universe, every historical fact falls into place pointing to this singular moment...Our emergence from the sea, -orchestrated to one day allow a man called FartleHoff to control air-pressure waves in his charachteristic 'lama-sucked-through-a-jet-engine' style.The discovery of electricity, - allowed humans to build complex machines that would one day transmit the songs of 'understanding'.Computers - allowed the creation of the internet, so great companies like Amazon can distribute the experience of the 'knight rider' to the lowly masses.This is what the human body is designed for, it is our destiny, so embrace it and surrender to the power of David."
5,Sweet and glowing tears of joy,"A loveworn mind. A caresick heart. We need. We speak. We hope. We die. We love. There was truth? Yes. Yes we love. From this desert night and this scarred wilderness, aching beauty can transcend our pain. Not a lament of parting but a salutation of a new beginning! A bright and pure confluence of sweetness and energy. We thank you David Hazlecabbage. There is no such thing as pain anymore. Earthly cares and base sorrows are drowned and reborn by the particular goodness of Hot Shot City and we return to Earthly life as Gods."
2,Pure tripe.,"Aside from the groundbreaking, heartfelt work of Track 6 (""Hot Shot City""), there is very, very little merit here. Customers would be much better served to look into ""Very Best Of"" or Mr. Hasselhoff's first, epynonymous work."
5,"A bona fide, no-holds barred coup d'etat from Shangri-La","As a collector of fine music, it always warms my heart to see such well-deserved praise given to one of my favorite singers. People are finally coming around, discovering David Hackerhoffelblank as not only a rocker, but as a balladeer, a minstrel for making out.Why, just the other day I had one of my high school students over for drinks. I put this amazing CD on my hi-fi as she complained about not getting a passing grade and not being able to get into a good college or whatever. Within minutes, we were locked in an embrace, kissing madly and enjoying the 'heat of the moment,' as the band Asia calls it.I have only David Honkerplattentunk to thank for making that such a wonderful night. That music set the tone for the evening, and although Carrie didn't get a passing grade and ended up working at the local VD clinic, she did seem to enjoy ""Hot Shot City."" She even said it was particularly good between sobs."
2,Mullet flapping rock,"I won't harp on about too much of this soft rock nonsense. I just want to point out that the cover of the Motorhead classic - ""Pleae don't touch"" with Kitt and Dave dueting on the vocals is sublime. Worth the asking price for that alone. Rock on David - you're way better than that Richard Marx."
5,Search no more,"I too, have been dazzeled by the brilliant light that emits from David. I have played this CD non-stop since I bought it and have been shocked and even more shocked to find out there is a track 7 on it as my player constantly repeats track 6.My wasted life now makes sense, I have given up cannabis and started on crack cocaine such is the majesty of this album. As each of the first five songs play you can imagine yourself on a deserted beach with David by your side and then a spaceship appears and takes David away leaving you alone and distraught.There should be no other song in the world besides Hot Shot City."
5,YAHTZEE!!!,"Hinkledoff puts this disordered life into order. This unlikely shaman carefully massages the essence of our being with his meticulous execution of cutting edge and experimental drum beats accompanied by eargasmic modulation.Striking a sense of balance rivaled only by William Shatner's rendition of ""You'll Have Time""... Hazzacough cleverly pulls at our souls with his lyrical wisdom.We're hotter than rock'n' rollShe's burning baby in my soulCheck it out, check it outHankamoth paints this lyrical sketch by drawing from real-world experiences that are all to familiar.Standing alone in the spot-light is ""Hot Shot City"". This song is particularly good."
5,Smashingly amazingly jawdroppingly GREAT!,"Eskimos have over 500 words for snow, and I have over 500 words for Hasselhoff being FANTASTIC. I think his vocals are so smooth and amazing, especially after finding out that he used to be the voice of the old Fat Albert cartoons back in the 70's. The musical compositions that he weaves from his abdomen like a spider are silken and complicated, yet oddly touching, so poignant when he sings about unrequited love. It breaks my heart to hear the song ""Flying on the Wings of Tenderness"" to this day, and not just because my husband and I used this as our first dance at our wedding. God bless Hasselhoff for his gifts, and I hope he has another greatest hits compilation in the making. The song ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good."
5,Whaoo,"An hecatomb of hits. Being french I have a special feeling toward ""Je T'Aime Means I Love You"", which by the way is true, ""Je T'Aime"" means ""I Love You""."
4,Hot Shot Hassleshorts,"Imagine my surprise as my ears first happened upon track 6 of this amazing album. Fans may not be aware, but Hot Shot City is a nod at David's years BEFORE he became the ""King of German Pop"". At one point, David starred in a television series starring a talking car. He and the car solved all kinds of thrilling mysteries with the help of their friends Shaggy and Thelma.David often drove the sleek, black car around LA after hours, luring young beauties into the soft bucket seats with promises of stardom and all the bratwurst they could eat. He was the Hot Shot City.I can't wait the release of his double-live album due in the Summer of 2003, ""Hassling the Natives - David Does Dubai"".I love track 6!!All my love,Stinky"
5,"Heaven on Earth, delivered right to my ears","The delicate vocal stylings of Devine Hanselkopf made the hairs on my chest stand up. I couln't believe that the angelic sound emanating from my speakers was from a mere mortal man. I mean, the track ""Hot Shot City"" alone was enough for me to drop to my knees and beg the almighty for more time here on this rock we call Earth so that I may continue to bathe in the glorious sounds of Dingle HeavingHairyChest just a little longer."
4,Hasselhoff........mad genius?,Oh wow....... this record makes me want to drink a bottle of nyquil at 5 in the morning and write letters to an old girlfriend that lives across the villiage from me. It's pure pop sensibilities inspires me to get on an old beat up ten-speed bike and ride across town hollering at anyone that will listen to me about the genius that is David Hasselhoff and then maybe I'd cut off my pinky toes and mail them to a complete stranger.
5,Perfect for all aspiring supervillains!,"I picked up a copy of ""Looking For-Best of David Hasselhoff [IMPORT]"" after a recommendation from one of my subordinates and I must say that it has changed my life completely!Never before did I consider that one single man could be capable of such an amazing orchestration of aural pleasure until I sat down to listen to the music contained upon this simple disc. But the moment my ears beheld the wonder of ""Looking for Freedom"" I realised that such power was indeed possible!If that revelation wasn't enough, the sheer power of ""Crazy for You"" and ""Everybody Sunshine"" was enough to convince me that Sir Waddlehuff was the ultimate power on this planet! His voice is akin to an angel's, screaming out for all to listen to the inspiring and sublime lyrics."
5,"Forget Charlotte Church, David has a voice of an angel.","Ever since seeing David in Knight Rider, wearing his tight jeans, I have been a huge fan of his work, this CD cements his reputation as one of the leading artists in the world today. David is unrivalled in both the acting and pop world, 10 million Germans can not be wrong."
5,C'est Si Bon!,"You gotta hand it to David Hesperchaff. He's endured the tempests and uproars of the music industry of the past 3 years, remaining on top of the steaming heap of pop legend. It's hard to believe that this singer/actor/valet has now been in the public eye for almost 6 years! Quite amazing, really.But what's more surprising about his career is not the length, but the girth. Just listen to ""Flying On the Wings of Tenderness"" and ""Crazy For You,"" and you'll see that he has a keen ear for the melodramatic.The song Hot Shot City is still particularly good."
1,Clearly NOT His Best!,"I see all these golden stars lined up in rows of five and I don't get it. I am utterly confounded as to why so many people find these songs enjoyable. They clearly are not representative of Mr. Hasselhoff's finest work. After all, the album title even states that a search continues for his best! And they expect us to contend with these - his inferior throwaways - for the time being? Well I, for one, refuse. People, you are being had! Can't you see that? They are holding out on us. They are denying us Mr. Hasselhoff's supreme genius, the genius that makes German girls giddy and other Eurobeings froth at the mouth and tie scarves around their heads.I just don't understand. It has been nearly ten years since this cd was released. What is this? Some sort of conspiracy, some sort of subversive and cleverly concealed plot against Americans? What the......OH! I see now that a Very Best collection HAS been released.Never mind......."
1,Too many notes,"When I heard that David Hasselhoff had burst upon the singing scene like a launched summer tomato, I was thrilled. Surely the vocal stylings of this walking carpet of a man would be poor. While I can't call this album ""great"", ""good"", or even ""music"", I found it challenging to say the least. This guy is all over the place! High notes, low notes, squalling notes, howling notes, big and little notes, sometimes all in the same song. This isn't at all what I would have expected from the Man of Sand in Fur. I wish to register my disappointment. I'm sticking with my Tibetan monk chants."
5,Mission complete..,"Everyone knows that the universe is big. It's also obvious that music is even bigger. David, who has undoubtly been given a gift of unfathomable proportions, has managed to compress the universe of music into Looking For-Best of David Hasselhoff [IMPORT]. I just wish this CD was out and was given to me when I was born because after been whisked across the vast expanse of song (on the back of a big rocket powered double clef) I feel that I've blown thousands purchasing music over the years and wasted a significant proportion of my life listening to it. I'm never going to buy another CD again after listening to this, there's no point spending any more of my time seeing if I will enjoy anything more. I mean, what's the point?Even tho there no way to improve on perfection, if I had to choose one track during a moment of madness I would probably conclude that the song ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good."
5,Tops,"What a guy. The Talent this chap has is amazing. Not only does he work for Devon Knight, he's a top singer.If you buy one album this year buy this. With so many top tracks i just dont know which is my favourite.Also Mr Hasselhoff can be seen playing a arcade game in the film Flashdance. This Guy is the MAN!!!!!!!!"
5,thanks Steve,I was put onto this magnificant site by Steve Gibbs a man of impecable taste in music as you can see.
1,"Great, now I'm scarred for life","All these glowing reviews... what's wrong with you people?!?!?! I know I'm only 10 but I know crappy music when I hear it, and this is crappy music. To think I blew a whole weeks allowance on this because of you people. For shame!!!"
4,its getting better man,"well of course people are gonna laugh but , David really can sing , i was really taken back by his range as a recording artist and I must say he can hold a note.its hard to say what the best track is , but i think if i had to choose one it would be....... errr well, it would have to beOpen me up (and come inside) its really good and has a swedish electro beat i really can gun tovery good yes"
1,Best is yet to Come.... I don't think....,"I'd heard so much about this import, that I have to admit that I was disappointed. I thought I would be Fallin' in Love, but this is no way as good as the import Very Best of David Hasselhoff.But I forgive him. The song Hot Shot City is particularly good"
1,david blows...,...my mind that is. with his sultry voice and all. this album is a must have for all baywatch fans.
5,Smashing!,"Oh, oh, David HasselhoffYou make me wanna get my kit(t) offYour curly hairYour sparkling smileYou make me turn my knickers vile"
5,No more War !,"Having listened endlessly to this opus I can only recommend it being played from speakers to Iraq, Iran, North Korea and France to achieve true world peace with all non americans. They may have Kim Dong and Allah and cheese. We have Dave"
5,Teriffic Stuff,"I found this CD at the bottom of my mothers handbag. Along with a tenner out of her purse I ""borrowed"" it and couldnt wait to get back to my room to listen to it.Sadly my CD player was broken so I have based my opinion on the majority of the reviews seen here.So, in summary - its great, go and buy it!"
5,The proof that Jesus did not die in vain.,"When I first heard the music of the Hoff, I was inspired, electrified and convulsed by the sweet sweet harmonies that this uber-entertainer was throwing at me. With tracks like 'hot shot city', 'freedom for the world' and 'do the limbo dance' this album spirals beyond the mere boundries of mortal toil and into the realm of the giant mind hives that rule the universe.Hasslehoff has provided definitive proof that Jesus Christ did indeed die for us all."
5,Well done for getting a knighthood,"I think it is the first time Queen Elizabeth has awarded an honorary knighthood on the basis of one album, but boy is it deserved. What a powerhouse of classic tunes. This man sure can write beautiful music and sing it to perfection, something not even the greatest composers like Bach, Beethoven and Cliff Richard are capable of.I for one will join the throng of fans outside Buckingham Palace, hoping the great man himself will sign my copy!The track Hot Shot City is particularly good."
5,Darwin was wrong. . .,"This album has everything, tubular bells, aboriginal instruments and good old fashioned German pop-rock. ""Riverdance"" watch out. If you have extremely bad taste, or just don't know any better, this album is for you. If I had the choice of laying my hand on an oak table and hitting it as hard as humanly possible with a framing hammer -or- listening to this Hasslesnorf album, I would choose the hammer every single time. At the very least, this album will teach you to hate with creativity and vigor. If for some reason this music would ever break out in the U.S. and become the fad among teens, I would move to Tibet and renounce the world. immediately. Anna Nicole Smith, you have competition."
5,David Hasselhoff....More like God!,"David Hasselhoff has mastered all that is music! Be sure to listen to this album while eating bananas. And Quiche. The song ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good."
5,Sheer Genius.,"How can I describe this album? In a word, divine. Never before and never again will such genius and mastery of the senses coalesce into a body of pure bliss as has in this work of blinding brilliance by David Hasseldorf. Indeed, the words to adequately describe this work are beyond me. I can only begin to break the surface of depths of genius before unknown to man. Song after song of pure harmony fills your ears as your soul becomes light and euphoric. It's quite refreshing, really. I highly suggest you try it.The track 'Hot Shot City' is particularly good."
5,This one deserves five stars,"They say that to play to the blues properly, you have to put yourself in the sufferer's shoes. David Thatherthoff applies that same type of logic to singing pop songs, except that he makes the LISTENER suffer. This unique twist on an old approach is what has made him such an enduringly popular singer for over 3 years.His pop songs are like jalapeno poppers that you get at restaurants where all the waiters wear suspenders with buttons on them. They are easily digestible, flavorful, and have terrible cliché lyrics about 'rockin on a Saturday night.' David is a master chef as he serves these pop songs. He even chews them for you before dropping them in clumps into your mouth. Sometimes you get one of his tooth caps. Yay.That track ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good."
5,DAVID ROCKS THE PLANET!,"David, You are quite surely the greatest almost as good as Radio 1!! Keep it up buddy (I mean how can you not watching Baywatch!)"
1,"He dribbles, he shoots... and it's in!","Frankly, I don't understand what all the fuss is about. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink is a perfectly good forward with a decent record for both Leeds and Chelsea, for whom at the time of writing he had scored 9 goals this season (including a hat-trick against Wolves last weekend).True, the Dutchman has been left out of Holland's provisional Euro 2004 squad, and may not have the most creative or well-executed goal celebrations in the league, but I don't think times are so hard that he's had to record an album, despite 'Hot Shot City' being a particularly good track."
5,The King delivers quality through and through,"This is one of my all time faves.I've always been a big fan of the Haff God from his early days with The Scorpions and latterly his new-found soul direction in Color Me Badd.Although this album showcases a move to a more ""middle of the road"" style, ""Lookin For"" still embraces all of the passion and soul of his wild days.There is such a broad mix of styles that superbly showcase what a talent this man has. From the rabid guitar duelling with both Dave Grohl and Eddie Van Halen, to the superb vocal sparring with Jay-Z and Cristina Aguilera.When he lets things slow down, you can hear Lionel Ritchie and Teddy Prendegast drift through in those silken vocals.Buy this - the party album to end all!"
5,Let's WORK,"""He who cannot draw on three thousand years is living from hand to mouth."" We know Goethe said that but was he able to translate that platitude into art? In a word, no, ..... it took the genius of Denker Haggeltorter to do that. Looking for - Best of Dorman Mungeleter arrests the senses like smelling cat piss on your favourite cushion and jolts you like choking on a nut. Why haven't we heard more of Munkel Damperdink? Is this part of the same conspiracy that deprives us of Status Quo and Cliff Richard? Reading these pages, I'm heartened to see Celebrity Chefs joining the cause. Let's make this movement into a Motion.For the time-poor I recommend Hot Shot City. It's particularly good."
5,A Life Changing Experience,"A tearful reminder that only through pain can you gain.The utter agony of listening to this CD proves worthwhile, since there is no other method better to strengthen one's soul than listening to Dave Horfendorf yodel his way through this collection.Imagine swallowing Drano and shards of glass, and you'll be able to fathom the aural torture this CD puts upon your body.Get this one for the loud neighbors next door!"
5,A Magical Experience....,"Truly mind blowing. It was with a mixture of pleasure and also pain that I switched off my cd player after listening to David's CD for the first time. Pleasure in listening to a voice that truly got me going, and then a crescendo of pain that it had finished. Now that I have this album I can cancel my subscription to escort. I thought track 6 was the highlight of a truly magical music experience."
5,Ahh. The sweet aroma of musk.,"Darver Hankenscoff is truly an amazing onstage presence. Last month at the TV Family Values Tour, I watched him rock out alongside Jaleel ""Urkel"" White and Corey Haim. When Alan Thicke and Lorenzo Lamas joined them for a hearty rendition of ""Born To Be Wild,"" I was in heaven. And I think the crowd at the Eagle Ballroom in Milwaukee agreed with me.But this CD is not a live album. It is a comprehensive collection of Hathecraft's best studio work. From the ethereal ""Do the Limbo Dance"" to the savagely rocking ""Freedom For the World,"" you can definitely appreciate David's full bass voice- a voice that resembles three muskrats mauling a balloon.The song ""Hot Shot City (Live in Berlin)"" is particularly good."
4,an hour into the ethereal hasselhoff - liberation!,"what is to say about dave's latest that hasn't been said already. sublime and ethereal, transitions abounding with slick breaks; the temporal and rhythmic interludes at the end of the fourth track left me breathless. what is more, i have heard that dave's heading back to the good 'ol na to treat us to a show like none other. and i thought the interniciene battle between man and beast was greatest performance i have seen yet! dave has opened up a whole new world of listening for me. look out grammy's!"
5,A gaping hole of artistic triumph,"A gypsy once told me that my words would change the world. After several failed attempts at my novel, I relaxed by listening to the radio. What I heard then would change my life forever: on Live 105 I heard the pounding beats of David Honkertrief.It was then that I realized that the words that would change the world would be THESE words. This very review is what I need to communicate with everyone: that the vocal stylings of David Parchercraft sounds like a hippo getting a lava enema.Also, that gypsy told me that the song ""Hot Shot City"" would one day be particularly good."
5,The Messiah has descended...,Never before hath mine ears listened to a more poignant and awe-inspiring collection of the sweet melodic harmony that is David Hasselhoff. Track number 6 really speaks to the inner depths of my soul and will forever be worshiped until thine ears hear the next great fortelling of wisdom from the Messiah Hasselhoff.
1,Not what I expected.,"So I purchased this, thinking it would include the best of David Hasselhoff. In reality, I got a blank CD-RW. Is this truly the best of the 'Hoff?"
5,"Well cool, the Mozart of our generation","I was, frankly, a little dubious about the music of David Hasselbaink but after ordering this CD from Amazon my opinion totally changed. After waiting 4 to 5 days for delivery I was rewarded with an explosion of music. From the first track to the last this is fantastic. I wouldn't be suprised if people are still listening to this in 100,000 years time, in fact if only one item could survive the distruction of our civilisation it would be this CD (and a CD player obviously!) because it's brilliant. So, here's my advice to you don your leather jacket and gold jewellry and choose ""Looking For:"" as your soundtrack to a night's cruisin' in your soft top around town, duboi!The track ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good."
5,drivel hunkypuff strikes again,"What can I say, its a masterpiece. The dulcet tones of Mr punkelchops echoed around my house bringing neighbours running frantically to the scene, to partake in his, what can only be described as unique style.""do the limbo dance"" had friends crying with what i can only assume was sheer joy - as they stabbed themselves multiple times in the ear drums with chopsticks, such is the effect of Mr flumplkopfs music.To not own this album, is to not have lived. Adrenaline junkies everywhere will revel in the sheer danger of listening to Devils flippenfloppenns music in dolby stereoThe song ""hot shot city"" is particularly good"
5,New element discovered,"Look out oxygen, here comes David! To say that this album is a spiritiual journey though the nether regions of the soul and beyond would not do justice. You have not truly experienced life until you have experienced this music and once you do, it becomes as essential as the oxygen you breath. With such monumental accomplishments as Knight Rider, Baywatch, and now this, we can only wonder what is to come for David. World leader perhaps? Cure for cancer? Nay, these are mere childs play."
5,It's poetry in motion!,"God has many names -- Yaweh, Allah, The Lord, Master, etc. Now he has one more: Hasselhoff. Obviously written by the Creator of the Universe himself, David Hasselhoff's ""Best of..."" CD is the most purely delightful compilation of ""music"" I've ever had the pleasure of listening to. Once again, the Europeans are blazing the cultural trails for the rest of the world. Not since the French lifted Jerry Lewis to the status of arch-diety he holds today have Europeans been so at the forefront of entertainment trends.Also, ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good."
5,Looking For-Best of David Hasselhoff,"This man's music rocks, I especially love 'Hot Shot City', hearing his manly attitude when he sings that song just makes me all warm inside. I can actually feel his hot throbbing tunes rise up inside me reaching a final climax at the end of this album. More peolpe should listen to his songs as they will surely make this world a better place to live in.I have been playing this CD everyday after a stressfull day of work whilst admiring his dashingly good looks on the CD case inlays. I'll have him over any of todays manufactured boy bands, David we love you."
1,Absolute pile of garbage,"The only reason I gave it one star, out of five, is that the field won't allow a '0' entry. David Hasselhoff is the cheesiest ""Musical Artist"" I have ever seen! Not since William Shatner has anyone disgraced the recording industry as notably. This stuff is absolute drivel from beginning to end and I can't believe anyone could even listen to it, never mind enjoy it. To say that he has ""Twice the ruggedness of mortal man"" is demented and that person should be monitored and/or sedated and kept from society. Yeesh!"
1,Thats 14.99 i'l never see again!,"I recently purchased this cd and after an hour or so of audio punishment I realised that this was obviously a spoof cd, and not really meant to be taken seriously, i subsequently took it to a car boot sale where i gave it pride of place displaying a 2.50 sticker, after a slow morning of disinterest I lowered the price to 1.50, after a couple of hours i was ready for going home having sold everything apart from this cd, I was about to take it home again when a man offered me 50p for the cd, after haggling to get at least 1 I bit the bullet and accepted his offer, when i asked the man if he was a fan he replied, no infact you can keep the box if you like I use the blank side of the disks to make novelty clocks! On inspecting the handful of change he had given me I realised he had in fact given me 37p and a 25pts coin! Oh well never mind....."
1,Absolute rubbish!,I am stunned at the prior reviews. Listening to this was less preferable to strangling a cat.
5,"If loving this is wrong, I do'wanna be right","Like a glittering, solid-gold lighthouse in a fog of puke, David Graffenberg lights up the night with his dazzling display of heterosexual pop hits. He seizes the microphone and punishes it (and us) for fifty straight minutes. From ""Crazy For You"" to ""Everybody Sunshine,"" he emanates from your speakers, stinking up your trailer home with pure vocal heaven. Synth beats startle and confuse your house dogs, and the shrill guitar solos arouse the raccoons going through your garbage out back. You meanwhile drown in the utter bliss of David's vocal charms, a voice that your cousin Deke compared to ""three goats kicking a bucket of wolverines."" Your ex-girlfriend once said you would never amount to much. She's right, but at least you're enjoying great music at home. The song ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good."
5,Throw away your Beatles albums!!,"Trust me, nothing else comes close to this work of art that can only be described as PURE GENIUS!!!Mr Hasslehoff has truly taken the art of music onto a different level. He has achieved a level of songwriting and musical acclaim that the Beatles could only dream of. I never knew that music alone could reach into the very depths of your soul and speak to you as if a message from God himself.This collection of songs was also almost entirely responsible for the fall of the Berlin Wall - David, you really have changed the world!I have also grown a Mullet haircut and spent my days pleasuring myself to images of David from my Baywatch and Knightrider video library. I like Baywatch - Mr Hasslehoff looks so dreamy in those tight red shorts and....ugggggghhhhhhhhhh...........oh no!.......does anyone have a tissue??"
4,LOOKING FOR AN END TO THE SHEER BEAUTY OF IT...,"This is an almost impossible review for me to write; the sheer gravity of the beauty of this album equivalent to a pull on the heart strings by a 4KM wide asteroid passing by Uranus and up Venus. In fact it's so good it transcends the collections of other Actor-Switching-Singers and totally eclipses them like a moon. The effect is similar to that of an asthmatic in a dust factory- breathless!It is a collection of titanic tracks metamorphing different musical genres with seamless ease. Rock, pop, folk, techno, hardcore funk, jazz, garage and bhangra-goth; they're all here. Unfortunately the last track is a little weak hence only 4 out of 5 stars."
2,Something for the kids,"""I live in a house built entirely from strands of David's chest hair that I found entwined in a mile of barbed wire around Area 51. Surely this makes ME his biggest fan?"""
4,"Long time admirer, first time listener","What can I say - I almost crapped myself after hearing this album. It's important to note that Dave H's talents are by no means limited to saving drownee's in California, or arguing with a talking car - this guy can warble with the best of them.Yo De Lay E Hoo indeed.I think that if you're a ""soft core"" Hasselhoff fan, this CD will push you over the edge & onto the brink of suicide. And by suicide I mean ""admiration of David 'Hairy Chests are Best' Hasselhoff"".I have read some of these other reviews, and I have reason to suspect they are taking the mickey out of Derek Hasselheimer. WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?This is pure methamphetamine for your brain. It'll widen your horizons, make you more alert and improve that little incontinence problem you've been having.Go Davin Hesslmier - never go back."
5,One track really stands out,"Whilst I wasn't compkleteky blown away by this album, I just had to write in and say that I thought the song ""Hot Shot City"" was particularly good."
3,Not exactly the best,"David Hasselhoff is, as we now know, a giant of entertainment, fit to rank with Elvis Presley, Tom Jones and that bloke who plays the bongos in Wheatus. But who made this selection? Granted, Looking For Freedom has to be here, as anyone who has witnessed thousands of Austrians bopping around in their puffy anoraks, mullets and sausages waving in the air, must realise. But what of DH's legendary duet with the legendary Su Pollard, ""Red Trunks Under A Yellow Coat"". Or his hard-rock take on Black Lace's ""Superman""? Surely this was the right place for his unreleased jam sessions with Damo Suzuki and Aphex Twin to see the light of day.Maybe Volume Two will prove to those few remainly doubters that David is more than just a studly torso with a talking car."
5,.&#65533; Don't fear the Rider &#65533;.,"There really is no need to feel threatened by the work of David Hasperspanglepants. His lyrics are not about killing or shooting you up full of caps and whatnot, and his message is that of peace. To build a singing career around songs of joy and magic is a rare thing these days, especially with the rap-rock and the hippity-hop stuff on the radio. My son was playing the new Lincoln Park CD, and I must say that it was quite a racket!But not so with our dear David H. Soothing, mellifluous melodies fill the sky with his wondrous music, and his voice, oh yea, that voice that calls to mind 2 howler monkeys hitting each other's nethers with wiffleball bats.So don't shy away from the musk emanating from the leather jacket he wears without a shirt underneath. It's the smell of peace. The song Hot Shot City is in there, somewhere, smelling particularly good."
2,Global Peace,George Bush and Tony Blair should listen to this album before invading Iraq. The soothing lyrics may prevent global catastrophe. David Hasselhoff - Peace Maker par exellence.
5,you are mighty,"eternal thanks to you david, i took the plunge and now have a german passport. it was either that or start making a hasseloff skin."
4,"Hey, david is cool!!! Budapest","I am almost tasteing and smelling every niceness of david with these CD.I think he taste of dirty leather and hair, its real good, with talent.I love his singing!! Flying on Wings of Tederness is best.Christianaxxx"
2,I'd rather ride KITT than Brad Pitt.,"The first track is like a rhyming critter who hasn't had food for three days. The second, ""Der Fledermaus Technologik"" is more tender: a love story set in the Ghettoes of Rome that gives vent to Hasselhoff's grim melodrama. As the song reaches its apex, you start to wonder who it is that Hasselhoff keeps calling ""mein spunkchiefer"".After such a serious opening, one is surprised and delighted to hear the mood give way in the middle of the album to a series of operatic follies and early house like the Cookie Crew. Hasselhoff starts to have fun and its much better.Unfortunately the last two songs ""Jagermeister Fluids"" and ""Das Butt"" revert to the ""old jakey"" style. ...It makes for a weeping sore of a finale when it should have been cakes and fireworks. ..."
1,You people have really bad taste......,"I purchased this CD like others before me based on all the great 5 star reviews...I have to say I don't what all the fuss is about, although ""Hot Shot City"" was a really masterful piece of work and ""Je T'aime Means I love YOu"" has its moments too but everything else was utterly disappointing. I am selling it now on ebay. Am I weird for not liking this CD? I am worried......"
1,No Go!,"I'm sorry to say I find his voice irritating and un-human, my girlfriend plays David Hasselhoff to irritate me and unfortunately it works.David hasselhoff for me is just a wannabe, he should have stuck to slow moving shots in Baywatch or Knight Rider.For those of you that have parted with money I feel sorrow, you have very sad and boring lives with no idea of realism or personality, you are slaves to Hasselhoff.My hat goes off to David for being so digitally processed and without any soul or skill.Hands together for Mr slow mover.... I think not"
5,An overlooked psych-prog masterpiece,"This lost classic of the Hoff's early career finds the onetime personification of all things sandy and beach trading his hot rods and Speedos for Mellotrons, synths, and sci-fi imagery. Influenced by such early 1970s German innovaters like Can and Amon Duul II, Hoff began to explore ambient soundscapes, turning the beach into a frightening metaphor for the polluted, defiled, oily underside of Southern California life--not unlike Gary Numan turning the car into a symbol of isolation and paranoia. The fusion of Teutonic and California romantic was difficult listening for the Hoff's fans. Even more confusing, he chose to embrace the homoerotic via his brief cameo in ""The Spongebob Squarepants Movie."" The album is still debated among hardcore Hoffites. To them, the album is either Hoff's ""Tonight's the Night"" or his ""Tales from Topographic Oceans."" The only thing anyone can agree upon is that ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good."
5,"Better then Elvis, The Beatles, or Zamfir & his pan flute","There are no words that can do this CD justice. You have GOT TO GET THIS CD. Elvis, The Beatles...second rate compated to the mind blowing sounds. He is truly the musical talent of all time."
4,Wow!,"I have owned a different best of the Hunklehaff CD for some years now and have to agree that the man is a genius.Sadly this best of does not feature the full 8 minute mix of Night Rocker, my favourite track. Thankfully, the rather excellent Hot Shot City more than makes up for it."
5,Haffenpheifer Strikes Again!,"When I was just a lass, I spent a memorable summer in Quebec City. Although I couldn't speak a word of French, mumbling into my hand seemed to get my point across just fine. And so it is for the immortal David Halfnhalf. Though German by descent, his braying tenor sends all mankind into writhing aural ecstasy.In ""Looking For- Best of David Hasselhoff [IMPORT]"", I can only compare his voice to that of a sick weasel being dredged in flour by an angry two-year-old. Add to this his possibly synthetic mane of curly locks, his aging-yet-still-not-bad body, and his past association with a talking car and you end up with rock and roll's indisputable king, or should I say fuhrer.Darvin Hackysack, this time you've outdone yourself, and might I add that your paean ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good."
5,Like a Michael Knight in shining armor,"Let's face it. David Hasselhoff is a STAR. He has mastered the little screen, the big screen, the silver screen, and now the German pop music screen, whatever that is. His contribution to the world of song can be matched only by that of Barbra Streisand or Bad English. A man with a plan, he soulfully croons his way through 28 delightful songs about sex and men. His heterosexual voice is like a clap of gas in a room full of asthmatics. Songs he touches turn to a warm, yellowish liquidy gold. The kind of gold that travels in a long stream. The song ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good."
5,the john lennon of our time,"not since millivanilli has an artist been so ridiculed, yet so underrated and unappreciated. david hasselhoff is the john lennon of our time, able to unite people with his music all over the world. after listening to this record i can honestly say i am a better person, and its all thanks to one man who dared look for freedom. thank you david for sharing your gift with one little german girl, and the universe."
5,A one of a kind singer in a million to one shot to fame,"The main reason I love David Chankerpores so much is that he is a real CLASS ACT. He doesn't go along with current trends of hard rock mixed with hip hop. He goes against the grain when it comes to songs about death and self-loathing. He even eschews the current convention of singing in tune, preferring to screech and belch out the lyrics like a hysterical wildebeest caught in a corn thresher. One of the many innovations he has brought to pop music is the introduction of singing not only out of tune, but completely out of rhythm to the music; the end result is a jarring syncopation that makes people pull their cars over and vomit, and causing multiple fatalities at dentists' offices. My favorite song has to be ""Crazy For You,"" although even I have to admit that the song ""Hot Shot City,"" beyond its initial shallowness and basic melody- and even withstanding its apparent lack of structure after the second verse- is particularly good."
5,Doughnuts: Discuss,"Doughnuts will get you through times with no money better than money will get you through times with no doughnuts. Life is like a box of doughnuts....... mmMMMmmmm....doughnuts. Assuming the word doughnut means a nut made from dough, should there not also be doughbolts? doughscrews? Doughnut or donut? That is the question!"
5,The Ubermeister!,"For me David Hassleblade is he human embodiments of a god, the God of Rock.If he lived over here in England he would be royalty King & Queen David the First! If only my dream could come through and then his face would be printed on our 5,10 & 20 pound notes - in fact all the currency. Maybe in the future those crazy scientists at Hasslebanhoff Labs will be able to infuse our money with both his image and music - musical money that i can sing along to!!"
5,David du bist der Weltmeister!!!!!,"I am in korea looking at the world championship and this CD is true inspirational for my team in korea. Number 2 track "" Wir Zwei Allein"", represents to us the true fight for the Weltmeisterschaft between Germany and Brasil as it is just us two alone.Numer 6 song: Hot Shot City is just the beste track since Bettina won the eurovision song contest in 1982. The voice, the organ von Bontempi and the sehr fashionable hair fashion, makes herr David the best Suerstar of Rock.The album is sehr,sehr inspirational and will help you feel to good and happy. Danke Schon David and because of you on Sunday we win the championship!!!!"
5,A POWERFUL TRIBUTE,"PLEASE DISREGARD THE ""VARIOUS ARTISTS"" CATEGORY THAT IS LISTED. THIS IS A GRANDLY COHERENT STATEMENT FROM FOUR IMPROVISERS THAT PAYS TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE SPIRIT OF THE LATE ALBERT AYLER. KONDO'S TRUMPET PLAYING IS THE MOST FIERCE BRASS AND ELECTRONICS ATTACK I HAVE EVER HEARD. IT IS ALWAYS REWARDING TO HEAR DRAKE AND PARKER PLAY TOGETHER AND BROTZMANN CLEARLY SHOWS HIS RESONANCE WITH AYLER AS WELL AS HIS OWN VOICE ON THIS DISC."
4,A Brutal assault!!!,"I purchased this album because a guy in the cd-store told me: Do you wat to hear to some brutal and fast metal? Get this!I bought it and played it on my car... OHH my God! The first track is an introduction which is not that important, but then... MAYHEM! I mean, I like Heavy Metal to be fast, raw, brutal but yet melodic (maybe that is not going to make sense). Well, the fact is that this guys from Misteltein are insane!Their music is violent, satanic (yes, a lot of blasphemy) and at the same time: Beautiful.The singer screams as if he is being tortured with a knife, the guitars are just furious, and the drumming is unholy! I highly recommend this CD to those who like bands as Cradle of Filth, Dimmu Borgir or Dark Funeral (as myself). Misteltein sounds as a mixture of those bands I just mentioned.The only flaw is that the last 3 songs of the album are not as good as the first ones, so that is why I am giving it 4 stars.Favorite tracks: Completition, Where angels no more roam"
5,Looking for something similar to Dimmu Borgir?,"Here is your answer. Misteltein hail from Sweden, and have presented their debut album for us metalheads on a platter of leather and spikes. Every so often, an album impresses me to the point that I absolutely must inform my fellow blackmetallers. This debut is truly exceptional. Misteltein could possibly be considered Dimmu Borgir's little brother because they have similar writing styles (Enthrone Darkness Triumphant era). There is also some Cradle of Filth present, but without the emotional intensity...so let's say Hecate Enthroned, and maybe some Mactatus. The musicianship of Mistelstein is of the very best (what did you expect, they're from Sweden), and the production is crystal clear..."
5,Great Book!,I love this book. It's a great little devotional. It's packed with good info and always back up by scripture. Greg Laurie is a very intelligent man of God. I definately recomend this!!
3,"Good stories, but not for a ""short"" devotional",These stories are a bit too long for my wife and I to do prior to getting ready for work.
5,Breakfast with Jesus,This is one of the most inspiring devotional type books I have ever read. It is very-- to the point. It gets better every day. I would and have recommmend it to anyone.
2,Disjointed Minor Novel Of Adventure,"This work, one of a small body of published novels by Canadian Hiscock was published in 1960, and failed to develop a following of enthusiasts. This is readily understandable following a complete reading of this edition. The author, as with his other pieces, fails to manage basic character development, both the protagonist and secondary characters having scant appeal. This yarn depicts one Collins, who is returning to merchant marine life after a substantial absence. Reasons for this absence, and indeed much else within the narrative, are treated but shallowly. Included in this data shortfall are such basic plot elements as the ongoing locations of the action and motivations of the characters. When such weaknesses are combined with trite dialogue and cliched episodes, the book is after being a chore to complete. Hiscock's decline into an Orwellian memory hole has become only logical. Not recommended."
3,Good that Tina is back,"It's good to see that Tina is back. She tried it so often with B.O.Y., Sweetbox, ZZMusic etc and really deserves a comeback. The tracks are still very pop-ish which is good for the Japanese market but a bit outdated for the European market. It still reminds of Sweetbox but with less rap."
1,"Mass produced, commercial junk","Read above, as this product is not even worthy of having the name ""Goat milk Soap."""
2,Not ALL vegetable based and contains PRESERVATIVES!,"Although this soap does appear to get rave reviews, I have a problem with the fact that it is not ALL vegetable based(has Tallow)and it contains preservatives(DMDM Hydantoin-which releases formaldehyde into the product!!!,Tetrasodium Etidronate). Luckily, through my searching I have found WendyLou's Natural Milk Baths and Soaps. They are homemade, with the glycerin still retained and are all natural based with either essential oils or fragrance added. I have very dry skin and her soaps feel so moisturizing and have a great lather, plus its nice to know I am using something without any chemicals."
5,lafian,"Lp shaker, as a percussionist from Nigeria, I am loving it; lovely tone that cuts through in my live performances. Though cheaper that it's richness, I can pay more for the value I receive. In naija language I say ""Amazon una the best!"""
3,Good sound - easily breakable!,"Got this in the mail on a Friday morning. Had a gig that night, during the first tune I was shaking and it sounded great - I tend to use shakers to hit cymbals whilst shaking... anywho... I did that and the thing exploded sending ballbearings everywhere - comedy.Great sound though, going to order another and tape the ends."
4,Latin Percussion Shaker,"Soft, pleasant sound. It is a slender silver metal can with something like B-B's inside and black caps on the ends."
5,Good,This CD rules! Get it if you see it. I found three copies at a used record store for a buck each. The second cd isn't worth getting though- too much of the same rock beats- none of the inventive beats and harmonies of the first cd. It's called Go- don't get it.
5,A tasty slice of '90s power pop,"What a wonderful album. Not one boring or dragging song. Just one loud, guitar-driven, danceable tune after another. And any band that dares Oasis to an ""***-kickin'"" is fine by me. Oh, and after a long pause, there's a bonus track..."
4,Bitter Sweet,"Mintz provides a fascinating history of sugar, placing it in context within the transatlantic world. Sugar acquired ever increasing importance as the means for its production improved, its availability spread and its price decreased. Underpinning the success of sugar was the tragedy of slavery. Not only did slaves serve the sugar plantations and mills, but Mintz makes a compelling case for sugar's being the single key force behind the firm establishment of black slavery in the western hemisphere."
4,Bought for a college course.,"I received my book within a couple of days, the front cover isn't the same as the one on the website, but I don't really care about that. The book itself was sort of bland, but still a fairly good anthropological read."
4,Full of decadence and sweet intrigue,"We so often take sugar for granted, discounting its complex historical power and the histories of those responsible for its production, distribution, and commonplace existence in the marketplaces of today. After reading this book you will never again look at sugar in the same way. An interesting read and good resource-Mintz does it again."
3,Mixed results,"This book could have been so much more. While Mintz presents a wealth of information on a surprisingly important topic, his writing is overly detailed and disorganized."
2,Could have fooled me...,"I never would have believed that you could fill a 275 page book on such a seemingly mundane subject as...sugar. There is a lot of (interesting) history on the subject, but this book didn't really inspire me to respect sugar as anything more than what it is...um, sugar. It definitely explores every little tangent on the subject in colonial history...which might be a bad thing. It gets a little repetitive."
4,How meaning morphs depending on class,"Mintz's book is a bit hard to understand because he approaches the history of sugar from an intensely anthropological perspective. Basically, he studies the meaning associated with sugar (especially in England) during its centuries-long journey across time and economic class. Sugar began as an upper-class commodity. To have sugar displayed one's wealth and status. It was even endowed with magical and medicinal properties. Through colonialism, however, sugar was supplied to England cheaply and it became an daily part of the lower class English diet. It lost its high-status connotations and became a common day product. Mintz also studies the meanings sugar had in literature and speech, and even its effects today. This book is a worthwhile endeavor, and for anthropology, actually almost a fun read."
3,good but not the best,"This book is good. But the masterpiece on this topic is by Noel Deerr, ""The History of Sugar"". In the Deerr book the exhaustive research on the ancient history, colonial period, as well as current (up to 1949 information publishing date) remain unmatched by the other books on this subject. I had to track it down in the University of California Agricultural library."
2,Chevy 350 and 400 (Musclecar and Hi-Po Engine Series),"The book is very informative (on the basics) for the beginner. There are many new high pro parts that came into the market from the time the book was printed (1991) leaving it out of date. But....There are many good explanations on why a part was used, this will help a person to make a better decision on what part to go with themselves. There are a lot of good pictures, diagrams and technical notes to help, also many phone numbers to call for parts and help. 21 projects in all, if you have a 350 - 400 Chevy and need to find out where to start this is a good place to go to get some ideas. Over all I like the information presented in this book for the year it was written."
5,Apprentice of the Heart,"If you have a desire to wrap yourself in nurturance, to assimilate feelings so deep to have been without explanation and to soothe your heart with calm understanding - then indulge yourself in Apprentice of the Heart."
1,Huh?,"I think I must have missed the part in the description of the book about this being a bunch of sappy poetry. Wow, was I disappointed to get this book in the mail and realize I wasted my money. Boooooooring."
5,Incredible find!,"I love this Bible. It is the original 1966 publication, the New Testament only. Hardcover. With the footnotes as well. It is the Bible used by Mother Angelica."
1,What milk bath?,I have yet to receive the foaming milk bath. The product in the container was actually lotion even though the label on the wrapping indicated it was milk bath. Twice I have had to return it and I still have not been credited with the return. I'm not real happy with this particular order.
5,Two Natives of Vienna...,What is not made clear in Amazon's listing of this most excellent disc of rare art is the fact that Schubert's en'tr acte music from Rosamunde is here presented in Schoenberg's 1902 piano reduction for four hands. Remarkable!
2,"50% moderately useful info, 50% personal rant","I enjoyed about 50% of this book. The author gives some good practical explanations of why materials, such as the hull of the Titanic, fail. As a layperson, I found this very interesting. However, I found his personal rants about the politics of scientific research and his personal tales of life in graduate school and beyond really, really tiresome. In addition, the title and book cover (a picture of a bridge failure) are a come on which have almost nothing to do with the contents. The science in the books moves from the macro to the micro, which makes a certain amount of sense but I found the topics to be really poorly organized. I would not recommend this book unless you have lots of free time."
2,Way too focused on the author's personal life,"This book contains a few interesting interludes, but keeps coming back to the author's personal history. Where he went to the graduate school and the people he met there, where he was when the Challenger exploded, and so on. It's more of an autobiography than anything else.For much better presentation, look at J.E. Gordon's books, particularly the New Science of Strong Materials."
5,Required Reading for ALL Engineers!,"I can't say enough positive things about this book. It should be required reading for all engineering students graduating, and I encouraged students to read it when I was teaching statics and dynamics. It explains the technical aspects of material failure in clear, concise terms.One example is the explanation of embrittlement that occurred in the steel that was made for the HMS Titanic, and the resulting failure in the cold seawater. Another example is the explanation of the booster rocket O-ring failure that led to the tragic Challenger explosion. I could go on, but read the book. You won't be disappointed."
3,Some good points...,"The book is a good treatise on material analysis, with the attendant dryness you might expect. Dr. Eberhart injects some humor, but at the level you might expect from a research scientist. As for the analyses of the three failures mentioned in another review, there is scant information provided. In his summary of the failures, he makes references to some facts that are not explained, and leaves the reader curious, unsatisfied. (Example - the decompression flap in the Aloha flight. Why was it opening? What triggers it to operate?).Probably a bit esoteric for the average reader without any background in materials."
4,"A good read, but never answered the question",As an engineer I enjoyed reading this book. However the author never answered the question that he asked in his title... why things break.
3,Good but not great,"Having just read the book, I agree with other recent reviewers. There is interesting information in here (for instance, that lexan becomes extremely brittle when exposed to nail polish remover). But that content is diluted with personal rants (such as the author's grad school interview process) and silly analogies (like ""If even a tiny scratch were to expose niobium to air at 2,500*F, it would soak up oxygen faster than Bounty--the 'quicker picker-upper'--soaks up water."")And the photo on the cover IS completely misleading--the book is about fractures on a micro scale. You won't find anything about why the bridge in the photo broke."
2,"Starts Promising, Ends Up Whiny","This book starts promisingly. The introduction to materials science from prehistoric toolmaking is fascinating, and coupled with fun anecdotes about the author's childhood interest in materials. It's fun to hear about the way he tortured a shatter-proof bowl into breaking, and to get a very readable explanation of the science of what went on.What's not fun is the account of his later career. While at the very end he reveals that he meant this account to be a critique of the American system of funding technological research, it comes off as a whiny account of why the author didn't get the post-docs and grants and academic respect he should have gotten. It's the worst sort of academic pomposity.On the other hand, he manages to make some complicated science about materials fracture quite understandable and interesting. So if you want to learn about that, then get the book and skim through the parts about the author."
2,Largely obsolete now (2009),"I didn't notice that this pocket reference was still in its first printing, from January of 2002. As such most of the content is now obsolete. Specifically the author devotes a lot of space to comparing the Rule-Based and Cost-Based Optimizers, and points out the clear superiority of the latter. This was big news when Oracle 9i was about to be released, not so much now.As to the rest, there are 22 pages (out of merely 102) enumerating the many hints one can apply to SQL. There's not much here that isn't already available from Oracle documentation directly."
5,A Brief study of the Biblical and Historical roots for Believer's Baptism,"A very engaging 36 page examination of the biblical and historical rootsfor believer's baptism by immersion. Now in it's third printing, this booklet is available from the author at 315 Albany Avenue SE, Orange City, IA 51041. Telephone 712-737-6414. [..]. He would like to make it available through Amazon."
2,Cheaply Made,Item is very cheaply made worth about $3.00. I wear a size 8 men's shoe and it barely fits my foot. Also the seam is very noticeable. Afraid to wash if they shrink wouldn't fit my 5 year old grandson.
5,Wonderful shirt,"I am very impressed with the quality of this shirt, particularly given its price. The fabric is soft and light (but tough), the collar maintains its shape well (I've washed it many times already in the few months I've had it: my toddler is not very tidy), and the collar fits well around my son's neck without choking him. I'll definitely be getting one in the next size up when the time comes."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This book, like so many other books about astral projection, provides zero practical instruction. Yram provides information about his experiences and philosophies concerning the higher planes, but nothing on how to achieve OBE (out of body experience). Don't waste your money. Ophiel's ""Art and Practice of Astral Projection"" is the best practical book I've encountered. If there is another I'd like to know about it."
1,Numerous Errors,"I went through this entire book two times and found numerous errors through out the book. Some involve the wrong answers, others have the wrong (conflicting) rationale. The questions covering pharmacology are terrible. I think that for $50+ you should not have to worry if you are retaining the wrong information.I bought NCLEX-RN Questions and Answers Made Incredibly Easy. Although the questions aren't as technical as the ones found this book, they are still pretty good. More important, I have not found any errors."
4,A Happy Delight!,"If you are looking for charming, heart-felt, quirky tales of misadventure, Orson Bean's autobiography can surely pacify you. Bean is an amazing character that has the power to lift the spirit with his blantant charm and lust for life. His stories are outright wonderful. This is simply stated, honest book. A real gem."
2,"Good content, but not enough and very pricey","I was looking for a book that would help customers step into the role of a project sponsor, so I thought this book might be helpful. After I received it, I was surprised at the ""shortness"" of the book, both in number of pages and the size of the margins. This was especially true given the price of the book.There is some good content here, and it might be helpful. I do believe there are better, less expensive, and more comprehensive alternatives to this book..."
5,"Practical, Thorough, Readable","This guide, useful for both Project Sponsors and Project Leaders, covers the roles and activities of Project Sponsors thoroughly, from project inception to completion. While covering a lot of ground, there are not a lot of words--definitions are brief, and the book is full of checklists. I found this to be particularly helpful considering how busy most business leaders are. This is a book that can be opened to a particular spot and used in the moment it is needed. No wading through long chapters to find the nuggets--the book is a compilation of nuggets! Another useful section is the one covering common problems that project teams can run into, and how the project sponsor can help. Again, brief and practical sections covering a description of the problem, possible causes, and things to try."
1,The author shouldn't review their own book!!!,I am concerned about the published review as it looks like the author has given his own book a 5 star rating.
5,amazing stuff!,"I like the powder form. I use it for our outdoor 5,000 gal. pond w/ Koi fish and plants. Safe to all. Use this systematically and you will keep your fish at the optimal PH level to avoid sudden disasters that as you know- WILL happen to anyone. Trouble free. AND you cannot overdose. A must for pond owners."
2,For Beginners Only - Not Very Deep!,"Cheap budget video. I have read and studied real estate off and on over the years and this DVD mainly focuses on low-budget touch-ups to do to a cheap tiny foreclosure for flipping. It claims to have insights as to Where to find Foreclosures - but if you can't find them without tripping over them - this video won't be of much more help.And later at the end, Carlton supposedly interviews a married couple about their investing - Mike and Francine (sp?). The wife looks like a nice person - and Carlton Only Directs All of his questions to Mike the husband. Francine looks pretty and all dolled up - and seems to be very nice - But Carlton Completely Ingnores her!! Treats her as if she wasn't even there.I picked this DVD up for like a dollar - it might be worth that much.And I think 2 stars is being generous! Buy something else - is my advice. Scott M."
2,4 player mode,"I played this game for 5 minutes and i realized that this game is basically just hitting enemies and thought the makers of the game thought all they needed to do was put in a 4 player mode and the game will be good. So only get this game if you are willing to play with a friend, but if your usually alone get a cartoony game like paper mario and the thousand year door it's great."
3,Well,"Once again I oly got this game for the arcade classic, but the music was not very entertaining at all that I mute the tv on the arcade classic. The game overall is nothing really speicail, just standdard, but not very enjoyable. It was fun the first time, but after a while it got boring."
1,REALLY BAD!!!,"The Problem with this game is that I had more fun in the 30 minutes it took to finish the classic ""TMNT"" arcade game (and playing it) than i did in the reist of the game. Now while they did town down the anoying catchohrases, and there is now 4 player mode there is still some major problems. Picking up objects is needlessly complec. tricky jumps seem to require more luck than skill, the camera is just crap. Boss battles are tedious the vechile mission are reminisant of the enter tha matrix driving (which sucked). And the actually fighing in this game is a big joke. All of thouse reason make this game just S**T*The ""TMNT"" arcade is an unlockable in the game"
4,Return to the Days of Yesteryear,"As others have noticed, this is typical of Saturday morning cartoon fare, with limited voice and production values.But, for the children of the 80's, this is a wonderful flashback to the days of yor.Episode list:The Germ,The Viper Is Coming,Spell Of The Siren,Cobra Quake,Captives Of The Cobra Part 1,Captives Of The Cobra Part 2,Bazooka Saw A Sea Serpent,Excalibur,Worlds Without End Part 1,Worlds Without End Part 2,Eau De Cobra,Cobra Claws Are Coming To Town,An Eye For An Eye,The Gods Below,Primordial Plot,Flint's Vacation,Hearts And Cannons,Memories Of Mara,The Traitor Part 1,The Traitor Part 2,The Pit Of Vipers,The Wrong Stuff,The Invaders,Cold Slither,The Great Alaskan Land Rush,Skeletons In The Closet,There's No Place Like Springfield Part 1,There's No Place Like Springfield Part 2."
5,A great dvd boxset for my collection,"I was so happy to purchase this dvd boxset, i love it when i a cartoon is released as a boxset instead of a few episodes on 1 disc. This is one of the greastest cartoons ever to be made and i am grateful for its release. If you are a hardcore GI JOE fan as i am, then you will want this boxset in your collection."
2,Dary Misses The Trail,"What should have been an exciting book about a place central to the mythology of the West is instead a boring compendium of facts.Dary commits the cardinal sin of storytelling by not placing his details and facts in a narrative context. His book is essentially a time-line on which he hangs dates, names and numbers like so much laundry left to dry. There is no perspective, drama or insight. This book was a big disappointment."
4,"Go West, Young Men","I was fascinated by this review. The three Aull boys were born and grew up in our house in New Castle,Delaware and one wall still bears scars of their early experiments with their father John's compass. It gave flesh to earlier sketches of their lives and explained how James probably came back for his mother and sisters when he came to Philadelphia for supplies. The church records say ""moved to Missouri in 1833"". I'm hoping to find more information about the family from Missouri records. The whole saga would be worth a special by Ken Burns. Please thank the author for me."
1,A Trail to Nowhere,"Life on the Santa Fe Trail was no doubt dramatic and colorful, but you would not know it from this book. More than 300 pages of stitched together factual recitations and short anecdotes, the narrative lacks any central characters, themes, or ideas. None of the individuals featured in the book survives more than a few pages, and just as a story starts to draw in the reader, it ends, only to be followed by another quite similar episode, and another and another. Great events dominate the times, but the book seems to separate life on the trail from those events, making the trail itself seem to be almost boring, which it surely was not. The largest contribution this book can hope to make is to point another writer to promising source material with which to bring the story of this trail to life."
1,Boring and Slightly Offensive,"Reading this book was like slogging down the Santa Fe Trail in the 1830's. Occasionally, the author gives excerpts from diaries and letters that bring life on the trail to life. But generally, what he seems to view as important are factoids: how many wagons there were in the caravan, how much merchandise it carried, and the value of the goods. Each caravan gets a dutiful few paragraphs summing it up.The offensive part is the treatment of conflict with the Indians. It's straight out of old Western movies - caravans are attacked by whooping columns of Comanches. There's no attempt at understanding the conflict, even from the point of view of the whites. Just savagery. I didn't think this sort of history was still being written."
5,Haujobb is reality,"One of my favorite Haujobb CDs, more developed than Homes and Gardens, but not worse than Solutions. I enjoy this CD more than Solutions actually. There is just something about this one, very atmoshpheric and moody. A great night time album. Haujobb doesn't dissapoint."
4,I'm Not Being Fed,This is the second copy I have purchased as gifts. This is very good reading for Catholics and anyone else interested in learning more about the Catholic faith and the Eucharist.
4,Very good effort. Very very very very depressing music,"Nearly all their songs are very depressing, and not very fast. Even their single ""Wait"" which is fast is depressing. If you liked ""Wait"" then you will feel home with the other songs."
4,stop comparing them to tool !!!!,"okay,i can't lie i did buy the last album because the lead singer kinda sounds like maynard james keenan.but,if you can't tell the difference then that's a problem.no one should start listening to this band expecting to hear tool or a perfect circle.they are TOTALLY different bands,with totally different sounds.now,earshot is a great band,if they weren't i wouldn't have their stuff.but,to keep comparing them to tool is annoying-there is no comparison,other than maynard and wil's voice.buy this album if you want to hear good music,with some meaning.but of course, if you want to get it because you heard it sounds like tool that's fine because you're probably gonna be disappointed."
4,Great CD!! Better than the first release,"I'm not really into writing huge, dramatic ratings but I'd like to say this CD was definately worth the wait. If you liked their first release definately check this out!! If you're just hearing them for the first time either CD is the way to go. I'd suggest to buy both just to be on the safe side."
3,Not much new here.,"I admit that I brought this cd just from hearing ""Wait"" one time, but I also remember one of my friends playing ""Get Away"" from their first album a while ago and that gave me even more reason to give this band a try. While not a bad cd, nothing really seems to stand out after ""Wait."" Tongue-tied is good, but in my opinion things just mellow out too much for my tastes until the end of the cd. I would suggest giving this a preview listen at this site or at an in-store listening station before buying."
1,What happened?,"I am not one to criticize beyond giving constructive advise. I bought Earshot's ""Letting go"" when it first came out and I liked it because they had something original going and their music had quite a bit of emotion.It's 2006 and I just stumbled upon their second release. What happened? Where did Earshot run off to? This album is not close to their first in any way and quite frankly it sounds like one long drawn out waste of studio time.I wonder how they feel about it. I'm not impressed. I see that some people were and I wish I could see why because every song sounds the same to me. It feels like they were shooting for eleven hits and missed.. like they tried to be every other popular band out there. Earshot you have really let yourself go with this one."
3,Standard Rock...Doesn't Break Any New Ground,"I stumbled upon Earshot through the Amazon reccomendations system, and while they give a good effort, there are a ton of other rock bands which sound just like them. This is simply standard affair rock, no bells and whistles, just another medium hardness rock band clone.Its not that this CD is horrible, just, as a whole it is easily forgettable. None of the songs really stick with me, and I go away from this album wondering why I listened to all of the tracks in the first place. There are a few pretty good songs on this CD, with ""Wait"" the standout track on this disc. Several of the songs become annoying, plagued by repetetive choruses and a sense that the guitarist only knows a few chords.In the end, if you're into the whole medium heaviness rock, a la Hoobastank, Incubus, Buzzhorn, Switchfoot etc. then you might want to pick up this CD. Otherwise, the simple lack of any innovation and the repetition of style from track to track wrecks this album."
2,nothing special-just typical radio rock,"earshot has the potential to really be a great band with an amazing lead singer sounding similar to maynard james keenan and a talented rhythm section.even armed with this ability,the band tend to fall flat.the whole album is mellowdrone, with all the songs blending right into each other and you cant even tell them apart.a few standouts include ""wait"" and ""tongue tied"" and ""someone"" is ok.the rest of the songs are quite boring.good vocal talent, although he could do more.all in all,if you like the glossed up and radio ready stuff, you will adore this album.otherwise,take a listen to their debut ""letting go"" which was heavier and more raw."
4,Not TOOL,"I just got this cd - and it usually takes a couple weeks for me to feel an album out completely. This is a very sold album.If you are getting this album because you like TOOL, and people have told you they sound like TOOL - you'll be disappointed. Maynard James Keenan may have a similar voice, but he outranges this dude any day. Maynard can play with your emotions.This music doesn't give you that same dose of musical genius that anything Maynard got his hands on would ever give you.However, most fans of non-commercialized rock music would enjoy this album. Earshot displays signs of maturity throughout ""Two"".If it is more Maynard you are looking for, check out ""eMOTIVE"" by A Perfect Circle. It features a lot of covers that for the most part are almost completely re-arranged (they sound nothing like the originals). I've heard mixed reviews personally, but give this one a few good stoned listening sessions and you've got another album you can't seem to take out of your cd player.PEACE"
3,Worst Of 2004,"Out of all the bands of 2004 (Damageplan, Flaw, Atomship, and Earshot) Earshot is the worst. Buy the Damageplan, Flaw, and Atomship CDs instead. The only good songs on this are ""Wait"" and ""Someone"". The other songs are forgettable filler. Don't get me wrong, I own this CD, and I'm going to keep it just because ""Wait"" and ""Someone"" are good songs. If you're confused then just buy this CD if you have extra money after you buy the Flaw, Damageplan, and Atomship CDs. There can only be one Maynard, and he sings for Tool and Perfect Circle. The singer for Earshot is good, but he can never be Maynard."
3,30' cotton dog lead,"I have 3 of these and use them all the time for walking my hounds. The price was fine, but the shipping was the same as the price, making an $8.99 lead close to $18!These leads hold up well. Oddly, though, I bought 2 of the leads 8 years ago on the same day, from the same company, but one started shredding and the other is still like new and I use them almost every day.This new one I bought isn't as good a quality, but it will do."
5,A Lush Guilty Pleasure,This is so beautifully rendered it is unbelievable and the story itself is brillient.A must have for any comic fan.
5,I'm proud to own it,"The edition is simply beautiful, the presentation an quality is really good, the only thing I don't like much is that the pages are glued, not stitched, I would even pay more if there was another version with that feature, that would make it REALLY an ABSOLUTE edition. Nevertheless the pages looks solid and if you handle the book as it deserves, the pages won't come off."
5,Birthday Gift,"I bought this as a birthday gift for my brother, he loves it. It is great quality and has great graphics."
5,Sandman at its finest (re-read 10/10),"As a longtime Sandman reader, I found this volume to be everything I could ever desire in an Absolute Sandman. This book collects all of the first 20 issues of the landmark series, has re-colored 18 of the 20 issues (this is a HUGE upgrade) from and of the old trades. Trust me, if you are reading anything but the Absolute Edition, you are missing out on a lot of detail and pleasant art. And if you don't care about art (like I don't), you will still find the stories more enjoyable. This book will look good on your shelf, the spine will not break when you lay it flat, and if you ever enjoyed Sandman at all, you will love this series. Just think, these are the weakest issues of the series. Can't wait for Vol 2 and 3!Re-readability: 10/10*I always put re-readability in my reviews for people who like to keep their TPB to re-read*"
3,Don't open this book if you like your binding,"Sandman is my favorite story ever and the pages of this book are beautiful and seem like really nice quality. Amazon was nice enough to send me damaged books (Corners were dented and covers scratched. I guess they throw the books around). I was too excited to send them back though which was a mistake. Its best if you don't open the books more than say... 6 inches though since the cheap binding will break. I read somewhere here they were glued. Do yourself a favor, save your money and buy the paperbacks.If the binding was good and it arrived undamaged I wouldn't be able to give it enough stars."
4,Not for the squeamish,"There are some horrific stories here and some wonderful ones, but all throughout the story telling is great, even if Gaiman looks back today and sees some awkwardness and clumsiness. I especially enjoyed reading the proposal for the Sandman comic series, as it gave me a real taste for how extensive an outline can be while allowing a great deal of room to flex and follow inspiration wherever it leads."
5,What follows is a series of remarks addressed to the readers of this review and about this book itself,"Whoa... Were do i begin?Let me start by saying, I would recommend to anyone to read some of the series, just to see if they like it. Personally, I think this is a treat not to be missed!"
5,Sandman Fan,"I received my copy yesterday when I got home from work. It is better than I expected. I have two of the Sandman books (Preludes and Nocturnes & Dream Country) from the second edition, and wanted to own the rest of that edition. My problem had been that I could no longer find that edition, and I did not want the new edition. However, this hardback book is wonderful, even better than the second edition that I preferred the artwork in."
2,They recolored shoddy coloring with... computerized shoddy coloring,"I just heard about this book, and almost jumped for joy when I heard it was recolored. I always thought Sandman is so rich a mythology surely they could someday release a paint-over of the material as rich and artistically skilled as the material is imaginatively written. Well, this isn't it. The ""recoloring"" is just a bunch of Photoshop gradient color fills, and at that the job seems very amateur. If you're going to use gradients, AT LEAST know how to use them to create depth and roundness and shadows... this is just straight drops of color change... very boring. I know this won't bother everyone, people have different takes on art. For me it's a dealbreaker and I'll stick to the old versions which are cheap and have bad coloring rather than spending more money on new bad coloring."
2,Dream on......,"I have heard so many good things about this series and I never read it so when this edition came out I gave it a shot and I wish I could say I was floored by the work and had never read anything better but it just didn't click with me and I fail to see the praise that others have given this work. I have read a few other of Gaiman's works and have found them lacking as well. I don't want to bash the author or any of his other works but he is not my cup of tea. As far as his works in comics go the only book he has worked on that I have felt compelled to reread is the DC book ""Legends of the Green Flame."""
5,Perfect. Just perfect.,Perfect service and quality of the product. I plan on buying the next volumes of the absolute series. I highly recommend it.
5,Incomparable,"Initially bought this for my girlfriend, but ended up reading it after she did. All I can say is this: There's nothing quite like the Sandman series. It's incredibly entertaining - I've now officially become a Neil Gaiman fan."
2,Glued binding for $75 Rip-off.,"The comic is amazing. The art, writing, everything about Sandman is top-shelf. This version is enlarged, re-mastered (so to speak), and the paper quality is great. That being said, they charge you $75 for a product with a glued, not sewn binding. What this means is that if you read it carefully, once, the pages might stay together. If you read it twice, or open it too far more than once or twice, the pages WILL begin to fall apart. This is BS. Unless you don't ever plan on re-reading this, DO NOT BUY."
1,I hate this disc,"The performances are replete with odd quirks of execution -- phrases clipped or rushed, momentary hesitations all over the place. No doubt, the organist imagines this to be expressive. But, in the Six Fugues on BACH in particular, this is destructive to the music's intent. This is noble music, beautifully crafted. It should be performed with a keen sense of purpose and direction, with none of this spur-of-the-moment-like caprice."
4,"Not perfect, but quite likeable","Not ground-breaking by any means, but did have some unusual photos, i.e. the Nevada after being A-bombed, battlecruiser casualties at Jutland, etc. A good survey or gift for a budding battleship nut."
4,This is a great book for all naval enthusiasts,"The minute you open the book, the pages come alive with illustrations, text, and statistics for many ships. Many navies are represented, including Austria-Hungary, France, Germany, Russia, Italy, Great Britan, Japan, and the United States. You are told the strengths and weaknesses for most ships, and, more importantly, what their fate was in battle, or in peace time. It gives detailed descriptions of almost all aspects of the ship, and how these aspects influenced the ship's performance in battle. I recommend this book for those interested in naval history, ships, and military history."
4,Everyone needs a Muse,"Everyone needs a muse and Danzig discovers his own in Israeli born Meraw, the beautiful model for his course.This delicate creature had moved to California to escape the horrors of the Middle East but she works on staying strong to develop her own course.As the book evolves you discover the past worlds that are brought forward by the rich characters. A beautiful told book that will seduce you into a mystical world."
1,Why would anyone rate this wonderful book anything but 5 stars?,"How could someone be so crass as to rate this book one star?For the answer, let's look at some excerpts from the ALA review:~Holocaust and its aftermath...~haunting portrait of individuals tormented by their past.~children of a Nazi official~an Israeli soldier and granddaughter of a Holocaust survivor--~postwar Germany~psychic wounds.~creativity unfulfilled~childhood horror~his sister's suicide~transcendental reticence~touches his soul~tortured anxiety.~a restrained yet elegiacal voice~Rosner explores the power of memory and the providence of art to amplify and alleviate human suffering.If, after reading that you want to dive in then, by all means, enjoy.I'd rather save ten bucks and just wear my hair shirt for a week."
5,"New unreleased Eddie Hazel cd ""Home"" is available",Go to the official Eddie Hazel page here to order a copyhttp://www.myspace.com/eddiehazelThis album will be available on cdbaby.com soon as well!
1,DO NOT BUY,Do Not Waste your money buying this from Amazon. They will not send you the handbook instead they will send you the text book. And you will loose your dollars. They cheated me. So I want you to be aware.
4,Before its Time,"If this album had come out in 2001-2002 it would have been a big hit, too bad it came out in 1997. Very Jimmy Eat World, emo-punk sounding."
1,It's (very) boring and lacks serious analysis,"This book is very hard to read because of its dullness.As I read it, I was thinking that the book read as if written by an undergraduate: A compilation of a bunch of facts from many sources (usually without a reference) and with some remarks that lack any analysis (like blaming on neo-liberal policies the increase in Smog in the city of Santiago (!)) -if only we had followed the soviet union, we would have clean air-.This doesn't look like the work of a scholar (or of someone with a talent for writing for that matter), but rather of a couple of foreigners with an interest in Chile who said, ""hey, we could write a book about this country"".The real problem with the book is not its bias (or lack of it) but rather that it is just very hard to get oneself to read through it because it lacks insights, parallels with other situations in the world, witty remarks, etc. (i.e. what makes good books good).It reminded me of why I hated history in high school."
4,Essential Wishbone Ash...,"Any fan knows that it was the earlier releases that still hold up today. While not as balls out as the debut, there are some 'softer sides' of the band presented here: tracks 4-6 are wonderfully crafted. 'The Pilgrim' is a killer track, 'Vas Dis' is a strange one, 'Jail Bait' is typical of a track with this title. The live track(7) shows off the bluesier side of the band. I have always wondered what happened to the rest of the concert that this live track was culled from? I haven't heard this import version since the price is a bit rich for my tastes. MCA USA should be ashamed for not following the lead of MCA Japan and releasing these discs stateside. I have no idea if this title or any of the Japan titles have been remastered/repackaged/etc. But for the price, let's certainly hope so. Still a good album to own and to treasure."
4,Wishbone Ash still going!,"Just saw Wishbone Ash again for the first time since 1974 in Houston,TX.One word.GREAT!!If you get a chance to see them don't pass it up.Andy Powell is still with them and sounding better than ever.I understand that he has been voted as one of the top 20 guitarist of all time by Rolling Stone Mag.He deserves it!Such a underrated and underrecognized band."
5,Great package and sound,"I have been waiting to see reviews of these mini LP replicas, but took a chance and paid the big bucks. The sound quality of this old recording is superb. I wish all the old albums I have been replacing gradually to CD sounded this good. This review is not about the album (which is classic WA and essential if you like this band) but just about the sound quality. I will now be adding a few more of these Japanese versions that I never had on CD, BUT THEY ARE VERY EXPENSIVE! Some of the recent 24-bit re-mastered CD's must surely have the vinyl audio nuts taking notice! This album is a huge improvement over the original LP and CD."
2,Terrible audio-Good band,"The audio quality of this recording is among THE worst I have ever heard. I bought this disc recently because I had good times listening to it in the early 70s. It sounds like it was recorded and mixed on the old Auratones and nothing else. A complete lack of any low end on the entire mix; but the drums suffer the most.I did/do enjoy the disc because this was a pretty good band but, the quality really really sucks. Shame on whoever is responsible for it !!"
3,Intelligently Presented Portrait of Jesus the Teacher,"As a teacher, I rarely come across summer reading as interesting and theologically provocative as Dr. Cox's image of Jesus the rabbi. He begins where he finds his students, with a vast array of relgious backgrounds. He is not deterred by the skeptics, but relentlessly develops an identity of Jesus among his students. He has cultivated a wonderful course and brings the historical Jesus to bear on today's current moral issues. I only wish I could take the course!"
5,Good perspective on the Bible and Jesus' teachings,This book gives new insights into the scriptures and a fresh perspective. There is good food for thought in understanding the New Testament. Makes you think.
1,You hade to be there,"I actually liked this campy off-broadway show. Come on, it was meant to be fun, and three cheers for Nikki Snelson - ""I'm In Love With a Terrorist""!However, when it comes to any soundtrack CD, I measure it on what you can get from just listening to it. This soundtrack is totally meaningless without the on stage antics."
1,How To Save 15 Bucks and Find Something Better To Do for 90 Minutes,"Did the first reviewer see the same play I saw? Impossible. The only reason I stayed to the end was because I paid for the ticket (half price) and it's a sin to waste money. Though its premise sounded appealing at first, I ended up being spectacularly unimpressed with both the story and the music. I squirmed in embarrassment for the composer and librettist, as this material was obviously supposed to be fresh and irreverent but instead was simply weak and painfully unfunny. I hope Mr Karp and Mr Weinstein have day jobs, because musical comedy is definitely not their calling."
1,The Bomb on the Cover is Apt.,"Do not be fooled by any shill reviews, this show was a disaster in its commercial off-Broadway run last fall. As a matter of fact, they were so desperate for audiences that they told people how to get half-price tickets in the famous New York times ABC ads; absolutely unheard of! The score is a mish-mash of derivative music aiming to be satirical and lyrics that (as one critic noted) ""have a distressingly casual sense of rhyme."" Having suffered through this show (luckily on a free ticket) the only saving grace of this recording is that one will be blessedly free of most of the book, quite possibly the stupidest seen in a ""professional"" musical in a generation; yet even with being blessedly ignorant of the story's shortcomings the score to this is all but unlistenable. Look up Variety's pan of this show online and you will see it actually contains the phrase ""bring barf bags."" Buyer beware."
4,Good book for users who have never used or seen MS Project,"So far, this is the only book out in the market today that does a really good job of illustrating step-by-step how to use this software package.It also comes with a CD-ROM disk that contains templates and Microsoft Project utilities."
3,Heavy like it says.,"This machete is functional but there are a few drawbacks. For one the handle is massive. I am 6'2"" and have big hands and I feel like the plastic grip on this thing is just at the edge of my ability to comfortably hold. Forget using this if you are not a large man. Women and small men need not apply unless you have disproportionately large hands. You will have trouble gripping securely.The other thing is that it comes pretty poorly sharpened. I needed to hone the blade right out of the box. After an hour of hacking at blackberry vines it needs to be properly sharpened with a stone. Seems like they could have taken 5 more minutes to put a nicer edge on it.On the bright side it's pretty much an axe crossed with a machete so you can go through big branches just as well as underbrush."
4,Not too bad,"Good blade, I just wish it came with a sheth. The handle was sturdy and the quallity seems good so far. I have no regret buying it."
2,"Cool Looking, but Sucky Handle","One of the other reviewers is right: the handle on this blade is too damn big to hold onto. I'm a fairly large guy with descent sized hands, and this tool has flown out of my hand several times while cutting brush. And it's a shame, because this baby sure looks cool! It's just the size of the massive handle that makes it hard to work with."
2,Dodging Tumbleweeds?,"The next tumbleweed you see in East Texas will be the first. The East Texas that Elvis and company traversed in the 1950's was (and mostly still is) marked by piny woods and red dirt roads - not too dissimilar from the rural areas of Louisiana, Tennessee and other southern states where Elvis kicked off his career.The fact that the book description references tumbleweeds and rattlesnakes sends up a red flag for camp journalism.Having said that, if you ever do make it far enough into West Texas, New Mexico or Arizona to actually see tumbleweeds, don't bother swerving your vehicle to dodge them; they're pretty harmless."
3,Photos are great! Text gets in the way.,"Scotty Moore, Elvis' original guitar player and manager, told me he thought he had already seen every photo from that era until he saw this book. That's why I bought it. The snapshots in this book are great, but the writing is so full of itself, it's frustrating to read. I find the photos helpful as a visual reference when reading other books on Elvis' early years."
4,unusual choral cd,"This is a cd of unusual, less heard choral works. This is a very good performance of these works."
1,Dancing is good - movie is not,"The dancing in this movie is fun to watch. However, as a movie, the storytelling is incoherent, the plot is trite, and the characters are flat. There were multiple points during the movie where the it seemed to skip forward or backward in time without any kind of reference point, leaving me as a viewer lost and confused. If you're not a huge fan of dancing, skip this movie."
5,Great Pitot,This is a better product than what I first bought. It is a lot stronger and better suited for my needs. I am using on a 25' cabin cruiser
3,"Good, but not Lovesey's best","I was thoroughly confused during much of this book. Although everything comes together and makes sense at the end, the ebb and flow of this story seems a little too contrived for me to give it a higher rating."
5,Great action WTC DVD.,This video has incredible footage that i had never seen before. The action and the video showing destruction surpasses any other WTC video I have ever seen. I highly recommend this video
5,WTC 9/11/01 Day of Disaster,"There is no doubt that the attack on the World Trade Center was one of the most photographed events in history. Few photographers have been able to capture the action and events of that day from a firefighter's perspective. Steve Spak has accomplished this. Arriving minutes after the second tower collapsed, Steve shadowed operating firefighters and emergency personnel and documented firefighting and rescue operations immediately following the collapses. This is powerful, close-up footage that few people, other than those at the scene, experienced. Steve has recorded history and trhe events of that terrible day."
2,What hath Weis and Hickman wrought?,"Part of me wishes I'd never read this book and had remained in blissful ignorance instead. Like the rest of these authors' work, the writing and characters are absolutely fantastic. The plot, however, goes an awful downward spiral which literally destroys everything the other books stood for. The ending was a clever way to connect Krynn to Earth, but it was unnecessary. It may take several doses of the original trilogy to forget about this book upon reading it."
2,A dissapointing return to Krynn,"""Dragons of Summer Flame,"" returns us to the magical land of Krynn where many of us first fell in love with the fantasy genre. Unfortunately that return was an unpleasant and very unispiring reunion. The characters we once loved do absolutely nothing to motivate us, while their offspring never come to life. The convoluted plot seems slowed by the doggmatic adherence to formula. Regardless, it was a book worth reading, yet it doesn't beg one to miss any sleep. Perhaps its just that I've come to expect more from Margaret & Tracy."
3,"Could have been better, but still exciting none the less","I did not like the way this book ended, the interaction withthe Gods with the characters and the magic is the reason I fell in love with the Dragonlance series of books to begin with. But all in all the book was well written and loaded with plenty of action and suspence. If you enjoy Dragonlance the book is a must, but be ready for some disappointment."
3,Overall it was great but the ending was a disapointment.,"The book Dragons of Summer Flame was a good book. It follows the adventure Palin,Raistlins nephew, takes. Little do the characters know but they are destined to save the world from chaos. I liked the book because the story was exciting and kept my attention. Up until the end it was a great book. In the end the writer destroys what took many novels to create. Dragons of Summer Flame was a great book and worth reading."
4,Good Book,"""Dragons of Summer Flame is a good book. Written by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, both wonderful authors, this book is sure to be a good bet for you avid readers. ""Dragons of Summer Flame"" is the story of how the new generation of heroes must save their world known as Krynn from the evil father god known as Chaos. The hero Palin, a white mage, get's help from many unlikely people including the Dark Knight, Steel Brightblade, the rambunkchous kender, Tasslehoff Burrfoot, and a mysterious girl whose name I cannot place at this moment. Together they alone will decide the fate of an entire world. All-in-all, this book is an exciting read and I would recommend it to anyone."
3,M. Weiss and T. Hickman should be Ashamed!!!,I have no idea why they decided to ruin dragonlance in the fashion they did. The book although rather large was written as if the authors just wanted to speed through and put and end to Dragonlance. 50% of the book was pent reflecting on the other books they have written. They even were so bold as to hype 'DEATHGATE' (another set of books they wrote) in the story. Thanks alot you jerks! You just ruin everything you created.
2,Not even close to the original triology,This book is a disappointment to anyone after reading the three original Chronicles. The characters are pretty good but the story is horrible. I suggest to anyone who has read the Chronicles to read the Legends which are maybe even better then the Chronicles. But don't read this book it will taint the greatness of the other two triologys. All in all this book sucks because their are far fetched elements in the plot that are just dumb. I mean the creator of the Gods is freed and is pissed off against the world of Krynn. This book was written to make money and it shows.
1,Nooooo!!!!,"Does this mean there will be no more Dragonlance books.Someone please, please tell me there'll be more.They can create new Krynn novels on this new world (but itwouldn't be the same without tasslehoff)I'll probably give this a higher rating if I knowthis isn't DL's last book."
3,Not as good as the rest of the Chronicles,"For the amount of material covered, this book should have been its own trilogy. It seemed like Weis and Hickman rushed through the story to make it fit in one book. Case in point, the death of Tanis Half-Elven, perhaps the most influential character in all of Dragonlance. This story doesn't belong in the Chronicles anyway. It has almost no relation to the first three. There simply seems to be too much missing to merit anything more than three stars. By the way, why don't we ever meet Gilthas?"
4,It was OK,I think that the other chronicles were better than this one but it still had its good points.It was nice to see everyone back again. I especially liked it when Tas proved that small people can't only do small things.
3,A really great book with one huge problem,"I liked this book a lot. My issue isn't with the depressing ending; the reason I love the original books is that they make me cry a lot. This book is well-written, and it took a lot of cojones for the authors to take a wrecking ball to the world that they created and loved.I thought the whole Raistlin thing was finished. That's what the second trilogy was all about. As apparently the only person on earth who doesn't think the whole ""evil mean magic man"" thing is cool, I object to his having such a large role in the story. I feel like the authors brought Raistlin back just because he's popular with the fans, and that compromises the entire book for me.Well, even though I hate him, and therefore didn't appreciate the book, most people LOVE Raistlin, so, if you like him, go ahead and get the book, you'll love it. He was the only problem in the book"
3,At Last! A Good Book!,"At long last there's a good book out there. I always end up reading a book with a happy ending. Still, it was sad, but it was worth it!"
4,Good book but weak character development,"Right off the bat, the plot is pretty obvious. The Irda have the Greygem and the newly founded Knights of Takhisis are ready to take over the world. With some insane idea of protecting themselves with a power even the gods couldn't control, they crack the Greygem and let Chaos free. The heroes who are supposed to eventually beat back Chaos are running around fighting and ransoming each other. About midway through the book, the characters just start to reveal themselves and team up. At the end it seemed that Weis and Hickman tried to cram an entire book worth of getting to know the characters into a few chapters. I liked what they decided to do with Krynn, though. A series can only go on for so long before the history lessons of the world get boring and new scenery is needed."
1,Miserable book that shouldn't have been written,Why did they write this book? My theory is that there was some contractual obligation here so Weis and Hickman thrashed Dragonlance. How this book got published is beyond me. TSR must have wanted that cash bad. This book is the worst example of authors tearing down a house because they don't like living there anymore. How much more milk can they try to squueze out of Raistlin? STAY AWAY!!!! This is the Highlander 2 of novels.
2,I WISH I NEVER READ THIS CURSED BOOK,"I read this book in 3 days. I couldn't put it down. it was entertaining, but after i finished it, and layed it down, mith misty eyes i wished that i had never read it. It destroys everything and everyone that you ever loved about Krynn. There are so many things wrong with it too, in that i mean, things like the greatest of all gods not noticing some people just because they were hiding in a bush????? There are good parts to this novel and some things that i think you really should know happened (if you are as die-hard a fan as me), but i wish i could just tell you those things and not tell you the rest so that you would still have an unwavering optimistic view of the once magical world of krynn."
1,"Frankly, the worst book ever written","I had loved Weis and Hickman's Dragonlance stories and had been impressed by the depth of character development and plot. This book, however is incomprehensible to me as the writing style, characters and plots are but a mere shadow of previous publications. It seemed the authors had tired of the series and wanted to wash their hands of it in a sloppy way. If they had not been who they were, this would never have gotten past the high-school student interning at the publisher's office.Keep the beauty of their other publications pristine. Don't ever read this book."
1,I have to give it 1 star???,"This book has nothing that made Chronicles the excellent series it was. Characters are dull and lifeless, plot is juvenille, and the writing style is amateurish. I don't know how Weis & Hickman could have wanted their name on it. It looks like a book written by two angry authors. I hear they're writing another series. Why? Did they miss destroying something?"
1,Out On My Ear,"I enjoyed reading most of this book. I burned through it in three or four days, and I'm not a very fast reader. The deaths of major characters were actually a plus for me. I thought they died heroically well, and each instance added to the drama. The central character tensions involving Steel and Palin hold up as well, or better, as that which we've read before involving all the old favorites.It took a very demoralizing ending to pull my rating down as low as it is. ""The Age of Mortals"" does the trick. My experience of reading this book was like being at a nice party with old and new friends; and then, at the end of the night, getting punched in the gut, kicked out of the house, and told to ""never come back!!"". The authors might just as well have added a postscript saying ""Dear fantasy junkies, The fun is over. Go get a life.""I am a believer that all good things come to an end. But, in my opinion, reducing Krynn to Mundania was a poor way to go about it."
1,This book brought me to tears but for all the wrong reasons.,Why or why did they have to destroy what so many of us hold so dear? Dragonlance and the world of Krynn meant more to me than a story. It influenced my life and helped me grow as a person. I was so captivated and enthralled by the mystical world full of legendary dragons and other mythical creatures. I can't help but detest all those responsible for taking this away from me.
5,Summer Flame Review,"Exelent book, very good. A must buy for dragon lance fans. First read the Soulforge, Dragons of Autem Twilight, Dragons of Winter Night, and Dragons of Spring Dawning to better understand the book."
1,Weak @ZZ and disappointing,"This book completely destroys Dragonlance. I almost vomitted when I finished it. The two best writers Dragonlance has ever had threw together a piece of $hit. At the end almost everyone is dead, the Gods are banished (really ticked me off) and most importantly, magic is no more. I never though Dragonlance could produce a horrible book, but once again other people have proven me wrong. Hickman and Weis, you disgust me. I only picked one start because it would not allow me to rate any lower."
2,disappointing end to a great series,"(spoiler review)The overall sense I got about this book is that the authors were pressured to put out another volume in the series. Their response? To virtually kill off the world of Ansalon as their readers know it. Sure, it survived, but it's not the same world it was -- all the gods are gone. Killing Tanis and Tas might have seemed like the final nail in the coffin, but I could have dealt with that had they provided better characters to take their places. However, the only truly complex character (Steel) dies in the final battle, leaving us with Palin (who somehow isn't terribly believable) and the fairly one-dimensional Usha. Very disappointing. All good things must come to an end; I just wish this had been a better one."
4,Finally something different....,I applaud the authors for writing a book where everything DOESN'T end happy for everyone. A touch of reality mixed in with fantasy is a breath of fresh air. Well done.
2,Suprisingly a disappointment,I was disappointed in the conclusion of this book. Many of the companions that we have come to know and love meet an unfitting fate. Heros are killed off uselessly and dishonored. I loved the trilogy. It is the best 3 books I have ever read but this one is very poorly written. It appears as if the authors were rushed to finish this book. I did not like the finale to the heros of Krynn.
2,"Petty grudge, maybe?","We all knew the authors were mad at TSR, and TSR needed a bridge to go into their Fifth Age DL material, thus we get Dragons of Summer Flame: A novel that manages to kill (or at least maim) all the characters that the reader might actually care about. (and even here they only care because of previous works) Palin is boring, Raistlin is interesting, but he's disabled and just wastes away. And killing off Tas in that redicious manner...revolting. In summation, this book can't stand on its own and seems to be little more than a way to lead dragonlance readers into the ""Fifth Age"" by ruining magic. Sad, and not recommended."
5,"Excellent beginning and middle, bumber of an end.","This is an excellent book. You gotta lovethose cliff hangers at the end of each of thechapters. I couldn't put the blasted book downI start reading it at nine at night intendingon only reading one or two chapters and oftentimes find that it's three or four in themorning and I'm still reading it!I almost broke out in tears when I got to thelast few pages though. Besides my favoritekender Tas being killed off, all the godsleft,and most importantly all the magic ofKrynn was also gone. Talk about an awefulfate! I really hope this doesn't mean theend the Dragonlance series, that would be afate worse than death.Nevertheless this is an excellent book and Idefinitly recommend reading it."
2,UM NOT TO GREAT,The book itself is somewhat interestingbut the fact that they kill off almost every main characterincludeing the new ones kinda makes it seem like weisand hickman are sick of there only being know for dragonlanceand decided to do away with it
1,...this book should never have been born.,"I am a huge fan of the series, but this book was terriblebeyond words. Like some old retired [xxx] actor, Weis and Hickman comeout to perform a final filthy act strictly for the money. Outside this book, the series was great."
1,Changing the entire Dragonlance universe?,"To me, this book seemed to negate the entire structure of the Dragonlance realm. Without giving too much away, they kill off most of the remaining Heroes of the Lance, dispel the gods, and dispose of entire class - the magic user. Lord Soth makes an appearance as well (but he was trapped in the Ravenloft world forever a few years ago - he must have found a way out). The do delve into the next generation of Heroes (Palin and Steel) but at what price - the total restructuring of the entire Dragonlance world? Too bad that books aren't like cars, this one needs a recall. I beleive that this book suffered the same fate as many succesful series. Did anyone see Jaws 4, where the shark went to the Bahamas and was killing people because it was ""personal""? This book is sort of like that. Crank out too many sequels and you are going to have a dud. This one is it."
2,True Dragonlance Fans Beware,"I am a true lover of the two Dragonlace Trilogies, Chronicles and Legends, and must say that Dragons of Summer Flame was a disappointment.Character development was severely lacking in this book and the integration of our beloved companions and the next generation of heroes does not harmonize. Perhaps the worst part of this book is how frivilous the lives of people are. those whom we've come to endear are slain without much thought. The valor or purpose seen in Sturm's death is absent in Summer Flame.I was hoping for a lot more in Summer Flame. And although it is a decent book, it does not live up to the standard that Weis and Hickman set in their original two Trilogies. this book should have been told in a trilogy itself, taking time to fully develop characters and such, but instead, we are given a very shallow view."
2,The King is dead - not long live the King,"This is the book that really began Dragonlance's downfall... It's as if the authors or whoever decided to make the book wanted to revitalize Dragonlance, and instead ended up ruining most of what made Dragonlance fun. Still, I'd have liked to give it 2.5 stars, but since I couldn't, I erred on the side of condamnation since the book was such a disappointment. After DoSF came the horrible Fifth Age. *shudder* Well, I've moved to Forgotten Realms, so Wizards is still getting my money.Despite the failings of the story, Weis and Hickman were up to their usual standards of writing, meaning DoSF was still more enjoyable than nearly all the Dragonlance spinoffs.Speaking of the spinoffs, there was one phrase in the book said by Astinus, ""but this is another tale"" when speaking of Crysania or something similar. If that wasn't a hook for a spinoff, I don't know what was. Sure enough, in time Tears of the Night Sky was published."
4,"Good, but not like the ather seris.",I liked Gdil because he is olmost the oldest figher in this book and i liked him in the over books of this seris. I also liked that the evil Knights have a lot of dignety like the good Knights.
5,excelsior !!! so neat,"I have read almost all of the dragonlance book, i said almost, esp. the works of tracy & hickman they are my favorite, keep up the work and never never destroy the world of kyrnn.. thanxs a lot guys"
1,THIS BOOK WAS HORRIBLE,If you want to waste 19 bucks as well as spend hours seeing characters that you've loved or hated for years being destroyed(i.e. all the heroes in Dragonlance) then by all means read this book!
2,10 Disappointing things about this book,"1) All of the gods and goddesses that used to be so cool before, become weak and even seem mortal. 2) Palin's brothers, who everyone was looking forward to see, were killed even before they did anything. 3) Tanis Half-Elven dies a unheroic death. (Unlike Sturm) 4) Introducing the Irda was a mistake. 5) Having Raistlin's daughter turn out not to be her daughter was pretty weak. 6) Raistlin without magic is like Dirty Harry with no guns. 7) Death Knights weren't as awesome as they were supposed to be. 8) The other books were good, why did this hafta suck?? 9) Palin is not Raistlin. (and is boring) 10) Chaos didn't really do much..."
4,And the fire dies.....,"Dragons of Summer Flame, while a good piece of Fantasy, was a bit of a disappointment to this long time Dragonlance fan. While I won't spoil the end for you, lets just say that Krynn will never be the same again. It was my impression that the authors had just grown tired of Krynn the way it was and decided to make a drastic change. And while indeed that is their porogative, it kind of kills any future Dragonlance novels for me. I give it a 7 because it is indeed a very good piece of Fantasy, but the flame on Krynn has died, and unless the authors can once again work the magic of the Gods, I no longer have a spark of interest in any future Dragonlance novels."
3,I am boycotting this book,"Its a great story, but Weis and hickman kill any character off that the reader may have liked, and they throw magic out of Kyrnn! All my friends and I deny that this book relates to any book in this series, its just a completely seperate tragic story."
1,"Great at building, bad at deconstructing","Weis and Hickman are two of the best world builders out there. Chronicles was amazing. Lengends was even more amazing. This book was horrible. Nothing leaves a worst taste in your mouth when you read a book by authors who don't seem to care about what they are writing. What a hokey way to show that Palin was the ""greatest wizard of all time"". <bleach> The reformation of Krynn, to me, sounds like at least a 3 book series. This book seemed very rushed, and had a weaker ending than even the DeathGate series, another group of books with the most amazing world-building I've read yet, and a most amazing let-down."
2,In Which Weis and Hickman go on a rampage.,"I honestly think Weis and Hickman were so peeved at being buffaloed into doing another book by T$R that they decided to go on a killing spree of the main characters, which fit well into T$R's plans for Fifth Age (There's no gods! No magic! But look at that handling!). Tanis' death was tolerable, since he went out in a noble way, the writing style is as descriptive as ever, and it's always good to see Raistlin, but Chaos is a lame bad guy (He needs to summon armies of goofy creatures? Ao of Toril could snap his fingers and fry the Realms!), Caramon's kids are dumb, and all the Irda -an interesting race- get roasted. I dunno. Its greatest fault is making you think, ""You mean all those damn Dragonlance novels I read were pointless?""Oh, and I don't care what Weis and Hickman say. Usha IS Raistlin's daughter; they made that clear in Tales. Or was that more meaningless crap like Summer Flame? Oh well, back to the Realms..."
3,Dragonlance Review,"The book is awsome, however it is not what I was looking for. I was looking for the graphic novel that looks like a comic book."
2,An endless disappointment to a proper Dragonlance fan,"The book is quite well written, and is sure to provide good entertainmentfor any non DL fan. Having read most of the DL novels,I feel qualified tosay that this novel is not written in the DL spirit. It seems obvious thatthe book has been written on request, rather than on inspiration. In mostof the book they do everything to please the DL fan, like reviving Raistlin,and giving most of the old heroes an appearance. But in the end the authorskill the DL saga, probably to please TSR, so that the company can createanother roleplaying game."
4,"A great story, but not quite the Dragonlance style.","This conclusion to the Dragonlance saga is ok. In and of itselfI found this to be an entertaining, if not captivating story.But, it doesn't quite round out the saga of Dragonlance, at leastnot with respect to the first three Chronicles. I found there tobe too much focus on the second generation. I would've liked to haveseen more nostalgic encounters with old characters. But perhaps I am looking at itall wrong. As the first Dragonlance book I'd read in 6-7 years, I wassurprised that it did whet my appetite enough to go back and reread thesix original Weis/Hickman books. All in all, a great story."
1,This is a REAL WINNER! Of the worst dragonlace book...ever!,"If you have ever read a dragonlance novel, then you know what to expect. I am a Weis & Hickman fan. I own 10 of their books, and this is the book that took a flop. It has no plot, and it is not relevant to the rest of their books. Except Palin Majere is introduced, who is Raistlin's nephew. That is ALL you need to know. I promise. But this is the most plot depressing book i have ever had the nerve to read. I gave the book away. If you are looking for a book that will let you down read this. If you are looking for a good epic fantasy series, read the Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn trilogy by Tad Williams. It is Better than Tolkien,....seriously.The main reason i would not recommend this to anyone is, compared to great stories like The Lord of the Rings and Memory Sorrow and Thorn, this book was written by a 9-year old neanderthal boy. This book has poor sentence structure, no mysteries, nothing exciting, and no plot!"
3,WHY????,I love dragonlance and suffered greatly thru this book. After the war of the lance the belief in the gods finally come back. Then the gods really do leave Krynn. This was a very good story but why fix something that wasn't broken. If you want to create a new world start a new series. Don't destroy perfection.
2,Out of place with chronicles,"I loved the chronicles, read all three books more than once in the space of 9 years..but I couldn't finish this one. Why? It seems this book was made to kill off everything on Krynn and start all over again, not what I and other Dragonlance fans wanted.What we wanted was an adventure that reunited all the living heroes, and with the spirit of Raistlin battle an evil and powerful foe from the Abyss..or something like that. I was shocked when Tanis was stabbed in the BACK!!! My favourite hero killed by an Orge for gods sake!!TSR YOU owe us fans an explanation, or a movie!"
4,"Excellent, but needed even more magic!","This book was one of the best of the Dragonlance series, second only to Dragons of Autumn Twilight, which set the scene and was, in my opinion, the best of the series. The only thing that would have made DoSF even better is more magic! I wanted to see Raistlin have an out-and-out with the entire Wizards Conclave. Of course he would have won."
3,FAILED!,"I really wanted to like this book. I grew up on the Dragonlance novel series Chronicles, and Legends. After many years and much hype, this book enters the world of Dragonlance. What a joke! This book is typical of this partnership of authors; Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. They basically start killing people off, and destroy the world. It feels like the authors just had one big brain fart and wrote to fill some word quota versus to entertain the reader. I sat there forcing my eyes across the page hoping that the book would reveal some kind of saving grace. No luck. Read this book to satisfy your curiosity, but do not waste your money."
2,nowhere near as good as the first three,"I read the first three books in this series in no time at all, I could not put those books down. this one is slow and quite boring really...I have had it for probably 6 months and still am only a hundred pages if even that into it..."
4,A little disappointing...,"Unlike everyone else, I wasn't disappointed in the ending(even though I knew that was a bad idea). It was the way the story was written that disappointed me.This was a story that should have been told in 3 novels. After learning in the Second Generation that evil had discovered the secret to defeating good(by having respect for one's opponents), I wanted to see evil win for about 2 books. I wanted to see good struggle with an opponent that couldn't be beat by inner ambition. Dang you, Chaos!It was also a little disappointing to learn that Usha wasn't Raistlin's daughter. After I learned how awesome the bad guys had gotten, I immediately thought good was in real trouble & would need a miracle to win. Then I thought maybe the miracle would come in the form of Raistlin & his daughter but it was not to be. Anybody else think that would have made a great trilogy?"
4,"Great Story, but not so hot ending","The story is fascinating, but it really lacks in the battles that the dragonlance chronicles are used to be filled with. The part about Raistlin's nephew, Palin and his 'daughter'having a feelings for each other. The battle at the High Clerist Tower, when Tanis Half-elven died, was a little short, and the details of the battle was lacking. The best part was when Palin, Caramon's son and Steel Brightblade battled Chaos, the Father of everything and of nothing. It was very vivid and exciting. It could have been better. It doesn't do justice to the Dragonlance Chronicles and the Legends series."
4,Great book. Where can they go now though?,"I thought this was a great book, but I feel it should have been at least two books really. For me the magic of the first trilogy was discovering the Gods and the worrld with the charecters yet in this book the authors pretty much distroy it all.The main story was good, many people disagree with the death of some of the old characters but I think for the seris to move on they did not need to have things or people pulling them back to the last age. I do disagree with the way the death of Tanin and sturm was brushed over though.I really did enjoy the return of rastlin and his interaction with caramon. I do not see how Dalmar could fool any one into thinking she was raistlins child though becuase she had no magic at all not even the natural Irda magic.So all in all it was a good book but you have to ask where do the authors have to go now, the world is left God and magic less. The next novel will mack or break the dragon lance world."
3,Decent book. But.,"A good book that can stand by itself, but it is a huge waste to let the gods come back, and then make them go away.If I were one of the new believers, I'd want to hack up the clerics for giving me so much hope and excitement only to find out that, sorry, it's 4th age again, no more gods! No more magic! No more good authors carrying on the tale! Jean Rabe's comin'.Why have Tanis die? Why have two nearly unknown characters die? Why have Chaos(TSR) come in and ruin a perfectly good story?"
2,Pistol Grip Air Inflator,"I got this inflator so my wife could successfully inflate her tires. The clip-on attachment is better than the rigid style inflators, but still does not always seal satisfatorily against the tire's valve. The high pressure gauge does not provide accurate readings and requires the use of a separate gauge to make accurate tire pressure adjustments. Overall it is a worthwhile purchase. Four stars.Follow-up. The first time I dropped the inflator the gauge needle fell off rendering the item useless unless used with a separate pressure gauge. Two stars."
2,DIY,"The inflator works fairly well for automobile tires; however, I was unable to properly attach the device to fill bicycle tires. No matter how I attached the inflator, air escaped around the attachment."
5,Paul Simon boxed set,"Even though I have all of these cd's, I really like this boxed set-the sound is great, and the extras are great. This man has written music that resonates with me-the 60's throught the 90's(and hoping for a DVD from the ""Old Friends"" tour). It is worth getting this set just for the sound-I am listening to this music, and it sounds better than ever- It sounds fresh to me."
5,Dueling guitar magic!,"Incredible dueling guitar axework here. These guys invented the sound that would later give us Thin Lizzy, Iron Maiden and the like. In my opinion, this is Wishbone Ash's best album by far. Heavy in its own way but rocks nonetheless! I was blown away when I first heard it and still am today..."
2,Informative but extremely biased in tone,"This book gives you the basic overview of Sikh history. Unfortunately, at times the author seems more concerned with his opinion that no reasonable person could believe in any of this than he is with actually recording the facts. It's becoming a little too cliche to talk about a religion and to label its followers as blind to the realities of the world. This books seems more concerned with discounting Sikhism than exploring its dogma."
1,"Biased, unobjective, not worth your money","McLeod, a Christian Missionary, in another attack Sikhism seeks to provide a more of an anthropological work colored in bias that seeks to diminish the stature of the Sikh religion. He does not refer to the Sikh scripture for authority. Can you imagine a general book on Christianity without the mention of the Holy Bible? McLeod rather define the Sikhs according to his bigoted viewpoint of a missionary than refer to the Sikh scripture and historic Sikh tradition. Please save your money and instead buy a more balanced and definitive work, The Sikhs, by Patwant Singh, which is available in both paperback and hardcover editions. You will thoroughly enjoy the riveting style of Patwant Singh. McLeod is not worth your time and money."
1,Nothing Much,This book tells the original sikhs nothing and i wasted my $16 on this stupid book. I hope that this review will help to my fellow brothers and sisters to be aware of this book.Gur Fateh
3,"Weak, not truly representative of Justin","THis sort of proves that solo projects aren't always a good idea. Justin Hayward doesn't quite cut it here. His voice is spectacular, but 90% of the songs on here are just weak and awful. The most outstanding track is ""Nostradamus"" but even that is flawed. I am not disputing Justin as a great songwriter (think of his contrubutions to so many Moodies albums) but with this 1977 solo release, he seemed to take a different path and it was not a good one. I think it is only worth purchasing if you can buy it for a bargain. The bonus tracks are not spectacular either."
4,Justin Hayward has wonderful voice.,"I recommend this CD for Justin's fans and also all music lovers, especially ""Nostradamus"" and ""Songwriter Part Two"" are wonderful.Sibel"
4,just haywards 1st solo lp?...,"...good lp w/ 3 of 4 decent xtras. fave tracs r: 5, especially 6, 8, 9, 10-decent music styles of acoustic and elec. guitared tracs. ive known this lp for a while; moving mountains and night flight are the next good lps, in that order."
5,A Hidden Classic,"I originally bought this album on vinyl when it first came out while the Moodies were on hiatus. Personally I loved it, but my friends at the time were very lukewarm to it. Then I heard the track ""Nostrodamus"" used during an intermission at the Vancouver Planetarium. Ecclectic? Sure. Awesome? Absolutely!"
1,Terrible,"Like all of the Moodies' solo releases (except Blue Jays by Justin Hayward and John Lodge - so not really solo which is fabulous) and all of their releases after Seventh Sojourn, this one really stinks! Avoid!!"
4,"If you are a ""core 7"" Moodies fan, you will like this,","I bought this LP in the 70's and enjoyed it then. Believe it or not, it sounds even better now. The power of remastering."
4,Justin Time,"Overly produced, lyrics that borderline sappiness, and sentiments that could push a diabetic into a coma...And I like it. Justin Hayward has a unique voice and a unique and underestimated guitar talent. I know a lot of his songs are the moral equivalent of a ""Chic Flick"", but I don't care. I've always liked his style and Songwriter has some very good moments on it."
5,Excellent Jig Kit,"The Wolfcraft 4643 Pocket Hole Jig Kit is an excellent tool for the occasional use of pocket hole joinery. For frequent or professional use, the KREG family of accessories may be easier to use, but for the DIY'er the Wolfcraft kit is useful and economical.I had occasion to use my kit in fabricating a new garage door inside handle when the original plastic one broke. The kit worked fine to secure the two sections of the cruciform together."
1,Go see a therapist,Sharon Olds needs to stop writing poetry and instead she needs to go see a therapist; at least the therapist will get paid to hear her whine.
4,This is a beautiful compilation of some of Olds' best work.,"This book is filled with poetry for ""everywoman,"" and deals with issues such as romantic and sexual relationships, childbirth and childrearing, and physical and verbal abuse."
4,If you like Godflesh,The guy from Godflesh is the one who brought this band together. That should sum it up a bit. I did own this CD at one time and it was Friggin Great!
5,"Rock solid, grisly minimalist cinema!!!","I was really looking forward to seeing this film, especially since I was a big fan of Ti West's last film, THE ROOST. That film had a very withdrawn, simplistic approach to genre material and Ti takes that approach even further with this film. I can see why people wouldn't like this film. The first half hour is very slow, but it builds to a tremendous payoff! When the violence strikes, it's quite shocking. The location work was breathtaking, especially towards the end of the film when our hero wonders through an adandoned factory. The film does require patience, which will probably be met with a lot of disdain for today's A.D.D. cinema-aficionados, but if you're looking for a different kind of movie-watching experience, I whole-heartedly recommend this flick! I can't wait to see what Ti West comes up with next!"
3,I went with it,"Patient filmmaking, to say the least. As seems to be demonstrated by the array of reviews here, Trigger Man is not for everyone. But it worked for me ... The suspense was often painful, created by (yes) long stretches of silence without any dialogue ... but waiting for the horror to come (and it does come) and not knowing when or from where ... well it just had me squirming in my seat.No fast-paced Quantum of Silence/Bourne-style editing here, and impatient viewers who aren't interested in anything but in-your-face fast cuts and loud explosions probably won't even connect to the tension that's building here ... but if you're tuned into that sort of wavelength, you'll enjoy this gripping little walk through the woods."
3,has one of the best endings in the history of cinema,this film has one of the best endings in the history of cinema (who will believe me....i must be exaggerating-right?) but unfortunately what precedes it is entirely mediocre
1,not quite good on grease,"I purchased this product on the strong recommendation of Merrel shoes customer service. I have a chameleon 4 shoes which I wore once on a service call to one of the restaurant kitchen I service. Somehow my beautiful shoes top portion got in contact with some grease/oil which I tried thrice to clean with hot water and mild detergent,with degreaser, and baking soda. None of them worked. So I called Merrel, and they recommended Nikwax. It was with great anticipation waiting for the product, then finally using it, and waiting for a good result. Once it dried, the same old grease was still there.After I informed Merrel about the result, they graciously mailed a check for my purchase price of Nikwax. So, if you have grease or oil on your nubuck Merrel, Nikwax is not the product to go to."
4,Wonderfully informative!,"I really appreciate the brief biographies of the writers, which is a great insight and better understanding of their works. The footnotes are a bit excessive, however informative.I am reading this for school and all in all I am very impressed and it is making my class much easier!"
4,Very Nice,"I originally saw these torches in one of those 'upscale' (read high priced) catalogs but did not want to pay such a high price. Then I discovered these very same items in Amazon.com and at a much lower price. So the rule here is: Find what you like, but check Amazon because it will most likely be at a better price.The torches are of good quality and actually somewhat larger than what I expected, yet they look great. My only problem was that one pole attachment was broken in one set that I ordered. This was due to the fact that the manufacturer's packaging is more for retail stocking and not so robust for UPS shipping...."
3,Like it...don't love it.,"I'll begin by saying that the story is at least well-written. May does a good job of bringing the times and characters to life. I do wish his characterization of Poe had been more on the mark. From what I've read of him (which is a lot) he was not the foul-mouthed slob that May paints him as.The story ends rather ubruptly. Everything gets explained away in the few paragraphs that make up the last chapter. May really stretches some of the facts to create the story, and then clumsily tries to sew it all together at the very end.All in all, it was an okay read as a work of fiction."
3,DVD Ripoff,"While it is nice to hear the music witht the 5.1 the DVD is a ripoff. NO live concert, NO perfermance video. Just the cd 1 & 2 music with some cheesy graphics over the music. Save some money and get the cd version. The dvd is a waste."
5,The finest release of the warriors on the edge of time,"Space Ritual has all of the groups most important members. Mike Moorcock is there, Lemmy, Rob Calvert, Nik Turner, and of course Dave Brock. A psychedelic masterpiece, Space Ritual sets the blueprint for Skin Yard, Voivod, Soundgarden, and Notably Monster Magnet. The experiance is other worldly and stunning. A must for those discovering the band. This live album might be the best of all Hawkwind records."
5,Space Ritual; The Finest Hour de Hawkwind,"C'était les concerts qui étaient le point fort et le cheval de bataille du groupe depuis 1967. En 1973, Hawkwind lana un double LP Live intitulé Space Ritual. Cet album est devenu avec le recul ; le meilleur album du groupe et un album phare dans l'histoire du rock.La réédition remastered nous propose trois excellents bonus tracks tirés de deux de leur concert donnés à Londres en 1972.Cet album est une pièce incontournable d'anthologie du Space Rock."
4,Metal on the edge of space,"Got headphones?To many people 'space rock' means the monotone drone of new age, HW is anything but that. They combined the sounds of Lemmy & Motorhead with the free form sax of Nick Turner. Long before the name was they were playing speed metal with the psychedelia of Pink Floyd, Moody Blues, etc."
3,Great live set but it all blends together a little to easily,"3 1/2Expectedly satisfying in equal parts space and sludge, this live disc remains a sturdy time-capsuled recording but musically does not exceed expectations. It's all slightly amateurish and rather monotone in a garage-stoner sort of way, though arguably the best example of that, especially back then. It's great stuff to invest in when starting out in alternative classic heavy rock; people who argue Hawkwind's influence may as important as Sabbath's have every right to do so....many of the tunes just get a little old and repetitious over time."
5,No complaints seem to work,No complaints on this one.. seems to work as advertised... not sure how a product like this could do anything wrong unless it just kills all your fish.. which it doesn't! So I have to assume it works!
5,Great product,Have not lost any fish during aquarium cycle while using this product. I highly recommend and will not hesitate to use in the future.
5,Amazing,"I just bought Prime at a local store this afternoon and added it to my turtle's tank which had very high ammonia and nitrate levels. I tested the water about two hours after adding the ""emergency dose,"" maybe 4 cap fulls or so, and the amount of nitrates was HALF of what it was the day before. Ammonia levels were also lowered. I feel so much better about the health of my turtle and fish now!"
2,Doesn't work as described.,"Claims to remove ammonia. Ammonia is present in my tap, and that is why I chose this product over other water conditioners out there. You have to use this product at 10 times the dosage listed on the bottle in order to remove ammonia from your tap water. If you are buying this for ammonia, then I recommend looking into a different product. Seachem Stability is also a terrible product. I would avoid Seachem products altogether if I were you."
5,Cheap and more than I'll ever use,"The package was initially lost, Amazon re-sent the item with free 1-day shipping. Easy to use, fish are never stressed after adding new water."
1,Im sure it is a good product but...,Im sure it is a good product but... it is too high a concentration and it is a ton of stuff. I don't know if it works but I think it killed my snails.
5,Effective and safe,"Very effective, safe for fish and takes only a small amount to work. Buy graduated 5 mil syringe so you can more accurately treat the water when doing water changes since 5 ml can treat 50 gallons. Also make sure you use luke warm tap water so the temperature stays stable. I use an instant read waterproof thermometer, which is designed for using in the kitchen and a graduated 5 gallon bucket from H. D3p0+., check the paint section."
1,Terrible reproduction of a classic text,"Whoever ""General Books"" is, this company has done an absolutely horrendous job reproducing the text of Thomas Hodgkin's classic work on Theodoric the Ostrogoth. Most inexcusable is an apparent total lack of proofreading. There are every kind of typographical error imaginable present in this book - and most are repeated over and over again, as if whatever format was used did not translate properly when printing occurred. In some cases the errors are of such a nature as to make reading the text impossible. Sometimes one cannot even tell from the context what was intended.I am not only leaving a strong negative review here, but am also complaining to Amazon.com about the poor quality of this print job. Amazon should not be carrying books with text this atrocious.If you want to read Hodgkin, find his original work through your interlibrary loan service.DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!"
3,No miracle,Doesn't really eliminate dry heels... it just moisturizes temporarily; just like almost every other brand of skin cream. It's OK... but not a miracle.
5,best thing for dry heels,I have been using this product for about 2 years and it not only takes care of my dry heels but has reduced the size of my calluses so I don't have to go to the foot doctor as often to remove the calluses.
2,not a good fit for me,"It's not what i expected...........thought it would help to soften my rough heals, but it didn't do what i expected. would try another product."
1,"These guys are right, This Game ROTS!","Wow, Konami. That is about all I have to say,... wow... I rented this game at Blockbuster thinking It was gonna be like Dungeon Dice Monsters or a good card game kind of like The Sacred Cards, boy was I wrong. You basically move around the board in a square fashion, and try to summon mosters with a die, sadly it hardly ever seems to work. There is really not much to say except if you want a worthwhile Yu-Gi-Oh! game get The Sacred Cards, or WCT 2004 or 05 NOT this game!!!"
2,Good for only one reason,"I don't think the game is good at all. There is, however, a reason to get this game. It comes with DD Assailant, one of the most sought after cards in the game. But I honestly don't think that you should waste $20+ for 1 card."
1,this game sucks,"This game is soooooo bad. All you do is pick a character and go on a game board. You roll the die to try to summon a monster, but YOU NEVER CAN! Overall, this game is horrible and I do not recommend it for anyone."
1,Gimmick - Worst Yu-Gi-Oh game,We don't use cards. Instead we use a boring board game. It's too hard for it's own good and you can't save your progress in between the game. The voice acting is so bad it's funny. The graphics are horrible. The board game mechanics weren't even built right. And there is only one mode to play in.
4,Destiny Board Travelogue,"A very good game, with some great effects and character abilities. My own skill level adds to the challenges of the game, yet it is still an incredible game. I highly recommend this game for any and all Yu-Gi-Oh! enthusiasts. A definite must-have for all fans of the manga, television and game series. A great game to build a collection with/around."
2,"bad gameplay, bad graphics","Yeh, Yeh, the box didn't look promising and the game is rubbish too! Cute 'Polly Pocket' graphics, reminds me abit like Habbo, you choose a character and go out and play with funny little cards. Gameplay is stupid. Graphics are alrite and its just stupid with music identical to a GameBoy Colour game."
2,"Well, it's not a work of art...","How true. It's not the funnest game in the world, but it is worth a few moments of your time.I don't recommend it if your not a Yu-Gi-Oh fan.If you are a Yu-Gi-Oh fan, perhaps your familiar with the episode where we first meet Duke Devlin. They play a little game called Dungeon Dice Monsters.If you found that interesting, then definitely buy this game b/c it's pretty much a recreation of this."
3,"Mixed feelings, but some very insightful content","In general, I have mixed feelings toward this book. For example, I found a lot of the content to be unnecessarily repititious. However, the general thesis was good food for thought.In this volume, Romanyshyn looks at a our propensity as culture to look at life from a very monucular linear perspective. He borrows many analogies from art and this is helpful in understanding his ideas.Basically, this book deals with our alienation from our bodies, nature and what makes us basically human. He claims much of this evolved out of Cartesian dualism and ties it in to the development of perspective in painting and the rise of technology.I enjoyed many aspect of this book, but at times found the repitition and verbose language frustrating. However, the underlying premises and arguments seemed to hold. In short, I think this book needed more exacting editing. If this was the case, I would give it a much higher rated review."
4,Excellent history!,"I very much appreciated Bobrick's detailed account of the evolution of the English language bible. Its a tragedy more Americans don't understand the origin of THEIR bible. I beg to differ with Mr. Bobrick's conclusion that the English language bible is the basis for American traditions found in the Bill of Rights. I feel he over looks the fact that German Americans are the largest ethnic group in the country (if not a significant minority at the time of the revoluiton) and that the Reformation began as a grass roots rebellion in Germany. I would argue the basis of American institutions of freeedom have more to do with the traditions of German protestant settlers than the King James verion of the bible. Other wise, I find the book to be an excellent historical study."
4,more than just the story of the KJB,"I know that more recent books have been published on the same subject, but I'm not sure if they give quite as much history on the King James Bible. ""God's Secretaries"" came out recently, but I believe that is focused on the writing of the KJB itself, while ""Wide as the Waters"" goes back to give the history of the Greek and Latin translations and, most interestingly, Wycliffe's translations and the persecutions of his followers. Just a great retelling of an interesting story."
2,"Too much commentary, not enough sound history","The text fails to substantiate the thesis of the title (What revolution? The KJV was a translation meant to stop puritanical influences in the Church of England and gained acceptance only after the failure of the puritan revolution), relying quite a bit on the author's own opinions and prejudices. The author states that Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury Laud was trying to drag England back to Romanism(?!?) when he was actually just trying to enforce the use of the Book of Common Prayer and KJV of the Bible. This is bad history based off of poor scholarship. If you want to read a much better (less imaginative, more fact based) text on the Authorized Version of the 1611 Bible and its place in English Church history, read McGrath's ""In the Beginning."""
4,Wide as the waters,"I found this an interesting book. It presented a historical comment on the history of the bible and it use and misuse by various people.It (the bible) can be used as a foundation for required 'checks and balances' in churches and society. Sadly, in many circumstances, it is ignored in both.A good historical read and an insight into the determination and faith of those people who brought the bible to where it is today.Recommended"
4,learned a lot,This is a good history of how the Bible came to be translated into English. It covers the period from Wycliffe's Bible in the late 14th century to the King James Bible in the early 17th.It's well written and is an excellent source for those who don't know much about the subject.The last chapter sort of veered off topic by just talking about the English Civil War. I would have preferred if he had instead given us information about later translations of the Bible such as the New International Version. Also I would have liked to have more info on why the Apocrypha was eventually dropped from the canon despite being in the original King James Bible.
3,hell the worst,"Maybe the worst album from the best band of Germany. They have a strange style. This isn't a heavy metal band, but sometimes they do the best heavy metal. They isn't progressive, but some songs are more technical than bands like yes. This album is the worst, but maybe you'll find it isn't."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!!!,"I have to tell you this is nothing but an extension of the tabloids/""rags"". They have just decided to elaborate on the Enquirer's stories. My guess is that Sophia and Lisa were just looking to make money!! I want my money back!!"
2,Unfinished book,"I don't know why the publisher let this book be released. The authors quote some people who are mad at Phil McGraw, and admit that they could not find additional proof of the complaints people express. The authors repeat themselves is ways that expose that they did not have enough material for a whole book. The point of this book is that Dr. Phil is an aggressive bully, and the authors could have developed that point in about five pages of text. This book does a big disservice to the reputation of this publisher. I will definately research at length any book I consider buying from this publisher in the future."
4,"Sorry to ruin your day, but Dr. Phil is a Slimeball; just check the public record","This book was conducted by real award winning journalists if anyone would bother doing any research on the making of this book, not some tabloid reporters. None of the negative stories are refuted in the book because Dr. Phil chose not to respond to any of the allegations in the book. I'm sorry to brake the news to people but Dr. Phil is a slimeball. He really did leave the members of his gym high and dry and and really was severely disciplined by the the licensing board for his sexual exploits with one of his clients. Its all public record. Sure there are people with axes to grind, but not everyone can be lying. The overall portrait is not a mistake. He is a very ambitious manipulative man who will succeed at all costs. Money is king to him. Don't believe the hype. Believe the people who actually worked with him. The book is competetantly written and it is so great to see what a hyprocite this pedantic jerk really is."
2,Just didn't satisfy.,"I don't think this was a ""bad"" book, or not well-written. I simply didn't like it very much. I was expecting a book that delved into who Dr. Phil really is, but from what I have gathered Dr. Phil was not even a participant in the writing of the book. Any insight into Dr. Phil's world comes from second or third parties or plain gossip.The book was well researched but it didn't have a lot to say that had not already been said before by someone else. I truly detested the so called ""Life Laws"" at the end! The book went from repetitive and a little boring to mean in the end.If you don't read the last chapter the book leaves you with a feeling that overall Dr. Phil is a good guy with an amazing business sense, but without any ""real"" knowledge of who Dr. Phil really ""is."""
1,90% Tabloid Journalism,"I found this book to be predominately Tabloid Journalism. The majority of the book has the exact same tone & phrasing & spin as the rag mags. Just like the rag mags do, the authors took a few facts, a lot of gossip & rumor then added their version of armchair psychology & spin to create a sensationalistic waste of money. When you're done reading, it feels more like you've read a fiction novel than legitimate non-fiction. As any good journalist knows, if you can't get enough corroborating sources, you don't run the story. So why did they bother? Money?"
1,Tabloid Junk,"I doubt the voracity of anything in this book... it is a way however for the author to use a famous name and face to promote herself. Fostering ""hate"" doesn't help anyone."
5,Human side of a TV icon,"I really enjoyed this well-written, fascinating book that peels off the studio makeup and shows the real man behind the quick psych soundbites of TV. As an entrepreneur, I was very intrigued to learn about the man's stumbles as well as his successes. The anecdotes in the book make it very readable and fun but I was looking for more and found it. I can't understand the reviews here that think the book has a negative agenda. Maybe the man's diehard fans expect that so see it where it doesn't exist. Don't be put off. If you want to learn about Dr. Phil, the real man and business wunderkind, this is your book."
1,Note: This review is regarding *EXPIRATION DATE ONLY*,"I purchased these in April of 2011 and regardless of what the text here says, all 100 condoms I received have an expiration date of August 2011. Four months is a FAR cry from the 2-3 years advertised! Maybe it's not an issue for some people who might view 100 as a month's supply (or less!) ;)I can't speak for the condom quality or fit, however, so please check other reviews for that information."
2,dd,What is there not like? I like the narrrative as well as the melody of most of Bobbie Bare's and Shelly Fabre's musi. I would recommend these used CDs to anyone who likes this type of music.
3,"Great Cover, but disappointing film","Let me just warn you the cover picture is not at all included in the film. Lots of nudiy/profanity, and 2 moderate sex scenes, and one rather long one. Sinful is a film that is described as a psychological thriller, but really isn't. Most of the film Misty Mundae walks around nude, but she isn't her best in this (as she was in MASTERS OF HORROR: SICK GIRL.) Sinful definatly could've been better. The cover is the reason why I gave it 3 stars otherwise I would've given it 2. The best pergformer was Erika Smith, because she is a rather good performer. Sinful is basicly copying the film (The Hand that Rocks the Cradle). I say this, because Lilith (Mundae) desperatly wants a baby, but cannot concieve a child, while Lilith and her husband are two new neighbors, next to Aisha (Smith) and her husband who has a child in Aisha's stomach. Lilith later becomes obsessed and decides thaat she must steal Aisha's baby girl."
3,VERY STRANGE AND ANNOYING LITTLE BIT,WELL THIS IS A STRANGE AND ANNOYING MOVIE THE MUSIC IS ALWAYS NEARLY THE SAME IT LOOK LIKE A FIRST MOVIE FROM THE DIRECTORWELL I ENJOY IT OK BUT THE MOVIE LAST 70 MINUTES AND IT WAS A BIT LONG TO WATCHI THINK THE FILMAKER DON'T LIKE BABYS SO MUCH AND HAVE A PROBLEME WITH THE PREGNANT LADY AND BIRTHSO WHAT CAN I TELL YOU MORE I LIKED IT BUT?????
5,Cheap upgrade for great sounds,"Installed these on my Mexican Standard Strat, easy install, I reused the stock screws instead of the ones supplied, worked great, sounds great in this basic box Strat. It's got the bright Pink Floyd sound now. Also found the best price on Amazon. better than the guitar supply houses !"
1,A real fake!!!,"The only problem with this book, is that it isn't true. Some research into the story shows how much the facts were twisted to suit a liberal agenda or some other twisted revisionist ploy at the expense to history. Although the author claims it is a ""novel,"" he also implies that it is well founded in the facts, which it is not in many regards. DON'T READ THIS BOOK!!!!!"
1,Rotten Book,"Bergon has put together a lousy book. Although it reads well, it does not comport with history. Bergon twists the facts, which are available with a little research, to suit his agenda. If I want propoganda, I will read propoganda. I don't need it in a Western historical novel."
2,Political/religious bias discolors content,Political/religious bias discolors conclusions of this book. Pipes is anti democratic and sponsors a bigoted campaign against scholars who disagree with his highly pro Islraeli views. Rational consideration of alternate views is not his goal -- in this he has something in common with the very Fundamentalists he hates. Some good knowledge and information are framed in strongly right wing prejudice. The book is helpful therefore only to those who already have considerable knowledge -- alone it promote bigotry and misunderstanding and the right wing agenda. Read by those with the same predisposition it will compound error.
1,Pipes never ceases to amaze...,Daniel Pipes never ceases to amaze me. The amount of fiction included in this book which he tries to pass as fact is laughable. What isn't laughable is his intent to write books like this in order to drive a wedge between people of different ideologies. The rhetoric in this book doesn't seem to far away from the anti-Semitic propaganda that was banded about during the second world war towards Jews.The point this fails to state is that this book is his own opinion not fact and as such this book should be read with that in mind or not at all.
1,"An appaling piece of the ""Right Wing"" corporate media...","This book is nothing but the author's sheer ignorance close to 10 billion muslims living worldwide. Extremism is not something that is ingrained in one religion or faith. If it so that were the case, then should we be prostelyzing the Hindu faith, for what a group of people who were involved in the massacres of thousands of people in the state of Gujarat in India in the name of religion?, the late Rev. Jim Jones who commited suicide, and had thousands of others do the same in the name of religion, the David Kuresh scandal in Waco,TX..so hence should we blame Christianity? Then on the Israel/Palestine conflict, it is not simply put it an Islamic issue..but an aparthied like situation, where there is a ""global"" outcry of socially conscious individuals who respect freedom, democracy, but also human rights, and a tolerance for all humanity regardless, which race, religion, or ethnic background.."
1,AKPharma Beano past expiration date,The expiration date was the same month as my shipment. Beano's expiration date should be a year or two out.
3,"They kinda work, but the solution works better","This is a pretty good deal on Beano tablets, which are a convenient way to get the necessary enzymes to avoid terminal flatulence. However, in my experience the Beano liquid that you dispense with the dropper generally works better.I have to eat 3 of these to really be effective, which means the 60 tablets in the bottle represent only about 20 doses. Keep that in mind when comparison shopping."
3,Broken Chips!,"Only three stars, because the Potato Chips are delivered broken. Has happened on a regular basis. When bought at the local grocery store, this is not a probem.Otherwise would give five stars, as the chips have very good flavor, and love that they are unsalted!"
2,Amazon Michael Season's Thin & Crispy Unsalted Potato Chips - Sad news,The taste was very good on this product but I bought the 12 pkg plan and the bags each were anywhere from 1/3 to 1/2 crumbs or small pieces you would only use on top of a casserole. No dipping or presentation wise nothing.However since I need unsalted chips they were worth a try and I need to cancel future orders of this one and stay with the Michael Season's kettle ones which of course were more durable and they too taste the same as the others.Amazon please note to cancel automatic shipping on this product but keep the one for the Kettle chips - thanks
2,dissapointed,"I was dissapointed this potato chips, tast ok, not very crunchy and all broked tiny pieces."
1,broken up to small pieces,"The chips tasted stale and were so broken up from poor packaging that I could only eat a few from each bag. The bags were crammed into a box that was lightweight, and thus, the problem. I will not be ordering them again."
5,Brilliant,"As a long-time admirer of William Scott's work, I found the Lynton book a reference and pictorial of extraordinary value, quality and beauty."
5,Ideal for a short course on Prolog,"For years I've tried to find a short Prolog text for my Computer languages course. I cover Prolog in 4 weeks and so didn't want a huge 400+ page text. Clause and Effect comes in at about 1/2 inch thick. I've come to love this one for what it does. It introduces some basic topics, then includes a number of ""worksheets"" at the end of each chapter. It offers a ""learning by doing"" approach (the worksheets are short ""lab exercises""). A word of warning - don't expect to learn everything about Prolog from this text. It does not go into the philosophy and theory of Prolog and logic programming. But for my needs it's perfect."
3,Ambivalent review,"I am of two minds about this book. On the one hand, it suggests surprisingly diverse applications of the language, some of which I never would have imagined, taking advantage of the language's unusual features. My main complaint is with the explicit source code, which is supplied without comments and where variables are often represented by obscure single letters rather than descriptive names, as would normally be the case with textbook examples. If you don't mind this shortcoming, I would recommend this book to anybody interested in Prolog."
2,"reel good, rod not so much","I bought this at Gander mountain two years ago.Today I set it up for the first time as my children are coming for a visit.Get this, the rod broke as I was setting the drag on the reel, pulling the line with my hand!!BTW, the drag was so loose that it was difficult to reel in the extra line.Completely unacceptable.I will write to manufacturer and let you know the results."
1,"Cheap Handle, don't waste money!","The reel does not fit snugly into the plastic handle of the pole.I went to cast and the whole pole flew int the lake!!! It was a nightmare @ 9,500' back-packing with this rod.I say there are better ways to fish with better rigs."
5,"Great idea, really nice for hiking!","I got these to take on some hiking trips and they have worked out extremely well.They are lightweight and durable, and eggs fit inside perfectly.Not one of my eggs ever broke while I carried them in this container over a lot of rough terrain.I highly recommend these if you want to have some eggs on the go and not worry about breaking them or making a mess."
5,"No cracks, no more egg theft at work.","I love this carrier for transporting a few eggs to work. Working in a oil refinery on 12 hr rotating shifts I cook most of my meals at work and my eggs would seem to slowly disappear during the week. As usual I searched Amazon and found this egg carrier, what a savings. I have not had any eggs crack and I just throw them in my bag with my other daily essentials for a days work. The egg thieves have to now actually pull out this bright yellow carrier and possibly be caught in the act."
4,Does the job,"There isn't really much to tell in a review about an egg holder, but it deffinatley does the job that it is supposed to. It holds hardboiled eggs very well without breaking them open. The plastic is durable enough to stuff into a backpack with many other things and not break. Would reccommend to anyone."
1,Not a good read at all,"I was really excited to get this book as I sometimes wonder if I'm worshipping and praying the right way. I understand now that acknowledging God involves more than saying your prayers and going to church. It's the way you think, talk, act, interact with others, so forth and so on. However, this book was just a bunch of nice sounding rhetoric. I got to page 22 and just dismissed it. It was very repetitive, it didn't get to the point, and it used language that was so unnecessary as far as attempting to get others to understand what is expected of us regarding praise and worship. It was simply awful."
4,Wish it had a belt clip option,"It's a good case, holds securely and attractive. The fit on it is fantastic, but it does scratch easily; I found that after 2 weeks of use there are quite a few scratches on the back. I wish it had a square hole in the back for a belt clip. You may run into some problems if you have a large headphone adapter. The one in my car is has a very thick base, and with this case on I was unable to plug my cable in. The cable is routed through my dash to the back of my stereo, so it isn't something I can easily replace with a thinner cable. I used a handheld rotary tool (Dremel type) to shave some of the plastic on the case (around where the cable plugs in).Review summary: Looses 0.5 stars for missing belt clip hole, looses 0.5 stars for headphone adapter spot, and looses 1 star for easily scratch. Gains 1 star for overall quality, fit vs. price."
5,Absolutely great,"This is definitely the one CJ album to buy if you are only going to have one. There is not a bad cut on this, and there are numerous great ones. ""Powderfinger"" by Neil Young & Crazy Horse is one of my favorite rockers, but in the CJ's hands it becomes an ethereal ballad. The CJ's version of ""Sweet Jane"" is likewise very different from the Velvet Underground's, but equally authentic. The most memorable cuts on this album, however, are the CJ's own songs. They remind me a lot of their Canadian countryman Gordon Lightfoot, with very intelligent lyrics and carefully crafted melodies. Their sound is unique, and Margo Timmins' voice should be declared a national treasure. I can't imagine why they aren't bigger stars. You won't regret adding this to your collection."
5,Exactly the book I wasa looking for!,I was very surprised and happy to find the book my son loved as a child. I bought it to give to him as he and his wife are expecting a son. He was very pleased and surprised.
4,Different product than ordered...seems to be working,"Very strange...we ordered the ""Get Off My Garden"" crystals and received the ""Away From My Garden"" crystals. They look pretty much the same...but I see that the same company is selling both on Amazon.It has a citronella-like smell, which we don't find offensive, but it probably is too strong for indoor use.As far as effectiveness, the weirdest thing happened. We got it because our dogs are digging in the yard, so we re-filled the holes and put the crystals IN the soil as well as on the top. The immediate response by our 10-month old lab mix was to sniff them and then ROLL around in them! However, in the past two days, none of those holes have been re-dug.We did have concerns about the features saying that this was a ""long-lasting"" product. The label on the back says specifically something about repeat application every 24 hours. We'll play it by ear. So far so good, though."
2,doesnt work,"i bought this to deal with an issue with my neighbour's dogs using my driveway and the road as the bathroom.It does nothing to them, they walk all over it and and it doesnt seem to affect them.Its a waste of money!"
3,Worked for a while,"Did work for a while, but the German Sheppard puppy eventually got around and used to the smell of it."
3,Sometime,This product worked for a couple of days warnig off the dogs and then my Pit got immune to it.
2,difficult to use,"this product seemed to work ok, but requires daily application and is a strange texture that is difficult to distribute"
2,"Good intro to WSDL, SOAP, and UDDI but light on JWSDP","At 250 pages, this book is a good introduction to Java web services but there just isn't enough material here to do serious Java development. The coverage of WSDL, SOAP, and UDDI gives a good overview but is too short for some actually deploying a web service. And there are only 26 pages devoted to JAX-RPC and JAXM, the most important Java APIs for web services. A better book is ""Building Web Services with Java"" (Sams) but even that has only a cursory review of Sun's Java Web Services Developer Pack. If you're a serious developer, you'll need to download JWSDP from Sun and go through the tutorial to learn the APIs."
1,Out of date,"I bought this, hoping to be able to use it on a web services project I'm doing.I find it's completely out of date. Both Sun's JWSDP and Apache Axis have moved on since this was written, and you'll get better information from their websites than you'll get from this book.Don't bother with it."
1,The content is dated!,The content in this book is a little dated. For a current book on Web Services check out either the Wiley book (Developing Java Web Services) or my favorite Java Web Services Architecture.
2,nice overview...but,"This book is a nice overview of Web Servcies and a high level descirption of the technologies involved. It does, however, lack the details of the inner workings of a Web Service. There is little or nothing mentioned on the rpcrouter servlet, deployment descriptors, the soap admin council and the scope of a web service. It is a good book for the developer who is looking for basics when starting out looking into web services, but not a real good book for developers at the next level."
4,good,"1.EYE OF THE STORM 5/5 - Sick opener. One of the best songs on the cd. Reminds me of something the used could come up with.2.FOLLOW YOU DOWN 5/5 - Not as good as track 1 but still a good song. Not the typical blindside.3.ALL OF US 5/5 - Good song, the video was on fuse the other day it's awesome.4.SHEKINA 5/5 - Probably the best song on the cd. Beautiful and sad.5.HOORAY, IT'S L.A. - 3.5/5 Weird song.6.SWALLOW 3.5/5 - Sounds familiar idk why.7.DIE BUYING 4.5/5 - Good song8.ACROSS WATERS AGAIN 5/5 - The chorus has a similar guitar riff to lost prophets-last train home9.AFTER YOU'RE GONE 4/5 - slow to explosion10.WHERE THE SUN NEVER DIES 5/5 - Sick song top 3.11.ROADS 3/5 - boring12.ABOUT A BURNING FIRE 4/5 - HEAVY"
3,Think About,"I had already been familiar with other Blindside productions, and my favorite song by them was ""Silence"". However, when I heard their new cd was out I rushed out to get it. I was a bit dissapointed, their sound is a bit watered down and doesn't sound as heavy as before. Although this might seem a bit not to good for the band the cd offers some good stuff. ""Where the Sun Never Dies, Eye of the Storm, Follow You Down, About A Burning Fire"", are the only good songs on the cd. ""Shekina"" could have been a lot better without the screaming girl in the beginning.Buy it used if you can."
3,"Musically solid, lyrically disappointing..","I have to say that Blindside rocks first off. I always respect a band that is creative with their sound and wants to venture into new worlds. Blindside has done exactly that on their new CD. However, though musically solid, the lyrics tended to venture off into a different direction. Lyrics like ""damned cold night"" and ""making love on a sunday afternoon"" make minds wonder what type of band blindside really is. I have no doubt that they are a Christian band, but I am disappointed by their lyrical effort on this latest disc. I hope they stick to their core Christian values on future efforts."
2,about a burning fire,"this album sucks. It is too soft even more than silence (which I liked). The old albums by blindside like the self-titled or ""a thought crushed my mind"" were really cool. But now the music is too soft.Really sucky"
4,Worth the money,"I think this is an album that takes a few listens. When I first heard it, I wasn't sure if I really liked it that much. But I listened to it a few more times, and now I just love it. It's not a perfect album, but the pros definitely outweigh the cons here. The songs ""Across Waters Again"" and ""Roads"" were dissapointing for me, but every other song on the album is awesome. Standouts for me are ""All Of Us"", ""Die Buying"", ""Where The Sun Never Dies"", and ""About A Burning Fire""."
4,"great cd, just as good if not better than silence","This cd is just as good if not better than silence. It's more experimental, highlights the band's strong points to a greater extent, and has everything silence had but more. Silence got me into the band and this album makes me a huge fan. I'm usually not a fan of all the crappy nu-metal bands out there like hoobastank (who really do stink), lost prophets, trapt (quite possibly the worst band of last year), and other boring bands of that sort. Blindside is unique, they have something very interesting going for them because they write catchy music that is at the same time very original. More than I can say for most bands. So support a great band, not just because they're on MTV, but because they write great music."
5,BLINDSIDE IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!,"i just found out about blindside, and I think they are a great band. Great lyrics. The lead singer has an amazing voice. Here is what I think of the songs. 1-EYE OF THE STORM- 8/10. 2-FOLLOW YOU DOWN-10/10 awesome song,my second favorite. 3-ALL OF US-100/10 my favorite,perfect chorus. 4-SHEKINA- 4/10. 5-HOORAY,IT'S L.A.-8/10. 6-SWALLOW-8/10. 7-DIE BUYING-9/10. 8-ACROSS WATERS AGAIN-8/10. 9-AFTER YOU'RE GONE-7/10. 10-WHERE THE SUN NEVER DIES-7/10. 11-ROADS-5/10. 12-ABOUT A BURNING FIRE-9/10. Overall this is a great cd. there are only 2 songs I dislike. Standout tracks include ALL OF US. FOLLOW YOU DOWN. ABOUT A BURNING FIRE. =please tell if this review was helpful="
2,About a burning cd,I'm really not into the new blindside cd. It doesn't sound like blindside. There are like 4 songs that I like and when i listen to the rest of the cd I hear no catchiness or anything great at all. So just send a dollar to the band and burn the cd cuz I don't think this cd would be worth $10.
3,a dissapointment,"I loved blindside's other albums,""A Thought Crushed my mind"", and ""Silence"". So I was quick to buy this album right when it came out. and I have to say I was disappointed majorly. It seems they have tried to get too far away from their roots. They are trying to much to be on MTV and stuff, too mainstream. My favorite album of thier's is A thought crushed my mind. That album is awesome. So all in all I was not impressed with this album."
5,My unsung hero,This is a brillent collection of short stories written by one of the most talented authors and literary critics of the 20th century.
2,Adds a touch of red under the hood...,"I used this TBS on a 'oo Bravada and the install was confusing using the included instructions. Take your time and look at everything in front of you and how the throttle body is set up and you'll have it figured out yourself much faster. As far as the ""whistle"", I haven't noticed it. My throttle response has improved, but only marginally. And as far as fuel efficiency goes, I've noticed a slight decrease of 1 to 2 MPGs. I wouldn't say I'm disappointed with this product, but I'm definitely not impressed."
5,okay for the money,worked fine no feedback. Maybe the other guys did something wrong like running rca next to or over power wires no issues here.
1,Terrible sound. The item does not put out the promised 300 watts.,It is mis advertised. The circuit board on the inside does not have enough power to put out the 300 watts that the prouduct should. I will NOT be recommending this to ANYONE.
3,"Works, some feedback.","It sounded great of 1st, had enough power, but now buzzes quite a bit all the time, even with the volume completely down."
4,INTERESTING IF YOU LIKE CHAMBER MUSIC,"NO MASTERPIECES AT ALL, BUT VERY INTERESTING TO COMPLETE A GOOD COLLECTION OF CHAMBER MUSIC. A DISCOVERY IN MY CASE."
1,Item featured not correspond to what I received...,The picture does not correspond to the item I received!!! The order was placed based on the item featured and it's not what I was looking to receive.
4,101 ways to show love to your child,"I always enjoy any books written by Vicki Lansky, but I am just a bit perturbed that a tiny little book costs $8.95 plus tax....she does offer words of widsom in dealing with children, and she is a well-respected author of self-help books about helping children cope with divorce."
3,Long live Jerry Reed,"I will definetly miss the story teller Jerry Reed. Had to get this album to remember him by. It has some of his best hits on it that I grew up with. Long live ""The Snowman"""
5,Jerry Reed,"The ""Snowman"" Sings as well as he acts!!Great music!!Great Item!Good old classic music!!Jerry Reed will ALWAYS be GREAT no matter what!!"
4,Excellent part 1 (Architecture ...) Bad part 2 (Backup...),I have passed the 1z0-023 (architecture...) easily only using that book. But I haven't passed the 1z0-025 (backup ...) whith that book because the 2'nd part is very unreal in relation with the actual exam.
3,Don't Read BACKUP & Recovery Part if you want to pass.,"I've previous experience in DBA before reading this book. The Architecture & Administration PART was excellent and cover around 95% of the test questions, but the second part Backup & Recovery was full of errors and not useful at all and doesn't cover more than 25% of the test questions, and only cover the titles of the test!!!!"
1,part 2 is horrible,"I passed IZ0-023, and I will do IZ0-025 next weekend. Part two is rubbish, and includes much more errors than oracle doc. I would suggest you cut it into two parts, just throw the part two away immediately after purchasing it."
1,Backup and Recovery is garbage,"Backup and Recovery part is garbage. It is full of logs. This is poorest book I ever read. Not only did it waste my money, but also my time. I past IZ0-025 with 53/60 after readingExam Cram book in a book store.However, the Architecure & Administration part is very good.This book can never be sold out without the Architecure & Administration part."
3,Low quality pump,"The ball is great and seems very durable, however it is very difficult to inflate to it's full size. The balance ring is also very difficult to fully inflate (and if it's not inflated fully it doesn't really serve a purpose becuase it won't make contact with the ball). I was very skeptical that it would reach the dimensions (65cm) and I don't think it did. So be sure to buy a ball bigger than you think you need! The pump broke 3/4th thru inflation of the ball . It's a very flimsy black plastic pump, so just be extra careful with it. Luckily it's a standard pump and if you have one to inflate a volleyball or any other recreational ball it should work just fine."
4,I Disagree! I loved this book.,"The characters were well written and interesting. The plot moved along well. It is not Patterson's usual detective novel, so maybe that is why his other readers weren't impressed. So far he has branched out into several different areas and all of them have been good. This novel is no exception."
2,Virgin,"I know this book was an old book, but it was so fragile and yellowed when it came that it should not have been sold for the price that it was. Had I know the real condition, I wouldn't have purchased it."
5,This book was moving and hurtful.,"This was a moving book. I was hurt, yet intrigued by the text and pictures of the brutality of slavery. If there are people out there who would not want children to read/see this book, it would be only because they are ashamed of what happened to a race of people by the hands of another people. The truth has been hidden and ignored long enough. Every American needs to know what our ancestors went through. I am still hurt by what I saw and read. A must have for every American."
1,"very graphic , should be rated at least PG-13","The book is a very graphic and vivid depiction of slavery in the United States. However, the text does not match the illustrations. The paintings attempt to show us the reality of slavery while the text seems to explore some meaningless (and potentially dangereous) mental exercises of Black pretend vs. White pretend,(e.g. If you are Black could you ever whip someone until their flesh bled red or if you are White could you toss a sick human overboard). Most importantly, this book should not be presented without parental consent and the child should be mature enough to understand the subject content."
3,Very supportive,Very good product. Not very sheer but that was probably my fault for not having checked first..!
4,perfect fit!,"Perfectly fit me. Although what I initially wanted to buy was the Spanx panty/girdle, this wasn't so bad. the bands perfectly reach my waist and the crotch area is snug in fit. I want to buy this product in black and nude to match different outfits!"
2,If only they lasted!,"I was in love with these nylons! I bought two pair one in black and one in nude, they felt great, my tummy was tucked, my legs looked fab. However, on day one I had a run two hours into my work day, and with the second pair on day two I had a run 5 hours into it. So, over $50 for two pairs of nylons that couldn't even last through the work day. :( Real bummer because I LOVED them! I would definetly reccomend these if they would only last!"
3,Tummy control?,"I liked the tummy control it had, however, after wearing them the second time I had so many runs in them. I paid 20+ Dollars and I can't even wear them again because of the runs. I only wore them to work and back home again."
2,Runs on first wear! Waste of money,"These hose are too expensive for a single wear - none, in my case. They ran as soon as I put them on! They are too delicate and run immediately. Be careful. They are expensive and run immediately"
3,too many runs in too little time.,"You would think these pantyhose would last a while seeing that they are $26 dollars. However, the second day I wore them to work I discovered a run just be leaning against something. They did fit very well and were quite comfortable for pantyhose. I was just disappointed with the quality and wear-ability."
5,Great addition to Rotary Table,This makes the Sherline rotary table usable on a wide range of applications in vertical orientation. It just workswith the table and saves time. This is a great value.
2,"works great as a keyboard, fails miserably on range","First off, when used for what it's intended, it works fine. Using it on my PC in the basement is great. My original intent for this wireless keyboard was to control a HTPC I built that is about 5' away. Needless to say, I found that my range is literally 12"" or less with this combination. So if you don't need range, works great, mouse and keyboard. If you need range, wrong product. I'm still baffled to find any documenation which shows the range of this combination"
3,Okay product,I really like most logitech products because you can see that they research and test most of there products. This may be the exception. It works pretty darn good once you have it connected. However its a real pain in the arse to get connected. I would recommend something else to others because of that one reason.Once you have it connected its a great product and have no issues.
2,Very Limited Range,I got this keyboard to use in my Living Room. I have to be less than 6 feet from the sensor or it does not work. The range on this keyboard is absolutely terrible.
2,mouse and keyboard have mechanical problems,"This unit combo looks nice, but I have had problems since new - almost 10 months ago. I think I got the setup by luck because it did not react anything like the setup guide said. The battery life has been pretty good though; I eat a set about every 3 months.The space bar sticks constantly, and the mouse does not respond to the left button click, and often does not track correctly. I can't figure it out. I've really got to pound the mouse button to get response. ""Why not send it back"" you might ask? Well, truth be told, it is a work computer and my boss is just kind of dense, you know, like a fence post. So I need to cough up the cash myself and today I just can't take it any more."
4,Well Priced Ergonomical Wireless Bundle,"I was pleased with the performance, ease of use and comfort of this keyboard/mouse combo. I am a loyal Logitech customer due to their quality products throughout their product line. Having that said, I spilled about a teaspoon of liquid on the keyboard and it stopped working completely and indefinitely. This would be completely expected if I had spilled it on the buttons but it was on the actual keys, which I have done to other keyboards in the past (including another logitech) with no problems. This one, however, was toast after less than a month of use. Regardless, water and keyboards don't really work well together so I gave the item 4 out of 5 stars anyways."
3,A Logical Choice,"Keyboard:I was able to easily use this several feet away from my computer and the battery life is way above average. I found the keys pretty easy to type on. A small complaint I have is that it has sort of large weird design that takes up too much space on my desk. The short cut buttons on the top I usually don't use makes the keyboard much larger than it needs to be. It is also frustrating when the plastic piece falls off. If the design was sleaker I would give it a 4 or 5 stars.Mouse:Battery life is a little short, and when the battery is about 3 quarters of the way done I have to keep pressing the button on the bottom side of the mouse to get it to work. Also, the clicking action is a little noisy for my taste, I wound up keeping the wireless keyboard but replacing the mouse with a plug in one."
2,Hard-to-see letters and weak wireless reception,"The letters printed on the keys are tiny and hard to see, especially in low light. Older buyers beware of this!Also,the wireless receiver is weak. With keyboard and mouse two feet to one side of the computer tower, and with the little wireless receiver plugged into a front USB port on the tower, mouse movement was often not picked up by the receiver. Very frustrating. Plugging the receiver into a USB port on the rear of the tower gave even worse results. Now using a Logitech VX220 wireless mouse which works much better, and got a wired keyboard which is backlit and has large letters (Saitek Eclipse lighted keyboard). Outstanding!Saitek Eclipse Keyboard ( PZ30AU )"
4,Logitech wireless desktop trumps Microsoft version,"After owning a Microsoft wireless desktop for one year, the Enter key mysteriously broke. Mind you, I've had other keyboards in personal and professional environments for many years so I'm confident I wasn't treating it like Samsonite luggage. Thankfully, from the first day, the Logitech version has better connectivity and touch-sensitivity than my previous Microsoft version."
3,Annoying!,"I don't know what happened with this particular item but I have nothing but problems with the mouse! The keyboard works great, I have never has to use the connect button, or reset for it either - but the mouse is another story. I am always having to click the connect button! Everytime I go to use the computer, connect, or reset has become part of the process! I thought maybe it is just the batteries I use, so I tried rechargebale ones, and ones meant to last longer, and the more traditional ones too - problem still exist! I gave up finally put the mouse away - still use the keyboard. The quick access buttons are great, took some getting use to because I was always use to using the mouse to do everything. Overall I would said it is worth the money!"
5,Just what I wanted,"I was looking for good balance of features and price and this product delivered. Absolutely easy to install, worked first time, and has functioned as advertised. I was pleasantly surprised by how good the feel of the keyboard is. Can't go wrong with package."
1,Not a very durable or reliable product,"About three months after my wife and I purchased the LX300 Desktop, we experienced a complete keyboard failure. After performing everything suggested on the Logitech website, no luck. It had worked well for those three months and we were very disappointed when it stopped working. We completely felt dupped by Logitech on this product. You might want to take a look at a better quality product made by another manufacturer. Avoid the headaches we went through trying to get this one fixed."
5,A Solid Wireless Keyboard and Mouse,"This wireless keyboard/mouse combo make a solid pair. I originally was looking for just a mouse, but decided that it'd probably be good to have a keyboard to go along. It's got way more buttons and features than I use currently, but having volume control on the keyboard has turned out to be really handy. I'm currently using it at about 8' from the receiver and both the mouse and keyboard work great."
5,Perfect cordless keyboard & mouse,it works perfectly without any troubles. this keyboard has lot of features for multimedia and other system functions. i strongly recommend to buy this product.
1,No INSERT or ESCAPE keys!!!,"The keyboard and mouse work fine, except for some completely absurd reason, Logitech decided to remove the INSERT and ESCAPE keys from the regular keyboard and make them little buttons on the top of the keyboard instead. Look at the picture and you will see what I mean -- the DELETE key is double-size and takes up the space where the insert key would be; INSERT is moved above the home key and is a little recessed round button. ESCAPE is in the usual place, but it too is a little button instead of a legitimate key. Very annoying. Definately returning it."
4,"quite good, but mouse does not work in linux mode","it is a good product, the only problem i am facing is that the mouse does not let me do cut-paste using the middle button when i am using cygwin on my windows machine."
3,OK,"For the price I paid ($20 after rebate), it was a good buy.Cons:1. Squeaky mouse button2. Some of the programmable keys do not work. (Open webpage shortcut never worked for me)3. 8 inches distance might be too short for some, it does the job in my office.4. Insert and Esc keys have unusual designs and places. IF you use those keys a lot, you will not like this keyboard.5. Does not have zoom function on the keyboard.Pros:1. Keyboard keys are really nice and easy to type with.2. Saves a lot of space.3. Very programmable and customizable."
4,"good keyboard, worth the money!","The keyboard is great, it has shortcuts which you can custimize to your preference, works well, the mouse is okay too. Battery life lasts about 4 days, But the cons of the mouse is it looses reception, so the mouse may feel like the battery is dying, but its just the connection. But i reccomend...get the keyboard, and purchase another mouse seperatly."
5,Wireless Keyboard/Mouse,"This keyboard and mouse work great! We received it quickly, plugged it in, set it up and off we went! No problems."
4,Logitech 300 Cordless Keyboard and Mouse,I really like the keyboard it is very quiet while typing and is what I happen to be typing this reply on now. I really like the keyboard and the features that can be programmed into it. It seems to be very user friendly which is very nice. The mouse is a little small but it works well and overall I'm pleased with this purchase.
1,Waste of money and time!,When I got the lx300 from logitech it was working great especially with games. Three months later it started to lag constitally. I called logitech and told me to try all these ideas and not one of them worked. I am very disatisfied with the product and company.
3,Be careful,"Although it does not mention it anywhere in the specs, this setup REQUIRES a PS2 port on your PC for the mouse to work. If you bought a newer computer like I did, you may not have a PS2 port. I stupidly thought USB ports would be sufficient but Logitech thinks otherwise."
4,No problems so far,"If I had read the previous reviews prior to purchasing the LX300 I would probably have been scared off. However, I have to report that after a month, everything is working just fine. Installation was a breeze and the functionality is much better than my previous keyboard/mouse. Whilst the mouse isn't the sleekest on the market it isn't a 'brick' either. I have not observed any 'wandering mouse syndrome' yet. For the price, this combo seems to be good value for money."
5,Excellent Purchase,This set responds rapidly and has a long battery life. I had the Logitech Bluetooth Lazer set and tossed it. I purchased this set instead of the Bluetooth and Love it. My husband ended up tossing his Bluetooth for one like this also.
4,Works great!,"Allows me to keep my laptop off my desk, and works fine for me at about 7 feet away. Battery life has been good so far. My only complaint is the scroll wheel on the mouse is loud. I love the volume controls and program shortcuts on the keyboard!"
3,not good at a distance,This product is fine if you are working within just a few feet from your computer. I wanted to use it from across the room with my projector system and after about 6 ft the mouse stops working and freezes up. It works intermittently but I will probably return it because it is frustrating. I suspect that all other products in this price range have the same problem.
2,A good entry level cordless keyboard IF you are going to replace it soon,Good inexpensive cordless setup but loses it's connection frequently and when it's installed with inexperienced customers that's a very large pain.Personally I wouldn't recomment it just based on that.Otherwise it's pretty good on battery life. We only used the keyboard and tossed the mouse in the trash as we had another option to use there.
2,Disappointing.,Watching this dvd is like going hawkwatching without a telescope and see all birds far away. Close-up views would have helped to learn characteristics.
4,Great DVD guide for identifying raptors in flight,"I found this DVD to be very informative on how to identify several types of raptors found on the US East coast. It has excellent camera work in filming the birds and you get clear and detailed video action and explanation of the identifying marks and behaviors of these birds in flight. However, I found that I was wishing for more photos of these birds sitting still in trees, on poles or fences, etc...as this is how I see them most often. The DVD cover did in fact show them in flight and that's exactly what was on the DVD, so I was still very glad I bought it. I have watched it several times already and have had much more success identifying the birds I have seen since."
3,"Beautiful illustrations, but too scary for very young kids","This is a lovely book, but the story was too frightening for my 3 1/2 yr old. The story includes a baby and cat being washed away in a flood and rescued at the last minute. Maybe better for older kids."
5,Educational & Entertaining Book,"After visiting Holland in March, I bought this children's book for my grandson. It is a great read aloud for now and as he grows a good book to read on his own. Not only is it a very good story, it educates children about the Netherlands and their constant stuggle with keeping the sea away from the land areas where the Dutch live. It also incorporates an animal (which children love) as a companion and hero. At the back of the book it explains the Kinderdijk Windmills and I was able to write about my visit there so he will be able to read about my story when he's a bit oder."
3,Not practical,I did not find this book very helpful for practical work. It contains essentially a collection of material by different authors that can also be found in IEEE-Journals. The really important things are formulatet mathematically (f.ex. how to compute noise spectra using HB-analysis). Of course this material is useful if you happen to have the time to write your own HB-simulator. If the reader is looking for practical design hints and worked circuits to he will not really be happy with this book.
4,Ecellent detailed oscillator noise analysis,"This book gives you some new view points of phase noise analysis in oscillator cuircuits, and helps you to build low close-in phase noise system."
5,Judge Dee mystery novels - super read for mystery lover and historians alike!,I love all the Robert van Gulik mysteries! What an intriguing mix of brilliantly plotted mysteries with a wonderfully authentic look at ancient Chinese culture! I recommend this series to anyone.
5,i cant wait,wow i have been down loading the entrances for the new smackdown and a teaser trailer and some with ppl playing and it looks great but i heard that they did not change the rko from last years cause that one sucks and cena's but yea i cant wait and im not dissapointed all the ppl i always am are on there but i do wish luther reigns was on there and i think they should have taken the bra and panties matches out i like them on tv not on a videogame and the person talking about the rock he is on there i have seen some pics they said he is a ledgend on there now well it looks great
1,not good for kids under 15,"although the game came in great condition, the moral quality was not up to par for a kid under 15 years of age. They swore throughout the game and showed women scantily dressed. Inappropriate for my 9 year old who purchased this with his own money unfortunately."
1,Knowing how to play a game like this garbage.,"Its only a matter of time before anybody who knows how to play this game & I for one who certainly knows how to play it. But do to the gameplay against CPU's is the only problem. Everytime you fight against it, it counters you back like a mad man & you can't fight back. Thats why this game will rot in hell! Don't get it!"
1,KNOW IT OR SUCK IT!,"DEFINATELLY SUCK IT, THIS GAME REEKS! I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT MANY PEOPLE LIKE THIS GAME & FELT FOR MCMAHONS TRAP, NOT ME THOUGH! THEY'RE ONLY ZOMBIFIED BY VINCE RIGHT NOW, BUT SOON, IT'LL ALL END! SOON SOMEONE WHO BREAKS OUT OF MCMAHONS SPELL & GETS HIS/HER SENSES TOGETHER WILL SHOVE THIS GAME IN VINCE'S ASS!!!!"
1,GETTING THE JOB DONE?,"AS MUCH AS THIS GAME IS WHAT SHOULD I SAY, UNFINISHED! ITS TRUE, IT IS UNFINISHED AS FAR AS THQ GOES. NOT ONLY IT LACKS, BUT IT ALSO DON'T HAVE HESITATION FOR FUN! I DO BELIEVE THAT WWE GAME FANS CAN GO TO STRIKE SOON, I'M IN!"
1,FOOLISH CHUMPS!,"IT ONLY AGGRAVATES ME MORE THAT VINCENT KRAPPY MCMAHON PICKS A FIGHT WITH HBK & HAVE HIS SON SHANE & HIS DAUGHTER STEPHANIE TO DO HIS DIRTY WORK FOR HIM! NOT ONLY THAT, SINCE NOBODY & I CAN'T TRUST VINCE'S WIFE LINDA NO MORE, ITS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE HE SENDS HIS WIFE TO DO DIRTY TRICKS ON HBK. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, HBK IS GONNA WHIP VINCES ASS AT WRESTLEMANIA JUST LIKE THIS GAME IS GONNA GET ITS ASS WHOOPING! WHAT I WOULD DO TO THIS GAME IS GIVE IT THE FINGER & STOMP A MUDHOLE, STONE COLD STYLE!"
1,"HERE COMES THE PAIN HAS FADED AWAY, TAIDAMN!","WELP, SAY FARWELL TO HCTP & SAY HELLO TO ""YAWN"" SVR. THE GAME THAT WILL CHANGE PEOPLES LIVES FOREVER INTO HAPPINESS & MORE JOYFUL TO THE WORLD, YEAH RIGHT. THIS GAME IS BORING & YOU CAN'T LITERLLY CONTROL ANY TYPE OF MOVEMENT CONTROLS HERE. FRUSTRATING MOST OF ALL WOULD BE THE GAMEPLAY, THE MOST IRRITATING & AGGRAVATING PART OF THE GAME OF IONS IN THE WORLD TODAY! NO WAY THIS GAME EVER HYPED ME UP, AND WHEREVER YOU PEOPLE COME & NEVER HEARD BAD THINGS ABOUT THIS GAME, DO PLEASE HEAR IT! IT ONLY SAVES YOU A BUNCH OF MONEY!"
1,MANY FLAWS HERE!,"A LOT OF FLAWS LIKE EDGE IS CLEAN IN THIS GAME WHICH HE'S DIRTY IN REAL LIFE. RHYNO IS IS CLEAN IN REAL LIFE BUT HE'S LISTED AS DIRTY IN THIS GAME. JBL IS NOT MUSCULAR ANYMORE BUT IN THIS GAME HE IS & FEW OTHERS ARE OUT OF SHAPE TOO. MATCH LIKE PLB WAS ONLY ONE NIGHT. SEASON & CREATIONS ARE PATHETIC INCLUDING THE LACKLUSTER BELT CREATION. CPU'S ARE STUPID, THEY DON'T FIGHT AS MUCH AS THEY GO INSIDE & OUTSIDE OF THE RING & EVEN TAUNT YOU. THE ROCK IS NOT A LEGEND, HE LIKE WRESTLED 6 YEARS & THATS ABOUT IT, HE'S DONE WRESTLING. HE'S GONE, VANISHED, NO MORE, & MOST OF ALL, A SELL OUT TO BE A MOVIE F**KING UP STAR & ALL HIS FILMS SUCK HORRIBLY & TERRIBLY. ALL IN THIS GAMES IS YOURS TO KEEP, I DON'T NEED IT! BUT I TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, IF YOU WHERE IN MY SHOES, YOU WOULD DO THE SAME DAMN THING TOO!"
1,Shove this game down the toilet!,"You heard me, shove this crap in the toilet and flush it hard, real hard! Cause you won't find anything good in this habitizing game. You won't also find any fun with this game at all because its complete rubush. Futhermore, its also pointless. Don't get this game!"
1,HELP!,"THIS GAME IS TRYING TO HURT ME WITH GAMEPLAY TROUBLE AND I CAN'T EVEN SLEEP AT NIGHT!! BECAUSE I KEEP ON DREAMING THAT I WAS ACTUALLY IN THE GAME GETTING BEAT UP AND GOT BRUISES ALL OVER MY BULKED UP FACE! THIS GAME IS HORRIBLE, TAKE IT AWAY FROM ME, HHHHHHHHHHHHEEEEEEELLLLLPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Get This Game Off Of My Back!,"The game is for kids under 14 people, this is not for teens, mature adults, or adults. They just did that commercial just to waste your darn money. So say this to them jackasses THQ, ******************** y'all!"
1,NO NEED YOUR F**KDAMNED GAME ANYMORE VINCE!,"GAMES LIKE THIS WISHED YOU WANTED TO PLAY THE PAST WWE GAMES FOR PS1 LIKE THE SELFTITLED OR KNOW YOUR ROLE! I HAVE TO ADMIT THOUGH, VINNY MAC SURE KNOWS HOW TO PISS THE CROWD OFF EASLY & LOSES HIS F**KING MONEY! HE'S ALSO A F**KING IDIOT WHEN IT COMES TO SUPERSTAR RELEASES & GAME MAKINGS! THIS GAME IS A SOLID FAILURE & YOU WON'T EVER LIKE ANOTHER WWE GAME EVER AGAIN!"
1,"People who have hate for this game, DO!!!!!","Shu, I would if it was up to me, & personally, I don't even remember how I bought this game. I rented first to try it out & then quittich, I took it back to the Movie Gallery place & dumped it down the slot. By then few months later. I went to sleep & then something surprising was under my pillow. I looked & I was like what the sh^t! It was that lousy crappy game only it was mine now, NNNOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!! My mother & father said happy birthday son, we've bought this wrestling game for you because we know how much it means to you to like wrestling & games like this. (...)!"
1,Play this game until it bores you like ****!,"Yeah, everybody's a critic when it comes to crap like this! Until everyone realizes that reality checks always not too far behind, or even in front your faces. Vince & THQ are good at doing that to people like me, & it'll probably happen to you too hippy boy! Thats why they created a frustrated, unwanting game that everybody's waiting & dying to buy it! But when it comes to put up or shut up, then they get tired of it because it lacks & it sucks! This game gets so boring easily they even do a shortcut to get rid of this game & you know how they do it? They crush it with utensils, thats what they do! If it was me, I would of taken a shortcut but I trade it for money only, but you can destroy it if you want to! Thats the bottomline, cause Stonecold says so!"
1,WWE SOLD OUT LIKE THE ROCK DID!,"FIRST THE ROCK, NOW WWE? WHAT HAPPENED VINCE? WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GOOD FEATURES AND ALL THAT GOOD GAMEPLAY SH&T? THIS GAME IS NOTHING BUT A SELLOUT LIKE WWE IS. I CAN'T BELIEVE I PURCHASED THIS PIECE OF DOG TURD, NOT ANYMORE THOUGH. I'M GLAD I SOLD THIS AFTER I BOUGHT IT. I PLAYED IT QUICK AND I WAS FINISHED CAUSE IT SUCKS LIKE **********. I NEVER EVEN WATCH WWE AGAIN AFTER I PLAYED THIS GAME. WHERES THE OLD SCHOOL WRESTLING THESE DAYS? AS LEAST THEY ARE MORE CLASS ACTS THAN WWE. TNA IS SOMETHING LIKE! TNA DEFEATS WWE, MY KIND OF RESULTS!"
1,"FUN, HELL NA!!!!","YOU GUYZ CALL THIS GAME FUN? ITS NOTHING BUT PURE GARBAGE! EVERYTHING IN THIS GAME SUCKS! THE GAMEPLAYING, FEATURES, CREATING BELT & CHARACTERS, PPV CREATIONS, THE STORY/SEASON, MATCHES, ENDING, AND MORE OF IT SUCKS! I'M GLAD I'D NEVER BOUGHT A WWE GAME AGAIN AT ALL NO MOE! I'M STARTING TO LISTEN MOE CD'S OFTEN INSTEAD LIKE SNOOP DOG, HE RAPZ THE JOINT Y'ALL. F**K VINCE THAT F**KED UP BAMBOO!"
1,The game that has gone down the route to society!!!!,"Thats right y'all! You're looking for a game that has new story, gameplay, character creation, belt creation, and other features. But you know what else, the game is the most immediately full of emotional, you know what I mean. That my friends is hate emostions, yes hate. Cause this game right here and now is down right a failure. Failure for WWE fans and gamers, even hardcore fan gamers. Sorry chaps, but thats the way the cookie crumbles. You will get any respect from this game, its just pointless here.So go do something about it & f**k up them bamboo's that made this game."
1,Why?,"Why 1 star rating, cause this game reeks! Everything in this game mainly sucks! Nothing new here, its like making older games again. Theres no title matches here and season mode is downright awful! The whole gameplay is cheating, even if you put it on easy. Bottomline, this game sucks, throw it down the river if you have to, cause I did!"
1,As if this game would never come to an end!,"This game reminds me of a maniac that wants to kill someone in a parking lot garage than a WWE brawl? That really is funny at first until you play the game, its sad & dumb. Season mode here is full of confusion and also full of stupidity, makes no damn sense at all. The guy says ""if you really wanted to do something about it. Why don't you come to this ring right now""! Yeah sure thing buddy go figure! Its like watching a spy movie. But this game is for teletubbies here, only they would play this game. I don't care if your hardcore gamers, you dudes won't be hardcore WWE fans for this game very long, I'll promise y'all that!"
1,"STOP IT RIGHT NOW THQ, THIS HAS GONE BY FAR ENOUGH!","YOU MIGHT HAVE MADE SOME GOOD MONEY FOR THIS GAME, BUT WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? I MEAN, ITS NOT HCTP OR SYM AND NOT EVEN THE PAST WWE GAMES FOR PS1! THIS GAME IS DOPEY AND POINTLESS, AND YOU CAN'T EVEN TAKE BUMPS IN THIS LACKLUST CRAP!! THQ, GIVE YOURSELVES UP FOR NOW, CAUSE THIS GAME NEVER GAVE ME E-ENERGY AT ALL! YOU GUYS CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT! YOU HAVE 3 STRIKES OR I'M NOT GOING TO BUY YOUR GAMES AGAIN! THIS WAS THE FIRST STRIKE! REMEMBER THAT!"
1,NO WAY IN HELL AM I GOING TO,"FORGET THIS!!!!!!!! THIS GAME IS STUPID & LACKING!! I HATE THIS GAME!! IT GIVES YOU NO INSTRUCTIONS WHAT TO DO WITH THIS OR THAT!! THE BOOK ITSELF CAN'T EVEN SAVE YOU NOW NEITHER MY FRIENDS!!!!!!!! JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT EVERRTHING IN THIS GAME WOULD HAVE SOMETHING, WELL IT DOESN'T HAVE EVERYTHING BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS HERE THAT IS FULL OF CRAP, NOTHING NEW!!!!!!!!! SO DON'T COMPARE THIS TO HERE COMES THE PAIN CAUSE ITS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO HERE COMES THE PAIN! THIS GAME IS MADE BY AN INFANT CHILD ONLY, AND THIS GAME IS FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD ONLY, NO ADULTS PEOPLE!!"
1,YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT THOSE TRUTHS!,"YOU CAN LIE OR DENY ALL YOU WANT TO SAY GOOD STUFF & THINGS ABOUT THIS GAME, BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING SON! YOU CAN'T REALLY TRUST ANYBODY, NOT EVEN THE LIKES OF THQ THAT PUT THIS GAME THROUGH HELL WHEN YOU FIRST EXPLORE THIS FUTURE RUST! I HAPPENED TO TELL YOU THAT ITS NOT THE GAME REALLY, BUT ITS THE CREATERS THAT DESTROYED THE FEATURES HERE THAT SHOULD OF BEEN IN HERE AND SO I RETURNED IT IN FOR MY FULL CASH BACK! I SUGGEST YOU DO THE SAME CAUSE THERES NO HELL TO LIKING THIS GAME AT ALL AND IT ONLY JUST PUTS YOU DOWN LIKE YOU WOULD SAY ""FINISHED""!!"
1,"THIS GAME REEKS, GIVE IT BACK TO THE STORE, PRONTO!","GOOD RIDENCE FOR THIS GAME, GOSH I HATED IT! IT HAS NO HARDCORE BACKSTAGES AT ALL AND NO LUMBERJACK OR I QUIT WHICH REALLY SUCKS! I GIVE NO CARE FOR TLC, LAST MAN STANDING, SUBMISSION, FIRST BLOOD, AND PARKING LOT BRAWL, BECAUSE THEY'RE AREN'T BASICALLY SPECIALTY MATCHES! BRA & PANTIES MATCHES ARE ALL RIGHT, BUT ITS ALSO A WASTE OF MATCHES! SEASON IN THIS GAME ISN'T VERY IMPROVED AT ALL AND THERES NO SHOW TRANSFER OR CHOOSING OTHER CHARACTER MATCHES WHICH YOU CAN'T DO ANYMORE!! I ALSO HATE THE CREATIONS CAUSE THEY'RE REALLY CHEAP IN THIS GAME AND THEIR FACES ARE LIKE, EW DAMN! EVERYTHING ELSE IS YOUR OPINION, AND MY IS ALREADY MADE IF YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS!"
1,ARE YOU KIDDING ME? YOU DUDES THINK THIS GAME IS FUN?,"HELL NA IT ISN'T FUN, AND I'M SERIOUSLY TICKED THE WAY THEY MADE THE CPU'S POSE EACH OTHER AND GOING IN & OUT, IN & OUT, IN & OUT, AND IN & OUT OF THE DAMNGONE RING EVERY DAMN TIME! IT GETS ON MY NERVES WHEN THEY GET LIKE THAT, ITS EMBARASING TO THE LIVE CROWD, AND HOME PEOPLE TOO! THEY THINK THIS GAME IS FOR LITTLE CHILDREN OF SOME SORT OR A PLAYBOY GIRLY GAMES, WHAT? I PLAYED BETTER GAMES THAN THIS SIDE SHOW WANNA BE, AND I DEFINATELY PLAYED A LOT OF MORE BOXING GAMES NOW A DAYS THAN WRESTLING CAUSE I FIGURED IT OUT THAT BOXING IS MORE PROFESSIONAL THAN WRESTLING!"
4,Fun WWE Game,"This game is a lot of fun, but not as good as its predecessor Here Comes the Pain imo. It has nice backstage areas to fight in, tlc matches which are always fun and the great elimination chamber match. The story is good and it is a fun game to play with your friends, but it doesn't have some things that i really liked in HCTP. Some of those things were a title belt hanging for to try to grab in the TLC match. Also it doesn't have an interactive backstage area during story mode in which you can see wrestlers backstage, talk to them and possible fight them. All in all it is a fun game which I enjoy."
3,SmackDown vs Raw,"This game is really great.The graphics are terrific and the gameplay is awesome!I love the classic legends like Bret Hart, Roddy Piper, Jimmy Snuka, Mankind, and others.The only thing I did'nt like was how short the season was and how when you're in season your wrestler cant talk but eveyone else can but everything else was great and I recommend this game to any wrestling fan!"

1,Take this game to Vinny Mac's ***!,"Thats would I do best for my first & last option is to dig a hole in Vinces a** & bury this game in it! Now that my friends, is off the hook!"
1,Worst than SvR 2006.,"Everybody's wondering if the first SvR is better than part 2? Hell no its not better than part 2, its worse than part 2! No good features, creations, story mode & cutscenes, or even game fighting styles when you fight against CPU's. The CPU's act like child like crap & hardly ever fight you in the ring. They'll take advantage of you though if another dude hits you from ""behind"" like a motherf^^king coward that he is or make a mistake & crap like that. I played The Rock against a created supertstar & I got my ass whipped by that dude & he pinned me 1-2-3 for the pin fall & I was pissed off. If you have temper problems like me, then don't even buy this game at all. I broke this disc in half & threw it at the poster of Vince McMahon that money hungry motherf**ker. I hope he goes out of business in the near future some how. That'll rock the socks off! Oh hell yeah!"
1,This game is for ****s only!,"If you're a ****, then this game is for you then. If you're not a ****, then follow my lead dude. By taking this game & burn down to hell where it belongs & make sure it is burnt real good!"
1,WHO'S COMPLAINING?,"THATS A FUNNY ONE. ME THATS WHO & LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING HERE SON. YOU SEE THIS GAME RIGHT HERE? IT HAS NO TOLERENCE OF FUN AT ALL & DOESN'T HAVE ANY PLEASURE MAKING YOU FEEL HAPPY OR SHOULD I SAY, A FA**ET! WELL THIS GAME WILL MAKE YOU A FA^^ET ANYWAYS BECAUSE THE WAY THE GAME CHANGES INSIDE YOU & SH%T. VINCE IS TRYING TO MAKE PEOPLE GAY, THATS ALL HE'S DOING BY MAKING COPY'S OF THIS CRAP RIGHT HERE & MAKING SURE YOU STAY GAY FOR A LONG F@@KING TIME! WELL NOT ME, I GOT A GIRLFRIEND & SOLD THIS SH^T TO THE DUMPSTER OF VINCE'S ***!"
1,The motherf**kers who let us all down like Vince & THQ!,"Don't even get this game, the game is pointless and dumb! It has no sense making and or subsribing it! Good luck people, you'll need this review helpful, so screw them motherf**kers THQ & Vince McMahon! They care about the money, NOT THE WWE FANS!!!!!!!!"
1,THIS GAME IS A BLO OUT! TIME TO HIT THE GYM!,"RIGHT NOW, THIS GAME MADE ME OUT OF SHAPE! BECAUSE I USED TO BE A BIG MACHO GUY AND A HAPPY MAN. BUT NOW, EVER SINCE I'VE GOT THIS GAME, NOW I'M OUT OF SHAPE & NEVER WORKED OUT AGAIN! THIS GAME SUCKS, I'M GOING BACK TO THE GYM AND WORK OUT LIKE EXTRA HOURS. I USED TO BE A GRUMPY GUY AFTER I BOUGHT THIS GAME. I'M GLAD THAT I OUT THIS GAME OUT OF MISERY BY DOING IT IN MY **********, CUZ THIS GAME REEKS SERIOUS BUSINESS. BY THE WAY, MY NAME IS EGGNOM, THE MAN WHO HATES NOW WWE! BY THE WAY, TIME TO HIT THE GYM!"
1,THIS IS LIKE WATCHING A CLASSIC KID'S SHOWS!,"ONE THING I WOULD LIKE TO SPECIFY THAT SVR FOR THIS GAME IS COMPLETE UNWANTED! BIG SHOW DOESN'T DEMAND SOMETHING LIKE A MADMAN, COME ON! HE ALSO DON'T MOVE QUICK IN REAL LIFE, BUT IN A GAME! NOW THATS EXTREMELY F^^KED UP! ONLY LITTLE CRUISERWEIGHTS WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. ALSO, REY MYSTERIO WALKS UP TO A GIANT? NOT IN REAL LIFE HE DOESN'T! THESE GAMES LIKE THESE HAVE NO MEANING TO OFFER. NO SUBJECT MATTER HAS ANYTHING HERE EITHER. NO REFERENCES WHAT SO EVER OR DISPLAY CONCLUSIONS. THE GAME IS A FLOP, BOTTOMLINE. THE GAME IS ALSO THAT EVERYONE WOULD SAY SUCKS! NOTHING IN THIS GAME NEVER HEATS ME UP AT ALL. IT DOESN'T EVEN GIVE ENERGY TO ME AT ALL. GAMES LIKE THIS SHOULD BE IN THE DUMPSTER CUZ IT STINKS LIKE ONE! DON'T GET THIS GAME!"
5,The Greatest Wrestling Game ever,"Finally, Smackdown has come back to PlayStation 2, and boy, does it look good. Smackdown vs. Raw is on the PS2, and the sixth time's the charm.The Smackdown games were godly creations if you were a wrestling fan, but they just got better.Smackdown vs. Raw is the complete package. It has a solid career mode, where all the characters have voice-overs from their respective Superstars (except for you, what you say is STILL captioned). It also has a variety of different matches that dig deep into WWE's history, while still getting the more recently added matches into the picture. Also, if you have an Ethernet modem that can hook up to your PS2, Smackdown vs. Raw has Online capabilities.Overall, Smackdown vs. Raw stretches the greatness of wrestling. I, myself, began watching wrestling again because of Smackdown vs. Raw."
3,HERE COMES THE PAIN is superior,"things the last smackdown! game had that this one doesn't-ability to change roster,ability to show respect or beatdown opponent at the end of the match,season mode gave you more choices,season mode has tag team titles and cruiser weight belt,ability to ask for title shot in season mode,communicate and challenge superstars backstage and wider backstage options while wrestling backstage.THIS smackdown! has voice overs which not only sucks but hardly is as substitute for all the stuff that i mentioned they took out."
1,"This game is so laughable, who wants to play this sh^^ anyways?","Boy, I feel bad for THQ by now by making fools out of themselves & making themselves look bad by releasing a bad videogame that is not loved by many people! These guys are much of a laughing stock now they've decided to release a clowns game instead of wrestling. But who can blame them, I always thought that THQ would make great clowns one day & be a laughing stock to the whole entire f^^^ing world. Oh well, thats typical THQ for you. They're meant to be clowns in the first place anyways."
1,I hate this!,"No old school sh^t, that sucks man. Where the hell is I Quit, Lumberjack, & Casket? Who cares about First Blood, Bra & Panties, TLC, & Parking Lot Brawl! Those 4 matches are a waste of time & they're not even fun neither to play those in. Vince can say whoopppiieee for all I care but know this. Theres a rumor that WWE games will no longer be made for any system anymore. But you know what, who cares. I never liked WWE anyways cause all of their game titles suck. Hopefully the whole damngone company will fall apart & go out of business, that'll be sweet!"
1,Has Been!,"This game is over the hill already & people don't care for this anymore! I mean whats it been, 2 years & now part 2 is out? What the f**k is up with THQ & Vince McMahon? These games are already has beens & nothing less at all! Someday, I mean, SOMEDAY! The WWE game makings will come to an end, TRUST ME!!!!!!"
3,"Fun, but Not the Best","I'm a wrestling fan, but the first WWE Smackdown Vs. Raw is the weakest entry. It has horrible graphics and it isn't very challenging, but I'm still giving it three stars because back in the day I played the game nonstop. The game is somewhat fun."
1,"For this is the bad, not the good!","You'd only hoped it had good features but no more it doesn't after HCTP went through with good feelings! But now, games like this doesn't deserve crap after THQ screwed it up for us like wheres the character creations in season mode that you don't have to play as them and wheres good storylines at? Damn man, I really wanted those things to be in there again for quite some time but not in this game! We will probably never see these features in other wrestling games ever again which is really dopey! I hate this game & I hate THQ too, they suck at making games now!"
5,Best wrestling game!!!!,The best wresling game there is yet smackdown just keeps on improving on everything i can't wait till smack 6 comes out its gunna be Raw
1,"This game sucks, PERIOD!!!!!","Srcew what this guy below me says, this game is a total suck up. Models are stupid, only like 25 guys in this game, gameplay is lousy, season mode is f***ed up, creating a title & ppv is a crappy letdown, & mainly everything!You want good WWE games: Here Comes The Pain, Shut Your Mouth, Just Bring It, & Smackdown vs Raw 2006 will always top this game 1,000,000 times! Also wait for Smackdown vs Raw 2007, a must play!"
1,Only posers would play this game.,"If you're a poser, then this game is for you. Because the CPU mostly poses you all the damn freaking time & don't fight at all. This game isn't wrestling, this is a game for posing only & you seem like a poser, so get this game. This game is called WPE, World Posing Entertainment that I would rather call because they don't hardly put up a fight & crap. All they do is pose like a fagget that they are!"
1,"Anything could be possible, but not with this.","You have to wonder that THQ & Vince McMahon gave up on their video game WWE fans that they've sort of well mostly let them down in one shot by making this game a low rated version with post pone bad reivews. They indeed let the fans down with this crap that had to be released. It was supposed to be originally Smackdown! Word Life which would feature John Cena on the front cover & man that'll been different if they didn't change the title or stupid features in here, dang! But no, they had to do it anyways. TNA kicks more ass anyways, stick with TNA please!"
1,"Hope to WWE that they stop making video games soon, cause I can't take this anymore.","First off, I don't what happened to Vincent McMahon, after all these years with good games until this, this piece of crap had to come along out for this system! If theres one thing that I hate the most is this corny crap disc. No one here likes this game & is a bad rate quality hands down. Go buy Here Comes The Pain & Shut Your Mouth, a double packed gift for you."
1,"WWE FANS GET BROKE WHILE VINCE & THQ GET PAID, GO FIGURE!","LUCKILY FOR ME, I PLAYED THIS AT MY FRIENDS PLACE & BOY DOES THIS GAME ROT. HERE COMES THE PAIN & SVR 2006 ARE GOOD GAMES FOR WWE FANS & MYSELF AS WELL. I CAN'T BELIEVE & IMAGINE THAT VINCE & THQ GET PAID JUST BECAUSE THEY MAID A GAME THAT LET ALL OF THE WWE FANS DOWN, DON'T THEY KNOW THAT? WELL I GUESS THE OLD SAYING GOES ""ITS ALL ABOUT THE MONEY"", YEAH I FIGURE THAT BY NOW!! THQ & VINCE ARE MONEY HUNGRY, THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU WWE FANS. DON'T EVEN TRUST GETTING THESE GAMES FROM MONEY HUNGRY PEOPLE ANYMORE."
1,"If WWE cares about the fans so much, then how come they don't have these things that the fans want?","Really, I don't get it a bit. Its like if Vince & THQ forgot without us, this game would be much worse for them to make. Not only that does the game lacks all the time but it hardly have good rates for this. Just to let y'all know that TNA is having a game soon for the PS3! Looking foward to getting that instead of WWE game crap."
1,"Goodbye SvR, you're history!","Thats exactly what I said and what I say always come true so don't deny what I have to say about that. You don't know whats it like to be in me & my shoes. Not to only that, but to make right decisions like to dump this game into to the dumpster of Vinces *******************!"
1,Good ridences for this s^^t!,"Everytime you go to a match, the CPU always takes advantage of you even if you're on easy mode! That difficlty is not easy, its hard, really hard. I doesn't have standouts & sure as hell doesn't have your type of taste for gameplaying! All this is just another typical sellout game that'll make you waste your money for craps like this! I can't imagine the destruction that Vince McMahon fell to. He completely, thrown this game into flames of hell!"
1,You will not be happy ever again after this!,"I said it correctly didn't I? What I say is always true, this game is not for you & definately not yours to hold your interests really long! Crappy graphics, gameplay, models, creations, build up, and everthing is downright ugly & pointless here! So do get games that'll hype you up, but no this. This game won't hype you up at all!"
1,"Hate this game is an option, nothing else people!","This game that will bring you two things only, hate & stupidity! Thats to name two at least but theres more than hate & stupidity in this game that'll bring out more anger out of your system that you wanted to break it with your clutched fists! Having to know this, but its worth saving your trouble than to cowardly hiding it! But I'll do it anyways by taking my anger out on THQ!"
1,Who in the green hell are these jackasses think they are?,"The game is wack thanks to these jackle asses THQ and McMahon! Vince on the cover looks like he's on drugs or something and the colors are messed up on front cover! Its not even straight up correct! Its mostly red than blue when it should of been between! This game is also a joke to every person in the world here today and trying to make us like we're damngone fools or something! I can't believe Vince & THQ thought they can get rid of the stuff from other past wrestling games & put it like its some kind of side show! Thats Unbelieveable, it really is. I'm tired of baby games, this has have to stop here & now! No more will THQ & VInce gat any respect from me again! Hey THQ & Vince, if you're looking at this review, read this sign language down below! (...)"
1,IT SURE AS HELL BEATS ME!!,"YOU CAN'T EVEN DO A DARN THING IN THIS GAME, NOT EVEN A SCRATCH OR TWO! I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE AN INTERESTED GAME FOR SOMEONE WHO REALLY WANTS TO PLAY WITH, BUT BOY WAS I WRONG. THIS GAME CAN'T EVEN ELECTRIFY ME OR SOMEONE LIKE YOU UP! YOU THOUGHT OTHER PAST WWE GAMES COULDN'T DO IT FOR YOU, BUT THIS ONE IS BY FAR THE WORST GAME OF THE HISTORY TODAY! THE GAME HAS DEFEATED ME SO BAD I CRUSHED IT WITH MY BARE HANDS!"
2,one word divas,now i like the new dirty and clean meter but what were they thinking when they were making that season they potray the divas like slutes but very good lookin slutes and shawn micheals is hareier than a gorilla now the upper part about this game was the divas
1,Not the game I was looking for!,"This game is what I call boring! Not only that, its has no good features, gameplay, creations, or any other sercumstances! The game is full of crap junk & nothing else that is good! If you want a game that'll give you energy & fun, then get HCTP & SYM! Possible that you can get this game and do something else with it, like shove it in [...]"
1,Kick this game right in the ***!,"You don't even know what you'd expect to see in this game! Junk, this game is full of junk! I hate games that are junky and funky! Stupid ass THQ can't ever make anything good like they did with HCTP or SYM! We would probably never see those features never again in the future from the past!"
1,This game is for hipocrites only!,"This game is avaiable only for people who are hipocrites and **** themselves like heck! You not only going to hate this game but, f%%k this game up cause you will I repeat you will go and get your money back as quick as you can say ""got to go goodbye"" like a jackass that you're! So do some good things in favor such as kick THQ and Mr. Vince K. McMahon right in the ****************, and make them hacks go out of business!"
1,Game Ratings.,"Smackdown!

This game is off the chain!Now y'all know the game ratings, enjoy!"
1,Stupid F**king Game!,This game sucks. Vince & THQ sucks too. Shove this game up in Vinces & THQ's candyasses!
1,Worst Of'em All!,"This is the game that says its one of the best to date!!!!! No it isn't!!! Its the worst to date!!!! The gameplay, cutscenes, storymode, create a superstar, create a belt, and most of all, EVERYTHING SUCKS!!!! The Unertaker doesn't complain for a title and he doesn't act like a maniac neither.VINCE, YOU'RE STUPID!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,WWE Smackdown! vs. Raw; as good as GTA: San Andreas,"This game is awesome. The voiceovers are well done. The facial expressions could be better though. I wish you could assign voices to your created superstars, but it is fun neverless. The moves are absolutly fantastic. And the create modes will keep you busy for hours, literaly. Season mode still rocks but I like to make my own PPV which they have brought back. Also you can unlock legends such as Bret Hart, Andre the Giant, and The Rock.There is practilly nothing wrong with this game. Go out and buy it. Don't think, just do it."
4,Nicholas Review,This game is pretty cool. I really like when you can make your own Belt.You can also face other people for their belt online.Their are a few belts but who cares.It costs a lot that sucks.The graphics are amazing.The Rock is my favorite wrestler but you have to unlock him.who cares.Ovarall this game is Great
1,Rated T For Teens?,"More like rated C for Early Childhood in my point of view, which is really true! Don't get this game, its so pointless! This game is for babies only! This game sucks, everything in it and bit of it!"
1,SvR 2006 is a lot better than this phony crap!,"I really do hate this game, its full of lacky all the time. This game has no fun for me at all, and probably not for you either. The game has no comparison to those of SvR 2006, it has no title exhibition like part two does. The story mode in this game is also out to date, but SvR 2006 is a lot better. Also to tell you the truth, this game doesn't ever hype me up like part 2 does! Like that reviewer say, thats not a bad thing, thats a good thing. If only DDP was a legend in that game, haven't seen him on TNA for a while!"
1,DOWN WITH VINCE & THQ!,"VINCE & THQ, YOU GUYS ARE GOING DOWN FOR MAKING A GAME THAT MAKES EVERY PERSON BEATING UP EACH OTHER AND HATING ONE ANOTHER! SO PACK YOUR BAGS AND F^CK OFF OUT OF HERE, DO YOU READ ME PUNKS! GOOD, NOW GET THE HELL OUT OF TOWN OR I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO HAVE Y'ALL STINKFACED!!!!!!!"
1,GET IT OUT OF MY HEAD THAT IS OF THIS GAME!,"HOPE YOU PEOPLE ARE ENJOYING THIS GAME, CAUSE I DON'T! IT ONLY SUCKS & LACKS OF FUN, BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT YOU DUDES AT HOME ARE LOOKING AT THIS REVIEW AND HAVE A SECOND LOOK AT THAT GAME THAT YOU GUYS HAVE! YOU PROBABLY FIGURED IT OUT BY NOW THAT IT HAS NOTHING THAT YOU BARGAINED FOR! YOU ALSO HOPED TO GET RID OF IT AS MUCH AS I ALREADY DID WITH MINE, GOOD MAN, THATS THE SMART IDEA TO DO IT!"
1,NO CLUE WHY!,"THIS GAME HAS EVERYONES MIND THAT THEY SAID WHAT IS SO WRONG WITH THIS GAME AND WHY DOES IT HAVE SO MANY BAD REVIEWS? ITS THAT SIMPLE, THE GAME SUCKS, GET IT? NO GOOD SEASON, ONLY 4 CHAMPIONSHIPS, GAMEPLAY IS LACKY, CREATIONS ARE POINTLESS & PATHETIC LIKE THEIR FACES REMIND ME OF A BAMBOO WITH FAT CHEEKS, AND MOSTLY EVERYTHING IS ***********!! THATS ALL THE ANSWERS I'LL GIVE Y'ALL! YOU WANT MORE ANSWERS, THEN CHECK THE OTHER REVIEWERS WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS TURDDESH MOSH CRAPP!!!!! MAYBE YOU'LL GET BETTER ANSWERS IF THIS DON'T HELP YOUR F^^KED UP HEAD!!!"
1,I'M GLAD I'M POSTING!,"FOR MY REASON, THIS GAME RIGHT HERE IS BORING, SUCKS, LACKING, WASTED, AND MOST IRRITATING GAME I'D EVER PLAYED! YOU DUDES NEED TO START LISTENING TO THESE REVIEWERS THAT ME AND MY CHAPS MADE! THESE POSTS ARE NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS GAME, THEN YOU'LL REALIZE WHO IS RIGHT AND WHO IS WRONG! BUT WE'RE RIGHT FOR OUR SAKE!!!!!"
1,THIS GAME IS KILLING ME! I DON'T WANT TO DIE!,"AH, THIS GAME IS SO HORRIBLE, I CRIED FOR MY MOMMY! THIS GAME MADE ME LIKE A SISSY, MOMMA'S BOY, CRYBABY, AND SO MUCH MORE THAT MADE ME LIKE WEIRDO STUFF! I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY AM I AFRAID OF PEOPLE NOW, WWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"We Rock, But This Game Is Not!","Oh yeah boy! We do rock the set cause this game isn't not what to expect from these hungry gamers up right here in this mug! But what a failure for there first try and made this out of the dump I bet! But no worries, WCW games was always better than WWE games anyways!"
1,"You people want to know what I think about this game, well heres y'alls answer!","This game is sucky and boring and its also lack of y'alls fun time! It has no good features in this game, I'm sorry that Vince let y'all down like that!"
1,"No standouts, good game play, or..... what?","Those reviewers where right about this game, it stinks like ****! Don't get it, this game has negative fun! I'm done here thank you!"
1,"I have seen many games come & go, but this one really needs to go!!","Boring this game is, and partially failed at its pace! You see many games made success but this one is nothing like other good wrestling games from the past WWE gamings! It may look reality but it won't fit your style for long though!"
1,KILL THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! KILL IT!!!! KILL THIS GAME!!!! KILL IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THE REASON WHY THIS GAME DESERVES TO GET KILLED IS BECAUSE ITS DOWNRIGHT BAD, AWFUL, BORING, LAME, STUPID, LUNKHEADED, DUMB, IDIOT, HORRIBLE, AND TO NAME MUCH BAD THINGS ABOUT IT WHICH IS REALLY TRUE! CAUSE YOU CAN NEVER GET NO LOVE FOR THIS GAME AFTER YOU'VE PLAY IT LIKE OVER MORE THAN TRILLION TIMES PER DAY!!!! IF YA KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING THEN YOU SHOULD KILL THIS GAME!!!!! KILL IT!!!!!! KILL THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! KILL IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"1 star or below isn't a really big deal, its just plain sick, thats all!","Hug this game goodbye of use a chainsaw if you have to cause you're looking at WWE's worst games of the world here today! This game is a failure and may not hold your arms forever, and its a total meltdown of lacklust! Enjoy right now, but then you want to get rid of it as possible as you can like hellfire and brimstone as lava!!! Don't even ask if the game is good cause it isn't, but I'll tell you what is really good about this game and I'll admit it! TO WASTE YOUR DAMNGONE MONEY, THATS ALL!!!!"
1,"Option A is to buy this crap like a fool or Option B is, burn this sh*t to hell, yeah Option B' better!","Hell yeah Option B is better than A! The only thing you can find good in this game is your money! Thats the only thing here by trading this sh*t back to the damn store where it rightfully belongs. No way you guys will ever enjoy this crap ever again or again after this crap been played over millions of freaking times a row! Plus to tell y'all the truth, you guys might not last too long playing this sh*t & ending up to take it back to the damn store for your full credit back. This game has nothing here to brighten up your system & its not even worth 10 dollar wages!"
5,Great game YO!,"Well its a great game. the only thing is that in season mode u keep doing the same thing unless u have abelt. And speaking of belts, there is no cruiserweight, tag team, or womens cahmpionship. The voice overs are off the charts,and so is create a belt. the only thing is that it cost money. The new challenges in exhibition mode r fun too. if i had an online thing then id bet that wold be fun too. They put songs in it like in an EA sports game, but most of the songs are cool. Its pretty bad for young kids though, like when u first start season, and ur with torrie wilson, yea if u get the game ull find out what happens.have . it is pretty realistic though. anyway heres some of the roster i cant remember it allA-trainbigshowbatistabooker tcharlie haasrickrandy ortanedgekaneundertakercenaJBLHHHrene dupreegarison cademark jindrakthe dudleysall the divas except for litakurt anglethe rock( as a legend)ric flairAND MANY MORE"
1,"Halla Lo Ya, This Game Is Gonna Burn In Hell!","Oh yeah, Thank God! This game has been created by the devils and it never had tempted me to play it because I knew it was awful so I spit the disc and threw into the face of Vince, and he liked it (...)"
1,HATE THIS GAME I REALLY DO!,"GO GET THIS GAME & THROW IT DOWN THE RIVER, IT WON'T HOLD YOUR INTERESTS ANY LONGER!!"
1,Please make this game go away!,"This game that I wished should never existed, I mean! Who cares about The Rock anymore anyways in this game after his big ass butt soldout to make movies and he's not really a lagend and he doesn't deserve to be in the hall of fame for the future! Plus the A.I. computers in this game are dumblunkheaded when they play as a created superstar! They only pose at each other & don't even fight! Whats this, a dancing party show or something like a fasion show? No its not, so you CPU's either wrestle or leave for a posing show! They also go out & in the ring about a couple of times like they're retarted or something! Theres so much more for this game that is stupid and ack!!! If I were you people, I would say screw them pigs, Vincent & THQ!"
1,Waste Of Cash!!!!!!!,"I can't believe I spent 55.00 bucks for this lackluster game that is so-called enjoyable for your funtime, go figure yeah right! Enjayoble funtime my ass!!! I'm glad I took this garbage back to K-Mart & got my 55.00 bucks back! Theres a lot of things that are screwed up in this game like for this!!!!!! As you put two CPU fighters as created superstars!! They will only taunt each other rather than put up a fight with one another! Plus they always leave the ring and enter back in like they're doing an award show entrance or something!!! Plus the seasonmode and cutscenes are downright pathetic, and it has no choosing for this one mostly!!! Other thing in this game are screwed up and you want to find out more, THIS IS YOUR GAME THEN!!!!!"
1,Hello Folks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"My name is Doodleberry, and I live at the hills if you know where that is. I didn't here such a video game called SvR until a friend of mine played it once! He said this game was improved with real life players, but he also said the game is not for you to play with. I was shock to hear him say that but he told me the rest! The gameplay was rotten, and the creations were dope! The storymode and cutscenes were sorry as hell! Also, the whole game was out of date and it wasn't a good game to play and so I believed him for telling me this! This my friends is based on a true story, and thats why many people seen it on E! True Hollywood Story! Even if its not from Hollywood anyways, but thats the truth!"
1,"This game is junk I tell you, JUNK!",Yes it is junk and don't say I told you so! You won't find anything entertaining here and futhermore no fun either!
1,How I Loathe This Game!,"Couldn't be any worse unless you'd played it like I had in the past! This game is trust me, a downright failure like everyone else says here!"
1,Hell With This Video Game Man!!,"Forget this game, its not even fun at all once you play it and won't look back again for it! No more do I trust Vince & THQ after they made this game like hell! TNA is much more better than WWE, and they don't sell out their companions! So get this game & shove up in Vincent's ass!"
1,"Go away, we're closed!","Just say no to SvR, and go away! Its like every game in gamecube like this one does, it sucks ***! I mean, screw those pigs Vincent McMahon & THQ! Who the hell cares if they make sorryass videogames anyways! This game definately is straight up fu!ked up! No way that I kept this s^it for long after I'd played it like hell and brimstone!! Like I said, screw those pigs THQ and Vince! They don't deserve to make money after they screwed up the gameplay, story, titles, character creations, belt creations, ppv creations, and futhermore! You people can call this game fun, but we call it just plain ******** and thats what we always call it! SCREW THEM PIGS!"
1,Kick this games ass!,"This game deserves to be back into the box and into the a-hole of THQ & Vince!! That's a perfect package their, and it should be forever! This game could of been improved and sell best, but instead it had to be junk like other shi^^y games! I, who don't really give a damn about this game, Vincent or and THQ, [...]"
1,"JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT WRESTLEMANIA 21 WAS THE WORSE GAME OF ALL TIME, THIS RIGHT HERE COMBINES WITH W-21!","THE ONLY REASON WHY I EVEN GOT HOOKED ON THIS GAME IS WHEN I'VE BOUGHT SMACKDOWN! HERE COMES THE PAIN! THEN WHEN I'VE LEARNED ABOUT THIS GAME, THE COMMERCIAL SHOWS THAT IT HAS NICE ARENA DISPLAYS BUT THE GAME ENTIRELY SUCKS ASS! THIS GAME THAT I GOT RID OF QUICK AS YOU CAN SAY HOW DO YOU DO! BUT THE OLD SAYING THAT CURIOSITY KILLED THE CAT, WWE KILLED THE WWE FANS! THATS A DISPLAY OF BAD INFLUENCES OF WWE GAMERS & LIKE, DAMN! THIS GAME SHOWS HOW BAD IT IS BY PLAYING IT LIKE HELL AND QUICK BACK AS YOU WOULD SAY WHIPLASH! GAMES LIKE THESE DESERVES TO BE IN THE LAVA JOINTS, AND IF YOU ASK ME, I DON'T EXACTLY REMEMBER HOW I EVEN GOT THIS TRASH SH^T. BUT I TELL Y'ALL WHAT, THESE DAYS OF WWE GAMES, WILL COME TO AN END, BELIEVE THAT!!!!!"
1,This Game Reeks Big Time!,"You people can never understand what is right and what is wrong! Well this is wrong! This game right here is for kids, babies, and little children. None of theses are mature adults, teens, or adults! No way, these games like SvR is a disgrace of the nation if you ask me! Those baffoons THQ & Vincent Krappy McMahon don't know how to make squat!!!!! No siree, just the same crap like Wrestlemania 21. I don't even care which of these games are worse than the other, so leave that to the pigs!"
1,JBL IS MACHO IN THIS GAME? WHAT THE F*CK IS WRONG WITH YOO THQ?,"I'LL TELL Y'ALL NOW, STRAIGHT UP HERE! JBL DOESN'T HAVE ANY MUSCLES ANYMORE & YOU WOULD BELIEVE ME!!! HE MAY LOOK MACHO IN THE GAME BUT NOT ON LIVE TELEVISION!!!!!! THAT DUDE HARDLY EVER WORKS OUT NO MOE! I'M IN WAY BETTER SHAPE THAN JBL AND I'M NOT EVEN A GIANT EITHER!! HE CAN'T EVEN LIFT THE BIG SHOW & ALSO SHOULD OF BEEN CONSIDERED AS A LIGHT-HEAVYWEIGHT!"
1,"They Seen, They Came, They Failed!","You people thought I might say they seen, they came, & they conquered. But thats not the case people, SORRY!!! What you PEOPLE need to REALIZE is that this GAME here is full of TARNISH especially for y'alls poor SYSTEM that is in DANGER on STAKE! THATS right, A DOWN right FAILURE dudes! NO storylines that are good or better than the previous WWE GAMES!! Neither is it not near enough like SvR 2006! GO figure MAN!!!!!!! THIS GAME IS full of HORSE MANUER AS I played IT!! The graphics aren't too very unique at ALL! The entire game is HELL FROZEN OVER!!!! No standouts to this lackluster at all!! No no, NO!!! NOT ALL AT PAL!!!!!!! This game is for TODDLERS ONLY, not for ADULTS, so stay AWAY, NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Fun? I don't think so!,"Fun game huh? Yeah, I heard that one before! They always say smartass, becareful what you'd wish for! This game is something that makes you want to puke on! Cuz I did with mine! If you have a chance at it instead of puking it. Go wipe your *********** on it while you still have a chance! It is worth it!"
1,Know Your Role You Bumbling Baffoons!,"First off, Know Your Role! is way better than this piece of corny crappy shi*! You can challenge championships in every way and the ppvs along with 4-player story/season mode! But here, you can't do that, its so pointless & lunkheaded! No 4-player season or title bout matches! Thats why past games are better than new ones! I sold this for 60.00 bucks and them people fall for it! You people would do the same if y'all were me! So do it then, don't just stand there! Sell this *hit if you have to!"
1,"Down with THQ, Vince, & the WWE!","We are on strike because we wanted to put an end to Vince's shurades once we form an angry mob on this site! THQ, you guys are disgracing us with your fraud game you've made & should be arrested for your actions with this release. As for you Vince, not only you'll go out of business. But will make sure will shove every of this game copy's right down in your a**!"
1,"Cough. Oops, sorry!","I had suffered a cold a week ago after I bought this game & after all that trouble it gave me, I decided to return it into its rightfully place. Next day, my illness was gone, vanished, & I was healthy again after I got rid of that (...) game, yay!"
1,Pain.,"Its like ouch, get this pain off me! This is the pain my friends. Games like this only gives you pain like I received from this crap. I hated this game that it gave me a big booboo, wwwwwaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!!!!"
5,Play it a lot,"Smack down vs raw, its a good game but the story gets boring at the benging. But if you play for a long time its gets good. The superstars are not Bad but no paul London, or Doug and Danny or stone cold. A lot of matchs"
4,okay...,This game is just like all the other wwe titles but just a little polished. The graphics have improved as has the general wrestling but some qualities such as the backstage areas have been lost. On the whole this is still another good wrestling title but needs a little more. The fun in wrestler creation still remains with more moves where alot have to be unlocked through season mode and by completing challenges which in my opinion is not a great asset to the game.
3,"For Some Reason, It Is Good, But Not Great","This game is loads of fun but for some reason it didn't seem as good as promised. The games season mode was more enhanced in graphics but the season seemed much shorter because it was set at a faster pace. The voices of the wrestlers is very well done, that i will give credit to. Controls remain the same from Here Comes The Pain, which is a relief, i know some miss the original controls from Shut Your Mouth, that L2 button of mine is about to break because of these games. The different camera angle during matches is a relief, i was getting sick of the old angle that faced the entrance way, now it is set where the T.V. camera is originally located.Overall, some enhancments save it, but the season mode could have been way better, but that didn't stop this game from selling. The highest selling wrestling game of all-time, 2 million sold in the U.S. and is still selling, great job WWE."
4,UGH!,"The thing with this game is that it seems rushed. The graphics are the best on the ps2 console but not the most important thing about games. You see the story mode in this game is ridiculuos. I would really advise anyone thinking of buying this game to make it into a week rental. If by now you dont have the game just forget that it exists. Wait till the next game comes out and then buy it. And if your into the online play, it's not worth it. Online play isn't what you would expect."
4,Raw vs. Smackdown,"The game is very enjoyable and has all the things neccessary to keep you entertained. The biggest downfall of the game is the weak Season Mode that is the same over and over again with each superstar you choose. They have you going through three sepaerate fights over the divas over a course of a year, and then you get one title shot. If your character is created, it takes forever to build up your points high enough to win, and when you start to do so, the story doesn't change anyway! Overall great game I just hope that they work on more options on the career mode. They need to start worrying about that more than how many different eye brow options I have for my created Wrestler."
1,Place this game underneith the McMahon family's ***************!,"After picking fights with HBK & Cena, I had enough of the McMahons, Vince Mostly that snake perv! They made this game to be floppy & crappy like the s^^t ran home or something like that in a very different statement. But you know what, WWE SUCKS!!"
1,Pain in the ass if I should say so!,"That includes in this messed up game that everyone calls it the great. Well, not to me it isn't & surely not the best for hall of fame games as well. Number 1, the game sucks. Number two, shove this game up in vinces d^^^ if you have to, I would."
1,"Just like D-Generation X would say, suck it!","Those days are gone now & even crap like this exists now, which is really dope! I have no clue on earth how Vince & THQ would put out something that has no loving from the fans of WWE & don't have a clue why they would unleash this crap from the ass of Vince McMahon! I would recommentd getting Here Comes The Pain or the stepped uped Smackdown! vs Raw 2006! Those two are one of the best games ever, but not this low life scum that you call it a playable great game, its lousy as that!"
1,SvR is not for me or y'all!,"If you say it is, then I don't know whats wrong with y'all people. All I know is that Vince & THQ always try to trick people especially when it comes to stealing money from us people if you know what I'm talking about. Don't mistake about, its just the fact that you dudes don't get what you'd expecting. This game seem to be rushed & quickly made with non-experienced. No way would this game be in my collection & hell no it'll won't end up in a hall of fame. So get part 2 if you have to, much more better than this."
2,HOW IS IT SMACKDOWN?,"How can smackdown's next title be good.True the mechanics and controls,new addons,belts,ppv,s and graphics are excellent,but there is no GOLDBERG,AUSTIN,EUGENE,BROCK,REGAL,HULK HOGAN,MICK FOLEY,KEVIN NASH.......i MEAN HALF OF THESE GUYS ARE LEGENDS AND they were the best in the WWE."
1,Bad start. Buy the later smackdown vs raw games,This game is really boring. theres nothing new. no new game modes. no new roster. nothing. dont buy!! stick with the very old smackdown games or get smackdown vs raw 2007 that games the best
3,Pretty Fun Game,"I enjoyed playing the game for about the first month, but when I try to load certain wrestlers or events the games freezes. That stinks!!!"
2,Mediocre compilation,"I was very disappointed to find that the version of Penthouse and Pavement on this collection is the 4:04 edited single version with a horrible edit of the intro. The original version is something like 6:00, so there's nearly two minutes missing from the song. Otherwise, most of the must-have Heaven 17 songs are here, but all the shortest versions."
2,"Uccchhh, they called these three ""the talented ones""!","I ask that because the male lead singer of one of the '80's best contributers to the synth-pop genre, Human League, said that on the audio liner notes portion of their ""Very Best Of"" album. The three former members of this group left in the early '80's and formed their own music group, being Heaven 17. I'm sorry to say that, having listened to this album one night this past week, I find the CD's entire song selection, in my opinion, to leave a whole lot to be desired. I don't even remember any of the titles, and I can't understand how any of these purely mediocre tunes ever could have been a hit in any country. That is essentially it for me, the reason I didn't give this album only one star is that, thankfully, it's not the absolute worst I've ever heard. I don't think that my taste in music could possibly be that bad, I've got taste, decency, dignity, integrity, and a reputation to uphold after all!"
4,"Clear reasoning, chaotic structure, engaging book.","Santillana and Dechend have made a compelling case for the role that myth plays in describing and capturing complex astronomical observations. I read it with great interest and engagement, but could have used better laid connections between the appendices and the main text. I am reasonably well-read in myth, but I still found myself flipping rather frantically back and forth and searching for online references so that I better understood what was being said.The rambling nature of the essay (cheerfully admitted by the authors in the preface) serves as both a strength and a flaw. It may have been easier to read if written in a more orderly way. However, the elliptical prose made it quite engaging, and eventually invited the reader to have a dialogue with the text in a way that I quite enjoyed.Still, I hope that in the next edition, some editors take mercy on the readers and connect the dots between the essays and appendices."
2,Lacked Structure,There more than enough interesting material here for a good book. Reading this is like following a dozen rabbit trails without a guide. Even knowing the point of the essay before-hand only carried me so far. These authors needed more interested editors.
3,Leaves Much To Be Desired,"If one is looking for documented back-up that the ancients of pre-history were aware of the precession of the equinoxes, and that this knowledge is embedded and encoded in world mythology, Hamlet's Mill does the job. However-- the authors seem to be of the notion that the primary purpose and interpretation of myth is to convey astronomical information. In reality, myths are the residue of ancient mystical teachings and of real events and beings of pre-history. The fairy tales of Europe, the Hindu scriptures, Sufi tales of the mystic east, Greek and Egyptian mythology all are rooted in this ancient essence, to which the authors give short shrift. If one is seeking the truth that lies behind myth--aside from the precession thing- seek elsewhere than in Hamlet's Mill, which takes a very worldly, mundane view."
3,Watch stops periodically,Watch is attractive. It stops sometimes when not being worn. Does not seem like a battery problem as it runs when worn!!
5,Great Intro!,"Though it's a couple of years old, this is a great intro to the material of Lari White. Yes, she is more than just an actress, the artist who gave Tom Hanks hope in ""Cast Away"". My favorite cuts: ""Lay Around and Love on You"" and ""What a Woman Wants"". Listen and enjoy!"
5,Buy It,"Although a bit dated, this is a great collection of songs. Lari has a wonderful voice, a passionate delivery, and this is a CD that you'll enjoy for years."
2,just a toy,"I purchased this wheel for the Nascar 06 game. Right out of the box I had problems. First, Play station 2 does not recognize this wheel when you try to configure it. You have to change the Game controller configuration to # 2 for it to work properly.Second, The vibration in the wheel when you hit the wall or crash is minimal. Almost not noticable.Third, even on the high sensativity level for the wheel it still does not keep up with the steering wheel on the screen.At best this is just a toy, If you're serious about your driving games spend the extra money for a good wheel."
2,"Read other Pynchon, please.","This is his first book, he was young, mid-twenties. Of course, it's pynchon, so it's STILL a great book, but all his others are more evolved and thought out. Here, he starts dealing with his classic themes: obscure place, allegories, fractured characters, dark humor, cyclical time, relative space, etc.The problem is, it's confusing in a naive, over-zealous way. (Unlike gravity's rainbow or mason & dixon, which are confusing in an ultra-rational way) Pynchon's technique in all his novels is to create an experience that becomes a consciousness through reading, instead of linearly narrating a story, he gives us impressions only, and a truth evolves. The truth becomes part of the reader, not just part of the pages or the author. It's like pynchon lets the reading write the novel as the novel goes along.Pynchon is a genius, he will change your life. Just don't start with V."
1,"flippant, nihilistic, turgid, self-important","All of Pynchon's books are hard to read because of his twisted syntax, and this is no different.The story is about uninteresting, uninvolving people.The story seems to exhibit a fair amount of misogyny, since there is a climatic scene where the herione is shown to have undergone a number of horrible body modifications due to her greed and promiscuity. Futhermore, she is shown to be attacked, robbed, and fatally wounded by a group of street urchins while the hero looks on without acting to come to her aid. I found this to be very sickening.The rest of the book is very smug and arrogant too, in my opinion. I've put a lot of effort into trying to read Pynchon over the years, and I feel it has been entirely wasted. I am very bitter about this, I freely admit."
1,?????????,"Ridiculously convoluted tale held together by the most tenuous coincidences. As for the ""message"" of the book: you tell me. Hard going and ultimately unrewarding. Well done Mr Pynchon you've got away with it again! Did I hear anyone mention The Emperor's New Clothes???"
5,"""Look in side this book!""...it's Kilroy","It's funny, but you'll need a pycnometer to measure this steganography, unless you're a secret agnent or a schmehl."
5,Fascinating,"It's hard to easily describe this book. But fascinating is a start. I guess one approach to this book is to try and make total sense of all the historical references and allusions. Another is to just hop on and enjoy the ride. I chose the later, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I think I even picked up on some of the themes too. V. seems to be often concerend with the animate vs. the inanimate. The characters seem to evoke a peculiar relationship with the inanimate (like when Profane tries to have sex on the pool table and suddenly the lights go out). That's the approach I was taking during the novel. There are, however, many approaches. There is also a lot of obvious experimentation with narrarive styles here too. Overall, the search for V. is quite secondary to simply enjoying the book. I guess I should read GR now. I'm looking forwad to it."
4,Down in the sewers,"V. is like some weird, half dreamed dispatch from a mind that is hermetically sealed off from the world. It's a book that seems to revolve more around a specific set of images and motifs, clocks, yo-yo's inanimate objects, Malta, espionage, etc. than around a set of characters, though the characters are often compelling and weirdly poetic in their own ways. It's hard to believe that this book is almost 50 years old. The way it tries to tie together so many odd, all but forgotten historical threads and to make you puzzle over them feels incredibly ahead of its time. Which probably goes to show just how widely influential Pynchon actually is. I feel like you could actually move into this book and drown in it."
2,Read almost anything else by him,"As somebody who holds Gravity's Rainbow in the highest regard - and no, I'm not in higher education - I have to admit that this one defeated me. It had some good bits up until the point where I gave up, including a stomach-churning description of a nose job, but compared to Pynchon's later stuff (and indeed earlier stories) the prose is clunky and unwieldy. Significance is all over the place. It's not especially funny. If it were by anybody else, I might have rated it higher, but I don't think (and neither, apparently, does the author) that it's up to his highest standard. One day I'll finish it, but if you're a Pynchon beginner, I wouldn't start here."
3,"Try, trying, tried.....","This was my third attempt at reading V and finishing a novel that ""everyone""calls a classic. I got about a third done and I still didn't care at all aboutany of the characters nor did I intend to spend hours of my lifetime trying again.So I put it down for the last time."
4,Flawed and funny,"To borrow a Tolkien-ism, I have a cordial dislike for symbolism. Put another way, I don't mind it being there, but like fins on a car, I don't want it to get in the way of driving the thing with the top down and the wind whistling through my hair.And ""V"" is like that -- a breezy and high-spirited ride, symbolism or no. That's why I think all the grad-student rhapsodizing in the collected reviews here are a disservice to Tommy P.'s ""V"".Sure, there is symbolism galore in ""V,"" but it is nowhere near as goose-steppingly intrusive as you would guess from what you read here. Matter of fact, the book, while containing ample evidence of its author's youth, is fast, funny, and accessible.Read the book. Give it a chance and it will catch you; it will move you in strange and spooky ways. Years after reading ""V"" I still remember scenes like the wreckage of a Greek island, or Pynchon's unerringly funny slapstick, often set around one his many Profane dopplegangers.Read ""V""."
5,A Veritable Maze of Experience,"It's Pynchon, so what can I say? This novel deserves V stars. Its narrative is woven from the finest tapestry, and so cleverly worded besides. Ever tap out the syllables ""Benny Profane"" on a table top? Do it a few times, and listen to the rhythm. Ever listen to the opening figure in the first movement of Ludwig Van's 5th? Of course you have. Dot-dot-dot dash. The V symbol shows up periodically on the world canvas--depends a lot on how you frame your experience, of course. Take the underground resistance in Denmark for a decent example. And I also recall in a previous life I flashed the V with my fingers and said ""peace."" There are other implications as well--much too diabolical to explore those in this forum."
2,GREAT ~~~ but readable - no,"Brilliant writer, amazing complexity, symbolism galore. Call me crazy, isn't readability supposed to enter in here somewhere. Its just not an enjoyable read. Having read other great 20th century writers like Mahfouz, Kawabata, Marquez, Saramago, Hesse(to name a few), I find this book unreadable and fragmented. I get that Pynchon is brilliant but in my opinion his brilliance is gained at the sacrifice of simple good story telling. Can't there be a marriage of the two? Maybe it captures the essence of 20 th century apathy, but I found myself not caring a lick what happened to any of the characters or the plot. Ultimately causing me to set the book aside."
3,If you're a Pynchon fan already...,"If you're a Pynchon fan already, then you will probably enjoy this book.If you're not or if you've never read him, you're better off starting with another book.Personally, for me this was the most difficult Pynchon novel to get through.If you like the vagueness and dark conspiracy side of Pynchon's style, then you may enjoy this even more than Gravity's Rainbow. If you're expecting the humor of Vineland or Mason and Dixon, you may be disappointed."
3,l'art pour l'art,If you read it after Gravity's Rainbow you might be dissapointed if before it's good reading stuff but a little bit boring compared to other Pynchon books.
3,Please Explain,"Although I enjoyed some parts of this book, in the end, I felt robbed.I read patiently expecting a breakthrough of some sort, but it never came.I waited for everything to make sense in the end, but it never did.Please help."
2,"Beautifully written, but who cares?","On almost every page I encountered passages of beautiful, witty, amazingly written prose. But, after about 200 pages, I just couldn't care less about any of the characters, or what happened to them. I am a well-educated person and have read most of the classic ""western canon"". I appreciate many ""modern"" authors like Marquez, Roth, Walker Percy, Bellow, Updike, Joseph Heller, etc. But I find that my life is too short to persevere with Mr. Pynchon when I neither like or dislike the characters and couldn't care less what happens to them. Based on my experience with this book I have shied away from Delillo since they are always compared similarly. All you guys who believe Pynchon is a great 20th century author can have him."
2,I don't get it,"Reading V I found myself thinking 'Who's Pynchon writing to?' Then I'd realize I'd been thinking about what's for dinner instead of being involved in the story.The guy's certainly not writing to me.Pages would pass when I'd discover a new character was introduced somewhere back in the chaos.I guess this stuff is over my head.I'm not being daft. I'd even give it another shot but if this is Pynchon's 'accessible' stuff, I'm in trouble."
1,Bad,Small characters that stand for too-big ideas. Women are diminished into bestial beings that are vessels for sex. The plot putters out and the many tangents stop being interesting after one realizes their marginal connections are nonsensical.
1,Good Fireplace Book,"This is a great book to read by the fireplace. After about thirty pages you can conveniently toss it IN the fireplace! This is the most boring, disorganized, pointless book I have ever read. I read it because it was recommended by Stephen King. If you want a good book, I would recommend looking elsewhere."
5,A GREATcombination of songs from an EXCELLENT songwriter.,"Guy Clark is definitely one of the best songwriters ever. There is not a bad song from this artist. His music will take you back to a time when life was simple and good. Popular songs which are performed by the original artist are the best. Even his relatively unknown songs are very good. Guy Clark's voice and style will leave you searching for more of his music. ""The Essential Guy Clark"" is just as it says. Essential."
2,Ho Hum for me,"I can see where some people would like this CD but for me it just didn't cut it. Didn't click with me at all, except for ""Let Him Roll"", which is the reason I bought the CD. Can't put my finger on it exactly. I'm very ""classic country"" and somehow this didn't appeal to that thread in me. I like gritty, but I also love melody and this cd somehow missed it on combining the two. Usually Guy is right on with combining those elements but maybe this was more grit and not enough melody for my taste. Actually passed it on to my son."
2,Looking for one cut and found it.,"I was looking for one song: Texas 1947, and found it on this CD. I'm totally satisfied with the song, thus the CD was worth it for me. Unfortunately, nothing else in the collection impressed me much. It's a matter of taste I'm sure. Some folks will love it. Clark is a little too rough or edgy for my taste. I was put off by the roughness, which, as far as I'm concerned is an awkward attempt at philosophical statement, and which overwhelmed his obvious talent."
4,Saved from the Flammes,"Precious early films which are part of the History of Film making. Being french myself the french movies included in this wonderful selection take an even greater interest. It is a miracle those important works were so well restored & preserved for posterity. It is a must for everybody interested in the History of Movie making.It was sent to me excellently packaged , the price is reasonable for such an important collection."
4,The bugs is still out there.,"I've gone thru most of the samples quote in the book. What I had found were the bugs are still out there. I can crashed Solaris 2.6 and 7 easily as an innocent user without any admin right.There I don't agree with that these patches are long ago fixed. No they are not.So whoever need to support Unix should read this book and try to apply the examples to their Unix system. (Of course, not the production one.)"
1,critics,"A command line interface can be frustrating to those with poor attention to detail and a tendency to want to be spoon fed instead of educated. UNIX zealots are to Windoze zealots what CART racing mechanics are to bus passengers.This book was funny, but not to be taken seriously. I put it on the same level as ""The Simpsons"" only not as funny.Use UNIX if you love the nuts & bolts of computing. Use Windoze if you have such low self esteem as to believe that you need someone to think for you. Use Mac if you...well I can't think of a good reason to use Mac."
1,One of the Worst Yu-Gi-Oh! Games Ever!,I cant believe it I mean why would they make this like chess I mean W T F Konami. If you guys like Yu-Gi-Oh! Buy The Card games instead of this (...).
1,Terrible game,This game is so so boring. The graphics was not that great. The game is nothing like the TV series.I wouldn't waste my money on this game.
5,I want this game!,I think it would be really cool to see capsule monsters. what are they? I wonder what cards are in the game case. If you like yu-gi-oh then you should buy this game. This game rocks!!!!!
3,Not as good as I wanted it to be,"This book is funny and sweet and definitely worth a read, but I couldn't like it as much as I wanted to. The plot is thin and the setting so fantastical it's almost alienating. It winds up being a colorful fairy tale, but if you're looking for something that speaks to the experience of gay teenagers, look elsewhere."
3,good but not genius,"This is a thoroughly enjoyable, well-written book. However, it is not the work of genius that other reviewers seem to think it is. It is, in essence, an example of light, almost series romance fiction with gay characters. Which is, perhaps, groundbreaking in its way, but great literature it isn't."
2,Average book,"It appears that the author, who apparently works in publishing, found a niche to fill within the YA market, and went for it. While it certainly not even nearly ""genius"" much less in the realm of great YA literature, it isn't awful. The sad thing is that it is actually a very mediocre book-- it is just that the subject matter-- a gay teen novel not going into over kill on the angst element-- hasn't yet been exploited, so the book, on first look, seems to be more than it is. But the writing is very middle of the road, as is the naive and slightly silly 'optimism' presented here. The book is sadly, in the end, a very mediocre piece of literature. It is a lesson in that mediocrity can be masked by the right packaging, topics of shock, hype or marketing hook."
2,lighthearted snooze,"The immediate feel to this book is warmth and joy. You love all the fun, interesting characters and how life is grand. Then after about 50 pages, that wears off. The remainder is boy loves boy drivel for about 150 pages that borders on boring. Though nice to see an optimistic gay teen novel, this one was hard to finish."
2,Not Appropriate,"The setting is a fantasy world where everyone in the high school is 100% accepting of gayness. One of the characters is a drag queen football star, for instance. However, except for a brief kiss, there is absolutely no sex. As an adult, this book was pretty boring. But I kept thinking about a gay teenager reading this and how upsetting it would be. There's no emotional truth: the kids don't want for money; they're all artistic; they speak like adults; they listen with deep empathy over herbal tea. I don't know any teens like this and it breaks my heart to imagine a gay teen reading this balderdash while all his girlfriends are going sex crazy over the Twilight books. Straight girls get sex hungry vampires and gay boys get, what, dinner and a movie?This is too light to be of interest to adults and too devoid of truth or sex to be of interest to teens.I would recommend Boys on the Rock instead."
1,PU-Lease,"I could not stand this book.I was hoping for a deep introspective read about the struggles that gay teens go through. No such luck--it was a meaningless, not even faintly enjoyable bit of fluff. The gay paradise-type world that Levithan creates isn't cute or funny. It's just annoying.And so is the rest of the book.Why is it that GLBT novels for teens are so focused on confronting the issue of HOMOSEXUALITY that they forget the other essential elements of good fiction--namely plot and at least semi likable,well-developed characters?Oh, and good writing would be nice too.Boy Meets Boy has none of these.Don't bother."
1,A Fantasy Novel That Pretends to be Real,"If I wanted to read a total fantasy novel, I would pick up another author. The story, the setting, the plot, the characters...everything is just so unreal it is hard to enjoy the story. And the ending...it just happens as if the author met his word count and closed his computer. With all the great reviews, I thought I would spend more than I usually would on a Kindle book. I was completely disappointed in my purchase."
3,A Little Too Perfect,"I couldn't really stand this book because of how ""perfect"" their little world is. It seemed like something straight out of a cartoon and at times it just seemed like the author pulled the whole story out of his a** in just a few days. Now that being said it was kinda cute and a bit entertaining but like most gay teen books I've read focusses so much on relationships that I got bored.It's different. Unique. And sickeningly sweet."
4,LGBT Teen Fiction Keeps Getting Better,"Working for an LGBT youth group, I've read 'em all! And up until recently LGBT teen fiction was filled with drugs, suicide, and despair. Thank goodness there are now authors out there who know that today's youth aren't all suffering like they did. Geography Club was the first book that was well written to break this mold, but now there's Boy Meets Boy. I liken BMB to a teen's version of the hit movie, Big Eden, where we all know its not real, but its nice to escape to another world. In Levithan's world being gay is just another part of who we are, and the only thing unusual about the trans football star is that she fills the school halls with drama...not so unusual on second thought.This book is hard to put down, and while there aren't any big surprises, its well written and a nice story. The characters weren't deep but were certainly deep enough to make you care about them, and yes I even cried once or twice. Fun cover, fun story, fun read."
4,good book,eally good book about accepting and being yourself .gay youth struggling should read this book . funny . sad and very interesting
4,Robin Harris Comedy,"Some vulgarity, however it's very funny! Robin Harris has always been funny to me> This cd brought back lots of funny memories!!!"
3,Robin Harris Story,This DVD was OK if u like Robin Harris. It has earlier footages when he got started with his career. He was one of the funniest comedians of all times.
3,Robin Harris..What happened..,"I review this video and it didn't give a full show of his comedy. I enjoyed the snippets, but I thought I would get more for my money. Robin was a great comedian and this video don't show you enough of the real Robin Harris."
1,The Robin Harris Story,I still have not received the DVD from the seller!!! I ordered it a whole month ago.
4,Why only four stars?,"I agree with the former reviewer: fantastic performances of fantastic works. However, I warn the potential buyer that the dynamic level of this CD is too low, as if the listener was placed outside the concert room by the sound technicians. That is especially evident (and lamentable) in the ""Aria"". The music and performances are wonderful, and I would surely buy this CD again if it were remastered to a proper dynamic level."
2,Too Small to hold most spatulas and tall spoons,"The pictures on Amazon are somewhat misleading in terms of it's size. It is smaller than most others of this type and many spatulas don't fit and fall off: and any long handled spoon is precarious in it. Also, one weld joint broke a couple of months after using it. It still hangs together and works."
5,Great for meal prep time.,I wa shopping for a single one to start and stumbled across this one. Great idea because you are usually cooking more than one item at a time.
2,The chrome finish is rough on both uprights.,"I am going to have to send this back. The chrome finish won't hold up over time and will begin rusting in short order. Otherwise, I like the product/concept and was looking forward to adding it to our kitchen operation here at our home."
5,Really useful,"I used to have the single spoon rest but the china bowl broke during washing and when I looked to replace it, this was all I could find. And it is doubly useful. I am often stirring two things at a time and can rest both spoons. I also use the little bowls for various treats for my child and tiny dog."
4,Good for soap scrubbers too,"I use this for the dish washing wands at my kitchen sink. They drip down into the cup after use instead of all over the sink. Perfect size; I use one side for the plain sponge wand and the other side for the scrubbing wand. Nice and neat. I would give it 5 stars except that after a year I'm noticing a little bit of rust on the bottom. But they're near the sink and getting wet a lot, so this may not happen if you're using it as a spoon rest."
2,A real disappointment,"I purchased this for my daughter's Human Anatomy class, thinking that it would assist her with her dissection. She didn't even use it after opening it to check information. She stuck with her Gray's Anatomy (Student's edition). Unless you just really like long, drawn-out explanations, this is not the text for you."
4,Clemente's Anatomy Disector,La portada del libro se desprende facilmente puesto que esta montada en argollas. Por lo demas su contenido es muy bueno.
1,after the dark (dark angel),"If you are a fan of Dark Angel, you will probably be very disappointed by the ending of this book. I was very upset that a major theme of the second season of the Dark Angel TV series was treated as an afterthought and casually disposed of. It also has a glaring astronomical mistake (which sadly I cant go into detail since it may be a spoiler and thus contrary to the review guidelines)."
4,Finshing up the series nicly,I have to say that I really enjoyed this book. It did a really nice job of finishing the series of Dark Angel and all the things we didn't get to see. I could actually picture what happened in this Novel really happening in the series. So I would highly recommend this Novel if your looking for closure for the short run series of Dark Angel which in my personal opinion second season was much better then the first so in true second season fashion this book takes us into the Dark Angel world and its a really fun ride.Devin
3,after the dark,"Again, this (the third and final) book provides yet another good chapter for what would have been another good episode. It would have made a good ""movie"" or even series finale if it had the chance. This book solves the Max-Logan virus issue, defeats the conclave (the snake-cult), gets rid of Ames White, and brings back Lydecker (who went missing in early season two). Just as with ""Skin Game"", I read the entire book in less than a week, which tells myself that I pretty much enjoyed it and was engaged in the story. It provides closure to Max & Logan's problems, past and present, and to most of the other questions that stuck around at the end of the television series. I know some people consider these books to be a glorified ""fan fiction"" but I'm just glad that I didn't have to make the end up on my own. The book has its flaws but I think Collins did a fine job of wrapping up the saga. It's an easy read, not too complicated, but not completely cheesy."
4,Dark angel rules!!!,The tv series was cancelled and left many questions unanswered so I think it`s good to have a closure. I liked it.
4,Dark Angel Fans Will Like This,"I don't quite understand why people are saying the ending is anti-climactic, I think he was just trying to finish out the story. If you like the show and you don't mind reading, you will like the books."
3,Dark Angel - After the Dark review,"It was great to find a book that continued the Dark Angel saga and explained the Breeding Cult and followed-up on the relationship between Max and Logan. However, I would have liked more details on the transgenetics and Max's interesting melting pot of friends.The story mostly focuses on Max's genetic purpose and the Breeding Cult, but lacks further explanation of Sandeman and depth into the existing world surrounding Max such as the conflicts with the transgenics. The story leads to an interesting ending that somehow left a feeling of waking up from an unfinished dream.Although the book was entertaining, it lacked the depth of the two Dark Angel seasons. What was happening with Terminal City? acceptance of the transgenics? Joshua's story? what happened to Sandeman? Lydecker? the Jam Pony gang of friends?The story could have involved more of the existing world and its issues."
4,Happy so far,"I have only used this for about four workouts but I like it so far. I upgraded from a ""body by jake olympic bench rack"" because I wanted to lift heavier without the danger of dropping the weight on myself. Easy to assemble. I use it for squats, straight leg deadlifts, standing overhead press, pullups - if I lift my legs up, dips, bench press. Only negative is that the paint scratches easily. But then again I didn't buy it to look at.Update: After 3 months of use 3 times a week I am still pleased with this purchase.Update: 2+ yrs of use. Showing a little more wear but no complaints."
1,A huge disappointment.,"When I first learned of this movie, I was ecstatic to be able learn about Ichi's past and how he became Ichi the Killer. Unfortunately, this movie was a complete let down.The quality of the film was very cheap and amateur, and its focus didn't really seem to be about Ichi at all. What seemed to be the main focus was another character's insecurities about his strengths and reputation of being a tough guy (the story was extremely weak). This movie barely touched on Ichi's development into a killer and I regret ever buying this and watching it.If you are a fan of Ichi the Killer, I strongly suggest you stay away from Ichi-1. If you're not a fan of Ichi the Killer or don't even know what that is, you should avoid this movie too."
1,what were to happen if a retarded asian made a film,"well, it would be this film.one of the worst movies, if not the worst, movie i have ever seen. miike is one of my favorite directors of all time...if i were him i would not only take this film as a insult, but also possibly kill the director and eat his innards.if you are retarded: BUY THIS FILM NOW! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.if not... well... go rent Gozu."
2,"Pros and Cons only in this book, its not about taking better pictures","This book is only about the pros and cons of switching from film to digital. The title is VERY MISLEADING, this book is not about shooting better digital portrait photos at all. If your looking for a book to learn how to take better digital portraits this is not it"
4,Jefferson Airplane is good,"It's hard to rate a greatest hits collection. But I'd just say I'd give either 4 or 5 stars to all the songs on this album. Best songs are ""White Rabbit"" and ""Volunteers."""
4,Something to love.,"This is pretty much your basic ""Worst Of"" (best of). It's 15 remastered tracks, which has everything that the casual fan is probably looking for. Included are the hits ""Somebody To Love"" and ""It's No Secret"", as well as ""Volunteers"", which was on the ""Forrest Gump"" soundtrack, and ""White Rabbit"", which was on the ""Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas"" soundtrack. Everything else here is quality stuff, and a good sign of the times. I'd recommend this over all other collections. The ""Worst of"" is the best."
3,"Not perfect, but smooth-jazz fans should check this one out","Miles Jaye (who switched from his birth name of Miles Davis to avoid being confused with ""that"" Miles Davis) began his solo career as a soul-jazz singer who scored a few R&B hits in the 80s & 90s before concentrating mainly on jazz. He doesn't break any new ground here, but is a capable jazz musician who makes music that's nice to listen to."
3,I remember when.....,"I remember when I use to eat these all the time, then I stopped for a while and tried them again recently. I think I know why I stopped. First off its a lot to spend on a pastery that has such little filling in it. Second is that it has more crust then it does filling which make it taste like carboard. Honesly I just pick one up at the dollar store when i see them just when I want a quick cheap snack and I don't have much cash on me. My opinion is that they raised the price and cut the filling."
1,Kellogg's Pop Tarts are NOT KOSHER,"Unless I am terribly mistaken, Kellog's Pop Tarts are not kosher. I wish they were, I always loved them. I once wrote to Kellog's requesting that they make Kosher Pop Tarts. Sadly, I was informed that there were no immediate plans to make Pop Tarts kosher, however I should try their Nutrigrain products which were Kosher. The new Go Tart product has a KD, however, I have not researched the product as to whether or not it is recommended."
4,BRITISH HUMOR AT IT'S BEST!!!,"THE CAST OF ALL WOMEN, IF YOU ADORE AB FAB YOU WILL ENJOY THIS SET. TRACFY ALLMAN, RUBY WAX, DAWN FRENCH AND JENNIFER SAUNDERS, WORK TOGETHER LIKE OLD PROS, AND THIS IS THEIR EARLY WORK. YOU WILL LAUGH OFTEN."
2,Much Too Silly,"Iam sorry, but I just did not like this one, and I usually love French and Sanders and Ulman. This, I did not like at all. Would not recommand."
3,something good,"not have good signal released from the steering wheel, I sent the model that I do not buy.is not the same as the image that appears on page"
4,CLASSIC OLDIES MOVIES,IF YOU LIKE CLASSICE OLDIES MOVIES YOU WILL LIKE THIS. WE ENJOYED IT SO MUCH THAT WE ORDERED ALL OF THE DICK TRACY'S WITH RALPH BYRD. BETTER THAN WHAT IS ON TV NOW WITH ALL THE PROFANE LANGUAGE.
5,Eternal Sparks in a Finite World,"Dr. Hoffman is a master at bringing heavenly matters down to earth. He lets us know that each one of us has a bit of The Divine Fire blazing in our hearts. His message comforts us with the knowledge that The Eternal Being is always at hand, ready to help and sustain us if we only seek His Presence.Dr. Hoffman's co-author Rabbi Zalman Shachter also writes with warmth and the gentle, sincerity of one who truly wants to share a precious secret with us. His insights ring with the clarity of an authentic spiritual master.I highly recommend this book to all who truly seek to serve God while living in the modern world. Dr. Hoffman's skill with the written word allows even a spiritual novice to be more mindful of the unique divine path each individual walks through life. This book is truly a Spark of Light."
5,"Great, functional, stylish",I absolutely love these sandals. I wear them all the time casually and to work as well during the warmer months. They've held up great so far and I've had them for a year. I would definitely recommend. They are so cute and I've gotten so many comments on them.
5,Notorius Abess,"This is a book full of the interesting events the Abess Hodierna goes through. Her events include magical conjurings and taking care of fantastical animals to encounters with the Devil himself. ""Providing a refreshing change from today's typical fantasy heroines, Abess of Shaston is neither and invinsable sorceress nor a princess in desguise. She is clever and compassionate with an independent spirit, sensible though easily led astray by insatiable curiosity."" This book is nothing as it seem and is a perfect time to say, ""Don't judge a book by its cover."""
5,can't seize the land before it's been described,"This is a story of dispossession and of cultural memory. Mark Warhus reveals an astonishing legacy of native American cartography. Most of the maps are snapshots of important moments in the collision of two cultures. Some of these maps are the absolute last artifacts of tribes who have disappeared, such as the maps of Shanawdithit (Nancy) the last surviving member of the Beothucks (or Red Indians of Newfoundland).Other maps demonstrate the deep ties to tribal lands once lost but more recently regained.Native American mapmaking is intertwined with oral history. Therefore, these maps are also historical treasures."
2,Not a hollowed-out clave,"The picture on this is deceiving. I thought I was buying a hollowed-out clave that would be much more resonant. That said, the sound isn't too bad, but I'm just keeping it for the kids to play with."
5,"Fits well, good replacement switch cover","Fit well, not too tricky to insert. My flashlight has new life now and is once again waterproof! Thank you!"
4,Pretty Good,"well, it does what it suppose to do. Just make sure you get a good bit of these cuz they lose without you even noticing and they are pretty cheap. so can't complain"
5,Where do those buttons go ??,Mine either fall out some how while at work or they just plain wear out.Make sure when you order you get plenty of them and manage your shipping costs. There's no other way to get them especially if you have more than one flashlight around the house or work.It just feels better with the rubber switch seal in place and for the money it's worth it!
5,Best Book on the Subject!,"I love this book! It has a wealth of information and ideas for celebrating the Saints! I wish it were re-printed. I was so happy to buy this out-of-date copy, I'd been looking for years. It contains themes, recipes and prayers to make a Namesday ~ your patron Saint's Feast Day ~ very special."
5,THE RCA HITS ARE BACK,"Ross' RCA Greatest Hits collection is tight. I know many people are angry that songs like Eaten Alive, Pieces of Ice, Up Front, Touch by Touch, Telephone, All of You, So Close, Dirty Looks, Tell Mama, Mr. Lee and Shockwaves aren't included, but after a few times of playing the album; the songs included on the album works just fine without them. Swept Away, Chain Reaction, Muscles, Missing You, Why Do Fools Fall in Love, Mirror Mirror and the solo version of Endless Love are all great, but what surprise me were the songs from her '87 critically acclaim album-Red Hot Rhythm & Blues. The 5 songs from this album are great to listen to. Tell me Again, Summertime, Selfish One, Cross My Heart and It's Hard for Me To Say should have made Red Hot Rhythm & Blues a major hit."
5,Not Really Greatest Hits.....,"This cd should've been titled the Best of the RCA years, this is a nice overview of Diana's RCA years which the Lady recorded some great and not so great songs, the cd booklet contains great liner notes, this cd gives some of those overlooked lp cuts a second chance to be heard again."
2,RCA 1981-87 -- All For You ----------Not!,"I've read the previous reviews and I agree with most of them. Diana went to RCA which to many fans would condider a ""music wasteland"". Just glancing at this collection says it all.I did find out what many people were wondering: All For You duet with Julio. The song was released as a COLUMBIA single instead of RCA; thus RCA did not own the rights to the song. If Diana ever did the duet with JULIO live, then they should have included it here. Does anyone know if a live track exists?If you have her box set then you don't need this collection. Her RCA years should of been better and I did not blame her for going back to MOTOWN."
1,"""Pieces Of Ice"" is missing!","The liner notes for this compilation CD admit that the single ""Pieces Of Ice,"" was the highest charting single from Diana Ross's 1983 RCA album ""Ross,""...and yet it is nowhere to be found on this collection disc! Instead we get ""Love Or Lonlieness,"" an album track that was not even released as a commercial single. The fact that ""Pieces Of Ice,"" a brilliant, spooky track, is missing is a real disappointment...only made worse by the fact that the original CD is out of print! This compilation was a fan's last hope for ""Pieces Of Ice,""...but no such luck. No wonder the 1983 CD ""Ross"" sells for $50 to $100 a piece on eBay."
1,Where are the hits?,"I give this 1 star only because it is Diana Ross. Diana herself, of course, is a five. But, the adults at RCA must have been on vacation and let the children take over when this hits compilation was put together. That is the only explanation for such a poor RCA greatest hits package. It is missing WAY TOO MANY hits. While all of the LP tracks are fair to good on this compilation, they are not the best LP tracks and certainly not the hits. When are record companies going to start putting THE HITS on greatest hits and best of packages? That is what the consumer wants, not the record company's idea of what they think is best. Diana is still supreme but this RCA supposed-hits package is better left in the bargain bin. You are better off getting her complete RCA albums on compact disc, even though some are difficult to find. RCA should take tips from Motown which has done a much better job of compiling her Motown material."
2,Avid listener,"Whilst Miss Ross' stint at RCA was a relativley short one she did make some great records there with a lot of them being absent from this enjoyably about average album. Red Hot rythm n blues wqs one of her greatest recordings at RCA, infact to date and there are such a lot of the really good material missing from it. Ok so who agrees: where is Dirty Looks,Stranger In Paradise,Sweet Surrender, Crime Of Passion, Shine, i could go on. On saying that there are some good tracks featured on this like the breattakingly beautiful Summertime, swept away and of course how can you forget Chain Reaction.On the whole disappointing.If only Ross had handpicked the tracks herself this could or would be a lot better!"
2,Fragments lopped off and melted away,"Ms. Diana should have overseen the assembly of this compilation; there is not a hit that I really want here. ""Pieces of Ice"", her sorely underrated #30 or so pop hit is conspicuously absent. Diana has admitted not being able to remember the hits of some of her Supremes days, so maybe its omission is all for the best, as she would be forced to own up to it in concert and probably does not have the recall at her age to do so. Some of her fans who bought such a 'Greatest Hits' compilation may expect it-even if, arugably, it was not one of her classics. Its mere appearance on a Greatest Hits set does make it somewhat mandatory for concerts, though, and my intuition tells me that ""Pieces of Ice"" is something she would rather forget-even if it was progressive '80s music. On the brigher side, classics ""Muscles"" and Daryl Hall's ""Swept Away"" are here though."
1,Greatest Hits? Where?,A terribly misleading title for a terribly selected group of songs. Considering Ross had but a handful of hits during her brief RCA tenure (1981-1987) is not a reason for a collection. Most of the material was junk then and is junk now. Only the most die-hard fans would want this collection. Don't waste your time or money.
5,Excellent replacement for LGA 775,"Previous 3 year old CPU died. This is a great replacement for a 9400 even though it's a little slower. Rather than scrapping the computer, I have a nice extra computer for $40. Company shipped fast and sent along the heatsink/fan assembly which saved another $10 plus shipping. I'm very pleased."
1,received wrong size,ordered an adult men's and got a kids size and when I called was told that the size was right in the description - basically called me an idiot and was not helpful in beginning the return process/
4,Costume Looked good flimsy,The costume ran a little small considering my son was 7 years old and it was supposed to fit 10-13 year old. It ripped almost immediatly but on the fllip side lasted throgh all of the the trick or treating. It was cheaply made but I wasn't expecting durable at such a cheap price.
3,Good information,"This book relates basic dog care information in a fairly well written format. I also purchased the boxer training book from the same author thinking there would be some help not offered there. If you have already purchased a boxer, then I would skip this title and only get the training book. Much of the information is redundant between the books except the deciding if you really want a boxer part."
4,Good Guide to Owning a Boxer,"I thought The Boxer Handbook was very informative--went into great depth about the orgin and history of the boxer. Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone considering purchasing a Boxer for the first time."
3,Bought for the Dave solo,The Dave solo is worth nabbing if you are a big fan of his. Other than that ... nothing much to hear here.
4,Incredible Incredibles,"I love this game. My daughter and I are big Ratchet and Clank fans and look for games with similiar play. We found that in the Incredibles game. It's exciting and challenging. As we get playing it , I wonder if it is too easy at times, but then I get to a spot that I can't accomplish until I do it 10 times. My favorite thing about the game is , after conquering the first level as Mr. Incredible, you then get to be Mrs. Incredible, Dash, Violet, etc. Great fun."
2,It should be called The Impossible!!,"I thought the game was fun in some areas, but REALLY HARD to play in other areas. Whats with that huge Ball??? It's so hard to beat, it just wasn't fun to play!! IT gets so frustrating and why would they make some areas Impossible to play! I was very disappointed in it. I sure wouldn't call it Incredibles, I would call it The Impossible!! I dont think it's worth the money."
3,great movie okey game,i loved the movie but the game wasint great because the gameplay is very hard the game was almost immpossiple to beat.
2,No one will be super!,"Shouldn't you people know by now?Say it with me:NEVER BUY MOVIE GAMES.A friend of mine bought it and it was horrible.It was way too easy to die in,etc,etc,etc.Hey listen.Keep you money.Your investment isn't in here,"
3,"Fun, but hard","I let my 9 year old son decide on this review because it is his game. He says it's fun, but he wishes it was two player. Some of the levels are pretty hard and he hasn't been able to get past them. He usually can play games that are hard and beyond his age without a problem. Incredibles 2 is a two player game and my kids like that one better because it's easier."
3,not what i was expecting ..........,"well i went to the movie, and i liked it alot, it was really incredible. but the game.... ah, it's just not the same. it was mediocre , not something great.... i mean sure, it was kinda fun, but it got repetetive after a while.and there wasn't a big replay value to it . the graphics were pretty good, though. but i wouldn't recommend the game, unless you're a huge fan of the movie ."
3,Not to good,"I love the movie, The Incredibles, so i was really dissapointed when i beat this game in 1 day! It is the easiest thing ever. I would not buy this game. It is a total waste of money."
1,Truly Un-Incredible.,"This game is boredom of the week. There are 4 kins of boring levels.Mr. Incredible: Beat up guys, destroy guys, kill guys, repeat.ElastiGirl: Okay,I guess but very hard. I like Skyline Strech but I HAAAAAAAATE Finding Mr. Incredible.Dash: Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, fall, die, repeat. Run away ,Dash you idiotic moron.Violet: Boring, stoopitt!Graphics: 5Sound: 4.5Gameplay: 2.5Long lasting: 1.3Overall: 3.5Final Verdict:Movie: Good. Game: Lama, lame, lame! Rent not buy. Or better yet, dont even rent it at all."
5,Better than plastic bottles,"The bottle's boomerang design aids in easy handling and positioning for the kittens. The feeding nipples are more like mother's nipple. The length, size and softness (texture) is more natural. The kittens take it in their mouth easier. The opposite end with it's depressing plunger helps to continue pressure flow. It comes with it's own bristle brush for washing the interior.The feeding bottle is glass, which I like. However, I had to re-adjust myself to glass since personally I use glass minimally at home now.I do love this product for my ease of use and I love that my 4 hour kittens took to them instantly."
3,What is the Electric Car?,"This movie is nice because they trie to explain in simple words what is the electric Car?. It have interviews, you can see different models of electric cars. The quality was perfect.Thanks"
3,From a Civil/Geological Engineering student's view...,* Poor index - no detail * Good detail in text on subjects covered * Has some errors in the chapter on flownets * Disjointed in discussion of compaction * Good for students with little to no soil mechanics background
3,"Good, but sometimes spotty.","I read it avidly upon its arrival and found it generally very interesting.However, I started to wonder what Fiona was trying to achieve or say by about 2/3rd's the way through.. So many different discussions and unfortunately, many of those NOT by her, left me feeling she did more of an editorial job than actual writing.And pray tell, since when does an Australian refer to ""mom"" ? !!Oh please Fiona, if you want to target Americans, then say so up-front. If you're supposed to be citing Australians, then leave them saying MUM...A good book, but with areas that may leave you as puzzled as I was... oh - and skip the porn pages - they're not worth reading...If you want an interesting book, then this is indeed one to read. Just don't expect every page to be rivetting."
4,Refreshing Book on Breastfeeding,"I just recently became a breastfeeding mom for the first time and so I have been looking for books on breastfeeding. I've read lots of manuals and was refreshed to find a book on the subject that wasn't a how-to. Fresh Milk covers many different aspects of breastfeeding including the ones not talked about much like breastfeeding an older child, using lactation in the bedroom and cooking with breastmilk. There are stories of breastfeeding adopted children, older children and triplets. There are stories about the pressure to breastfeed versus bottlefeed, breastfeeding while you work and learning how to breastfeed. It's a good read for those people like me who like to know a lot about a subject before they do it. Even the parts I didn't agree with, I still read and tried to keep an open mind about. Reading the book also made my breasts fill with milk and helped me to pump more milk during a time when my baby was away from me."
1,Only one OS,"I was really excited to about the iRiver H10...until I tried to set it up and discovered that it only works with Windows XP and nothing else. It had all the features I wanted and it would have been great, but I am not changing my operating system just to use an mp3 player."
1,Terrible product! Don't waste your money!,"I was given the iriver H10 as a gift. Upon opening the box, two inserts read,""STOP, before returning this product........."" That should have been my first clue that something was wrong. The second insert recommended that I contact iriver via e-mail if I had a problem. I did contact them, over a week ago, still no response! The product is terrible! It copied my whole MY documents file. I tried to delete it, it wouldn't allow me to do so. Now, when I return the product for a FULL refund, I have to make sure the salesperson can delete my files in the H10. Also, EVERY time I tried to download files, it froze my computer! Absolutely the worst! Don't buy it."
4,Recommended,Bought this with some reservations based on the negative reviews that I read. It has worked perfectly for me. Synced to WMP 10 with no problem. Have purchased songs online (from Walmart!) and had no problem listening to them on either the H10 or my other iRiver player. I would recommend this player to others and have had good luck with three different iRiver MP3 players that I own.
2,i would not repeat this mistake!,"i got this from amazon at july the iriver h10 5GB is great i absoloutly loved it!i got it in america because in israel its double the pricethe thing is, it stopped working after 2 weeks.i sent it to a company to get it fixed in an israeli company who claims she sent it 2 an iriver service center to be fixed )for a small fee)iriver kept on stalling the item from coming back and im waiting for it 4 about 4 monthes now.if a product like this breaks down after 2 weeks its not worth buying.make shore you have someone to fix it if the time comes.if i would want 2 buy something else i would buy thishttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AA7MQA/002-1985327-8376867?v=glance&n;=172282&n;=507846&s;=electronics&v;=glance"
2,Comparison B/N Zen Micro and H10,"Do not buy this player as its sound quality is nowhere near to the Creative Zen Micro , Only good thing about this player is Good FM reception , It gives distored sound with EQ settings .I have tried with studio series sony headphones also , whereas with full volume and EQ settings Zen micro gives very ultimate sound.But if someone wants fancy look and facility to store the JPG files can go for this player."
3,Meh...,"It works, but is sort of hard to use and the battery dies in about an hour and a half. It is also bigger than I tought it would be."
2,Okay....For now,"I had my last mp3 player swiped, so I got this used, and it's a good stop-gap until I get a new mp3 player."
4,not the best choie for ebooks,"The iRiver series has some great advantages for music. It offers gapless playback, avoiding two-second pauses when listening to a complete album (which can ruin continguous transitions on albums such as Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon). And many reviews suggest it offers higher fidelity for complex sound.One downside: This is one of the only players not supported (at least explicitly) by audible.com, favored as having the largest library of downloadable audiobooks/ebooks. There are some ways around that, such as third-party software that requires being a bit more tech savvy than you might be. But if audiobooks are your thing, an alternative (such as the Creative Zen line, or the industry-leading iPod) may be preferable."
3,Bleeding Edge!,"Bought it for the Janus/drm compat:Learned quickly there are lot's of shortcomings with DRM / Janus / subscription technology. Technology is still in it's infancy. Too bad for those of us who want it NOW.An ok mp3 player (audio quality should be better) handles non-drm music files aplomb.If you are not an computer geek, you may find it extremely time consuming getting it to work with subscription drm.Lots of formats, firmware updates, tricks are involved in getting the first tracks to play.Even when it works- slow slow. changing tracks takes 3-5secs even with latest firmware 2.03.SO- IF you are not the type that will enjoying tinkering with this device, you're probably better off purchasing tracks (Real Jukebox 10). Don't count on the susbscription services being easy to use!"
2,Could Be Great - But Deeply Flawed,"Beware!This is a great-looking player - sleek, color screen, and so forth. But, as of this writing, it has serious flaws in functionality and sound.- Any significant bass distorts when using my Koss Portapro headphones (I've used them for many other players with no problems). I'm not talking thunderous bass - just typical stuff, with equalizer set flat.- Player only lists (and plays) songs alphabetically, rather than by track numnber, which has proved to be even more annoying than I thought it would.- Player can take a long time to skip from one song to the next.It is possible that these problems will be fixed by a firmware upgrade (that does not yet exist). It is possible that they cannot be fixed by firmware, or that iRiver will simply choose not fix them. I'd strongly recommend that propesctive buyers wait until all is repaired rather than taking a risk."
1,Couldn't Get It to Work!!!,"I was so excited when I bought this player but when I plugged it into my computer, I ran into a few major problems.1) Windows media player didn't recognize it so I couldn't transfer songs to it. I installed Windows Service Pack 1 (as suggested by Auto Support) and still nothing. I went to download the latest firmware but when I installed it, now my computer couldn't recognize it.2) Also this player is supposed to be a hard drive too, but auto support stated that ALL the files have to be transfered using Windows Media Player. I think that's really gay and it's a classic example of battles between corporations. iPod is the same way since you have to use iTunes to transfer anything to it. Microsoft wants to make you dependent on their software. In my opinion, Windows Media Player is a low quality program full of garbage advertising ads. Winamp and DivX are wayyyyyyyyyy better!!!I would look for a better alternative (avoid anything with the letter i)."
2,STILL DOESN'T WORK,"Sure this seems like a great product, but after a month of hour long costumer service phone waits (by the way their costumer service stinks) and downloading millions of different components my Iriver still doesn't work. Conceptually a great product, but I'm going to stick with my Ipod and Itunes since they actually function."
4,iRiver H10,my first hard drive MP3 player - used for ~3 weeks and have been very satisfied. listened to music as well as books on tape and have been more than satisfied. as mentioned in other reviews it takes a few seconds to boot up but I am alright with that... only problem is the earbuds are not perfect matches for my ears - haven't found a pair that were but am still looking. above all I'd recommend the unit.
1,Very Disappointed,"I have been a Rapsody customer since the first few months it was in place and I have always loved their model (subscription for unlimited songs). When they came out with the ability to transfer these songs to a mobile device, I was all over it. I upgraded the membership, went and purchased the product they advertised (iRiver H10 - 5GB) and thought I would be in high cotton.....Not???The device locks up always. Controls are hard to find and use. Rapsody software does not work with the device most of the time (lock ups, bad syncs, extremely slow). User interface is extremely difficult to use (slow, not intuitive in places)."
1,Two bad units,"Unfortunately, I can't comment on the quality of music playback as I never got that far. The first player would only display a white screen. iRiver technical support informed me that I had a ""bum unit"". Thankfully, Amazon has a very efficient return policy, but the second unit didn't do any better. It froze on the boot up screen, after waiting only ten minutes for technical support we went through various fixes before I was again informed that I had a bad unit.I'm now returning the units for a refund. I don't have any confidence in the quality of the H10 and it doesn't help that included in the paperwork is an orange flier with ""STOP"" typed on it, instructing you to contact iRiver support before returning the product. It only leads me to believe that they have had numerous problems.iRiver does earn one star with very adequate technical support, but it's unfortunate that the quality of product requires that support."
2,Bad purchase,I River does not make good MP3 players. I suggest you avoid I River. It died after 3 or 4 months. Stick with a I Pod.
1,Hate it!!!,"My iriver H10 has been a trouble-maker since I bought it. It plays when it wants, doesn't play when it wants. I use Napster To Go to download songs (which is a fine program for my needs). If you're thinking about an H10, don't bother. If you're thinking about an iriver... don't bother. I've been SO disappointed with this little booger of an mp3 player. Right now I'm trying to reformat it because Napster told me the player needs reformatting and I can't download any songs until this is done. WTF!? Spend your money on something else."
2,Disappointing,"The H10 is a nice looking device that doesn't work. I have a constant reoccurring problem where the device will hang when you select a song or playlist. The hourglass (initializing) will remain until the unit runs down the battery. The only solution is to reinstall the firmware which also deletes all your files. You have to use Windows Media Player to transfer and sync files. WMP is clumsy to use. It is not user friendly at all. Anyway, after the firmware reinstall it will work for a while and then just start hanging again. I used to be a faithful iRiver customer, but not any more."
5,excellent,Always been a fan of John Gary and am delighted with this cd of some of his songs. So glad to have gottenit!!
5,The Very Best of John Gary is just that. The very best!,"I love this CD. Every song on it warms my heart in some way.Some of the most beautiful music of the twentieth century, styled and sung by one of our greatest vocal artists. It is magnificent, and not to be missed."
5,Road to Augusta,Very interesting book about the formation of the Southern Baptist Convention. I am a little biased since he is my relative. Thomas L. Howell
5,It is just that good,"This is not metal-core. Thank god!! This is music for the fan against what is big at the moment. Nu metal has passed, and Metal-core has failed. With that in mind, the sound of Seemless goes beyond today's standards of instrumental music. Which has probably reached an all time low. Think of it this way, if Soundgarden was known for being the second coming of Led Zepplin, then Seemless could be known as the second coming of Soundgarden. However, Seemless is a group that mixes all that is right for rock, and combines it with their own sound. So you now have a band that will and should build its own legacy, such as the previous bands mentioned did. Buy it and get into it, and celebrate the beauty of real musicians."
2,TOTALLY UNWARRANTED COMPARISONS ABOUND!,"I really wanted to like this record...but...this does not sound like COC, Soundgarden, or Kyuss! Its sounds like Godmack playing on Qotsa's equipment...this would fit in better on the radio alongside Staind and Creed, which is not to say that there aren't some good elements of this album, but overall this is simply mediocre AOR radio rock. You could consider this an extension of bands influenced by the Seattle sound, Qotsa, and Sabbath that just don't have the original or artistic slant of it's predecessors! Bottom line-not terrible, but nothing we all haven't heard played into the ground on the radio for the last 10 years!!!"
5,Best new Rock and Roll band in quite some time....,"Seemless, led by former Killswitch Engage singer Jesse David, is one of the best rock albums ive heard in quite sometime. Its comparable to the likes of Zeppelin, Sabbath, CoC, Down, or Soundgarden. This band is totally going with a back to basics style of heavy blues driven music. Jesse really showcases his voice, he really can sing with the best of them. I highly reccomend this album to anyone craving real hard rock, and especially to any Killswitch fans out there, Jesse does not dissapoint."
5,Surprisingly excellent!,"When I first heard the samples from their website, I thought ""What a poor COC ripoff"". I was WAY too quick to judge. After seeing the ""Lay My Burden Down"" video and giving them a 2nd chance, I am literally blown away by how good this is. People are comparing it to COC, Kyuss, and Soundgarden, which is the popularized comparison. Its definitely not as dark and negative as COC & not as poppy as Soundgarden. I would say an important band forgotten in the mix is Fu Manchu, because Seemless has that fun element they add to this kind of rock.Jesse's voice really stands on its own here. I always felt that while Jesse's voice was interesting for KsE, it just was not the right fit. He changed things up a bit, and BAM, a fun hard-rocking, southern metal showdown. Not bad for some New England boys!I actually much prefer this to the new COC. Much catchier and definitely not as brooding as In the Arms of God."
2,"It is ok, not exactly what I expected.","I was hoping for more insider tips to help someone moving to Texas. Instead it was mostly stories about her experiences. Not what I would call a ""survival guide."""
5,arrived quickly & in good condition,"Arrived in good time and like new. Gave as a gift to colleague moving to Texas from NJ so haven't read it, but title and back were amusing."
3,Okay,"Good info, nothing earth-shattering. I meant to get the James Dobson book but purchased this one by mistake. It wasn't for me."
4,Great hitch rack - does not fit Honda Fit hitch,"The rack is great, but the 1.25 version does not fit my Honda Fit 2008 hitch.The problem is that the receiver tongue is about 0.24 inch too long, so that I could not insert the pin.Called Yakima. They were nice and mentioned: Known problem.To their defense I found a statement on their website that stated that with this car it might or might not fit.Guess I am in the might not fit category.Anyway I looked at Thule and their receiver is about 0.5 inches shorter and can hold more weight. Also was easier to install.Personnely I like the Thule better. The only thing I like better with the Yakima are the standard anti-sway cradles. They are awesome.With the Thule you have to purchase those separately for 20$.Great rack but didn't fit on Honda Fit 2008 hitch."
3,"Doesn't fit on '09 Wrangler with 32"" Spare","Doesn't fit on '09 Wrangler with 32"" Spare, I had to modify the rack to fit. Otherwise, it works well."
3,Easy install....gets more difficult after that.,"I installed this unit myself. It is well made & goes together easily. I thought I should hold off & wait for my husband, but decided to give it a try & no problems. Instructions are clear & it fit into my hitch with no problems. If you are shorter, I'm 5'3"", the hitch is tall for me. It's a little difficult to lift my bike onto & the off of the rack. The rubber straps while secure, are not easy to get on and off the rack once secured. I had no worries about the rack or bike falling off, but getting the bike on & off is a different story. Happy with the purchase overall."
2,2001 is ancient for an Internet Business Plan Book,"The book, Internet Business Plan, by Robert Weinberg, has all the merits of an excellent Business Plan book.For the internet, it is lacking. The book is dated 2001 and that is extremely dated for use for an Internet business. The appendix references AltaVista as a search engine...There is one good story of an un-successful story with DCG in chapter 10 that has tips you can learn from. There is a success story of a company that started in the late 1970's and then went online in the 1990's, which is not relative to most internet businesses today. The Appendix has an example of a fish and condiments business and a ""doohickie"" business both, bricks and clicks companies, not a purely internet based companies.The standard set of forms are included. Nothing internet specific. The simple executive summary on pages 108-110 are probably the most valuable pages in the book.Good Luck!Professor Click"
5,Don't be afraid of the title. Buy the book!,"Don't let the somewhat unwieldy title put you off: the book delivers exactly what the title says it will. Weinberg's book is written in a friendly, conversational tone that is easy to digest. Another reviewer noted that he read Weinberg's book in a weekend. That is easy to do. Weinberg is a natural teacher. You may pick up his book expecting something akin to shoveling snow uphill in a New England winter but instead you find a voice that charms and entertains you, all the while teaching you what you need to know about getting your .com business up and running. I strongly recommend this book."
1,Possible boat anchor,"Wow it doesn't take much to be an anvil, but this thing falls short in just about every direction except heavy. It's painted with a nice hammered finish.. why would you paint an anvil? Oh now I see to hide all the rust underneath. It looks nothing like the picture. Nothing is flat or smooth or round like it should be. They spent more time casting the big china in the side than anything else. The pic doesn't show that either. Oh well a week with a grinder and maybe i can make it look like an anvil. Weather it will perform like one is another thing altogether. Northern Industrial if this is what you sell I don't want anymore."
3,Great bronzer but pretty dark,"I was looking for a new bronzer to try and was encouraged by other reviewers commenting on their pale skin and noting that this bronzer worked for them...I'm pretty pale, and even with my current summer tan this bronzer is way too dark if I put it on the way I put on my last bronzer (Physicians Formula for medium skin tones). It looks blotchy against my skin unless I put it on really lightly and try to just hit the lighter side of the compact with my applicator brush. It does look really fantastic applied more like eyeshadow to my eyelids. Good product but not for the pale skinned :)"
4,"Some good tunes missiing, but overall not bad.","As the years have gone on, I have been given a bad time about listening to the same music since 1970. My Guess Who albums, every one ever released, have been played so much that they have lost their zip. This collection is the best available and sounds great. A few of my favorite tunes are not included such as Talisman, Just Let Me Sing and a few others, but since I am a die hard fan, I can't expect a collection to have it all. If you need a dose of Guess Who, you can't go wrong with this collection."
2,same great music on new album. no rarities. dissapointing,"i was first introduced to the guess who when i was a boy. my father had the canned wheat album. our favorite song on the album was "" the key "" as far as i know this song has never been put on a cd. i would love to hear it again. i thought it would be on this cd for sure. thanks"
1,This one is a design disaster ... stay away,"I ordered this unit based on the Sanyo name and the price. I should have known - you get what you pay for. Not even 60 days after receiving it, and with very light use - probably about 40 hours total, it conked out. It just shut down when we tried to rewind a tape (nothing wrong with the tape) and would not stay turned on after that. No rewind, no play, no eject - nothing. You pushed the ON switch, the wheels moved the tape about six inches, and then the power cycled off. On-off, on-off. The tape was locked inside, and I had to take off the top of the housing to retrieve it. Wow - how much plastic can you put in a VCR? I think Sanyo was going for a record. Very few metal parts, and lots of thin plastic ones, just waiting to break. I had to pry the cassette out of the holder - I couldn't even make the retention mechanism ""let go"". We decided to simply throw this one out, and go purchase something that is designed to last a while. What a piece of junk!"
1,unhappy,I ordered a VCR based on the write up that said it had auto clock set.I wanted one with a clock. It didn't have a clock so I returned it for one that has. I am still waiting.
5,Hooked On Classics,The Danze Opulence Antique Copper Robe Hook is exactly as pictured.Sturdy and elegant we are very pleased with all five hooks we purchasedand gladly recommend them to others.~ Mrs. B.
3,"Absolutely no maps, imagined quoted conversations",The book traces Marquette's life through rural France and through the St. Lawrence and into Michigan. Absolutely no maps to provide the reader with a sense of place. French & Indian names are used to describe places now known under a different idenity. The author SEEMS to place Michilimackinac at multiple locations without explanation.
5,good quality and easy to install,easy to install and good quality product. Outstanding service from Amazon. It was ordered along with the extension cord and everthing matched perfect.
5,A Trip Back in Time,"Undoubtedly, this book took me back to the New York of my childhood. I grew up on Jewish, Italian, Chinese, Greek food and Corned Beef and Cabbage. My ethnicity is none of those, but I treasure this book and all the memories it brought me. The recipes were magnificent! Thanks for the very nostalgic walk and knowing I can taste a little of New York no matter where I am!"
4,Unique Book on New Yorks Food History,This book shows a pictorial and editorial history of New York through its foods and diverse cultures and communities.Not as many recipes as I would have liked but the recipes it did have were great. Really a gem for anyone who has an interest in regional cuisines and cultures.
3,Power Of Soul,"Loran's Dance by Idris Muhammad is amazing. I wish that Loran's Dance could be found on other albums by Idris. The collection of Soul artists is very extensive, covering muscicians that you may not know by name. It provides a good stepping stone for those interested in Soul music, but not sure where to begin buying. Also, is a great resource for the avid Sould listener. Not a bad buy. It's worth it for Idris."
1,not very good,First of all the packaging leads you to believe you are getting a variety of scenes. but you are not.I did not think the resolution was high def quality and I watched it on two very nice monitors.Very disapointed.
4,Pro-active thinking!,Bob Nelson has assembled a quick reading book on popular business concepts and situations facing a regular employee. He offers suggestions on becoming more pro-active than re-active to situations that arise through out many different careers. Nelson also gives examples of true story scenarios in which a person took a chance or challenged an idea and was later promoted for it. He talks about successes and also failures in careers in which people either sat on the sidelines or got in the game. This book most can probably read in a day as it is under 100 pages and reads very fast. It has quick chapters and a lot of useful insight.
3,An ok book,"Basic and obvious tips, worth reading just to remind you how things should be execute by proactive employees. Do not expect revolutionary ideas or unbelievable findings from this book. Three stars out of five."
2,Not so thrilled,I was a bit disappointed after reading the book because I thought the author was giving 'general advice' rather than 'specific tips'. I would rather recommend 'The Administrative Assistant' (Crisp Publications)
2,Grapefruit juice,The color protrayed of the product is definitly not what it actually is. It is more of a red brown. This juice did not taste like blood oranges it tasted like grapefruit juice so if you like grapefruit juice it would be great. But not worth it to buy for the blood orange. Very disappointed that it did not taste as I had remembered in Italy.
4,Civilized Japanese vs barbarous Chinese: Was he bribed?,"It was during the first Sino-Japanese War, 1894-95.The Japanese government's stand was to fight a war of civilization against the premodern uncivilized China. It was to work to impress Western powers to have unequal treaty status removed, the status that had been imposed on the Japanese since the opening of Japan by the United States.Creelman reports from the battle front that Japanese soldiers rescue wounded Chinese, risking their own lives, while the Chinese desecrate fallen Japanese by cutting off their penises or disemboweling. To some contemporary cirics he sounded so partial for the Japanese that they suggested that he must have been bought by the Japanese government."
4,Not a bad read for sci-fi,"As a teacher of eighth grade English, I make it a point to keep up with young adult literature. I found this book by Shusterman to be very entertaining and compelling, until it got to the end. I felt that at the end it all kind of fell apart and became truly unrealistic. I am writing this review to show my sixth period class how to do an online review. I think it's an excellent way for students to do real-world publishing and share their opinions with others."
4,I just couln't put it down.,As I read I felt like the book just kept pulling me in. It was entertaining and thrilling.
3,Dark Side of Nowhere,The book called Dark Side of Nowhere. This book had a lot of action in it. This book has one great fight scene. This is a good to read if your bored. I recommend this book for teenagers.
5,The Best Book I've Ever Read,"This was the coolest book i've ever read. If you like sc-fi, you should read this book. It was exciting all the way through. Until you get to the end. The end is stupid. I must be dumb, but i don't really understand it(that part, at least). Other than that, it was a really cool book."
5,Love it!,"I picked this CD up after seeing the band (now Cinder Road) open for Daughtry. What a great CD. It's great strait forward rock music. The songs are catchy, and Heaven is an absolute heartbreaker."
4,"Not the best, but I loved it.","Clyde Beaty of Darkest Africa/Batmen of Africa stars in this wonderful serial. He was known as the greatest animal trainer in the world. He does battle with plenty in this. As well you see what is a little disturbing, but as well interesting and that is the fighting of a tiger and a lion. I believe this to be quite the keeper among serials and is a defintite must have for any collector. I will watch this one over and over..."
1,"Too old, Too much static",I couldnt get past the first twenty minutes. Unless you explicitly remember this as a childhood memory forget it.
2,Thank God for the ASPCA,"I watched the DVD version included in the 50 sci-fi pack, too. The film quality was fine, considering, as was the sound.But the cruelty to animals was astonishing! Staged fights between hyenas and antelope, lions and tigers, etc....amazing viewed with today's sensibilities. Five more years would pass before animals were even protected a little in the making of movies."
2,"You seen one 30s jungle movie, you seen em all","This one stars celebrity lion tamer Clyde Beatty as, well, himself, on a mission to find his girlfriend who's been lost on the mythic island of ""Kamar"". Really, Clyde doesn't even play himself very well, but he's a circus performer not an actor. His duplicious assistant undercuts him at every turn, loosing a lion on him while some unexplainably present children gawk, and engaging in some unnecessary animal cruelty. Is any animal cruelty actually necessary? Clyde's aloofness with his gal is amusing, and the scene where he tames a cage full of dozens of animals (even bears) at once is certainly impressive. But as the tag says, you seen one jungle epic, you seen em all. Take it or leave it."
5,Loved it!,"Sonny Bono has done it again in this funny book. To me, he's never stopped me from laughing at him because I have seen his variety show with Sonny and Cher and I can't stop laughing at him. He does have quite a sense of humor. He and Cher have been one of my favorite singers from the 60's/70's, even if I'm only 29 years old. I was introduced to Cher in 1998 or so before he died, I think. I did get to see her when she was doing the Farewell Tour in New Mexico, so the drive wasn't that far from my state. The reason I said not far was because I do live in the 4 Corners. I am an avid reader so I do enjoy the music history from the 50's - 70's and it stops there so yes, I do know a lot and enjoy it but I have lost touch of it lately sadly but I haven't lost my touch. This was a funny read but it does make me wonder what Sonny would've thought about his daughter turning into a man. That scares me!"
1,Don't waste your time,"Leslie Caine's characters, plot and writing style get worse and worse. The plot is tried and the character unrealistic."
3,"Great Album, Poor Quality Recording","The remastered version of Baron von Tollbooth & The Chrome Nun undoubtedly contains some exceptional songs (check out Ballad of the Chrome Nun, Fat, and the indomitable Across the Board). The material is very good, but listening is made difficult by the poor sound quality. Grace Slick's voice is obscured by the music, which in turn is obscured by the overall sound quality. Kinda sounds like listening to music at the end of a very long tunnel, very dim sounding (the term ""remastered"" is lost on this album). I still can't distinguish some of the lyrics to Ballad of the Chrome Nun, although I get the overall jist of it. This is a must if you're a Grace Slick/Jefferson Airplane fan, but if you're just a casual listener, don't bother, unless you like the tunnel effect. Buy it for the artistic vision and the witty lyrical content, not for the sound quality."
5,A must for any Jefferson Airplane/Starship Fan !,"Great songs, great artists. What else do you need? I used to have this album and the vinyl copy is a collectors item. I too have been looking for it for years! No more used record stores for me.... it's Amazon for replacing my old album collection!"
2,Not that great,"I've owned this album since it came out and after hearing other Airplane and Airplane derived music, this falls short. It has nothing to do with psychedelia. It was made for commercial purposes. Only about half the songs are any good. Kantner and Slick were pretty burnt out when they made this kitsch."
2,found scribble inside,"The book arrived with some bumped corners, and I found some scribble on a page. These are not mentioned in the description, and I'm quite disappointed."
5,We love this toy,"This is a wonderful and creative toy. The tree comes with six, lovely finger puppets. The tree itself is hollow, and you can make the puppets pop out of the tree through slits or holes in the trunk. The quality and detail of this toy is wonderful. I highly recommend it."
5,great great buy,"Worth every penny. Such a cute tree with adorable little puppets. Can take a beating and still look great. We've had it a year now and it looks brand new even after being played with a lot. My 9 year old, 8 year old, 4 year old and 2 year old all loved it. It makes a great gift too because it looks really expensive in person and is so different."
4,staying healthy with nuitrition,"While the new edition has up-to-date nutrition information, I preferred the first, and in my opinion, more comprehensive edition. I miss the recipes in the new edition. Still, this book is a must-have for anyone concerned with the quality of the food supply and its effects on us, and for people who are dealing with chronic health concerns."
4,Nutrition for dumb Physicians.,"Excellent resource for a Physician like myself. I practice functional medicine. I am wanting a nutritionist to practice with me, however they are hard to come by."
2,comprehensive but.......,"I just received this book as a gift and I am returning it. It may have been ground breaking at the time it was first published but it isn't anymore. The latest edition dates from 2006 and in a field where there is so much on-going research it does not feel all that relevant anymore at least for anyone seriously interested and reasonably updated about nutrition. Having skimmed the book I also get the impression that the author is rather quick (too quick in my view) to recommend various supplements, and the dozen or so pages of contact details to Nutritional supplement companies reinforces this impression."
4,Good book,"I'm finding this book quite interesting. It offers new ideas on health and holistic nutrition that conventional medicine hasn't explored. On the other hand, I felt it needed to include more scientific research and back up more of his comments and eliminate the ""I think"" ones - somehow one's feelings seem more appropriate to express in humanities subjects and not on nutrition."
2,no references,"This book lacks backing. You need to reference the material you are citing, otherwise you are bereft of any praise. Why should these supplements be taken, who suggests or proves that it will be beneficial?The book is lacking proof."
2,Nutrition?,When does an authoritative book that is reliable not use references? Where did the author obtain the information? Was no research done to back up what the author is saying? If not then why write it and why on earth would any body reference the book for their own nutritional needs.
5,An American Treasure,"This collection of writings from Norman Vincent Peale are inspiring, hopeful, and comforting. Each selection is worthwhile. It has been helpful to me and I hope you find it helpful, too."
4,Coconuts,"I was really hoping to have a book to read for several nights but I was disappointed that I ran out of pages after two nights. I was also disappointed that there wasn't more sex, but then again that isn't as important as it once was. Knowing something about the place (Key West) and the life (charter skipper, etc.) Dave writes about, it all felt so familiar only Dave was taking us into those hidden corners of life that one would otherwise overlook. I'm waiting for him to personally deliver me his new book. I'll be standing under the third coconut tree from the east end of the beach."
2,Length is not correct,"The comb itself is fine (it's a comb, after all). However, I bought one of these and a ClipperMate 5 inch comb -- and they're noticeably different sizes. When measured, this is about 4.5 inches. It's more noticeable than you think once you hold it in your hand (especially since you have half coarse/half fine it makes it even more apparent).Also, the product I received is not the same as in the picture -- it actually slopes down on the fine teeth side, shortening the available teeth.As another side note, the ClipperMater feels much heftier and less prone to breaking than does this cheap thing. This is my first review and never thought I'd be disappointed with a friggin' comb. I didn't think it would be that hard to replace the current coarse/fine teeth comb I have (which is obviously a ClipperMate), based on pictures given and measurement of the one I already have -- I guess they don't make my old comb anymore."
3,It's OK,Good comb but a little stiff. For some reason I thought it would be more flexible. It still meets my needs and I carry it in my back pocket.
4,Enjoyable textbook!,"I bought this book because it is THE set text for ""Studies in the New Testament"", a unit in the MA (Theological Studies) course that I am currently undertaking. What a surprise: a readable, enjoyable textbook!It has plenty of information, and is clear and accessible (there is a CD-ROM included). Above all, it is well written and really interesting - a book to keep and read for pleasure."
1,"A pretty face, but...","This is a beautiful scale, but that's about it. Blue LEDs are sexy; the design is crisp and clean. Black glass on polished marble looks great.Unfortunately, performance is very poor. The routine goes like this: First, step on - weight eventually settles - consistently 4-5 pounds high. Second, repeat (as many as five times, no more) and take the average since the data points vary over a three pound range. This process seems to get a consistently accurate approximation of your true weight on a day-to-day basis.Do not try to repeat for more data points because the scale ""crashes"" and goes into a weird mode where it just starts counting up in .2 pound increments ad infinitum. Try again and get the same counting routine, or it'll throw in a ""Lo"" (supposed to indicate a low battery, but I've already changed those), just for fun. Leave it alone for a few hours and it's ready to use again.A pretty face, but junk underneath the hood..."
4,Scale,"I think the scale works great. Once in a while it does not get a reading right away, but that is usually when I am moving around too much. The only thing that I did not like was that the batteries went dead fairly quickly (5 months). Maybe the whole family should not weigh themselves twice a day, every day. I checked with the doctor's scale and it was withing a pound. Thats pretty good for a bathroom scale."
4,Pretty good,"It looks really nice as a display. the figures themselves aren't that great. They're kind of... stuck in the position that they are in. I keep them on the stand they came with, I can't do any other poses or anything. All in all though, it was worth it just for the Emperor's chair. I really, really, like it! It's scaled perfectly. And the plus side: I can use the base/ chair with other figures more up to date figures as well.I'd recommend this to someone who is looking for a good Death Star 2 display, just get better figures!"
3,FRAGRANCE OF PRODUCT,"BEEN A USER OF PRODUCT FOR 20 YRS. YHIS BATCH NOT SAME!!!!! iT'S CLOSE, WILL TRY TO ENDURE TILL NEXT ORDER."
5,Highly recommended,"This is my first review ever of a technical book. I really love this book, and I highly recommend it. It is simultaneously useful, fun, and thought provoking."
5,Amazing Book!,"I first watch the movie and I love the history and his characters (DeNiro made an incredible part in this movie!), but the book for me were a great choice to spend time with some (very) good lecture, buy this book, it's amazing!!"
3,Ho Hum,"First off this was not a horror story. Or if it was suppose to be, it failed. To me it was a PI mystery with a twist. A very imaginative twist too but one that William Hjortsberg failed to bring alive. The whole book read like an old Raymond Chandler. That's it. There is no suspense. No buildup. No horror. No nothing really...it's a very blah book. Easy to read...nice point A to point B style but DULLSVILLE. The other reviewers must have been reading a different book. This book is nothing like a Stephen King or Dean Koontz book....not even close!...not in the slightest. Falling Angel was copyright 1978."
5,Great Yarn,"I must start by saying I loved the film; however, there were many parts of the story- puzzle missing for me. For that reason, I looked into buying the book. I was sad to see it out of print and the few copies floating about were commanding high prices. I watched and waited and finally found a paperback copy at a reasonable price. I could not put the book down. This is one of those rare cases in which both the movie and the book are great in their own right. The book is different in many ways from the movie but a thoroughly enjoyable read. So much so for me that I watched and waited and bought a hard cover copy. This book is part of my permanent library. If you like noirish detective novels, you'll enjoy this book."
4,Maximus Review,"Good and fast read. Some differences between the book and the movie for sure. Don't want to say too much in case you haven't seen the film, but not too descriptive writing and will keep you guessing for a while if you don't know anything about the book or the film."
5,"So good, I read it in a day","If you saw the movie Angel Heart, read the book anyway. Hjortsberg wrote the screen play for Angel Heart, but both the book and the movie can stand alone. His detailed descriptions of 1950's New York add to the fast-paced plot and make you feel like you are being carried along with Harry Angel while he unravels his own doom. I knew how the story ended from the movie, but the book took the whole Mephisto genre to a new level."
4,Authentic Flavor of the Old South,"This book is a rich, dreamy blend of the ""real"" New Orleans. It's fascinating and comfortable, just like the two elderly authors must be. I worked with a gentleman who was related to these two ladies. He lent me the book when I spoke of wanting to visit and delve into historic New Orleans as opposed to its sleazy facade. He didn't have extra books at the time, and the one he'd lent me was a prize possession of his family, so I couldn't keep it. I have been looking for this book ever since, about 6 or 7 years (!), and have deliberately put off a trip to the Crescent City until I could get my hands on this book. I'm delighted to be able to buy and keep the book! And I'll be delighted to visit New Orleans with it in my hands!"
3,Not Quite Like Being There,"As a lifelong Dallasite who'd love to have grown up in New Orleans (or at least to have had relatives there I could have visited often), I was hoping to find in this book a bit of the flavor of the various New Orleans neighborhoods. I wanted to see, hear, and smell the wide variety of life away from the tourist traps. The set-up for the book is promising: two ladies from different sides of town tell, in alternating chapters, about growing up in the Crescent City. Their accounts are full of the small, simple moments that recall the old days. The problem for me was: I would have preferred a greater contrast between the two ladies' backgrounds. Instead of a rich white lady and a middle-class white lady, how about a rich white lady and a poor black lady? With all the variety of New Orleans' wards, a bit more of the extremes would have made for a more evocative read."
4,Pretty good book,"This is a great book with more than a thousand actual physics problem, ranging from the high school level to university level (with vector calculus).While the book claims it's enough of a supplement to any textbook, there have been quite a few instances where it wasn't enough.So my advice is, don't use this book as a solution manual. Rather, like me, use it as a prep guide. Before exams, look over the problems related to what you're getting tested on (the book's table of contents and index are really good), and look over or even work through the problems."
2,This book is okay,"The book didn't really help me understand how to solve my physics problems in class. It was vastly different than my undergraduate engineering physics course taught how to solve problems. For the most part, it left me more confused. I purchased a different book that helped much more than this. However, the summary it has for each chapter helped me understand the concepts more. If you're looking for a book to help you solve physics for undergraduate work, I would look elsewhere."
1,Completely Useless,"I have attempted numerous times to use examples from this book as guidance when stuck on homework problems assigned in my engineering physics course and have found that the book offers nothing but further frustration. It's unorganized, the typeset is monotonous and appears as if someone typed the book on a typewriter making it difficult to focus and follow the text, and I have yet to find a worked example that has been of any use whatsoever in completing even one of my homework problems.The book does offer a lengthy chart of conversion factors."
1,I was not thrilled,"This thing is a piece of junk. It's made out of one piece of plastic and the ""pencil holder"" breaks very easily. Don't buy it."
1,Contractors opinion PIECE OF CRAP!,"I am a contractor who uses a tape measure ALL the time. I need mine to be with me and accessible easily. I purchased this product after my previous holders metal clip had worn to the point of no longer being able to securely hold the tape measure in place. They now only offer one of those stupid pouch style versions. I had that holder for about three years. This plastic piece of GARBAGE lasted two weeks before breaking in half right at the point where it angles. Learn from my mistake, spend the couple extra bucks, and buy the Klein version"
1,Too fragile for the intended environment,"My husband purchased this product for use in a cabinet shop and on installs. It broke in the first couple days of use. The company offered to replace the product, but my husband declined. He said it was just too fragile for the intended work environment and would simply break again. The company offered a refund, but to obtain a refund we'd have to ship the broken product back to them and doing so would cost more than the refund itself."
1,Poor quality,I liked the idea of some sort of holster to protect my pocket. Tapes easily destroy them fairly quickly. This thing is not up to the task. It's too flimsy. Even the pencil holster quickly became too loose to hold anything and the sharpener was misaligned and wouldn't sharpen a pencil.
