4,Green Day at their best!!! by:Alex,"Green Day is my favorite band and I heard people talking about them at school. I went out the next day and bought International Superhits and it was horrible. I think their older music was pretty bad. I ordered American Idiot and I was blown away by it. My favorite songs are St. Jimmy, American Idiot, and She's a Rebel. I don't see the point of making 10-minute songs. Some of the songs get boring after a while though, like BOBD and WMUWSE. MOst of the songs really kick butt. Overall it is an awesome cd. I wouldn't listen to the other people who give it like 3 stars. A must by for any Green Day fan.:)Peace:)"
1,Green day could never amount to METALLICA,"this is a piece of trendy trash that ruins kids plus it sound horrible i mean come on look at todays children! here allow me to list the bands your children need to listen to Metallica,PanterA,cKY,AC/DC,him,Disturbed and slayer.Hey i mabe 12 but i know what im saying. Green day are a buch of nazisDEATH METAL"
1,Boulevard of Broken Dreams Is The Only Good Song!,I'll give this CD 1 star because Boulevard of Broken Dreams isa good song. Other than that I've heard Holiday and it is whatmakes Green Day suck! Here's what to get.
1,Listening To Static On The Radio Would Be The Same,These folks have two zeros. Zero for talent. Zero for brains.This is not music-it is noise. Just like the noise a failingbearing makes in a car or other machine.Do not waste your money on this trash.These folks must be laughing all the way to the bank.
1,The mainstream sucks.,"U call this rock? This is lame. This is crap. The Ramones would lay these guys to rest. This is shameful, mainstream sell-out music. But then again, they were always sell-outs. The Sex Pistols did this 20 years ago man. Stupid and unoriginal. Green Day should die! Only fags and kids listen to this."
1,Haha way better than AC/DC,"I always hate AC/DC they suck!!!!!! Green Day has atleast onegood song, Boulevard of Broken Dreams thus ac/dc never madea good song. Why do they always play Wake Me Up When SeptemberEnds so much on the radio? That song is too slow.Everyone buys too many of these. What is the point.Soon a bigger bang from the Stones will be just likethis. Haha!!!!!"
1,THESE GUYS HELPED TURN PUNK ROCK INTO A POP TREND AND IF YOU BOUGHT ANY OF THEIR ABLUMS YOU HELPED THEM,"its shameful to be a kid these days with pop junk like this being called not only punk but hardcore punk (is the backsteet boys hard rock?) i agree with that one reviewer-if you want to know what real punk rock truely sounds like in all of its raw, hardcore form then listen to the sex pistols album -Never Mind the Bollocks Here's the Sex Pistols- or listen to any sex pistols album and then if you cant handle that stop calling your self a punk rocker ok?-if you want to be a pop loving teeny boper fine just dont take us down with you"
2,Big letdown.,"Hello, I just turned 16, so growning up I listened to greenday and blink 182 and the like. My taste is music has changed greatly since then. And well im not sure whats goin on with greenday, this album is not very good, pure bubble gum pop punk. Greendays deffinetly changed. And am I mistaken or did they add a whole new member to the band? I was watching a video and I could have sword they had 4 members, correct me if im wrong. I dont see many old fans liking this stuff, They were punkish before, with 2 - 4 minute songs and such, but this cd has 9 minute ballads. Go pick up London Calling by the clash if you want to hear this style of music done right, dont even bother with this garbage. And come on, they've gotta be like 35 or 40 now, and they're wearing all black with makeup and a tie, erm, whats up?"
4,Green Day's Swansong.,"Alright- this album rocks, no way around that, but what really kills it for me is that it's too damn political.If I've learned anything AT ALL about music, it's that politics and music DO NOT MIX.I can't even begin to list off the HUGE amounts of incredible artists that got too political and went downhill from there, Roger Waters is the supreme example of that, I think, one minute he's world famous with Shine on you Crazy Diamond, the next minute, nobody knows his name, and his songs are ten minute long bitchfests.Alright- Green Day is a great little band, this is a great little Cd, one of thier best, actually, and I couldn't love it anymore if I tried, but whare to go from here?1. Green Day continues political songwriting and ends up like Roger Waters.2. Green day goes back to normal, but never regains the enraged passion that American Idiot had.Things are not looking good for Green Day, methinks."
3,GREEN GAY!!!,"Green Day is a musically talented band. Every song on this album, musically, is excellent. The only problem is...THEY'RE TOTAL SELLOUTS, MAN! Instead of paying the same amount of money you would have payed THE DAY THE CD CAME OUT why don't you go steal your neighbors CD and burn their copy, eh?"
2,So-So cd,"My friend gave me this cd to listen to and I have to admit I liked some of the songs. ""Whatshername"" and ""Wake me up when September Ends"" are still my two favorites. But, I tried playing some of their songs on guitar,but got bored because they just keep repeating the same power chords over and over throughout the whole cd. I'm not bashing Green Day, I just think they could have done a better job."
1,BEST ALBUM EVER.,"Please ignore the title.Green Day had two good albums:""1039 / Smoothed Out Slappy Hours""and ""Kerplunk.""The others were decent, but not something I would really ever listen to. This is complete trash. Billy Joe spouts off about how much he hates corporate America, and then I turn on MTV and there he is, either being interviewed or playing on a video. The album, supposedly, is an attack on the state of America, yet, from what I see, the ones listening are the rich teeny boppers who used mommy and daddy's money to buy this trash.The lyrics on ""American Idiot"" are vague and uninteresting, especially on the hit single ""Blvd. of Broken Dreams."" The music itself is the same Green Day music we've been hearing for ten years. Come on, boys, do something new.If this is political punk than Celine Dion is early DC hardcore. Listen to Bad Brains, Agnostic Front, or Fugazi."
3,greenday is still greenday,"come on. these reviews on amazon are comparing greenday with pink floyd, foo fighters? i would not put them in that catagory myself. i have greenday's superhits album, and thats all i'll ever own of theirs. they have some good sounding songs, but most of their songs don't show the emotion other better bands put into their music. i think bands such as SUBLIME and STP will (would have) always have more passion than greenday when it comes to their music. i remember the first time i listened to greenday. my friend in elemetary school liked them and so we listened to them. that was about nine years ago. they belong on the radio, not in my music album. go thrice"
3,Green Day review,"This CD is okay. I like the older Green Day music better... but it's all in all a good CD...american idiot is kinda offensive, but its really okaybtw, if u see that is has a parental advisory, its really not that bad, it says fag a few times, F*ck maybe once... but thats really it (they go way too far with these stickers nowadays(~Erin"
4,Punk Rock Opra?,"My brother was a big fan back in the days of their album 'Dookie' and I remember hearing them every time I was in the car with him. But this new release by Green Day has shown that that generation has grown from the ripped jeans and 'skate or die' motto to the blue-collar working man who hates his boss and wants to be a kid again.In this album, it tells a story like theme of a teenager who is tired of the same old crap that is every day life and follows a dreamer named St. Jimmy who is also known as the Jesus Of Suburbia.I loved the album in it's self and the image that it plays in my mind. So I hope you also will enjoy this album as much as I did."
3,I actually kind of enjoyed it....,"I used to listen to the older Green Day CD's but moved on to more hardcore music. As someone who listens to bands like Leftover Crack, Black Flag, and Minor Threat I found this CD to be somewhat enjoyable. There's a lot of pop but there is some punk to be found as well. Kinda catchy and acsessible I think the problem is they got way too much media attention. All in all if it wasn't played on the radio 24/7 I don't think so many people would hate Green Day. Oh and to all those idiots whinning about how great classic rock bands (Led Zep, Iron Maiden ect)are: You and your music suck.Bottom Line: If your just getting into punk start with Green Day, otherwise though you can probably find something better."
4,Okay so it's not punk.....,"So many reviewers here state that this record sucks because it's not punk. Well, duh. I have a brilliant observation: it's not polka either. How about if we take this for what it is: good, fun pop music with a healthy dose of left-wing politics. It is a damn fine record.PS it's not New Age Country Waltz music either. In case you were wondering."
4,Question:,"Hey, kids. You're digging some decent rock music in the form of this album. Good for you. So why do you keep supporting all of that other crap they play a million times on the radio? Try switching the dial to something other than that Top 40 station you're always listening to.I thought Green Day had the potential to start a mini-revolution by hooking all the young guys and gals onto rock 'n' roll again. Guess I was wrong. Sad, really."
2,not their best,"really... i've been a green day fan ever since their beginnings in 1988, and this album is not their best. not only is there slow emo songs like 'boulevard of broken dreams', 'wake me up when september ends', and 'we are the waiting', but it sounds less punk than ever.there are a few good songs that can satisfy: 'holiday', 'st. jimmy', 'she's a rebel', 'letterbomb', and 'homecoming'... but that's about it. if anything, you might want to get those from itunes or something.if want a good green day album, try one of the first four: '1039/smoothed out slappy hours', 'kerplunk', 'dookie' (my personal favorite), and 'insomniac', they're MUCH better than this one."
5,GREEN DAY ROCKS!!!,"Green Day's American Idiot album is, I think, the best album in history! The song American Idiot is such a good introduction into the punk opera. The songs like Are We the Waiting, Boulevard of Broken Dreams, and Wake Me Up When September Ends also create a more peaceful mood for those who don't enjoy loud, true, punk rock. Over all, this is THE BEST Green Day album so far."
4,Great album for new listeners to Green Day,"If you're still stuck on the days of Dookie and crave that era of music from them, then this may not be the album for you. But I say you should still buy it. Why? Because of track #10: Letterbomb. It's old-school classic Green Day at their best and makes this album worth it with just that song. Even if you don't like the rest, you'll still be somewhat happy.If you're a new listener to Green Day and you've heard them on the radio, buy this album! It's the best pop-rock album of 2004 and I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Many classic sing-a-longs and head shakers.Although it's not the 'punk' that Green Day was once known for it's a good buy for just about anyone who likes rock."
5,It's me again.,"Green Day is NOT pop! True, with the album WARNING, they came dangerously close to it, but THEY ARE NOT POSERS OR POP!!!!! I'll bet you anything that if they released this on a MINOR label, like LOOKOUT or EPITAPH, EVERYONE would worship it! But no, they think ""if it's not on a minor label, it's not punk"" which can be true, but that is not the case with GREEN DAY.Now, Hawthorne Hieghts.... hmm, let me see.... POP!Taking Back Sunday...... POP!!!!!(and poser)Yeah, so, think about the bands YOU like and if THEY are posers or pop before you be so ignorant as to say Green Day is.Thank You.P.S. Taking Back Sunday is just horrible!!!!!! How can you stand them?"
3,pretty good................. or not,"Ok, so I really like Green Day, they always come up with great music and catchy lyrics and so I like this album although I don't really agree with a lot of the messages it's sending. Its pretty unpatriotic, I mean just be happy to live in America! But anyway, if you just don't obsess over the fact that they're not totally patriotic and they're anti-bush and just focus on the music then definitely get the CD. And if you're anti-bush yourself then you have to be sure to get it!!!!!!!!!!!! :) I for one don't really care. It's not my view, but its a view and Green Day has their right to express their view. And if they're going to express it, then I really appreciate that they express it using great music!!! (Oh, and right now, as I write this I'm listening to Boulevard of Broken Dreams)"
5,Awesome!,"Okay, first of all, to all of you people who hate this CD because you believe that their political beliefs are ""quote"" WRETCHED ""unquote"" that is the most idiotic reason ever. You don't have to agree with them to love their music.To the person who says that this was a big story thing, that's exactly what I thought. I thought that I was the only one who noticed that! :)Now on to the review. My personal favorites are American Idiot, Jesus of Suburbia, Holiday, Boulevard of Broken Dreams, Novacaine, Extrodinary Girl, Letterbomb, and Wake me Up when September ends. Wow, that almost the whole CD! But all of the songs are great! My dad even loves Green Day now! And just because they've changed doesn't meen they still rock. This is their best CD, and my favorite CD that I own. Definetly get it, be open minded. :)"
4,not bad,"the trax on this album aren't bad songs. it's just that the album tends to go on and on. i think if they cut it in half and just had the first half of songs on this record, then it could be considered a ""good"" release. and for all those pepole that said that Green Day hasn't changed over the years......how long have they been around? they haven't changed their music because their fans like them just the way they are."
5,The best album of the year,"When I purchased American Idiot about a month ago I honestly didn't listen to it that much at first. Of course I knew the singles ""America Idiot"" and ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"" but I didn't take the time to sit down and really listen to the CD, however when I finally did I was literally blown away. I'm not going to sit and critique each track, but I am going to say that Idiot is the best album I've purchased in years. Each track has an original and unique sound to it. The group is in top form musically and one can almost feel the passion that lead singer Billie Joe puts into each song. I love this album and would highly recommend it to anyone."
5,Great Purchase,"Green Day is back to their old roots (not to say I didn't love Warning) with their new single American Idiot. It's a pure punk rock anthem with great drums a strong message and an addictive chorus. Kerrang said Green Day have rarely sounded this good; I'd say they've never sounded so good.Too Much Too Soon is a good rock 'n roll song with Green Day's punk rock vibe pumped into it. The lyrics are not political and go back to old Green Day (""Now it sucks to be you""...""I hope you rest in peices"") Very cool song.I've also heard the song Letterbomb from American Idiot (the album) and I can't wait to hear what Kerrang calls ""Green Day's Masterpiece."""
5,Great album,"Holiday/Boulevard Of Broken Dreams (8:13) starts as quite an anthem, kind of an old-school punk beat which transform its experience into a Holiday. Roughly mid song it switches tone and takes a full turn into a different somewhat whiney, pissed off song (one I recognize from the radio or something). With the song changing abruptly, I still can't figure out why it's on the same track, but that's what makes this album such a great spin. Track 3 (9:08mins), fantastically called `Jesus Of Suburbia', also morphs into different tones and feelings throughout the unusually long song. Billie Joe is really trying to either fix his ADD or show it off? I've got three levels: Great, Good, and Ok and this album is Great."
1,"""Another elitist, one-star review""","This is not forced, pseudo-iconoclasticism. Pre-packaged faux-angst and political posturing laid out over a pitifully predictable pop-punk soundscape of power chords and a bass-snare bass-snare rhythm section is not good music.This album sucks as much as the above sentence is run-on. This review won't get any ""yes"" votes because I'm not worshipping American Idiot as the ""rock opera"" it's not, so I'll leave it at this: If Green Day met a real band like Gorgoroth or Dissection, there'd be a boulevard of broken necks.- Thus says the Pellington"
1,"where is our taste, decency, and sense of geometry?","anyone who thinks this album was groundbreaking should turn off MTV and educate themselves as to what a sellout is. i used to enjoy their music, but this was simply just a commercial success. there is nothing melodic or original about their music. if they put as much time into writing and performing good music as they do putting on makeup and selling there songs to yahoo music, they may be able to create something tolerable. they represent our society and it's decadent taste in music. we no longer want to think, we just want some easy-to-digest, emotionless crap that allows us to drive and talk on our cell phones while we listen to it...god save the queen (and our taste in music)"
5,Awsome!,"Green Day has really done it this time! Their new punk rock album is great! Don't listen to those who say that Green Day's music is trash! They're completely wrong, trust me. ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"" is probably the best song on the album, and it's an amazing song! They manage to put major and minor notes to create a supurb tune, and the lyrics are great. I also recommend ""American Idiot"". Even though it isn't very patriotic, it's a great song with a fabulouse melody. This is probably their best record so far. I strongly recommend this album. It's worth every penny!"
2,The album that unfortunatly changed the music industry for the worst,"Green Day has always been somewhat of an oddity, not quite pop but not quite punk either. Earlier efforts such as Dookie and Insomnia showed promise for the rising tide of Pop-Punk bands in the late '90's. Yet this album is a question mark to the genre. Pop-Punk was meant to be fun catchy and stupid but intellectualizing and politizing the genre made it seem that it was in its dying days. Somehow this album instead revitalized it Lables are signing Emo-Pop bands left and right indie has been compramised to an extent and Punk is all but dead. While i enjoy early Green Day I condem them for doing the unspeakable to indie and punk music C+"
1,Let's see,"I've read a lot of people saying that this s GD's best album. Yes, of course it's their best album, and maybe Jimi Hendrix is still alive, he's just living as a monk in the himalayas. Cotton Hell and wheelchair Assassin are right. Go buy anything by GD up to Nimrod and ignore anything after that. As for people sayin this is the 'best CD of 2004', go buy 'The System Has Failed"" by Megadeth and tell me what's the best album of 2004!"
3,"cool, but not as good as it could have been","Green Day's newest release, ""American Idiot"" has many things to please both old and new fans. The title track boasts such politically incorrect phrases as ""Now listen to the sound of the stereo The subliminal mind- f*ck America"". However, once you get past track 1, there isn't much good stuff left on the CD. There are some songs that you just know are going to go big (and some already have, like the ballad ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"" and the thought-provoking ""Wake Me Up When September Ends"") and there are a few songs that sound cool (i.e. ""Jesus of Suburbia"" and ""Give Me Novocaine"") but there isn't much other than that. ""American Idiot"", I thought, was going to be an album I would keep listening to. Boy was I wrong."
2,SELLOUTS!!!,"When i first heard this album, I agreed with many of you, that it was incredible. But then, after ""Boulivard of Broken Dreams"" was played non stop on the radio for 3 months, i realized, ""What is Billie Joe talking about?"" He doesn't walk a lonely road, he's a freakin rockstar! The song was obviously written for young, stupid fools to drool over. Also, with ""Wake me up when September ends"", why does he care that summer is ending, again, he's a rockstar, he doesn't have to go back to school or anything."
1,"Umm...No, not for me.","Green Day...Is like a band that thinks they are all cool, and punk and skater. Yeah, ok...Not. They are like emo. Which means Emotional. Which sucks. I'm sorry. I hate all of their songs. And I'm sooo glad I didn't but there albums or any of them because all of their songs that I've heard stink also. I would not recommend you but this album. I didn't.(I'm sooo glad)...Oh yeah, I only gave it one star because that was the least amount of stars there were. I wish there were 0, but thats ok. They need all the help they can get."
5,best album from green day so far,this album is so amazingand the bets track on this album is got to be boulevard of broken dreams and ameriacan idoit this one of green days more rock albums than punk album im so glad i got this album for last christmass
2,Get back to where you belong!!!,"I think its about time ""Green Day"" got back to where they belong.Dookie and Insomniac their first records (forget the other two before that) were proper rock/punk guitar albums, with grungy riffs (particularly Insomniac) - revoluntionary albums.Then along came Nimrod, good album something different, but Green Day did'nt carry on making the catchy hard rocking cool riffed music they were good at, they made ""WARNING"" a piece of commercial crap as it turned out, and heres more of it.AMERICAN IDIOT sounds way to manufactured compared with Insomniac or Dookie.Get back to making the music that you made you who you were, and who you should be.AMERICAN IDIOT is lacking the punch that their other albums have. (Dookie and Insomniac)and won't stand the test of time.Let hope for better things next time."
1,why do people buy this crap???,"I don't get it, enough is enough. Green Day is best described as simple, no talent, metrosexuals trying to sell millions of cd's. good job idiots, you fooled the masses. Seriously listen to Sonic Youth, Fugazi, or even the Killers if you want good pop rock."
1,"""crap"" is what i put in the search","i just searched for ""crap"" on amazons search for all products and this is the first one that came up. I thought this bad was british until i saw them on the telly and realised they themselves are american idiots. this album was part of the wave of bands going mainstream with the popular political oppinion. and band that does that is not very good indeed."
1,GREEN DAY SUCKS AND YOUR ALL PATHETIC,"Too bad there wasnt a 0 star choice because Greenday is one of the worst bands ever made. If you little emo kids think these guys are punk then please, go kill yourself now and save our world from being filled with poseurs. This album is a waste of time, and these guys are useless in music and at life. YOu people who think Greenday is punk most likely shop at Greenday and buy Anarchy shirts with no clue wtf it is. **** you all and good riddance(by the way, a horrible greenday song, oh wait, their all horrible)."
1,I HATE THIS!!!!,"I borrowed this cd from someone and as I listened to it I realized that I HATE anything considered ""pop-punk""...so go ahead and buy this cd...BUT I suggest that yousave your money for a GOOD band,not one that lost all its talent after a few years...(I also didn't like dookie alot but SOME was good)"
2,....huh?,"What the hell is the big deal about this album? Its Greenday, but its not the Greenday I grew up loving. The edge is gone and in its place are bland pop riffs and well...everything that I was glad Greenday didn't succumb to before this album.It is mixed and produced well? Yes. Does that make up for its bland sound? NO."
3,Sellouts,"The artist may say Green Day, but this is not a Green Day Album. Sounds more to me like Good charlotte or one of those new 12 year old girl type punk bands. I saw some people say this is ""old school"" Green Day. They are wrong. That is not opinion, it is fact. This is not old school Green Day. I gave it 3 stars because its still decent, but I wouldnt even consider it a Green Day album. Green Day died after Insomniac. We can call this... Green Day II"
2,American Idiot,"What happend? Did you decide to go mainstream and have all these people being posers wear green day shirts but only know american idiot or better yet, dont even know that and just think youre hot? You know why you won a grammy right? Theres a bunch of posers who voted you.HEY I gotta good idea! how bout you play stuff like you did on dookie! That was awesome and it DID sell.. You decided to release an album that would sell , but like dookie didnt? Shure I used to love this album but now i find how stupid it was because of that."
3,Pretty good,This wuz an ok CD. The only songs that i like r American Idiot another one that i don't even now how 2 spell.
1,Green Day < Turd Smokers,American Idiot is a result of a record company using a succesful band as Money Making machines. Green Day = $$$$$$$ according to The Producers and Company. Fans = $$$$$$. Green Day are trendsters Like FOB and AAR.
1,HORRIBLE,I did not know that any other band could make music as bad as Linkin Park's. American Idiot proved me wrong.
1,What happened to Green Day?,"I could give you all about a thousand reasons why this album is politically and morally backwards, but I'd rather just rate the music. It's boring, and unoriginal. They weren't making that big a statement (everyone else on TV hates George W.Bush anyways, so it's not that rebellious), and are trying to brainwash the youth to their own political mistakes, oops, I mean, beliefs (ha ha). This album is not a classic, and it's deffinately not punk rock (punk rock is a 70's and 80's genre that died because of bands like this). I personally think that there was a much more well-written album that was made about a year before this one, and it was from a much better band (AFI's Sing the Sorrow). That album should be considered a classic. I remember Green Day's first big album; Dookie. It had much better songwriting and was more unique. Don't buy this album! EVER!"
1,Wish I could go below one star,"Green Day are amongst the most overrated bands of recent times and their music is awful and sucks.They are just another BOY BAND with instruments and I cant understand why people like them and their crappy music.Avoid this idiotic album.Green day sucks and will always suck.I recommend these albums insteadABBEY ROAD-THE BEATLESPARANOID-BLACK SABBATHPHYSICAL GRAFFITI-LED ZEPPELINTHE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON-PINK FLOYDMACHINE HEAD-DEEP PURPLEWHEELS OF FIRE-CREAMWHO'S NEXT-THE WHOQUADROPHENIA-THE WHOTONS OF SOBS-FREEGRAND FUNK-GRAND FUNK RAILROADON TIME-GRAND FUNK RAILROADONE MORE FROM THE ROAD-LYNYRD SKYNYRDFOGHAT LIVE-FOGHATPERFORMANCE AT THE FILLMORE-HUMBLE PIEFRAMPTON COMES ALIVE-PETER FRAMPTONABRAXAS-SANTANAGREEN DAY ARE JUNK,LED ZEPPELIN ARE GREAT."
1,Green day for babies?????,"Wow,I just cant believe that anyone could like this horrible band.The lead singer Billy joe is terrible and sings horribly and they sound more like a boy band.Boluevard of broken dreams and wake me when september ends must surely be the worst songs ever made and this album is as bad as warning.Ignore the five star reviews and stay away from cd's by Nirvana,Green day who are trash and only meant for babies."
1,A disgrace,"Green Day and this album is a disgrace to the rock world. Buy some Rolling Stones records from the 70s and LISTEN TO some REAL rock music, Not this trash."
2,Crud.,"I've always hated this band... ultimately trite pop music in spite of their anti-hero garage image. There was a time when people appreciated musicianship even in mainstream music, and had an attention span that lasted longer than three chords. I think Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree sang it best... ""Music of the future will not entertain, It's only meant to repress and neutralize your brain."""
1,Greenday's name gone down the drain.,What happened to greendays oldschool songs? This is a complete disgrace to greenday and all true Greenday fans HATE this album!
2,Pure crap,"Wow these guys have gone soft. This album is basically a soft rock album , skip this one and listen to there old stuff."
1,GREEN DAY ARE SO OVERRATED!!!!!!!,"How come people love this band so much? For some reason, they are so overrated and Punk Rock is just weak. Even Boulevard ofBroken Dreams is bad! Don't listen to this as it sucks!! Listento these bands insted, GREEN DAY SUCKS!!!!!!!Aerosmith,Beatles, Bruce Springsteen, Dire Straits, Foghat, Foreigner,Guns N' Roses, Joe Walsh, Led Zeppelin, Neil Young, Nirvana, The Rolling Stones, & Tom Petty.Green Day, Ramones, and Metallica all suck!!!"
1,JUNK,"WOW,I CANT IMAGINE ANYONE PRAISING THIS AWFUL ALBUM.EACH AND EVERY SONG IS A TURD AND I WAS SURPRISED THAT THEY WON A GRAMMY WHEN THEY ARE MORE DESERVING BANDS LIKE THE ROLLING STONES STILL OUT THERE.AVOID THIS AND GET STICKY FINGERS FROM THE ROLLING STONES INSTEAD.PS:GREEN DAY ARE AS BAD AS FOREIGNER AND NIRVANA.AVOID THEIR ALBUMS AND IGNORE METALLICA ROCKS REALLY HARD."
1,nice niche you've captured greenday,"greenday fanatics are nothing but wannabe punks / anti-establishment wannabe-rebels... they all fall withing the age range of 13 - 21.is it just me or does greenday suck? like most of the music youths and societal parasites (who will supposedly be our ""future"") listen to, greenday represents all that is degenerate in our society. its popularity and critical acclaim is merely representing the levels decadence.the hypocrisy is frightening! its nauseating! even the albums title ""american idiot"" contradicts their promotion of pop culture and consumerism. boy... talk about the ingenious evil corporate strings attached to these poor fools (green day and fans)- The Evil Kid"
1,Overated!!!,"Green Day is way overated. The songs on this cd are nothing extraordinary. If you want to listen to real rock, get Contraband by Velvet Revolver. Contraband has much better songs."
3,"Great music, stupid copyright protection.","The album's great, but if you principally play music on your PC you're in for a rude suprise. In order to prevent piracy, I presume, the publisher has choosen to prevent legitimate buyers from being able to listen to their own CD on a CD-ROM drive. Cute. Here's a novel idea, punish the music pirates, not your legitimate customers!"
2,"Mediocre single, but from a great album.","Even if you don't like this single, I encourage you to get the American Idiot album; this single is unrepresentative of the album itself, which is undoubtedly one of the year's best albums to me.The single, although fun, is too cookie-cutter for me. The same distorted riffs get played over and over, but I appreciate the lyrics and the message of the song; one highly appropriate for the times we live in.I'd just wait for the American Idiot album. You can get it if you know where to look right now, but I'll be one of the first to buy it when it comes out in a week."
5,Perfect Rock Album,"Green Day's style has obviously gone more mainstream. So if you're a punk fan elitist, you'll hate this album. I'm not a Bush supporter so I think the concept is great. But even putting politics aside, it's handsdown one of the best rock albums of the year - right up there with Velvet Revolver. There's a lot of emotion and effort put into the song writing and it shows. Just about every song will get stuck in your head as it's just as catchy as Dookie.My favorite tracks so far are Jesus of Suburbia (9 min), She's a Rebel and Letterbomb. I can't stop listening to this album!"
5,NOT EDITED,If you are wondering if this is edited it isn't. This is just the version they sell in Europe ( In Europe they don't have to put warnings on cd's for bad lyrics.)
5,WAYYY better than I thought it would be!!,"This cd is definitely one of the best punk cds out this year, and most likely THE best. This, in my opinion, is Green Day's best work so far. There are some hard rocking songs on this cd (American Idiot, St. Jimmy, Holiday,...) and there are some softer, more mellow Time of your Life type songs (Wake Me uP When September ends, Boulevard of Broken Dreams). But definitely my new favorite cd. I think anyone who likes Green Day, or even just punk in general should buy this cd without a second thought. Oh and just a note, there aren't 21 songs on the cd, #2 and #12 are broken into different parts (it's hard to explain until you've heard it for yourself.) SO GO BUY IT AND HEAR FOR YOURSELF!!!!!!!!!"
5,what!?!?!?,"I don't know what the other reviewer was talking about, but Green Day is played all over the radio in the states and they are REALLY huge. I don't know of anyone objecting to their music being played even if they don't like what they're saying. There is definately no problem obtaining it in the ""current political climate."" In any event, it is true that this album really kicks you know what. I completely recommend it!!!"
3,PUH-LEEEASSSEE!!!!!!!,"honestly, these guys were pretty cool and f@@@ing awesome when they started out. now these guys are too mainstream and are effected musically because of it. i keep things honest and i have no dobut that if they lived like the amish for the few months they had off before writing this record, i assure you that it would be the album of the year. to put it simply, it still sounds good, but it could be soooooooooo much better. SEACREST OUT!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,good stuff-old style,"I like this album a lot. But for people new to Green Day, I think that some of their older songs are better, such as Basket Case, Brain Stew, and Minority. You can find those songs on the album International Superhits. Don't get me wrong. I like American Idiot, Jesus of Suburbia, and Boulevard of Broken Dreams. But I think their old stuff is a little better."
4,great but missing something....,"this cd is great but it does'nt sound like the old green day i know. they have good songs on there like american idiot,boulave of broken dreams,jeaus surburb(number 2)back to realety,but i've never heard green day like this i known green day for 6 or 7 years and they don't sound alike its like they got a new singer but still green day is good."
4,Green Day - American Idiot CD,"This wasn't a purchase for myself. It was a gift for someone else. I'm told that it arrived on-time and in good condition. So, everyone is very happy! Thanks!"
3,"Almost, But not quite","Now I like rock an Alt.rock, and you got to admit this is pretty good music, but i've only heard about half of the songs. SOme are long and upbeat, some are slow waith a little rock, but ALMOST EVERY (if not every) SONG CUSSES. Overall, its prety good, but don't get it unless your like at least 12 or something"
2,Heard Better Before,"Maybe it's because I am not a big fan of punk rock, or maybe the CDs just bad. Greenday can't write good lyrics it's like they just threw in some words and voila! The CD is the worst one I have, but songs like Holiday and Boulevard of Broken Dreams are pretty good"
4,A good buy!,American Idiot delivers a good mix of mainstream (top 40) along with a tinge of alternative style music. The majority of the CD is worth a listen with definite distinction between tracks.
2,Rip off Artists,"I agree with the earlier posts that Jesus of Suburbia totally rips off ""Summer of 69""...then it gets worse...It rips off a country song...(I read the graffiti,In the bathroom stall,Like the holy scriptures in a shopping mall) sounds suspiciously similar to Kenny Chesney's ""Good Stuff"". What a joke!"
1,"Green Day, Never the same again.","When I first heard that Green Day was releasing a new album last September I was ecstatic. But one day before school in mid-September before the album's release I was watching MTV and saw the new American Idiot video. Something inside me died that morning. I was very disappointed in the song and the video. It simply was not Green Day. I have been a huge Green Day fan for three years. They are one of my all time favorite bands. Sure Green Day has not been the Green Day I love since the release of 1997's Nimrod. But this was an all time low. Sure I can add the songs Holiday, St. Jimmy, and Give Me Novacaine to my long list of Green Day songs I like. But as a whole this album was my least favorite."
1,Oh dear....Another victim of the MTV generation,"I've been a fan of greenday since I was in 3rd grade(about 11 years ago now) and have been ever since. Now to see them wearing hot topic style uniforms, eyeliner, 6 grammys, preforming alongside the likes of ashlee simpson, and a sleu of new Kiddy pop punk fans(thanks to MTV and mainstream radio theyre everyones fav band now you didn't hear sh#t about them a year ago) And lyrics that sound like they were written by a 14 year old suburban white kid. It truly breaks my heart. Welcome to the machine guys."
1,WAKE UP SELLING OUT ISNT ABOUT WHAT LABEL YOUR ON ITS ABOUT WHAT MUSIC YOU MAKE,"who cares what label the sex pistols are on atleast they didnt go pop (and pop isnt about how many people buy your album its about its about making bland, chachy, sugur sweet music to try to get them to buy it)and greenday didnt only do that this album but with EVERY albumBOTTOM LINE- THE SEX PISTOLS ARE STILL TRUE TO THE MUSIC AND GREENDAY NEVER WASAND STOP WATCHING TRL ITS THE RESON THAT YOU DONT REALIZE THIS"
1,green day,"this is one of the worst cds ever made, ever!! Why do people likethis so much? check out foreigner, dire straits, and guns n' roses insted. nevermind by nirvana is another overatted rock album. This is even worse. songs such as Girl On The Moon, ColdAs Ice, Heavy Fuel, Skateaway, Sultans of Swing, Money for Nothing, Walk of Life, Solid Rock, Romeo and Juliet, Tunnel ofLove, Lady Writer, Down to the Waterline, Calling Elvis, The Bug,Expresso Love, Telegraph Road, Industrial Disease, So Far Away,Brothers in Arms, Welcome to the Jungle, Sweet Child O' Mine,Paradise City, Patience, Live and Let Die, November Rain, DontCry, Civil War, Yesterdays, Knockin on Heavens Door, & You CouldBe Mine are all better songs. This sucks!!!"
2,it is fake,"This album has some technically good songs with catching melodies;but one thing that bugged me is that most of the emotions given through the songs are fake.Their first single from this album i guess,the boulevard of broken dreams;has some really artificial and silly lyrics.it is supposed to be lonelyness;but the lyrics are so fake,so simple and cliche that you hardly believe that the vocalist had ever really felt them.Technically,it is a great album but in spirit;it is just some populer teenage boys singing about things they dont have the smallest idea about,things like solitude and misery.They fake emotions to be popular among teenagers,and they do it so well, but they are not enough to fool some decent listener who ever listened something real about gothic sadness."
2,2 Cuz I'm nice...,"Im not seeing the revolution here. Generally, this is the same stuff. Not as much of it, but still... THE SAME. Theres a few minor changes, really, i mean GEESE. Their single, Bouelavard of Broken Dreams, is one example of something different. OK, just ok, thats all it is. And it gets tiring after being played as much as every other blink 182 type pop-punk wonder. This litterely boars me. Music is not meant to boar. Music is not meant 2 b the same exact power chords played over and over. This is not energy or ""punk rock"" its unoriginality. The dope'll only crate songs for you for so long. Go find something with some spark 2 listen 2."
3,Green Day - american idiot,"As a great Green Day fan of short, to the point, cynical, critical songs this album has many failings. Mainly in the fact that it covers all the points you would like but drags them out into a '70s epic album. Individually most of the songs are superb but run them together into a ""concept"" album and you have a cross of the Ramones and Rush. Each good in their own right but not entirely what you would want from Green Day. I would suggest you play the first and last tracks and forget alot of the stuff inbetween."
1,Come On!,Green day Hs been rocking the scenes for the last 10 years but i dont like them. Mike cannot play a guitar. They give him no solos and i can see why. In Holiday he starts with a solo but its 2 power chords. COME ON im 13 and i am probably the only one my age that absouletly cannot stand billies voice and the lyrics but i will give them the fact that tre is one h*** of a drummer.
3,Pretty good for a punk CD.,"OK, Im probably gonna make a lotta people mad by saying this but outside of Green day,Nirvana(if they count), and Blink 182, I HATE PUNK ROCK, mostly those good charlotte queers. I hate that life and death crap so good charlotte can go jump into a swamp with an aligator that eats them up just like they eat people's money up! Any way on to the review. This CD has a lot of good songs like american idiot, and shes a rebel, except that sound thats in all punk rock makes it so I can't love this CD, but its pretty good, and if you like this I reccomend 2 even better Green Day albums, Dookie, and Warning! So before you get this get those."
2,Blah Bland,"I went and just bought this CD! Its okay. Nothing spectacular, but redundant, same sounding songs!Best tracks:American IdiotWake ME Up When September EndsJesus of Seburbia"
2,bad,"this is definetly green days worst cd. They have become sell outs...they used to be so cool, they have ruined it. they have slapped there original fans in the face and now just write music for money. hopefully they figure out what they have done and go back to there old way."
2,Sorry -- I like punk music,Not a bad album unless you were expecting a punk band. Lets hope that Mike Ness and the boys do better next week.
1,JUNKMUSIC FROM THE JUNKMUSIC AGE,This kind of music is not good. This is pure ****! But thats ok. Whats not ok is that others thinks this is good music and buying this.
1,sellouts,"green day has stopped playing their music and has sold out to what is ""popular"" and what the music industry wants them to play. this album is very poppy and trendy which is not what green day used to be. if you want to listen to their good music listen to dookie or warning, but please, not this. they used to be one of my favorite bands but after i saw them with eye makeup, black clothing attire, and playing some of the most cheesy music i've heard, i changed my mind. the last thing we need is another pop/rock band wearing eye make-up polluting the airwaves. long live the old green day"
1,THE WORST THING EVER,i hate this band so much. there fan base is nothing more than all of those disposable stereotypical teenie boppers. die.
1,Pathetic...,"Just because you are famous doesn't mean you know anything about politics. Come to think of it, just because you sell records doesn't mean you know how to make music either."
1,Yawn...,"Never understood why everyone likes this so much. Average, common punk rock fed to the masses. So tired. I give it 1 star because Green Day used to be decent."
2,more of the same.,"Green Day is suffering from the U2 virus. Release the same album every couple of years but with diffrent lyrics. If you love Green Day to the point of crazyness then this album is for you, but if your looking for something new or diffrent, go try something else.Also some have said this album is ""political"" its not at all."
3,Not their best,"This is a big dissapointment. after seeing reviews that claimed this album was a masterpiece, i listened to it and it let me down. some songs are great (holiday) while others are horrendous (boulevard of broken dreams). overall the songs to me sound too alike and though this gives it a coherence tying along to the ""story"" it's just not very good. Ambitious but just not that good."
1,Green Day lame Attempt to be as Legandary as the Clash,I do not care how many albums Green Day Sales they will never be as good as the clash and i really do not like the Clash. In the American Idiot movie the spray themselves with green paint. This album has many pop hard rock songs like the clash. Plus Politics this is the main reason i hate this album if i wanted politics i would watch cnn i like my rock and roll fun not serious. I actually liked green day when on Dookie [...] if you like education is not needed green day sucks no but at least their music is not annoying(ei emo s****)
3,Fair,"I'am Not Usually Not A Big Fan Of Green Day. Really I Pretty Much Hate All Of There Album's. But For Some Reason I Actually Like This Album Ok. I Don't Know It's Like It's A Step Of Good For Green Day. It's Actually The Only Green Day Album I Own. I Proabably Recomend This One, But It's The Only One I Would."
1,Stay Away from the Dookie (no pun intented),"Now first off think about this. You are buying an album that is full of pop songs with a punk look. American Idiot is not a very good song and its being pushed on the public like mad. Its on the Madden Video game and MTV! AHHH! Do yourself a favor and stay away from Green Day and try actual punk albums from real punk bands. Try listening to some punk/ska bands like NOFX, Reel Big Fish, Operation Ivy, or Rancid. Those are very good bands and there are alot more."
1,Blah and Bland,its sad hat this musiq. is noticed wehn othre more talinted people are not. get sum real musiq like the Cheeta Gurls or The Chinderlla story soundtreck. get some real musiq licke. licke reale musiq. hillary duf rox! u all no that! u just deny. it. these are just wannabis! thye canet. even sing. they yell. they canet sign! ravin simone is better! way better. i mean way better. same wit birtney spirs and osher. get other stuff like. p.diddy. joe joe. fat joe. get linsey lohand.
2,"Decent Music, horrible message","Music wise this album is alright. Thats why it gets 2 stars.However, as one of the few people here who actually likes America I find that in these tmes making a song about what a craphole America is horrible taste. At the risk of preaching, I shall preach. This is the greatest country in the world and if you don't want to live in ""idiot America"" then don't. See how much you love ""Smart intelligent Cuba"""
5,Best Green Day album to date,"I'm not going to get technical here. This is just a sincere note to anyone out there contemplating the purchase of the CD. ""American Idiot"" is worth every single penny you may spend on it! Deep yet fun, all tracks in the album have that something special about them, and it is absolutely amazing how beautifully they all come together! What else can I say? I simply love this album!PS: I've been a Green Day fan for years but ""American Idiot"" seal the deal and made my love for them ""official"". :)"
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"That so many people find this an album to slobber over just scares the hell out of me. There is NOTHING unique, ground-breaking, or remotely interesting on this album that justifies the praise. This will stand the test of the month, but certainly not the test of time. This is not ""The Wall"" or ""Exile on Main Street"" or ""Abbey Road"" so everybody just calm down.Everyone that is giving this album five stars will praise it until they are ""blown away"" by the next Offspring or Blink 182 album.Go home."
1,Garbage,I guess after having the displeasure of hearing this the message is: You'd have to be an American idiot like the members of Green Day to like this.
2,dookie isnt their first album,dookie isnt their first album stop saying it is. its probably their best. anyway its ok but overpriced whiney and overplayed on the radio
3,Let's be objective here...,"I know that mainstream music is terrible. The current climate is what is leading people to believe that this album is some masterwork. It isn't. It's good, but it isn't great.Green Day basically re-wrote the songs on previous albums, with a common theme, and then threw in some tempo changes and a little continuity. They made no attempt to explore any new musical styles or sounds. This album is actually VERY mainstream in its production and sounds. If you look at the album credits, they used the same producers and mixers they have on virtually every other album. How can you say you are being experimental if you do everything by the old book?So what you have is a typical Green Day album with some character developement, links between songs, and tempo changes. That qualifies for brilliant these days?"
2,"If Any Green Day, I'm Going With The Old Stuff","I don't understand what everyone if freaking out about this album. I got it and it isn't very groundbreaking. If you want groundbreaking, go buy Slayer's ""Reign In Blood"" or Metallica's ""Master Of Puppets"".Anyways, alot of the songs on here are highly annoying (read: Wake Me Up When September Ends). This album also features alot of blindly political songs, like Holiday and American Idiot. Holiday doesn't even make sense. If you want an angery politically charged album you are looking at the wrong place. Go to Metallica's ""...And Justice For All"" or any Rage Against The Machine album."
5,I Love This Album,"I Love This Album, I Think it's really thought out and has alot of meaning. I first heard boulevard of broken dreams on the radio and imediately fell in love with it. I have a huge, and ever-growing CD collection but American Idiot remains one of my favorites. It has hardly left my CD player. Each song is different and passionate and gives you feelings that range from bitter sweet to wanting to jump up and down. Every emotion is packed in."
4,good but gets old,"i fell in love with this album when it came out but after hearing so many of these songs over and again, i started to get tired of it. i can barely listen to any of the singles from this album like american idiot or holiday. but some of the other songs like give me novacaine and whatshername are fun to listen to from time to time. its definitely not as bad album by any means, but the radio killed this one for me and many others."
3,Not bad...but not what I had hoped for...,"Well, after many years of simple punk rock music that Green Day has put out and been very successful with, this album sure is a change. I don't particularly care for it because it sounds so much different than previous albums. Now this doesn't mean the album is bad. The music is still very well written and organized and I don't not like any of the songs. It is just somewhat of a disappointment to me because Green Day's previous music has been totally awesome ever since their beginning, and now they have almost completely abandoned their punk reputation. Overall though, not a bad CD, but if you are a Green Day fan from only listening to American Idiot, and have never heard any of their earlier music, I strongly reccommend listening to the first five albums, 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours, Kerplunk, Dookie, Insomniac, and Nimrod, if you want to get a true impression of this band."
2,Meh,"At first, I really liked the single ""American Idiot"" and ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"" and then ""Holiday."" After hearing them so often on the radio, I got sick of them. I did not like ""Wake Me Up When September Ends."" I thought that song seemed to drone on and on.After hearing those songs, I decided to not buy it, but go to the library and pick it up and listen first, which I'm glad I did. I only found a few tracks off of the whole cd that were decent.I don't have much to say, but if you were a big fan of Dookie, you're going to be let down with this album. Greenday has completly changed their style of music."
2,lets run this one through the crapper,"puhleese! this album is a shame to green day and all of their previous albums. american idiot is not their best work in fact it doesn't even sound like the green day i know and love. this is not a five star album its elementary in everything that makes it up. the music, the vocals THE SONGS IN GENERAL. a complete dissappointment-"
1,Why Can't We Select Zero Stars?,That is what this piece of crap deserves. Worst album of 2004 by far of 3 wimps that were never anything close to punk. This crap is for weak all American middle class wussies who can't think of anything real to complain about.
1,GREEN DAY ARE TRASH,"GREEN DAY ARE THE WORST OF THE WORST.ANYONE WHO LIKES THEM NEEDS THERAPY.BILLIE JOE THEIR VOCALIST USES MAKE UP LIKE A GIRL JUST CANT SING AND THEIR GUITARING PLAIN SUCKS.DONT LISTEN TO THE FIVE STAR REVIEWERS,GREEN DAY ARE TERRIBLE.WHERE AS LED ZEPPELIN ARE THE GREATEST WITH A GREAT VOCALIST LIKE PLANT AND A GREAT GUITARIST IN JIMMY PAGE.AVOID THIS GREEN DAY NONSENSE AND GET ALBUMS FROM GREAT BANDS LIKE LED ZEPPELIN,THE BEATLES,ROLLING STONES AND THE WHO."
3,what did you say,"I can't understand them. My daughter likes them, I don't care for them.I personally think they are a bunch of ""wanna bees"" who sound like a swarm of bees. But my kid likes them, thank god for head phones."
1,Boring,"American Idiot by Green Day the album everyone used to love but now lots of people hate because it all sounds the same like every other new band around, its just guys with spiked hair singing about how much they hate america. Bassicly if you hate america you'll like this album but thats not why im giving it one star. Im giving it that low rating because this album sucks. Go for Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band for some actullay good music. Dont waste 13[..] on this album."
1,"people, stop reviewing this item so much!!","this item sucks SO BAD!! Why do people like this CD, this CD never won a lot of god damn awards. The only good song is Boulevard of Broken Dreams!! People, stop buying this thing somuch!! Mabye in the next 10 years, it wont be popular anymore."
2,Does Lita Ford ring a bell?,"I don't know how well you know 80s hair metal, or if you've ever heard of the Runaways, but when their guitarist Lita Ford went solo she released a self-titled album which featured a song called ""Broken Dreams"" which is probably where these sad sad guys go the idea for that song ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams."" It's a shame to see these fellows create such a horrible rip-off stinking pop throw-up. They sound much better when they aren't trying to get all political on everyone, maybe you remember a song a song they also stole entilted ""Knowledge,"" which included the lyrics ""all I know is that I don't know nothing."" Please Green Day, return to the immature true punk fashion of old and not this garbage."
1,I LOVE Green Day,"hello! I'm a 16 years old emo kid, I don't like green day cuz they're too heavy for me. But one day when I watching TRL I saw their new music vidoe ""Wake Me Up When September Ends"" I LOVE that song!!! Especially there's SEPTEMBER in the name of the song. I bought this album yesterday and it's grear!!! Just like my other CDs, like, taking back SUNDAY, early NOVEMBER, FALL out buy, THURSDAY etc,. etc., I LOVE this band!! Buy it TODAY!!!"
1,"Oh, sure.",I guess the music on this album (or any Green Day album...) would be just plain ok... were it not for a millions of 12-year-old poseurs that think they'll be SOOO punk if they listen to Green Day. -.-
1,What happened Green Day?,"I am so disappointed in this album, I borrowed it from a friend when it first came out and just couldn't believe what I was hearing. I won't even jump on it for being political, the music is just, bad, every song has an invisible meaning, on top of sounding like the entire album was written in 5 minutes. Now I love Green Day like they're my own children, but, I cannot endorse American Idiot. Surely they can do better."
1,Weel now,"You may have seen these sheets like these on cooking shows or at fancy stores under the Silpat name selling for huge sums of money and were discouraged. Well, let me end any confusion and tell you that these work the same way! They are like having permanent non-stick surfaces for baking, roasting, and even candy making. You may be a bit scared to put this plastic looking sheet into the oven at first, but don't worry, as your pie would be charred before it would ever melt.You may have been very frustrated by candy making in the past because the hot sugar would stick to anything that wasn't caked in non-stick spray. Fear no more, as this slippery wonder is a great working surface for kneading it while it's still hot or after it has cooled. If you want to keep it maleable for a longer period of time, set up a small heat lamp over the work surface."
4,At least they dont rest on there laurels,"One thing I can say about this album and this band is that they don't seem to be one to concoct a formulae and then crank it out over and over. Which is a shame as thats what a lot of people seem to want. I have always liked Green Day, it has been a while since I have bought an album of theirs but this one is pretty good. There are some really good songs, and some not so good songs but at least it is inetersting and never boring and repetitive. I felt it was worth while to listent to, listen to the samples and if you like the style buy it."
4,Nothing special,"Yeah, I know it's been out forever, but they don't send us everything. American Idiot is by far the greatest and most mature album that Green Day has ever produced. In the grand scheme of great rock albums, I found it to be nothing special."
1,Wake Me Up When The Fad Is Over,"Green Day is sooo kewl. Period. With such moving songs like Boulevard of Broken Records and the megarock of American Retard, I can see why they rule! They rock so hard I might need a Holiday!Forget it. Green Day sucks worse than Simple Plan and Good Charlotte's nursing baby. And that, my friends, is a whole lot of sucking."
3,"Missing Dookie, old punk-rock sound","This album has really desappointed me. I'm a real Green Day fan for over 10 years now, and as years go by, Green Day lose its intensity. Dookie was a pure work of art in the punk rock style, but now with this album, it seems that they are really depressed about our whole society... and I am too... but I'm listening music to escape reality and I want something that really hits and has some punch. If the whole album would sound like American Idiot, maybe it could be great, but most of the songs of this album are balads or really slow and sad songs... Green Day isn't that for me. If you love Dookie, Kerplunk and Insomniac as I do, save your money and go buy a ticket for their show where they really return to Green Day's best time. (Montreal - nov.4 - I'll be there!! =)"
1,This is music??,"Dear listeners,All though the majority of this country will contradict me,(believe it or not, I USED to be a greenday fanatic!) I think that this is almost as far from true music as possible.The musicality-- chords,overall sound is very sophomoric and rudimentry; in every song you can hear the SAME chord progression.The lyrics are about drugs and stupid things.Why don't you go listen to some Beatles, or Sigur Ros, or even classical, which, by the way, is TRUE music.I don't know why I'm making this argument; no one will listen. I hope someone out there will."
2,uhmmm ok album,"i have listen to this album about 12 times. i dont see what is so great about this album. its not one of the best albums i own i feel like i wasted money on this album, i hardly listen to it anymore. its not as good as everyone says it is."
1,green day punk i don't think so,hi im not really a 13 im 14 i just forgot my password and im here say to that green day is not a good band they suck they dont sound punk and i dont know why people like this band. If you want to listen to a band thats good and talks about poltics dont listen to this listen to system of a down or rage against the machine
1,Garbage,"Pure, unequivocal garbage. You want some punk? listen to the ramones or velvet underground. If you want mass-produced music for easily-entertained apes, then this is your buy! Its not the fact that this album is so popular that its garbage, because modest mouse got wrote a decent album recently that was moderately popular. The fact is that this band writes mediocre music, with no substance whatsoever. I've heard children's albums with more depth and heart than this. But i know that most people are stupid, and stupid people are into this kind of thing, so enjoy! :)"
2,Pretty awful on the ears.,"This is definitley Green Days worst album, they sound rather polished and maufactures on thi labum as well.Green Day started going down hill with Warning.This is'nt the Punk Rock sound of ""dookie"" or ""Insomniac""."
1,Somebody kill Billie Joe!,Just kill Billie Joe Armstrong and put an end to Green Day! The end of Green Day would be the best Christmas gift ever!
1,Awesome (crappy),"OMG this is da best album ever! It's soo heavy and brutal it makes metal bands seem girly. Green Day is far better than that Boysetsfire band that someone in one of my classes listens to. Green Day 4-eva!! Boysetsfire neva!(If you believed my sarcasm, then you must have an IQ lower than the number of tracks on this cd. Bathory's Sainthood by Boysetsfire is better than anything that Green Day has ever wrote. Boysetsfire rocks!)"
1,Suckes,"Green day along with all the other New rock bands suck. Listen to the true starters of real rock like Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Sabbath, Aerosmith, AcDc and the others...not this come on"
1,GREEN DAY SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!! This is a nightmare! heres the story on how I got this album. I asked my mate to copy me Ja Rule R.U.L.E, Beastie Boys To the 5 boroughs and Jay Z The black album (I like Hip Hop)and the next day he walked in and gave me Jay Z, The Beasties and THIS. I was like what is this? He said he misheard me so I thought may as well try it, I liked American Idiot. I got home, tried this last and by the end of the crappy song Holiday I was ejecting the CD out of my stereo and destroying this screaming f**k Green Day! I now spend 30 minutes a day destroying the disk. i've done all the following things to it which could help you!Stamped on it, Chucked it out my window, Used it as a frisbee for my dog, stick the disk to a wall and smash it with my soccer ball (I'm british and I call it football)and more. buy for torture.R.J from Britain"
1,The Politics of Boredom,"I have heard this album being compared to the Clash's ""London Calling"". Whoever would do such a thing should be spanked. I am so sick and bored of all mainstream music, mainstream tv, and just poeple in general. This album is the epitmy of many years of MTV trying to shove their ""punk"" bands down my throat. Enough is enough, ya' know? Too much of any thing is bad. It's time to get some talented musicians some face time. Maybe talent is a long gone fairy tale that will never happen again. Some people are content to think that this is alright, and that we should just accept it. Not me. Real punk was a result of people being bored with the music industry and trying to change it, but it obviously didn't work. It seems as if nothing can stop crappy poppy bands. And this band isn't helping anything."
1,another crappy pop band,"THANKS MTV Everytime I turn on the TV I see one of their stupid music videos or something else with them SELLOUTS. they are posers and people who listen to them are posers. Alot of the people who listen to these guys lisyen to other poser bands like the killers, simple plan, blink 182, etc.All of you are really punk rock listening to this crap arent you POSERS."
1,The American Idiot is you my friend,"Another bland, predictable ""effort"" by Green Day. How can any of you say ""American Idiot"" brings anything new to the table that this band hasn't been overdoing for the last 10 years. Honesty, their first record was pretty good, why now does American Idiot sell so many records. It shows no improvment or difference in style, and shows absolutely no originality or talent. Your all a bunch of idiots for buying American Idiot, but I guess thats the point."
1,Over rated pop fairies,"Can it get any worse then this?This band is awful, are they tryin to take out rageon this album?That stupid song American Idiot is polluting the airways everytime i turn the radio on.You have to be a 12 year old to like this but when i was 12 i was into slipknot and korn."
5,Punk rock? WHO CARES!!!!,"I'm getting so sick of people giving this album 1 or 2 stars just because they don't think that Green day is punk. I really don't care as long as their music is good which it is. Honestly review the CD not how punk Green Day is.Getting that out of the way, This cd is one of the best albums that i own! It has amazing guitar riffs and lyrics. Some good slow songs are ""give me novacaine"" ""Wake me up when September ends"" and ""We are the waiting"". My favorites are probably ""Holiday"" and ""Jesus of Suburbia"" GREAT GREAT GREAT album!! BUY IT even though its different from Dookie its still great."
4,"Great Tracks, Great CD...Great Band","After waiting four long years (and going through one ""new-wave"" side-project), I was pumped for new Green Day. Having been a fan since I was a wee youngen, I had high expectaions...and they were met with ""American Idiot."" The hard-edged political punk song is fantastic, and is the perfect way to kick off the revival of punk's three princes. The only reason I could not give the CD a full 5 stars is due to the fact that GD usually has 2 or 3 b-sides, but only one here. Still fantastic and a must buy."
3,GIVE IT A REST!,"Yes, we all love Green Day and their American Idiot stuff, but don't you think it's time to give it a rest now and give that spot on the radio station to a band that deserves it, instead of playing Boulevard of Broken Dreams AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN? I mean c'mon people. American Idiot 2004. It is now 2006. American Idiot has done it's job, and made us all warm and fuzzy inside for Green Day, but if I hear Boulevard of Broken Dreams again, I'm going to barf. It just goes to show you, it's not good when you overdo it. Even Green Day can get old. I know I'm not the only one out there that wants to hear something else on the radio."
5,It grew on me,"At first I hated this album, but I tried to like it, and slowly I began to like it. Its a pretty good punk album, it's not like that crappy Good Charolette and Simple Plan stuff....Oh yeah, and i'm a total punk rocker, i'm not on of those people who don't know what punk is calling this punk. I listen to alot of the old school stuff like The Circle Jerks, Dead Kennedys, Misfits, and I listen to newer stuff like Propagandhi, Leftover Crack, Rancid, and stuff like that."
2,Over-hyped,"O.K. maybe I'm being a little unfair but I'm just SICK of my 12 year old drawing heavy black around her eyes and I'm sick of seeing their faces everywhere I go. I hate ""American Idiot"" but I do like ""Wake Me Up When September Ends""."
5,"We are, we are, we are no longer waiting","I got this game when my school band went up to New York for St. Patricks day parade, and i'm so thankful i bought this album. I have bought Nimrod and Dookie on this website, and I love both of them, but this album surpasses them entirly. American Idiot is probably the best album i have ever bought, from the bush bashing American idiot to whatsehername. It is an impressive step from the band that sang about wearing ladies underwear and getting high. This is truely a great album. Every song is good. And there all fun to play guitar to."
2,An idiot to pay full price for this...,"I was really disappointed with this album. Sure, there are a couple of really good songs (i.e., the ones you've already heard on the radio) but the rest of the album was a bore. (Thank goodness I bought it used.) Yes, I get that this is a ""concept album"" but it didn't work for me. I don't think Green Day has the technical skill to try anything too ""artsy"". They should stick with what they do best: being a radio-friendly punk band.Not recommended."
4,A whole new Green Day!,"Leaving their goof ball punk days behind,American Idiot sheds new light on new light on Green Day that we have noty seen before.At the risk of abandening fans,Green Day new album has a totally different style shift from the latest album Warning.The base line is still very simple but produces and amazing rythim.Billy Joes vocals are amazing espeally on songs like Holiday or St. Jimmy.Green Day shift from punk to rock is simply there best decision in there lenthly carrer."
3,Meh.....,"ok, this albaum wasn't Green day's best. This was sad compared to the other work they have done. This album though will be loooked at by the posers as a cult icon. Screw that! I you want to hear good Green Day, check them out before they became sellouts. This album has about 6 good songs on it. take it from me, I'm a true fan, this doesn't come close to their old work. It'll make a fine additoin to your collection, but after a while you'll get bored of it, and it'll grow dust."
2,oh come on...,"seriously, this album is horrible. yeea, it was a good way to get on mtv and make millions of little teenagers buy their album. i'm sure more than half of the people who bought this can't even vote yet. it's not even the fact that its all political, its that they play all power chords.want to know the first thing i learned on my guitar? power chords! believe me, i can play these songs and i'm pretty horrible at guitar. get over the fact that they can play something political, so can any other band. go find some band that is doing it for the music and not the fame and money."
4,Their best album since Kerplunk,"I can't give this 5 stars cuz I reserve that only for absolute 100% masterpieces. This album, however, is growing on me big time. I didn't want to buy it but someone gave it to me so I listened, apprehensively. It just gets better and better every time I listen to it.Some old skool Green Day punk fans will say they sold out a long time ago. Green Day never claimed they were 'punk'. They just make music that originally appealed to punk fans, then all of a sudden they got famous and were labeled 'mainstream'. I'm not into punk or mainstream. If it sounds good, I'll take it.All these people who gave this album 1 star probably never really gave it a chance. Some albums take several listens before you can get an accurate opinion of it. Some albums sound awesome the first time but wear out fast, and sometimes it's the other way around.Or something..."
4,Punk rock opera,"This is what ""Tommy"" would have sounded like if it had been written and performed by The Ramones."
5,The Ricker presents.....,"Green Day have come back a lot more mature and interesting than i have ever seen them before. The band has really come full circle, this album seems more like Warning but pumped full of steriods. Warning was a highly political/social album that didn't get a lot of fanfare because it strayed too far away from the Green Day ""formula"" even Billie Joe said that Warning lacked some of the energy that they have had in previous efforts, this album does not lack an energy. This album comes back to green day of old for some instances but then takes off into different direction. There are some very touching songs that really show the maturing these guys have done. The lyrics are very well done and aside from a few songs like the title track, rock n' roll girlfriend, and St. Jimmy most of the songs change tempos and stay interesting. The best song is probably ""Holiday"" and ""Blvd. of broken dreams"". Just an amazing album by a band that can do no harm."
1,strickly for high school kids,"this is punk for kids who shop at The GAP. very ""lite"" if you want real punk find something else.these guys are the type of people who play at frat houses and read sports illustrated. strickly for the money punk. how dull and generic. if you buy this cd you are a high school football player who will attend somewhere dumb like ole miss or arizona state so you can get wasted and pick up chicks. how original!!!"
1,"Used to be good, now it's boring","Boring CD, lyics, etc... Greenday used to rock, now they pop. I LOVED Dookie. I don't have any respect for greenday now due to their lack of talent and WRETCHED political views. I think they are really going to be embarassed of this CD ten years from now. How disappointing."
2,Totally overrated,"This is overrated, but their are some good tracks here. they include:S.t Jimmy. Hmm, i geuss that's it.P.s: Green day are sellouts, and I have very little respect for them now. But their old music is worth listening to."
2,Not for me.,"I can admit, this is a pretty catchy song for what Green Day has been in the past. However, I the lyrics are kind of what turned me off. In a nutshell, all it talks about is disrespect to America and the shame of being an American. So, get the heck out of the country, for all I care."
1,i hate you people,"i hate u people who listen to green day. it sucks and they have absolutely no talent. they go from songs about farting to all of a sudden political. i hope they suffer in Hell for this album.you want good political music, get RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE!!! u stupid kids u."
1,This Band really could one of the worst ive ever heard,"first of all. i used to think greenday was awesome. until i relised they aren;t doing it for the music.they get payed millions of dollars to play instraments they arent even good at. the reason people like them is because they listen to classics with talent change a few chords and put lyrics saying they hate poser sell-outs and that the government is bad. then they get some famous butician to dress them up to make them look like a ""punk"". i personally put these dumasses under the line them up and shoot them category.the people actually saying this is good probably never even seen a real punk preformance before. and are even worse then greenday itself."
1,Another sellout.,"Another sellout album for the pile....................1. Green Day ""American idiot"" (2004)2. U2 ""How to dismantle an tomic Bomb"" (2004)3. Stereophonics ""Sex Violence Language other?"" (2005)4. Foo Fighters ""In your honour"" (2005)5. Nine Inch Nails ""With Teeth"" (2005)6. Audioslave ""Out of exile"" (2005)7. Velvet Revolver ""Contraband"" (2004)8. Garbage ""Bleed Like Me"" (2005)9. Tool ""Lateralus"" (2001)10. Stone Temple Pilots ""Sheerang Laa Dee Daa"" (2001)11. Bush ""Goldenstate"" (2001)12. Weezer ""Green Album"" (2001)13. Metallica ""St Anger"" (2003)14. Live ""Birds of Prey"" (2003).......and those are just the good bands!!"
1,Another Good Band Bites the Liberal Dust,"Well, there goes Green Day. There is ONE good song on this CD, and it's Boulevard of Broken Dreams. The rest of the CD? Not even commenting. It's driven by a hatred of conservative values as well as a hatred of our great President, George W. Bush. This ends up being the cd, as well as Green Day's undoing. Yes, I've heard this whole CD, and it's horrible. Will I buy it? No. I'll just download Boulevard of Broken Dreams, thank you very much."
1,okay,"You GreenDay fans should look at Larry Young and Albert Alyer!! There amazing. But hey it's not likely(1 out of a million)that your going to look at those guys. So this is a okay cd. I'm not a punk fan. My best friend is and he played it for me. The hole thing. I'm not a Rap,Pop,rock,etc.fan. If I told you what I really like you would laugh."
5,There is something wrong with you if you don't like this....,"You cannot call call them posers and then call yourself a punk. It's just.... UNTHINKABLE.Punk bands: GREEN DAY, NOFX, MISFITS, RAMONES, SEX PISTOLS, ANTI FLAG, BLACK FLAGPOOPY BANDS: DAVID CROWDER, SIMPLE PLAN, FALL OUT BOY, HAWTHORNE HIEGHTSA BAND THAT IS KINDA POSER BUT OK TO LISTEN TO BECAUSE THEY ARE THE MOST CREATIVE BAND I KNOW: PANIC! AT THE DISCO(they DON'T act punk, so they're ok)"
3,Okay..,"I'll admit, their songs are pretty good, but, really, do they have to cuss? And Jesus of Suburbia is soooooooo long, I almost died. Personally, I like their earlier stuff."
5,Kicks Bush right in the ass!!!,"Man this CD is so amazing.Songs 1-7 are simply awesome.8.She's a Rebel (6/10) Nothing special here.9.Extraordinary Girl (7/10) I like the melody, but i usually skip this song.10.Letterbomb (10/10) My favorite on the entire CD. This song is fast with amazing lyrics, man i just love it.11.Wake Me Up When September Ends (5/10) Nah, don't like this one. Waaay too slow and not catchy.12.Homecoming (6/10) This is another 9 minute song. I think one part of it is good but the rest - crap.13.Whatsername (8/10) Slow at first, but gets really good at the very end.BONUS TRACK: Favorite Son (9/10) I like this song. Very fast and well.... typical Green Day.Overall this CD is a must have to any Green Day fan or Punk-rock fan. Its kind of hard to get into it the very first time, but giving it more than one try won't disappoint."
5,Green Day's Best Album in YEARS,"I loved Green Day when I first heard them in a confused adolesence frame of mind. Since then everything i've heard by them has been less than mediocre. Not Blink 182 bad, but not Dead Kennedy's good. Don't get me wrong, this is NOT a punk album by any means, but one of the best straight ahead rock records released this year. I wanted to hate the album when i heard about it, then we played it at work, and i was converted. The new album is an astounding piece of sonic art that all should purchase, no matter what your preference is, you will love this album."
5,IF YOU DONT BUY OR LIKE THIS CD YOU ARE INMUMAN,"Green Day does it again!!! So what if I was only three when Dookie came out- I own all of their records, and American Idiot certainly wasn't a disappointment!!!! Even if you aren't a diehard fan like me, it has REALLY good songs on it that even my friend(who only listens to the Beatles) loves! This is definately on my top ten list, and i recommend it to EVERYONE!!!GREEN DAY ROX!!!!"
5,these guys rock,these cd is the best cd out there beside encore by eminem.I am not even a big puck rock fan but i love these cd
3,pretty good,"I'm 12 and in jr high school. I'm not one of those poser guys who don't know anything about punk rock. I wanted to get this because I love green day and their style. However, this is not greendayish enough for a green day album. whatever happened to those philosophical witty lyrics, annoying sounding vocals, and catchy distortion?"
1,Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha....,"Since when Greed day start making songs that have season or month? Wake Me Up When SEPTEMBER Ends??? That is real funny when I saw it on TV, I can't believe it! Green day become an EMO band!! Just like FALL out boys, early NOVEMBER, taking back SUNDAY, etc,.etc.,A good emo band shouldn't name their album American Idiot, it's not emo and it's idiot."
5,Must Listen To This In It's Entirety,"First off, this is easily Green Day's finest CD. It is their ""rock-opera"" and in listening to it, this can be heard. The CD tells the story of a disillusioned youth who grows up alienated and confused; all of which is caused by the world around him.If you listen to it in isolation, you can almost envision scenes between each song that would lead into the next song. Though I hate musicals, if this were one, I'd see it.All of the songs are incredible and flow into one another very well. Even the title track is important to the story. Just imagine it as the opening scene of the story that is ""American Idiot"".Note: This album is not entirely about Bush and the government. Much of it talks about how society creates it's own problems and fails to take responsibility for the effects of those problems."
5,Great!!!!,"Ok, this cd may not be really punk, but who cares??? I DON`T CARE!All of it songs are great, and that is not all...they tell a story! an ""American Idiot"" story!Listen to it, you will understand... and you won't regret!"

1,I hope THIS greenday isn't here too stay,"I havent been a major fan of greenday, but i can remember singing along to the minority video in 3rd grade. Hell i even remember seeing longview on tv, and i think their older pre 2004 stuff isnt that bad. Unfortunately, this album gets repetetive and annoying. Maybe it is the radio overplaying it, but sorry, all you 13 year old teeneebopping girls who think otherwise, the songs arent that great. I always switch off my radio when they come on, i find them seriously iritating. Whenver i hear an old greenday song, i leave it on. This album proves a step down into the mainstreem MTV teenebopping pop world for greeenday, and i hope maybe someday they're return to their roots.Avoid.2/10."
2,Utter rubbish.,"I am a 13-year old junior high student.I try to listen to ""good"" music,like Radiohead, Joy Division, Smashing Pumpkins,Cocteau Twins, Wilco, etc.Everybody at school listens to this album.Over and over and over. It's so dumb. Every little snotty kid asks for this for Christmas. And it's possibly the lamest album I've ever heard. So many cliches...so much fluffy pop...This is PUNK? This is anything but punk. Is it ""punk"" to be MTV darlings, making cliche-filled video after another? Is it ""punk"" to lodge 2 songs on the radio to be played 6 times a day? Listen to classic punk from the 70's (e.g., the Ramones, The Clash, X-Ray Spex). It's so much more passionate than this hunk of crap.Green Day has totally sold out. DO NOT buy this album.There are so many albums out there with meaning, with a message...RevolverOK ComputerKid AYankee Hotel FoxtrotCloserVitalogySiamese DreamMellon Collie & The Infinite Sadnesspeace"
2,*yawn*,"I own this album, have listened through it completely several times, and honestly, I can't see what the big deal is. Green Day was a decent band that lived out its heyday during the early 90's punk revival. Now they are trying to repackage their tired 3 chord tricks in the form of a ""concept album,"" with drawn out epic versions of basic Green Day pop diddies, and a few 'sensetive' tracks to grab the attention of the easily swayed MTV crowd. It's decent for what it is, but I certainly don't think it deserves the ridiculous amount of attention its been getting. Try listening to a real concept album, like Yes' ""Close to the Edge,"" or Pink Floyd's ""Animals,"" and then listen to ""American Idiot"" and decide for yourself whether Green Day is really as 'ingenius' as they've been made out to be."
1,Oh god....,"ANOTHER pop band with 12 year old girl fans that will listen to anything they see on MTV. They were decent when they made Dookie way back when, but god, they've just joined the rest in the pathetic MTV line of bands that you'll never see again in 10 years.METAL UP YOUR ASS."
3,old is better,"Only good songs. Bvbd, holiday, whatsername. thats it. buy nimrod or dookie. download the other songs. good thing sombody burnt it for me. greenday went downhill when they started getting political."
4,I was skeptical,"A friend of mine bought this early the day it came out and called me raving about it that night. I was skeptical at first, having heard the single before and not really being happy with it. I went out and bought it and listened to it all the way through.This is really a well done album and shows the band's maturity. The music builds off all of their earlier stuff but is different in its own way. It might become my favorite green day album to date, my favorite song was holiday and my least favorite was american idiot."
2,To Radio Friendly for me,Dookie was great.This is just basicly every track but 3 trying to get on the radio .While all the pop punk fans want to feel part of somethign and say wow they are really doign something no one has ever done wow.But the fact is that Punk Rock has been about qestion issues since the begging and now 30 years later green day gets the memo and it's like wow Green Day really pushed issues . News Flash nothing is life changing about this album.
1,"this crap sucks, pop sucks, poser rock sucks, green day sucks",green day was never good...they sucked donkey nutsthey posersthere mainstreemmainstreem sucksdont waste ur moneyif youve alrdy wasted 13.99 on this trash i feel bad for youheres what you should be listening toAnything by these artistLed zeppelinRamonesClashSex pistolesiggy popqueenvan halenaerosmiththe doorsguns n rosesvelvet revolverninect ectDONT BUY THIS I REPEAT IT SUCKS!
1,Pop - Punk Invasion,"Hmm what can i say?. except i am sick of hearing appraise for bands such as green day and good charlotte and simple plan. and also i am SICK of there fan base of little 13 year old teenyboppers who think that what they are listening to is in a ""nutshell"" punk rock. ok elements of punk rock are definatly in green day. i can ashamedly say that i (was) a fan of nimrod and the bands older material...simply because of its catchyness and how they played with the times. but i would never have considered them a ""punk"" band. what disgusts me about green day fans is they (mostly) wouldnt have a clue who great artists such as the DK's are or maybe (shock horror) even the sex pistols. what i am trying to say is that green day are a simple commercially acceptable ""pop-punk"" band, and should not be categorised into a punk genre"
1,aMeRicaN RetArd,"This album makes me ashamed that the the word ""american"" is being exploited by crap bands such as green gay. come on idiot and stop using auto tune, that is if your a real ""punk guy"". Green Gay has been scamming people with their shallow and universally interpreted lyrics for quite some time and it would'nt suprise if this sick cycle continued as long as people were ""american idiot"" enough to buy this crap fest of power chord garbage which is over produced, in tune(what???? punk is not sposed to be in tune ie. Naseua). So in other words I'd rather listen to a continuous loop of ""cocaine blues"" by the man in black than this ego manical garbage cuz atleast the cash man didn't have auto tune!!!"
1,Green Gay?,"I was a fan of Green Day but only for the album dookie..sadly with this album came out I no longer liked anything my green day.Seeing 9 year olds with their American Idiot shirts running around made me want to puke.When the video American idiot came out,I wasn't that eager to hear it(since i was only a fan of dookie) and after hearing it, I instantlly knew that people who had never heard of green day in their lifes would instantlly eat this up.Billie and his band had sold out.(I knew someday it would happen).This cd is supposed to be *punk* but its nothing close.They came out with a lame pop punk cd that had sell out written all over it.But of course selling out maybe the best for them since they got more fans of this than they ever had in the past years.I'm 14 but I seem to now that this is onw lame cdgreen day 1 star for getting as many fans as you did.I applaud you,you sellouts"
1,Green Day have sold out.,"This album is just not comparable or anywhere near as real sounding or as ""good"" with their proper albums which are ""Dookie"" ""Insomniac"" and ""Nimrod"" Nimrod including that bearable but also dreadful song ""Good Riddance"".""Warning"" was a bit......a bit to soft and poppy and now this ""American Idiot"" an album that proudly displays itself as being an example that rock n roll can be dangerous.Which about as true and effective as trying to drown yourself in a bath tubb of marshmellows.The music sounds fake, the video clips are stupid and annoying, the lyrics are garbage and their image is nice and tidy......this is not Green Day this is a poppy punk band who look like they are in it for the money and not the music."
1,PLEASE! MAKE ... THEM ... STOP!!!!,"Who ever said these guys are punk or this album then they should really do a head check. This is so mainstream its not even funny. Funnier is how these guys managed to sell themselves out and even being nominated. 'Boulevard of Broken Dreams', who said this is the best song of 2004? If you did this is prolly the only record you bought thro out the year and the only tracked you played. Have em check what punk music is, go do your research and see if you can come with something else up.Wanna hear something more pathetic? Im gonna go see them live since my 14 year old cousin needs somebody to go with her. Hope somebody else volunteers. Damn!!!"
2,overplayed,"most of the songs on this album are way overplayed. infact, if you walk up to any poser with a green day shirt on and ask them to name 3 songs that are not on the american idiot album, they will not know there is other green day cd's. what happened to the good days of greenday? i remember nimrod and dookie (my personal favorite green day cd's). such songs as Welcome to paradise, Baskit case, and good ridence(time of your life) are 5 times better than the entire american idiot cd combined. if you actually listen to the lyrics from american idiot, every song has the same lyrics. in conclusion, green day is going down the drain with this cd. if you want real punk rock, try other bands before american idiot like bad religion, social distortion, the offspring, rage agenst the machine, or blink-182. or if your into classic rock try guns 'n roses, acdc, red hot chilli peppers, or the ramones."
3,Eh.....,"The album is alright, nothing special.Bille Joe Armstong is another in a long line of celebrity blowhards trying to tell us Republicans are evil, the President is out to kill everyone who disagrees with him, the south is full of stupid people, religious people are morons, and that war is always wrong.The funny thing about ""Holiday"" is that while it is supposed to be a protest of the Iraq war, I could easily turn half of the lyrics in the song to show removing Saddam was a wise idea. If President Bush was the slightest bit like Adolf Hittler, Bille Joe Armstong would be in a dark and quiet prison cell for 23 hours a day.In the end, the true American Idiot is Bille Joe Armstong himself."
1,ONE OF THE MOST OVER RATED ALBUMS,GREEN DAY ARE REALLY BAD.I DESPISE THIS POP PUNK BAND.THEY MAKE AWFUL BANAL MUSIC AND ARE ONLY MEANT FOR ADOLESCENTS AND TEENAGERS.ANYONE RATING THIS AWFUL ALBUM FIVE STARS IS WORTH A PITY.STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS AND THEIR WARNING ALBUMS.THEY ONLY MADE ONE LISTENABLE ALBUM IN DOOKIE.GET THAT.
2,use your own mind,"Well, it appears that this three-chord wonder group has put out yet another unnecessary album. This time, they've done well for themselves to capitalize on the anti-bush, pro-liberal sentiment, pumped into the minds of their fans via the pitifully liberal music video corporation. They've chosen to make anti-pop music that is anything but anti-pop. Here is another example of a dwindling pop band hanging on for that last cash-in. People, true punk rock is long gone. Neither Green Day, nor their fans have anything to whine about these days. It's just a shame."
1,Over-hyped comercial crap,"This album blatently uses its Bush-bashing to cash in. Their so called political statement is nothing more than cleverly devised (but heavy handedly carried out) marketing ploy, to cater to teen angst. Who ever said Greenday are the saviours of rock 'n' roll deserves to be shot!! Save your self a lot of pain and avoid this album (and Greenday in general) at all costs."
1,Ultimate trash,Green Day are amongst the worst bands along with Foreigner.Billie Joe Armstrong is amongst the worst singers and this music is only meant for BABIES.The music is plain bad and sucks.AVOID THIS LOUSY BAND.GREEN DAY SUCK!GREEN DAY SUCK!GREEN DAY SUCK!GREEN SUCK!GREEN DAY SUCK!GREEN DAY SUCK!GREEN DAY SUCK!GREEN DAY SUCK!GREEN DAY SUCK!GREEN DAY SUCK!GREEN DAY SUCK.AVOID ALL ALBUMS FROM GREEN DAY.Get BACK IN BLACK from AC/DC instead.
2,...,"""Bvl. of Broken Dreams"" is a great song with a horrible title. I really think that's it for this CD though. It's not so much as it's bad as it's just... boring.This band reminds me a lot of JD Salinger and his books other than Catcher In The Rye (in regards to Green Day's Dookie.) I don't really think I have to explain myself there."
3,"Good sound, good lyrics...but classic sellout syndrome.","Dont get me wrong, Green day has been one of my favorites since Dookie in 94, however, like many self proclaimed punk rock bands they have fallen to the status of sellouts. You may ask yourself why the views and look of the band have taken a sudden drastic change in views: The make up, the patronization of 'American idiots' are all tending to the needs of the next generation teenagers who are so suddenly intrigued by politics because of the upcoming presidential race and the war in Iraq, and the new look of the ""punk rebel""...as seen on AFI and several other bands. Im not saying this isnt a good album, it is, but dont judge green day on this if its your first time."
1,Worst band out thier.,"Greenday is so awful my word their music is just unlistinable. People say their sellouts i dont because they were never big enouf to be a sellout. Their music really sucks its kinda like if the backstreet boys got bored being a boy band and decided to take a stab at rock. Their lyrics just thrash the government thats not original bands were doing that since the 60's come on try something new my gosh. Even if you do like this band you wouldn't require this cd since their horrible music is ethier always on mtv are as i call ""queer tv""."
1,I'm not sure if they're american but idiot is right!!!,"I'm going to be straight up honest with ya'll. American Idiot was the worse crap I've ever heard. They're like Ozzy Osbourne or the KISS group. A bunch of gothic losers who can't sing at all.Why would they call themselves American Idiot? is that funny? What's the deal with these white males who dress gothic? Good Charlotte is wack! Helena is wack! and other female names with gothic virgins group.""Green Day"" was so bad. They are pathetic goths who need to get a life!!!!!"
1,Review of American Idiot,"Any one who has heard true punk rock knows that Green Day definitiely doesn't fall under that category. They are a watered down, commercialized imitation. Their lyrics are little more than socio-political cliches and their guitarwork is simplistic at best. Their songs all blend together after awhile, with no distinguishing attributes in any of them. Billie Joe Armstrong's grating vocals are as irritating as the lyrics. Tracks like ""Dearly Beloved"" sound more like pop than rock and in ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"" Armstrong whines and tries but fails to be profound. Furthermore, their whole attempt at a ""concept album"" is merely a self-absorbed conceit on the part of these inept wannabe rockers and lacks any real creativity."
3,It was okay,I liked a couple of songs on here but after listening all the way through I kinda regret buying it now. But I still love the band.
4,One of Green Day's Best,"American Idioit is the newest cd from mega group Green Day. This Cd is fantastic. The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 is because ""Boulivard of Broken Dreams"" other than that this cd is great."
5,Excellent,This albumn had all of the sounds of the old Green Day that everyone loves with new controversal lyrics. This albumn rocks!
5,one of my favorites of all times,"This Green Day CD will definitely be one of my favorites of all times. I love the tunes and the variety of instruments played. This is a CD that you will over and over and over again and never get sick of. You find new things about the songs each and every time, that you'll never get bored."
5,Love the songs,My friend has this CD and I plan on getting it someday she got me into GreenDay becuase I never really liked them but I liked the song Wake Me Up When September Ends. Then I listened to her cd and I was like wow... So I have to get!
4,Great Album,"I'm not a big Green Day fan, but I really like this album. The songs on American Idiot are in-your-face rock. The top songs on this album (IMO) are American Idiot, Boulevard of Broken Dreams and Give Me Novacaine."
5,American Idiot,"There are two types of folks that are leaving reviews for this album. Those that get it, and those that don't. The title says it all. Brilliant."
5,not a kid just to lazy to look up my password,"This album has had so much negative criticism that it doesnt deserve. People have dismissed it without even giving it a chance just becuase its more ""mainstream"" or that the music wasn't enough like dookie or other early green day. You want things like dookie, go listen to dookie. Getting to the point, the music on this album is good.Not only is it good, its great. The Long story songs Jesus of Suburbia and homecoming are exelent. Wake youll find yourself humming wake me up when september ends and whatsername. Youll be awed by the whole album. This is a definete must own for any fan of rock."
5,Good Job Green Day!,"I've been listening to green day since dookie and like another of your reviewers I agree it is not as ""punkish"" as some of there other works,but I must say I think this is one of the best so far.Like a fine wine green day is getting better all the time. If you like green day at all you should definitely add this one to your collection."
5,american idiot by green day,this is an awaesome cd! i listen to it often and its in my favorites in my itunes playlists. its great for someone who likes punk rock and good music to work to. recommend it to anyone who likes rock or alternative
3,WHAT HAPPENED?,"OKAY!! hold it.. what happened to Green Day? What happened to long view, She, When I come around, hitchin a ride kinda thing!!!... now Green day is EMO... with the black eyeliner and all. What is with bands today? the used, My chemical romance... And there so called emo ways? This album is alright.. but definatley not the Green Day we know and love. I personally think Green Day should just stop. God knows I love them.... they are punk gods... but i think their time came..along time ago..and they had it... I really don't know what else to say... Cheers"
4,Growing Up Fast,"It is clear that the Who, Beatles, Hendrix, Stones, Kinks, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd are classic greats of modern music. As for Green Day, whether they know it or not, much of what they do, has been done. In this case, they do it quite well. Hey, ""The Kids Are Alright"", and they are growing up. Enough said. It is nice that we have this free forum to voice our praise, or criticism of products, such as music CD's. Unfortunately, it is open to the immature individuals, such as ""MTV Supporter"" to voice completely useless and crass opinions. It would be safe to say that MTV does not share these ridiculous opinions, and that this individual could not honestly have checked the ""I am over the age of 13"" box !!!!!"
3,gets old fast,Some of the stuff is good but after a while it gets really annoying. My bro bought the cd and its driving me crazy! Like I said before some of it is good but its really something you listen to a couple times before its old. Its even worse though because they wouldnt quit playing everything on the cd on the radio.
1,y do people like this so much?????????,american idiot is the most annoying song i have ever heard. people should stop buying pop rock. dont waste ur money buying whats popular now because in 5 years this cd will most likely be collecting dust under ur bed or in ur closet. if u want to listen to real rock then pick up some rollong stones or ac/dc. stay away from this stuff its ruining rock.
3,"Catchy, but no talent","Ok Ill give it to these guys, they make some pretty catchy tunes like Boulevard and Time of your Life. But lets face it...Their music can be played by any musician and when I say ANY musician I mean it. I started teaching my little brother guitar three months ago and he can already play every Greenday song the way it was originally written. Come on guys, catchy but not talented. If you think otherwise you know nothing about music."
2,"Different message, same boring delivery","Green day fall flat on their faces with American Idiot and prove that they're nothing more than a one trick pony (Dookie). Billy Joe trying to deliver anti-imperialist songs is like Adam Sandler doing Shakespeare. Green day fans will have nothing to complain about but for non-fans, don't beleive the hype."
2,TO THE PERSON BELOW WHO SAID GREEN DAY IS BETTER THAN PEARL JAM,"I'm just a reviewer that might buy this album and came looking for other reviews. To the person who said Green Day is a much better band than Pearl Jam, what are you smoking? Id rather be trapped on a desert island with Pearl Jams greatest hits album alone than every Green Day album and Green Days greatest hits album combined, at least Pearl Jam act their age"
1,what happened?,"uh, yeah this album kinda sucks. big time. Green Day think they're doing something so huge by writing this ""rock opera"". but what they don't realize is that nothing they do can top Dookie. They are oblivious to this obvious fact, so decide to start wearing studs and eyeliner to appeal to the youth of today. very sad, I must say. But the main point is, the songs on this album are pretty dern terrible. Green Day have failed, as we all knew they would eventually. If you want a good rock opera check out the Who's ""Tommy"". Throw American Idiot away and purchase Dookie, or even that new Gwen Stefani cd, even that blows American Idiot away."
1,Overrated,"This album has way too much hype, it really isn't that good. I bought this album based upon all the great reviews I have been hearing; even though I couldn't stand to listen to any of the singles that were being over played on the radio. This has to be one of the most overrated pieces of garbage I have ever heard. It lacks everything that Dookie ever was, and from beginning to end is nothing but another bad pop album. I don't know what everyone is talking about I guess."
2,A huge dissapointment - honestly.,"Billi Joe Armstrong said that this album is the best ""PUNK ROCK""album in 10 years. Well just because Green Day is considered a punk rock band, does'nt mean this album sounds like it.The real Green Day sound came from the albums ""Warning"" ""Dookie"" and their most in your face powerful punch - ""insomniac"" (I think Nimrod was'nt that good) but this is just mainstream junk.The band sound so polished and fake on this record and very mainstream, which is not what Green Day should be.Green Day have hit an all time low with this, and while mainstream audiences will all love it.People who like real sounding music and a real band will see through it, and they have.They are being supported on tour by ""Simple Plan"" for goodness sake!!!"
3,great cd going pop,yes thats right green day pop punk its good just not great there not like they were
3,Don't Wake Up Green Day When September Ends.,"I'll admit, I bought this cd, listened it, like it. But they get too much respect, this ablum isn't good, but it's not bad. I just OK. Nothing Special here. I don't know what everyone is hyped about, there's nothing uniqe about this album ""Wake Me Up When September Ends"" use to be a good song, but it's been on the radio so many times it's lost all meaning. Actually all the singles they've released from this album are way over played!!!! It's not cool, Everytime you turn on the radio ""Holiday"" is on. Green Day's older songs are better. American Idiot is played out. If you haven't heard this album yet don't worry, you're not missing anything.I give Green Day's American Idiot Album 3 whatevers out of 5."
1,This sucks,"First off this is not punk, this is pop with instruments. I am 14 and everybody in my school has this d*mm cd and I can't stand it. Green Day Have never been good. I bought a copy of Dookie last year and ended up giving it to GoodWill. All this is is overplayed garbage with a political statement that there shoving down our throats If i want to hear politics I'll turn on CSPAN not put in a record. If you want punk try The Clash, Ramones, Sex Pistols, Velvet Underground, or anything else. But please dont buy this album and let them make another one."
1,Pathetic.,"You'd have to be an American Idiot to even purchase this album. Of course, since most of those who purchase this album are a bunch of little Middle-Schoolers, you already know that."
1,AWFUL.,"DO NOT BUY THIS CD.As much as anyone says to, do not.Ask any pre-AI fan. They will tell you.This is complete crap and it is the worst Green Day cd yet.So DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM.It is rotting, gathering dust in my room as I type this.Check out their older stuff, cause it is NOT like this useless piece of crap.Thank you < 3"
1,How is this dangerous Billie Joe?,"Wow, what a pile of crap, and worst of all, people are praising it - and its not just an opinion either.Theres a difference between music thats ""real"" and music thats thrown on a plastic disc to make money and keep the record companied happy - and that is not music at all.Listen to Green Days earliear album, Insomniac, thats as dangerous as they ever got, and I guess you could call it dangerous, but more angry and with nasty lyrics and hard, edgy outragously loud guitar playing.You call this dangerous, well it certainly looks thats way, since its an album popular amoung small children to older people.What do I call it ""##$#%% Rubbish!"""
1,Worst album.......EVER!,"If you listen to Green Day, you are a trendy loser who only likes the music that is ""hot"". This is just bad music all around. QUIT CALLING GREEN DAY PUNK! They are far from punk! They suck! Punk rock isn't about whining about rejection or winning grammies! Green Day SOLD OUT! For all the kids who like Green Day, they don't care about you! They don't care about any of their fans! THEY CARE ABOUT YOUR MONEY! Listen to some real music!"
3,I like Greenday but...,"I didn't really like this album. ""Holiday"" and ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"" got so much radio play, it was just damn annoying. ""American Idiot"" was pretty good, I thought. But now I think they've released ""Jesus of Suburbia"" which I think is a mistake. Isn't that song like 9 minutes long? ""Wake me up when september ends"" wasn't all that bad. And my favourites off the whole album were Give Me Novacaine, and St. Jimmy.The rest of the songs I found weren't that great. And those really long songs (Jesus of Suburbia, Homecoming,) I find to be VERY long and boring.If you like Greenday, I recommend their album ""International Super Hits."" This has all...or at least most of their singles..before this album."
3,"Pop Punk ""Rebellion""","If you want to hear rebelliion there are groups doing something a lot more interesting than pop punk anthems. You also have groups like Skinny Puppy with their Greater Wrong of the Right album. Something completely different and pretty darn original if you ask me. American Idiot is basically doing the same thing most Green Day albums do with no real evolution in their sound. Therefore, all you're left with is an album that's getting successful based more on a rebellious attitude toward the administration without much in the way of taking music in new directions. Yeah, there are some ok pop songs on here but I'd rather hear a message as well as something that hasn't been done before."
3,Cheez balls and 7 -up...,"Back in the early 90's, these guys made a huge impact on the face of modern music. They revolutionized ""punk"" and really were one of the main bands to make ""punk"" cool and mainstream. I think they get lumped into the pop punk crowd unfairly. They've always done their thing, and they sure know how to make money. The thing about this album that disturbs me is the fact that they really do get political now and not only is that just trendy, but it's really in bad taste. I have to say, based on that fact, these guys really did finally sell out. Get some old school punk instead, like Black Flag. Or some new stuff like Tiger Army or Rancid. It seems more real to me."
1,A polished blend of bland,"I love how many levels of stupidity are at play on this dummy projectile. It's bad enough that this uninspired, self-congratulatory cacaphony is closing in on 15 million units sold worldwide and has fooled scores of itchy, calloused critics into dishing out kneejerk-positive responses -- but on this crock opera, these sots rail against the very things they represent as a band in this marketplace: corporate scum, imitation, ennui. And excuse me ... the ""media"" Armstrong blasts on the title cut includes his watered-down trash of a concept album. The lyrics are bland; the whole thing has the stink of bandwagonry. They came across as lazy, ivy league dropouts on ""Dookie,"" and now they're grown-up ""American Idiots."" Congratulations, boys."
1,DRM cd,"I wish there was a note on the product detail section that this cd was a Digital Restricted Media. I wouldn't have bought it if I had known. I bought this cd because I thought songs sounded interesting. Then I found out I can't listen to it on my laptop, I can't listen to it in the car, I can't convert the music to mp3 to listen to it on my IPod while I workout. Basically, it's an useless $13 item to me.It's going to be the last cd I'm buying from Green Day or Warner Music."
1,Overplayed,"THis band is over i think i have heard enough green day to last for enernity. i hear them on every radio station in the world i think i even heard them on a country station. they are taking aover the world we should all run from the ""G"" section in the store and go to the ""J"" section and find a real band like jimmy eat world or something. Like i said before this band sucks and is overplayed throughout the continent..."
1,MINDLESS GARBAGE!,"POSSIBLY THE MOST OVER-RATED BAND OF ALL TIME. THIS IS PURE BUBBLE GUM POP FOR THE AMERICAN IDIOTS WHO JUST EAT UP WHATEVER IS FORCED DOWN THEIR THROATS BY MTV, CLEAR CHANNEL AND BIG MONEY-MAKERS IN ARMANI SUITS. PLEASE PEOPLE, WAKE UP AND START THINKIN FOR YOURSELF. THERE IS A LOT OF GREAT MUSIC OUT THERE. IF YOU LIKE PUNK, TRY: BAD BRAINS, CRO-MAGS, MINOR THREAT, BLACK FLAG, AGNOSTIC FRONT, SUICIDAL TENDENCIES, BIG BOYS, DEAD BOYS OR SOME NEWER BANDS LIKE PROJECT 86, NO INNOCENT VICTIM, DODGIN BULLETS, STAVESACRE, ANYTHING BUT THIS! THESE IDIOTS ARE NO MORE PUNK THAN (...)!"
2,Meh,"I just want to say that holiday IS the passenger by iggy pop. And that Jesus of surburbia or one of those songs IS summer of 69. And the lyrics are lame. By the way, if your one of those jackasses who thinks this album is better than Tommy, die."
2,Are there any real Green Day fan's here?,"I doubt it. If you want a good Green Day album pick up Dookie, please. I almost want to cry when I hear ""Wake Me Up When September Ends"", it just is terrible compared to old Green Day. Please, pick up Dookie, you will be pleased."
4,As a Gift,"I purchased this cd as a gift for my boyfriend, and then I ""bought"" myself a copy. All the songs on this cd kick ass. My favorite would be ""Are we the waiting"" Very powerful music and lyrics. I would reccommend this cd for everyone. Probably the best cd since ""Dookie"""
1,Garbage,"Green Day has made pretty bad music since the beginning, and now they're trying to hock their ignorant political views."
1,bLAH,"This album is blah. They are posers trying to be Avril Lavigne, but they have failed because Avril has been around longer than them and is much better~ They also try to be JoJo, but JoJo has been around longer...and has more talent....so why is Green Day trying to copy people?! Posers! They have to use technology to enhance their voice! I agree!Don't buy this CD, unless you like wannabes.I Recommend:The Cheetah GirlsJo JoAvril LavigneJustin TimberlakeHilary DuffLindsay LohanJohn TravoltaFrank SinatraThe Little Mermaid SoundtrackThe Lion King Soundtrack 2"
1,"more like ""Californian Idiots""","I've already heard the song ""Amercian Idiot"" before this album was released. I used to like Green Day at one point, but now they're nothing but arogant ""hippies"". In other words, I'm sick and tired of these bands preaching their political speeches in their concerts (this includes Incubus, Dave Matthews, Eddie Vedder, and those I forgot, you know who you are). After all, don't we go to concerts to hear their music?!? Save your political speeches for conventions. I am boycotting this band and others that I've mentioned. Put a lid on it. GOD BLESS AMERICA AND GOD BLESS OUR TROOPS!!!"
2,Becoming Britney Spears?,"Take a listen to American Idiot...though it is a good song....it sounds like Britney Spears' voice being enhanced with technology. How sad for a bunch of California rockers.The ultimate song is ""Wake Me Up When September Ends""...but doesn't compare to Warning's ""Good Riddance"". Want a good album? Buy Good Charlotte or Hilary Duff!"
3,Pretty Good not Great,Green day is nothing more than a boyband with guitars. Although I like this cd it's not worthy of 5 stars. I actually like Dookie better.
2,I don't get it.,"I don't get the ""Punk"" music that came out way, way after the punk revolution was over. What do these guys have to rebel against? I don't know.That aside, I also don't really care for Greenday's very formulaic structure to songwriting. It all sounds the same to me. Maybe I'm a stickler, but whatever. I see no difference between this and the stuff they put out in the 90's that I didn't love either.Don't bash me for my opinion, and I won't bash you for yours."
2,"Get ""The Wall""","If I have to hear one more song from this album I'm going to lose my mind. Armstrong woke up one day and thought he was Roger Waters. Unfortunately, he doesn't have the writing ability or the talent. Oddly enough I love Green Day (usually), but a Rock Opera? C'mon! Peter Townshend is crying somewhere. Oh well.Oh, by the way. When your one of the biggest bands in America, and you blatantly steal riffs and beats from other bands, you should probably credit them.P.S. Man these guys have lost their credibility. Next time you release an album and claim it has nothing to do with politics, please don't come back a year later and claim it has a strong political message. Wake Me Up is and was never about 9/11 so why is it all of a sudden about just that? How much more money/respect/acknowledgment do you need?"
5,Just a quick thing...,"Um, to the soldier who wrote the review,... Green Day music doesnt criticize what you do... theyre point is that the US government isnt run in the greatest way.They are pointing out that war is a terrible thing that we should be more aware of. I think you should give Green Day another chance by listening to some of their older songs like When I Come Around . I can see your point of view, but Green Day is just awesome...."
5,One of my new favorites,I'm not a big fan of the music of today but my sons turned me onto this album. It's now one of my favorites !
5,I voted for Bush and I still love this disc!!,"Who would have thought that the best disc of this decade so far would belong to Green Day? Yes, I said decade. I am just a luke warm fan of the band (I think I have an old cassette of Dookie collecting dust somewhere) but this CD stands out in a world of MP3 players and Ipods. This disc demands to be listened to from beginning to the end. Like many of the theme records of the 1970's this rock opera is outstanding. It echoes of the Who's Tommy, but it is distinctly Green Day. The band has kept the punk edge while bringing the music to a new level. The rhytham changes and the moods of each song are so well thought out that one can not help being sucked into the world of American Idiot. Those those few that are crying about Green Day selling out, maybe its just that many now know what a just a few knew before, this is a great band."
2,This band's over....................,"I used to really like American Idiot, but now it's over. Boulevard of broken dreams needs to be over right now...so as the rest. Green Day are so overrated...Punk is overrated, go get Foreigner insted.""For you, Waiting For A Girl Like You, have a nice day, you may not like this but that's ok."""
5,"Awsome Album, Best of the year.-Mel","This album is great.It's different from all the stuff that out today.Green Day have become one of the bands you can never forget.They are a band that can create a nine minute song like Jesus of Suburbia and have the song make you want to keep listening.If you like any of the Green Day Albums, you will love this.If you didn't, give this cd a try.They aren't the same Green Day they used to be.You can't not like this cd.It's impossible.Even my parents like it, and they hate the type of music I listen to.So please, give this cd a try.You never know, you might like it."
4,Give it a chance,"I loved Dookie back in the day, but haven't bought a Green Day CD since..until now. I was hesitant to buy this one, but after a coworker recommended it and really enjoying their 3 singles off of the CD, I gave it a chance when I saw it on sale. Suffice it to say, I was anything but disappointed.American Idiot is much more than the singles on the CD. Moreover, it's much more than the politically charged title song. It is, pure and simple, an archetypal collaboration that will surprise you with its unrivaled originality and passion. On every song, Billy Joe, Mike, and Tre bring it. Wake Me Up When September Ends is my favorite track and was an unexpected surprise on the CD.Tracks #2 and 12, Jesus of Suburbia and Homecoming, respectively, treat the listener to 4 unique, yet unmistakably intertwined songs which are seamlessly meshed within each track. Holiday and Give Me Novacaine are also standout tracks that truly resonate and vibe really well."
4,not your ordinary day,"While many people have criticized me for thinking American Idiot is Green Day's best album, I will continue to listen to it anyway because the vocal melodies are extremely catchy, and even though the sound of the album overall is very commercialized, that doesn't interfere with my enjoyment at all. The songwriting really feels like it's better than ever before. ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"" is probably the best song."
2,Not so great.,"I have to say that this is a weak cd. The riffs (If you could call em that)are junk and half the songs are filler. there are a few good songs like Holliday thats why I cant give it 1 star. But, all I am saying is this cd is no breakthrough. Billie Joe can not play guitar, and if you think he's good I can tell you know nothing about Guitar."
5,A great album,"I don't really consider myself a diehard Green Day fan. This is the only cd I own by them and I normally would have passed this one by but I since it has received such praise and since most places have it on sale I figured I would give it a shot. I can't tell you if Green Day sold out or not but what I can say is that this cd really wowed me. Now, I was already a bit sick of the radio hits before I bought the cd since they are played so frequently anyway but its the songs on here that haven't received radio time that make this album so great. Jesus of Suburbia is definitely my favorite and the rest are also quite good. If you like any of the singles that have already been played to death, be sure to give this album a try, its the other songs on here that will have you hooked."
5,Absolutely loved this album!!,"Wow! This was the best album i have ever listened to. In fact, its pretty much the only album im listening to at this point. I play it over and over 24 hours a day. With so many different kinds of music and types of songs, it would probably suite the wants of many different types on music lovers. There are upbeat, song like St. Jimmy (awesome rocker song!!) and letterbomb (awesome lyrics!!) and slower songs like Wake me up When September Ends (great song, one of the best on the album) and Are we the Waiting (GREAT CONCERT SONG, I would know becuase i went to a concert and it was one of the greatest concert of all times) Even though these songs were amazing,I think the best part of this album were the 9 minute long roch-operas. Jesus of Suburbia is my absolute favorite and is absulutely amazing and Homecoming is right behind it. Overall, i LOVED this album and would recommend it to anyone."
5,The best album of their career!,I was not a big fan of Green Day when they first came out. I was biased because I like classic punk like The Clash and others. After hearing this album several times I realized that this is a real classic album.I also have been converted as a Green day fanatic.All the songs are strong and relevant. All the bands that copied them are now dust after the release of this classic in the making best album of the year.
3,"Nice, but that's it...","Greenday's ""American Idiot"" is a very nice album, ""Boulevard of broking dreams"" is a real hit, so is ""wake me up when september ends"", and I'm afraid that's it. Surely there are more nice songs in here, but to tell you the truth, I really expected for more.Don't take it the wrong way, if you'll get this one, I'm sure you will enjoy it, but I had my hopes for something greater, but That shouldn't suggest it's not a good album."
5,Listen to it more than once,"Ok some of you so called Green Day fans are saying that this album isnt a work of art, but you are very much mistaken. Sure, its not Dookie, but nothing will ever beat that. The first time I listened to the cd, I WAS dissapointed, but then as I listen to the cd again and read the lyrics I realized that this IS a materpiece, Blvd of Broken Dreams and Holiday have EXCELLENT lyrics are and excellent songs. If you have listened to this CD just once listen to it again and give it another shot."
5,Wowza best album EVER,"Some people who like Green Day would be like ""How good can this be"" especially after Their album Dookie. But it's so much better. By far American Idiot is the best album with the best songs green day has ever made. I would suggest this album for any punk rock fan. Go Green Day!!!!!"
5,One of the best albums i've ever heard. ever.,"Firstly, i consider myself a fan of most genres of music, so this is not a biased review. I own or have heard many of what are generally considered the best albums ever made, however after hearing ""American Idiot"" i feel this should be included on these lists in the future. This album is without a doubt one of the finest ever to be released in recent years. The level of songwriting and performance are truely stand out among a sea of mediocre music that we've been subjected to recently. This cd requires you to listen to it straight through so you can appriciate the story the album tells. however, in case you're interested, i feel the best songs (although they're all good) would be jesus of suburbia and Boulevard of Broken Dreams. Congrats Green Day, on making one of the finest albums ever released."
5,Green Day redefines the sound of punk,This CD is very much deserving of the praise it has received. Excellent from start to finish.
5,Hate Bush? If You Do Buy This!,"American Idiot is an awsome album. It shows Green Day's maturity as a band. It has a very clear message- Bush Sucks. This album has very good songs like Jesus Of Suburbia and Wake Me Up When September Ends. Another good one is Boulevard Of Broken Dreams. If you want a good cd to listen to you should buy this cd. Some people say that Green Day's older stuff was better, but don't listen. If you like the older stuff then listen to that but if you want something new buy American Idiot. Because in my opinion ALL their stuff is good. I have been listening to Green Day since the beginning and this album shows how far that they have come as a band. And the best part is that they are standing up for their beliefs and speaking thier minds about the tyrrant in office. This cd is well worth the money!"
2,Totally not Green Day...Old School fans know that!,"The only song on this cd that sounds like traditional GOOD Green Day is American Idiot...a good song with awesome lyrics that reflect what anyone could see is going wrong with America through the media....but the rest of the album is ballads!!! Green Day are a punk rock band, descendants of the Ramones...so why do they have to make a concept album? Rock N Roll isnt brain surgery and if they had stuck to their working formula this album would be absolutely kick-ass just like every other album from them. I'm not saying that I want the same album over and over again...Green Day doesnt do that. I mean Warning had slow mellow songs but it worked and it was quirky(like Misery). I love that album. But for the first time since the beginning I am disappointed. Hopefully next time they will make another Punk Rock record minus the piano and ballad sound. Stick to the good stuff, dont buy this one this time around."
2,Ok...,"I'm sorry but Green Day is so overrated; easily the most overrated band of the decade. The music isn't even interesting or thoughtful. The songs are so repetitive, basic, and full of hooks: perfect cocktail for the mainstream audience to gobble up. And dont get me wrong mainstream isn't always a bad thing. Green Day just shoulda sticked to their roots."
1,UK Fools,"What a crock of **** this is , its meaningless wailing of the sort you guys seem to lap up at present. As a lover of GOOD ROCK MUSIC from the land that invented it. I can honestly say any one from the UK buying this is a fool. Come on, whats your problem ??sort it out . There are enough of you over there in the US to stop this crap turning up over here. Stick a few more volts through IGGY THE GOD , and maybe we can get another true good rock music album. Train your youth NOW to learn MUSIC before you start producing WILL YOUNGS all over the place .You must revolt, as this is revolting dire rubbish. I have harder rock in my toothpaste!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!UK TED."
1,Green Day,"Hey teenagers...Pssst, get this...(whispers) music is deadShhhhhh don't tell anyone i told you - you need to keep wasting your money on it to keep these (and other) talentless reprobates employed."
1,Boring.,"What the heak happened to Green Day, ""Nimrod"" and ""Warning"" were dissapointing compared to their albums ""Dookie"" and ""Insomniac"", but this is just utter trite, and totally lacking of any inspiration or let alone - music."
1,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING,"I thought green day was going to be back on track with this album but ..... i was sooooo wrong!!!American idiot sounds sooooo similarrrr with all their other records, and they even start making realllly terrible and generic songs like boulevard of broken dreams and that song When Sept Ends is way too cheesy for me. Sept ends Sounds more like a cheesy bon jovi song to me and thats really bad a for a so called ""punk band"". The only song I enjoy is holiday which i thought was decent at best.Conclusion: I am over with green day and they'll probably have a new fan base of 13-15 year olds.. There r so many better new bands out there today. I suggest u spend your money on other new albums by new bands like arcade fire, franz ferdinand, bloc party, interpol, kaiser chiefs,razorlight, or even u2 who I believe r still king eventhough they made that cheesy ipod commercial!"
2,they were once...alright.,"2 1/2 ,I saw Greenday Play many years ago ( 1991) they openedfor some local bands I was into and at the timeI thought they were pretty good. I saw them againthe next year ( they headlined) and thought they were better,but they really neverimpressed enough to follow their career. here weare almost 15 years later and greenday is still playing(although FAR more popular. that first time i saw themthere was maybe 50 people there) yet their music hasn'treally progressed much ( are they lazy? maybe high, hence the name.) there were alot of bands in the early ninties that played this exact style of pop/punk I just think this band decided to stick it out a little longer than the others,which obviously paid off. but as far as this group and album, up for as much ass kissing praise that it has received with such a worn out,overblown,down-troddin' genre of music just proves that it must have been a really slow year in the music buisness/grammys."
2,most effort but not as good as DOOKIE,"they put a lot of effort into this. the whole f***ing CD they're talking about some retard named jimmy. who cares if he died??? this was very annoying. another thing i hated was that only the first 6 songs were really good then the rest sucked. you don't need this one, save ur money.2 best songs: american idiot & holiday2 worst songs: wake me up when september ends & st. jimmy"
1,Amazingly Bad,"Terrible album by one of the worst bands of all time. When Spetember Ends is terrible and has one of the worst drum beats known to man. They're way overrated. Primus should take their place because thats also three people but they're actually TALENTED. Yes, good ol' Les, Ler, and Herb. SOOOO much better than these losers. These guys have no talent. Songs are made up of, what, three guitar chords??? And no solos????? I've written better, not even kidding. Drum lines are bad. Bass=bad. Well, I've wasted my time writing about a terrible album with nothing good to show on it. Go with classic rock."
1,uh......this sucks!,"This album just sucks. It's soft and it's well stupid. U thiught this would be a loud band but its not. if u like soft ot reguar rock, this is for you, it u want something loud, look at Mudvane."
2,It's still Green Day,"Unless you really liked the Green Day sound when they first hit the charts, you won't find any significant stretch here. There is no comparison of this album to the classic ones done by Pink Floyd, The Who, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. Time will show that.Green Day needs to drop the punk persona and really start exploring. There is talent in Green Day but they are trapped in the sophmoric, punk sound which has been limiting them. If they want to be timeless/classic artists, they need to obtain a broader appeal."
1,MOST OVERRATED BAND IN HISTORY,I DETEST GREEN DAY WHO ARE AS BAD AS FOREIGNER AND NIRVANA.AMERICAN IDIOT IS ONE OF THE MOST MORONIC ALBUMS OF RECENT TIMES.EACH AND EVERY SONG IS AWFUL.FOR A GREAT RECENT ALBUM GET LIVING WITH WAR FROM NIEL YOUNG INSTEAD.ZERO STARS.
3,Eh...its just not that good.,"everyone who sees this album as such a great break through for this band, does not listen to enough music. if this is the gab that will bridge your musical tastes, then thats a good thing, but thats all this album can be. its just not that great, the lyrics are pretty good, but its also just Green Day. they are the reason i play music. the first song i learned was Good Riddance. ive listened to so much music since then, that they are only just a platform for memories for me. they are still catchy as hell though. if you're a long time fan and have a lot of respect for this band, get the album, but dont expect a masterpeice. its not the best music ever written, but for Green Day, its pretty damn good, its just not the sound they're best at. i am going to listen to this more and maybe my opinion will change, but ive liked every other green day record from the first or second listen. this just isnt cutting it so far."
2,they should have retired after Dookie,"They're trying so hard to be musically mature and it's so stupid because they're just so not. Oh wow a tribal drumming intro to a sub-par pop-rock song, that will make it good. Oh and how about a 9 minute sub-par pop-rock song, just drag out those simple mediocre limp energyless riffs that aren't even catchy for 9 minutes and... and... and... I don't even know what they wanted to achieve with that. This album is just stooooooooopid."
1,GREEN DAY! NO THANKS!,"GREEN DAY PROVES ONCE AND AGAIN THEY SHOULDN'T EVEN HAVE A RECORDCONTRACT.AMERICAN IDIOT IS ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO RECREATE A PASTWHERE MUSIC OPERA'S WERE THE ""IN-THING"",REMEMBER TOMMY? HOWEVERTHIS CD IS NOT EVEN CLOSE.IT IS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.GREENDAY IS ALL ABOUT THE MONEY THESE DAYS ANYWAY,THEY ARE TRYING TOBE THE CLASH, HOWEVER THE CLASH DID THIS MUSIC 25 YEARS AGO ANDDID IT BETTER!"
1,Why?,"Man, these guys are really messed up! They have some great rhythms and then they have to mess them up with the stupid lyrics, I mean when will the IDIOCY on their part end? Can't they at least leave the ""F"" word out of their songs!?"
1,i wish this band would break up already,"what is music coming to, this stuff is horrible, when i heard itthe 1st time i was ready to run into oncoming traffic green dayis just 3 guys who sold out and have no idea what music is aboutif you buy this cd you will regret it"
1,trash,Wow what do you know another mediocore realese from another mediocore band we get these songs this year and will get the same songs next year just more and more boring overdone bubble gum pop songs if you own one greenday record there is no need to buy this one or any other one becuase if you have heard one you have heard everything this band has to offer this band has been giong for along time but still fails to record anything somewhat original or thought provoking whatsoever anyone who takes political insight from billy joe is a tool
1,American Idiots,Why don't you get bombed you stupid anarchist punks. These types of morons want to mess with the country and if they got the country they would not do s**T. Why don't you grow up you stupid punks. The only good song is Bolevard of Broken Dreams.
1,Americans ARE idiots...,I hate americans. Thanks Green Day for naming this album AMERICAN INDIOT to show that you american droks admit it.
2,Didn't care for this garbage.,GREEN DAY SUCKS!!!!!!!Please choose wisely when you choose helpful or not because it took me 6 hours to come up with this review.
1,Not the best,"Green Day I will admit was good in the 90s. Dookie was the best album they had but I never did find myself liking this one. MTV always play it and it sounds like poltics I hate poltics. But before you think I judge bands think again cause I dont judge them before I know who they are. I listen to the music then I can decide if I like them. For example the other newer punk bands I listened to them before I judged them. Many people are trying to be these bands now, which is kinda ""poser"". The word poser is overrated I know but dressing up as someone or something your not is not who to be. Why cant people just be theirselfs, and like the bands not look up to them and wish you were them. Green Day has a talented vocalist Bille but I dont really find myself into Green Day anymore."
5,Great Album!!!,This one of the best albums I have ever listed to ever. Every song is great in its own way. The only song i really didnt like was Extrodinary Girl it got a little to poppy for me.My personal favorite was Jesus of Surburbia. If u havent already bought then wtf are you waiting for go and get it.
2,Enjoyable At Best,"I don't know why everyone is saying this album is such a fantastic leap forward. Besides two abnormally long (for punk) songs and the floating string section at the beginning of ""Extraordinary Girl,"" this album is somewhere between rock-radio cliches (sample lyric: ""Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me/Till then I walk alone"") and the four power-chords riff that Green Day has recycled oh so many times before. Billie Joe, I want my $14 back!"
3,Green Days Comback,"This was a good album. Not great. Ive noticed that alot of people have been giving this album some poor reviews when it became an MTV hit. Mtv might have gotten some songs stale, but still this is a fantastic album. Too compare these with other ( Including Good Charlotte and Simple Plan) is kind of retarded. Sure Green Days chord structure may be simple, but their lyrics are quite good.Also how can they be an emo band if they dont even write emotional lyrics, they write POLITICAL ones."
3,Green Day have lost their touch,"I have been a Green Day fan since the Dookie days.I grew up listening to Billie Joe, Mike Dirnt and Tre Cool and I used to think Green Day was the greatest band in the world...but not anymore.I cant believe these guys have changed so much over the years.I guess the punk rock gods have mellowed (which has made them terribly boring!).American Idiot is a disappointing album and is way too overrated.If you are hoping to find the agressive,cheeky songs which were characteristic of Green Day(pre Warning days) in this album,you're mistaken.Billie Joe's attempt to re-create the American Idiot version(Wake Me Up When September Ends)of Nimrod's Good Riddance is a disaster.But American Idiot is not that bad, I mean there are some tracks like Jesus of Suburbia,Holiday,Whatsername,Give Me Novacaine which kick a**,but I still prefer listening to my old Nimrod cd anyday."
5,The Best Record of 2004.,"This is indeed the best record of the year. If you don't have it already, do yourself a favor and go get it. In fact, get two. These boys probably already have enough money, but that's not the point. I would venture to say that this album is almost as important to rock and roll as Nirvana's 1991 masterpiece Nevermind. Don't wait! Go now..."
2,WTF,Wow these guys used to be so good. They ae the biggest sellouts i have ever see. If you think this is punk rock wow. They have 1 punk song on here called St. jimmy you have probablly heard all the rest on the album which is why you should not buy this. Let me tell you that Jesus of suburbia is a great song but that cannot change this poppy emo cd. what happened to Dookie age.
4,"If you are looking for the best that Green Day has to offer, this isn't it.","If you look at the title expecting Green Day bashing, you are sadly mistaken. American Idiot is an spanking good album. However, when considering this is supposed to be the ""big comeback"" it's somewhat lacking. The whole Bush bashing thing has made Green Day stray from the things that got them famous in the first place. That said, ""Holiday"", ""Jesus of Surbia"", ""Give me Novacaine"", and St. Jimmy are still pretty good songs."
5,Away and back again.,"I could go on a rant on how alot of the bad reviews are just that bad amungst themselves. But nah I was 13 and heard dookie and just back tracked from there and after dookie they did things that were diff etc. But I have to say this is closer back to the sound I like than ""time of your life"" it just did nothing for me that simple.So I never considers these guys punk(except if I were to choose a PUNKISH sounding band this would be them...and besides you posers thinking its the way you sound,dress etc. are idiots, that only counts in MUSIC catergorization and segregation. As long as there is something to hate there will always be punks. Its that simple.The album greens my day = teh wr0kz0rEAT IT"
4,Green Day - A Teens perspective,Wow! I have been listning to green day for a long time and I must say it is the best. In referance to some other reveiws I think that the lyrics while being slightly related to world topics are alright. Name one band that hasn't done a song or said somthing about the world or politics. And Two I am not stoned who ever posted that reveiw. I would highly recomend this album.
5,your attention please,"I already did a review on this album(see:a new great part of rock history.my review's way down there though...),but i just wanted to make another point that someone already really did.everyone who gave this album a bad review doesn't talk about the cd but how retarded everyone is who likes this...how dare you!!!!!!!!you're the retards here!look,don't listen to those people,this album's kick a(I never told you what I do for a living)ss.I'm deeply insulted!an i'm sure everyone else who likes this is to.sorry for having interests in things!but don't try telling us we're heroin addicts for enjoying this masterpiece,now for the album,it's great,instead of explaining what each song means again(just look at my other review),i'll tell you my favorites,Jesus of Suburbia,Holiday,Wake me up when september ends,letterbomb,an homecoming.thats just in my opinion.if ya like this album,check out their other grammy winning album dookiethank you"
3,Not Bad But Not Great,When I picked up this book I was under the impression that it was a comedy. But as I read the book and it came tougher there was no side splitting funny parts. Aside from the point it was a good book and kept me reading but a little misleading in the title.
1,not the best book,"This book disappointed me a lot. I thought it would be a lot funnier since part of the title is ""A comedy in three parts."" Plus the main characters pull the worst pranks. In addition to that one character in the book wants to go to Montana for no good reason and the ending is horrible.I would highly suggest that you not pick this book."
5,"As Always, Top Rating For Top Author","I ordered this one back in July, and have been on the edge of my library seat wating for it! Well worth it, too--once again, Richard Peck delivers the type of story we have come to expect, and to appreciate, from him: human, real, funny, wry, and honest. My only complaint: Not enough! Seriously, for the age group he was targeting, the length is just right--but for middle-aged librarians... well, as usual, I put down anything ""Peckish"" with a sigh of bliss for the tale, and regret for its end. Please, more, and soon!"
4,The Teachers Death...mwahahahah,"I read this novel for a book report. I definetly enjoyed this book! It is filled with humor to keep you laughing thoughout this book. I think that many kids can relate to this book, wherein they do not want to start school again, and don't intencionally want there teacher to become sick, but every kid has dreams. There is a twist...with one of the main characters! I think that this should be a book that you read in your literature circles."
4,If someone 10-15yrs old confronts death give this book.,"Please if you are a funeral professional and have a young person at home purchase this book. If someone has to go to a funeral and is young this book will help.Please do not blindly give this book away or force it on others. Young Folks can have a hard time processing a funeral and a death. This should not be put into schools for reading by all. It is an effective book for the appropiate moment: a funeral or a death. The book is quite humorous but few young folks appreciate the humor or the time frame of the book: the early 1900's. If you are a funeral professional the book can help your young ones accept what you do and the changes you help others with. All this said the book brings forth much laughter,the poem on page 43 is a real yuk."
1,BLEH!,"I had to read this for my elementary newspaper and I thought it was horrible! It said it's supposed to be a comedy, but I found nothing funny!"
2,Comedy? Don't Make Me Laugh!,"I had to read this for an assignment at school. My group didn't laugh at all, but then when we had to make recomendations to tell others to read the book. That HAD to have been one of the hardest things in my life. Though it was well written, I'll give Richard points for that, but still, even though this book is meant for kids 11-15 it most probably will not interest the kid at all..."
3,Not as good,"This book was okay, but not as good as the author's book, ""A Year Down Yonder"", which was hilarious."
4,Excellent Album,"I bought this album this past tuesday when it came out after calling several stores to see if anyone had it (not many did), but it was well worth the effort. In my mind this is the best solo album by any of the members of Phish. There is a lot of great pedal steel playing on this album and some great bass playing, as would be expected. My favorite tracks are Outside Out, Soul Food Man, The Teacher, and The Lesson. The lesson features some great drumming by phish's own Jon Fishman. If you are a fan of the songs Mike Gordon wrote with phish or of the album he made with Leo Kottke I would highly reccomend Inside In. Also, if you're a fan of Mr gordon's writing style check out his book of short stories, Mikes Corner."
2,Two stars because is NOT what is advertised,"The Mozart Concerto on this disc put out by the shameless pirates at ""Iron Needle"" is the THIRD Concerto, not the FIFTH as described. I am sure I had mentioned that on an Amazon review before, but it vanished..."
2,This movie is by far the worst but...,If you like nude guys wrestling each other for 1 whole hour then this is your movie there is no after scene like in a hot steamy shower. Just nude guys wrestling I thought it was boring.
1,Don't like being ripped-off? Read my review,This disc is nothing more than junk in surround sound. That is the reason you see NO SAMPLES here. That is the the reason that all of the reviews here are FAKE- designed to convince you that this is a good product. This is a GUERILLA MARKETING tactic. You can see that for yourself simply by clicking on the reviewer's names and looking at their other reviews. They are mainly ALL for this series with a few for others BUT those are cross-linked back to these!So what is on these discs? Basicly nothing more than MIDI sounding versions of classical music. There is absolutely nothing artful here at all. I would not take any of this series if they were handed out for free. This is a scam plain and simple.
1,Very Disappointing,I disregarded some review warnings but discovered the hard way that they were right on the money. This recording seems like shabby synthesized reproductions of Bach music that does the great composer a big disservice. Uncommon in deed - uncommonly poor!
1,UNCOMMON BACH,"This DVD-Audio disc is supposed to be recorded as DTS 96/24. Neither my OPPO DVD-Audio player nor my Denon DVD player can find any DTS encoded track on this disc.Otherwise to review this disc on its merits, to me it sounds like it was mastered or composed using ""garage band"" on an Apple Mac and then converted to lossy MP3. It's awful.Giving it 1-star is an over-rating, if zero was an option then that is what it would get. My copy of this disc is being returned."
4,Weight limit,The box does not have a weight limit marked on it.I weigh 170 pounds and this solid insert is not firm or tough enough.It nearly was not wide enough for my 1.95 size tire.I would recomend it for up to 1.90 or 1.85 size tire.It is for children not adults.
3,MAKE SURE YOU PLAY THE CD ALONG WITH THIS DVD!,"OTHERWISE, YOU'LL BE HEARING THE STATIC-Y BASS THAT SOUNDS TERRIBLE!GOOD POINTS OF THIS DVD, WAS THAT THIS WAS NAILBOMBS FIRST AND ONLY APPEARANCE WITH SPECIAL GUESTS HERE AND THERE...GOOD LIVE DVD, BUT MAKE SURE YOU CAN PLAY YOUR COPY OF THE LIVE CD ALONG WITH THE DVD, TO ENSURE A GOOD SOUND!!"
2,"I want to watch it again and again, but I just can't.","'Bridal Fever' offers a very good story. All actors do a fine job. What I cannot tolerate is the 'Jake' character, who is an absolute bore, immature, irresponsible, yet 'Gwen' falls for him completely. The viewer is not given one reason to like him, nor to understand the 'Gwen's attraction to him. Why was this character written so shallowly? We're given depth with 'Dahlia' - and a very fine performance by Delta Burke, I must say.Eh. I just can't watch the movie again, I mean, it has a bookstore, publishing, the foils of celebrity, and the cinematography is great, costumes, lighting, art direction - but so wish I could get past the 'Jake' 'Gwen' relationship - although you cannot call it that at all -- and it's irksome to have an entire movie destroyed by such a throw-in/throw-away character. Phooey! You have to wonder how a bunch of people working on a film could not have corrected such a major character problem."
4,Pleasantly Surprised!,"The 1MM Italian Diamond Cut Sterling necklace surpassed my expectations. The lobster claw clasp is sturdy and the necklace itslef is spectacular. Very shiny, fluid and overall very appealing. I had recently bought another sterling silver necklace at Macy's for twice the price which I wasn't as happy with. I will look to order more items from Gem Avenue in the future. Thank you!"
4,"Sparkling Diamond Cut Sterlingt Silver 30"" snake chain","The chain is shiny and beautiful and the clasp is very good. Great purchase. I had been looking for something like it in the stores and couldn't find anything that even comes close. I received the chain within a week or less...forget now but, it was very fast. I'd buy from Gem Avenue again. Thank you"
2,Sturdy should not be in the title of this item,"I bought this chain for a pendant I made for my girlfriend. The clasp came apart from the jump ring the first night. Also, her hair keeps getting stuck in the links. This is a snake chain which should be very tightly linked. Altogether I found this to be pretty and shiny, but rather thin and flimsy, and the clasp is so tiny that it is hard for anyone to use unless they have very nimble fingers. I went to a local department store and purchased another one that was higher quality for the same price as this one. I will use this at another time after fixing it, because I don't want to pay return shipping."
5,Elegant,"Ordering jewelry online is always challenging as sometimes what you see is not always what you get. however here I am pleasantly surprised. The chain is just great, elegant and pleasing to the eye."
2,Nice looking but,"I like the look of this chain but had to return, it was yanking my hair out in chunks within 15 minutes of putting it on. Would never buy again."
1,sterling silver chain,I purchased the sterling silver 1mm chain 18 inches. I thought that since it was stated that it was sterling silver it was a good piece of jewelry. I recieved the chain and wore it for about 4 hours and it changed colors. This chain shines and sparkles but it is not worth nothing. I advise anyone not to invest in this product.
1,I hate it!,"After a week of wear this chain turned, tried to clean it with a jewelry cloth, no luck. If I can kept the reciept would be returning this!"
2,I want to like this,"This chain is beautiful and fit my pendant that I received for my anniversary but this chain grabs my hair. I can't feel any rough areas on it but it will grab and wind pieces of my hair around itself, maybe mine is defective? even though I don't see anything. I ended up using a different chain because I couldn't stand having my hair pulled all the time. My hair seems to wrap around near the clasp. This is OK for an occasional wear but I find it unacceptable for daily wear."
3,silver chain,"This was a good value for the money, but it was a lot thinner than I expected it to be from looking at the pictures online."
1,"SN030DC-18 Nickel Free Italian .925 Sterling Silver 1 MM Sturdy Snake 18"" Chain Necklace",i bought three types of thisand all came in RUSTi wonder what kind of silver was usedi am a faithful customer on amazon and i wonder why i should be treated like thisi know i can return these but i ordered for an occasion made so much noise and now see what i have
4,chain for a locket for a 13 yr old girl for her birthday. it is just perfect and I like the low price.,"I bought a beautiful locket for my 13 yr old granddaughter without a chain. The chain I bought from Amazon is the perfect length, and looks like it was made for the locket. very satisfied."
5,linda k,I just love Amazon. I have made many purchases and was totally satisfied with all of them.My latest purchased was just as I expected. Price was good as was the quality.
5,Beautiful chain,"Purchased this chain to replace chain on a pendant that was too short. After receiving chain, found that it did not fit the pendant I wanted to use it with (my fault). However, I like this chain so well that I used it with another pendant that I had. It is beautiful and well made. A real bargain!"
5,Great buy,"I love the way this chain falls on the neck, beautiful fluid movement. Just the length I was looking for."
2,sterling silver snake necklace,The length of the necklace is perfect. The clasp is fine. My objection is that it looks a lot more sturdy in the photo than it actually is. Very fine and wimpy looking chain. Will notn order from here again.
2,Arrived tarnished,The chain would have been nice but it arrived tarnished. Haven't decided if I will try to clean it or send it back
2,sterling silver chain,I thought I ordered a longer chain and it's too short so I can't use it. I'm not sure how to return it.
1,bad quality,"this chain it's too bad, the material it`s not good, is black in some places, very upset with this product. not recommend"
5,Like liquid silver!,"I bought one of these for my wife and one for my daughter to go with some very special pendants so of course I wanted the quality to be perfect. The low price made me wonder but the reviews convinced me to give it a try (and I was prepared to send them back had that move been a mistake.)I was not disappointed and neither were they; in fact, we were delighted. The picture cannot do the necklace justice. The shine is like liquid silver and the feel is very fluid. I have seen much more expensive necklaces that were not nearly as impressive."
5,A truly sparkling snake chain with an unbelievable price!,"Because of their fantastic prices compared to the competitors, I gave Gem Avenue a try and bought six chains to go with gift pendants. I was not disappointed! This chain had great sparkle and draped fluidly as a snake chain should. The clasp was strong (italian-type), and the chain held the pendant securely. So pretty! The chain, at such a great price, even came in a small gift box that could be wrapped and well-presented. Very good customer service, good delivery time. I'm happy!"
5,Perfect Chain,I have been looking for a nice lightweight chain of good quality and length. This one was perfect. Also they are very quick with delivery. I will shop with them again and again.
4,Pretty and sturdy,I had to replace a broken necklace and this was almost the same as the original one I had. The necklace is sturdy . The clasp is a smaller than I would have liked but it works.
3,A little thin,"When I bought the chain, i expected it to be a little thicker & longer but that is my fault. The chain did break at the female clasp end but the vendor quickly replaced with another one."
1,Whoops!,"This is a follow up to the very positive review I gave this necklace about 1 1/2 weeks ago. Well, this morning after a very easy turn of the chain to move the clasp to the back of my neck, the chain just snapped apart, not at the clasp but just in the middle of the chain, like someone had just cut it with scissors. It is a shame because it looks really nice but now I am out the money and no chain. Very disappointed. Had not had it even 2 weeks."
1,Chains arrived very tarnished,"I purchased two chains for my 2 granddaughters. I was very disappointed with the chains when they arrived. They were very tarnished, and I had to polish them before they were useable. I was also disappointed because the texture of the chains was quite rough. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
5,Sparkly and pretty,"I ordered one for myself and one for my mother-in-law, and we were both very happy. The diamond cut makes it very sparkly and pretty. And it seems to be a nice-quality chain."
4,Need dainty fingers,"I love this chain. It's very pretty and looks expensive. I bought two different lengths and am glad I did. My only problem is that I struggle with the dainty fastening hardware. I was bringing the necklace to work and asking for help putting it on until I added a short extender with a larger clasp and now I'm happy. If you have a hubby or child who can help, then it would be a 5-star product! Gem Avenue, the vendor, is great...."
5,Like starlight,"To hold this chain in your hand is like holding shining starlight. It's a tough chain, despite its delicate appearance, and this is the second one I've purchased. I will without doubt be buying another!"
5,This chain is beautiful,I love the diamond cut. It makes the chain look very expensive. It looks great with or without a pendant.
1,It turns!!!,"I bought this chain to go with a locket for my mother for Christmas. It was very pretty when it arrived, after a month she had to stop wearing becaue the color started to turn on her neck. ITS JUNK!!!!"
3,Great looking chain,The clasp has too small an opening on an otherwise great looking chain that really sparkles. I will be a great gift.
5,Beautiful,"I love this chain. Very sparkly and smooth. I purchased one a few months ago, and came back for another as a gift."
1,Kept Thinking it Would Get Better,"Disorganized. Not well written. Lots of unimportant detail. Then a lot more unimportant detail. Two of the cold cases are never solved -- which is reality, but not worth reading about. I was really disappointed."
4,fun,The game is fun.I would recommend it for anyone who likes a good action game with a few puzzles tossed in.
4,Dont buy the new one.,"This game sticks to the storyline its fun to play with some quirks here and there. I would write a full review, but if you want to finish off a storyline this one is the way to go. If you like the first and the second you cant go wrong."
3,Repetitive and tedious,"I agree with other reviewers that the graphics and vocals are good, but I find the gameplay itself less than stellar. For starters, I've always been irritated with games that don't let you save your status whenever you want. Sometimes I just want to get in a quick dose of gameplay, but that's not possible with these games that require you to play through an entire section before being allowed to save. That contributes to the repetitive, tedious nature of some sections. If you get stuck getting through a certain bit of the game, you're doomed to replay much of what led up to it over and over again.I realize that tricky camera angles are some of the challenges that are supposed to exist in this game. More than in the earlier versions, however, I have trouble getting myself lined up for whatever task. Another tedious element.I found this game to be more a test of my endurance and patience than actual fun."
5,SANDRA ROMPIENDO LAS CADENAS,"EL DISCO ESTA MUY BUENO SE LOS RECOMIENDO AL IGUAL EL SEGUNDO TITULADO LA OTRA.MIS CANCIONES FAVORITAS SON PA CURAR MI MAL DE AMORES, EL DUO DE EN BLANCO Y NEGRO Y DIME QUE MAS DEBO HACER AL IGUAL MEDALLA DE HONOR.ES ROMANTICO Y MUY BONITO ESTE DISCO."
1,RANDI IS A JEALOUS NASTY UNHAPPY MAN.,"If you are thinking of buying this book. DON'T BOTHER. It is useless and ridiculous, so don't waste your money. James Randi is clearly JEALOUS of URI GELLER because Uri has the power to do good in this world, where as Randi has only the power to put others down. What a SAD SAD man. I have never read such a BITTER and AWFUL book in my life as this.RANDI, YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED. You are evil on earth."
1,Nonsense,"This book completely fails to offer what is promised in its title. It is far too biased to be considered a resource for anyone, save one who wants to hear someone else agree with his position on the matter. The book is littered with misleading information and is at times barely readable."
1,This book is claptrap,"Seldom have I read a book that is so filled with garbage that purports to be ""facts"". Only a child would be pulled into believing the obvious rantings of a disgruntled magician that apparently fears the truth. I wish I could have given it ""no stars""; however, it may be a rather important book to those that would like to have an example of how innuendo and half truths can be used in an attempt to destroy the credibility of another human being. Claptrap it may be; however, I have it one my shelf as a reminder to be vigilant of those that try to undermine others' belief system with lies instead of truth."
5,a brilliant work,"I have seen both James Randi and Uri Geller in action. Where they do the same tricks, only Randi has the personal integrity to tell the truth. Geller would have us believe he is related to Freud, that he has the power to bend metal.... If Geller is so needy, and really psychic, why won't he allow himself to be tested under scientific conditions? Randi has a million dollar prize for anyone who can prove psychic ability. Three cheers (and five stars) for Randi's fab. expose! It is highly readable, entertaining, and a healthy dose of sanity in this ""new age""."
4,I kind of agree,"Well... I read it. Though not a literary masterpiece it made a lot of sense, but dispite the book and remembering watching the television set many years ago with my spoon and broken watch which was futile, there's still the imaginative part of me that wants to believe in Uri's magic. Yet the logical part of my brain has to go with the book and agree. I've gone on an official looking Uri website and discovered it's main purpose is to gain a few buck from sponsors. So my fantasizing has been shattered. My conclusion is to believe in the book. I have never received convincing evidence or proof from the books ""subject matter""."
4,"Dated, but very informative.","This book is not a new book, but it still is very informative about how Uri Geller uses simple magic tricks and EXCELLENT misdirection and theatrical techniques to dupe/fool/entertain those that follow after him.James Randi has done other exposure books, but this one is very to the point, and leaves no doubt as to Uri's ability to fool and entertain.It is the first book I give to folks that mention about spoon bending and other supposed psychic powers."
1,Great Size and Decent Sound for Price,This is simply good amplifier for starting out.......it is well worth the price if you have a hobby of playing the keyboard or guitar and want to see how well you play..........
2,Too many little pieces.....,"I realize the ad for this said assembly required, but when we saw all those little pieces and screws we couldn't quite believe how much assembly was needed. So I can't really rate how good it works, because it's currently being slowly put together. it's also very, very heavy."
4,Superb Organization of Ideas!,"The topics and concepts in this book are exceptionally well organized. After reading it from cover to cover, I could easily see how all the ideas and concepts fit into place. I have two main criticisms. First, the notation is sometimes non-standard, e.g. the r vector is used to denote the label vector and superscripts are used sometimes as subscripts. Second, the explanations are sometimes too brief. For example, when deriving the solution for Least Squares Regression with Quadratic Discriminants, Vandermode matrices are used but the author fails to identify them as such, or to explain why they are useful. If the author were to write an extra sentence on every other page, the explanations would be perfect!"
4,Good one to start,"I would like to congratulate the author on writing this book, which is crisp and covers whole range of topics. What I liked the most is a systematic disucssion on a wide variety of areas in machine learning with a certain degree of details.But at the same time, I will also say that the book at some places,(for eg the treatment of Multi Dimensional scaling and Linear discriminants analysis,) lacks depth in its derivations. Also if some explanatory examples are put,it would help the reader, who is doing a first time reading, in understanding the concepts.At the same time, I think the book achieves it's target of introducing to the reader, a whole gamet of techniques, at a fairly reasonable level. The book is no doubt, a nice and one-stop quick reference for many topics, as such. A commendable thing is an up to date errata maintained by the author, with latest editions made. I would recommend the book for a quick introduction to the subject."
4,Good overview of the field,I bought this for use as a reference book rather than a textbook. I found it quite useful with just one proviso: the mathematical presentation goes very fast in places and may be too concise for some readers.
2,Light on detail and lacking solutions,Nice breadth of examples of machine learning techniques but light on detail making implementation of the techniques difficult.There are no solutions to exercises available (except to instructors) so not a good book for self-learners.I recommend Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher M. Bishop instead.
2,Not useful as a textbook,"Looks like a textbook, but it's really more like a handy reference for machine learning theory. Every time I thought the author was about to actually show how to implement an algorithm, he'd move on to the next section, where once again it was essentially just another list of equations from the theory. I got through about 9 or 10 chapters, and still didn't have a clue how to actually do machine learning.Does anyone have recommendations for a book that actually demonstrates *how* to do machine learning? Like with real examples?"
3,Really an introduction,"I've read several parts of chapters which concerned my work and skimmed other chapters faster. This book should serve as a starting point and mostly as a quick introduction in a subject. However, i've found this book to be useful in other way - it is compact and I found several basic reasonements and assumptions quickly to base my conclusions in work i was doing. Also i like the style where key-words appear outside the text where they can be easily spotted and also the references at the end of each chapter."
4,A story that needs to be told.,"The article I read about the book is from the local county paper, The Independent Journal dated feb 6,1999. The author is interviewed and the conclusions are discussed openly.It is a great format for the book because each of the men going for the inventor of the mountain title are interviewed and quoted. I went to high school with the real inventor and hung with them. Read the book to see who it was."
1,A Cuban pianist without a clue,"As a Cuban myself, it's a recording by Cuban artists such as this who don't represent their music well that makes me blush with shame. Mr. Brito is such an artist. Go listen to Lecuona himself, or the incomparable series of Lecuona on the BIS label by Tirino. The tempi here are slow, languid, having more of a ""cocktail"" pianist kind of feel. Little color except one mezzo-piano throughout, little bite. The sound quality on the disc is a bit muffled as well. There are many other Cuban artists who run rings around Mr. Brito's Lecuona (Frank Fernandez comes to mind, or Paquito d'Rivera, another Cuban, on saxophone). When can only wonder having studied with Renee Touzet, a great Cuban musician, how this pianist conceived these lack luster, un- Latin performances-and living and teaching in Miami no less!I was very dissapointed with this one: I expected much, much more."
1,Stay away....unless.......,"I have never seen a book that loses so much with its translation. It's pathetic. You MUST stay away from this book, specially if you have the chance to read the Spanish version. Just an example of pathetic: The value given to treasure found by the Spanish in Mexico in early 1500s, is in US Dollars !!!!!!!!!Life is way too short. Stay away !!!!!!"
5,"HISTORY, ADVENTURE, THIS IS AN EPIC STORY!!","This is one of the best books I have ever read, Bernal Diaz provides in great depth the CONQUEST OF MEXICO and the fall of the Mexica(Aztecs). For anyone interested in Mexican History or the history of the Western Hemisphere in general, this is a must. The chapters are short and easy to read, as well as addicting, especially during the final siege of Mexico. This is a great book to read especially if you're from Zapotlanejo, Jalisco or from Norwalk, California. This book is a great stepping stone on the subject and one should also check out Letters from Mexico(letters from Cortes himself) and Broken Spears(the Aztec account of the Conquest). Orale!"
2,Doesn't deserve a space in an engineer's bookcase,"While the title is straight to the point and the cover is fancy, the content is very basic, very outdated (for a 2000 book) and very superficial. Inside, you can learn about as much as in an extended 1980's pamphlet advertising seismic isolation as a way to build stuctures in the future.Don't waste your time and money, choose another book to learn about seismic isolation."
1,Bell No-Mor Flats Bike inner Tube,"I am 5' 11"" 165 lb and I've ridden bike since a teenager.I thought this would be a good idea for my mountain bike but once installed to ride with them there was way too much drag. It would be good if you just wanted to workout and never go anywhere.I'm going back to inflatable tubes!"
1,awful,Worst biking experience ever. these tubes make it feel like riding a bike on half inflated tires. I could not ever recomend this product for any reason.
1,VERY heavy! Made it 3x harder to bike!,"These tubes are very heavy and make the bike a lot harder to pedal. I took it into a shop to see why the bike was so hard to move, and he said its the tubes. And to remove them, you have to cut the tires off because the airless tubes are impossible to take off without destroying either the tire or the rim!"
2,Careful - May be weight dependent,"Let me preface my review by saying that I am relatively tall and weigh about 200 pounds. I replaced both of my 26 x 1.95"" tubes with these.I had hoped these tubes would be adequate for riding primarily on the street and through the occasional thorn-laden dirt patch. I knew they would be heavier than a standard tube, but I also expected that they would be firm and usable. Unfortunately, it was like riding on flat tires, including an unpleasant squishy noise as I pedaled along. On the plus side, I got an excellent workout from a very short ride, as they probably doubled the amount of energy I might have normally expended.I think that my experience with this product might differ greatly from that of someone needing a smaller tube for a smaller rider. I would definitely not recommend them for adults."
2,Too much drag.,"I knew I was taking a gamble since the reviews were inconsistent. While I'm sure they would have eliminated the possibility of getting a flat again, they slowed my bike down so much it was like peddling through sand. On top of that they had a ""lumpy"" out of round feel to them. I was also afraid the beads on my tires were going to slip off the rim. They'll probably work in a utilitarian application like a hot-dog cart or wheel barrow but they're useless for a bicycle unless you want an extra workout."
1,Defective,"When I bought these at Best Buy a sales clerk told me they would not work well for audio applications, he had seen a lot returned. Since there was a rebate that made my cost [$$$] and I got the impression it was only when played in an audio CD player, I thought I would give them a try anyways.He was right. They are totally useless for audio and would not work correctly either on an audio CD player or in the computer CD-ROM or CD-RW players. If you can't trust them for audio, you shouldn't trust them for data. I would avoid these CD-R's."
3,Basic Dewalt battery.,Got his item to replace a 10 year old unit that has failed. It fits the driver and took a charge right away.
4,Dewalt DW9061 9.6 volt battery,Works good for a 9 volt battery. They all quickly develop a short life. I will get a high power drill next time instead of a battery
5,Looks good,Our mailman and our neighbors cannot get over it. They admire it even if they are not Raiders fans. Mailbox lused to be nondescript and now it is eye catching.
1,how not to write sex,"Out of 35 stories, I'd say perhaps two or three are readable. Not good, but not as bad as the rest. This book is simply terrible. I'm not sure what else to say about it that could accurately portray just how horrible it really is. The sex is not sexy. It's not erotic. The general idea of ""sexy"" in this book is using the 'c word' in a poorly constructed sentence or in a midst of purple prose or in a formulaic bland scene. The writing and prose is juvenile, boring and pathetic. If this were something someone posted online for fun, or fanfic, then it would be expected to be at such a substandard level. For being a published work asking people to pay for it, this book should burn itself in shame."
1,The tentacles!!! ohhh the tentacles!!!!,"seriously repetitive descriptions of ......everything, especially the sucking tentacles. While we've had our share of laughs, giggles still erupt ""inopportunely."" Thanks for nothin'."
2,average strap,"One of the leather pieces on the end is hard and lumpy, will scratch the hell out of a nitro finish, so no good for my guitar, very long too, the tweed feels alright, won't be keeping it though."
1,Don't think you're getting three straps as shown in photos!,"The Amazon advertisement and purchasing process for these strap(s) is VERY misleading and I'm not happy at all. No where in the description does it say it's only ONE strap, what actual color you'll get, that you are able to pick a color during the purchase process. The advertisement photo clearly shows THREE straps. I thought it was a closeout deal and I was getting all three straps. Now I'm thinking WTF Amazon?!!!"
4,nice but does get a tad gooey,"bought for my fiance for xmas. I bought one for him the previous xmas and it was extremely gooey and gross after 1 year of wear. this one says its the ""original"" duct tape wallet, promises not to get gooey and even has a lifetime guarantee! after approx. one month of wear, wallet is getting a tad bit gooey but overall it's very well made and he likes it quite a lot. wallet came with inserts which say if it needs replacement, just mail the wallet back and they will send you a new one. sounds like a good deal to me."
3,Interesting material but THICKER than I thought,"I was looking for a really thin wallet... while this material is pretty cool (looking), the wallet unfortunately is so bulky and thick that it's gone into my gift closet."
4,Cool Gift Idea,"My husband thought this was cool. He promptly put it in his drawer and hasn't used it yet. I got this in March and it's August and I'm still waiting. Men are a mystery to me. He says he can't use this wallet until his wears out. Gosh that might take another 2 years considering how he uses wallets until they are only threads left.Anyway -- Since my husband does duct work for a living, I thought this was appropriate. My only concern is that it kinda knicks easy. Just while handling it long enough to look it over and wrap it up, I managed to knick it a little on the outside. I'm questioning the durability. For that it looses one star.For coolness factor, it keeps the other 4."
3,Good product but has very large links,"This extender is a good product for the price. However, the links and clasp are very large compared to other chains I own and I couldn't use it on several of my necklaces because the clasp would not fit onto the smaller chains."
5,This is the dictionary I reach for,Imho the definitions contained within most accurately reflect the American dialect of English. Certain other dictionaries seem so far off base it isn't funny. An indispensable book. I wish there was a Windows version of *this* dictionary! Slang & jargon (historical & otherwise) are the main definitions I still need to occasionally lookup elsewhere.
4,I think this dictionary is good!,"As a English learner, I always want to have an excelent dictionary,this is a perfect one, it provides me enough words and explain them clearly. Maybe I can find most of the words I want to find.it also has interesting illurstions and maps.it cover various subjects such as science,art,literature,chemistry and others.I like this dictionary,I will use it for a long time."
1,Obscene slang defined,"I returned this book after I accidentally discovered that it elevates obscene slang words by printing and defining them. For example, the words,""f_ _k"", and ""motherf_ _ ker"" are both defined. What purpose can this serve, other than to encourage children to use them, with the justification that, ""they're in the dictionary""? An encyclopedic dictionary should PRESERVE language, rather than flow with changing mores."
2,The case?,"Well, I wanted something that was reasonable priced, designed to fit my E61i and durable. This case is all but the last. Here's why: the belt clip is solid plastic and not doesn't hinge. This makes this case just better then a $5 case, IMO (in my opinion). There are other cases on Amazon, such as theNokia E61i Designio Leather Case (Horizontal Flip Cover)that are about ~$10 more, but appear to be better built.I'm going to try to return this guy and get something else!"
5,Simply Beautiful and Beautifully simple,"I don't often give five stars, and had I rated Up after one listening, it would have gotten three stars at best. I'm glad I gave it a chance. Maybe I'm getting old, but I appreciate the evocative minimalism of many of the songs on Up. At My Most Beautiful is R.E.M. at their most beautiful. There are many other gems here, but it achieves it's atmospheric success as a collection. I'm always disappointed when I'm interrupted in the middle of listening to this CD. The songs on Up belong together. Peter Buck's sparse, restrained guitar work may not be appreciated by everyone, but it works - and when he does step up to deliver a few well aimed punches, the contrast is truly something special. Mike Mills again demonstrates his skills as an instrumentalist, but it is his backing vocals which give Up so much of its beauty. The lyrics are true poetry. Give this CD an honest chance; you'll be happy you did."
3,We Miss You Bill Berry,"And clearly so does your old band. UP certainly has some good R.E.M. grooves & inspired Stipe lyricism (Lotus, Hope, At My Most Beautiful, the great Walk Unafraid), but much of the album just drags.R.E.M. are in transition. That's not such a bad thing and this is still a ""good"" album, but it's not the usual Great Effort we're used to. It has its moments but it's not Automatic."
2,Know any other tempos guys?,"Here's the bottom line, Stipe writes very very weak lyrics...and the tempos are too similar. I wish they wouldn't have printed the lyrics.. better not to know. He occasionally writes wonderful words..but it's really rare...especially here. As an art approach, he's still weak as a writer..compared to beefheart or robyn hitchcock...their lyrics don't always make sense but their ideas are so unique and they flow.Stipe's lyrics blow.I like some of the songs despite that...I even like Airport Man. But God, I wish the lyrics were ABOUT something ...OR...interesting nonsense.Neither one!But, my hats off to any band that takes this many chances. I have taped my favorite tunes and will trade it in on the new XTC.SO, I like it OK, but it's not that inspiring.Maybe more listens will change that, as it did Out Of Time.We'll see."
5,"R.E.M.'s ""Up"" is a masterpiece!","Michael Stipe et al have done it again-""Up"" is a triumph, one of the most personal, emotional albums R.E.M. - or, for that matter, any artist - has ever made. It explores the possibilities of the sonic sound, and comes through bursting at the seams with energy and creativity. A well-earned five stars to the band, who have managed to pull off yet another phenomenal album!"
3,Rem gone techno?,"all in all, its a fair cd, though i dont approve of some of there suddenly techno appearences, leav it to the bands like crystalmethod, and dont mess with the rem formula thats been working for so many years!"
4,REM the best by far,"REM is a unique band, with unique songs... I would hate to die, knowing that their songs are still played... Keep on playing - we love ya !!!! I would like to meet them one day..."
4,Number one in Belgium!,"Hi, I have the impression that everyone is stunned by the new REM-single. On the best Belgian radiostation 'Studio Brussel' listeners have placed in on number one in their chart 'De afrekening'. Four weeks ago it reached number 12, then it climbed to number two. It stayed their for two weeks until finally it reached the sky last week. Let's hope the album will be as good as 'Daysleeper'!!!"
4,"different, not the best, but worth a listen","With the departure of their drummer, the rest (and some might argue the core) of REM took a different turn, making this album a crossroads of sorts. Their best was both behind and in front of them. UP is a picture of an uncertain future, which is what Stipe has been communicating for quite a long time. It is one of those ""takes a while to get used to albums,"" but the reward in the end (starting with ""Lotus"") is worth the effort."
1,Don't buy this album.,"Stipe moans his way through a collection of tuneless, whiny songs that reflect a lack of effort or talent. Stipe once imbued his vocals with an aura of quiet mystery, but now he's just whining; Mills used to contribute intricate melodies and harmonies, but apparently gave this album nothing more than some disgusting synthesizer grackle. Peter doesn't sound like he knows what he's doing.Do these guys really think this stuff is good? I wonder. You can sit back and listen to Murmur by candlelight, and it'll draw all your tensions out of you; this just grates on you until you finally get up, turn it off, and fling it out the window."
4,mellow electronic delight,This CD is listening enjoyment. REM's new mix of softer tunes togeter are a calmer version of their previous sound. Michael Stipes signature voice makes UP a pleasure to hear.
4,Not a classic but better than most of the stuff out there,Lotus is possibly the funkiest REM song ever. Very energetic and catchy without the blatant pop feel of Shiny Happy People or the classic but also stale REM sound of One I Love. Daysleeper continues the great tradition of Nightswimming. This album requires many listens but in the end you will crave the subtle melodies and suddenly you will find that you know every beautifully crafted word for every song. Thank God they didn't sell out and create a piece of garbage.
3,"UP? Sounds more like a ""downer""","What ever happened to ""Happy Shiny People""? Any release by arguably America's premier rock group is an event, but 64 minutes of moody new age keyboard music is a bit much. As always, there a few outstanding tracks (""Lotus"", ""At my Most Beatiful"" is Brian Wilson listening?, ""Sad Professor"", ""You're in the Air""), but on the whole, not an album I'll probably go back and listen to a lot. Note: I'm amazed by the reviews from REM fans (as I am) that are dated prior to the 10/27 release date...have these folks actually listened to the whole album? I can't believe they're all on Warner Brothers' mailing list to receive an advance of the masters?!"
3,Loss of Direction??,"This is the first time that an R.E.M. album doesn't grab me by the heart on it's first listen. Having read diverse interviews from the band prior to the release I can clearly see the Eno experimental influence and the need to look into new and diverse corners. They are a band that can now afford to do this having reached a pinnacle of fame and success. Still I see a couple of great songs (Lotus, Daysleeper, Suspicion) mixed with a series of lumped dark, non directional experiments. Bear in mind that I have only heard my copy four times after buying it so maybe their is a potential for growth here but at this moment I sense a loss of direction!"
2,past their peak,"REM is definetely one of my favorit bands of all time, but UP was a disappointment. It seems that UP lack a lot of the vibe that all four original members had toghether. The use of drum machines and synthesizers give a really wierd artifical sound to the band, a far departure from its more organic roots on albums like Green, Document and automoatic for the people. It's a lot harder to get into these songs."
3,It's depressing giving R.E.M such a low rating,"Oh, when I listen to UP, I long for the days of Green; upbeat ROCK! When I first got it, i was entirely disapointed but as i listen to it more and more, i like it more and more. It is though, still much slower then Green; the best album of all time.For anyone considering buying their first R.E.M cd, don't get this one, get ""Green"" or ""Automatic for the People"", they were the true R.E.M rock. For any true blue R.E.M fan, get this one, it's slow but it's the new R.E.M"
5,A brave new world for R.E.M,"I have been an R.E.M fan since their ""Green"" days and am normally acustomed to their more earthy guitar ridden tunes. Naturally when I first listened to ""Up"" I wasn't so sure that I had made the best decision. Once I cleared my mind of the way I expected the album to sound, I found that I really enjoyed it. The many experiments with keyboards and synthesizers were most interesting and the lyrics, as always, are just as intellectually stimulating as their last albums. It takes an open mind to enjoy the album but once you rid yourself of expecting it to be the same kind of work as they have done years ago, you will fall in love with it like I have."
2,poor effort,"i thought that i was such a great REM fan that i'd appreciate all their works but this album seriously isappointed me. lots of it is tuneless with few memorable tracks such as daysleeper, hope and why not smile. only about 3 or 4 songs are listenable, the rest leave a lot to be desired. i still believe REM's a good band, they just need to get their act together, with or without their drummer. automatic for the people and new adventures in hi-fi are still 2 of their best works."
2,"""Up"" does not measure up to previous R.E.M. efforts.","With few exceptions, R.E.M. albums grab the listener's attention from the first track and hold it until the very last note. Sadly, ""Up"" is one of the exceptions (along with ""Reconstruction of the Fables,"" ""Monster"" and ""New Adventures in Hi-Fi""). The sonic effects are more distracting than innovative, and the near-total lack of melody makes the band sound unsure and unfocused. In the past, in songs with virtually unintelligible lyrics or no lyrics at all, R.E.M. has proven itself adept at creating moods solely through music (e.g., ""Murmur,"" ""Automatic for the People""). Not so on the new album. R.E.M. offers plenty of distinct sounds, but they simply don't add up."
2,Grabbing at straws,"Disappointing...usually when a new R.E.M. comes out I listen to it a thousand times, commit it to memory almost. I listened to Up twice and then put it aside. There is some good stuff here: ""Daysleeper"" is superb standard early 90's R.E.M., ""Suspicion"" has a lush, twilight feel to it like ""Star Me Kitten"", ""At My Most Beautiful"" is okay second rate Beach Boys (not as good as ""Near Wild Heaven"" though). But for every good or even merely okay song there's another that's out and out bad, embarrasing even. Far too much Stipe. ""Lotus"" sounded good live but on record it's annoying. I'd say Fables of the Reconstruction was worse than this, but at least it had ""Driver 8"". Instead of UP R.E.M. should've named this Out of Ideas."
4,good enough,"This Cd is the same old R.E.M. we've always loved, just with less commercial appeal. It's a Cd that grows on you. Good overall. Worth the money a definite must buy for you R.E.M. fans out there."
4,A classic when you give it a chance.,"I'll be honest and say that I did not like this album very much when I first heard it a few years back. I thought it was REM's lowpoint and was boring. But through listening to it several times, I now rank this among one of my favorite REM albums. There are several songs like ""Lotus"", ""Diminished"", "" Falls To Climb"" and ""At My My Most Beautiful"", along with ""Sad Professor"" and ""Walk Unafraid"" that are some of my favorites and rank high on the list of REM songs. Don't buy this if you are strictly looking for classics like ""Losing My Religion"" and ""Man On The Moon"" or rockers like ""Maps and Legends"" and ""Drive"". But definately give this a try if you are looking for something new and want to brauden your sights when it comes to REM."
4,A stunning melodic effort,"Never been much of an REM fan but based on all the raves I have been hearing about from my peers, I thought I would have to check out what the hoopla was about over REM's last studio album. The first two tracks ""Airportman"" and ""Lotus"" didn't strike a chord with me. Those two songs could have easily been left off the album but for some odd reason the band decided to put the two most boring songs on the album. ""Airportman"" I found rather repetitive and annoying. After those two tracks, I started to enjoy the album. ""Suspicion"" and ""At My Most Beautiful"" really captivated my ears with the sparse melodies and beats, particularly ""At My Most Beautiful"". What strikes me about REM is that they never tend to repeat themselves with each album they put out, at least in recent years. ""Up"" is another album in 1998 which barely registered on pop music charts and with music buyers."
4,Give it time,"If you are looking for another Murmer, look somewhere else. Like Murmer, the album is atmospheric. But this one extends REM's progression from New Adventures in Hi-Fi with more soundscapes and layered guitars and keyboards, though many of the songs are instantly accessible, like Lotus. The band is getting older and I guess less inclined to rock out. The highlight for me is the final song, ""Fall to Climb,"" an anguished coda with Michael Stipe lashing out and pitying himself at the same time to a haunting melody that has REM stamped all over it. But as they are now superstars with no motive to make any more money, REM uses up its alloted time with its share of weak spots. But, of course, the good far outweighs the bad. Docked a star for its length. Up sounds like a collection of experiments, promonged by the 70+ minute CD format."
4,Fearlessly Different,"R.E.M has failed to come up with a bad album yet, but 'Up' is an admirable effort that is created without any thought of taking the band further into obscurity. There are some beautiful love songs like ""At My Most Beautiful"" and the haunting ""Daysleeper"". At other places they are introspective, trying to draw out the meaning of life as from a well. ""Hope,"" ""Lotus"" and ""Why Not Smile"" all seem to grapple with happiness and its attainment. 'Up' is evocative and perhaps more avant guard than the albums they came up during superstardom*, but their honesty is impeccable, even if the results of late are more uneven and sometimes less satisfying.*As if anything they ever did wasn't experimental or ground-breaking."
2,Berry's loss is felt more than anyone would've guessed,"Bill Berry was just a drummer, right? R.E.M. could handle his loss and continue on without much of a problem, right?Wrong on both counts, as ""Up"" proves.After Berry's departure, the band tries to make up for his absence by using drum machines and a strange techno type sound with dire results.R.E.M. is a great band and can do many, many things very well, techno rock, however, isn't one of them...especially when it's argumented with the awful orchestration and drippy strings that have ruined many a later day R.E.M. release. Only ""Lotus"" shows any hints of rocking at all and the fill-in drummer doesn't help the song any, it remains clumsy.There is good material here, but it's few and far between. This is far and away the worst release by the band to date and was a commercial failure as well..the band's first.For completists and hardcore R.E.M. fans only."
1,Yuck!,"I hate to say it, but this CD is as bad as today's Back Street Boys or NSYNC. What happened REM? Are you too becoming a corperate made-to-be group? Don't let the industry do this to you, pick up your guitar, bass & drums and PLAY SOME ROCK!"
2,This is what comes out when you get lazy!,"REM decided to do a record without a drummer, unfortunately the outcome was clearly not at their usual level. Also, composing an album with the three members in different places resulted in a lack of quality. The only song that is at the same level of some of their previous albums is ""Lotus"", the rest is just a way of filling some disc space, without any real inspiration. They made the same mistake with ""Automatic for the people"", but the songwriting there was a little better, here it is really terrible, and the musical arrangements are clearly awful"
1,REM has lost its edge and direction,"Don't get sucked into the hype surrounding UP. With Bill Berry gone, Michael Stipe and friends seem to be looking for a musical and artistic direction and did not find it. All the songs sound the same and Stipe sings like he's in a rotten funk. It's hard to believe this is the band that gave us OUT OF TIME. This is a disappointing effort."
1,Sounds like a band tuning up their instruments,"I consider myself a major fan of REM and own all of their CD's. All I can say about the latest offering is that I listened to it once and that will be the only time I listen to it. It seems like the old REM of Automatic For The People is dead and the ugly experimental REM of Monster is back for good. Experimenting is a good thing, I only wish they did it in practice sessions and actually bothered to write MUSIC for release on this CD. I guess the old addage that the older a band gets, the less energy it has is true, at least in this case. I wish I could return this piece of trash for a refund."
1,REM is dead.,"UGH.REM's newest ""album"" sounds like something thrown together by an incompetent 10-year-old kid with a synthesizer and an old guitar he doesn't know how to use. The melodies don't weave as they once did, the lyrics are flat, Mike Mills, the real musical talent in the band, doesn't appear to have had any role in this album. Step back and listen to it; try to convince yourself it's a new album from a band you've never heard before. Then listen again. It's a piece of trash."
2,Elevator music,"They should have stopped after ""Green"" - please retire gracefully before it gets any worse."
2,Up is so overrated I can't believe it,"I've been a fan from early on as well and felt that the band hit its peak with New Adventures (feh to you naysayers) and needed to stop with the records. I think New Adventures is their best Warners album and strikingly evokes sounds and moods from their entire career. Now there's Up, a tired hung-dog collection of played-out random verbalizing from some once scrappy musicians now leading the good life. They needed to take some more time off, get over themselves, and find some drummer that they could just jam with. Lotus hints at some new mellow funky sound but the rest is just dull prog-rock noodling."
2,uninspired,I simply am very disappointed in this recording. The lyrics are those of high-school student failing English Literature. Is that really a synthesized drum-machine on several tracks? Next time look under the Karaoke section in the music store. Up is really Down. A 5-star on the hypnotic (put me to sleep)scale.
5,Everybody hurts....but not REM!,"It's great. I can't help it, I don't care what everybody else says, I just love it. I heard their performance in Hamburg yesterday: I ate my heart out I wasn't there, but I felt evreything to the bone (and enjoyed it!). It just gor better by these live-versions. The only thing I'm not to enthousiastic about is the fact they printed their lyrics in the booklet. I know the album isn't like everybody expected from REM, but they shouldn't have thrown all their REM-ideals overboard! And anyway, who understands their lyrics anyway: make your own interpretation of it... Just listen to Michael's voice and weep..."
5,New and Improved R.E.M.,"This is by far R.E.M.'s most experimental album. The guys have done a complete 180 from past albums and perhaps from any other record ever done by any band. Tracks like Daysleeper and Lotus are definite crowd pleasers, but the band goes into a airy phase through most of the other tracks and it is here that Stipe's lyrics tell stronger stories than ever before. Definitely one of R.E.M's top three albums."
2,fading into eternity,"well..it was better than i expected, but this is far and away not their best artistic work. they have matured a bit, yet at the same time, take a step back. only buy this if you have an extra buck"
4,Strokes of brilliance,"From Murmur on, I've liked each R.E.M. album a bit less (Murmur being one of my top 3 albums of all time, it was hard to go up). The band's most recent stuff has left me cold, but I keep buying, hoping for a new album that speaks to me. I've found it in UP! I enjoyed it from the start (I hadn't heard a single cord when I bought it) and now love it. The passion and beauty of the songs remind me of why I fell for R.E.M. 15 years ago. This CD follows me from home to car, and I've played ""Hope"" about 20 times this week. Imagine how much I'd like that song if I really knew what Stipe was talking about! Thanks, R.E.M., for taking some chances -- and for putting out your best work in a decade."
5,One of my favorites!,"I've been an REM fan since I was in second grade, and I own seven of their CDs(and aiming for them all). Up is one of my favorites. Sure, it's different, but I think it was a change for the better. The radio singles don't even begin to do this CD full justice. If you're an REM fan, you should buy it- you'll love it, I'm sure."
4,New era REM looks UP,"What a long strange trip it's been. From never doing tours to kicking one off complete with brain aneurysms to today's band as a threesome. Unique album overall. Not REM's finest worksongs, but UP definitely has its place in the Stipe & crew repertoire. Lotus is all that and more. Then there are intermittent bright spots running through the fiber of rest of the album. Though there are so many songs leaving you wanting more. ""Hope"" starts off grabbing you w/ its originality & totally mystical, otherworldly lyrics then drops you hard on the blacktop when it gets lost with its cheesy reliance on drum machines. It has the feel of Hi Fi's Leave, but never makes the leap to achieve that dark mysterious wanting & overall brilliance of that song. Stipe, Mills, and Buck are still the best going out there, but we know just how keenly genius they can be and are left wanting with UP. Can't wait till their next CD though."
5,"Given Time, It's Amazing","I suspect those who have debased this album have not listened to it more than a few times. It is a a difficult album, not only because it's REM as we've never heard them before, but also because it's unlike anything we've ever heard before. I suggest several listenings with headphones before one is able to make an informed judgement on the album. There is an incredible quantity of sound layered on the album that is easily missed when listening on a regular stereo. After such listenings and some time, the album blew me away. I think it is one of their finest works; to be placed on the next pedestal below Murmur, Fables of the Reconstruction, and Automatic for the People. A very emotional album, but not as somber as Automatic. REM's genius is demonstrated as it continues to challenge itself and its listeners"
3,A bit tired perhaps?,"I've been a big fan (of the music) since the beginning. I've never been disappointed yet by a new REM release. I think I preferred it back when I couldn't understand what the Hell Stipe was saying, now not only can I understand him, there's a lyric sheet to boot! Anyway, having heard a bit of negative about UP, I put it on and thought, this ain't so bad. Then I grabbed another at random, turned out to be Document, put it on and realized that maybe UP is so bad, for REM (which still ain't so bad). It seems, perhaps, a bit tired."
2,"Depressing, just depressing","There's three halfway decent songs on the album (Lotus, Daysleeper, and Airportman), but the rest is just depressing. It is unlike their pleasant sounds of the past. This album will be an utter waste of your time and money, thank God I got it at a used CD place."
2,What Happened to R.E.M?,"What the heck happened to a band that used to have something to say and say it beautifully? More noodling garbage from a bunch of guys who are only interested in trying to keep up with true innovators.One review I read said that ""Up"" is the Sgt. Pepper to ""OK Computer's"" Pet Sounds. Bunk.""Up"" is what it sounds like when a band is running scared and out-of-touch with what made it relevant in the first place. Furthermore, if you're going to remake ""Suzanne"" by Leonard Cohen (""Hope""), you'd better have something to contribute to the song. Sadly, this is not the case.Fans have gotten used to thinking that everything R.E.M. does is manna from heaven. But with each new release, the band gets more and more obscure, the melodies get rehashed, and the material just gets weaker and weaker.What happened? Stardom and complacency, it looks like."
3,up is ok,"Up. the new album from REM is a little lacking. After the first note you wonder who is this? Is this REM? Yes this is the same REM you know and love! Everything you know about this band left with drummer Bill Berry. This is still a great album, but I think they should get a new drummer. Drum machines just don't sit well wit REM's style. This album is one you should put on while doing something.You would'nt just listen to it. It has some really good songs but also some really wierd songs. I was in the truck with my dad and Lotus came on. I said ""this is REM."" My dad said ""this is REM?"" The songs are good but still don't sound at all like them."
5,Great album for music fans and REM fans,I got this album and I just cant stop listening to it !I just thought I'd let u know that is is well worth buying.U wont regret it !!!
1,"Time To Break Up, Boys","Apparently Michael Stipe has decided he wants to be Natalie Merchant, and so here the band (who sound profoundly disinterested in these weak, watery, limp songs) presents us with an album full of whine. I liked Michael Stipe a lot better when I couldn't understand him. It's long past time for REM to break up, and this record is proof positive. I used to be an REM fan, from ""Murmur"" onward, but now I can't even listen to their old stuff, because their last 3 albums have been so embarrassingly bad. Give it up, guys, shake hands and call it a day. It's better to quit music altogether than to do stuff like this."
2,Finding Their Way,"Up shows R.E.M. trying to find their identity after the unexpected retirement of Bill Berry. For the most part, they are unsuccessful. There are flashes of what you'll later hear in the far superior Reveal, but just not enough to make it worth recommending. ""Day Sleeper"" and ""At My Most Beautiful"" almost save the day, but not quite."
1,Makes you want to drown yourself - yeeeech,"They get mopier and deeper in angst with this than anything I've ever heard. If you want to sit around and feel sorry for yourself - cry and feel pathetic - this is the cd for you. Otherwise, it might look okay hangin from your rear view mirror but I can't stand this whiny pathetic sorry type trash - What happened to this band? They used to be fun and energetic. They were GOOD to listen to. Now they're just pathetic - yeeeech"
4,A change...but still REM,"While it took a few days for me to digest this new REM album...I now find myself really enjoying it. It's sort of a cross between Adventures in Hi-Fi and ""Country Feedback"" off of Out of Time. I hated it at first, but the lyrics are great *as usual* and the mellow starts to seep in after you listen to it nine or ten times! So, I'd recommend it for die-hard REM fans...'cause it will take some patience to work itself into your head."
4,I miss Bill,"Though REM's newest songs are truly inspiring and very entertaining (plus I've found that they make great 'art music',) they are lacking in the heavy bass that I have come to associate with this exceptional group. Mr. Berry will be missed, espescially by yours truly, but at least in this experimenting, REM has shown that it can still hold it's own as one of the greatest music groups of all time."
5,Automatic For The People - Rearranged,"This reminds me so much of Automatic for the People, the melancholy is there, drenched in keyboards, strings and the lovely guitar given a good dose of feedback. This is really a great album. It buzzes all the way through your ears, it gives an imagery of a bee through a modern complex. The sound is identifiably modern, at the same time there are bits of dirt here and there which gives a very sincere melancholy feel.Highlights from this album include Daysleeper, a good choice for a single and full of emotions. Sad Professor shows Michael Stipe at one of his highpoints of emotional singing. Falls To Climb has a church and marching drums(the drums sound a lot like Portishead's Mysterons)This is one of the best of R.E.M. and it's my favourite release from 1998."
1,Annoying Keyboards kills it,"Change is not always good and this is a good example. For most of the CD there is a real poor use of keyboards that made me have to remove my headphones. There is an attepmt to delve into the use of more keyboards and it flops. They have always hit their stride accoustically, here they miss. Spend your money on early works."
5,A Phenomenal Album,"Although many people criticize this album for its lack of a top single, the musical content of the album is perhaps REM's greatest ever. Many of the songs are dark and brooding, yet extremely beautiful. 'Hope' is a wonderfully inspiring song, and possibly the album's best, but the whjole album rewflects the band's moodiness folowing the departure of Bill Berry."
5,"Two Thumbs ""UP""","I agree with many here who observe that this is a very fresh and ground-breaking album. It's melodies and production are exceptionally strong. I also agree with many reviewers below that it takes a few spins to get hooked (as does anything that's so melodically rich).But UP is *not* pop (I like someone's remark below, ""Buy ricky martin"" instead!). REM has already been top of the pops before, and I enjoyed those works too, but NOW they are free to ascend artistically UP to a level of musical self-actualization.... The result: the best album, in my humble opinion, of any I've heard or bought in the 90's.So if you appreciate strong melodies, but not with a ""pop"" or ""hard metal"" twist, then buy this CD. Especially recommended to anyone who liked Automatic (which I think is extended and far bettered by UP).Recommmded tracks: ALL (except maybe one), especially You're In The Air, Diminished, AMMB, Why Not Smile, Parakeet, Suspicion, Apologist, and especially Walk Unafraid!"
5,It takes a few listens,"I think only the Beatles (and maybe the Rolling Stones) ever wrote songs that a listener could really appreciate on the first listen. Other great bands take a few listens to appreciate. REM is one of them, and UP falls into this category. The first listen didn't impress me, but after listening to it at work about four times,I was hooked. It's five stars if you give it a chance, two if you don't."
1,R.E.M.- R.I.P.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Here we go again. The darlings of the music critics and college crowd have yet again come out with an album that is completely uninspired. ""Up"" is a terribly medicore effort by a once creative band. Michael Stipe is continuing his attempt to be a singer with a voice that is more reminiscent of a dying, or bleating at best, sheep. He was much more tolerable in the heyday of REM, when the lyrics were not discernable. Although Mike Mills and Peter Buck, the TRUE remaining musicians in the band since Bill Berry's departure, are still dependable, the album as a whole is an insipid effort to put one over on REM fans, a dwindling number to be sure as the days and bad albums go by. There is plenty of better music out there folks, that you can grab up for the holidays. It's better to spend your money on a recording of cats copulating than this album; at least it's the genuine thing instead of Stipe sounding like he's imitating them!"
3,good thing for the 2nd half....,"Too much ugliness with just nothing to really justify it musically on most of the first half, starting right with that horrid intro...Stipe and co. thankfully return somewhat to form as the disc goes on as a whole...Nothing too amazing, a few standout tracks touch on that elusive R.E.M. beauty that you have to always search for between the pretentiousness and unnecessary experimentation. If any band works best when playing the sincere card, it's R.E.M., they know when they are at there most beautiful.."
1,A complete miss,"I can understand when a band gets tired of producing main stream recordings to line their pockets with cash, but this one is just plain lousy. It feels a bit like something from The Doors without the emotion. Maybe some bad Brian Eno mixed in. Whatever they tried to accomplish missed the mark. I did rnjoy two tracks, Day Sleeper & Diminished. Otherwise throw this one out the window."
1,Disappointing,The only song that I liked was Daysleeper. The rest of the songs on the album were lackluster and uninspiring. I am a huge R.E.M. fan but his album goes off in a direction that does not reach me.
4,"great, but not necessarily classic","Simply put, UP is a great album and definitely worth the while. It has it's high points (Hope, At my Most Beautiful, Daysleeper) and it's lows (The Apologist, Airportman), but on the whole it's another solid album from what is quite possibly the greatest band of the '80s, '90s and beyond.Two things: 1) 'Hope' is based on the Leonard Cohen-penned song 'Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye,' in case anybody cares...2) If you haven't had the chance to see REM in concert, do. Words cannot describe the full power of a live show..."
4,Unfortuantely overlooked,"This album is a great listen: plenty of energy for background music at work; great subtleties for when you're just relaxing with the headphones on. As an artist, I can personally attest to it being a wonderful painting companion.Critically panned by many, Up suffers like Hi-fi for being too 'different' for mainstream audiences--surprise folks, REM makes 'alternative' music. I can't help but feel that reviewers had Top 40 REM (Out of Time, Automatic for the People) in mind when they first popped this disc in. Any other band producing something this revolutionary would be lauded. Not quite as strong as some of the previous albums, but certainly in the top 5 of the band's discography."
4,Experimenting and Different,"After listeaning to the album for a few times, I have only one recomendation to make: If you are an REM fan, who doesn't really like change and prefer their 80's style, listean to the Cd before buying it. It's slow, but good. It shows their interest in trying new things and experimenting with music... Listean to it firts so you are not dissapointed"
5,Wow.,"When I got home on the 27 and began to listen to Up, that's all I could say. Wow. Its been a week and half now since I purchased it and I must have listened to it at least twenty times or so and still can't get enough of it. I think that Up is probably one of, if not THE, best REM cds of all time. I still get blown away everytime I hear it. I still greatly respect Stipe and company for not selling out and consistantly putting out high-quality music. Have a great day. Afterall, Things are looking UP."
3,R.E.M. plods along! And offers little new.,"Oh, for the days when R.E.M. used to write dreamy songs with powerful melodies and a full sound. While this release has its moments, most of it comes off as sterile, plodding, and dry. Bill Berry's drums are noticably missing (see Sad Professor) and Michael Stipes' songwriting is missing that souther storyteller power that it once had (there are no Driver 8's here). This band, once the only staple in my CD player, has quit leading the pack and has settled into middle age. Here's hoping for a ""roots"" album where the band constructs songs based on powerful music, neat changes in tempo and melody, and effective harmonies."
3,pretty mellow!!!!!,"wow!!! this was a shock when i played this in the C.D. player this morning. its different! the songs are all good but a like more of the upbeat songs. The song ""lotus"" is really good."
3,They have done better,"Iam a rabid REM fan, but I think Micheal is spending way to much time hanging out with hollywood teeny boppers. I will always remain faithful, but go back to Athens Boys"
3,Good but strangely lacking,"Now I'm for change, but this album doesn't hit me the way the others do. The first four tracks are probably the worst songs they've ever done, but the next five songs almost make up for it. The Apologist, At My Most Beautiful, and Daysleeper especially are great songs but also not their best. They need Bill Berry back."
5,Fantastic Crime Show,"This show is just amazing. Taking place in Oxford, England, all the criminals are smart. Lewis is the lead in this show and he is an old school detective in an academic's world. Hatthaway, his partner, was an academic and is very well educated. As Lewis says in one episode, together they make a pretty good detective. The two partners have great chemistry, but their taste in women seem to be not so good. The crimes are complex and very difficult to suss out. If you are looking for a smart show, give this one a watch!"
5,excellent!,Was hooked on MORSE and love that INSPECTOR LEWIS is up to the challenge of following in those BIG footsteps:-)
2,Chapters are missing key scenes,I was disappointed when watching the pilot and the first 3 chapters of Series 1. Key scenes are missing and if I had not watched the chapters previously scenes that followed wouldn't have made sense.
5,Great Buy,I bought this as a gift and I'm sure when my mum receives it she would be delighted. She absolutely love these tv shows and she would like to spend some free time watching this whole collection.
1,inspector lewis complete set,A real shame it does not include cc.Its absence prevented me to buy it.Cc should nowadays be considered a regular feature
5,This is a treat for Hardcore Fans,"There is something about English Mysteries that appeals to me and the Inspector Lewis series is my favorite. Despite the fact that I am a fan , I think that I can say without prejudice that these are some of the best written mysteries on television. This is no simple whodoneit, but has complex plots and motives and you will find yourself switching from suspect to suspect until the very end which will often leave you saying ""I didn't see that coming"". I discovered these on PBS during series 3 so it was nice to go back to the begining and see the evolution of charecters and relationships. If you like British television, well written and with wonderful filming technique and quality and you like real charecters who are not super heroes, you should enjoy these DVD's"
5,Gift for mom,It was the best gift she got last year..now she can finally see how the many episodes she fell asleep on ended!
4,"Great music, but a little long...","This film is a little dated now. It was made in 1988. But the ambition of the film is to document every aspect of Hawaiian music and that's a tall order. You will see a taste of hula, slack key, falsetto and steel guitar. You also get to see George Kanahele, the Hawaiian music scholar who has passed away. The highlights are falsetto by the Ho'opi'i Brothers and Sam Bernard, slack key by Ray Kane, a song by Genoa Keawe and protest songs by Mike Kahikina.The downside is that the film is full of long sound bites trying to explain the the complexity and background of the music. Every Hawaiian music lover should see it, but have some coffee handy."
4,Very Good CD-Writer,"I believe this is a very good cd-rw drive, it has JustLink technology to avoid Buffer Underruns, is fast, quiet, excellent to rip audio (MP3s), however the HP software included is a little bit limited, and the package doesn't have an audio cable included, If you have Nero 5.5.5.1 or you can wait a time for another software like CDRWin or WinOnCD to support the device, then you will have a powerful combination of CD-Writer and Software."
5,Fobus Roto Right Hand Belt Holster Glock 36,"The Glock 36 slides in with a satisfying snap into the Fobus Roto. Does not slide around on an 1 1/2 belt; nor would it on a more narrow belt. Engineered to sit such that the whole hand can get around the pistol grip without repositioning. No worries about a dead run shaking it loose, but pulling it out is smooth and natural. Very secure and solid feel on the hip, with no unwanted wiggle. It ships with a slight forward cant, which this user will likely never change. Thoughtfully engineered and perfectly executed, this holster is ideal for the Glock 36."
2,Very Good shouldn't look old and smell musty!,I was actually disappointed in the copy of Gore Vidal's Lincoln that I received. It SMELLED terrible! Like it had been wet and then put in and attic and had visible signs of some sort of mildew. This book was rated Very Good. I would hate to see what they rated lower. Perhaps a visual image would have helped me understand the book's true condition?
4,Lincoln by Gore Vidal,"I have not had a chance to read this yet, however, it is in good condition and I can't wait to start reading it."
2,not what you think,"The only thing good in this movie was the scenary. The story sucked, and the sex was fake, the movie was a waste of money and time."
4,Good but not GREAT.,This is a lovely film but lacks that certain extra somthing that would make it a GREAT film.
5,tough as nails boots.,These boots are amazing the toughness is second to none. the leather is a little stiff but wear em for a week and you'll love them the ATS cushion is great and the grip is superior.
3,PROTECT FROM THIEVES,Item does its job by locking up your expensive bike hitch. Only thing is that the item will crack on very rough rides.
2,I should make these,It serves the purpose of securing your bike rack to your hitch but Thule is clearly bending us over without the courtesy of a reach around. Way over priced!!!!!! Next time I need a product that Thule is the market competing I will not even consider purchasing a Thule product.
3,Thule snug-tite,"I have started using this item when it arrived. So far it speaks for its design. You won't hear any rattling noise when you're driving along the road. But i doubt even if it is securely locked, this will detach itself with one blow from a hammer. I should say Thule's design was poor and it's pricey too for almost $50 - ."
3,Agreed. Should be included with Rack.,"Maybe at $10 this would be okay, but at $45, especially for a bike rack that already costs almost $400, this device should be included with the bike rack.It serves its purpose though, and at least the lock cylinder can be easily replaced with one from a 2 or 6-pack lock set so that all the Thule locks can be changed to use the same key (but that 6-pack lock set goes for an additional $45).Although no one should kid themselves that these ""security"" measures guarantee theft-prevention, they are all simply a deterrent against the quick ""grab-n-go"" low-life thief. Otherwise, no wise person should ever leave their expensive bikes on racks out of direct sight. In fact, they should double up their security measures with steel cable through all wheels, frames, hitch and a quality lock."
4,"Expensive, but seems effective.","Thule bicycle carriers have a threaded hole that can use either a hex-head bolt (provided with the rack) or one of these secure bolts to attach the bike rack to the hitch receiver.The Snug-Tite Lock has a cover that locks over the head of a stainless steel bolt to keep a thief from using a wrench to steal the carrier. It looks like it will stop casual theft by requiring a thief to cut off the cover before unscrewing the bolt.It seems a bit pricy for a lock, but the bike carrier is an expensive enough item to make some precautions worthwhile. I was able to save a few dollars on both the rack and the Snug-Tite lock by shopping around.After a few weeks of use, I found that the Snug-Tite Lock's bolt had backed out slightly from vibration, letting the rack become slightly loose in the hitch receiver. Application of a mild thread locking compound (Blue Loc-Tight or similar) solved the problem."
4,Works well,Seems expensive for what it is but does the job. Nice to not have to unhitch or worry about someone stealing the rack while on a ride.
2,Not worth it.,"As others have said, just go and buy at locking hitch pin for a fraction of the cost, or better yet, use a cable and lock which will be much more secure."
1,Waste of Money,"First, the lock fits very loosely on the hitch""pin"" (screw), so the unit adds noting to the stability. But, the real issue is though this lock will impede the removel of the hitch pin, security is an illusion. The upright assembly is held to the hitch with two standard bolts (nuts). So, with the lock, instead of removing one bolt (the hitch pin), you have to loosen two nuts and remove two bolts. You've really gained almost zero added security."
3,"Fits the Need To Have ""a"" lock","I bought this because I knew it would fit with the Thule Transporter Combi Hitch mount. It does.I equate the security to the degree a luggage lock secures a suitcase. It's ""a lock"", but honestly adds no real feeling of security...just that it's fastened and unfastened using a key.I did not know of any other options that I was sure would fit. If you want to just have a lock that fits...this will work. If you want some security, and have some time to explore other options, my guess is there are better choices."
1,Pretty much a waste of money,"We bought this to use with the Thule 665C Cargo Box. First we found it un-necessary (the cargo box has a bolt that would perform just as well).The ""lock"" end is cheap plastic with a junk lock that can easily be pryed off with a screw driver/lever or knocked off with a hammer.It is threaded at the bolt head end which provides additional security should the ""lock"" end break or fall off.It does the basic job a bolt would do.It does look nice even though it is extra long for 1 1/4"" receivers.All-in-all, if you like paying $50 for a bolt with a ""pretty"" plastic nut (lock) when a $5 bolt would do, this is for you."
3,Overpriced,"While it does support and secure the rack, it is NOT worth the money!!It is way overpriced for a hitch lock."
3,looks flimsy,i bought this because its an original thule lock for my bike rack but the lock seems flimsy and i'm not sure if it'll hold up when someone tries to steal my rack and bikes. only time will tell..
1,Made my own for $2,"MAKE YOUR OWN - This part is a total waste of money. I went to REI to pick-up this lock, when I asked the salesman the price he told me $50! I asked him why I could not simply use a small piece of chain to connect the rack to the trailer hitch. He told me I would be better off doing that and said just last weekend they had broken one off for a customer, with a single whack with a hammer (on the lock side which is thin evidently).I picked up a small length of strong chain for $2.09 at the hardware store, put it through an old bike inner tube so it would not clang against the hitch and used two old padlocks to lock the chain ends to the rack and the trailer hitch (which is bolted and spot welded onto the car). So please, don't waste your money on the Thule STL2 Snug-Tite Lock II, MAKE YOUR OWN!"
2,"Nice quality, but not worth the price","I purchased this thinking it would be an easier, quicker way to remove my bike rack, only to see that I would still have to use a wrench to remove it. If you're not familiar with a Thule rack, it doesn't use a hitch pin to hold it to the receiver, but uses a bolt instead. I was under the impression this lock would work as a pin. Slide it through and lock the end. Not like that at all. Go to a trailer store, buy a hitch pin that accepts a lock and walk out at least $20 better."
1,Way too expensive - create your own,"I just purchased the Thule 9031 bike rack and hated the thought of some thug making off with it by simply unbolting one bolt at the hitch so I considered the Snug-Tite Lock. When I found out that Thule is charging almost $50 for a bolt with a cheap lock on it, I decided to create my own solution. After a couple days thinking about it, I came up with a solution for just about $10. When you install a Thule hitch mounted rack, there's only one bolt that goes into the hitch receiver. This leaves you with a hole on the opposite side which is perfect for sliding one of those thin cable Master locks through. Simply slide the thin end of the cable lock (the male end) in through the hitch hole on the opposite side of the bolt that holds the rack to the hitch. Push the cable lock through the hole until it exits out of the rear of the hitch receiver, then just click the lock shut. Only about 10 bucks for the lock and probably more secure than the Snug-Tite."
3,Works like it should,I bought this pin along with my Thule Roadway rack. I used the regular bolt that came with the rack while this pin was on the way. Either one will work fine to keep the rack mounted. It is just that this pin has some anti-theft with the key'ed cylinder and would keep the pin in place if the threads ever loosened. I suggest using anti-seize on the threads and shooting some lubrication into the lock cylinder area. Although I feel that $40 is a bit steep.
1,Ridiculous,Ok people.. there are actually two bolts that hold your rack together. Why would this lock make your rack secure? Any idiot could just unscrew the other bolt and get anything you had on your rack plus most of the rack itself. This product is completely ridiculous. The design of this bike rack is very lacking. They should design the rack with security in mind and not charge extra for it. Seriously.. isnt that part of their job? Who would want to buy a rack that is easy to steal? If you bought this rack then you are much better off just using a chain and a decent lock to chain it all together and chain it down to your hitch.
2,waste of money,if you're using a cable to secure your bikes to the rack you're better off fastening one end to the trailer hitch and the other end around the bikes.
1,Not for Pilates lovers...,"My mother asked that I write a review of this product. I purchased this video as a gift for my mother and she was very disappointed! She says that for it to be a level 3, it is actually as easy (if not easier) than the level 2 she was doing..(my mom's words) The whole point of buying a level 3 video is to have a better, more intense workout than you were receiving at level 2 - and with this one did NOT do that!:("
1,NOT SHARP!,"These knives look beautiful, the block is beautiful but boy was I disappointed the second I realized the pairing knives wasn't slicing through my potato. Only after trying 3 other knives to make sure it wasn't just the one, I had to use so much pressure to even get one cut. Plus the serration leaves a horrible pattern on anything you cut...not good for any presentations you'd want to do. I am very very disappointed. I guess you get what you pay for. I'm going to trade up for a more expensive set with more ratings and good ones at that. Please don't waste your time on this set!"
1,Very poor knives,"These knives are useless. They slip off items like carrots when cutting. Anything else they tear, they do not cut. Also, six of the knives in the set are identical. The six are like the type of big steak knife they give you in a mid-scale restaurant. So you really are only getting a very limited assortment of knives. Also the edges on all knives are finely serrated in the same manner. There isn't a slicing knife in the bunch. There is a reason they sell for around $30. Save your money and buy something a little more expensive. Shame on Chicago Cutlery for selling this junk."
4,What a Blessing!,"I first heard this CD about 4years ago,I loved it! God has truly blessed these young men with the gift of singing. I am a praise dance teacher, and I made a dance to ""Fly Away'. Everytime I listen too ""So Cool"" it truly brings joy and the presence of God in my heart! But there is one thing that truly bothers me about the lyrics and that is there is no mentioned of the name ""Jesus""in any of the songs. There is something about that name that can't be replaced. Jesus name alone brings healing and deliverance and we Christians should never be ashamed of it. but still I do love the album keep singing for Jesus"
5,Excellent CD,"This CD is another one of Take 6's display of ""FLAWLESS"" Acapella, rich and unique sound, phenominal Contemporary Gospel/Jazz/R&B music in it's purest form."
4,The boys are back in harmony,"As a longterm fan of Take 6 (and a capella music), I was disappointed by their previous effort. It is so good to hear them back to their old form, making beautiful music with intricate harmonies, uncluttered by instruments. They've combined their old singing style with more mature songwriting to create a CD that is entertaining and, at times, amazing. Even the tracks that use instrumental backing are arranged to showcase their unique ""Take 6 sound."" I was almost ready to give up on this group, but thanks to ""So Cool,"" I'm a born-again fan!"
4,The title says it all,"So Cool is a winner. It's got almost every type of sound for the diverse listener. I adore ""Wings of Your Prayer"", ""You'll Be Waiting for Me"" and ""Love and Harmony"" because they have that R&B feeling. But any gospel music lover should like ""Everybody Ought To Know"" You can really go to church on that one!"
1,Not this time,"Back to their a capalla roots?? Not even close to the quality of their first album. The background instrumentation, especially the synthesized drums, took away so much from their unmatchable vocal quailty. If you get only one take 6 album, get their first."
5,Great Motivation!!!!,"After suffering a heart attack August 2000, the cardiologist said I needed to exercise daily. With our sportbrains, my wife and I have motivated ourselves to loss over 70 lbs combined. Best products on the market for motivation...."
1,Out of business - DON'T BUY!!!,"Sportbrain, Inc. recently went out of business. Their business model didn't allow them to continue operating a free online service. Without their proprietary dial-up service, the units are worthless.They desperately wanted to control your data (rather than dump the data on your own computer), but look where it got them.......Loved my Sportbrain, but alas, it is no longer..."
1,Sport Brain Bust,"I purchased Sport Brain ""Buddy Brains"" for my husband in June. Since that time we have enjoyed walking and competing together in our efforts to get back in shape. However, now that Sport Brain has gone out of business, we are unable to use these devices as we cannot upload our personal information to the web site. That makes these Sport Brains totally useless."
2,A nice wallet but the material isn't resistant...,"One month after the purchase of the wallet it started to suffer damages on the duct tape material, like pinchings! I thought that the material was resistant, but not at all..."

4,I got is quick,I got this replacement solenoid very quickly and it workd great. I will get it from the same place next time.
4,Bargain Bin,"I found this cd in the bargain bin at my local music store, 4 bucks, not bad at all. 2 guys one 1 girl from Long Beach, mid 90's, g funk beats and pretty dope material, Unknown classic as far as im concerned"
3,Detailed analysis of engine fatigue,"This book's main focus is how fatigue and stresses affect different piston engine components and how to determine which components are excessively worn and the symptoms of wear. If you're worried about ensuring that your engine makes it through TBO, then this book might serve you well.Some of the material is dry and might work as a sleep aid if you've been suffering from insomnia. You won't find this sort of detail outside of a mechanical engineering class and definitely won't find it in other powerplant publications. However, this book is not much of a reference for rebuilding techniques or procedures. Helpful sections include an explanation of different effects of oil types and viscosities. In short, the book is priced right considering the information it contains."
4,Excellent lens for the price,"For the price this is an excellent lens but did a side by side comparison with my higher priced Tamron 2.8 17-55mm and there is a clear difference in sharpness and contrast so don't expect perfection. If you're extremely demanding then spend the money on quality glass, but if you're a casual shooter and want to save some $$ this is a good deal and great for every day photography. (see samples in Gallery)"
3,Didnt fit my Sony Alpha,I brought this for my Sony Alpha camera but for some reason it didn't fit. So I had to return it.
2,Very poor functionality,"Have had this game for 4 days and it's miserable! The sound didn't work right, finally got that fixed (through DirectX controls), game freezes up (has been reinstalled and still does it). Game is NOT intuitive and characters don't tell you what to do or how to get somewhere else. You have to sit through random movie clips and are unable to skip them to move on in the game. The ""read me"" section describes what to do in different games, but we can't figure out how to get to those other games. This is a very poor excuse for a game on Disney's part. I have PC games from 1995 that are much more kid friendly than this. My 3-1/2 year old son is just frustrated by this game and so am I! It is bound for the trashcan."
5,Everyone just getting out on their own should have one!,"This book is just wonderful and I'm sorry to see it out of print. My father handed his copy down to me when I went away to college, and it has certainly seen plenty of use, now with duct tape on the binding and personal family recipes in the margins. For someone like me, who is intimidated by fancy recipe titles and esoteric ""gourmet"" ingredients that seem all too common in cookbooks these days, this book is a lifesaver. It contains simple, classic recipes like sloppy joes, french toast, meatloaf, and deviled eggs, as well as guides for meal planning and how to stock your kitchen - both in regards to tools for cooking and basic staple foods. The language is easy to understand, both within the recipes and in the appendices, which include helpful tips from how to serve wine to emergency substitutions to sample menus for a variety of occasions."
1,not as described,"this is a core set with 6 booster packs of cards, not 36 packs of cards. Kit contains 6 booster packs, land cards, boxes, a die, and a rule book. It is not 36 packs of 15 cards as described."
5,Intriguing insight on an undervalued heavy.,"The Short Stirling and its role in the '41-'45 bomber offensive is often forgotten. The creation and exploits of this impressive aircraft are descibed in a pleasant manner. A great amount of interesting illustrations is included. Quotes from crew members take you back to the excitement and terror of the missions flown far into occupied Europe. The only item which is somewhat left out is exactly how the mounting casualties forced the plane out of the front line.All in all, a worthy book for any aviation enthousiast!Arnt Offringa (Netherlands"
3,Worth a look,"Written over 150 years ago it's perhaps a testimony to the quality of the book that it's even readable today. The quality of the characters I think is excellent and reveals many of the issues and challenges of the time, wealth and poverty, Gentlemen ""buying"" commissions etc. The dialog on the rights of man get s a bit tedious, and it's hard to imagine anyone getting away with anything like ""our Hero"" did ( 8 thousand pounds a year or not!), but its easy to see the genealogy of all subsequent books (Hornblower et al). Overall for fans of Naval history and literature worthwhile"
4,"You'll actually laugh outloud during this ""naval adventure!""","Extremely witty book! The story follows ""Equality Jack"" Easy, a Midshipman with a rather unusual philosophy. Yet, while you're laughing, you get a good taste of what life was really like on a British man o'war. Marryatt lived these times, so writes of them better than any of the others. But you should also read: Horatio Hornblower, Dewey Lambdin, and Patrick O'Brian."
2,Dated by today's standards,"This book has been a mainstay in Communications Theories courses in universities across America for most of the 21st century thus far, but it hasn't been updated much since its original publication in 2000. For a book that talks about Mass Comm. theories, it still provides a solid foundation as far as the histories of many theories go, but much of Severin and Tankard's commentary on technology (specifically the Internet) is laughably outdated. It makes me wonder how much progress has been made in the field in the 12 years since this book's initial publication.Buy it if you must, but know that there are more up-to-date resources out there that deserve to bump this dusty tome from its revered position among college faculty."
3,Spiritual LIte for the New Age,"I picked up a copy of Together Again to spiritually discover the essence of the male-female love relationship in the New Age. I must admit that I was somewhat disappointed at the poor editing of the book and felt that 100 pages of this effort could have been deleted to the satisfaction of most readers. I could relate to Dennis and Alice's relationship through having felt metaphysical experiences in my own life. Together Again provided me New Age labels to help me define life on the other side. It also enabled me to rediscover spirituality, which had gone wanting in my own life. Hopefully, the authors will get a bonified publisher for their next work so that the reader won't have to trudge through superfluous sidetracks."
4,Seek and Ye Shall Find,"Recently I searched for ""Dennis Jackson"" using Google. I did not know I would find this author; but when I did, I was curious about the book. Curiosity got the best of me, and I ordered the book from Amazon. I am a chronic proofreader and am fanatic about punctuation, grammar, and sentence structure. However, I became engrossed in this book to the point of overcoming my obsession with proofreading. What a beautiful story of two people willing to share their true natures! The authors' definition of twin souls differs from my own (i.e. two souls created at the same time and sharing many lifetimes together but not necessarily romantically involved). The two authors told their stories exceptionally well, keeping my interest throughout the book. I am definitely looking forward to their next book, The Psychic and the Lawyer."
3,A view from a skeptic,"I have to say I only read this because Dennis is my cousin. This book has made me think, ponder, wonder, and even ask questions. It is a wonderful love story. It shows that when you think that all is lost, there is the chance that you can have it all again. Love is the most important factor in life. Thank you for showing me that true love can conquer all. Even if you don't believe in people being ""Pyschic"", this book is enjoyable to read. There is alot of love there, showing people that you can always go forward with life no matter what path you may be on."
3,Fun story about love,"I enjoyed the interesting stories about Dennis & Alice and their search for their twin souls. Their stories were fun and adventurous. I did have a hard time reading it though, compared to the Celestine Prophecy which kept my interest. Dennis & Alice sound like wonderful people and I'm glad they shared their story."
1,Flimsy,"Who ever put this gadget together do so with ""a twist"". (And I don't mean with some flair). They mangled one of the rods that make up the handle. The product is a great idea, but its not worth the price if it leaves the factory damaged. Also, the metal was not identified (stainless? Aluminum?) No idea if it was rust resistant or not. I sent it back."
4,so much better than a bowl,This is a nice option for organizing your lid parts. I was previously using a crock/bowl type dish to hold everything and lids were overflowing and spilling out. This rack has helped clean my previously messy lid storage right up!
2,Great Idea - Bad Design!,I ordered this thinking it would an asset to our canning supplies...turns out it's not so great...you have to use a pretty deep pot to heat up your lids. We ended up setting it in the canner which I believe is probably the initial intent.I use a small sauce pan so I can carry it to where I'm filling and preparing my jars.
5,Lid Rack,Received on time as promised. Discovered during first use that the rack needs to be loaded with lid seals facing handle (allows for lid removal with magnet wand).
4,much easier than the way I used to do it.,The only reason I give 4 stars is you needed a deep pot to submerge the lids when in the rack overall great though.
4,might sem silly,"Might seem silly, buying a special rack for jar lids. I mean they have those magnetic things and whose adverse to a little pain from boiling water, right? Have only used once, so far. Happy with purchase as canning season is here, fact bought another one in the event one of my kids think-hey good idea lets take Moms. I'm not a huge canner like when kids were small and my garden big. But I like my own fruits and jams from summer. My son lokes pickling just about anything, my girls whatever the mood strikes. SO LOVE this product. If you are a big preserver its a good thing to have."
2,Not really a necessity,"In all honesty a magnet works a lot better. You can get a pocket tool pickup magnet for about $4 at the hardware store.This is nice looking and well made and that's what got me to buy it. I'm used to putting my lids in a pot and taking them out as I need them, and I found I didn't have a pot deep enough to completely submerge the vertical lids. Well, I did actually, but I wasn't interested in filling my stockpot for this!"
4,Convenience gadget,I found this useful for holding jar lids. It's easier to pull them out with a magnet wand when they're already upright.
5,Norpro Canning Lid Rack - Very Useful,More convenient than digging around in a pan for individual lids - which always manage to stick together. Definitely easier than using a magnetic wand.
4,Wow,"This is a wonderful return of the series to it's roots. At least for the most part. There are shadows of warrior within but not many. YOu do have to do the dark prince bit. THese parts are fun, but nothing compared to the brilliance of The light prince parts. The light prince parts are just like sands of time. THankd Goodness. Only this time they are better and prettier. yes, I said better and prettier. This game is well worth the price of admission. Buy it and you will love it. THE GOOD PRINCE IS BACK."
2,Not what I expected,"I'm not usually very harsh in my criticism of CDs. I realize music is subjective, and one person's trash is another person's treasure. HOWEVER, this ""steel drum band"" CD turned out to be a single steel drum playing over top of a ""drum machine"" (stiff MIDI sequences utilizing low-end sound libraries, for you musicians out there). Actually, I'm not even positive that the steel drum is live, it might be MIDI (fake) as well. The guitar sounds live, and the player likes to insert solos as often as possible, as though he's a frustrated guitarist who is using the lure of ""steel drums"" to trick people into listening to his guitar solos. I found this CD to be very disappointing."
1,BURY IT AT SEA!,"This is standard fare. Any film, story or book with the world's most famous twins is predictable. Everything will come up roses. This is no exception. One point of distinction is the songs are worse. ""Who Would You Be"" is by far and away the worst. ""Who Would You Be A Kennedy"" is stupid and insulting. That lousy effort should be buried at sea."
1,barely audible,"i love the stooges/iggy but when it comes to bomp records.buyer beware.this cd sounds like a tenth generation copy.dont take the chance.rocon@nb.net.and also ,notice cant find sound samples anywhere."
3,good size and easy to handle,"bought 2 of them and the bottom of one of them has not been ground ""flat"" meaning it wobbles on the sauce boat saucer. minor thing, but quite annoying."
5,A Book from my Youth,This was my favorite book in Junior High and I am now over 60! I bought it and read it and enjoyed it again! Great seller! The book was in perfect condition and arrived very quickly. A very satisfactory transaction
3,pot and lid rack,"The natural is very light, too light for my needs. We sanded it down and put a darker finish on it to match our kitchen better. For the design and quality, I felt I paid too much. It does serve the functionality that I ordered it for (keeping many of our pans and lids untangled from the cabinet) but I wish I had ordered another."
5,Very ingenious solution to storage,"I bought this pot rack along with the stemware rack by the same company.Hanging Wine Bottle/Stemware Rack-Birch- (Natural) (3.25""H x 32.5""W x 12""D). This item is easy to put together, requiring no tools and little mechanical ability. It holds together by means of slots and gravity, and is surprisingly sturdy. It is so nice to be able to store my lids in the same place as my pots, and it looks charming as well."
4,Who Can You Trust?,"That is the exact same question Jack, Eddie, and Julie in the book "" The Freshman Detective Blues"" had to answer when a skeleton was discovered in the lake at the Grizzly Creek Marina Resort at which they lived, and their answer to the question was ""no one.""When Eddie and Jack found a body in the lake, all of their friends and family that lived at the resort became suspects in a murder case. With a little Columbo style detective work, Eddie, Jack, and Eddie's sister Julie work together to get the facts about was at Grizzly Creek Marina Resort nine years ago. They use the facts to find out who could've dumped a body in the lake.I personally liked this book but I was kind of disappointed at the same time. My disappointment came when the author left out gory details when talking about the bank robbery and when Eddie and Jack find the skeleton in the lake. So if you can do without too many details, you'll like this book."
2,"Mites, mites, baby...","The authors start off be railing against something they call ""vertebrate chauvinism"". OK, so just because Proctor and Walter didn't get their research grant this year, just because they are stuck in their bug period, just because the world at large finds apes, lions and Timothy Treadwell a trifle more interesting than ticks, we are VERTEBRATE CHAUVINISTS.Nice try, Walter.Next, we are treated to an extremely technical, non-popularized book filled with weird words no human vertebrate can possibly memorize. I feel sorry for the anti-chauvinists who have to sift through this at their evening classes.No, this is definitely not a good book, unless you're grandmother was a tic. Which she wasn't (trust me)."
2,Practically Unreadable Format,"Trollope's first novel is an interesting if troubling study of the predicament of heavily indebted Irish landlords in the 1830s. The book's no-frills format, however, makes the act of reading a real chore, as it is set in courier in an ungainly 8.5 x 11 inch format. It is published by Filiquarian Publishing and distributed under the GNU Free Documentation license. I like the idea of making documents in the public domain widely accessible, but would it have killed them to set it in a more readable typeface?"
2,Get a better book than this.,"Although there is a lot of information in this book if you're willing to pound through it, I wish I had never bought it. It is extremely difficult to find information. Mine has a broken binding from having smashed it against the wall out of frustration. Thank your lucky stars this one is out of print."
1,"save your money, do not buy this book",Never have I spent so much money to get so little information. The color plates in the center of the book were worthless because of the poor quality of the printing. And the companion web site is not to be found.
1,901?,"How can a book be 901 pages? Every ""page"" is two sided, therefore, there must have been 902 pages. Or possibly more to have been printed efficiantly. DPC"
1,too little real content to be complete...,"The title sounds great: ... the complete guide. After reading it for a day, I wonder whether the author was plannig writing an sequel to make it complete. The book is a complete disappointment! It's shallow in every topic. For instance, the chapter on web graphic technology sounds like a paid ad. for photoshop. No real reasons were given on why photoshop is great compared to others, only a handful of quotations from other people. The book skips totally about other tools for graphic design. The chapter on web programming is impossibly pointless. It tries to cover a bunch of web languages in 30 pages, and over half of those pages are taken up by half-page sized screen shots that offer little information.The book is a complete disaster: it's incomplete, shallow, and full of useless opinions and quotations."
1,Truly an awful book.,"Molly must have got paid by the pound to write this book. If something can be said effectively in 5 pages Molly will spend 100 pages on it. I've spent a lot of time after reading 3 chapters for an assingment going back and reviewing them, looking at what I highlighted and trying to figure out what the point was. Much of the book consists of examples - full pages of text in some gibberish (not real words) with a few HTML keywords, then the next page shows what it looks like on the screen. There must be 100 pages of comlpete gibberish. There is a big section of color pages in the middle of the book, (a ""Color Reference""), but the colors aren't right-someone didn't communicate properly with the printer. I could go on and on but let me cut it short and give you some advice - If this book is required for a course, take another course. If it's a required course, take it at another college. If you have to take it at your college for your major - change your major."
2,Not what I expected,"From the very beginning of this book, I was bored! Some of the stories took to long to get to the ""erotic"" part. And I know this type of book is suppose to be for the sexually liberated, but I wasn't feel ""The Shower"" story,I just can't get with the male on male stuff. I skipped around the book to see if maybe it was just the first story that was boring...wrong! Even though Zane's name is on this book and her books are usually really good, I wouldn't waste money on this."
3,Not my favorite flava...,"This one was okay. I wasn't quite so captured by most of the stories by the no-namers, and yes, the erotic story lines took time to jump off in some of them. If Zane thought these were the best out of all the tales submitted to her, I guess the rest were absolute garbage. Zane's Flood stories at the end were a bore as was the story about the ""treats""... Zane should have perhaps mentioned on the back cover of the book that some of the stories were about same ... sexual encounters since that is an entirely different type of flava..."
5,This book got me into trouble too...,"And I am very hard to please. But I read it and hubby was like what is wrong with you, so I let him read a story and he was like yea Lets Get It On.Please keep writing, excellent work"
4,Open With Caution,"You might burn your hand when you open it, it's just that hott. I know, it sounds lame, but it is the truth. When they say erotica, they mean it! It wasn't quite what I was looking for, a little too heavy for me (lol), but it was still a good book if erotica is REALLY what you're looking for. Just be prepared (in more ways than one) ;)"
5,Finally!!!!,"I remember a friend lended me this book, I couldn't finish it but I decided to buy my own. I love how there are different authors in this book and how zane also added her own stories. A MASTERPIECE!!!!!"
2,OK,"I haven't finished reading this book because I can't get into it. Some of the stories were ok, others were just plain boring.I wouldn't recommend it."
3,its ok,i first read carmel flava i was shocked. i was at work and couldnt wait to get home. that book is something else. i had to get chocolat flava also. its ok but i love zane books
1,Hold your nose !!!!,"...cause this is garbage! Zane had me hyped after reading her introduction of this book. She claims she is immune to erotic literature because she writes it and she was compelled to put this piece together because it turned her on. From the reviews before me, many seem to think this is an excellent book. If the remaining stories after the first two stories are excellent, I'll never know."
4,hot-n-heavy,this book was really hard my soul stirred! This book brought out points in common relationship that no one dare to discuss.it hints on sexual escapades as well as the most indepth fantasies one can imagine having.got me started! can't put it down sometimes!
5,Hot,"This novel will set you on fire!!! You cannot read it from cover to cover without a station break (and that not due to the lack of time to read but the fires that you have to put out-if you get my drift- before you continue reading). This was a well written series of very exotic stories. The arthurs were creative and some romantic enough to draw you totally into the story. Robert Scott Adams, I can wait to read more from you. Zane, keep it coming girl!!"
2,A Big DISAPPOINTMENT!!,I thought this book sucked!! Please I wouldn't allow anyone of my friends to purchase this book because I did and I thought it was a mistake. I absoutley love ZANE but I really hated this book she really diasppinted me with this book she was trying to hard to make become something it is not I only love 1 story out of that book and that was it that's pretty sad coming from ZANE.
3,It was ok...but I think both Sex Chronicles were the BEST!!,"Well I was hoping for this book to be even juicier than the two Sex Chronicle books. I can understand that different authors put their own stories in the book, but Zane should've just put her own stories and made it her third Sex Chronicle book."
3,OK,This is Ed Wood's Last film. As you would expect from Ed. But actually has some plot. Well...... You do wonder about Rock Cartright though????
5,Loved it!!!,"I don't know why people slammed this book, I loved it! I saw the Lifetime movie of it first and loved the story line, I bought the Kindle book and I am so happy I did. It is the first book I have read by Picoult and it won't be the last. Love the story line of the individuals in the book, love how the chapters are shorter. I was cheering for Addie and Jack all through the book and loved them both!! A great book!!!!"
2,Didn't finish,"I have never read a Jodi Picoult book before, but this one came highly recommended by a co-worker and a book club member, so I took it on vacation with me. I stopped reading this half way - I just couldn't take it once Jack got arrested again. Too predictable, too weird, too boring. The Hawthorn rip off was just so obvious. I thought I might pick it up again to finish it, but there are just too many other good books out there."
4,"Quirky Town, Good Read","This is my first Jodi Picoult novel. I wasn't sure if it was a junior novel when I began reading it, but after awhile, it didn't matter. Salem Falls is a small town that thrives on gossip and drama. A mysterious stranger comes to town and everything starts to go downhill. One woman pretends her dead daughter is still alive, and the town teens are into Wicca. (kind of a cliche, imo...). The story is a page turner however, and the mystery comes alive. I do think the ending was a bit rushed and a bit of a let down after all of the build-up. I wish that the girls' reactions would have been explored further in the second half of the book. I am glad I discovered this author, and will read her other books. I do recommend this for older teens and think they'd really like the story."
5,Another winner!!,"Jodi Picoult has become one of my favorite author's after reading My Sister's Keeper. This novel, like her others, captured me from the very beginning and I couldn't put it down. Like some of her other novels this has a little twist at the end which causes you to look at the story in a different way. I've managed to read all but 3 of her novels now. I'm not one to follow any particular author but Jodi's technique has me captured and I can't wait for her next novels. I find it had to believe that everyone didn't give this book a five star rating. Give it a try. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
3,Mystery and Intrigue,"This book has a little of everything: romance, intrigue, witches and a courtroom battle.While I liked this book, I did find it to be somewhat predictable. I knew the ending before I reached it but Picoult has a way with telling a story.I found Jack to be an interesting character, a man with a past he cannot escape. His love interest, Addie, has her own haunting past. They were probably the most developed characters in the book. I found the teenagers to be a little too superficial, they just didn't come across to me as very realistic.I plan to read more from this author, especially her newer releases. For one of her better stories with a courtroom drama, try reading The Pact. It won't disappoint."
2,Disappointing!,"I was so keen to get started on this new Jodi Picoult, that I actually started reading it in the store before I bought it, so you can imagine my disappointment when I got down to the serious business of reading it! I found the story line predictable, the characters very flat, and overall, the whole novel was pedestrian. The ""made for t.v."" version of Wicca that was presented in the novel did nothing to improve my view of the story, and generally, I would have expected better from a writer of this calibre."
3,Rushed ending,"I am a big fan of Jodi Picoult, but this was not her best. As another reviewer stated, there were no surprises. The book was pretty predictable and the ending seemed very rushed!"
2,"Interesting subject, but sloooooow!","I rarely set aside a book without finishing it, but I am sorely tempted to stop reading this one. The writing is so-so (significantly more telling than showing), the plot fairly predictable, and the characters shallow. Worse still, it is boring. Perhaps it would be good for a leisurely vacation read. I realize that I am staking my review next to the Amazon's #1 reviewer(!!), but I wanted to give other readers an alternate opinion."
3,Too much like Alice Hoffman,"With the implausible witchcraft stuff, it seems like Jodi is trying to be another Alice Hoffman with the otherworldness. So far, The Pact continues to be my favorite Picoult book. I have gone on to read others but by far that is the best!!! Keep trying Jodi!!!"
4,Pretty Good.,"I only ordered this book because it was by Jodi Picoult and I LOVE her work. It was typically along the same line as her other books. I read it in about 2.5 days and I found it pretty much easy to guess what happened at the end. Yes, there were some twists but overall it was pretty much easy to figure out. I liked how she talked about the relationship between Jack and Addie, Jack and Roy, Roy and Addie and the quartet of the Wiccan girls. Overall I gave it 4/5 stars."
3,"3.5, Just An OK Book","This book was fair. The story moves along until the Wiccan theme takes over. That is when the story lost my interest. The whole idea of the group of girls casting spells, etc. was just to bizarre. I think it had a negative effect on the story.I would not buy this book. Get it from the library."
1,Not what I would expect from Jodi Piccoult,"I've had mixed experiences with Jodi Piccoult. While her books ""19 Minutes"", ""My Sister's Keeper"" and ""Plain Truth"" are some of my all-time favorite books, this is the second one of hers that I have not liked at all.This book has characters that are difficult to like, a story that ranges from uncomfortable to downright ugly, and a plot that plods along too it's invevitable and predictable end.If you would like to try Jodi Piccoult, try one of the three books above, and you won't be sorry. If you start with this one, I'll guess you'll never read another one of her books."
5,tantalizing,This book was a treasure to read.. It was full of twists and turns. Jody Picoult writes with such compassion for people who are victims of a judgemental society. She forces you to re-evaluate your own misconceptions of human errors.
3,Don't rush out to buy this book,"I picked up this book in desperation because I had nothing to read. Although I wasn't thrilled about the topic of teenage witches, it actually was even less interesting than I thought it would be. Just too ""teeny-bop"" if you know what I mean. A few things were interesting like Gillian's abuse by her father, and how it influenced her, but never really explored. I had to skim through parts just to finish it."
4,Enjoyable as usual,"I have read ""The Pact"" and ""Mercy"" by Ms. Picoult and I could not wait to read ""Salem Falls."" I thought the writing was wonderful, as usual, and I again found myself unable to put the book down as I felt with her previous novels. The only disappointing part was that the story was pretty predictable, unlike the Pact where it was a surprise ending. But for Picoult fans, such as myself, you will still enjoy this book and it makes for an interesting story of character building!"
5,Another terrific book by Jodi,"I am becoming a real fan of Jodi Picoult. Her style of writing grabs you on the first page and continues to hold your attention until the very last page. I enjoy the stories and getting to ""know"" the people. This story was about true love and devotion in spite of all ""odds"". It was a quick read, couldn't put it down---as is the same with all her books.Another great book by an outstanding author."
2,"Formulaic, cardboard characters","What a disappointment. I've read many of Jodi Picoult's books and loved them. Salem Falls is completely plot driven. The characters all fall into place in a direction, but they have no depth. I wish i knew more about Jack St. Bride and Addie. What does Addie look like, sound like, think about other than Chloe and her father? why does Jack love her -- this isn't clear, other than she accepts him. Everything is predictable, way too many similes, too wordy. Very, very disappointing."
4,teenagers and whiches,"Jodie, this time delves into to occult practice of wican and shows what can happen when teenagers get in over there heads. Gets you thinking, especially when the main character is truly innocent"
4,Salem Falls,Loved this book.Have read many of her books before and was as happy this one as all the rest
4,One of her best,"I liked it, Jodi seemed to go back to her older writing style that I enjoyed from ""Plain Truth"". Would recommend it."
4,Salem Falls,"The author is very talented and writes her novels extremely well.Her books are filled with suspense and keep the reader captivated and on their toes, for me that is the ideal reading material....The only thing I would have to knock was the very end of the book, I know that isn't a very good sign (and I do hope it won't put you off reading it) but I just thought the end of the book was completely unexpected and I would've appreciated it more, had there been some subtle indications of the ending through the book which would have not lead the ending to be so utterly surprising and almost out of place, even though it was dealing with the topics touched upon throughout the book, it did leave me feeling a little disappointed."
3,Not her best!,"I have read most of Picoult's books and this one started off quite strong only to finish off in a weak manner. There were inconsistencies and things that were not realistic. And every character was not developed as well as they usually are in her books. Not a bad read, but not groundbreaking!"
4,"Good read, but not great","I liked this book. I didn't feel anything in particular about Jack, but I knew he was innocent from the beginning. I wasn't really sure why needed to know his mother's background story, but I guess some pages needed to be filled in. I agree with other reviewers, that some of the courtroom tactics were unbelievable. I understand that Gillian was being abused by her father, but I don't see any relevance to her falsely accusing Jack of rape. That confused me. But, all, in all, I thought it was a good book."
3,"Salem Falls, quick read and good, not great","This is my second Jodi Picoult book. I first read the Plain Truth and I really enjoyed it. Salem Falls is not as good, but I did like it and it was an extremely quick read. I must say that it was predictable and many reviewers find Picoult formulaic in her writing. But since this is only the second novel of hers that I've read I won't say that--yet. She does know how to put together a good story that moves along at a decent pace. Sometimes, that's all I want!"
3,"Big Picoult Fan, Not One of Her Best","I am a big fan of Jodi Piccoult's books - I have read every one except her newest - and I will read that one soon.Salem Falls is not a terrible book, but it certainly isn't one of Picoult's best. I felt that a number of story lines were predictable and I just didn't get wrapped in and invested in these characters.I wanted another ""My Sister's Keeper"" or ""The Pact"", where I couldn't put the book down. This is a good and iteresting read, but could have been better."
2,Not Picoult's Best Work,"I really love reading Picoult books - I love the switching between viewpoints and the exploration of rather dark subjects. The idea behind this book - witches starting a ""witch hunt"" and the terrible nature of rape - was very good. But overall I was left unsatisfied. The twist is obvious from 1,000 miles away and it is disheartening that no one discovers it during the book or even takes the time to put some mild clues together. I am happy for Jack and Addie, but feel too that their ending is unrealistic. Perhaps if Jack had been convicted, and then exonerated when the twist was discovered I would have felt better about reading the book, and enjoyed the ending/resolution to a dark tale."
4,"Jodi Picoult's ""Salem Falls""","I've been enjoying reading Ms. Picoult's books - this is the latest one that I've read. An interesting read, it might make you look at your own opinions of the book's subject, and I'm sure you'll wonder why the characters are behaving in the way they are behaving - would I do that? I like all of this author's books that I've read so far and plan on reading more."
3,It is a Gift,"I like Jodi Picoult books and so does my daughter and mom. I haven't read this one but got it for gifts. I have enjoyed her other books so am guessing I will enjoy this one also. I gave it a three star only because I haven't read it yet, so don't know how it will be."
2,Not her best work,The premise here is flawed. The plot is so unbelieveable. A very well educated mature individual takes a plea to sexual assault when he's innocent. It gets worse from there. Even for fiction that's pretty far out. I'd skip this one.
2,Had to skim this one,"I have to agree with the other reviewers who called this predictable and disappointing. I also saw the ending a mile off. I found the characters flat, and started skimming before the book was half-way through."
1,The End?,"This book was a great read, until the last chapter. Before gettting there, I did not like the doubts thrown in about Jack, after we were lead by the author to believe in him. The ending is horrible, not because of anything horrible that happened, but because it is not clear. You are left with an IDEA that MAYBE you understand. Maybe some readers like this, for me, it diminishes the experience of the book. I don't want to ""make up my own ending"". I can do that by reading half a book. I've asked others what they thought the ending meant but I can't find anyone who has read it. I'm just chalking this one up to a loss of about six hours of my life and keeping the writer and her style in mind as things to avoid in the future."
4,Read it for the Story,"Much like Perfect Match, Picoult has written a real page turner with controversy and plausible characters.This novel centers around Jack who has been convicted of a crime and is trying to start over. Unfortunately he is accused a of a second similar crime in his new surroundings. The dialog is well crafted and does not cause you to read the same line three times to understand. The prose is smooth and the story moves along at a swift pace.Picoult develops her characters so you identify with them and have a vested interest in them. The plot is a little weird including some witch practice by teenagers. But unlike others who have reviewed this book I do not think it is far fetched. If you have been in the high schools today you will know it happens every day.Main guy Jack is the subject of a trial for the allegations. Trial scenes are well crafted but not too in depth. Read this book for the action. It goes fast and is very entertaining."
4,Salem Falls -- I really enjoyed this book,"I have not been impressed with Jodi Picoult's past work, but Salem Falls kept me on the edge of my seat. I found the novel to be suspenseful right up until the very end, when the verdict of the trial was released.Picoult mixed emotions well and really helped her characters display the true meaning of love, trust, and support. She made me feel as if I were suffering all along with Jack and I was so happy with the outcome of the novel, although it was a little predictable."
3,Disappointing,"Although the writing is beautiful and the book a good read, I expected more than the trite and predictable plot twists. There are NO surprises here; the book has the feel of a ""wanna-be"" Oprah book. This author can, and has, done so much better."
4,A Good Read,This book grabbed me from the beginning. Jodi Picoult took a difficult topic and sensitively showed both sides in this novel. She shows how events can be distorted and how circumstantial evidence can ruin a person's reputation. The ending was not much of a surprise which is why I only gave it four stars. Still I think it is one of her best.
3,Not My Favorite Picoult Novel,"I adore Jodi Picoult. I have a very hard time putting her novels down. Her writing is mesmerizing, usually. I didn't find that to be the case in Salem Falls. I could not like nor related to Jack, the main character. He was too remote and distant from the reader. I felt like I was on the outside looking in at him. It was an unpleasant feeling.Also, I was more than a little unhappy with Picoult's depiction of witchcraft and paganism. I am a practicing pagan and I found that her explanations of how magick works and what paganism is very informed. However, her representations of pagans - 4 lying, scheming, teenage girls and 1 typical pagan/hippy hybrid - to be lacking and insulting. You can do much better than that, Ms. Picoult."
3,Not As Good as My Sister's Keeper or Vanishing Acts,"I didn't enjoy this nearly as much as My Sister's Keeper or Vanishing Acts. Maybe it was the subject matter and the blatant rip of The Crucible, but are teenage girls really that eager to incriminate male teachers/coaches? Jack St. Bride has the rottenest luck of anyone on earth to be wrongly accused not once but twice. The sad truth is that innocent people do sometimes get railroaded, and that was well captured in this book. I just found 400 pages to be a bit long. It was well researched--the author did her homework on technical details such as DNA testing and forensic science."
4,Loved it!,"Huge fan of Jodi Picoult, a magnificent author that grabs the reader from the first page. Her depiction of Wicca was accurate and respectful, and as in all of her books, her knack for suspense and characterization was great."
3,Just fair plot with good character development,"While I appreciated the careful and thoughtful character portraits, I thought the plot was somewhat unbelievable. Overall I was disappointed in Salem Falls after truly enjoying most of Picoult's novels."
5,I read this book in 3 days,"Like ""Plain Truth"" I couldn't put this book down. Jodi Picoults writting grabs ahold of you at the beginning of the book and doesn't let go until the last page. The story is very interesting and I love how she tells the story from many different characters. The last line of this book is haunting and beautifully written, it leaves you saying ""...WOW, I can't believe it..."" READ THIS BOOK!!"
4,Salem Falls,"This was my first Jodi Picoult book, and I loved it. I'm not one to try to analyze a book, so I did not see the ending coming. Having worked in a diner in my younger days, I could truly picture the characters interacting. I have since read three more of Jodi's books, but this by far is my favorite."
4,Which Hunt?!?!?,"Though I liked this book, I was disappointed that the book took so long to get going. As you pick up this book, Reader, don't give up hope, it keeps getting better and better...and then it is over and you want more."
3,Grabs my attention,"I personally find this book very interesting and I keep wanting to read more. I can't stand the characters and I think it's a good thing becuase I wait for them all to be shot down in their own ways. I can't compare this to Picoult's other books, but I certainly liked it. I always enjoy a little witchcraft in a book and that's one reason I enjoyed it."
3,"Ok, but very predictable.","I read this novel after reading My Sister's Keeper, which i thought was a better read and had a surprising twist at the end. Salem Falls, however, is very predictable with no surprises what's so ever. I also found inconsistencies in the story that i felt should have been caught by the editor or proofreader or someone. (dates concerning Chloe's death and how many of Addie's rapists still lived in town). Anyways, i knew what was going to happen and why Gillian was so messed long before the end of the book. To the person below who couldn't figure out why Gillian was so angry at her father, reread the last page, it says it all and explains the semon on her thigh. Overall, ok read but nothing real exciting."
1,Preposterous Melodrama,"Maybe it's the audio CD narrator alternating between sickly sweet mooniness, to out-of-place scorn, to stilted cardboard cut-out attempts at male voices, but I can't believe this is the effort of an award-winning writer. She apparently doesn't even know that ""The reason is because"" is improper English. The events in this ""story"" are so ridiculously improbable, she destroys her own credibility. The writing is at best, specious. At worst are lines like ""throw away his freedom like an extra stick of gum"", and sappy offerings such as ""his name rolled around her mouth like a butterscotch candy"" - I won't torture you by quoting descriptions of gratuitous teen (and adult) sex, or the occasional, oddly-placed crudeness. Hyperbole and melodrama reign supreme here."
3,Some Entertainment Value but Chock Full of Unrealistic Behavior/Scenes. Good Beach Read,"Jodi Picoult does a good job of creating characters and making you want to read about them. She did that in Salem Falls with two of her characters, Addie Peabody & Jack St. Bride. Her third main character, Jordan McAfee, an attorney who has been in her other books, comes off as ""not so bright"" in Salem Falls (we have to be reminded that he is a good defense lawyer).The problem with Salem Falls is that there are just too many unrealistic behaviors/scenes in the book - from terrible courtroom scenes to teenager relationships/remorse to an alcoholic father miraculously being able to function.If you suspend belief in reality, this book is a good beach/vacation read."
5,Sucks you in to the story until you HAVE to know what really happened!,"Jodi is a twisted, facinating writer that delivers every time and knows how to grab a reader. They are dark at times, but in this world very believable. This ended bitter sweet such as all of her books do!"
3,"Readable, but fell flat for me.","Well, ""Salem Falls"" definitely isn't one of Jodi Picoult's best. I read this just after I read The ""Tenth Circle"" and maybe I didn't enjoy it because the storylines of the two novels are similar in that they concern a teenager making false rape accusations. Of the two, ""Tenth Circle"" is by far the better read. To me, ""Salem Falls"" was far-fetched, pushed the clumsy, witch-hunt theme to within an inch of its life, and was peopled by characters that it was difficult to relate to, apart from Jack, the main character. Jordan Macafee, the lawyer from ""The Pact"", returns in ""Salem Falls"" and defends Jack on the rape charges. I found Ms Picoult's writing style in this one quite stilted and whilst it was very readable, as her novel's always are, it is not one I particularly recommend."
4,Jodi strikes again!,"This was one of my favorite books of the summer. :) It was mildly predictable, but still a great read."
1,This 67 minute version is cut. The 73 minute version was cut,"This version is 67 minutes long. The previous version on VHS and on some other DVD is 73 minutes.Note - Even the 73 minute version is cut.There is a very important scene involving the taking of tires. Part of the scene showing important information to the story is cut.I fortunately caught the uncut film on PBS a number of years ago, thus was able to notice this.By the way, why does Amazon include a 'NO' in 'was this review helpful to you?'. People are only human and don't like opinions that differ from themselves, thus the 'NO' makes it too easy express such displeasure.Are they trying to discourage negative reviews, hence not purchase the CD. Such reviews only help a person in not being dissatisfied a product that received positive reviews"
1,poor dvd,"This DVD was so boring, I couldn't get my girls interested in watching it. I thought it looked educational, but it is very strange. Do not waste your money--"
3,Not a story video.,"I thought that this video would be cartoon stories, illustrations of the stories, with the words at the bottom. More of a book on tv screen. Some pictures but the screen is mainly filled with the paragraph of a given page. Will be more useful when son is older but not really helpful for a toddler. thought he would have Bible stories on tv with phonics emphazied and the letters and words to go along with what he was hearing. Different format and really for older children as not enough illustrations/graphics for young children. Would be nice to add variety to an older child's reading options. Very book like not video format."
1,Nice Try,"I bought this for my husband who collects Christmas books. He quickly put it aside. When I asked why, he said he had just read something that he was sure was wonderfully written with excellent English, but he didn't have a clue what it said!"
3,Good Starter Lens,"I've owned a copy of the Tamron 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 lens for many years. It started usage on an old Rebel G 35mm film camera, and then found a home on a Digital Rebel XT. This lens is a low budget lens, but does a fairly good job at producing decent images. Works as a fairly wide zoom on a film camera, and a slightly wide zoom on the digital camera. Very light in weight due to the amount of plastic used in making it. Easy to change, and easy using filters with. If you are just starting out, this lens might be a good option. Colors and sharpness aren't great, but are also not horrible. This lens has managed to work like new, even though it has been banged around often. The lens hood is a must! I've taken over 3000 shots with this lens, so I guess it is safe to say that I've got my money's worth!"
3,Tamron Autofocus 28-80mm,"Fair is fair, and $50 bucks for a lens gets you a $50 lens. Great starter for someone getting into SLRs. Won't give you the greatest pictures ever, but for shooting snapshots of the kids on vacation, you really can't beat this."
4,it's works,"very nice, and the important its that works easy to use and useful the quality very good i use it more that others."
2,Sub-par and dissapointing Tamron 28-80mm - PASS!,"Off the bat: I did not purchase this lens via Amazon.com. However, I offer this as general advise on the product alone. The lens strictly stating, is an unbelievably shocking underperformer. Shooting from aperature priority (in all ranges) to shutter priority, the lens is simply poor quality. It never reaches 'reasonable' looking sharp photos and ultimately fails in every catagory, from color to chromatic abberation. Though you could consider this a tough good 'first' lens to learn with - except the fact that it may allude the first time DSLR'r to think something is wrong with their camera, when it's really the extremely poor optics of this Tamron lens. I despise the Canon 18-55mm as well but the verdict of sharpness and linear quality is unmistakable...any alternative to this focal range is superior in all shots. I offer you to PASS on this lens entirely.B.O.L.!"
1,"frustrated, problems focusing.","used to use my canon 18-55 to shoot indoors & for wide angle shots but I needed to replace it quite quickly just before christmas- I didn't want to spend too much for a lens just to take some pics over christmas holiday so I got this- I was expecting that it wouldn't be the same as my canon lens but gosh, I've only been frustrated by this lens- even when lighting is light enough to get it to focus, the focus is NOT good- but that's only when it will focus because I have been having a heck-uva-time trying to get it to focus on my kids unless their whole face is aiming directly at me AND there is enough light on the facial features for the lens to find something to focus on- low light focusing, forget it. focusing with flash- forget it also. can't wait to buy another canon 18-55- argh!"
3,AMCMANUS,"Lense is slow to auto focus so I use it in Manual focus mode, but I have been satisfied with the pictures taken with it."
3,Had to change my review,"I started out liking this lens, but decided it was just too soft. Hand-holding just didn't produce sharp images like my 50mm 1.8. I am going to get the Tamron 28 - 75 - it has gotten great reviews."
4,Decent lens at a great price.,"I bought this lens when the kit lens that came with my XTi got broken. I was hoping this lens would be a replacement for the similar Canon one. However, once I started using the Tamron I quickly realized that it is noticeably slower in focusing than the Canon. It also seems I have to be zoomed out farther or physically farther from the subject to get a good focus - and sometimes it just searches and never obtains focus. While the Canon lens was not perfect, I think it was a little better than this one. One great thing about Tamron lenses is that most of them come with a hood, which is great when bonus is keeping out stray light. This lens is adequate for many shooting situations and makes a great ""walk-around"" lens for most folks, but it's not without it's drawbacks."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this lens after noticing in the item's picture that it has an aperture ring, which I need for an experiment. Unfortunately, the lens I got doesn't have an aperture ring maybe because they're selling a new version of it!The lens itself looks good for its price & I really like its build, also it came with a lens hood. I didn't test its quality that much, but the images looks fine when taken under appropriate lighting. The most annoying thing about it is its extremely loud autofucus."
2,lens,I received the lens in record time and greatly appreciated that. But the lens only show a very small circle when trying to look through the view finder and take a picture....
5,Fabulous!,"The Hitchhikiers Trilogy is wonderful - entertaining, fun and thought provoking. I suggest you read all 3 books in order, starting with the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. You will love these books."
2,Really not that exciting,"I was disappointed with this book, and really don't understand all the hype over it. Out of the first four books of the ""trilogy in five parts"" (I haven't read the last one yet), this one is by far the least engaging. As short as it is, it took me three days to read it because I found it difficult to absorb. There is a mere skeleton of a plot line, which might have taken all of five pages to tell if not for all of the meandering and weaving around the story line. Much of what happens throughout the story has little to do with what the characters set out to accomplish. I know that this is characteristic of the Hitchhiker series, but at least in the other books, the meandering and going off on tangents leads to a funny occurrence, or is at least humorous in itself. I didn't get anything like that out of this book. While there are a few funny lines in it, it hardly stands out in my mind as a good read."
2,A step in the wrong direction,"Life the Universe and Everything, book 3 in the hitchhikers triogy (which actually has FIVE books)was quite different then the first two. While the first books had lighthearted yet well developed plots, the plot in LUE (Life the Universe and Everything)was darker less well developed, and very unorigonal (I mean come on, saving the universe is so passe). I was also very dissapointed with the humor. While it had it's monents, LUE had less humorous portions and most of the humor seemed very out of context and had nothing to do with the plot. The ending was also very anti-climactic, not having a cliffhanger like the previous boooks. Overall it is a dissapointment compared to the rest of the series but is neccessary to read to get the whole plot of the series. I recommend it to only those who are going to read the rest of the series."
2,Ho hum...,"""Life, the Universe, and Everything"" took me months on end to get through. Every time I opened the book I'd think ""Ha, ha! What a funny and crazy man that Adams is. Why don't I read this more?"", but after a few pages I'd grow weary. This book is genuinely funny, but I think instead of being a five-book trilogy, the Hitchhiker's franchise should have stopped at one. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was one of my favorite books for a time, and still holds a special place in my literary tastes. It's hilarious, and Douglas Adams has undoubtedly the sharpest wit this side of Oscar Wilde! Unfortunately, his abilities in the field of plot propulsion are weak at best. I read through this series, loving the first, liking the second, and by the time I got to this one, I just felt like asking what's the POINT? All this book was was another opportunity for the author to demonstrate his wit, which is, i reiterate, amazing. However, it's not enough to keep me reading, ..."
2,What happened? The first two where so good.,"After two triumphantly funny book, Adams goes insane and writes this terribly dull and UNFUNNY book. I'm not sure if it even deserves 2 stars. The gags fall flat, and the book is every bit as silly as the first two, but they were also funny. Don't bother with this one."
3,A small disappointment,"When I finished this book, I hardly understood what had happened. All I know about it was that it involved the evil robot inhabitants of the planet Krikkit getting sick of looking at the sky, so they decide to destroy it. And naturally, Arthur, Marvin, Ford, Trillian, and Zaphod are the only people who can stop them. However, I found myself laughing quite a bit. Since all the previous books in the series were completely random, I didn't expect this one to be any different. Of course, I was right, but perhaps this one was a bit too Random."
3,Not as inspired...,"Not nearly on the same level as the first two books. The plot seemed to be thrown together, the humour forced, and the characters flat. Marvin would really be depressed reading this one. Still, it had it's moments and is worth a read just to complete the series, if for no other reason."
3,"Great book, but not as great as the first two in the series.","I am a new fan of the Hitchhiker series, and I'm about halfway through the 4th book in the ""trilogy"". Adams uses the same techniques and humor that made the other books in the series so great, and I would say overall this is a very good book. However, I found this book to be my least favorite in the series - there doesn't seem to be as much action and humor in ""Life, the Universe, and Everything"" as there was in the first two books in the series. The story line was good, but not as compelling as the other story lines. Don't get me wrong, the book is very good and I would recommend it to anyone, but it seems to have suffered from the ""middle child syndrome"". I'll give the book 3 stars out of 5, although compared to most sequels, the book is still very, very good."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Throw yourself at the ground and miss. If you can't, don't whine about it.Unfortunately the third Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy book is nowhere near as entertaining as the first two installments. The tone of it changes considerably to somewhat this side of maudlin, apart from the odd entertaining piece like the flying, and insulting the galaxy in order, or a bit of Clockwork Orange inspired cricket."
5,A hylarious satire for the open-minded reader.,"With the exception of ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" this is, in my opinion, Adams' most talented work. The story is amazing, but definitely not for skeptical readers. To fully appreciate his books you should not be asking questions such as ""What does an italian restaurant have to do with mathematics?"" In short: a great book for those who do not think long and hard about every event in the tale."
3,Not as funny as the first two,"This installment is not as funny as the first two... I didn't really laugh at all. A nice bridge to ""Thanks for all the fish"" (which I think is better), but if you only want to laugh, stop at the first two books. It's not particularily funny, or touching, but it of course has the great Adams touch."
2,Jason's review,"I loved the first book, liked the second, and wonder about this one. What happened to the story about Zaphod conspiring to become President of the Galaxy to steal the Heart of Gold and find the six people who rule the universe?!?This book shares the same characters as the first two, but the plot comes out of nowhere. After I finished the book, I still don't completely understand what happened!"
2,A War of 2 Worlds,"The Kricket Planet have been locked up for years trying to get the 3 pillars and the Golden Bail so they can have the key. Once they get out they plan to destroy everything that is not Kricket. Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect set out to relieve the Universe of this disaster and along the way they run into some former past and a dangourous enemy. I would not reccomend this book. The book was slow and hard to follow, though it got better as I read on. I just wish that it would explain more of what happened and that the story would be little more adventurous."
1,A War of 2 Worlds,"The Kricket Planet have been locked up for years trying to get the three pillars and the Golden Bail so they can have the key. Once they get out they plan to destroy everything that is not Kricket. Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect set out to relieve the Universe of this disaster. Along the way they run into some former past and a dangourous enemy. I personnaly would not reccomend this book. The book was slow and hard to follow, though as I read through it, it got better. I just wish that it would explain more of what happened and that the story would be a little bit more adventurous."
2,LifeUniverseEverything: The worst of the guide.,"Of all of the hitchhiking books, I thought that Life, the Universe, and Everything was the worst of them. I can say that it was fairly entertaining, but it was definitely not the best book in the world. I enjoyed Douglas Adams's other books much more than I did this one. This book lacked plot, theme, and revolved around random comments and jokes (that were not very funny). In the other books before it the jokes were much more funny, and fit into the story line better. I am somewhat disappointed in this third book in the marvelous series: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."
5,At last we have a plot...,"It is some time after the second in this great sci-fi/comedy series. Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect are marooned on Earth during the caveman times. It seems they will die in this time period, but this suits them. But suddenly there appears a travelling couch that whisks them away to save the Universe from an evil race of aliens bent on universal destruction. While the first two books are excellent comedy gems, they consist of no real plot. This book does, and also maintains the deadpan humor and absurd realities. It's barrells of fun and a great, quick read. When the book needs to be suspensful, it is. When it needs to be funny, it's hilarious. This is Douglas Adams' very best work and this book is the best in the series."
2,Kindle edition not ready for prime time,"So far I have read the first 4 books, and they have many many problems with words missing, wrong, bad formatting, etc. It looks like they scanned the documents in with some character recognition software and then didn't proofread it (or even run a spell-check). I would like to know if I can get a free update if/when the publisher releases a corrected copy? First-time readers will be very disappointed. I know the books well enough that I (almost) always knew what the words were supposed to be, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of just 1."
1,This book was disapointing!,I thought this one fell seriously short of the othes. Very sad considering the other books that Douglas has written
2,A confusing mind boggling story,"Life, The Universe And Everything is just an ok book. It just didn't grab my attention and hold it. Anyways the book is basically about 5 individuals that go out to save the universe from killer white robots that plan to destroy it. the 5 individuals are Zaphod Beeblebrox a two headed alien, Trillian a space cadet, Arthur Dent a time traveler, Ford Perfect his friend, and Slartibartfast the vice president of the Campaign for real time. The thing i don't like about this book is it jumps around a lot and you sometimes can't tell if they traveled in time unless you read the reread the same lines to get an understanding."
3,"More overhyped, absurd, shtick thats not all that funny.","I wish I could have enjoyed the ""Hitchhiker"" books more than I did. There was definitly some funny moments in the three books, but overall I found the humor to be to absurd and abstract to be taken as funny.If you like ""Monty Python"" material then this book and the first two may be for you. If your like me and you only find ""Monty Python"" to be moderatly funny, then these books may be something to skip.In summary: I found this third book of the ""Hitchhiker"" adventures to be like the first two installments - sometimes funny and interesting, but mostly dull and abstract shtick that simply isn't my style.These books aren't bad, they just aren't all that good either. The second book in the series - ""Resturaunt"" - was the best."
1,HORRIBLE,"This book was terrible, absolutly terrible, the humor was bad, the story very boring. The first book was good but it goes down hill fast after that."
3,Silly but there's always a message,"I'm a latecomer to the ""Hitchhiker's Trilogy"", and just finished the series. ""Life, the Universe, and Everything"" is a bit less funny only because the humour and style is the same as the previous books. And seems to be less ""meat"" in this one. Still, in with all the silliness there are comments about war and xenophobia, as well as the reasons for space travel. Considering how many lives and how much money are sacrificed or spent by the human race on these issues, a topical but funny book about them is welcome relief: laughing a bit instead of crying is allowed.I have no idea why they changed the cover. The original cover with an eyeless green monster sticking out its tongue made much more sense."
3,Nothing new here,"Adams continues to produce laughs here, but this volume begins to repackage material from the first two books. You have the same type of jokes, situations, randomness and plot twists here from the previous books. While those things were hilarious the first time around, they lose some of their impact on the second and third helpings. Fans of the series will enjoy this volume, but I found it to be less satisying than the first two novels in the series. While I've enjoyed the journey so far, this book does not motivate me sufficiently to read the rest of the series. I can only recommend this book if you loved the first two."
5,Awesome!,"The third book in the trilogy is still full of Adams's crazy, hilarious ideas. It answers questions asked in the previous books, such as ""What is the meaning of life?"" Ford, Arthur, Zaphod, and the others are are some of the best characters created."
3,Wrong Color,"The color of these gloves is more like mustard, not buckskin. Bought as gifts so not sure how they feel on or how warm they are. Believe they are true to size. Seemed to be well constructed. Good Value, just didn't like the color."
4,Nice but not HEAVY enough,"The necklace is very well put together and perfect length 22"". I was expecting a thicker/heavy chain unfortunately, it was not...yet still very nice. I think I'll go with a 4mm or 5mm heavier (male) necklace next time."
3,.,The turtle charm arrived a day later than promised which was a problem and was smaller than expected.Price not bad.
4,"It's really cute, but...","I was expecting some brighter sapphire stones, and its shorter than an inch...Overall, it's still a nice piece of jewelry, i just wish it was a little bigger"
3,fast shipping,was smaller then I expected and I thought it had a chain.Over all it looked nice I guess.I gave it to my youngest and She had a chain that She put it on
4,A cute gift for turtle lovers.,"My wife became fascinated with the product, is a little smaller than it appears in the picture but is happy to have him.Mi mujer quedo fascinada con el producto, es un poco mas chico de lo que parece en la foto pero esta feliz de tenerlo."
5,So cute!,I thought this charm was really cute. I kept it for myself for my charm bracelet although I had intended to give it as a gift. Fast service. Great price on sale. Well made.
2,"Documentary, not film",Lots of gorgeous photos of the guys. This is a documentary of a three-some relationship. It is not a film.
3,"Three stars for ""Three""",This DVD needs to be listed as a documentary and nothing more. And a silly one at that. It's gets three stars cause it's not bad to look at...but that's it.
2,Save Your Money - Buy the Book,"I never thought I'd say this about a movie starring three gorgeous men, but the book far surpasses the movie in this instance. This is a tedious profile full of obviously staged and ridiculously pointless ""candid"" moments and interviews, wherein the boys act like the subjects of some gossipy telespecial. Worse yet, it's artlessly videotaped, with clever (and juvenile) editing tricks filling far too much time. (Must we be subjected to a female member of the crew going backwards and forwards over and over in time to the soundtrack for far too long?) This could have been edited down to maybe 5-10 minutes, a quick segment on an entertainment TV show. As it is, it takes away when it should be adding to the story of this interesting trio. A huge disappointment, even when I wasn't expecting that much to begin with..."
2,bleh...,"the guys are cute. but the whole time there was this annoying music playing in the background. it practically drove me crazy as it sounded trite, cheesy and just plain DUMB. I wanted to see WAYY more nudity. No scenes of intimacy or even tenderness that I can remember. It's not remotely close to softcore...softcore anything really. the whole thing was a badly done interview of the guys. kris didn't look half as hot as I thought he'd look plus he was kinda fem, which I didn't expect him to be. the other two guys were hot. that's pretty much it. 2 stars just cus the boys are pretty to look at. now what am I gonna do with this dvd? ebay it I suppose."
4,HOT THREESOME ---HERE THREE IS DEFINITELY NOT A CROWD!,"Having met Howard Roffman (the photographer)and his famous threesome models at their gallery opening in New York City when his book, THREE (rated 5 stars) came out; I was impressed by their awesome presence. Each of the models came across as beautiful, spiritually and physically. I was fortunate to have the magnificent photography book signed by the artist as well as own one of their works purchased at the gallery. Recalling such an event, I had to own the film, THREE. It captures these three hunks before, during, and after the photoshoots...it captures the spirit of teamwork. You won't be disappointed with this photo/docu/film...especially with these three handsome nude men embracing each other with true comraderie! Kudos to well respected photographer, Howard Roffman, for continuing to create beautiful images of the male form whether alone, in duos, and, in this case, threesome."
2,Rather Disapointing,"This documentary, based on the photo-book of the same name by Howard Roffman, explores the relationship of three gay men in love with each other and living together. While the men are incredibly handsome and seem to truly care about each other, there is not much depth to any of them. Having multiple-shots of the same scene quickly becomes annoying. Even the nudity is too brief to arouse much interest. One comes away from this dvd without learning anything profound or even useful about a three-way relationship. The photo-book is much better in all areas."
3,Took 2 years but I broke it.,"Picked one of these up when I got my first powerboat 2 years ago. Only used it to pull a tuber. It worked great for 2 years in the salt. I never loved the steel cable, it sinks and could potentially foul the prop. The red buoy floats and helped to prevent that... until today. I'm not sure if the bouy took on water and sank, or if it was my first time in fresh water and the buoyancy changed. But it got in my prop trapped (squeezed in between the prop and lower unit and stalled the motor and ripped the plastic coating exposing the cable which looked fine.We kept running on it like this and it got caught again and broke. Prop is fine but the steel cable is done.Next time I'm getting a floating line version."
3,Compression hose,Bought this for my husband who is confined to a wheelchair. They seem to have helped some with the swelling in his calves. Found some elsewhere for less money and probably would not purchase these again.
4,Little slow on delivery,as described.. If you are looking for Therapeutic Support socks-these are the way to go. Got tangled up in the Christmas rush-but did make it.
2,Toe tearing,"After wearing not more than 10 times the toe is tearing. I am very disappointed because I have had other brands last years for me. The company Med Life strung me along and did not call me back, then said I had to send them back for evaluation to see if I was responsible for the tear. I would have to pay shipping."
5,great product!,I spend 12 hours a day on my feet at work. Started getting varicose veins and pain in my legs. these worked wonders! My legs feel so much better. No pain or swelling by the end of the day. use the chart for size measurements - It was pretty accurate. The feet are nice and roomy. I will bet getting another pair.
2,"Looks good, doesn't play good.","When I first opened up the package, it looked kinda cheap and flimsy and I was a little bit disappointed at first sight. Then I put it on my Wiimote and It looked pretty good on it, so the next day i tried to play a game with my new Wiimote cover on. Horrible. The plastic around the 1 and 2 buttons goes up as high as the buttons which makes it really hard to press down, same thing with the A, Home, - and + and also power buttons, the only button that is truly accessible and easy to press is the D-Pad. The Nunchuk cover works great. Looks good over all but i would not recommend it to anyone that would like to play a game with relative ease."
3,Easy to rip,"WE got the item it was as described, only complaint is that it is a little thin and ripped during the intital application to the remote... best thought for this product is put it on and LEAVE it on! It is not durable enough to take on and off multiple times!"
2,will not buy again,do not buy these! they do not fit the WII remote good. stick with the type of case that come with the wii remote that comes with the console. colorful and useless!
1,Not worth buying!,Very cheap product. Mine ripped the same day I got it. They tear at the seams very easy.Eforcity Premium 2 Tone Virgin Silicone Skin Case for Nintendo Wii Remote Control & Nunchuk ' Green / Solid Green (Purchased on 01/04/2009)by Eforcity
4,Granddaughter's request for Christmas ....,"...so haven't listened much, but would give it 5 stars if I had... surely. My favorite CD from Ungars is still Song of Home...."
2,Waltzing with you,Disappointing. Only a couple songs worth listening too. Saved those and donted to Good WIll
5,All I Do...is hum this tune...,"I first heard this song 'All I Do' on my jazz music channel on TV. I couldn't stop humming this tune. Then I discovered all the treats he has put together on this CD. My favorites are of course, All I Do, I Want You, and Anytime. The rest are great too and I'll probably have a new favorite list including those later. It's ashame that this CD has been out for 2 yrs and I'm just now discovering it. But like they say, 'good things (songs) comes to those who wait...'"
5,Excellent,"A wonderful CD that everyone should own, appropriate for alloccasions, absolutely fabulous....a must have :)"
5,A Must Have,"This has to be one of the nicest Contemporary Smooth Jazz CD's ever created. The ENTIRE CD is nice. His remake of Anytime and Ascension are my personal favorites. If you don't like it, let me know and I'll buy yours!!!"
1,wm,"Whiteside's K41 was purchased to rout a table for a router plate --- just what the bit is advertised to do. The plate is a 1/4 inch aluminum plate (8 1/4 by 11 3/4) so that's what the bit depth was set at. The bit did make it around the template, barely. Just as it finished the final turn the 1/4 inch shank broke in half. An examination showed the collar set screw was missing and the collar loose, letting the bearing wobble all over the place. The bearing was damaged and hard to turn, but with the shank broken it doesn't matter. I'm sending the broken bit back to Whiteside to see if their warranty works. Whiteside has replaced the bit with no questions asked. I haven't used the new one yet, but my hope is that is holds up."
4,Hmmm That Reminds Me Of .W.A.,"Worms World Party is just like worms armageddon, just a couple of more weapons in my opinion!But saying that it is a gr8 game all the same.Excellent 4 having a laugh with yer m8's.If u want 2 save yer money then buy Worms Armageddon,But if you want extra level and a coupl more weapons then get Worms World Party.Go on Buy it!!!!!!"
3,I don't got worms.,"I am a BIG fan of Worms II. So, I bought Worms: World Party to play with friends on our LAN, but I could not get the game to work. Figuring the CD was defective I bought a second CD, and encured the same errors.I tried the game on two different platforms, Windows ME and Windows 98, but with no positive results.When I tried to troubleshoot, and the website was terribly slow and not very helpful, their bulletin board wouldn't post the messages I'd try to write. And they didn't have an 800 number at customer support. Overall I had a very bad experiance with the game. I'm sure the game is fantastic, if you get the chance to play it.So, if you get it to work great, but if you have tech problems, it's probably just best to return the CD before your time runs out.-- Joseph Hawkins (-2 stars for bad customer support)*PS the error occurred when the game created ~D*.tmp"
1,"I'd laugh, but it's not worth the effort.",You should note the reviews on this site that praise this despicable waste of money are all from the US. It hasn't actually been released in the US.That should be your clue.(HINT : Don't waste your money.)
2,Disappointing,"If you already own previous versions of the Worms series then you will be very disappointed with this latest reincarnation.Apart from the many bug fixes there is nothing extra to justify the price. Contrary to popular belief, there are no new weapons and the WormPot mode is very similar to the cheat options from Worms Armageddon. The new front-end graphics are tailored for a younger audience with the exact same layout as Worms Armageddon too. Worms World Party also lacks league play and a world ranking system that made Worms Armageddon so popular. There is no mission editor as of yet, Team17 have made this as an extra download as they did with The Fiddler for Worms Armageddon.Worms World party is a good game if you do not have Worms 2 or Worms Armageddon only because of the fact that Worms is a fantastic game in it's own right. Give this game a miss if you expect new features from a sequel."
1,What's the difference?!,"Why did it take them a year after the original release date to release it if it is so much similar to Worms Armaggedon. All those new features they promised to add barely make a difference. If you already own WA or W2, it's not worth it to buy WWP."
1,"Broken, Buggy, Bad Tech Support","Here's my experience with Worms World Party: After installing the game, it won't run at all. I just get an Illegal Operation error. The vendor's web site says to uninstall/reinstall, and apply a patch. So I go to uninstall... I get an error there too. It won't uninstall!! So I delete it completely. I reinstall it. I apply the patch. Still doesn't work. Next step: Fill out the ""Return Item"" form on the Amazon web site. Very disappointing."
4,"A harmless, entertaining strategy game","Worms World Party is a very entertaining strategy game for nearly any audience. Both young players and mature ones will find some fun in this title. Gameplay is simple and yet provides for many variations in strategy. Games with other players can really be a great time as each team's worms try to blow up one another. The Wormpot mode selection provides for a lot of interesting scenarios as well. There is a random map generator as well as a terrain editor so you will never play the same map twice. Weapons are varied, interesting, and well-designed. This is a very good game but not an excellent one. You should still find a lot of fun in it, though, so I would recommend to you as a worthwhile purchase."
1,Pure dissapointment,"I got my hands on a copy of WWP today and was sorely dissapointed. I'm a huge fan of Armageddon, and was way excited for this release. But nothing fantastic has been added. Some multiplayer options were changed, different training is available, and the interface was made annoying. That's it. Everything else is the same. Save your money, unless you want to run Win2k...In my opinion, there's no other reason to try WWP."
4,"must d/l patch, afterward it is GREAT!!","In reference to the review below that talks about the technical issues, I had the same problem. All I did was email the tech support team about it and they pointed me to a patch for the game that I needed to download. VOILA! It worked like a charm after that.This game is amazingly simple and amazingly complex all at the same time. I became addicted before I ever played it just by watching one of my friends play it for several hours one weekend. It has some great strategy, funny/cute sounds and voices, lots of customizable features (including custom voices), and to top it all off you get to blow things up!! Great game."
5,Eat the Lotus! R.E.M.'s UP is great!,"Lotus of course is my favorite, but I like ""At my most beautiful"" and ""Why not smile?"" a lot too. It's not your typical R.E.M. music but it's something a little different and just as good. If you don't trust religion or the doctor, UP is here to help you trust yourself."
5,Not REM.......but REM,"What else can I say, the new REM album realy is a testiment to the flexible, diverse nature of REM's lirics and music. Even though 'Daysleeper' was never and never will be a chart topper, it still draws you in and you want to listen to it over and over again. From mellow and deep songs like 'Daysleeper' and 'Why not Smile' to the very loud and very complex song 'Lotus'. I bought the album on the morning it came out and I haven't stopped listening since. It truely is a beautiful and meaningful piece of music history."
5,"R.E.M. experiences their crowning moment with ""UP"".","""UP"" is, quite simply, one of the most emotional, powerful, best-written pieces of work ever created. R.E.M., particularly lyricist Michael Stipe, through this album showcase their great talent and formidable writing abilities. ""Daysleeper"" is an emotional ode to the everyman, a passionate yet solemn tribute to the nine-to-five workers of the world. ""Lotus"", the one solid rocker, pleases with its harsh vocals and droning keyboard as mystifies with complex lyrics and intelligent phrasing. ""At My Most Beautiful"" is unquestionably an out-and-out love song, portraying Stipe at his most passionate. ""Hope"", with its evocative phrasing and intriguing musical complexity, is one of the best examples of a well-written song on the album. These are but a few examples to lay claim to fact that R.E.M.'s ""UP"" is one of the golden moments in this band's creative prime."
2,OK,"I thought I was buying the regular brush size, it seemed that way in the description, instead I got te travel size (???)"
1,Terrible Transfer,"This William S. Hart film has been added to the National Film Registry as one of our treasured films, but this DVD release is NOT the way to see it. The cover art of the disc is great but the film transfer is about as bad as they get. There must be a better transfer in one of the Treasures of . . . sets."
3,"Not my favorite, but not bad at all.","This is not a bad album at all, but I quite prefer the originals to the remixes in just about every case."
4,Great Gel Seat,Super comfortable. Excellent buy. My only drawback is that there needs to be a better way of strapping the seat that is not so obvious.
4,A Great Value,"A well-done album without the silly psuedo-pub backgound noise. Thirty well and semi-well known Irish tunes sung by professional musicians. Better editing might have eliminated the 'rush-to-pack- it-in' feeling. All in all, an excellent value."
1,WARNING!,"This movie was absolutely terrible! The entire time they are building you up with things that they expect to make you feel emotion, and then it ends with him waking up and the whole thing being a dream and him not learning any lesson at all! Probably one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time, this is a definite movie NOT to watch! Totally disgusting, boring and emotion-less, Click is a movie to leave on the shelf!"
2,Yawn.,"Everytime an Adam Sandler movie comes along, I somehow get talked into watching it and, yes, everytime, I come away dissappointed. This one was no exception. Maybe I'm just too old to ""get"" this kind of humor but for me, it just wasn't funny. This one has a ""Cat's in the Cradle"" theme which is okay in and of itself. The whole message of slow down and enjoy life while it lasts, and keep your priorities is order, is sage advice for us all, but the movie itself was just a total bore. Christopher Walken is his usual superb self, but has really only a bit part here. This is two hours of my life I wish I had back."
1,A waste of time and money,"I truly don't like giving any product a negative review, especially a film that so many people put so much into, but what are we supposed to do, simply sit their and spend our own hard earned money on whatever drivel any actor or comedian or director or film company is able to finance and get made and distributed? The only mechanism we have to defend ourselves is the plethora of critics and which one do you believe? I didn't hear one negative thing about this movie, the opposite was true, but yet after I'd bought it and watched it just now I couldn't believe I'd been conned into wasting my time and money on this NOT FUNNY remake of ""A Christmas Carol"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" minus Christmas and a watchable movie. Adam Sandler has worked hard to get where he is, but he needs someone to dare to tell him ""Sorry, this isn't very good"" when that is the case. He can do better, way better, and I look forward to the day he does. Don't waste your money."
2,CLICKS,"THE MOVIE WAS NOT THAT GOOD, I WAS SURPRISE THAT IS WASN'T THAT GOOD. THE MOVIE WAS SLOW, AND NOT THAT FUNNY..SEE BETTER...ONLY 2 STARS..SORRY!!!"
2,There are much better films with the same theme.,Family Man - Nicholas Cage; and the best - Grounghog Day.
2,Rent it instead,"This movie started out well enough but turned to multiple crude jokes that got tiresome really quickly. Having dogs humping a stuffed duck and even Sandler once (in shadow)during sex with his wife, definitely does not make this family movie material. As everyone has mentioned, Click does in the end, mirror the message from It's A Wonderful Life -- and for that reason, it is worth a rental. Watch it with your favorite workaholic who is missing out on family.The casting was great. Julie Kavner and Henry Winkler were perfect as the parents and the make up department did a great job of making them appear younger and older. David Hasselhoff and Sandler's crew of regulars were totally funny in their parts but as much as I love Adam Sandler, Click was disappointing. If it had a stronger script, it would have worked."
2,Depressing,"The idea was great, I grant you that, it always was. I've never watched anything so pointless and such a total waste of time. Long, unfunny, and unrelentingly down beat. A bad, bad movie, really bad. Here are some things that are not funny; heart attacks, divorce, manipulative bosses, losing years of your life, the grim reaper. It just goes on and on. It is hard to describe how poor and predictable this movie is. It does not do justice to Sandler's mediocre talent and abuses the greater talents of the actual actors in this movie. Again this is a bad movie with no redeeming features whatsoever. A very big disappointment for anyone looking for a comedy of any sort. It is NOT like Bruce Almighty. Sure, we'd all like a remote control that controls the universe, right? But this one starts screwing up way too early in the movie, turning it much too quickly from ""wish fulfillment"" to slightly depressing nightmare."
3,Click onto another film,"Sandler does give a great performance,and could get a Oscar for ""Click,""but this DVD is boring ."
2,Silly,"The acting is ordinary, no brilliant special effects and nothing deep or original as I am sure I have seen something similar. It is a silly film about a man who has a family and career and puts his career first. He gets this remote control which enables him to manipulate much of his life. Eventually it ruins his life and he finds out that he needs his family first. So we have a Hollywood happy ending that makes it right."
4,Plenty of Wacky Sandler Humor,"This movie had plenty of wacky humor that I've grown to expect from Adam Sandler. That's why I watched it. I didn't expect the movie might have a universal theme I'd find important.But, it did have a strong message about living life in the company of those that love us, not our jobs. It reminded me of a modern day Dicken's Christmas Carol. They had the past, present and future ""controlled"" by the clicker. And there was Christopher Walken playing the (well, I won't ruin that).I liked the futuristic part of the movie the best. I enjoyed seeing the creator's vision of what that future might be like."
2,NOT funny!,"I bought this movie for a laugh but hardly even got a smile out of it. Sandler is good at comedy: he should leave movies ""with a message"" to serious actors. He doesn't have the range to carry this one off."
3,It's Ok,"Adam Sandler plays workaholic dad Michael in a troubled relationship with a wife, two kids and a pooch with a stuffed-duck fetish. Michael goes to a store to purchase a remote control and meets a strange man in the back of the store who gives him a remote which controls more than just his tv. It controls his life.I felt Click had a cute premise, but the humor seemed a bit flat. Some scenes were a bit sophomoric for me (enough with the dog and the duck), others were mildly amusing (when Michael doesn't recognize his own kid at swim practice). Some scenes were just over-the-top (such as when Michael freezes his boss and abuses him while he's frozen). Come on. All bosses are jerks. This guy didn't deserve that kind of treatment.The last 1/3 just seemed a bit too silly. If you come up with a fantastic premise like this one, you don't need to shaft the audience with an 'it was all just a dream' ending.3 stars."
1,Adam Sandler is the worst comedian and actor ever,"Ok, so Sandler is an architect that apparently is the second-in-command at an architecture firm, who designs buildings and reports to the boss on the most important jobs? Why is it that he drives an old Impala, his kids don't have any nice toys, despite the fact that they live in a decent house, next to people that do have money? Then he lives his life like some dude that lives in his mom's basement. Look at his wardrobe in much of the movie. It's like he's wearing his personal lounge clothes in the film! Sandler is just a nasty, slovenly guy who wouldn't be making movies today if he didn't have so much control over his own productions. He's an unfunny bum that exists only to get his sad ex-SNL cast mates work. Sandler is stuck in the early 90's and surrounded by sycophants that won't let him understand what reality is. I feel sorry for the guy. I really can't understand how his films still make money. Click was just awful."
4,A very good movie,"Adam Sandler is a very good actor, not suitable for all audience, but a very good movie except perhaps the end, it's a disney end, not good for this kind of movie."
1,minus 5 stars,"This is possibly the worste most inappropriate,crass,embarrassing UN-funny movie I have ever seen,the acting was poor and the story line was weak. I have no idea how it ended because I never finished it but even a sappy heartfelt 5 star ending wouldn't have been enough to redeem this one for me. My first clue should have been when I realized David Hasselhoff was in it,I should have ran and not looked back at that point. It is TOTALLY not appropriate for the pg-13 audience. If I could have given a minus 5 stars I would have, please don't waist your precious brain cells on this worthless movie."
5,Daddy? What's Adam Sandler doing with our T.V.?,"What he's doing is putting himself in an inspiring (well I'm not sure that I myself would get a remote that could turn my whole life upside-down in an instant and possibly screw it up in the process) and funny film that shows what could happen if your life really goes completely wrong and you're just wishing for a way to change it. It's called Click, simple enough. Sandler at his best since his role as Sunny in Big Daddy, along with a few other stars such as Henry Winkler and David Hasselhoff, turns this movie into a sure-fire hit at the box office, and a movie that the whole family should enjoy."
2,Why Did They Ruin This One?,"This SHOULD have been a good movie. This COULD have been a good movie. The movie had everything that a good movie should have.The acting is good, the story is good, the camerawork is good, the editing is good, and everthing is done just right for a movie that's fun for the whole family.Then they threw bathroom humor into every other scene (for no apparent reason). I hope you like to watch shadows have sex, because that's there too. (Why? I don't know.) Oh, and barnyard porn. With stuffed animals.All I can say is I'm glad I watched this movie before letting my kids near it. It's going back to Blockbuster in the morning."
3,"Funny, But Dramatic As Well.","You see the trailer for Click on the tube, and you think comedy all the way. Well, you get that at first. Before he gets the remote, there are lots of laughs, and even more when Chris Walken gives it to him free of charge. This mixed bag ends up being sad, and almost makes you want to cry.I don't want to go in too much detail to ruin the movie for everyone, but it revolves around lost love and death. It is so sad to see what happens to the main characters as Adam Sandler's life gets stuck in fast forward, which shows him a glimpse of the future. The futuristic design of things was surprisingly very convincing.I recommend this movie as a dramedy. It is funny at first, but sad near the end."
3,Could have been better,"Click started out with a lot of promise, and it had some funny parts, but unfortunately, the movie sputtered out in quite a few parts with cheap and low-brow jokes. The movie had a lot of potential especially given the plot device, a remote-control that affects reality. There were some very good and funny parts, but overall, I cannot give this movie more than 3 stars."
4,"Somber, But Funny Adam Sandler Flick","This movie will make you laugh, and it will also make you cry. This is definately one of Adam's best performances, plus I never expect to cry at an Adam Sandler movie lolI recommend this movie to everyone"
1,Utterly Dumb,"When I seen Click, I was very disappointed! Yes, the end was sad and all, but the entire movie was a waste of time. Basically all the movie was about was dogs humping a stuffed duck! How is that such a great movie? I was expecting a better movie than the one i got. So save your money and don't get it. It's a waste of time and money."
1,"""CLICK"" your remote to turn this movie off!","""Click"" is a hodgepodge of ideas stolen from ""It's a Wonderful Life"", ""A Christmas Carol"", ""Wizard of Oz"" and ""Back to the Future"". It starts off as a fairly pleasant typical Adam Sandler (looking old and drained these days) comedy and ending up as a melodramatic, tragic and sentimental soap opera. The movie reminded me of ""For the Boys"" with Bette Midler, not in subject matter, but in its similarity in tone. That movie by started out as a musical comedy and ending up as a tragic melodrama. The contrast in both movies is just too jarring, leaving the viewer cold.Personally, I think Adam Sandler is getting too old for this sort of nonsense. He has not really matured as an actor in the same manner as, say, Robin Williams, and would be wise to take some acting lessons or stick to producing."
3,It's not so bad...,"Of course Click wasn't worth the $7.00 ticket price but POTC 2 was sold out. I think it would be worth the $4.00 rental price however, or better yet just wait til it's on HBO next year.It was actally better than the previews made it out to be but not by a lot. That doesn't usually happen. It's basically just your average Adam Sandler movie, just what you'd expect from one. But I found Kate Beckinsale to be a bit annoying, she was really stressing that American accent and didn't do a very good job with it. Well, the first half wan't great but then it started to get better. It only provides a few laughs and warning: you may cry. There is a very sad part that lasts for a while. I could see the end coming though, as, I'm sure, could many other movie-goers. Well, as with every Adam Sandler movie, you know what you're getting into and you get what you pay for."
2,Not Good,"This was a great concept, however the movie just didn't reach the potential of the story. I would like to see better screen writers re-do this picture. This time with a little bit more imagination"
2,Change the Channel,"This is a very disappointing movie. If Adam Sandler opens a flix for you, then get it. You'll possibly enjoy seeing him roll out his rag tag bag of pointless expressions in a B-level comedy trying desperately not to insult the concept of ""It's a Wonderful Life."" You really cannot mix charm and slapstick. More importantly, you figure out this one from the start which makes a majority of the movie pointless. (Spoilers Ahead). The movie makes no attempt to hide its heavy handed hint this is all a dream, which makes it hard to be invested in the diabolical that will become this man's pathetic and empty life. Ultimately, we end up not caring about our ""hero"" one way or the other."
3,Adam Sandler's Wonderful Life,"Not a bad Adam Sandler vehicle, it's got some good scenes and good lines. Like so many other movies, beginning with the classic It's a Wonderful Life, and continuing on as recently as The Family Man, it's a supernatural-enabled paean to middle-class values and to the ever-sought, but seemingly never achieved without divine intervention, goal of ""family comes before work."" The plot allows you to always stay a step ahead, and is both never too daring nor too timid. Overall, it's worth a rental."
3,Click,"This was a good movie. I have seen better story lines from Adam Sandler, but his comedic acting is still him. Not a total disappointment, but not his best."
4,Click,"Whish I had had one of those things a long time ago. Not Sandler's best, but is decent family movie"
4,Tragicomedy,"This is the first Adam Sandler movie that made me cry. And I'm a guy for God's sake! I like it better when he makes me laugh. But this movie did get me to do alot of soul searching. It's also nice to know what happens in the Beyond part of Bed, Bath and Beyond."
5,Great!,Hey I Love this movie!! It makes you appreciate things! I cried at the end! and Adam Sandler is always funny NO MATTER WHAT OTHER PPL SAY! I love him!!! This movie is super funny! I recommend it to every1!!Pris!
3,"I laughed , I cried. But could be cleaned up.","I would totally give this movie a 5 star rating but I watched it with my 10 year old daughter and thought it could be cleaned up a bit. There are parts in this movie that really didn't need to be in it and still maintain it's integrity. A dog humping a stuffed toy more then once in a movie is not funny just disgusting and inappropriate for kids. Without these scenes this movie could have been for all ages, but I guess in this day and age that's asking for too much."
1,This had so much promise,"Who hasn't fantasized about being able to stop time, with all the fun and depraved stuff you could do? Unfortunately Adam Sandler was not the one to do it. This movie had such promise with this topic and Sandler's juvenile humor, but this turned into the old cliche of ""you don't know what you have until you loose it"" scenario. The movie trailer had all the funny parts of the film. This ""comedy"" had too much sickness, depression, sadness and death in it, and should have been advertised as such."
2,Soo primitive,"The movie is a about a guy, who does a lot of work and no fun and then feels sorry about that. That's pretty much the whole story. Well, the idea is quite powerful but not new, the characters are done in the ""comics"" style and very primitive, the jokes are quite boring.Actually what is really amazing, that it could've been ok to watch as a family movie, but a few really tasteless jokes made it PG13 rated without adding any fun, so the movie about family values is not appropriate for kids.Too boring for adults, not appropriate for kids, too much moral for young crowd - I can't really think who might like it."
2,NOT THAT GOOD,"The movie gets your interest with the special remote he obtains but then it lost me entirely with the same old toilet humor that they seem to put in just about every comedy movie today. The desk scene with his boss was just so gross that I didn't enjoy the rest of the movie. Then it got a little too dramatic for a movie that it doesn't know what to be, a comedy or a drama. The Wedding Singer is still his best work."
5,Click DVD Review,"Adam Sandler does a great job in this DVD movie about a father and husband who consistently puts his career over his family, thinking all the time that it was in his family's best interest.The story is about a mysterious universal remote given to him that helps him fast forward or rewind various aspects of life. At first this was helpful and convenient for him, but all too soon, the remote programming begins to take on a life of it's own, from what he originally programmed it to do.The story is a modern take of scrooge in many ways reminding me of that theme. In today's modern culture, it is thought provoking about work and life balance. Highly recommend it."
3,Not What Was Expected,"When I initially rented this, it was under the assumption that this was going to be a hilarious comedy movie (typical of Adam Sandler). However, the movie is actually quite serious with little bits of comedy strewn throughout. It was a good movie to watch if you want a film with a somewhat serious plot; however, if you want a comedy, then I would recommend one of Adam's older films."
3,Not too bad,"I was entertained by this movie, though I wouldn't call it ""great."" I was actually suprised that it was as good as it was, because I really didn't want to see it. There was a few parts that were unnecessary and that seemed pointless to me, such as the duck scenes that kept reoccuring. Overall, I would say that it was a pretty good movie. It made me think about my life in a way(but not like it changed my feelings toward life or anything). I would reccomend watching the movie, but I would not reccomend buying it or going to see it in theaters; maybe rent it when it comes out on DVD."
5,"Good vehicle for the ""new"" Sandler","I've always been a fan of Adam Sandler if only because I'm a fan of ""silly"". ""Happy Gilmore"" is still the best, but I enjoyed ""Click"" a lot. Sandler has matured quite a bit since his precocious beginning, and this role fits him well. Special effects are used to good advantage, and the Oscar nominated make-up of Rick Baker took this trip to the future with verve and imagination. I can think of many films that have had a similar theme (how would my life be if...), and ""Click"" has it's own personality. The acting is fine, with, I thought, Kate Beckinsale's finest performance, rife with wit and development. Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner are great together, and David Hasselhoff plays a parody of himself as if nothing else could be more fun. Christopher Walken, too, is fine as Morty, the catalyst of all the craziness. I thought the film was insightful, instructive and quite sweet-natured. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would."
4,Seems to work great for starting plants,"Seems this product is best for getting your seeds to take off and root fast, looking forward to seeing how it helps with the garden outdoors. Does well with house plants"
3,don't know if it helps or not,I haven't really had the need to use this but have tried it germinating seeds and I could not tell the difference.
2,Lose cap and contents leaked out and dried up inside the plastic bag it came in.,Would be great if it was sealed tightly and full 4 oz was received. 4 oz isn't a lot to begin with.
3,SUPERTHRIVE 4 OZ,MY WIFE USED IT ON HERE DAYLILY SEEDLINGS AND IT SEEMED TO WORK VERY WELL. THEY SEEMED TO ROOT AND SPROUT SOONER THAN NORMAL.
2,Hokus Pokus,"I am a master gardener and have tried pretty much every additive, bio and synthetic supposed plant helper on the market. I have actually done controlled experiments with this product on 5 peppers (5 with 5 without) and found ABSOLUTELY NO difference with it. No difference at all! Im sure it has vitamins in it as it smells like one in the bottle but you can get better results with AZomite for a ton cheaper. Dont expect a jack in the beanstalk story because its not magic and its nothing special but a multi vitamin in a bottle. Its hokus pokus claims in my book. Just look at the label and see the circus of claims which are not proven.Stick with good old fashioned compost and it will blow you away."
1,Did nothing for my plants.,I wouldn't waste my money on this again. It did nothing for any of the plants I put it on. Some of them even died. This stuff is a joke.
4,Works but...,"I've used this on and off for a couple years now, typically when I feel my plants need a boost. I'm in Virginia and used a mixture of compost bin material, manure, sand, and regular soil. It does work for a boost but wouldn't use it all the time. BTW who waters their plants every single day? Ever heard of drowning and rotting your plant's roots?Anyway I have friends in different states using similar soil mixture to mine and SOME have good success with this and some do not.I recommend getting your soil tested by your local extension office and letting the analysis tell you what's in your soil and what you may be lacking. They'll also give you advice on how best to add these nutrients. For houseplants I've found adding some osmocote or the fertilizer sticks that have been around for years will give your houseplants all the nutrients they need.Cheers."
4,Superthrive my plants,There is not alot that can be said about this product that hasnt already been said. This Bvitamin is good for plants and an ex additive to my Brew Tea for spray and base watering
3,Unsure about resolutes,I've used this per the supplied directions. Unsure how well it really works. I don't yield results like they promise on YouTube. Unsold just yet. Perhaps Summer 2013 will bring better results.
5,good stuff,"While not technically a plant food, this vitamin product makes a big difference in the vitality and overall well being of my many varieties of houseplants. Give it a try."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This stuff is a waste of money, i bought some at a grow shop for all my plants and used them on my green beans and maple trees and it caused protruding defined areas on the leaves,stunted growth, halted growth and left my garden going no where. it will either kill your plants or it will cause them to never grow again while staying green.your leaves will start to deform and it WILL NOT benefit plants at all. i used this on a dying plant and it mutated it. please save your plants lives and DO NOT USE THIS its a scam."
3,superthrive,The Superthrive was suggested to my by a friend who lives in Texas. So far it appears to work as described but it's too early to tell.
2,Helpful?,"This book does have words written in both cyrillic and latin alphabet, but the latin is NOT correct for some letters. The majority of commonly used words are not in this book. I would recommend for a beginner, but not for someone trying to translate anything of importance."
2,Too few words,"Many of the words that my Serbian friends use in daily conversation are not even in this little book. Also, I have no interest in learning Cyrillic and this book is focused on that instead of the Latin letters. I wish I had not bought this book."
2,Perhaps a little too concise,"I've found the choice of vocabulary in this book fairly unsatisfying, even though it says right on the cover that it's a ""concise"" dictionary. I don't have a problem with the Serbian words appearing only in the Cyrillic alphabet--I kind of need the practice anyway--but I'm surprised and disappointed by how often I have turned to this book for help with a word and come up empty-handed."
4,It does the job,"I am Slobodan Steve Lohja a Montonegrin born in the States (first generation). My wife is American. My Family doesn't speak english very well. They only know the basic words to get around. My wife has a hard time understanding them. Its frustrating for both sides. So I took it upon my responsibility to go out and get her a translation type book. She was excited when she received it. She ran upstairs and started playing with the words in this dictionary with my mom and aunt ""tetka"". They were up there a at least an hour. To bring people together and to bring communication between your wife and mom is best stress releiver. To me this dictionary would be priceless. The only thing its lacking, It doesnt teach you the alphabet, and how to pronounce the words, just definitions. Now my wife and my mom can help each other by one learning serbian and the other learning english, wish them luck!"
4,Great Bible,"This is just what someone needs for overseas ministries. I like the size of the print, easy to read, and easy for Spanish speaking people to understand. I am buying more to take with me on my next trip to Central America."
4,Snow flower and the secret fan,I loved the Joy Luck Club and thought it was excellent The snow flower and the secret fan was produced by the same producer so it should be great too.
4,Great movie - almost as good as book!,This is a great story of Laotong - Sisters forever from China. The book is a great read if you haven't seen it and the movie is almost as good.
3,Not as good as the book,"The movie focus was on a present day situation, not at all what I was expecting at all with the movie"
4,Snow flower,"This was a great movie it touched my heart. The relationship between the two sisters was one of a kind and rare. The movie was so well done, I loved it!"
1,Way to ruin a beautiful book,I recently finished reading the book and thoroughly enjoyed it. I looked forward to seeing the movie so I could view the rich history and culture. What a disappointment. Adding the modern day story made the movie very difficult to understand and ruined a beautiful reading experience.
2,curious mixture,I found the story hard to follow and more or less requires you know what it is about before you start. Hopping about from Mandarin to various heavily accented variants of English became very tiring and the music often obscured the dialogue. By implication the relationships are lesbian but this is not explicit. The Hugh Jackman cameo is a joke and degrades the film. I could not get into it at all and do not expect to watch this a second time.
2,Disappointed,I was extremely disappointed in the video for Snow Flower and the Secret Fan. I had already read the book and found the video to go in a different direction from the book. I would have enjoyed more of the content from the book and not the modern story that was brought into the video. In the beginning I thought I had bought the wrong video.The book without this other drama of the modern day situation of the girls stands alone as a terrific story. It's a shame that the story wasn't left alone on it's own merit.
1,Takes Place in Modern Shanghai,"I don't normally write reviews, but I have to for this movie...I found it while browsing and was excited to see it because I LOVED the book. About 5 minutes into the movie I was confused, thinking it was another story with the same title...but I kept watching and discovered it is a different story with the same title, but is based on Lisa See's book. Loosely.It's completely baffling to me as to why anyone would think to butcher Ms. See's powerful story like this in a movie like this....seriously, WHY?? The book is so beautiful, and this could have been a great movie too! Basically, the story is about two girls in MODERN Shanghai who are sworn sisters. It's superficial at best and neither storyline- the modern one or the flashbacks to the old story- are properly developed. Maybe the twist was that Snow Flower and Lily reincarnated as these two girls, but in any case it's a big massive fail.Go read the book, it's truly superb."
2,"Two stories in one, but not enough story in either one","While the acting and cinematography were great, there was far too little substance in either of the two parralel stories in this movie. By taking the book's story and running it as a parrallel to the protagonists in the containing story, set in modern times, it fails to add enough character development to either story, which would be fine, but this movie is all about the characters and the special bond they shared."
2,Very disappointing,"I give the film 2 1/2 stars. I am one of those bookworms that prefers the book and like the other bookworms was truly hoping that the movie would have some resemblance to the book. Why did there had to be a present time and WHY did Hugh Jackman have to be in this movie!? I felt his character like that of Nina and Sophia were mostly pointless to the central plot. I much prefer the story related to the times of Snow Flower and Lily rather than Nina and Sophia. If you love to read, read the book, if you like slow movies this one is a good match. While the acting wasn't terrible I don't recommend the movie."
1,Let down from book,Horrible let down from the book. Very few ancient customs depicted. Filial relationships lacking. No character development.... No need to interweave future relatioship with that of the two girls from the past. Wasted valuable time and left out so much!
1,Bitter Disappointment,"Loved the book, hated the movie. The modern story line and its characters did not exist in the book and failed miserably. It's not a matter of the expected changes or omissions that typically take place when a movie is made based on a book. In this case well over half the movie had nothing at all to do with the Lisa See's beautiful story about Snowflower and Lily. Very glad I didn't spend the money to drive 6 hours round trip to see this in a theater!"
1,Not like the book,"This movie was a disappointment. I was expecting to see a movie version of the book. This is not it. This would have been such a wonderful movie if it did not include a parallel modern storyline. I would have loved to see a version faithful to the book. If you haven't read the book, read the book and skip the movie."
3,Not sure how to rate this,"If I had never read the book, this film would have somewhat satisfied me. It's not a horrible movie by any means. So three stars would be my rating. But having read the book, I was disappointed that the creators of the film felt that the addition of a modern twist was needed. This only served to weaken the story of Lily and Snow Flower and theirs is by far the more interesting story. It is not allowed to develop as it did in the book and so the movie does not begin to have the richness of the novel."
2,Ehhh,I watched the movie after I read the book. Almost nothing is the same. They didnt do anything by the book at all. And skipped very important parts of the book. I know movies arent going to have ever last detail of the book but it wasnt even really about the book. It was mainly focused on 2 girls in the present and when they do go to the past it is very short and no details or anything. If i didnt read the book then it would be an ok movie. But it sucks.Get a new director for this movie
1,Snow Flower and the Secret Fan,"I had read the book and was very excited to see the film. However, the DVD was faulty and kept skipping sections of the story. We cleaned the DVD, but we were never able to view the complete film and finally gave up. The film used subtitles which made it difficult to follow the story at times. Also, the film followed two story lines, present and past; in the novel, only the story from the past was presented. All in all, I loved the book, but the film was a disappointment."
2,Very disappointed,Absolutely loved the book. Very disapointed that Lisa See would approve yet alone produce this film. Would have been much better if she would have stuck to the book version and not adapt anything years later...nothing like the book. What a disappointment. No wonder the film never came to the Toledo area.
1,Don't watch this!!!!,I read this book for book club and loved it. Hated this movie! We all fell asleep watching it. It mixed a modern times story in with the narrative of the book and made it difficult to follow. Most the movie is not in English and must be read with subtitles. If you enjoyed this book you will be disappointed! I was embarrassed that I suggested that we watch it.
1,disappointed - under titles,"I was extremely disappointed when the majority of the story had english undertitles. I fell asleep within 10 min of watching the movie. I love history, but did not like the modern day actors/corelations to the ancient snowflower and lily."
3,Okay,It was okay. A little confusing with all the different flashbacks but the film was well done. Maybe 3 1/2 stars.
3,Forget you ever read the book and this movie will be okay.,"This movie hit a few of the major plot points from the book, but did so as back-story for the main story line of the movie. For a wonderful journey, read the book."
1,SNOW FLOWER AND THE SECRET FAN,"RECEIVED IN GOOD CONDITION, BUT THE BLUERAY DVD WILL NOT PLAY AT ALL, I TRIDED MY REGULAR PLAYER AND DIDN'T WORK ON THAT EITHER, HAD TO ASK TO RETURN FOR A REFUND....WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS"
3,"Snow Flower, the movie","Very little of this movie was applicable to the book. I plan to use the book with my sophomore honors class, but don't feel that the movie will accurately support the reading. There are a few passages that will help with visualization - the footbinding and the flight to the mountains. But the general theme would only appeal to an older audience."
2,This Is Not Snow Flower and the Secret Fan,"Compared to the book, this film is missing the substance of the girls' close relationship. Sweet and loving moments shared between the girls as well as painful traditions they endure in the novel are glazed over to make way for the modern storyline taken on in the movie. The combination of the modern and ancient narratives sacrificed the quality and detail of both stories. I know people always say the book is better than the movie, but in this case, the movie plot is so different from the novel that I'm not even sure you can call this film ""Snow Flower and the Secret Fan.""Without comparing it to the book, this movie tried to follow two very deep-rooted and complicated relationships and I didn't feel emotionally connected to either due to a lack of detailed exploration. However, if you're into Asian female dramas, although this film ranks far below the likes of ""The Joy Luck Club"" and ""The Vertical Ray of the Sun"", it may satisfy your itch."
3,My Opinion,I read the book before I viewed the dvd and I was disappointed that the movie did not follow the book more. Although I enjoyed watching a little different take on the story line presented by the movie I actually prefer the book. In my opinion the book was far better.
2,Tres chic,"Oops, I meant 'tres chick.' The movie cuts back and forth between pairs of friends centuries apart, one in the time when Chinese women's feet were bound, the other in the current day. Back then, social norms very nearly created segregated worlds for men and women, especially in the upper classes. As a result, friendships between women had a special closeness.Despite the lovely actresses, especially Bingbing Li, the story came across as inert. I didn't gain insight from comparing the two friendships, and that's really all the movie tried to offer. If you love ""relationships"" movies, then Snow Flower might suit you. I'm a guy who likes guy movies, though, and this was too chicky for me.-- wiredweird"
3,Look for the meaning.....,"As someone who read, and loved, Lisa See's Book i understand why so many are grumbling. They have taken too many artistic liberties with the film and you lose the some of the richness. People who havent read the book may like it but those of us who have, feel the loss of the depth of the characters. STILL the movie has a good message and im glad i watched it. Snow Flower and the secret fan is my favorite book of Lisa See's and i wish she wouldve demanded they do more with the script. It felt like we just skimmed the surface of the lives of these women."
1,Snow Flower and the Secret Fan,"The book was so good, and the DVD is so bad, what a total waste of money - they should write on the cover, doesn't follow the book hardly at all."
1,Delivered in poor condition,"These boots arrived with three separate blue ink stains on them, as well as a dark sticky spot of glue on the front that won't come off. Not sure if I'll return them since they were only $12.00..."
5,You'd be doing youself a great disservice by not owning this,"Echo and the Bunnymen peaked early in my opinion. There is not a happy moment on this release. In fact, the word ""happy"" is only used as a modifier to the phrase ""death men."" Listen to this CD only in the dark, and imagine that Jim Morrison resurrected himself from the bloated-dead-guy-in-the-bathtub scene, took a junket to Liverpool, and allied himself with some guys who could sing about Happy Death Men with a straight face. And without all that Ray Manzarek noodling, that's exactly what the Bunnymen sound like here."
4,Better than their later recordings,"Emerging from the 80's wave underground, Echo and the Bunnmymen introduced spooky, ethereal elements into the scene. At times reminiscent of early U2, Echo and the Bunnymen created fragmented textures which combine to create a musical picture -- possibly of the psychedelic forest on the cover?, or maybe a ghost inhabited abandoned factory... But don't worry. The atmospherics don't get in the way of these songs also being hummbaly good pop songs."
5,A classic from a great band,"Echo & The Bunnymen took a different approach to their music during a time when synths were really cool. Don't get me wrong, I bought a ton of British electro pop. And alot of it was actually good. Crocodiles took a dark turn into a realm that was seldom explored. You will see all kinds of labels asociated with their sound but I think Echo & the Bunnymen were the originators of a style of music that people still try to copy today with little success. Crocodiles is loaded with great songs. Along with Heaven Up Here, these are their two finest recordings."
4,"dark pop milestone, still very listenable","When I listened to ""Crocodiles"" for the first time I was in grad school, conditioned to listen to the folk- and acid-rock legends I'd grown up with (Neil Young, the Dead), adverse to the newer stuff coming out of Britain. I'm not sure what event led me to start diversifying, but soon I was listening to Gang of Four and Teardrop Explodes. The first time I heard ""Crocodiles"" I thought the music dark and sinister, its pop sensibilities colored with a disturbing nihilism. I came to love ""Crocodiles"" and I still listen to it (the CD replaced the vinyl), but only at certain times and in certain moods: it can be that affecting.""Echo and the Bunnymen"" remains, however, a supremely [bad] name for a band."
2,I just don't get it,"Echo & The Bunnymen, are one of those bands (like My Bloody Valentine or Depeche Mode) that everyone tells me I am going to like, but don't. I am a huge fan of a lot of 80's brit-pop (The Smiths, The Cure, Aztec Camera, etc.) but these songs just don't compel me. I will say the guitar playing is excellent and these guys really gel together as a band, but the melodies are not exceptional and the songwriting lackluster. Maybe this is not a good place to start or maybe I am too young (or old) to ""get"" this band, but I have to be honest: Not impressed.'"
1,Good album but a terrible remake,"I don't understand why we are being sold extra tracks in here that were not ""extra"" but a part of the original album. The order is all messed up. They could have done a better job. The album cover is so small. What gives? This is one of the best albums ever and it deserves better."
1,not what product descriptions states!!!!,I just received for my husband what i thought was a power ice auger.... from what the product description list stated. The item is actually only the replacement unit not the whole thing.Please list your items correctly!
4,The Mystery Of Grace,"Here's a new one, a Christian Murder Mystery set in Vancouver, written by a Canadian author named James R. Coggins.John Smyth a magazine editor coming back from a conference looks down while the plane starts it's descent and believes he sees a murder occurring.Once on the ground, he reports the sighting to the RCMP. Not taking him seriously they push it off as jet lag or him just seeing things. Until two weeks later when the body of a girl with the only identifying thing on her body is a necklace with a pendent on it. The pendent has the word Grace etched in to it. The connection to John Smyth?The magazine he edits is called Grace magazine.While trying to clear his name, John begins to talk to his pastor friends, they in turn talk to others and a list is formed of possible missing persons. Eventually the truth is found out.... But the outcome? I cannot tell. You'll have to read the book."
4,Infamous,"The story of a bureaucrat who had no regard for human life. Despite his claim of trying to better the lives of prisoners, he reigned over a hell on earth. The lack of emotion in his description of the process of extermination of people from all over Europe is sickening. This book is not for the faint of heart."
4,Unbelievable,"To read this is both fasinating and horrific. I couldn't put it down, I cried, I was angered, and I even laughed at his blatant lies. He was more worried about where he was going to get construction items than he was in the millions he let die. Following orders was his oath...what happened to common human decency? Hoess claims that he was not allowed to think about saving anybody's life but to the total destruction of not only the Jews, but other races as well. This story was written by a Nazi insider...shame on those who say the holocaust never happened. He had too easy a death, he should have been put through the same horrors he put innocent people through...good riddance to him and his kind."
4,"Ordinary men, doing unspeakable horrors","This memoir is amazing, because it shows how someone so ordinary- maybe not much different than others in society, can sink to the depths of atrocity and assist with organized murder. Hoess matter of factly states everything he did, which was quite a bit. Hitler, Heydrich and Himmler may have been the architects of genocide, but it was mechanics like Hoess and Eichmann who allowed the Holocaust to happen. Highly recommended."
3,No Great Revelations.,"Remarkable primarily in the fact that it exists at all, and frankly recommended solely on that basis. The memoir of SS-Obersturmbannfuehrer Hoess will disappoint those used to the dramatics, overarching moralizations, and lurid examples of grisly sadism generally a mainstay of books on this topic (and seemingly promised by the foreward and cover blurbs). Hoess was largely a narrow-minded bureaucratic functionary, and as such transcendant revelations about his role at Auschwitz Birkenau are not forthcoming.Technically, the translation is quite sloppy in places, and there are numerous quite inexplicable German misspellings throughout."
4,Testimony of the monster,"I bought this book to see the ""other side"" point of viewThe view from the hantchman eyes.Well, I think this book is worth reading, not only to see see how cruel and perverse one can get but olso how hatred can lead to unimaganable crime.Hoss writes this book from prison...His writing is honest although he trys to ""whitewash"" hisactions and blames his subordinates for lots of attrocities which happened in Auschwitz.I think this book is a very good source to see how quickly one can become a real monster, when following insane idiology."
4,Amazing,"To see what a person can do to another person(s) is amazing. To think he was thinking of becoming a priest and goes on to murder millions of people, saying it was his duty!Whether it was all 100% accurate or not - is of no significance to me.What i learned - was how a human being can hurt others the way he did.No excuse - guilty!Let's all pray - no madman like this ever gets this type of chance againTerry"
1,Wrong part even though I entered car,"The gasket was the wrong size even though we had entered are car and it said this was the correct part for our car. After we received the water pump we saw that the gasket was included. The return process was very quick and easy, our money was promptly refunded and we are very satisfied with the whole process. We will buy from amazon again, unlike the thief's on Ebay we will never buy there again."
3,Inconsistent,"Worked inconsistently on multiple tires that needed it. Some sealed fine, others didn't seal. But, it's still easier than changing tubes or making a more definitive repair."
4,Slime saves the day.,This stuff really does stop holes in tires from leaking. Saves you time and money replacing wheels.
1,Horrible quality but great soundtrack,"I recieved this by mistake, I'd actually ordered Rosemary's Baby. I love the film, so I had to listen to the soundtrack. The sound quality is SO BAD I can hardly listen to it. It's bad. I mean it's really bad. It sounds like you are listening to it through a pillow, through a wall, and over traffic. This hurts 'cause the music is great! I love this composer's work. If only I could hear the music with any sort of clarity this one would be a keeper. But, with the quality as awful as it is, I want my money back. If they ever re-issue a cleaned up version, I'll be the first in line. Until then, save your money."
4,A good read!,"This is a good book about a fourteen year old girl who came from the phillipines for her first year of high school. She goes through different changes and tries to adapt to the American lifestyle, and also by trying to be popular at school too. This is a good book if you want to read something good or just want to read about highschool life."
3,Sweet book,"Charming 'naif' style paintings, while the text is based on Henry Van Dykes story of 4 wise men.4 wise men set out to find the King of Kings and this is the story of the last one, Artaban.Because compassion delayed him, time and again, he spends many years searching. However, to everyone he encounters, Artaban behaved with greatest charity until at last he reaches Damascus and gives away his last posession and gift.The emphasis of the story is on Artaban living by the principals which Jesus would teach without discriminating against peoples of different faiths or races.The described goal of the book: ""showing how we can turn disappointment to good account; and how our outer journey through life is mirrored by the inner journey of the soul.""I rather liked it. The illustrations are simple watercolours and quite nice, with a good map at the front, and are a fine accompaniment to the story.It's a nice story for Christmas or any time.kotori"
2,Good enough but...,"These are NOT professional quality business cards. They should be on 110 lb card paper. In all honesty Avery has to sort of play to the lowest common denominator. My printer will take 110 lb but many will not. These are more like 65 lb card stock. They do seem to print well with a good printer.They are called ""Linen Texture"" but they are not really that, more like a rough matte finish. If you look at them with a magnifier you can see something like a texture. They work for me as I laminate them in 5-mil sleeves to make them stiff and moisture resistant.The Avery 8371 Template works in Word 2007 but is really buggy. It's free and worth every penny. You will have to paste and resize each frame of the template individually. You may have to print testers. I print one on cheap bond paper and match it up over a light box.I use these and make them work but they are not as good as Avery would like you to believe."
2,Beware smudges,Nearly half of the sheets in the package had weird blue smudges or drag marks on them. Basically made them unusable. Thank goodness I didn't need all the sheets in the pack!
1,Epic Fail on my Epson NX625 ink jet printer.,"There is a special place in the hereafter reserved for this product.There is nothing in the vendor's marketing information or product description about which ink jet printers this works or does not work with. Only that it is for ""Ink Jet"". On my Epson NX625 ink jet, an otherwise trustworthy and very reliable little desktop printer, this product fails to feed and print.I wasted a lot of expensive ink, an hour of my time, and a couple dozen sheets of this product to yield a total of twelve -- count 'em, twelve -- usable business cards. I have a trashcan of smeared and bent card stock to show for the rest of that hour.Next time I'll go with the 250 pcs. for $10 over the internet, from other printing vendors."
2,Bad templates good quality paper,"This is a waste of time for card designs that need centering. The templates are completely useless. I wasted hours trying to get them to line up on while copier paper, so I don't waste the Avery. The template I used was for Photoshop. I'm good with Photoshop so it wasn't me, it was the template. I tried the word version template also thinking maybe it's easier, it's more useless. The paper quality is good and looks similar to the professionally printed stack - that's why it's getting 2 stars instead of 1. I would recommend this only if you don't need to center your design, or you'll hate it."
1,"This product says ""cheap""","Avery is living on its reputation, and like other companies that try this, their reputation is going down fast...Cards can only be printed one side (no indication of this on box or in literature); also, they had problems w/ink spotting (not printer related)."
4,Crisp and Clear,I really like the print quality of these business cards. I have a Kodak Hero 7.1 printer and I printed a picture along with business lettering on these cards and the print quality was excellent. The only thing I dislike is I had to reconfigure my printing margins to get them to match with Microsoft Publisher.
5,a beautiful photograph,"Reading this book was for me like looking at a family album while my host (whose album this is) tells me about the photographs quietly, gently, his sad eyes fixed on the back of my head. And as I looked I realized that the photographs (the still lives captured on this page and that) are photos of photos of photos; that behind them simmer reflections of things not in the image itself; that they are photos of the same scene but taken with many cameras, seen with many eyes; and slowly, gradually I realize that I am in the photographs also-a kind of ghost guided inside by my host-and I step in and look around.Until finally, I come to the last photograph in the album (not the last photograph; just the last photograph in that particular album) and I look at it, at its grey rain, at its sadness and I don't close the album.That is what reading this incredible book is like-and that is why I heartily recommend it to anyone who ever hesitated to speak of himself, his family, his heart."
2,Boring,"I love reading about all things Jewish and Israeli so when I picked this up at Barnes and Noble I was excited...until I opened it up. I couldn't for the life of me get into it. This book seriously won an award? After several times of picking it up and getting bored, I sold it to a used book shop. Sad!"
4,Moments of virtuosity,Same old sardonic whimsey. Repetitive intellectual arrogance. Recapitulated old political arguments as if they remain coherent living issues. Profound things have happened to Israel. Time has passed Amos Oz by.
5,"Longtime readers of Oz say ""This is his masterwork""","A number of long- time readers of Amos Oz have said that this is by far his greatest work and a true masterpiece.They say his evocation of the Jerusalem world of the thirties and forties is unmatched. That his description of his problematic and tremendously interesting intellectually overcharged family is done with dignity and distance which is nonetheless heartwarming.They say that Oz born to the right and having lived his political life largely as champion of the left provides a balanced picture of the fundamental political argument which has divided the Israeli public for years.They say that this story of a family is also one of the most convincing evocations of the early years of Israel .They speak of it as a gripping, moving read from start to finish.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
2,Kin g salomon's mines is a very poor place after all!!!,"made in usa fake product of steven spielberg's riders of the lost ark. laughable. it is the first ""comic"" adventure ever made! absolutely poor"
2,UNBELIEVABLE MUSICAL SCORE!,"It is not a good movie. Richard Chamberlain does not fit as Alan Quatermain, but Sharon Stone is shining. It is not faithful to H. Rider. Haggard's book, but it is a very nice script with great characters such as the bold nazi militar who's crazy with Wagner's music. If there's something that saves this movie is the original musical score by Jerry Goldsmith. It's something so beautiful and full of energy that doesn't deserve to be in such a bad movie (the special effects are worser than the ones used by Ed Wood jr). Yes, you must see this movie so as to fall in love with Goldsmith's music. If adventure has a name, it must be ""Indiana Jones"", but if ""King Solomon's mines"" would have been properly shot, Allan Quatermain and Jerry Goldsmith's music would have made an excellent competition for Indy and Jhon Williams outstanding score."
1,Region 2 King Solomon's Mines DVD,"In the area where I purchased the video on Amazon, it did not have anything about region 2 videos not playing on video players in the US. I am very unhappy about having a brand new video I cannot even play. There is something on the original link at the bottom saying it will not play on players in the US, but if you miss that, you are in for a big suprise."
4,Would H. Rider be proud?,"I dont know if Haggard would like his story changed up so much, but just watching the beautiful young Sharon Stone certainy makes it worthwhile"
1,dvd purchase.,"this DVD did not work at all , very disappointed !bought this as a gift and now I look like a idiot for buying it on line. i must say amazon is usually really good . very upset with this ."
1,A poem...,"...""King Solomon's Mines"", ""King Solomon's Mines"" why in the hell did I waste my time? The special effects were made with no money and it just ended up looking quite funny. They wanted it to be like Indiana Jones but instead we got crap with Sharon Stone ""King Solomon's Mines"", ""King Solomon's Mines"" this awful film was truly a crime."
1,Indiana Jones RIPOFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This video was horrible!!!! I give it 2 thumbs down!!! Besides being an Indiana Jones ripoff, the dialogue was outrageously stupid. While being shot,whipped,drowning,or jumping out of a moving airplane the characters live!!! We can only pity poor Richard Chamerlain, he must cry every time he thinks about how they talked him into doing this vile movie!"
2,Awful,"Rent/buy the original with Paul Robeson or the spectacular version with Stewart Granger. This is just plain awful, except for the amazing Jerry Goldsmith score, which you can buy separately. And I did see it in the movies, and tried to get my money back."
4,Very friendly deck,"I was unsure of how well I would like this deck when I read the description of the cards. The images are very friendly and they have a very ""nice"" feeling to them. The readings are accurate and have a more positive twist to them. Some of the images are of people from the 1800's and, at first, I found that a bit odd but I realized that for this particular deck, it's perfect. Great for everyday use or to just collect. I was very surprised by this deck and I'm sure others will be too."
3,Spiral Tarot Deck,"As a professional reader, I was drawn to these cards by the images displayed...The standard and the quality of the actual pictures are great, however, I personally feel that there are far too many cards that have deviated from the original sense-meaning...This is solely my own opinion, and others may find them quite adequate...I will not be using them for professional use, for the original 'story' of the Fool has been lost or, sacrificed to make a 'pretty-picture' ... My opinion only ..."
2,Looks like Bubble Gum Trading Cards,"I bought this deck based upon the glowing reviews I'd read here. I was disappointed. The cards are about the size of regular playing cards (smaller than a standard Rider-Waite)--which wouldn't be a bad thing, except that they also have garish graphic purple borders. They make the cards look like cheap bubble gum trading cards. As for the paintings themselves, the artist paints in the styles of various famous (in this case, mostly impressionist and fantasy) painters, and the result often feels a bit inconsistent. I would've liked it if the artist had more of her own developed style. I realize that this is only a tarot deck, and wasn't meant to be a great work of art, but it's worth pointing out. But those borders are so atrocious and distracting that they'd distract from any kind of painting. I don't know what the designers of this deck were thinking.It should also be noted that this deck is supposed to be very celtic."
5,Spiral Tarot,"These cards are wonderful. The artwork is beautiful, and each card tells a story unto itself. The booklet it came with is small and I wish it had more description, but the cards themselves are receptive and perfect for most practical use... not cryptic as many can be, very cool."
2,Art work is fine!,"Pity that the deck forces Golden Dawn Hebrew letter attributions: they are included upon the cards. Via the Waite/Colman Smith deck and the many commentaries discussed in numerous books, these attributions have spread widely, yet, many share the view that these are *not* correct. To have them presented leaves the person unfree to work with letter attributions (if at all) as they so wish, or as they discover differently from deeper study.If it wasn't for this, I would have given it a far higher rating - the artwork is worth a four or five star."
4,Beautiful...,"...and now a part of my collection. The Trump cards are full of information - Qabalah, Astrology - but the pip cards are much more basic. That's OK, but I prefer a deck to have more consistancy in this regard. There are simply better decks for ""reading"" out there in my opinion, but I am happy to have this one in my collection. The art is wonderful."
5,Beautiful deck,"I really like this tarot deck to me it's very intuitive and mystical. I believe this will be one of my favorite decks. I'm a beginner at tarot reading and to me this deck is easy to read. I really like that they have astrological symbols on them. This deck is very beautiful, I highly recommend it."
5,Beautiful but not fluffy,"I became a deck collector sort of by accident (how did that drawer get full of Tarot decks??)... but THIS deck is the one I use constantly. This deck is the one I bought a spare deck of..just in case. It is lovely, yet not that pretty/fluffy look of some of the fantasy type decks. Each card has unique symbolism built into it which really assists with doing a reading without constantly 'looking it up'. I also highly recommend the book that was written for this deck. Very well done."
3,Very Pretty Cards,"This particular deck has some very pretty cards in it. However, it is NOT one of my favorite deck of cards, as I am used to using Oracle cards more than tarot. Had I been accustomed to using tarot more, I would probably like them a whole lot better."
5,classic 1940's music!!!a must for collector!!!,this cd is full of classic 1940's material.It has jingles ballads and other goodies in this cd !!Why it is almost like a audio time machines of a bygone era!!!Buy it at this lower price go for it !!!It 's awesome!!!!a must for people who grew up in the era or just love the music of the time!!!
3,not a class,I could not figure out from the description if this was a class or not. It is not a class but short examples of exercises with some technique guidance.
3,"Interesting history, uninteresting writing","I've come to realize that Piers Anthony is a dirty old man. There wasn't as much sex and rape as was in the first book, but still more than was necessary (none would have probably been just fine.)The storyline in this book is much more congruous throughout the ages unlike the first one. This made it easier to relate to the new surroundings.The history presented is very interesting.One thing I can't stand in books are flashbacks to things that happened earlier in the book. This happens nearly every chapter as the previous events are recounted in the new setting.The last thing that really annoyed me are the names of some of the people. Bb, Ss, Vk, Beebub, Scevo... Seriously, that creative huh? Why no vowels in the neandertal names. They didn't have written language so having unpronounceable names is just stupid."
2,Won't Get Your Heart Beating,"I was disappointed with this video. If you want to get fit, the video is fine for muscle toning but it certainly did NOT make me break a sweat, get my heart beating or make me breathe heavily. I recommend you just watch it 1 or 2x through first to get over the X rated closeups, and to learn the transitions. Then you can move on and focus on actually exercising. Music was forgettable. Lighting was poor and there were a lot of shadows. Often, I was annoyed that the camera was zoomed in extremely close on a body part during a transition to a new move. I needed the camera to pan back showing the whole room so I could follow the next step. Also annoying, was the fact that someone offscreen is narrating or counting out the steps while you see the lead model silently mouthing the count. That made it seem like a cheap foreign film."
2,very disapointed,This book was way over priced for the everyday information that was in it. If a person knows how to sew at all and is around any handicapped persons at all you already know most of the information contained in this book.I was very disapointed
5,Not just for kids!,"I'm an elderly guy who has bought (7) copies so far and given them to my elderly friends. We all love it. This game is great fun, but also practices; problem solving, memory and learning new things. A study here in Davis says that practicing these skills can keep our mental skills 10 years younger than those that don't exercise their minds. My only suggestion is for the software developers to make multiple skill levels so people can build on their success. Ummm what happened to the neighbor's girlfriend after the cruise ship hit the ice cap?"
1,Scammer,"This product is ripped from the original in a way to capture your keystrokes and has a patch to make it work on your computer without a DVD.Play at your own risk if you don't value your privacy and passwords, .exe files have worms/trojans.Very upset amazon in your quality control, I'd expect this from eBay but not here..."
3,"Possibly great, but impenetrable","My sense is that this book is a great book, great in the sense of significant or important, but I found the prose to be impenetrable. It was like wading through molasses: very tasty, but the effort, oh the effort! (I got halfway through Chapter 3 before succumbing to exhaustion.)I give it 5 stars for content and 1 star for the writing, so the average is 3 stars."
4,Great textbook!,"I'm a freshman Psychology student at the University of Amsterdam (The Netherlands)... I used this book to study for my course Biological Psychology (duh!)... Anyway, this book is very organized, good summaries and a clear explanation of all the important concepts... Even if you don't have much knwoledge of biology, you will understand this book... at least I did..."
5,Excellent textbook!,"I use this textbook in my undergraduate physiological psychology course. Kalat is very clear, he uses wonderful illustrations, and the CD is a nice resource. I recommend it for other instructors."
5,brain center at whipples,"Although I have only seen this movie once, and that is when it was originally aired in the 60's, I remember it very clearly. It is a true classic. There is no movie like it. And at this point in time I can see that movie can become reality given the things that are being automated to this day."
4,Excellent sander,"Some of the complaints I read before buying this sander now seem somewhat silly. The tracking adjustment on the machine is awesome and very easy to use. When you change the sanding angle you need to adjust the tracking but this is no problem. The machine is powerful, quiet and has excellent dust collection. The oscillating range is fine, it should never be more than a 1/2 inch. Two improvements could be made to the machine. First, it would be nice to turn off the oscillator when you need a little extra height. Secondly, it would be nice to have a handle crank to adjust the sanding angle. It is not the easiest operation for one person to accurately set the angle. Other than that the machine is perfect."
3,"Great Commentary, Lousy Maps","This campground directory has some great points and some negative points. The commentaries and the descriptions are great. These are not checkmark ratings like you find in other directories, but specific positives and negatives about each rated site. Having stayed at several of these campgrounds, I occur fully with the reviews.The negatives? The maps stink. Presumably, cities on the map marked with a black bullet are listed in one of two sections in the directory. There are numerous cities with a black bullet that simply are not listed anywhere in the directory. Second, a number of the campgrounds are listed under cities that are different from the street addresses given and different from other directories, causing you to search other maps to find the location. The most interesting mistake, however, is on the map on page 60. They have Montana shown where I always thought Utah was, but maybe its revisionist geography."
4,Not yet read it but I know I'll like it:),"That review-title sounds weird, I know, but I've liked Betty Cavanna's/Elizabeth Headley's(sp?) young-adult romance-novels before, and so I'm pretty sure I'll like this one, too. :)It arrived in the mail sooner than the delivery-deadline (always good:) and as soon as I finish reading a coupl'a other books I've already started, I'm going to probably dive into this one.:)Her novels helped me thru a very unhappy time in my life, years ago; they cheered me a good bit, and I thought her writing believable, refreshing, and good."
5,Great Book!,"This is the most complete source of information that you can get on WWII in Europe without expanding to 20 volumes. It has been a invaluable tool on staff rides. For the hobby historian, it is awesome. For a professional historian, it is a condensed bible."
5,Profoundly moving and original,"The elegiac last photographs taken between September 1973 and November 1974, when Evans fell ill, with the Polaroid SX-70, producing square 3 1/8"" x 3 1/8"" instant color prints. Some taken in Hale County, Alabama, in the company of the artist William Christenberry, the region's great chronicler, where thirty years earlier Evans had collaborated with James Agee on Let Us Now Praise Famous Men (1941). Polaroid supplied enough free film for more than 2,650 photographs, acquired in 1994 by The Metropolitan Museum of Art for the Walker Evans Archive. Profoundly moving and original."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I STARTED TO READ THE BOOK WITH MUCH ENTHUSIASM, WHICH QUICKLY CAME TO A HALT. THE AUTHOR BREEZED OVER THE REALLY IMPORTANT PARTS OF MASS SUCH AS THE EUCHARIST, COMMUNION, WHAT MASS IS ALL ABOUT AND EXTENDED THE CHAPTERS ON PLANNING WEDDINGS, AND PARTIES FOR WEDDINGS, BAPTISMS, COMMUNION, ETC. THE AUTHOR NEVER GOT INTO WHAT EACH RITE OF PASSAGE IS ALL ABOUT, WHY WE CELEBRATE THE RITE. I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT WHY WE DO THE THINGS WE DO IN CHURCH, NOT HOW TO PLAN THE PARTY AFTER THE WEDDING OR BAPTISM. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS BOOK AND WISH I COULD GET MY MONEY BACK. IF YOU WANT A MORE IN DEPTH EXPLANATION FOR WHY WE DO THE THINGS WE DO IN CHURCH AND WHAT MASS IS ALL ABOUT, THIS IS NOT THE BOOK FOR YOU."
3,Not too factual,"Although the author does touch on some areas that need to be addressed, I was disappointed on the organization and presentation of the material.There still are many rules of etiquette since Vatican II, not much was wiped out, just the American population has become so casual that the true etiquette isn't presented. We can see that truth in modern weddings. The ""rules"" are still out there, just so many people choose to ignore them or are ignorant.The author presents many of the issues, like ""Children at Mass"" not with a definitive, ""do this"", but more with a ""if you feel inclined..."""
2,MINTEK OWNER CALLED ..and left a nasty voicemail message,"1700 model broke after 2uses..finally talked to human at mintek cutomer service,sent unit back got call from mintek that unit couldnt b fixed & send more cash for new one shipped free.contacted BBB,filed complaint,manager from Mintek called after BBB contacted him & left a very nasty message on our voicemail..swearing at us.got new model after 3 plays the battery charger stopped working only plays with electric.NEVER BUY MINTEKThey got sued back in 2/2007 read for yourselfhttp://www.mpegla.com."
1,"not chanting, not Buddhist","This is a collection of Chinese pop-folk renditions of Buddhist texts with flute and erhu in the foreground and synthesized big band in the background. As Bohdidharma would say, it is a slander on Buddhism. For those seeking Buddhist music (if there is such a thing), I would advise solo shakuhachi from Japan (traditional zen works, not the modern pop improvisations, of course)."
3,"WONDERFUL PREMISE, PROMISING PLOT, BUT FELL SHORT","I loved the way I felt as I opened up this book and began to read. The promise of a thumping good read in historical fiction-- my favorite. But as I read on, the story is continuously, unexpectedly , interrupted by odd segments of gratuitous sex that read as if they were inserted to satisfy the romance genre. While I loved the premise of the heroine and hero, their characters did not captivate me. The character development somehow did not have me giving a darn about these people. I'd turn the page and end up somewhere lost in a sudden change of scene. My personal review of three stars was given due to the wonderful historical detail and plot, not to the writing itself. But I would read something of hers again...there's something that smells of promise here. This book just wasn't as fulfilling as I had hoped. Perhaps my expectations were too high. But a good read overall, and as I mentioned earlier, excellent historical detail!"
5,Devoted,"As one of the previous reviewers mentioned, I picked this book on sale at a local book store. Since I am fascinated with the idea of the supernatural, I found this book fascinating. Ms. Borchhardt has incredible ability to describe in detail the background and surroundings of her characters. This is not a boring read, instead you feel as if you are in the era of time. Her writing in some way surpasses her sister's work. I look forward to reading future books."
3,Devote your time to something else,"This is the first novel that I have read by Alice Borchardt. I found the beginning to be enthralling, but as the story dragged on, I got bored with the common use of language. It felt as if the novel was written so that it could easily be made into a B Hollywood movie.The book was much too predictable. I don't think that I will purchase the sequel, 'Beguiled.' However, I may give the author another chance with her latest novel 'The Silver Wolf.'"
3,A teensy bit better than the average bodice-ripper.,"The liner notes claimed this book was ""an intricate, superbly researched tapestry of the Middle Ages"", which gave me hope. And it IS readable, but I was disappointed to discover it was basically just another bodice-ripper. I had hoped to find a book that told a story of this historical era, warts and all. However, in the Borchardt world of the Middle Ages there is excessive rhapsodizing over the ebony hair and ivory skin of the heroine. I was looking for a fine, hearty meal of a book, but this one is more like movie theater popcorn. You enjoy it, but it's not filling, and there's a nagging thought in the back of your mind that it's just empty calories."
4,Battle reaelm of love!,Devoted is one of the most fantastic book of 1995! Why did this book didn't get any awards or nominations? I like it! The part where Owen was talking to Hakon is sooo cool I couldn't believe it! Encore to this book!
1,Book of Jasher,"The Book of Jasher Has 91 Chapters, But not this Book. A wast of money for anyone that buys this copy of the book. If you would like a true copy of this book, go to your search eng. and type in The Book of Jasher. Find where it's written, there will be 91 chapters. You will have to download 10 chapters at a time but you get the whole Book that way. After you download to words you can then print it out, takes a lot of ink & paper but worth it. I bought this book and was very sorry I did."
2,Not what I expected,Thought it would have different songs. Did not realize it was all of the same musical. Did have big notes
4,An Ambitious Story!,"Okay, so this time I was up until 2:45 a.m. trying to finish! Overall, I thought the book was pretty good. Somebody in another review said they figured out halfway through the story who had the baby and by whom. I guess I'm a little dense cause I didn't know until the very end! LOL Anyway, I thought it was a nice, entertaining fast read. However, I was a little disappointed that Meredith didn't get more of a comeuppance. And the character Devin just kind of fizzled away. His character had the potential to become a very dangerous one, one that could have impacted other characters lives more and would have added a little more spice. What would have been a nice twist was to find out that Devin was the one who had fathered the baby! Now that would have been interesting. LOL! However, this book has made me want to check out her other novels and I would recommend it to friends and family to read."
4,"Good quick read, too quick, check it out of the library","This book was pretty good but it wsn't as good as Lolita's two previous books. The ending was wrapped up a little too neatly and the characters weren't fleshed out enough for my tastes.I checked this book out of the library. I bought her first two books and I'm not trying to ""playa hate"" but if I would've spent 20 dollars on this book I would've been upset.I waiting on the third installment (book) of my girls from the first two books, myself."
5,Back and Better Than Ever,"Files' new book is a sure thing. This book gives you a look into Hollywood from the black side, but that doesn't mean it's just a black book. Blind Ambitions has something for everybody, and all the characters were fun to examine. This was a very entertaining book with universal themes. I highly recommend it to all."
5,OUTSTANDING!,I loved Blind Ambitions. It was a real page-turner until the very end. Lolita Files continues to prove that she has what it takes as a writer. I have her other two books and I loved them. I can't wait to see what she comes up with next.
3,Great story about survival,"Although I found the story interesting and somewhat true-to-life. I did have one problem with the prologe, the mid-louges. To me, they didn't blend to what was going on in the main story."
2,Maybe it was just me,"I was rather disppointed with this book. I loved Scenes from A Sistah and Getting to the Ggood Part but it seems as if this book was hastily written. Whereas I felt that I knew Misty and Reesy, the characters in Blind Ambitions had little to no depth and it seemed as if whole parts of the story were missing. The ending of this book was a letdown also. Maybe I expected too much from Ms. Files but I was sorely disappointed by this novel."
2,Lacking Plot and Characterization,"This book was clearly lacking! Where is the plot? Where is the character development? Where is the intrugue? Where is the unexpected twist? Why was everything so predictable? As another reviewer said, what has been written is just an outline for a novel. A very good book could have been delivered, but what we got was air.I was relieved that Ms. Files wrote this book without the rawness of her first two novels. For that she gets the two stars. However, she needs to refine her writing skills to produce good, solid, memorable storylines and characters. ""Blind Ambitions"" missed the mark.Ms. Files has the potential to transition to a good novelst. She is not there yet. The standards for African-American authors is being raised higher and higher everyday as new writers enter the playing field. I trust that Ms. Files learns from this book and moves forward."
2,Where's the Beef?,This book was a well written outline. It had very little substance to it. I did not feel anything for the characters. I don't understand what others thought was so great it. The book started off great but went down hill from there. I kept reading thinking it has got to get better but I was left disappointed.I was left with the feeling that she was under a time constraint because the potential for a great book is there. Yet that is all there is - potential. It does not deliver.
2,Not So Hot,Although it wasn't a bad story line. This book proved to be a little to Hollywood for my taste. If your into the whole actor/producer scene then your bound to love this book. I on the other hand thought it was a little to drawn out.
3,I Would Recommend This Book!!!!!!,"I enjoyed this book and would recommend it. I enjoyed ""Getting To The Good Part"" much more though. ""Blind Ambition"" was written well and it provide a new twist. I look forward to her next book.Rhonda Gibson, Founder, First Annual African American Book Clubs & Readers Retreat, 13-15 Oct, 2000, Cherry Hill Hilton, Cherry Hill, New Jersey"
4,Just a little Peek,"Have you ever wondered what its like to live in Hollywood, be a part of the Hollywood scene. Lolita Files lets one have a little peek of the action. We get to follow Desi, Bettina, and Sharon,stuggling AA females in a city and working in an industry that does not encourage them to succeed, for 5 days. That's right 5 days. You know how you have those weeks when it seems a lot longer, these 5 days seems that way. Desi is a struggling actress and has to make some major decisions about her career. Sharon is a struggling producer who needs to make some decisons about her personal life and Bettina finds that her way of attaining success is not working and makes some changes in her life. There are ups and downs.While probably not the author's intent to make her a main character I have to mention Meredith. Her antics and storyline are very strong for a secondary character. Is she the villian or a victim?You will enjoy reading this well written book sneaking a peek at the rich and famous."
3,Simple but Enjoyable,"Blind Ambitions is about several people trying to make it big in the world of entertainment for writers, actors and execs. The book reminded me of a ""Dancing In September"" (feature film by Reggie Rock Blythewood) in how television shows are made and the struggles of all involved.Lolita Files is a fantastic writer and I enjoy her use of prose and her lyrical writing style.I gave a lukewarm rating because I thought the story line was extremely simplistic. I like a lot more meat and thought provoking material as in her book Child of God. While I thought the story was complete and vivid I found most of the character's actions and behavior to be predictable. Everything worked out for everyone in the end and that was cute. But I was disappointed that the novel's description on the back cover was misleading and somewhat unfulfilled.I however, would recommend this along with all of Ms. Files' other novels as well."
3,Entertaining but contrived!,"I made the mistake of reading ""Child of God"" first which was totally off the hook. I then read Files' other three books in publication order. In all fairness to Files, I used ""Child of God"" as the standard, and though ""Blind Ambitions"" was entertaining it does not even compare. The plot and character development was very thin and amateurish. Files' attempt at a twist (with the prologues and midlouges) was confusing at best."
4,captivating story line,"I really enjoyed this book and if you've read her other books, you'll also enjoy it. The characters are good and bad, funny, deceiptful, sleezey, desperate and power-hungry. The story line was great and it gave the book great potential. The reason I only gave this four stars however, is because the ending was anti-climatic and rushed. The next thing you know, is that two years have gone by and you only get to hear about what has happened and not see how it actually happened. Other than that, go and buy this. Now."
2,NOT A GOOD READ,"I did not enjoy this book. I LOVE the other two books from Lolita but I thought this one was way to intense when it came to show business terminology. When I read fiction, I am looking for a good story and SOME detail but not a term paper on a particular subject, which is what I felt this was... I think fiction should be enjoyable and full surprises and suspense not an in depth study of any type of information...."
1,Too Slow!,"This book is very slow. I was not able to complete it. It describes everything with too much detail. I was half way through the book and I had not reached a climax, or it got lost in all of the description. The characters were not interesting, I just did not like this book.--"
2,A Light Easy Quick Read .... 2.5 Stars @ the most,"I've read the reviews and I'm trying to understand something -- what am I missing? Am I expecting too much? I love my authors and will continue to support -- but at what price? Like most people who've read the book, it IS a quick read -- I finished it in two days. Actually this is the 1st book by Ms. Files that I've been able to finish. Would I recommend purchasing the hardback? No. I would encourage people to either check it out of the Library or wait for the paperback version.Without giving away the story for those who haven't read it yet -- I didn't know what to think after I was finished. There were things that she dropped without explanation. Too many open issues. The ending was forced and hurried up. I was just plain confused about the book in the end.Can someone help me understand?"
4,Amazing,I am amazed at how Lolita Files puts a story together and how she makes her characters so believable. I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading the next one and the next one and the next one.
2,Save Your Time and Money!,"If you're a fan of Lolita Files based on the first two novels she wrote, then don't attempt to read this one.I was very disappointed. This book,in no way, compares to Scenes From a Sistah and Getting to the Good Part.The book lacks excitement and the ""sistah"" type flavor the previous two books seem to explode with.My reading partner and I ran to the bookstore to purchase the book and we were both disappointed in this book.Lolita, if you read this,""PLEASE REVIVE THE SISTAH TYPE WRITING"". This book was a difficult read because it was so boring and way too slow for me.If you're a fan-""save your money and wait for Ms. Files to write a new one 'cause this one isn't worth your time or your money""."
5,Wish I Could Give More Than Five,"I love the way Lolita Files writes her novels. I really enjoyed the first two and recommended them to everyone. I just knew this one would not let me down. From the begining to end I just fell in love with all the characters, Sharon was my favorite though. My only problem was that it was so short, but unlike some other authors she closed off the book very well, you got to see what happened to all the characters and was not left hanging. If you want a really good and quick read, pick this up."
1,Design Flaw,"The heater worked fine for a couple of years, then the power switch melted. I replaced the power switch with one having a higher current rating (30A vice 20A) and after a few weeks the unit began to emit a burning electrical smell. I disassembled it and found the Diode Assembly MELTED! A search on the net revealed that this is a common problem. Fahrenheat knows about the problem and even has a repair kit (DB Kit) for $36. The diode alone cost $10, plus $10 shipping. This is a $3 part if you know the specs.If you buy one of these be aware of the potential DANGEROUS failures. I don't know how UL ever passed this product. It could be a fire hazard. If you don't believe me GOOGLE ""Fahrenheat LFP6152 Diode."" The fact that Fahrenheat knows about this problem to the point of developing an overpriced repair kit, and doesn't make it right, is inexcusable. I'll never buy another Fahrenheat product."
3,Nice quiet heater,We bought this heater to use at night in our bedroom so we didn't have to heat the whole house. It worked great for three and 1/2 years and then one night I smelled an odd plastic burning smell coming from the control on the side. I called the company and there is a fix they can send. It costs around $32-35 bucks which I wasn't happy with. I was so irritated that I bought a different heater that is more of a box style. I can't stand that one. It is sooo noisy I can't hear anything going on in the house. I am actually calling today to get the replacement part for the Farenheat. Just wish they would have covered the repair since judging from the internet posts it is a prevalent problem with this type.It gets the room warm all over instead of spotty warmth like the box style one did. I would recommend the newest model of the Farenheat because they probably fixed the bug I wrote earlier about.
1,Where's The Heat?,I am not sure how so many people gave this unit such high marks. I left the unit on high for almost 2 hours and it didn't heat the room at all. You could barely feel heat standing right in front of it. I put on an oscillating low output heating coil unit and it out did this unit and actually raised the temperature of the room.Very disappointed. It goes to show reviews are a great tool but you really need to try something yourself.
4,Toasty,"I love this heater!I have tried to replace a ventless stove (fumes-yuk!)with all manner of heaters unsuccessfully. None seemed able to keep my lower level kitchen (with ceramic floors & lots of windows)very warm in a 12'x20' area. So far, this has far exceeded my expectations, and I haven't even operated it above 2! I am considering replacing my existing base board with hard-wired units in the future. This was $ well spent."
1,no heat,"The unit itself gets very hot, but you can only feel the heat if you are right next to it. The room still remains very cold. No effective supplemental heat at all."
3,Good idea - needs improvements,"I bought these for my shih tzu. I got them so I could take him outside when the ground was wet to keep his paws from getting cold and wet. They're fairly easy to put on. I have to make him sit still for a while. They're not very convenient in that aspect. Also, they fall off of his feet very easily. Something needs to be improved to keep them from falling off so easily and to make it easier to put them on. Overall, it's a good idea; it just needs a little more work."
4,Mixed up,"The cd arrived and all appeared as it should. Then I played the cd and it was not Terry Evans. Apparently a mix up at the factory in the labeling department as the cd was labeled as Terry Evans, and the case had the insert for Terry Evans, but the cd was in fact someone else. I have never encountered this before.I contacted Amazon and a new cd was sent to me free of charge, but I did have to pay an additional amount of approx. $4 because of charging me and then refunding the amount which turned out to be different. I'm not sure why....Apart from paying an extra $4 for a mistake which was not mine I am satisfied."
1,Not enough updates,"If you already own the original Scrapbook (which is a great read, no arguing there), don't bother buying this ""revised and updated"" version. The only ""revised and updated"" things in the book are a new chapter added to the end of the book that summarizes her projects over the past few years and a new cover . The first chapter of the book still states she is single...it has not been updated to reflect her marriage to James Brolin. Also, her discography in the book has not been updated to include her past several albums. This is just a few examples of the examples why this ""updated"" version is disapointing and not needed in your book shelf. Wait for a real updated version, I have no doubt that the author will update it again, as it seems to be a great and cheap way to earn extra money."
5,Best version of the Rachmaninov,"I have several other recordings of the Rachmaninov Sonata for Cello and Piano. This is the best. The two artists are in complete sync, and the interpretation and recording are excellent. A must-buy for fans of romantic chamber music. As near to a symphony for cello and piano as you can get."
3,ok tea,This tea smells great - I love Rooibos teas -- I love the smell of cinnamon -- I brewed up a cup and the cinnamon is overwhelming --and there isn't any other chai spices in it like cardamon allspice cloves anise star - you don't taste the Rooibos at all - I am finding that flavoring in teas is bad -- you have to have the right taste or it will ruin it -- I will probally won't buy again --
3,Not Goddard's Best,"Robert Goddard remains my favorite modern author, and I'll continue to add his novels to my collection. But ""Play to the End"" will not be my favorite.Hard to say why, but I think it has to do with style and choice of setting. The story's hero, Toby Flood, is an actor - and the shallow, insincere world of the theater is well portrayed. The result is that I had a hard time identifying with the hero - something that was not at all difficult in any of the other Goddard novels I've read.As for style, it seemed to me to be somewhat staccato, again different from Goddard's usual. Almost as if he was emulating some writer of pulp detective fiction from the 1920s Chicago."
3,"Driven, But Two-Dimensional","I'm a fan of Robert Goddard and have read most of his novels. Some I like more than others. This one, I felt, was one of the weakest. Toby Flood, the hero, is a man driven to help his about-to-be-ex wife because he still loves her. She is about to marry somebody else. But something is wrong, and she asks for Toby's help. The plot escalates from there. I felt most of the characters were two-dimensional, and I just didn't find the story that gripping."
3,Simply not as good as the first,"There are plenty of good detailed reviews so I'll post a short one. Like the movie, this soundtrack was simply not as good as the first one, although the inclusion of the score is plus. Whereas the first soundtrack could be listened to as an album (much more than a soundtrack), I'd say that this cannot. I know that maybe it's a bit unfair to compare to the first soundtrack because it was so good, I doubt I'll be listening to this one nearly as much, and I guess that's the true sign of whether an album is good or not. I almost enjoyed the score on the second disc more than the songs on the first disc."
2,strictly for hardcore fans only,"with all the hype over reloaded and the how much a good deal it was to get the soundtrack with all the goodies in it, it was pretty disappointing save for a few songs... and the free sticker that came with it.however, it really depends on your taste in music too. if you're into all those techno stuff and Rob Dougan-ish tracks.. then get it. if you're not. stick with the first matrix soundtrack instead."
3,AMAZING SCORE; THE REST IS PRETTY MEDIOCRE,"THE SCORE PIECES, MOSTLY ON CD 2, ARE REALLY IMPRESSIVE, VERY 'MATRIX' STUFF.THE HIP HOP AND HEAVY SONGS THAT COME IN CD ONE ARE REAL MEDIOCRE STUFF. NOTHING NEW, EITHER TOO AGRESSIVE OR TOO MONOTONOUS. CONCLUSION, I THINK THE SCORE IS WORTH THE PRICE.... JUST THROW CD ONE AWAY."
3,Ok buttttt...,If you want a good combination soundtrack of hard rock/techno or whatever get the Spawn soundtrack. Easily the best compilation of artists out there. Just awesome!
5,the best soundtrack this year,"This soundtrack delivers a thrill ride of rock, metal, industrial, and electronica. Featuring new music from Marilyn Manson, Linkin Park, Rob D, Rob Zombie, Dave Matthews Band, Paul Oakenfeld, Fluke, simply amazing!"
3,"Not the good, not the bad and not the ugly","In discI; the good songs are marily manson, oakenfold. they are beating. linking park, pod and r.a.t.m are not bad. i got a very dissapointment about Rob Zombie. That's why i cut 1 star. Other Rob who is Dougan is much good that my Rob.In this II tracks 5, 6 and 7 are very good but too long. can you ever heard a soundtrack song that which is 17 min. long. but it was very good.other songs arte make me sooo bored even deftones. that's why i cut the other star.Deftones were just good in; escape from L.A and The Crow City of Angels."
2,pretty ho-hum,"Some interesting tech beats here and there, though largely muddled and tired. Worse still, there is just over 1 CD worth of content, stretched to two, and thats including the largely lame matrix reloaded score pieces. On the whole only 3 or 4 tracks worth listening to, definately not worth the purchase price. The original Matrix soundtrack rocked, and pushed the edge of music into interesting technological ground. This simply rehashes that idea, largely failing, and failing too to acctually fill the space they tout. Dissapointing."
3,The Matrix Reloaded OST Review,"I just got the OST today, and I have to say I'm a bit disappointed by it. The first CD is mostly nu-metal(The second disc is the score)that all sounds the same. The best songs on the 1st CD are: 1. Linkin Park: Session,12. Dave Matthews Band: When the World Ends, and 9.Rage Against the Machine: Calm Like a Bomb. The 2nd Cd is where the OST really shines with a great drumming piece(.04), and the Burly Brawl(.06). Overall this is a worthy purchase if only for the score."
3,At least the movie is cool,"For someone like me who isn't a metal fan, it was a huge disappointment to see that in order to get the awesome score from the movie, I'd have to also purchase a CD containing the likes of Marilyn Manson. On the other hand, I'm sure there are fans out there who only wanted the rock, not the score. Not my idea of good marketing. It would have been better if the two had been seperate, a la original Matrix, so fans could seperate out or buy both. But since that's not an option, I recommend buying this set and giving the less preferred CD to someone who would appreciate it more."
5,Exceeded my Expectations - This album RAWKS!,"Very good idea to put both the 'pop' and 'orchestral' music for The Matrix: Reloaded onto one disc.I personally prefer the 2nd disc [The orchestral] as the main themes are there [enhanced] plus new ones, which sound positively earth shattered.I of course love the P.O.D. song 'Sleeping Awake'. It's a great tune and will stick in my mind for a long time to come.This album has further whetted my appetite to see the movie.ALL HAIL THE MATRIX RELOADED!"
2,Matrix is for everyone,"i like the matrix because it reminds me of christmas time when all my family would come up to our house in the mountains and we would have Christmas and open our presents in a cave not far from our house. Christmas is a time of giving, it's best to give presents like beach balls and cars, not scary guns like in the movie...my dad likes to eat cake on christmas..mom would make breakfast the night before so we wouldn't have to work on christmas time..bears aren't really scary, they only have big teeth for catching fisheys' in the spring..."
2,The Matrix Mishap Soundtrack,"As a DJ and a huge fan of electronica and dance/house music I was quite dissapointed with this soundtrack. In a four word description of this cd I would say ""MORE OF THE SAME"". Nothing new on this cd that has not already been done in this genre- even if you are fanatic matrix fan....if you want to be impressed simply purchase the 1ST Matrix Original Motion Picture Soundtrack on Amazon.com for less $ than Reloaded-you will not be dissapointed!"
2,Not enough beats,"Sorry to say but what ruins this whole soundtrack is the distasteful mix of rock and techno. Either make it all rock or all techno. Personally I wish i could have made this soundtrack with nothing but futuristic beats ranging from idm/electro/breakbeat and dark drum n bass. Would they really listen to rock hundreds of years from now ? I think not . What this cd needs is a makeover with such bands as ( Chemical Bros,Electric Skychurch,Laurent Garnier,Layo & Bushwacka, Aphex Twin, Amon Tobin, Squarepusher,)EIB( aka Bad Company, Stakka and Skynet , Black Sun Empire, Dom and Roland, Cause 4 Concern ,Ram Trilogy). But hey apart from the above average tracks of Paul Oakenfolds- Dread Rock and Flukes- Zion the future seems to be full of mainstream excrement."
4,Rob Dougan/Chateau rocks!!!,"Worth buying mainly because it re-introduced me to Rob Dougan.His Clubbed to Death (as rob d) was a fav of mine from the original Matrix Soundtrack.After hearing Furious Angels and Chateau on Reloaded, I found his album on Amazon which is like the Matrix soundtrack but times 10.Spec because it has the track from the trailer too!!!"
2,Soundtrack?,"I've read plenty of reviews, and people have their favourite songs, and least favourite songs, and everyone has an opinion about this soundtrack. But, this is far from a soundrack. It's the record company squeezing a couple bucks out of ""The Matrix"" name, and putting out a sampler basically. Half of the tracks are available on the artists albums, and the rest is tailored specifically to the film. Just like the soundtrack to the first film that everyone seems to rant and rave about. Sure some of the songs are good, but some of them have been around long before ""The Matrix"" franchise. Nothing new here folks. Lets not think too hard about this one with 3,000 word reviews and how you like this song and don't like this one. Go review a real album. (However, kudo's to the record company for putting the soundtrack and the score on a double cd instead of charging the same price for two seperate albums.)"
3,"Not the good, not the bad and not the ugly","In discI; the good songs are marily manson, oakenfold. they are beating. linking park, pod and r.a.t.m are not bad. i got a very dissapointment about Rob Zombie. That's why i cut 1 star. Other Rob who is Dougan is much good that my Rob.In this II tracks 5, 6 and 7 are very good but too long. can you ever heard a soundtrack song that which is 17 min. long. but it was very good.other songs arte make me sooo bored even deftones. that's why i cut the other star.Deftones was good in; Matrix, escape from L.A and The Crow City of Angels."
3,C'mon Dougan - I'm Clubbed to Death already,"If I had never heard the soundtrack from the first Matrix album, I'd probably flip over this one. But after hearing half a dozen derivations of Clubbed to Death on one album, it gets a bit tired. Overall, the album's not bad - Linkin' Park sizzles with ""Session"" and PVD is always a treat."
1,What...is this?!?!?!,"How could anyone enjoy this cd? When I first heard this cd, I was like. Who would like this? Each song is over remixed and doesn't do any justice to the original cut. And I don't see how P.O.D.'s ""Sleeping Awake"" fits into this overkilled over technoed over hiped [CD] they call a soundtrack.What is Dave Matthews band getting remixed by Paul Oakenfold for? It's just absurd! If the movie was this [bad] I would have walked out. I guess its my mistake to listen to all the hipe and buy the cd before listening to it."
5,A Music Lover,"I really liked this soundtrack!I usually don't like soundtracks because they're usually old music in a new cover, but the Matrix Reloaded Album was a nice mix of techno, rock, and classical in a nice (and economic) package. I would have to say I liked almost every track. I also liked the way that the score was incorporated into the album. The selections were superb and the layout made the listening experience even more enjoyable.Also,The Enhanced CD was one of the best I have ever seen, rivaling many DVD's.I suggest this album to anyone who enjoys rock, techno, or classical music. You may find yourself breaking the ice into other genres.And once again...THE MATRIX HAS YOU"
3,A Little Boring... But ok. A 3.5 if I could,"CD 1: Its just that. boring. The Deftones song unbelievably boring. And I mean what in the world is the Dave Mathews Band doing on here! the only good songs are SESSION, CALM LIKE A BOMB, and SLEEPING AWAY and ZION are ok. Im not a Rob Zombie fan by any means but his song on the last one was alright but this one wasnt that great. And its the same deal with M M and I am DEFINATLY not a M M fan. Furiouse Angels is ok - its like a second Clubed To Death from the previous movie.CD 2: Main Title is almost exacly the same as the previous movie. CHATEAU is pretty up-beat and cool. But I think J. REACTOR VS. D. DAVIS is the best off this second disc beacause its the most up-beat. Its the one from the scene where Neo is fighting all the clone agents in the movie.OVERALL: I think its an alright cd but the first one was better. But this includes the artists cd and the movie score cd wich is Tight. So if i could I would kick it up a noch to a ***3.5***"
3,Reloaded or Recycled,"unless you have a vivid memory and can picture the movie in your head most of the songs on disc two are useless there are a few exceptions on disc one though:1. Deftones the best track on the two dics2. Dave Matthews Band (Oakenfold Mix) a nice treat3. Marilyn Manson nobody's stranger nobody's more fitted for the soundtrackand that's about it lack luster tracks form Rage Against the Machine,P.O.D,Linkin Park and Rob Zombie with obscure tecno tracks make disc one"
2,not impressive at all,"gave it two stars only because i'm a matrix fan myself and that the inclusion of oakenfold's dread rock tempts trance/techno listeners like me to buy the cd.linkin park's session is very similar to their previous work - nothing new about it. only oakenfold's remix makes it worth listening to the dave matthews band's song.the soundtrack could've been a lot better with stuff from people like paul van dyk, more oakenfold, victor calderone or even darude!"
3,a little disappointed,"I listened to the whole soundtrack looking for the ""rave dance"" scene in the movie @ Zion and was disappointed when it didn't appear building exactly like it did in the movie. I thought it was a nice mix of paganistic and modern dance music in the movie, but on the score it's just another song."
4,Reloaded!!!!,"This is a dual CD collection of soundtracks from the credits. The first CD has music from bands that can be heard at the end in the credits. While the 2nd Cd my favorite has music from the background music true soundtrack music. The second CD also features rom for your computer, like a preview of the Animatrix (Last Flight of th Osris (my personal favorite)), an early tralier of matrix revolutions.There are really no major flaws.... really how can you mess up a music CD (well....its been done, look at Creed). Any who I really hated the first CD for the Gothic/ Punk/ Stupid beat music. The features are nothing new since its al out.I really like the 2nd CD because of the Soundtracks, really entertaining. The CD rom stuff really is cool, and a good background music to work to. Only thing holding this thing from a 5 is the first CD. So a 4/5."
4,The sound of the future,"The Matrix Reloaded SoundtrackI expected a little more from the soundtrack, but as a great fan of the Matrix trilogy I also loved the soundtrack. It's probably most of the fans opinion that the second CD from the album is a lot better than the first one. I just think that way because the second CD is the real soundtrack from the movie. Therefore it contains the songs played in the movie.Not that the first CD is bad, or anything like that. If you like Linkin Park's style you will probably like the CD because it is basically that style, but it doesn't have much to do much with the movie. I just think that it is not the kind of CD I would buy. But the second is worth the entire price of it, it simply made me ruffle. Oh, and there is a little surprise in it too. Put it in the computer and you'll have access to the backstage of the Enter the Matrix game, and some previews from the movie and the Animatrix."
3,not bad,there are only a couple of songs i like on here. one os a rage classic and theres a good techno song too. the rest is classic stuff.
2,Not As Good As I Expected It To Be...,"I expected this soundtrack to really be something special. I was wrong, though. Half of the tracks on disc one are instrumental and the only good songs on it are ""Reload"", ""This Is The New Sh*t"", and ""Lucky You"". Disc two consists of only instrumental songs featured in the film. It is very boring."
1,No goooooood!!!!!!,"this cd really sucks, i havent even heard it. but there is a good reason for that, and i think you all know why. my first problem with this cd is; its a soundtrack... who the hell buys a soundtrack. what are you? some kind of jerk? second of all; the only song even worth hearing on this cd is sleeping awake by POD... and just buy their cd. what is wrong with you... you're looking at reviews to buy a soundtrack album... what are you thinking? serioulsy... you know this cd isn't cool. i dont care how many of your little sisters friends like the new matrix video... if your even considering paying money it should be only so that you can buy it, and then throw it in the garbage on your way out, and everyone will be like ""he just bought for that!"" but it will be funny, because it sucks so much. its ugly. case closed about...3....2...1....LOSER!!!!"
3,why?,I am still wondering linkin Park and POD. two bands that represent the downfall of music as we know it are on the same disk as Rob Zombie or even more sacroligious; Rage Against the Machine??! Buy the first one and download the poo out of this one.
4,Great music to go with a great movie!,Most of the songs on this CD are great. I think you cuold divide them into 3 kinds of music:Heave metal (like the screaming rock stuff)TechnoClassic (in which the scores are put in)Great music to go with a great MOVIE! Check it out!
5,AWESOME.,The Matrix Reloaded is going to be Awesome. The Soundtrack is awesome. THE MATRIX IS AWESOME.
2,"Somewhat funny, but doesn't cut it.","Getting In is an... interesting film, but after a while it becomes a dismal bore. Some parts of the film are funny, but usually it is pretty lame, and doesn't REALLY make the murderer a mystery. In ""Getting In"", Medical Students are mysteriously killed after being bribed off of the waiting list into Johns Hopkins Medical School. It's a little humorous and interesting at times, but other than that, it's a bore. And DON'T let the photos of Calista Flockhart and Matthew Perry on the cover of the film's recent re-release fool you... they have a total of 6 minutes airtime together, and I am not kidding."
3,Darkly Humorous,"It is light unambitious film that tickles the funny bone a fair bit with ghoulish jokes about killing people with style. This is not a bad film but it never reaches the true tongue-in-cheek styles of ""How I Got Into College"" or the morbid grace of ""Heathers"". Somewhere it falls short and in this kind of picture that means the script. The dialogue is not snappy enough and you kind of wish the psychopath would kill the pathetic hero of the picture. But there are a few chuckles that beat other 3 a.m. cable fare. The acting is not bad but I don't get the feeling it was suppose to be great either. The comedy arrangement is one innocent man, one deranged psychopath, one pretty co-ed, and a Med-School Wait List. So if you don't mind guessing the end at the beginning and never being truly surprised then this picture can give you some interesting laughs."
4,STEPHEN MAILER IS AWESOME,Anything with Stephen Mailer is good. It is such a shame that the main actor is the movie is kicked off the new cover. Calista and Matthew have 2-minute roles and get top billing!
4,Interesting...,"Conisdering Elisabeth MacDonald is my grandmother, all of her books have been on our shelves for years. I never had the urge to read any of them. Mostly because she is my grandmother and reading a romantic novel she wrote would be weird, and also because I do not share the same mormon faith. But I finally picked this one up and though ""what the heck. I'll just read it."" and I was pleasantly suprised. It was pretty good. It was a bit tough for me to get through some of the more provocative parts, but I was impressed by what my grandma could do with words."
1,Don't spend your money!!!!,"I bought this MP3 player mainly on price. The old saying, ""you get what you pay for"" is true in this case. The controls are cheaply made and very difficult to navigate. There is a ""mode"" button on the side that you use to scroll through the functions.It sticks constantly making it hard to go to different areas. You're better off spending a little more for a good brand like Sandisk. I sent this back and got a Sandisk."
3,Good,"I don't understand why you sent me this items with a difference of weight, so I had to pay more that I expected."
2,Not enough supplies to complete the project,"My family of five sat down with this kit for a fun afternoon of candle-making. We were very disappointed to discover that, despite the package's claim of ""everything you need to make eight nights of lights,"" there was only enough string to make wicks for about 12 candles! (You need 44 candles for all 8 nights of Hanukkah.) My three children (ages 4,6,and 8) and my husband and I were really looking forward to this activity. Because of the lack of adequate supplies, as well as the brittleness of the wax, it turned out to be a huge waste of money and expectations. Until the company fixes the supply problem, I would not recommend this product. Good potential, so that's why I gave it 2 stars and not 1."
3,Light for One Night,"As others have noted, the kit is sorely lacking in supplies. However, if you accept that you will not be able to make all the candles you need, it can be a special family project. How about one night of candles, or a shamash for every night? Maybe make one for each far-away relative?The beeswax does burn rapidly, so another possibility is cutting designs/helping the kids cut designs out of the beeswax, and then sticking them the conventional candles (the warmmth of you hands should be encough to help them stick.)"
2,Not enough supplies,"This is a charming idea and is a great project to do with kids (you do have to take care with the beeswax and soften it between your hands before you roll the candles). I did it at school with my daughter's 2nd grade class but was so disappointed to find that there was not nearly enough wick to make 44 candles! For nearly 20 dollars this was a serious shortcoming, as the labeling says in several places it has ""everything you need!"""
2,Good book but horrible craft,The book had interesting information but the wax was brittle and there was not nearly enough wick material to make 44 candles my children almost 5 and 3 were incredibly disappointed as was I - be sure to buy candles from elsewhere because these are miserable!
2,not as advertised,"the picture shows lights for a 6 armed umbrella. thats what i wanted. i got an 8 armed light set. I could have bought the 8 arm set all over town, saving $5.00 on shipping. they should change the picture."
1,Deceptive listing,These are Target Home Brand Umbrella Lights - 72 Count and are avaiable from Target for $14.99. The listing doesn't state that anywhere...pretty deceptive selling practice.
4,Still Chilling,"Gabrielle and The Mirrors are one of my favorites,I use there music while I do Massage Thearpy on some of my clients..Its relaxing,erotic,never boring.. and ""Still Chilling"" is a very good cd BUY IT!!!!"
2,unconvinced,"There are some compelling moments in this film, but too many false ones. We're asked to suspend disbelief in a street-tough (but thumb-sucking) 14 year-old girl from the Northwest with an Elvis fixation (this is in the late 1970's) and a Brooklyn accent (huh?). At the end, without any prior hint of hostility towards her father, she is depicted killing him in a remarkably dispassionate manner while taunting him sexually. She then blows up herself and her mother (apparently the original script just had her killing the father, but this wasn't lurid enough for Hopper, who threatened to quit if they didn't let him take the film over). I suppose I could buy the depiction if it worked dramatically, but I don't think it does. All of the actors have some excellent scenes (although Hopper's are often marred by his manic tendencies), but the film as a whole isn't convincing in my opinion."
3,"out of the blue, okay","i'm no film expert, but i found it an interesting film that, to me, went a little in the gratuitous shock direction at the end. still, there were some fine performances, not least from newcomer linda manz; as a character study, definitely worth a look."
5,Faeries,"I haven't had a chance to really look at the book in detail, but what I've managed to skim through I have enjoyed."
5,absolutely wonderful!!!,"This was the first book I got that was by Brian Froud, and honestly it was pure chance that I recieved this book. However, fate didn't dissapoint me with this one. This book is so informative, I just loved it, and still do. The pictures are fantastic and some beyond belief that they were created by mortal hands. If it were not for this book I probably would not have been taken in by the world of faerie but I'm glad I was."
5,Beautiful book,"I've always wanted this book, it`s a beautiful edition of a magical book. It`s great for kids and adults. It came in perfect conditions."
3,Same as it ever was with new forward...and that's it,"I was first introduced to ""Faeries"" when it was originally released in the late 70's. That copy (given by a favorite aunt) was well loved for many many years, using it even as a reference for university class...everything about the book is wonderful, possible and a true work of art...that was the original book and this edition is just like it with the exception of a new forward by Froud and Lee with new illustrations in their forwards. That's it. The remainder of the book is the same. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but feel one should know (especially if you are about to pay a nice chunk of change for this edition--2002--) you can be just as happy with ""Faeries"" as with this anniversary one. Very special either way, especially if you truly do believe..."
5,Magical,"When I was a girl I have seen three books; Dwarfes, Faires and Giants. I was enchanted. I didn't buy them then because they were very expensive, and later, I was trying to find all three, but I manage to find only two. Now I have kids of my own and my son, who is three and a half, is apsolutly crazy about Dwarfes and Faires. All I can say is that finding the third book is my wish, and since this became impossible it is a task I would like to fullfil. So, maybe some of you, booklovers can help me with information where I can find Giants made by Brian Fraud and Alan Lee, by Hari 'N Abrams, published by N.Y. Rufus publication back in 1978. All I can say about this books is that I was looking for them 22 years. Two I have found, one I still miss. If someone is trying to find this books for so long - now for kids of her own, should I add anything more?"
1,Faeries the deceptive book,"This particular book is highly reviewed by many people. It is a love/hate kind of book. Either you love the story and lore, or you hate the imagery. If you want a book with a light hearted story and fluffy lore with beautiful pixies/faeries; this is NOT the right book. The ads for this book deceptively illustrated a different set of contents. So please check the negitive reviews too!"
2,Not All That Great,"I was expecting beautiful pictures of flower fairies with gossamer wings and dresses of silk. What I found were ugly pictures of scary, hideous monster-like ""fairies."" What a disappointment!"
5,Faeries by Brian Froud,"""Faeries"" by Brian Froud - delightful, beautiful, grotesque, fanciful, etc. This is the second I have purchased. This book inspired both of my daughters in art class. This is the second I have purchased. Now each daughter owns a copy."
5,great pictures and stories,"Absolutely wonderful writing and incredible pictures. I like the format of this book in that its a mix of hand written pencil notes along with regular type font for the main text. The drwaings are fantastic - wonderful expressions, outfits, colors. There are legends and such to set the stage before talking about each of the different faeries and other characters. Each faery discussed has a page devoted with a short text and drawings. The writing enlightens the imagination."
2,Definitely Better Books on Product Management,This book has some decent discussion points but it really lacked overall depth on most of the subjects. You could tell which subjects the authors specialized in because those chapters where about three times as long as the others.
3,Inflict on your friends.,"I received this one for Christmas several years back. It went unopened until about a year ago, when my husband and I sat down to watch it. For anyone who isn't a child, this movie is going to be painful to watch. Painful enough, though, that it is redeemable for the humor of inflicting it upon friends.We've since shown Cutest Cat Capers to several of our buddies, all of whom have begged us to shut it off. Needless to say, we take an almost sadistic glee in not acceeding to their pleas.All in all, I'd say this video is excellent for small children who love cats, but the entertainment value for adults is virtually nonexistant - except perhaps laughing at the production values."
1,Boring.,"This video was not very interesting. Some scenes are repeated, some are even repeated in reverse."
1,Don't buy!,"I have this for my hermit crabs. The thermometer would never read over 68 degrees no matter what I did. I bought an extra heater and raised my house temp with no improvement. The tank felt warmer than my house temp so I bought a different thermometer. It registered 78 degrees on one side of the tank and 71 on the other! This thermometer is VERY inaccurate! Do not buy it! The hydrometer seems to work, but I'll be replacing that portion too just in case!"
1,Poor quality,Poor quality thermometer and humidity gauge. What do you expect for the price? I expect it to at least be close to accurate. I have a digital for about a dollar more that works great. This one is hard to see and inaccurate.
3,You get what you pay for,"These are inexpensive but work well -- for awhile anyway. This is the second one I have bought and each time one of the gauges quits working after a couple of months. Secures well to the glass, and the colors on the thermometer make it easy to read at a quick glance."
1,One of the worst text books I have ever used,"There are so many mistakes throughout the text. In addition to the mistakes, much of the explanations are unclear and confusing."
1,"if you get nothing else, you now own a $100 paper weight","Don't you just love the fact that you were probably forced to purchase a book which is heavy, incorrect, and not to mention dry? I mean, Physical Chemistry is not exactly a wear-on-your-sleeve subject, but entropy and enthalpy are relatively exciting topics. If you believe this, I have a prime piece of Florida Swampland for sale. Ideal for building!"
2,looking for a decent physical chemistry book?,"Hmmm... seems there are lots of people who don't like their phys chem book.The one you want is Physical Chemistry , 4/e by Laidler, Meiser, Sanctuary, ISBN 061815292X. It's the most student friendly text on the market.Description on their website says ""With its clear explanations and practical pedagogy, Physical Chemistry is less intimidating to students than other texts, without sacrificing the mathematical rigor and comprehensiveness necessary for a junior-level physical chemistry course. The text's long-standing reputation for accessible writing provides clear instruction and superior problem-solving support for students."" I second that.see my review herePhysical Chemistry. I mention the alternatives as well."
1,paper weight overweighes its value...,"THE worst book in this field! No structure, on pedagogy, too many typos, too many defects. If you have no tissue paper in the public W.C., then use this book with perfect pleasure. The only thing you can get from this book is the sympathy or relief that the author is also perplexed with the subject...not only me! I can control my temper with typos, but how he can have completely no structure or feeling on the subject!"
1,How is this still in print?,"Absolutely the worst text ever written. Period. My prof gives out 5 pages of typos written in 10 font for this text ... and those are just the ones she has found. I have wasted days trying to rectify typos with correct answers that I got for problems. The book has no teaching style whatsoever. I honestly cannot believe that it has not been revised, or burned en masse. If you have this text for your own PChem classes, invest in another one to supplement it. Otherwise, you're screwed ... plain and simple."
1,Physical Chemistry 2nd. Ed.,"After three undergraduate courses in Physical Chemistry, I am finnally confronted with the graduate studies and my first (and I hope last) PChem course, and the professor had the bright idea of using this...for a textbook for the course. Is the most terrible, non-didactic, boring, non-informative, anti-chemistry book I have ever seen in my life (and I have seen a lot). If by any chance, you are confronted with the requirement of using this waste of paper and ink as your mandatory textbook, do yourself a favor, pick some other to understand the subject for real, or drop the class and find a better course somewhere else."
5,"Excellent, everyone needs this book","This entire series is incredible. Everyone should be forcedby law to own them all. This one is 1st person narrative byVladimir Taltos, assassin/sorceror/Easterer in the DragaeranEmpire. This novel is set before the first one in the series,_Jhereg_, but you need to read _Jhereg_ to understand it.In this one Vlad meets, is killed by, and falls in love with hiswife, Cawti(yes it happens in that order), and takes on a Jhereg thatwants his territory. A conspiracy thats been going on for about 500 yearsis uncovered and Vlad is forced to stop it. Fast moving plot.Wonderful writing style and excellent characters."
3,The weakest in the series but a still enjoyable read,"The second novel in the Taltos-Dragaera series, _Yendi_ falls before _Jhereg_ and after _Taltos_ time-wise. It provides some interesting background on how the series' protagonist, Vlad, met his wife, and provides plenty of twists, turns and intrigue to go with it. However, I felt that of all the Taltos novels, this one was by far the weakest, with a forced plot, awkward dialogue and some truly silly things. This impression is heightened because the novels preceding (_Jhereg_) and following (_Teckla_) it are of much higher quality. On the other foot, Brust's worst is still a cut above most author's best. Definitely read it, but don't judge the series by it."
1,This is work an atrocity!!!!!!,"This work is an absolute atrocity and has no use other then fire starter... or for a good laugh!!These claimed erudites and doctors with there Phds etc. etc.Reveal that they know less than infants when it comes to a matter of true glory!!This book is the bashing of one of the greatest Spirits in history RICHARD WAGNER!!!!!!!!Why Bother writing a book just to insult someone???To all those involved in the creation of this work, my heart goes out to you, for you know not what you do. FOOLS!This book does not even deserve a rating.WAGNER IS A MASTER!!!!!"
2,No cinnamon,"I went out of my way to locate Stephen's Gourmet Cinnamon Hot Cocoa. I was very disappointed! The cocoa taste was weak and watery, even though I mixed it with milk. There was NO cinnamon taste to it at all. Very, very disappointed."
2,rechargable batteries that don't recharge well,"After first receiving the batteries I charged them all, only one of the six took the charge. After various attempts, I finally got 5 of the 6 to charge, but the sixth refuses. Makes you wonder if the vendor test their product before sell them."
1,Don't waste your money on this product - the Bluray is cheaper,"Soon, we'll be watching all of our operas in high definition. Hold off on purchasing the DVD of this performance. Wait until you have a Bluray player, and then buy the Bluray edition, which is cheaper and of much higher video/audio quality. As for the performance itself, you can read my review on the Bluray version's page."
4,"Bought it cause I thought it was funny, listen because it's good!!!","I originally bought this CD because I found it amusing that a hasidic jew was singing reggae. To me it was basically a novelty act. When I originally heard Matisyahu on the radio, I thought that it was some jamacain name or something. After a few listens to the CD, I realized how good it was. Matisyahu was better than a lot of the artists that fit the traditional reggae stereotype. True, his songs were filled with old testament propaganda that I don't totally agree with, but either way, you can't understand half the stuff he's saying anyway!!!"
3,hasidic reggae??,"hasidic jew singing reggae? turns out it's not all that unusual, it's been going on for a while and there are several good artists. matisyahu is at the forefront and one listen to his album and you'll know why. very capable band, beats and vocals makes the seeming contradiction all but fade after just a few listens -- as a matter of fact you're likely to see similarities between reggae and middle eastern music you never realized before. ""chop 'em down"" and ""king without a crown"" are uptempo highlights that draw you in and after a few listens you begin to appreciate nearly every track. this is worth a listen - especially if you're looking for something new - and future works offer even more potential."
3,"Good, but gets annoying the more you listen to it","When I first heard this guy I thought he really had something going so I bought the cd. I have had it for about a week now and I would have given it 4-stars but the guy has to stop using the yee-kee yo yee-kee yo or whatever. I read a review when I first bought the cd that said about the same thing, and I thought the reviewer was full of it. Now, I tend to agree. The more you listen to it the more it gets on your nerves. I mean there is no need for that extra noise he throws in there.He needs to stop saying this yee-kee yo phrase as I believe it will eventually hurt his sales."
2,ok reggae,"There is nothing bad here, but nothing that great either. There are a ton of great Jamaican artists doing what Matisyahu does but better. I was expecting more orginal works here. Maybe on the studio album."
2,Not what I expected - Whoa Religious!,"I heard this CD for the first time at a friends house and loved the beat. I love reggae! I was unable to listen to the words/meaning of the songs, while I was there. I just knew that it got my head bobbin. I bought the CD the next day, and was quite surprised when listening to the lyrics. I wasn't aware that I had bought such a religious CD. My friend had warned me that matisyahu was a jewish man with strong beliefs, but I wasn't expecting EVERY SINGLE song to be based on it. You definately have to be a religious person to enjoy this CD, otherwise, just don't buy it. I kind of feel out of place listening to it because I don't relate. If matisyahu used his beats for something other than preaching, I might purchase that CD. He does have talent, I just haven't been able to connect with the music."
1,*yawn*,"one of the worst imitations i've ever heard. this really is getting ridiculous. i had high hopes for this record, judging from the apparent 'spirityall' content and 'tight rhythm section'. the band was without the push and pull of a seasoned reggae riddim section, and no vibe. so i tried to appreciate it for what it was, not what it's been billed as. and what is was, incidently, was boring and repetitive. if you really need something to prove that 'white guys can play reggae', try gentleman. it blows this garbage away with the quickness. jah bless."
1,A gift that I am trying to keep on giving.,Save your money.End of story.I am unable to give this gift away.
5,Its cool and it grows with every listening,"An orthodox jew doing reggae?! That was such an odd combination that I just had to buy his two CDs. Believe it or not, but Matisyahu has created a really new and totally cool sound! The man combines real musical talent with a burning belief. He uses his music to express his own strong passion.This is art inspired by religion much in the same way as the Sistine Chapel is. The religiosity or religion of the listener is not that important.There are some songs that are not that good, but others, like Chop 'em down and Sea to sea are just great. He is still finding his way in the musical world, and some experiments are bound to fail (eg. Warrior and Beat box). I prefer this CD to Youth.He also sounds like a quite cool guy in interviews, and is not a fanatic in any way, which is a relief."
4,Refreshing Reggae,"Matisyahu's live CD is a refreshing addition to any reggae collection. Fun, uplifting spiritual message, and a superb human beat box. I love the Hasidic aspect, too.On the down side, Matisyahu's voice sometimes seems slightly off key (I think this will improve over time). Also, the guitar rocking gets slightly old, causing me to sometimes skip a few tracks.Still, this is a solid CD. A must for any reggae lover seeking new, fresh talent for their CD players.PS - Neat that Matisyahu is opening for Trey Anastasio a few dates this summer..."
5,"Great music, but the lyrics are insane!","Most of the reviews have focused on the music and the energy - both of which are big positives on this album. But has anyone stopped and listened to the lyrics? The words are powerful and uplifting- spiritual without being sappy, moralistic without being preachy. Most people don't know much about Chasicic Jews, but they are some of the happiest folks around - close knit families, love of community, love of god. They pray with enthusiasm, with energy and often dance the night away. I am not chasidic and never will be, but we could learn a bit from Matisyahu. This is not rap about drugs, bitches and killing cops. This is a whole other world. A better world."
5,Powerful,"A powerful album, with impassioned performances by Matisyahu and his band (some great guitar solos)"
5,good music,"it was a nice present for my family, they liked so much the music, smooth listening and a perfect gift"
3,mediocre at best!,"this guy wouldn't make it at all, if it wasnt for his band, he has potential, but he has to stop saying yugi yugi oh! snow did the same thing with "" lick ya boom boom now"" to keep the flow going with the music, matisyahu's beat boxing skills are decent but unorganized, and cant seem to keep a steady beat at it, all in all i found theirs only 4 tracks on the cd that i can stand listening to! and if you listen to the crowd, through out the cd, they sound pretty quiet through the majority of it."
5,Outstanding!,"This CD is a blast. I got it last week from my local Mediatheque and it has turned to be an awesome discovery. Actually, I am not too much into reggae nor I am a believer, but Matisyahu shows that you can funnel your spirituality and your religious zeal into something creative and beautiful, instead of into suicide bombings or smashing planes into skyscrappers. Two thumbs up!."
5,Wow!,"I absolutly loved this cd! It sounds so awesome even though it's live. Rufuge, sea by sea, king without a crown, and close my eyes were my favorites. I cannot wait to see him live. I have been listening to it in my car for like 2 weeks straight. I cannot get enough of it. I would definately recommend buying it!"
3,relaxingw/matisyahu,When i first heard the song king with out a crown i knew that i had to have this cd.But it can get kind of boring cause some of the songs sound the same and are about the same things.The biggest challenge for me is trying to pronounce the name. All in all it is a good cd.
3,Matisyahu,"So yes, he's a Hasidic Jew who makes reggae for the new century. But once you get past the novelty of it, the music is what must be judged.The music itself is good straight-ahead reggae. This may border more on dancehall with a little bit of hip-hop thrown in. It's not really slow, laid-back like the classic Bob Marley reggae.My main concern with the album is that it all starts to sound the same after awhile. Every song has the same tempo, nearly the same flow lyrically, and same instrumentals. The album lacks a whole lot of memorable choruses to make each song distinguishable from the next.Overall, it's decent reggae for the new century. I had a hard time getting through it all in one sitting though. Matisyahu shows some promise though for a debut album."
1,Are You Joking?,"First of all, anyone giving this a positive review is a straight up idiot. Seriously, you all have to be kidding yourselves. This is indeed a novelty act - and a bad one at that."
1,Worst imitation of reggae I have ever heard!!!,"This guy can't sing to save his soul and while the lyrics may be religious, it is hard to listen to his off beat, off tune offerings.He can't beat box, rap, or sing. If you need a coaster or paper weight, buy this cd cause this is no reggae sensation. ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!"
3,The Best Hasidic Jew Reggae Artist Ever,What else can I say? He's fairly unique and has made a quite entertainin little disc here. Seems more like one of those novelty bandwagons people jump on every now and then (remember Lou Bega?) - don't know if this will hold up at all....
2,"This one's all about Pletnev, not Scarlatti","If you like bizarre accents and distorted tempos to the point of recomposition--Pletnev's performance of K 404 is a perfect example--then you will love this album! Other works are fast, and that's all they are. K 113 is a case in point, played so quickly that one hears nothing of the dialogue of the hand-crossing.It's not all bad--sometimes Pletnev's technique can show a new dimension that works as music--K 214 is a good example. And Pletnev does offer a nice variety, divided about 50/50 between same ol' and less familiar sonatas.But I've listened to the album over 10 times and much of what struck me as new and exciting at first now just sounds weird and distorted. I recommend Ivo Pogorelich or Michael Lewin if you want to hear Scarlatti played well on piano."
2,Not for my taste,"I found these versions to be grossly distorted exaggerations of exceptional music. Pletnev, in my humble opinion, shows poor taste in over-interpreting Scarlatti.There are many splendid versions of this great composer's works to choose from on piano(i.e. Michelangeli, Pogerelich,di Bonaventura, Horowitz),or harpsichorcd (Hantai) which capture the beautiful simplicity of this music.Pletnev does not capture it for me."
4,"Have Guitar, Will Travel.","Jeff Turmes is a very gifted and talented musician.Unfortunately, for people not in the know, Jeff will only be 'a face in the crowd' and his name won't be indelibly etched in most people's memory bank.I find his music to be universal and his voice, although unique, still an acquired taste.This disc is ""hot"" and worthy of high ratings, but will not be everyone's ""cup of tea""."
5,"good plates, good price","These were just what I expected, and were the best price I could find-better than Sam's. they are sturdy and attractive."
5,Pleased!,Reasonable price for quality of product. Only one thing when plates had hot food on them they did crack in half.
5,Enlightening and moving film!,"I saw this film last night at a conference for autism and low incidence. I was not an attendee, but rather, a member of the video crew. I've worked live events for almost 25 years and not a single one has made such an impact on me as this one. I really knew nothing about what autism really is until I met Tracey and Larry along with their associates Harvey and Pascal. This film does a lot to show us what really is inside of these two men who are autistic. Tracey's intelligence and Larry's poetic phrasing amazed me. This is not a preachy film, this is a fantastic documentary that is worth viewing for it's film making alone."
4,OC informative book,"Organized Crime is a really informative book, it offers a lot of information about various criminal organizations..not just Italian Maffia, but Russian, Irish, Jewish. The information is great becaus it is expanding my knowledge base of criminal organizations and their capabilities."
3,A good overview but don't expect too much,"This book is obviously written by an expert, the relevance of the examples, the deep knowledge of financial institutions cultures, and some of the analysis is really outstanding and useful. If you have no clue of what managing a bank is, you have to read this book. The problem is that if you work regularly with banks, you will have to dig hard in ""bank management 101"", in other words, all the traditional management model (BPR, ABC - where Ms Mabberley is an expert, TQM, KAIZEN, ...) in another fashion ... Please, don't dilute quality in your next book, julie ! (I will buy it, but hope it adresses experienced people ...)"
4,"Out of One Eye, but visually entrancing","Though this work was published after his two previous popular books, ""Masquerade"" and ""Bee on the Comb"", it contains works done before. With a short biographical introduction it starts with his early artistic adventures then goes on to detailed, if eclectic, subjects, blending Realism with whimsy. The final pages showcase his ingenious and mechanically marvelous sculptures which are exquisitely painted, with detailed marquetry and metalwork. The printed page shows but a shadow of what these constructions must be like in 3D.If you like his other work, and you can find this one, buy it!"
5,A Phenonmenal Comeback. Bravo!,"Hands down, this album radiates excellence. Lake of Tears have long been a favourite of mine. And, like so many grief-stricken fans I was mortified to learn of their separation. However, LoT has returned with an album so utterly compelling that it will indeed summon tears to the eyes. Perhaps not a lake, but there you are.Black Brick Road is a lush soundscape, replete with gothic, melancholy vocals and high keening guitars. Standout tracks include the eerily thunderous 'The Greymen', the keening 'Making Evenings,' the masterful 'Rainy Day Away,' the haunting narrative 'A Trip With the Moon,' and finally the albums softly uttered centerpiece, the subtle and pervasive 'Black Brick Road.'If you care about consummate craftsmanship, if you thrill to deep, evocative lyrics, if you enjoy music that just kicks general gothic ass, you couldn't do better than 'Black Brick Road.' Quite simply a masterpiece. Oh, and it's good, too."
5,Excellent from beginning to end!,"As a longtime fan of Joe, I eagerly awaited the release of his new cd My Name is Joe, and he did not disappoint! Excellent cd that captures all the stages of a relationship: from catching a lover cheating on ""Stutter"", to the joy and exploration of new love on ""I Wanna Know"", to learning to appreciate love on ""Treat Her Like A Lady"". The big surprise on this cd for me was the duet with 'NSync. When I first saw their name on the cd I said ""WHAT! "" But I have to admit any skeptism or doubt I had was quickly erased when I heard the beautiful ""I Believe In You"". This pop group could not have picked a better collaborator or a better song to start fully exploring their R&B side. For the existing or new fan, ""My Name Is Joe"" is a must-have!"
5,Joe,"he is very sensitive guy and very romantic, i love his songs, they came from the heart. and all girls need a guy like JOE!"
3,"This Ain't No ""All That I Am""","I was really looking forward to this CD. I had even planned to get it for my mom for her birthday. Unfortunately, it is NOT as good as the last one. As always, Joe's voice sounds smooth. ""Treat Her Like A Lady"" is a wonderful song. The rest was so-so. Maybe this CD will grown on me...it's good enough to get a few more chances. But it's NOT one of those cd's you buy where you are like, ""I can't listen to ANYTHING else because this is the best thing I've heard in a long time."""
3,"Okay, But not ALL THAT I AM","I rushed out to buy this CD the first day that it came out because I am a HUGE fan of Joe and All That I Am is one of my all-time favorite CD's. I guess I was expecting a CD full of classic ballads like Good Girls, All That I Am, and No One Else Comes Close but I 'm sad to say that I was dissapointed. Not that this CD is bad...It's actually not bad to listen to but I feel like Joe tried too hard to get the recognition that he deserves by putting in too many beats and an appearance by N'Sync that true R&B fans could care less about. I know that Joe probably feels that he is not as famous as he should be but he should be true to himself and his music and superstardom will follow. The best tracks are Table For Two, 563 (Joe) and Treat her Like a Lady even though it's sounds surprisingly similar lyrically to The Love Scene."
1,VERY TYPICAL TODAYS R-N-B,Another facotry based Disc.I've heard Joe for a few Years&He still sounds Like a Low Budget 2nd tier R.Kelly.He Won't Ever Be On R'S Level Let a More Keith Sweat's.This Album's Music Could Easily Be on Anyones Disc that's out now.Very Predictable&Boring.Thank God Remix is Bad Bad.Keith Sweat's Make it Last Forever didn't Need a Weak Re-make.His Voice is Alright but the Material is so Bland as is the Song-writing.
4,You Wanna Know Joe!,"Joe's third album may be his most succesful and I might be going a bit overboard, but I think it's his best. I Wanna Know, the song currently heating up the charts has brought a lot of attention to this man. It is well deserved and if you love that song like I do then you will probally love this cd.Even though I have liked him for a while I think R. Kelly overshadowed him a bit(just an observation). But this cd seperates them by far now. Joe even colleberates with N'Sync, and not being a big fan of them, I kinda like this song.The standout's are: I wanna Know, Treat Her Like A Lady, One Life Stand, and the Remix to Thank God I Found You.I think Joe has another classic on his hands and I am happy to see him having even more success. If you like R&B and Keith Swaet and R. Kelly then you'll like this work, maybe even better. To all you current Joe fans go ahead and pick this cd up, it is another steller piece of work."
4,I wanna know,Joe has done it again. They may play I wanna know to death on the radio and tv. But I havent gotten tired of it yet. I have all of Joes previous CDs and I love them all. Ive read some of the reviews people gave him. Some of those people just dont know good music. Keep donig your thing Joe youll always have my support.
2,Joe Won't Be In My Cd Collection!,"Ok, now I am a guy and I really like Joe. His songs are mad cool! I think he can sing a song in a very poetic way and his lyrics are like that. Like a love poem, but I HATE the freaky songs. After reading the editorial, i will not buythis cd becuase to me the bad outweighs the good. I love the songs like ""I Wanna Know"" not songs like "" Somebody's gotta be on top""! I repulse at lyrics like that. He can be a true romantic and then be freaky. I hate that kind of personality! If you are a christian and you believe that songs like that are wrong then don't purchase this cd. There is too much bad too overlook. Don't let the nice beat lure you in because it's all about what you put in your spirit and is freak nasty songs the kind you want in your spirit?"
4,Great album,"This album is the follow from 'all that i am.' This album is slightly more pop than the last however it is still a greeat album. The best track by far on the album is the collaboration with mariah carey and nas, 'thank god i found you.' This is one of joes best songs and is also on mariah's album. Another suprisingly good track is the one with nsync, yes nsync. 'i believe in you' is one of the slightly more pop tracks on the album, but still has the R&B touch.On the whole this is a great album, although at times it may seem abit to pop for some people. To some up this album i would say its far more funky, and pop as opposed to soul. However still a good album which i guess will appeal to a wider audience."
4,Very good but not as good as his last album,"This 3rd album from Joe Thomas is good, but not as good as ""All that I am"" I found he got a little more hip hop into the songs in this album then in the 2nd album. Other than that the album does have some good R&B music that move your feet and chill too. Good songs like ""Stutter"",""Treat her like a lady"", ""Table for Two"", ""Peep Show"", ""Thank God I found you with Mariah Carey"" ,and of course ""I wanna know."" The other songs are average. This album is GOOD but not as good. Good job tho'. Keep it comin' Joe."
4,I LOVE THIS CD!!!,"Joe is one of a few artist who really captures the essence of a man in a relationship (R. Kelly, Maxwell are just a few who understand as well). This CD is for anyone who just wants to relax, kick back and have a man tell you what it is all about. Not to explict, not too mushy, just enough romance. Slow songs that make you wanna grind with the candlelight and incense burning in the background. My favorite? Hard to say...but ""Treat Her Like A Lady"" has to be it. Some men just don't know.....Get this CD!"
4,"Very Smooth, But Not For Everyone","I first became interested in Joe when I heard the ht song,""I Wanna Know"" on the radio. I downloaded the mp3 and then I downloaded another song of Joe's ""I Believe In You"" feat. *N SYNC. I soon purchased the entire album, and I was very impressed. If you like people like Brian McKnight or D'Angelo, and even Ginuwine, you are going to love this cd. The album is almost entire sex-related, with a romantic yet sometimes annoying constant reference to love-making. The lyrics on this cd are for the most part very articulate, but if you would easily get annoyed by the constant female moans in the backround in most of his songs, then this album is not for you. I personally think Joe's style is somewhat comformative, as far as the material is concerned, but Joe has a style all his own, including a soothing voice and a refreshing sense of talent."
4,Pretty Good for Number 3,"I remember way back when - when I first heard Joe's ""I'm In Love"". I haven't stopped loving him. I have all three of his CD's my favorite being the first, then his second and now this one.I was kind of surprised by the sexual content of this CD, actually I was SHOCKED, but I guess sex sells and maybe he is trying to keep up with all the other R&B artists out there. Joe is known for his smooth lines about treating the ladies right, i.e flowers, bubble baths, etc. - but I guess these days you have to show your audience that you can be a FREAK too.All that said I think his CD is worth buying. The tunes catchy - great for commuting in to work."
5,7 stars,"7 stars for this cd. There are songs that still take me back to when I was dating my then boyfriend who I'm now married to. Joe's songs are our song. Songs like Table for 2, and every other song on this album make it unforgettable. I have ordered for it...again!"
2,no title,"Though his hit ""i wanna know"" is one of the all time best jams, I don't find much else in My Name is Joe. The album just doesn't make me want to listen to it over and over and not worth my money to buy it. I like Joe and his voice but there isn't enough songs to attract me to the album. ""treat her like a lady"" and ""one life stand"" are enjoyable tracks to listen to while ""table for two"" brings a lift in spirit. The ""make it last remix"" is a good mix of hip hop and r & b but the overall album isn't that strong. Joe repeats themes but he is still able to mix up the tempos. Final rating-didn't buy the album and won't but it will be better if it's listened to long enough."
4,Praises for JOE on his third time around,"This is one of the few CDs that I listen to over and over again. JOE's song ""Treat Her Like a Lady""(Track 6), gets replayed at least four a five times a day. Joe inpresses me with his laid-back vocal styling. Through his songs, one gets the feeling that he is just a nice guy, one that you'd want to be friends with. The songs are professionally done and purposefully thoughtful. I've add JOE to that list of artists, such as Prince, Toni Braxton, and Chante Moore whose albums I buy as soon as they are released. I wish Joe much success on this album. He deserves it."
2,"joe,go back to the drawing board","i was anxious to pick up this cd,the ""all that i am"" is a classic for which i can play throughout,sad to say this new effort is not a follow-up but a attempt to capture fans who feel asleep on his excellent first two efforts, gold is will achieve, platinum time will tell.the tracks that stand out to me are ""i wanna know"",""5 6 3(joe) "",stutter"",""so beautiful"".these tracks are ok, but not dynamic, joe has the talent, but there is not a consistent flow here,too many people in the producer or director's chair, as with the last disc, joe was in command, i wanna know will the real joe please return."
3,Foamtread Slippers,"The blue slippers weren't available and I couldn't find another pair of slippers that I liked. These turned out to be a lot more comfortable than I expected and even though they are pink a color I really dislike I wear them quite a bit. If someone asked if I'd buy another pair, I would. Hopefully, next time they'd be blue..."
5,Amazing...,"This book was completely and utterly amazing. It is told in the eyes of Gwen, a strong and loving woman. By the end of the novel you feel as if you actually knew her and mourn her losses just as you celebrated her accomplishments. The Arthur-Gwen-Lancelot is portrayed beautifully. This book has absolutely peaked my interest in Arthurian times. I coulnd't put it down for a second."
5,EPIC...,"Stunning. I didn't expect to be so enthralled and captivated... I've read my share of Arthurian legend, and love the genre and age and characters... but I thought I'd already read the good ones... far better than even The Mists of Avalon, for this delves into the heart of the character where Marion Z Bradley delved into the magic (which was pretty awesome too, just saying!). Made me see Gwen in a whole new light... made me pity Lancelot... and made me adore Arthur, despite his faults, his shortcomings... We also get to meet more knights of the round tables as PEOPLE... Here is truly a world completely and lovingly crafted, with a people whom you won't soon forget. I promise you that. A long delicious read, which I wished would never end! Enjoy the read!"
5,beautifully written......,"I read at least 1 book a week and have done so for a long time..I LOVED this book. It's a must read..buy it and keep it, you will want to share it with your children someday.."
2,"Good Story, Nauseating Speech, Weak Heroine","Good story. This is the first time I have ever read such a detailed version of the Arthur and Camelot legend. He and his knights and Gwen seem as tho they really existed in the telling of this tale... BUT the speech is nauseating. If I have to read the words ""honor...love..my lord"" one more time, I may have to throw it aside. Something else I am beyond tired of, seems that Gwen has ADD or something.. Always has the tremors. On every page, she is trembling with joy, lust, passion, fear.. awful lot of trembling going on. Getting old. I would also like to add, she is a very weak female in this telling. She is apparently an angel as she is queen of not only Camelot, but also of turning the other cheek. She excells at letting others walk all over almost as much as she does at trembling."
3,"Enthralling story, horrible dialogue","This book is well worth the read. I've been a lifelong fan of Arthur and Camelot, and I've always wanted a more inciteful look into the character of Guinevere (who's often portrayed as something of a bimbo). That's not the case here. The character is well-developed and admirable. Also beautifully portrayed is the passsionate and compassionate relationship between Arthur and his queen. That being said, the language of this book will make you cringe. McKenzie's denizens of Camelot too occasionally spout modern slang. (Examples: ""I could square things with Gawaine..."", ""his chieftains must be hollering for more land..."", and my personal favorite, ""What's up, Kay?"") Then the author drops in a ""shall"" here and there in an attempt to make the language sound quaint. But once you get past this flaw, it's a nicely constructed novel and will make a nice addition to your Arthurian collection. I'll probably read it again."
4,Would have liked more about Arthur.,"The life of Guinevere before and during her marriage to King Arthur.I wish there was less of a focus on the relationship between Guinevere and Lancelot. I felt like every other issue in the kingdom centered on the two of them and the potential for ""dishonor."" The reoccurring pattern of Guinevere and Lancelot acting on their attraction, then admitting the fact, then Arthur forgiving both of them got tiring after a while. I didn't find either Guinevere or Lancelot to be likable characters. The author also includes a lot of catty behavior between women. I realize that this book was written from Guinevere's point of view, but I would have like to read more about Arthur's accomplishments and acts as king."
5,This one is for keeps.........,"I didnt know what to expect when getting this book but Nancy Mckenzie has written it so smoothly that anyone can read it and understand it. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.... what else can I say. Best book I have read in years!"
2,Love something change something,"This is a really good and fun read. It is practical, informative and inspiring. It makes you think about your life and what you need to do to change in it for the better. It is also really helpful it getting you to think creatively. I wish all books that one can claim are for business where this fun."
5,Novel to be felt,"I just would like to say that this is not a novel to be read through at once, in order to trace its plot or logic. Instead, this novel is to be felt and visualized. I am sure that you will be amazed by Proust's rare ability to describe intangible things (smell, tastes, music, etc).If you really would like to get absorbed in his world, make some tea, get madeleine, and listen to Gabriel Faure's chamber music."
3,Small font edition,"This is not a review of Proust's great novel, or of the excellent translations. It's a comment on the quality of the paperback. I read the first four volumes of this Christopher Prendergast-edited series in the hardcover VIKING USA editions, and they were very nicely done. Acid-free paper, 12-point, readable font. My understanding is that Viking can not produce the final volumes (The Prisoner, The Fugitive, and Finding Time Again) because of US copyright laws. So we are left with these Penguin paperbacks. Cheap paper. The font is small, maybe 10 point. The thin parts of the letters almost disappear. That's all. Not such a pleasure to hold in the hand or to read, either. I was unable to find a hardcover copy of the last volumes used or new, so I went with these. You may have to as well if you want to enjoy this translation as much as I have."
4,"This review is of ""The Captive"" - Book 5 of 7 Only...","The Captive is volume 5 of 7 in Marcel Proust's ""In Search of Lost Time"" series.There's not a lot of action in this book. Marcel keeps Albertine with him in his home in Paris, restricting her freedom so much that she is nearly a prisoner. He goes back and forth emotionally over her. Sometimes she makes him jealous and he becomes obsessed with her, feeling that he must love her. Then when she is docile and obedient, he feels he is becoming bored with her. He wonders if she has actually made him a prisoner, and he would be better off without her.The other plot line involves Baron de Charlus, Morel, and the Verdurins. The Verdurins become angry with the Baron. To get even with him they decide to cause trouble between him and Morel.That's it as far as the plot is concerned. But once again you have Proust's beautiful prose, filled with many memorable passages. I am looking forward to reading the final two books in this series."
