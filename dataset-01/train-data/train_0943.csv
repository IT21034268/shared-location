5,Wonderful character study set in a cultural anachronism,"Great Book! Ruggero assembles a wonderful group of characters and sets them in an insider's view of West Point. His plot is all too believable and a perfect vehicle for highlighting West Point's unique culture as well as some memorable characters. Tom Gates is my favorite. I swear I lived down the street from him at every Army post I've lived. Ruggero's villainess in another. She is a ostensibly ordinary woman who through unlucky circumstances and bad judgment leaves a trail of destruction behind her. She illustrates the point that villains are not evil people, but real people who make bad judgments. If you're interested in the military culture, you can't pass up this book. If you're a student of human nature don't miss it. If you like an entertaining novel with some ""laugh out loud"" passages read this book."
5,Hooked me...,"I started listening to BHT when they had this and Midnight Radio out, and I could not put them away for months. The sound is not always smooth but it is pure, and these two albums paint an accurate picture of what the early live shows around Boulder were like. Must admit that I like the first two much more than most of the following efforts which were much more commercial friendly, but the latest studio and live albums are much closer to this raw, bluesy, bar-band sound. I like it so much I have a backup copy in case I kill my first."
2,Falls flat,"Although I was initially drawn into the story of the Chambers family and enjoyed learning about all the characters, the device used of continually leaping ahead in time made for a very disjointed story. I lost interest in the middle and had to force myself to finish the book. It didn't help that so many characters were introduced along the way that at the end I forgot who many of them were. Still, it's an extremely well-written book, especially for a first-time author."
2,Mediocre,"I usually love generational stories but this rather plodding. Not much action to it, just a sweet little story. None of the characters were that interesting."
4,Really draws you in,"This is a finely crafted novel about everyday people having everyday lives over a period of some 50 years. The author looks at life, death, love, hate, injury and healing, and all in all does so in a simple prose that draws you in and makes you really care about what happens to the characters.However, if I have one small criticism, it is that the book is simply not long enough to give all of the detail of the lives of the characters, and it is this which stops it from being a truly spectacular novel. For instance we know that one of the children born will grow with some sort of physical or mental burden, but it is only hinted at until she is almost fully grown. Perhaps this is what makes the book so tantalising - the prospect that more will be revealed later, but I found that there was often insufficient to whet the appetite.But in the scope of the novel it is a small criticism, and it is well worth reading."
1,What ???,"This joker's evidence of Chistian persecution has to do with Christmas cards? Ho.Ho.Ho. I certainly don't want my highway taxes to pay for state crews to erect religious signs. I can see it all now, standard highway signs replaced by signs with various religious symbols telling us heathens when to stop, slow down, caution, etc. Limbaugh must have been tapping Rush's pill supply when writing this tome. I say feed him to the lions. And Happy Kwanza."
2,My religion is a private matter!,"I don't disagree with some of this book but the bottom line for me is that I pray where I want to pray, teach my kids what I want to teach them and live my life in a way that comforms to my values. No one has ever tried to take that away from me, nor could they. I don't need p.d.r's (public displays of religion) or political backing to practice my faith. It is within me, not somewhere out there in the town square. If your faith is strong, these things should not be necessary for your beliefs to be unshakeable. Until someone discovers the ability to reach into my soul and pull The Lord out of me, I don't fear the same things Mr. Limbaugh fears. In fact, I question the depth of his faith if it rides on whether the government gives approval to it or not."
1,Crying for 'special rights',"This book is a polemic demanding special rights for people who claim to be Christians. I'm sorry you can't give people 'special rights' in America, we have a Consitiution and you can't get rid of that either.Im sorry I can't recommend this book. It's not reality-based and I can't recommend it."
1,"Actually, it's more -5","David Limbaugh, hanging tenuously to the tattered coattails of his kinsman, Rush, claims Christianity is in grave peril in the USA. Fewmets! Aside from the fact D.L. is trying to press buttons on Limbots everywhere, religion is in no danger, and may be healthier than ever before.I think the problem for a certain type of Christian (and we've all encountered them ), is that people are a lot less tolerant of being bullied, harranged, harrassed, hassled and put upon by these in your face religious loons who know, far better than you in fact, what is best for you. I have no patience with them or what they're selling, but it doesn't mean I'm anti Christian.This book is nonsense. Limbaugh is trading on his name and on the paranoid fantasies of persecution a certain type of person relishes."
1,Somebody needs to check their privilege,"Attention RWNJs: If you are a white, christian male in the US, you are most definitely not ""persecuted"". Unless you mean that it's not becoming a christian theocracy fast enough for you."
1,Sounds like more blither to me.,"I keep hearing about rubbish like ""school children are forbidden to pray before football games,"" or how awful it is that ""nativity scenes are banned from municipal property.""First, it's not true that schoolchildren may not pray. Anyone can pray any time, and there's no way to detect it, let alone stop it. What may not happen, and rightly so, is for the State to endorse a particular kind of prayer, or prayer at all, by allowing it to be broadcast over the PA to people who may not share that prayer.As for the idea of nativity scenes being forbidden, what's wrong with that? Until/unless you can give full and equal representation to every religion, you must give it to none, in the interests of simple fairness and justice.I may borrow this book from the library, but you can bet I won't be buying it in any way that will get money into Mr. Limbaugh's hands."
1,definition of separation; any questions?,"Just in case you think religion should play ANY role in our government, here is the definition of separation. Remember that our founding fathers insisted on including this as a WRITTEN portion of our constitution!Definition: [n] the act of dividing or disconnecting[n] the social act of separating or parting company; ""the separation of church and state""[n] (law) the cessation of cohabitation of man and wife (either by mutual agreement or under a court order)[n] sorting one thing from others; ""the separation of wheat from chaff""; ""the separation of mail by postal zones""[n] the distance between things; ""fragile items require separation and cushioning""[n] termination of employment (by resignation or dismissal)[n] coming apart[n] the space where a division or parting occurs; ""he hid in the separation between walls""[n] the state of lacking unitySynonyms: breakup, detachment, interval, legal separationAntonyms: unification, union"
1,Limbaugh,"Again another conservative SPIN. It wasn't worth my time or money. Dribble Dribble....Sent the book to Goodwill!!!!! Hopefully all the neocon books will go into the recycle bin after the 2004 elections. Religion is different for everyone and there is a separation of church and state. Alot of us are not Christians..........Again, the neocons are telling me I should worship their ""g""od."
5,Every Christian needs a copy of this book...,"Thank you Mr Limbaugh for this book...I hope it will wake the sleeping Giant and we will take back,and begin to practice what we have been fooled into thinking was just a private and personal opinion...Apparently Not....I am recomending it to all our friends ...."
1,Most Liberals are also Christians,"The author of this books makes the lame assumption that a liberal cannot be a Christian. However, most liberals are also Christians who happen to be more tolerant of people who are ""different."" Conservatives, on the other hand, believe that everyone must accept their right-wing agenda. They are similar to the taliban in Afghanistan, except for the fact that they aren't murdering others who believe differently than them...yet...Wait they have started murdering Doctors who perform abortions and one of them was responsible for the Oklahoma City bombing as well. Therefore, I would say they are very similar to extremists in other countries. This book is just right-wing rambling about something that doesn't exist."
1,Poor Wittle Kristians,"Anytime you do not follow lockstep with the so-called Christians who spew nothing but racist hatred and homophobic bile then you are ""trying to wipe out Christianity."" Oh Puhleez! Yeah, those Christians sure have it rough don't they? Hate to break it to Mr. Limbaugh but Jesus was a liberal, too. Oh Lord, save me from your followers."
1,are you kidding me?,"mr. limbaugh makes some interesting points in this book, but they're all unfortunately for nothing when one takes into account that the christian religion, or any relgion for that matter, does not and should not play a part in the way government is run. you want to pray in school - you have every right to. just do it quietly, to and to yourself. i'm sure you'll be able to get away with it. this book is a joke."
1,"Book: poorly written, over-simplifies issues, insulting.","This book is one of the worst I have ever read in my life, I cannot believe its on a best-seller list. The only reason I actually could justify for giving it 1 star (which I have too.) is that its Dust Jacket was extremely clever. (The author clearly didn't design it.) He rants against liberals who he claims despise christianity. Yet most of the liberals he describes are in fact christians. His view of liberalism, isn't the same as those held by most of the christians, even the fundamentalist christians I know. My fundementalist christian friends are all very upset with the republican party. He also seems to be very ignorant of the establishment clause of the first amendment. Not only is his writing ignorant. It is the largerst self righteous filfth I have read since the left behind series. This exceeds it. He is clearly showing hate through out the book which I have always thought was not considered a christian value."
2,Persecution Complex,"Baaaah.Everybody's got an issue. Fundamental Christian, Fundamental Jew, Fundamental Liberal...all getting their little toes stepped on. They are all willing to step on each other, though. There is no monopoly on wisdom, nor is there a monopoly on persecution complexes. How about pagans, the only religious minority in this country that has actually been hung for its beliefs in a systematic way by government?There are some fundamental truths in all the religions, that the religious zealots (including ""liberals"") forget in their quest for power. Religion is only politics, taking the Divine's name in vain.Namaste'"
1,Jesus was a Liberal.,"I know I may be reading a bit into it, but there always seems to be a slight anti-semetic undercurrent when conservatives use the term ""Liberal"". For you fundementalists, remember:1. Jesus was a JEW, he was his whole life and was when he died.2. Jesus was a Radical Liberal who fought for the rights of the prostitutes and losers.Any man who does this today would be attacked by the right wing as Liberal, and by implication, anti-christian.This idea of Liberalism somehow being the opposite of Christanity is insane - liberal ideas are far more Christian than the ""It's MY money, I'm not helping YOU !"" attitude of this new conservatism. These poeple screaming about their rights being attacked were the same people using the same arguments gainst the civil rights movement in the 60's."
1,"read some science books instead, fools.",the bible belongs in the fiction section.religion can't die out soon enough.stop brainwashing your children by sending them to church. that's what happened to you.
4,Christians can't even associate with the Boy Scouts,"What's our world come to when a self-described Christian can't even freely associate with The Boy Scouts without being unduly upbraided by the liberals for his/her faith? I'm a Boy Scout troup leader and I know exactly where Mr. Limbaugh is coming from. They want to jam their atheist viewpoint down our throats, but we, on the other hand, are denied our freedom of association and religion granted us by the 1st Amendment. Heathen violence in cartoons is condoned by the Left, but Christians in the form of vegetables is evil. Go figure."
1,We Christians Are Victims!,"We Christians are victims! Victims! Poor us! Please smother us with pity. We represent only 85% of Americans, and we are being persecuted by the tiny minority. Somebody please save us. All we want is to erect our Christian symbols everywhere, force every American child to pray during school, and cram our moral values down everyone else's throat, and they won't let us. It's not fair, and those other people are big meanies. Waaaaaaaah."
1,Bullcrap that smells!,"There are two kinds of Christians. Those who practice their faith as best they can and who seek to raise their children with worthwhile belief.Then there are the political ""Christians"" who aren't very Christian and who are intent on cramming their twisted views down everyone's thoats -- and grabbing political power. They have no respect for fellow Christians who do not want their children indoctrinated with someone's elses theology in school or in the courts or anywhere else paid for from tax money. And they have even less regard for those of other faiths. Tolerance, compasion and acceptance are Christian ideals.Limbaugh should take a strong lesson about public morality and private cesspools from his drug-addled more famous brother. The Big fat idiot.He should also learn the difference between Mississippi and Pennsylvania. He has the same careless regard for truth as his brother. Christians love the truth. It's not in this book."
1,Conservative Propaganda???,"I could not believe this book! Our country was founded on the principles of religious freedoms, yet also on the seperation of church and state. Is that really so hard to understand? There is good reason behind this distinction and I am not certain that it is Constitutional to consider this book as fact! If these people are so mad about Christianity not being the foundation of public schools, there is no reason that they couldn't go to a private school! If it bothers them that much, then they can certainly pay the money, rather than make a stink..."
1,should have went on e-bay..,The reason I'm giving this a bad review is simply because the book took over two weeks to get to my home. That along with the high shipping charge is simply ridiculous...
1,Boundless Hilarity,"Saying that any American Christian is persecuted just automatically kills the case immediately. I wonder how this got past the publisher without having a humor label attached to it. Persecution is something no Limbaugh fan can fathom. Then again, self-pity seems to be the Limbaugh way for both him and his pathetically insecure brother. This is all you can expect from that gene pool."
1,Everyone's a victim.,"Oh goodness. Just when the average not-so-religious Joe American was starting to grow weary of every possible minority-sub-group claiming persecution by the majority, Christians have to chime in to do their own whining. I remember a time when conservatives' eyes would roll when they heard about how groups of Americans were being marginalized. Now they're being marginalized themselves and, as such, now they're whining too. How did American multiculturalism degrade to a chorus of cry babies?No, there is no reason to put a 5 ton statue praising the 10 commandments in a courthouse and you can't pray over the loudspeaker in a public school. Get over it. Move on."
1,Divine Intervention,"If Jesus Christ Himself were to return, he would be deemed the most un-Christian of all men by David Limbaugh and his kind who, frankly, embarrass me by calling themselves Christians. These fools do not know the Jesus I came to know and love in a small country church nearly half a century ago. My Jesus would never condone these men's behavior, but would suffer them to come unto Him for forgiveness. Mark my word, divine intervention is at work here. Rush was first, David is next."
2,Persecution,"If all you read in this book were the first page or two of each chapter you would cry ""paranoia"" and neo-con extremism. David L. like his brother Rush wears his bias on his sleeve and tends to over-state his case for his fundamentalist and Catholic audience.But the redeeming value of the book is the review of the history of the christian movement from the arrival of the western europeans to this part of the continent. Needless to say, I could not and would not try to verify every anecdotal story in the book and certainly his references leave room for question (newspaper quotes and a lot of hearsay evidence). And to his credit it even provides a positive glance toward the liberal view from time to time.So there is value in this book for those of us are trying to find some middle ground between the self-righteous right and the pc-driven left."
1,Waste of Time,"I picked up Limbaugh's book with the intention of understanding the other side of the argument. Instead, I got the usual shrill, baseless arguments that emanate from the extreme right.Limbaugh's book is replete with sweeping generalizations written to appeal to the right wing's lowest common denominator. Read the endnotes and you'll see sources that are either dependably right wing or - should Limbaugh actually quote a mainstream or left wing source - horribly misconstrued or just plain taken out of context.I highly recommend this book for the mindless, right wing ditto-head who prefers to let republican fat cats do their thinking for them. It is a perfect example of right wing propaganda."
1,Please Read Up On This Subject!,"Thomas Jefferson and James Madison pointed out that our legal system is not based on Christianity but on English common law initiated centuries before Christ. We need more education in this country! Every high school should require a class in Comparative Religion. I've been reading letters written by America's founding fathers in which they clearly state their intentions. Historians and anthropologists say that the story of Christ is based mainly on the stories of Krishna and Attis. Here are some books which are far more informative and realistic than Limbaugh's book:PLEASE READ:The Book Your Church Doesn't Want You To Read, by LeedomLosing Faith in Faith, by BarkerThe Christ ConspiracyWhy the Religious Right is Wrong about the Separation of Church and State, by Robert Boston"
1,"Delusional, Another Tedious Christian Tract","I resent being lumped in with the devil when the author says, ..""they are legion.."", meaning anyone who doesn't agree with his views.Christian fundamentalists will be fine, though, as long as they don't devolve into witch-burning.Most of them are merely bad theater. The tiger pictured on the cover probably has more innate wisdom than the writer of this paranoid propaganda.Score one for the cat!"
5,Buy it after your first sonogram!,"As soon as I found out I was pregnant with a boy, I checked this book out of our local library. I found it so easy to read and such a great resource that I had to buy a copy for my own. It offers clear insight to the various stages of a boy's life into manhood. The metaphors for the various types of discipline can get to be a little much but the point is well made. Although I grew up with a younger brother, this book has already given me so much more sensitivity to the needs of a young boy that I look forward to raising my 11-week old son into manhood. I've quoted it incessantly to friends and can't help but shake my head at the parents of unruly teenage boys on talk shows, thinking they should have read the book again and again while their sons were growing up. An invaluable resource for any woman faced with the daunting task of raising a child to be a man, especially if she has never been able to understand men."
1,Of no use at all,"After 2 daughters, I had hoped that this book would help me understand my totally foreign son. Instead, it gave generic, common sense, heard it all before child rearing advice that is easily applied to any child,whether male or female. I gained no insight as to why I find my son more challenging than my daughters were at his age,nor have I learned anything I hadn't heard before from ""Reviving Ophelia"" or any other revelatory parenting advice book. It was irksome to constantly see the author's ideas invoked as unique to raising boys, as if girls would not also benefit from the hardly original concepts of consistent discipline and active listening."
4,Boys will be boys,"This was a pretty good book. It helped me understand that there are quite a few differences between raising a boy and raising a girl, aside from the obvious reasons. If you are a single mother (or the father is absent or not really involved) and are raising a boy by yourself, I would highly recommend this book."
3,"Good, Common-Sense Advice (if you have a NORMAL child)","This book is big on showing understanding and patience to your child, but it doesn't help much with a child who is already having trouble in school and is defiant."
3,They could be a bit more comfortable,The mini over the ear styly would be more comfortable than the tabe that get jammed into your ears.The work fine. The sound is good. Just not a comfortable as they could be.
2,Uncomfortable,"These headphones are uncomfortable on my ears, they also don't stay on my head very well. They work well as an antenna. I have some Delphi over the ear headphones for my other XMtogo radio that are much more comfortable, but unfortunately these are the only headphones for the Inno. It is also disappointing that the plug only works on the Inno radio. I do like the volume control on it."
1,Lasted a month,"Worked pretty good for about a month, at which point the XM said the antenna was bad. Waste of money for me."
3,Why the antenna part of the phones fail,"Failure of the antenna part of the Belkin head phones is caused by the extreamly thin wire strands inside the headset cord braking. I had a Roady 2 portible purchased in 2006 that used the same phones with a different plug end and I had the same problems. I purchaed 3 phones over 2 years. They don't make them anymore so I purchased a Inno and I see I will be getting the same problems as before. If the wire inside the cord had more strands, the headsets would work better, longer. Here are some tips on making the headsets last longer.Never tug on the cord when removing the plug from the radio and be careful when pluging the cord in the radio not to pinch or put any pressure on the cord.Try to keep the cord from swinging as you walk or jog.Don't let the cord bend sharply in one place a lot of times. Easy to do where the cord inters the radio plug end.Hope this helps"
1,Defective Product,These headphones are expensive for a product that malfunctions for no reason after very little use. I recommend toughing it out with the reception you can get from the inno itself.
2,good for a few weeks,"Like others, I've had the problem of the headphones working great for a few weeks. I think I know why reception goes bad and the check antenna message comes. The headphones and the charger are plugged into the same spot on the radio. I think that each time you unhook the antenna you destroy some of the connection and the antenna doesn't maintain contact with the radio. I've had to start holding the radio and squeezing the connection to keep reception."
2,They Hurt,Great reception... they HURT!!!!! Can use it as an antenna... then plug in some other earphones at the same time.. this one dosen't stop them from working as well... these monsters jam in your ears and are really uncomfortable... GIVE us something with better headphone to ear contact... ouch!!!!!
3,XM Antenna headphones,The headphones work very well for hiking and listening to XM radio but the way they fit in the ears is not very comfortable.
1,Not a Good buy,"I have had two headsets go bad( check antenna ). The first set was replaced by the store I purchased it from (lasted 40 days). Now the replacement is bad (got the replacement the day after Thanksgiving 2006). Not a good buy at all. The old Trash80's by RadioShack were built with better parts. What do you expect form a company that makes mice and keyboards. We need Sony, Panasonic or some other company that makes headphone to get in the game."
1,OK if it works!,"Mine behaved like the others did. Worked for few weeks then the Satellite reception went dead with the Inno displaying the infamous msg 'Check Antenna'!So, if you want get a new one every few weeks, then go for it. I am not."
3,XM Atenna headphones,PRODUCT WORKS REALLY WELL. DRAW BACK IS THEY ARE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE TO WEAR. FOUND MY SELF TAKING THEM OFF QUITE FREQUENTLY. AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A CLEAR VIEW OF THE SKY THEY RECIEVE SIGNAL REALLY WELL.
3,Mediocre product,The xm antenna headphones for the inno definately improve the outdoor reception. That is the good thing. The sound quality definately could be better. The volume level is quite low. Some sound quality improvements would sure be nice.
2,Not so impressive,"I was expecting a lot more from those Headphones for Xm . While traveling by bus around the country, I had no signal almost everywhere, so there were almost useless."
1,Ouch!,"The audio quality of these headphones is excellent. However, the in-ear pieces were much too large for my ears and wearing them was excruciating! My Dremmel to the rescue, I was able to grind off enough of the plastic and now they are at least bearable. I am a 6 ft male and have average sized ears. That these do not come with ear size options is inexcusable."
1,Waste of money,I purchased this item to increase the reception on the inno when it wasn't on the docking station. The reception was no better with these headphones than with the earbud ones that came with the inno.
2,"Good, for a while....","These headphones do not stay on your head very well, sliding forward. Not a really big deal, though. The real problem is they work great (reception-wise) for a while, then all of a sudden you'll get a constant ""check antenna"" message that covers the whole screen and reception is bad. I've gone through 2 of these headphones in less than one year. They're disposable."
3,"Great reception, not-so-great for comfort","I'm surprised at those who say the reception is not improved. I use them on the bus and can keep my Inno in my coat pocket. Previously I would have to keep repositioning the Inno to keep the signal from dropping out as we moved; no longer.They are, however, not designed for comfort. I find them much more tolerable than some of the reviewers do, but it is annoying when you tilt your head forward and they fall forward. They're great while sitting still, or going for a walk, but I wouldn't recommend using them while doing anything more active.I still recommend them, but they could be so much better with some design effort."
5,Works Great!,"Our XM INNO would cut out often when wearing it on the arm or on the belt, but now it plays without interuption using these headphones. Very satisfied with this product."
3,Good Antenna Poor Earphones,"This product must have been designed by a robot with steel ears. The earphones are so uncomfortable that I can only wear them for a minute or two before experiencing pain. As another reviewer has said, there is a workaround - using other more comfortable earphones plugged into the earphone jack and using these poorly designed earphones as an antenna only.A good external antenna would have been a better product choice for me in this case."
1,Do not buy!!!!,These work well for a couple of weeks and then they go defective (check antenna) message that covers the whole screen
1,Uncomfortable,"The antenna headphones do marginally increase reception; however, these are by far the most uncomfortable thing that I have ever used. Unfortunately, there is currently no other antenna / headphone unit on the market, so these are it. I will say, though, that while the unit fails miserably in its intended function (as headphones) because of the extreme discomfort, they do make a serviceable stationary antenna, which I have found useful during travel (though that speaks to the shoddy antenna on the inno itself).All in all, I give the headphone unit one star, with the caveat that the one star is for its use as a travel antenna."
2,Belkin XM Antenna Headphones,"Agree with other posters in that these worked great......for 3 weeks. Then, every time I used them reception went out but only while I used them so it's definitely the headphones. If it's true that others have had such recurring problems then something is wrong with the design, can't endorse them at all."
2,Works well but a little uncomfortable,"The product itself work great, I use them when I take walks and I rarely lose signal like I did before I had them. However the ear pieces are plastic, and little uncomfortable in your ears. I usually can't stand wearing them for any extended period."
1,I hate them,"I've never used such a painful set ever. I hope the people who designed these have to wear them daily for a year. The ear buds that came with my INNO are comfortable, but I get no reception while mobile.These have a little better reception, but not much and my ears hurt so badly right now I get even get them near my ears. Who designed these anyway? They need to go back to the drawing table....folks don't waste your money.Make the company go back and find a better design."
1,not good at all,These headphones do not help reception at all and the earpieces hurt your ears. I bought a pair tried them for 2 weeks and returned them.
2,Not loud enough,"I agree with the other reviewers that the headphones are uncomfortable, but my biggest problem is the volume. I don't lose reception on the bus, but the headphones are so quiet I can barely hear it over the loud bus noises. The earbuds that come with the radio are great, and shut out all the bus noise, but since they don't have an antenna built in it loses reception. What we need is the earbud headphones with the antenna from this unit built into it. Until then, save your money and wait for something better to come out."
3,Not to kill for...,Not what I expected... Little uncomfortable and not that good reception. Avoid if possible.
2,XM Inno antenna headphones,"The headphones offered only a slight improvement in reception and were not significantly better in many areas. They are also uncomfortable to wear, heavy and inflexible. The bottom line is that I haven't used them in the past month."
1,Not a durable product,"I have gone through 3 sets of these headphones in the past 6 months. I have the same problem that many other people report: they work fine at first, but then the antenna goes bad, and the message ""Check Antenna"" appears on the Inno's screen.I bought my first pair on eBay; that pair lasted 3 weeks. I bought another pair from Amazon; that pair lasted 2 months. Belkin replaced the 2nd pair free of charge. The replacement pair lasted 2 1/2 months. I have no doubt that Belkin will send me another replacement, but it is a pain in the butt to have to ship these things back to the manufacturer every 8-10 weeks.Unfortunately, these are the only signal-boosting available for the Inno at the moment."
1,Not worth the hassles,"Same as everyone previously, I would like an explanation for why these headphones fail after just a few weeks of routine use.I'm on my second pair, which just went out. As with the first pair and same as everyone else for no apparent reason, the satellite reception just stops. The display on the Pioneer Inno XM receiver shows the message ""check antenna"" or ""no signal.""So far Belkin has replaced the defective ones without charge (you have to pay shipping to return defective pair), but bottom line is you almost need to have 2 pair and ""swap"" them out one pair at a time in order to keep one working. I do not think it is out in left field to have a product that last more then 2 month at a time.I too have yet to find any alternatives. No one else makes anything similar that I can find. If anyone has found out the problem is with these things, I would love to know also!"
1,These headphones are junk!,"I don't like leaving negative reviews, but I feel I have to so others know what to expect.I am having the same issue as others with good reception initially and then two months later getting a ""check antenna"" message. For a $40 product, I would expect it to last a bit longer than that.Tomorrow I am sending two pairs back to Belkin for replacement. This is the second time for one pair and the first time for the other.Despite the hassle, Belkin seems okay with replacing them. They also pay for the shipping on the replacements.If you have to send them back to Belkin, use the express option. They put a hold on your CC and send you out replacements right away. You have 20 days to send them back at your expense via UPS, Fedex, DHL or USPS. They request you use tracking for the package - otherwise you have no recourse with them if they are lost."
2,"Great, while they still work","Great until one day it just stopped working. In less than1 year, these headphones just died on me."
1,Mine conked out too.,"I checked out the reviews here before I bought my antenna headphones. I thought maybe the people that were complaining about the headphones just quitting on them were exaggerating or just unlucky. I had mine for only a couple months. Then, one Saturday I was preparing to listen to football on my XM, and guess what? No signal. Just like the others said, they quit working for no apparent reason. While they worked, they performed reasonably well. I didn't use them as earphones. I wore the antenna around my neck and used separate earphones. It's hard to imagine a more poorly designed product for comfort or durability, but unfortunately they are the only game in town right now, as far as I know."
2,Disappointment,"This should have been an engaging book about a fascinating woman who attracted the greatest artists of her time, and whose own background and talents were worth exploring. But, she never emerges as a character in her own right, existing here only as a reflection of (and thorn in the sides of) her husbands. Does the author not think enough of women to take their own stories seriously, or did he not do his homework to research her adequately? Alas, Tom Lehrer told this story better, with humor, in far fewer words."
2,"The Artist's Wife--Somewhat incomplete, inconsistent","This book was a disappointment. While the subject matter was very intriguing--the life and loves of a famous woman in Europe at the beginning of the century, I found Phillip Max writing unbearable. He does not manage to give any depth to his characters. We learn about Alma and her inconsistences and caprices, but we do not understand what drives her. The reader is left to his/her own trying to figure out why Alma and the people around her act the way they do. At points tedious, the story rushes through Alma's life and does not leave the reader with a real idea of time.The only plus to this novel that I found is that it sparked my interest to look for Alma's autobiography--I would never think to rely on Max for even a fictional perspective on her."
5,Enough is ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!,"If this hasn't been said before, then I'll say it. STOP REFERENCING THE SCENE FROM AMERICAN PSYCHO! No disrespect to Huey Lewis and the News, but all these repetitive quotes on Fore and Sports is tired and old. If you really want to reference a movie, how about some of Huey's dialogue in the movie Duets, or any TV roles he played. Aside from my rant, Fore is a very good record. It definitely ties with Sports as the group's best work. Notable tracks are pretty much all the singles: ""Stuck With You"", ""Hip To Be Square"", and ""Jacob's Ladder"". Another favorite is ""I know What I Like""."
5,Their most accomplished album,"Their early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercial and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far much more bitter, cynical sense of humour. In '87, Huey released this, Fore, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is ""Hip to be Square"", a song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity, and the importance of trends, it's also a personal statement about the band itself."
3,"oh, to be young again","i got this before i realized that _sports_ is the only huey lewis album that anyone needs (and everybody needs it). don't get me wrong, i'm a big huey lewis fan, and some of his greatest hits are here: ""stuck with you,"" ""doing it all for my baby"" (a splendid song), ""hip to be square."" they've kept me from pawning it off on someone else."
2,An Accidental Purchase,"Huey Lewis is a walking talking cliché. His music is basically classic rock light. When you first here it, it sounds familiar, the longer you listen, the less appealing it becomes. Everything he does has done before and better, and will be done better again. Best for all if he just sank back into the mire. Truth be told, I picked this album up completely by accident, I bought a copy of Dire Straits COMMUNIQUE at a second hand shop and this record was inside, thus I am denied the pleasure of selling it back for credit, of course, I did enjoy throwing it away."
5,I love this cd!,"My Mom and I have had this cd for a long, long time, and I always have loved it! I am and always have been obsessed with the songs ""Doing It (All For My Baby)"" and ""Hip To Be Square""! They've always been my favorite songs on the album!"
5,Steady the Axe and Plastic sheeting ...,"Their early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercial and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost.He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a much more bitter, cynical sense of humor. In '87, Huey released Fore, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is ""Hip to be Square"", a song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity, and the importance of trends, it's also a personal statement about the band itself.And I'm number 12 in the que to have done this ... yawwwn."
3,Great 80s fun feel,"I first picked this up in 1986 and fell in love with it on the spot. I played it like every day. Now, in 1999, I find it spending less time in the CD player. It did not age well at all. It does have its moments! With songs like ""Jacobs Ladder,"" ""Whole Lotta Lovin'"" and my all time favorite Huey song ""I Know What I Like!"" By far the best start to finish will always be ""Sports"" album, a true 5 star album!!"
4,Tune List,1. Jacob's Ladder2. Stuck With You3. Whole Lotta Lovin'4. Doing It All for My Baby5. Hip to Be Square6. I Know What I Like7. I Never Walk Alone8. Forest for the Trees9. Naturally10. Simple as That
5,Best CD,"FORE! is like one of the best Huey Lewis CD's that I have ever listened to, I grew up listening to this CD and I urge anybody who starts to listen to him to start with this CD!"
3,Good introduction to Powerbuilder,An ok book to start with Powerbuilder. I expected much more from the author. I also found some editing errors in the text that would confuse anyone just learning Powerbuilder.
2,Lacking in total usefullness,If you purchase this book hoping to use the CD to follow the examples; DON'T. I tried to install the material following the author's instructions and had no success. When I e-mailed the author with an description of the error message; I received a non-response. I now have 1200 pages that should be tied to a working database to assist me in my development which now will not happen. Wait for the movie.
2,Good Paperweight.,"Although this book provides a mildly structured approach to attacking powerbuilder, it lacks any qualitites one should look for as a developer. Index is lacking, poor examples, the order in which it presents its information is rather poor. Highlights of the book: it doesn't go in depth with much, and were it not so poorly written, it could be a good beginners manual."
1,Premium Price for Walmart Quality...,"I am a long-time Amazon purchaser, but this is my 1st product review-that's how egregious the difference btwn the product & the product description.Having read the description-""furniture grade compressed cabinetry"" ""durable melamine finish,"" then looking up the plywood grading scale, I paid $138 (now listing for $145) for the item.Calling it Walmart quality is probably an insult to Walmart's line of cheap pressboard crap as the pressboard was so loosely bound that there are multi edge/corners with ""gaps"" btwn the ""durable melamine finish"" & not-so-""furniture grade cabinetry"". There is no doubt these gapped edges will be the first place the finish peels away from the pressboard.I took a photo of (one of many) gapped edges, & the looseness of the pressboard is also visible, & hope I can figure out how to attach it."
4,Saved my Life!,"I just couldn't find anything on my desk, until I bought this desk organizer. cleared so much room for me and my papers. I just didn't like the color that did not match the picture but .. because it changed my life I let it go.Oh and ... one piece was missing .. the support for one of the drawer but .. minor..."
1,Blech!,"Please, save your money. An attempt by a less-than-mediocre artist to imitate Enya. Poor sound quality, cheesy synthesizers that mock Enya's artful compositions, and a female vocalist with a pathetic voice."
1,Just plain Bad!!!!,"For you lovers of Enya, Don't bother with this one. This is the first time ever that after three cuts, I pulled it out of my player, and dumped it in the garbage! None of the power and grace of Enya, Sutton has a voice like a squeak toy! Avoid this one! This doesn't even deserve one star!!!!"
1,Barrfffff,This album is utter garbage. Sounds like it was recorded in the back seat of a diesel Volkswagen. Run away! Stick with the real thing...
4,Another California desert madwoman,"More immediately accessible than her previous work, Musings Of A Creekdipper, but by the same token, its very accessibility keeps it from brilliance. Less risks taken = less moments of brilliance. That said, the title track, ""Water To Drink"", has me compulsively tapping my feet. It's far from a let-down; fans old and new won't be disappointed in purchasing this album."
4,Another Offbeat Gem from Victoria,"This marks Victoria's triumphant return to the positive vibes and uplifiting vision of her 1994 album, ""Loose."" What ties these quirky, offbeat songs together is Victoria's beaming worldview. There are those who will find her high-pitched, girlish voice annoying, but if you give it a chance it will grow on you. Victoria's music is truly like nothing else out there. My favorite songs on this album are ""Grandma's Hat Pin,"" ""Gladys and Lucy,"" ""Junk"" and ""Claude."" The only reason I did not give this CD 5 stars is because I would have preferred to hear more of Victoria's original works in place of the 3 covers."
3,all to easy,"good production, mixing old time sounding jazz songs(most prominent, IMHO), eastern sounding, easy listening, country... With some grand arangements of most of the songs. It's a mixed bag of songs. Despite that her voice maybe not suits this grand setting, its still good. Its hard to to imagine that this is the same girl that recorded a very weird cover of Neil Youngs "" Dont let it bring you down"" 12 years ago. More mainstream now but still worthwhile."
5,Quality covers,I've only had them 2 months but they are well made and I have no reason to think they won't withstand the AZ summers.
4,great cover for larger chaise,We had a difficult time finding a cover which would accomodate a larger chaise. This fit well and the adjustable bottom works great.
3,Not Bad But You Should Check Out Miles First,I like a few of the songs on this album (especially Some Cow Fonque) but if you like this then you should check out the real deal. Mile Davis was years ahead with his album Doo-Bop. In his wildest dreams Marsalis wouldn't have ever thought of doing an album like this if Miles hadn't already done it. Miles was way ahead of his time creating new musical genres before anyone could even imagine what he was thinking about.
5,Buckshot LeFonque!!!!,"Wow! I found this cd to be very unique and cool. Its hip and jazzy. ""Some Cow Fonque"", my personal favorite, is fast and funky, while ""Breakfast at Denny's"" is good too. I'm also starting to get to enjoy all of the other songs as well. Its very likable."
4,mistaken identity for Matt Dillion,"This made for TV movie was aired in 1992. It has an interesting plot and I enjoyed watching it. If you like James Arness,and haven't seen this one,get it for your collection."
3,Could have been better,"Can't help but be a compelling story, but the author at times seemed to be relying on hearsay, footnotes would have helped. Interesting when the author himself appeared as part of the story in mid chapter, so maybe he wasn't as objective as he could have been, which to me was the major drawback of the book. Especially since the book cost 27 bucks. Wait for the paperback."
5,"FINALLY, the TRUTH is EXPOSED!!!","This book is a MUST read for every young Amercian who is thinking about joining the Navy. Thank God that Mr. Thompson took the time to uncover the truth about what those involved in the IOWA investigation tried to do to Clayton Hartwig's memory and reputation. I simply cannot believe that the Navy allowed this to happen..it should be ASHAMED!!!! Milligan, Edney, Micelli, Kelso,and last but not least, Captain Fred Moosally...may you all rot in hell. How can any of you possibly sleep at night? My only hope is that some day you will all realize what anguish you have caused Clayton Hartwig's loved ones and friends. And all without a single shread of evidence...how dare you?? Thank you Mr. Thompson for exposing these people and the horrible things that they've done. God Bless the IOWA-47."
3,Very informative but a little disappointing,"I am a sister of one of the men that was killed in Turret Two during the explosion. The only thing that I would like to say is that I'm a little upset that ALL the men that were in the turret were not recognized. It seems only the ones who played an important role etc. were mentioned. All the men in the Turret were important and I'm sure all had their futures set like my brother. He was going to attend college after the Navy to be an Electrical Engineer, he had a photographic memory and was a very smart and generous man. The whole reason my brother was on the Iowa was due to one of the officers flunking him out of a class due to the reason that he did not think my brother was political enough. When in fact my brother had passed! All this just upsets me and I'm glad the truth is finally coming out! We all needed the whole truth just so we could finally get some sort of peace."
3,A Good Technical Read,"In 10 years I have never read a more concise condemnation of the Navy and the NIS for their mis-handling of the investigation. Mr. Thompson does an excellent job of showing the so-called investigation for the farce it was.His treatment of the human side of this tragedy is somewhat less exemplary. His depictions of the treatment of ""witnesses"" and ""subjects"" by the NIS are sometimes as inaccurate or incomplete as the NIS Investigator's notes (upon which he seems to rely too heavily). Mr. Thompson has included in this book items which are of no relevance seemingly because they are titilating and/or salacious.One can only assume that Mr. Thompson is still more journalist than author."
3,Tai Chi dvd,This is not that easy for someone with no experience at all. It might be useful after taking a few classes to practice with.
2,"Decent Picture, BAD Sound","I had bought this Polaroid LCD TV for my dad's kitchen to replace his 13"" CRT tv with mono sound. The picture was okay, but the sound was terrible. It was worse than the 13"" tv's one speaker. The problem is that the sound is mostly mid-range, like it's coming from a telephone receiver. There's very little low and high range frequencies. This is a problem with many LCD TV's and monitors with built-in speakers, so watch out in general. It's tempting because the smaller speakers make the TV look so much more compact; but there's a trade-off. We returned it and are now looking at a Magnavox, Sylvania, or Sharp. We have actually been going into some stores to demo them, and have been turning down the sound in all the other TV's in the display so they don't interfere with the sound in the TV we're reviewing. I think there must be a bunch of annoyed salespeople out there who can't figure out why the sound is down in all the TV's in their display :)"
1,Polaroid TV,The TV sound kept going off. I contacted the seller and they made is a very easy return-no problems. Would have really liked the TV if the sound would have worked.
2,"Wow, How Do They Sell This Thing?","Hi,I'll keep this short and sweet. I won this HDTV as a raffle prize at a banquet. I didn't need it but decided it would be nice to have a TV in the office. It operated for exactly two days before the thing 'popped' and the picture disappeared. I had nowhere to return it to so I called Polaroid for warranty work and they basically said ""Too bad, so sad. Tough luck."" I tried a few places to get it fixed, but it was nowhere near worth what it would it cost to fix, so I tossed it in the trash can. May it sit in a land fill forever, and may alien archeologists dig it up in a thousand years and see how crappy it was."
1,CAN'T EVEN GET ONE USE!!!,"Im sure liike me you will be wanting you 9 dollars back as soon as you view the product.I did use the intire bottle in one use ,and I didn't even cover all of my hair.I figured it was just because the product was so good thats why it was so small,yet it was so EXPENSIVE!!!!!But that was not the case. For $2.50 You can buy aphogee and it works better and has MANY more uses.DO NOT BUY THIS EVER EVER EVER!!!!!I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS EVERRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Beginning of new series!!!,"After having read and enjoyed Beyond the Sea of Ice, Corridor of Storms, Forbidden Land and Walkers of the Wind, I was looking forward to reading the continuation of The First Americans series. After having read the first 110 pages of Sacred Stones last night, I am wondering what became of the cast of the first four novels. I think that it should be pointed out that the following books are not directly continuing the earlier books. I am enjoying them, but I hope to find out what happened in between the ages that the story skips."
4,Sarabande Books,"This, too, was purchased for a library and for a particular customer. this client liked the book very much and others patrons are checking it out. it is great to be able to purchase books in this way."
1,The Sacred Stones,"I read the previous 3 books by this author and found them intriguing. There was a certain level of gore and cruelty that sickened me, but I could get through it. However, Sacred Stones begins immediately with the sacrifice of a young virgin girl named Ahnee. William Sarabande develops her characters so well that the reader immediately relates to their plight, feels their pain and confusion and suffers slowly through their demise. I stopped reading the book after Ahnee's horrible and painful death. She was only 12 years old. I won't continue to read an author that describes in vivid detail the murders and cruel rapes performed slowly and viciously on unsuspecting children. Ugh...!"
3,Repitition,"lacked enough variety from the Mitford Series and it was hard to find recipes, prayers, which I'd like to make into index cards"
3,"Not Jim Carrey-ish, but amusing for an evening...","This book is a cute description of how a father attempts to coach his son's little league team while trying to a) not show favoritism to his son, who insists on copying a major leaguer's batting stance that makes him strike out; b) deal with outfielders who would rather collect worms and eat ice cream than play ball; c) decide whether to fire his drill sargeant assitant coach; d) handle rabid mothers determined that their son's team should win; and e) become the season champ without losing his mind!This book is a quick read, and has some insightful comments on the behavior of adults who are supposed to be the 'responsible' ones in the world of Little League. It's not a masterpiece, that's for sure, but I got more than a few chuckles. If anyone has ever played t-ball as a child, or watched his younger sibling's Little League game, then that person will certainly be able to identify with this book."
4,Pure 80's Pop at it Best!,"If you want the best of Go West, then get this CD. Every song on it is a pop masterpiece. Everything they released after this is bland in comparison."
5,Great cd! !,"Enjoyed them in the 80's (remember Pretty Woman soundtrack, they were on there?), on vinyl and I look forward to hearing this on cd!"
3,Everything about ADO.NET but...,"May be it is just me. This book is every thing about ADO.NET but not much about Internet or atleast not what I expected to find. There are thorough examples and topics covering every aspect of ADO.NET, so if you are beginner and wants to get up and running with ADO.NET - then this book is definitely for you.But if you intermediate to expert and have been using ADO.NET or and looking for something more to see what you might be missing then you may be disappointed. The author could have done much better by covering some more advanced topics and may even show a way to build a killer application using ADO.NET techniques."
4,Keep it in balance,This a good book but I think the author goes a little nuts with datasets. Datasets are not the best solution for every situtation.
2,"Okay, but there are better books on ADO.NET","This book is okay, but I was more interested in C#. I also have the Mastering C# Database Programming book from Sybex, which is much better in my opinion - but check it out for yourself :)"
1,It's Ok,Sweatshirt faded in the first wash and the band around the bottom of the sweatshirt is extremely small and doesn't match the actual size of the sweatshirt. Lettering is already starting to crack after one wash. Won't be wearing the sweatshirt. Money down the drain.
4,A Stunning Collection of Guitar Instrumentals,"I have been a long-time fan of solo guitar music: John Fahey, Michael Hedges, Adrian Legg, Preston Reed, Robbie Basho, but Leo Kottke is my favorite. From 1969's ""6- And 12-String Guitar"" to 1999's ""One Guitar, No Vocals,"" Kottke has released a series of stunning guitar albums. ""Guitar Music"" was his third all-instrumental outting. I first bought this on LP in 1981, and just now picked it up on CD for a low price from Amazon.com's Bargain Music Dept. Kottke's playing, as always, is spectacular. Whether it's his slide playing on ""Part Two,"" the fingerpicking on the gorgeous ""Side One Suite,"" or the haunting arrangement of ""Sleep Walk,"" Kottke is a master guitar player. All of Kottke's albums are terrific and this is one of his best. RECOMMENDED"
4,Pure Kottke.,"Even if ""Guitar Music"" isn't Kottke's Opus one in ingenuity, he newer fails to leave one breathless with admiration.Kottke is the masters mentor when it comes to playing the lute but I miss his raspy vocals."
1,Annoying.,"Jong-Fast&#65533;s characters lack finesse and depth. Subject matter is pathetic: an immature and superficial portrayal of drug addiction that is loosely and haphazardly used as filler content (roughly illustrated vomit and nosebleed scenes) between the more detailed descriptions of what Chanel or Prada outfit Miranda has decided to wear. The subject of HIV and AIDS is carelessly addressed for a modern-day tale, seen only as a stigma and source of gossip for Miranda and her needle-sharing friends. I felt little emotion while reading this novel. No sympathy invoked for this normal-girl-wannabe."
3,So-so teenage STUFF,"That's mainly what this book is.....STUFF. A bunch of STUFF clumped together to form a choppy story about a mixed-up druggie. Anything original or eye-opening? Not really. The dialogue moves fast and so does the book. It's an easy read that doesn't make much of an impression. I suggest reading ""Little New York Ba-tard"" by M. Dylan Raskin if you want a clear, angry social commentary."
2,Dissapointing,"I know that one should never approach a book with preconceptions, but I thought this book would be fun, possibly meaningful or sad... Sadly, it just was.The story is uninspiring, the characters are flat, which may show their shallowness (they just see each other as flat) or maybe they were just supposed to support a zany and hillarious plot that never materialized. They didn't do either. I was bored. The book was predicatble and the end was poorly executed."
1,You need this book like you need a kick in the head,"Poor Molly Jong-Fast. This book was under a media microscope before she even finished it. Nevertheless it is a poor excuse for a novel. One wonders if perhaps her editor was too afraid of illiciting a relapse to critique her. In its simplest terms this book has zero plot and the characters are just plain annoying. Some of Jong-Fast's observations are amusing, but most are trite. Maybe if she went to college...or finished high school (has she?) she might have something more interesting to write about."
1,"Live Fast, Die Jong","Oh, the pain of being young, rich and privileged in Manhattan. Trashy skimpy selfabsorbed ""fiction"" from a famous writer's kid. Don't waste your time like I did."
4,NORMAL GIRL... NOT!!,Definatly a great book. I read this back when it first came out. I picked it up in the library and re-read it. Great read for a beach or rainy day. Miranda would be a fun friend to have but not on her down time. Excellent Read!!
2,"Not so normal, at least for me","This book was just ok. I read it and had no problem getting through it, but there was just no true driving force or plot behind it. Actually, I dont think there were even any substantial characters behind it either. The main character, along with all of the others she encounters along the way, seem extremely flat and I didn't really care about what happened to her in the context of the story. For me it was interesting to read about a life full of drugs and such but I am positive there are other books out there that will give me the same effect but leave a more lasting impression. Another problem, I just couldn't identify with anything the character experienced or was talking about. Maybe it would have been more wrenching if I were a rich, (...)teenager from New York who had a massive drug problem."
2,I've Certainly Read Better,"""Normal Girl"" by Molly Jong-Fast isn't what you would call a masterpiece. I found it to be very lacking in many vital areas. For one, I didn't really like the characters. And, when you don't like the characters you certainly are starting behind the eight ball. And, second, I found the storyline to be tired and overused. I don't think that it was as intense as I had been lead to believe and it certainly didn't hold my interest or appeal to love of a good novel. I can't really recommend this one very much. There were a few moments that I lost myself and was interested but, they didn't string together enough to warrant more than 2 stars. Sorry, but true."
2,What a waste...,"This book came highly recommended by several of my friends, but I have to say that I was thoroughly unimpressed with the story. It was funny, but the humor, at times seemed forced. It started out with some really great imagery - good description and development, but as I got about halfway through the novel, I knew that this book would disappoint me. Near the end of the book it seemed that the author just ""dropped the ball"" on the plot. The character that we had learned about in such great detail through the beginning of the book was suddenly whisked through rehab in a matter of a few pages. It seemed as if she had been rushed to finish the book or something. I found the whole rehab thing very unrealistic. This book was a waste of time."
4,Anything but Ordinary,"I loved Miranda. Her voice truely represents the younger generation of today. We have everything, and we want more. All screwed up on drugs and going to twenty funerals a month. The young and the depressed. Okay, maybe I'm exagerating about us, but not about Miranda. Normal Girl was great to read just to make you appreciate your own life a bit more. Also a good reminder for kids to stay off drugs."
2,Generation X Angst,"This is a book which may go over well with the teenagers, but if you are looking for maturity of thought and artistry of language, keep looking."
1,"Yeah, okay, whatever.","To give Jong-Fast her due, Normal Girl is a remarkable achievement for a twenty-one year old. Having said that, I don't believe this book would ever have been published if it wasn't for Jong-Fast's literary connections.While she shows moments of great talent and promise, Bret Easton Ellis she ain't. Not yet anyway.Aside from the shallow and cliched story-line though, the worst aspect of the book is the appalling editing. Take the last sentence in the book for example:Because I'm off into the daylight. .'What sort of punctuation is that? There were missing and misspelled words throughout the whole book (and I'm not talking about American spelling standards such as 'center' instead 'centre'). I had to re-read a lot of sentences.By the end of the book, I wondered why I should care about it when it was quite clear that the writer, editor, agent, publisher and anyone else involved in the production of it, didn't."
1,GO ASK WHO?,"The main character of this book is Miranda . . . a shallow, rude, over-indulged, self-absorbed, self-loathing ""wanna be"" who should have read GO ASK ALICE. Literature . . . not."
1,the perks of having famous parents,"This book would never have been published had it been written by an unknown author, or, I should say, an author with unknown parents. The characters are completely unlikeable and utterly boring. I found myself hoping the protagonist would die an embarrassing death. Normal Girl makes Less Than Zero seem like Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man."
2,Normal Girl isn't Normal at all.,When I first heard about this book I was interested to read this book and thought it would be a quick and intersting book. I was wrong.. well it was a quick read but interesting that it was not.The charactors in this book have no depth or life to them. Well besides there rampate drug usage and partying. Miranda was a whining 19 year old girl.There was no real plot for this book. It just went from one end to the other and back again. The story line could have better if there was more depth to it but I just don't think it would have made the book any better.I had to force myself to finish the book after putting it down. Overall I hope that this author picks another subject to write on and possibly puts some more time into it.I can't really say I would give this book to anyone.
1,at least it was a quick read,this is the book for people who like to read about how to find veins to shoot your herion and how when your friend vomits 2xs on your couch it is time to buy a new one. spoiled rich druggy brat. This is the basic story.
5,A must-read,"The book is interesting and fun, one that I just could not put down. Even if you are not a big fan of reading, this one is sure to please you as the young authour's writing style and tone is informal and reads as if you're really inside Miranda Woke's head. Enjoyable to the last word! Give it a read, you will not be disappointed."
2,poorly written,"i was looking for something to read and my sister had this book, i finished it yesterday. It was pretty poorly written...the characters were very underdeveloped and it was very repetitive and at times boring. It seems like she goes into detail in all the areas you dont care about and lacks information and detail in all of the parts that you want to know more about...i would have rather spent my time reading something else...oh well..."
5,Quilt Savvy Rocks!!!,"This is an excellent Quilter's resource!! Clear concise explanations. Beautiful photography demonstrating technique, and Diane Gaudynski's friendly down to earth attitude make this book a joy to read."
5,Great Little Guide Book,The designs that Diane presents in the book are certainly worth trying and practicing until they're perfect. This book is for the machine quilter who uses a domestic sewing machine.
4,Gaudynski Knows Her Stuff,"Gaudynski's illustrations are clear, large, and easily followed. Although this is not an an ""Instant Mastery"" or beginning machine-quilter's book--if you plan to perfect the craft of machine quilting--Quilt Savvy can get you on your way, teaching you quilting moves you didn't realize you could do with an ordinary sewing machine, and take you well beyond the average quilter. It is well-written and beautifully illustrated."
2,Not what I was expecting,"I have Harriet Hargraves machine quilting book and its been a standard text book for me for years. I recently read Karen McTavishes whitework book and absolutely LOVED it. I purchased this book thinking it would round out my collection. This is an OK book, but nothing compared to the 2 others"
3,"Had to buy the book, bcuz professor gave hw from this","The book is OK. You need to have additional books such as book by Rutherford Aris of ""vectors, tensors and the basic eqn of fluid mechanics"" to completely understand. The objective of why to read this chapter or application of the equations are not mentioned, which makes it very difficult to use it as a reference book.I had to buy this book, because my professor was giving homework from this book. Otherwise, go for better books"
2,Not a good buy,"I bought this textbook for a graduate course in fluid mechanics. Generally, the book does a terrible job of presenting material. Subjects do not seem to have a consistent flow and I often found myself turning to alternate information sources in order to understand the topic being presented.Amazon however shipped very quickly as always and packaging was great."
3,Decent Flow Reference,"This book does a nice job of presenting the basic ideas of incompressible flow, but does not have any examples for the problems. It has a very weak treatment of simple flows, but does a sufficiently good job of mathematically supporting each concept. Not the best book, but good enough for undergraduate/introductory courses."
4,Smooth and Fast,The Voodoo 3 2000 is a great card. It delivers smooth and graphics and allows you to play those games that you can't usually play games on. Games like Quake 3. This card is a must buy for those looking for a good graphics card.
3,Very inspirational and motivating,"This book was printed in the 19th centruy and distributed to the entire Russian and the entire Japanese army. Because of this the book was the most printed in the 19th century! It tells of a Lt. in the US Army in 1898 who responded to the President's call for a courier to deliver a message to Garcia, the leader of the anti-Spanish frces in Cuba. The Message was delivered with no hesitation or any further questions asked of the President or the Staff. As a result Spain was pushed out of Cuba and Cuba became independent. U.S. also got the territories of the Philipines, Guam, Puerto Rico, etc. The book marvels at the dedication to duty of the Lt. and his abililty to complete the task --no matter what the circumstances."
5,The Greatest Country-Rock Album Ever,"The Gram Parsons-led Byrds was a much different outfit than the original group, which is still my favorite incarnation of the Byrds. However (with a boldfaced, 32-point capital ""H""), this album is quite simply fantastic in its own right. It is quite simply the best country-rock album ever made, in my opinion, and that is saying a lot. From the opening strains of Dylan's ""You Ain't Goin' Nowhere,"" you know you're in for a great treat. No ringing electric 12-string Rickenbackers, just timeless country harmonies sung with great vision and enthusiasm."
3,Speaking as a Byrds fan.....,".....I've always found this album over-rated. It lacks the polish of their other LPs and much of it sounds like a bunch of warm-ups, though the 2 Dylan songs, Parsons' ""One Hundred Years from Now"" and ""Hickory Wind"" plus the Chris Hillman-sung ""Blue Canadian Rockies"" are all worth the price of admission.On the subject of the bonus cuts, apart from ""Lazy Days"", ""Pretty Polly"" and ""Reputation"", these ARE NOT the alternate Gram Parsons vocal masters (these, including ""You Don't Miss Your Water"" can only be found on THE BYRDS box) but are rehearsal run-throughs only (this is all too apparent on the bonus ""One Hundred Years...""). Shame this, as it makes it the only one of the Columbia Byrds re-issues NOT to feature all the most essential contemporary non-LP cuts amongst its bonus selections."
1,Nothing good to say or really bad but...,If you like older style country music with newer voicings you may like this - Personally I did not even find one song worth keeping
4,Transitional Byrds,"Once again, the Byrds are in a state of transition. Too bad they were not to last much longer in this guise, for many reasons. The price is right and the listening is mellow. A top 20 group/personnel of the era."
4,The Byrds' Great Country Rock Album!,"Well, by the time that the Byrds recorded this album, Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman were the only two members left. So, they decided to pull in country rock maestro, Gram Parsons. Predictably, The Byrds went for country sound this time. This gamble would somehow alienate the Byrds purists. The folky and psychedelic feeling of early Byrds sounds are gone. If you want to listen to jangle sound of Roger's 12-string, you are out of luck.. This album is fill with slide and steel guitar. However, this album has some significance.. It combines folk and country."
2,case missing,the cd was in good condition but it was shipped without the cd case. it was just the cd and the insert. not too pleased with that.
3,Heretic!,"I thought this album was overrated when it first was reviewed.It is ok, there is nothing that is really bad, and the songs are first rate although the singing isn't. Tex McQuinn never cut it for me.The problem was there was so much great country music especially in 1968 who needed this band? This was a golden age of Buck Owens, Merle Haggard, Johnny Cash, Bill Monroe and many others.I must admit the Byrds are much better than many of the pseudo country bands of today."
1,3 of these are mislabeled!!!!!,"The case says the Byrds, but the cd inside is Mahavishnu Orchestra. All three that I ordered were like this!!!!!! Buyers beware!!!!!!"
5,Young Buck very good album .,"Young Buck very good album . Guest apperance by 50 cent,,Lil flip,david Banner,The game , Ludacris,Lloyd banks,D-tay,and stat quo. Good track like I'm a soldier,and more.I would this album 3 out of 5."
3,3 and a half stars,"It's a great album, having only a couple songs i wouldn't call great. But hits like Prices on my head, Look at Me Now, Let Me in, and Shorty Wanna Ride are what make you want to buy this album. Each one of those songs have great beats. So is most every song on this album, Young Buck from G-Units Debut 'Straight Outta Ca$hville' is a hit. 3 and a half stars, overall."
4,This CD is Hot,"Yo,, This CD is Hot... Probely the Best CD to come out from G UNIT so far... i definitly recomend it to everybody... it is worth buying 4 sure"
3,Young Buck,"Of all the G-Unit offerings so far, unfortunately this is the worst. I'm not going into details because I didn't like this album enough to give it more than a few listen throughs, but the only points where the album really picks up are where Buck doesn't have to do a whole song by himself (Bonafide Hustler, Prices on My Head, Welcome to the South), but the beat on ""Thou Shalt Not"" saves that song...other than that, I wasn't overly impressed by this record."
4,great album,This album is hot and g-unit is still blazing. almost every track is great. favorite is probablt stomp. its hot!!
3,This album is SOLID...BUT,"From a guy who likes to think he knows what hes talkin about..This debut from youngbuck is solid..i like 96.7%of it..but make no mistake, the lot of this album you can tell why hes the last man on the roster of G-Unit..No hate, its an honor making cd's with these people and he sounds great, but the best tracks on the CD you find his G-Unit counterparts and youd think they were their tracks..This track is not as good as Lloyd Banks debut..anyone who truly knows what there sayin would agree..but young buck is tight and i love this album..worth the money..and definatly one of the top teir albums of the year..nice job young buck..work a little harder and beat the sophmore jitters..your good 4 out of 5 and im stuck on pac so a 4 is real good..buy it whatever..u gotta have this for a tight collection."
5,Buck is Better than Banks,"Young Buck's solo debut album is the best Young Buck I've ever heard. He picked up his game. Spittin some hard lyrics and shovin it down our throughts. This album is good from beginning to end. I was never really a fan of Young Buck, but this album definitley changed my mind."
3,Cool,"When G-Unit was first introduced, I paid no attention to Young Buck. But with the introduction to his first video, I realized who he was and appreciated his stage presence and his energy. Overall, I believe he can rap. I like the fact that he explains his point of view without being just flat-out ignorant. But this cd sounds like something I've heard a million times before. I love ""Ride With Me"" to death via video (Pauly Shore is pure entertainment) and I like to see Young Buck visually, but in my car, I'm just not excited. I won't say the cd is bad--it's just the regular old I-got-a-gun-I'm-not-scared-of-you-I-lived-a-hard-life tale that I've heard millions of times before and am growing very tired of. BUT LUDACRIS'S VERSE ON ""STOMP"" IS PHENOMENAL. I love T.I.'s rapping style, but Ludacris? Whew. I had to pop my collar FOR him on that verse.P.S. As usual, the beats are five stars...but look who he's with? I expected nothing less."
5,HOT!!!!!!!!,Young buck is like the rest of g unit but in away he is much better. Young buck has a southern rap style mixed with NY style rap. Straight outta cashville has some of the hottest beats and lyrics i ever heard. The hotttest 3 songs on the ablum are:1.Welcome 2 the south(This is my favorite song because it has a real hot beat.)2.Let Me In(Good hit single)3.Shorty wanna RideYoung Buck is the best in g unit. Get this CD!
5,GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG-unit ..COp this album,"yo yall making bad reviews are just saying that because your fans of the game (aka the lame person that cant write his own lyrics)this album is great and no matter what the haters say yall should cop this album i like the hits like ""how do you like me now , Stomp , Bonifie hustla ft.50 and yayo and bang bang those are the hoteest tracks all the rest are great to get this album"
1,Southern crap,This is nothing but crap from the southern replacement of Yayo.Everything from the south sucks except Outkast & Goodie Mob before Cee-Lo left.And the fact that I'm from the south makes me ashamed of my own group.Now I know how Cubans feel.
3,This cd's pretty good but not as good as 50 cent or lloyd,"This is a pretty nice first cd for Buck, but i cant really compare it to some of 50 cents and Banks. Some of the lyrics were pretty good and some were garbage. I liked Stomp and loved Let me In."
3,fight 4 number one,Good ablum expected more but good. Anyone who says that buck's cd is better than banks album is a full on liar i can't tell the truth about banks. buck is tha worst member of g-unit but not saying he sucks just needs 2 work on his game.
3,Cool CD,"Over all, this is a cool, not great, but not bad either. The best songs on the album are, : let me in, shorty wanna ride, welcome to the south (it beats in the ride), and stomp (original with T.I). The rest of the songs are ok."
3,p-unit,check out a real hip hop artist like afroman. his disc jambs. join the streetteam on his website. truly be a part of his records. we need your help
2,What,"Yo i was so mad when i got this crap- there are only about 2 songs on the album that are strait-i mean how many rappers are going to rap about blowing weed and doing hoes. i dont get it. this aint a album this a mixtape to me, and southern rappers SUCK! SCARFACE,T.I., AND THEM DUDES SUCK AND YOUNG BUCK IS NO DIFFERENT.G-Unit can do so much better and get rid of buck and they will be fine, southern rappers suck and so do Buck, He Has no Vocab and he lyrics are basic, i mean i like vanilla ice better then this dude"
1,Why every one likes this garbage ?,"I quess every one is on buck's d*ck now huh ?I heard the album and its a piece of crap and yall dont know true hip hop or rap for that matter if you give Young buck's ""straight outta ca$hville"" good reviews...Its weak, bad production and bucks annoying voice along with his gay unit friendz. Ain no good real ""rapper"" outa of g unit. They all fake nu ggaz!"
5,DONT MAKE ME F*CK U UP,"MAN I LOVE NUMBA WON AND HUSTLERS MOTAVATION I THINK.AND SHORTY WANNA RIDE.. YOUNGY YOU DOINNG YA THANGBANKS IS JEALOUS BECAUSE OF THE HITS YOU MAKEIM A XHAMP CUZ I SHAKE AN BAKETHAT CAKE ,I MADE A MISTAKEDID YOUR HOMEY SAID STEAK CUZ I WONT HESITATET WAIT IMA CAPE WITH AN APE LIKE KING KONG\I LOVE GIRLS IN THONGS. IT RING BELLSIM A CHAMP LIKE Y.B HE GONNA GO TO HELL. IM JUST KIDDING I HAVE NO IDEAHE MAYBE NICE ANDDOPE BUT THEIRS ALL EYES ON HI M LIKE A MICROSCOPE"
1,WHAT IS THIS,Young Buck is just another example of how low rap and hip hop have sunk...Im just glad Talib Kwelis new LP came out and Mos Def is releasing his new LP in october...anyways I dont see how anyone could buy this crap its soooo generic all mainstream hip hop/rap is sounding the same it all sucks...if you look underground youll find real Hip Hop soo yea dont pick this crap up your wasting your mopney wait for Mos new album and pick that up pick something up that isnt just about shooting and bein a gangster its soooo pathetic..peace \\//
2,G-Unit style.Pleez...,"G-Unit,yeah do you know 50 cent's group?Well,after Loyd Banks' ""Hunger For More"",certified as great album for the great number of club-bangers,Young Buck drops his solo cd.I'm sorry,but if you think that this is a classic,YOU ARE ON THE WRONG WAY!The story doesn't change:Buck thinks to be a thug,and what can he swear behind huge necklesses and militar trousers?Monotone structure,50 Cent appairs on every track almost.Just like ""The Hunger For More"".We want another sound,a sound that can refresh our ears...WE CAN'T WAIT JUST A MASTA ACE OR A KANYE WEST!!!Buck's rhymes are similar to crunk's rhymes,but I don't want identify this rapper as a Ludacris' fake.He got talent but he doesn't use it!Too much 50 infulence.MY OPINION,ya.If you want buy a REAL hip-hop album,don't look at ""Straight Outta Ca$hville"".Therer are many cds..."
5,This Is A Classic,Young Buck is the king of the south and the only other person is either t.i. or ludacris but your boy buck killed it with this album keep doing your thang you and the rest of g-unit.GGGGG-UnitTop Songs1)Bang Bang2)Prices On My Head3)Look At Me Now4)Bonafide HustlerBlack Gloves
4,A Bride for Lord Beaumont,"Roslyn Andrews is engaged. Jonathan may not be the love of her life, but she cares for him, and he will take care of her father's financial difficulties. Miles, Lord Beaumont, is the man she has loved since childhood, but somehow, their relationship has never led to marriage. Miles loves Roslyn, but an ugly secret prevents expression of his feelings. There are many madcap scenes in this novel, and humor is used refreshingly often. Though sometimes the focus of the story becomes scattered among too many characters, the charm of the writing makes for an entertaining night's read."
5,I love John Denver's debut album!!,"I especially liked Leaving On A Jet Plane! I grew up with John Denver's music. I especially liked his album An Evening With John Denver which I have on record, cassette and CD!! My cousin Russell went to that concert and was in the front row!! You will hear him as one of the loudest cheering people in the crowd on that album!!"
3,Not too strong,This is his first solo album after the Mitchell Trio. He is in fine voice but the song selection is a little weak.
3,"John's First album: nice, but lacking maturity","John Denver: Rhymes & Reasons (1969/2005 CD - with 2 bonus tracks)This is an enjoyable album but (being his first solo album) John had yet to learn how to project his songs and his persona. This is the album that contains his original version of ""Leaving, On a Jet Plane"" and so this is an important album to have (for the John Denver fan). However, it must be said that the Peter, Paul & Mary Hit version of that song is certainly superior to John's own. The two bonus tracks (`Rusty Green' and `Take Me to Tomorrow') are superior to some of the tracks that made it to the original album and so they are welcome additions. Overall, the album lacks any real energy (even `folk' energy).As much as I love many of his later albums, this one is just `ok', so I can only give it Three Stars (3 )."
5,rhymes and reasons,"this album was johns first solo album after leaving the Chad mitchel Trio. Many people would know john as a country singer well, this couldnt be further away from it. my personal favorite on this album is ""I wish i knew how it would feel to be free"", a song i have heard Jools holland and Nina simone sing but with not near as much heart as this JD version. Also the dreamy ""circus"" and ""catch another butterfly"" and the beetles tune ""when i'm 64"". all superb. Another gem is ""love of the common people"". For any JD fan this is a must at any cost."
3,Good Album,This is a good early album for John Denver when he first came to the public's attention as a solo artist. Some tracks come across a little pretentious but this needs to be included in any JD collection.
4,Officially A Peep,"I want to give this album a 5 Star rating, but I'm a bit prudish, and some of the lyrics here are down right sick. Fetishes with dead girls? Yeiks, as beautiful as the song is, ""Julia"", is just too close to my name. Johnny Goudie is an awesome vocalist, and makes up for it with his cherry on top ""When will you be mine"". The most beautiful (and normal) song on the album -- Around and 'round he goes, hypnotising you with each phrase. Baby Hello, is definatley the best song on the album. All about phone sex ""but with someone you love"" says Johnny (of course). My next favourites would be ""Sugar Daddy"", and ""Buy Me"". Both excellent!! Conclusion: Take a peep! ... Go on ... You know you want to ;o)"
3,Scarlet Suprises,"A Study in Scarlet is the first Sherlock Holmes book written by Arthur Conan Doyle. It begins by having Holmes and Watson meet for the first time and work on their first case together (or rather, Holmes does all of the work as he usually does) The book is divided into two parts, the first is how Holmes perceives the crime (a murder) and finally catches the killer. The second part is a flashback as the killer relates what his motives were and why he carried them out. The first part entices the reader, and I read it straight through. However, the second part drags on and seems a bit unbelievable (the killer was so obsessed with killing that he travelled from America to Europe as his last dying effort to instruct justice). Although its not my favortite Sherlock Holmes book, it opened the doors for the great dective and his sidekick to share many more adventures together."
5,Love it!,"Finally, sunblock for your head that doesn't make a greasy, smelly mess. I've tried other ""oil free sunblock sprays"" and they all leave a greasy residue (I guess oil free and grease free are not the same thing). As someone with thinning hair and fair skin, this is the stuff I've been waiting for."
4,It's good stuff!,"This is a good low SPF sunscreen. It doubles as an after-shave, because it smells so good to me. Subtile and refreshing. I just wish that they would increase the SPF to 30."
4,DCS World is now the engine,"I purchased this for flight Sim entertainment and the company industry has grown.Now the best is yet to come. DCS World, with DLC purchasing separate modules of aircraft to start the series off is the P51D Mustang, including A10C, KA50, and a new element ion sandbox modern warfare gaming Combined Arms. Now you can control vehicles, i.e tanks, AA guns, artillery etc.soon more aircraft released and Navel combat![...]"
4,Awesome Air to Ground Action,"The sound engine is wretched, there's an array of weapons and sensor bugs for the fast movers, and there's no dynamic campaign, but I don't care about any of that. I just like jumping into a mud mover and blowing stuff up. And it's the prettiest flight simulator out there bar none, even without all of the terrain and environment mods from the dedicated community. Sometimes I just like to tour around and look at the scenery. The forthcoming 2.0 update will give the engine an overhaul and make it online compatible with DCS Black Shark. Ground pounder heaven."
3,It has starforce CD check but makes Lockon look better,"This game has the starforce DRM which installs on your computer and will check for the CD every time you fire it up. It does make the scenery in lockon look better. It doesn't do anything to fix the 'clunkiness' of the Lockon interface. I still don't get keyboard responses read appropriately at times (which is the same as the original Lockon). I mainly bought this as most Lockon addons require this to be installed, as I'm not interested in the new plane at all."
4,A decent companion to the Matador series,"It's been some years since I read this one, but it seems a shame to leave a good book with no reviews, so please forgive any errors of memory:The Omega Cage is the story of the prison escape alluded to in Perry's more recent novel, Brother Death. It follows a prisoner in the Confed's most secure prison (called, not surprisingly, the Omega Cage). With the help of the warden's albino sex slave, he escapes the prison and makes his way off planet using some interesting alien technology.The pace of the novel is reasonably fast, but because of the prison setting, much of the action is not as brisk as most of Perry's novels."
3,Good,"It is a good dictionary, but the slang I found in spanish is not necesarily what we use in this side if the world. Some expressions are very unfamiliar to me. On the other hand, the english part is very complete, and the expressions are very well explained."
2,"Same Stuff, Different DVD","This is the third DVD with the same jokes. I love Katt Williams, but I'm getting tired of new DVDs coming out with old material. We've all seen this before. You don't watch a comedian because of interviews he does in the back of a limo or interactions with the public, you watch a comedian to here their jokes. This is a ploy to make money and not a sincere effort to give the fans something new. He could have put all of the interview stuff on YouTube, but he wouldn't have made any money from it. Very disappointing."
2,Dissapointing,More of a documentary than his stand up show. Old clips with lots of katt talking in between.
2,Pimpadelic...,"I was on Amazon and saw that Katt Williams had come out with a new DVD. So like any other fan would do, I got excited, went and purchased it. I messed around, viewed the DVD and sadly, I'm very disappointed! He recycled the same ol' jokes that he has been using for years with a little bit of alteration but they are still the same. He is in front of an audience, from 2005 in Washington D.C. It looks like a comedy house of some sort and not only are the jokes tired but the entire video is too. The only difference with this video is he has commentary while he is riding in a limo, which still is not worth the purchase of this DVD. If you are a Katt Williams fan, like myself, don't waste your money on this DVD. It's been a minute since he has released something and I figured he would have come up with some new stuff but as soon as it started I said to myself....SAME OL' MATERIAL! I hope this helps.... YMMV. NEOSOUL"
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"When I received an email stating Katt had a ""NEW"" DVD to be released, I got excited. I just viewed this DVD last night and sadly, I'm disappointed. If you are a Katt fan like myself, don't waste your time purchasing this DVD. The same jokes about your kids, smoking w33d, etc. The only difference is the arena and his attire. Outside of that, SAME MATERIAL.SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!"
1,Buyer Beware,"I was very disappointed in this DVD. Mainly, because I am a fan of Katt Williams he is hilarious but, the usuage of the recycled jokes from Pimp Chronicles on here was a huge turn off. I might as well bought that again than Pimpadelic. I was so upset that I WILL NOT purchase NOTHING else from KATT WILLIAMS unless I review his new material from end to end to make sure he didn't stiff me again fro $20 bucks. I'm like Man, Katt... Its a recession. You can't be doing folks like that bruh.I hope this review was straight to the point and useful.Have a good one."
1,Recycled 3 times over,"I will be very hesitant before buying any Katt Williams product in the future. ""Katt Williams Live"" was fabulous, and I recommend it. However, that material made up about 80% of ""The Pimp Chronicles Part 1"" and now about 95% of ""Pimpadelic"". Borrow a friend's copy or Blockbuster/Netflix it for a buck, even though this product is worth less than that.This is a clear case of someone making/taking money by putting an old product in a new wrapper.Katt, doing your fans wrongly is not wise and will cost you in the long run.Amazon won't allow leaving zero stars for this piece of junk."
1,Re-Used,"Ok so I love Katt Williams, and I can say line by line with him for ""Pimpin Pimpin"" ""Pimp Chronicals"" and ""American Hustle"" but ""Live"" i wasn't very fond of, and neither am I with ""Pimpadelic"" He used the same jokes that could be found in ALL of his other dvd's. He is a very funny man, but he doesn't have any new lines. I am very sorry that I even wasted my money on this DVD. If you already own the first three I listed of his dvd's then do NOT buy this one too, you will be disappointed."
2,it's not standup it's a documentary,More of him driving around trying to preach than there was standup. Go with his other video It's Pimpin Pimpin. That was very funny. I would have changed the chaneel on this video if i hadn't paid for the rental.
1,Save Your Money,This a old DVD from 2005 new release my but same old material. Are you the hard up to make more money that your reselling old material.
2,SHAWN MICHAELS LAST MATCH IN THE WWF.,WHAT MADE SHAWN LEAVE THE WWF.BECAUSE OF HIS BACK OR WAS IT BECAUSE OF MONEY AND GLORY.OR OR OR WHAT HAPPEN BACK IN 1997 WITH BRET HITMAN HART AND THE UNDERTAKER.I DO NOT KNOW WHY? BUT SHAWN MICHAELS IS ONE MY FAVORITE WRESTLIES OF ALL TIME.TO WRESTLEMANIA 14 THE SHOW WAS BORING AND STUPID.BUT BUT BUT THE MAIN EVENT WAS ENTERTAINING WITH STONE COLD WINNING THE WWF TITLE. PS RENT IT.
3,the dumpster match was money,"catcus jack terry funk vs new age outlawthis match is near my favorite hardcore matches it was innovative and exciting the only thing is it was a little short i feel this match is slightly overlooked because of hbk and scsa match as mainevent both two teams work well against eachother i wish there was a rematch between the two teams in another hardcore gimmmick perhaps a hiac in either case they used ladders, chairs, obviously dumpsters, and large plastic soda bottles i know they used more weapons but i forget i admire the conclusion of the match as it was very creative with funk driving a folklift to pick up the new age outlaws and put them into the dumpster to win the match if this was five minutes longer this would have probably been a tag team version of hhh vs catcus jack at the royal rumble 2000 it was close though i rate ***3/4 to very close **** star match"
5,WWF Wrestlemania XIV,"Absolutely unbelievable! The greatest wrestling card I've seen in my life. Features stellar performances from every worker in the company - most notably Sable, Hunter and Austin. Shawn Michaels MUST be applauded for the determination and courage he portrayed in his match with Stone Cold, in the face of a serious back injury. Indeed the ""showstopper"" and Austin produced one hell of an exciting match. Not forgetting Tyson of course! This definitely is the pinnacle of sports entertainment. END"
4,very good,I THINK THIS MOVIE WAS A VERY GOOD WRESTLING MOVIE. I LOVED THE DUMPSTERMATCH BETWEEN THE NEW AGE OUTLAWS ANDCACTUS JACK AND CHAINSAW CHARLIE. I AM GOING TO BUY THIS MOVIE IN ABOUT A MONTH BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A GREAT MOVIE.
2,WAY Under Average!!!!!!!!,"This horrible ppv had to be the worst of 1998. The tag battle royal sucked, the rock vs shamrock match sucked, and the main event pretty much sucked. The only reason I gave the tape 2 stars was because of the 5 star Dumpster Match."
4,WRESTLEMANIA XIV-SIMPLY ONE OF THE BEST,"The timing was just right. The WWF had held its fourteenth WrestleMania with great results. Stone Cold Steve Austin took the gold away from Shawn Michaels in the main event, the Undertaker battled his brother Kane, and it was the night that would change the WWF for years to come. Truly a classic."
5,Extraordinary!,"I usually read in the evening to help me fall asleep. I actually lost sleep over this one. The characters were so real they followed me into the next day's mood. The 'loved it' or 'hated it' reviews were telling. Turner let us get to know the characters without having to load us up with description and history. Those who need all sweetness and light and require everything spelled out for them will not like this book, nor will southern Bap-Diss. I will be reading her other works soon."
4,Nancy E. Turner Knows How to Make Characters Come Alive,I have loved Nancy E. Turners other books and this one is another winner. Her character development is superb and she takes you back to another time and place with great descriptions and and an interesting plot. A very good read.
4,A glimpse into our past,"Nancy E. Turner does a great job of revealing the real-life hardships of post-depression East Texas, as well as the bigotry faced by the blacks and the poor. I thoroughly enjoyed the characterizations, but, as a Texan, I wish she had studied Texas geography a little closer. Turner is a great author and has a way of really getting to the core of her characters."
5,"Great read, wonderful characters",Nancy E Turner does not disappoint in this wonderful historical fiction set during WWII when women worked in factories to keep their families going. The characters were so enjoyable and the story was a real page-turner. A great book at a great price.
4,Water & the Blood,Thanks for making book purchasing so easy. I haven't read this book yet & I am looking forward to doing so.
2,Great Paper - Inflated Pricing,"The paper is great product no complaints there, just frustration in the $5.00 small order charge plus shipping costs."
3,not very cinnamony,I was disappointed that the flavor of this was weak. It was touted as great cinnamon flavor but really tasted like all other sugarless mints and had that sugarless aftertaste.
1,"Pointless, full of typos and other errors","Do not waste your money on this, I only got it as a Kindle book because it was for free. Kaplan is bad at law school products (such as LSAT preparation), and this book is no exception. It's riddled with typos and other errors!"
4,Decent,"The information is relevant and helpful. A lot of the info about financing it seems somewhat common sense and can be found elsewhere, but this collates it all into one area.I haven't looked into alternatives, but I think this is decent."
4,Good Commentary,"This is a good commentary to read through as a study. It won't be very helpful for those wanting to dig into the text in great depth or analyze each Greek word. Kent does a great job with interpretation, though! I would recommend this for those who want to read a good study in the book on James."
1,There must be better DHTML books WITH examples...,"The author clearly needs to work on his delivery of information in the context of multiple intellligences. Face it, most of the ""crack the book"" learners on the Internet are a combination of the logical/mathematical and kinetic intelligences. So what makes this book so useless is the lack of examples to explain the author's points! Even after the author promises something in ""Part 2: The Project"" they never really appear, nor do any direct references to any code that might be on the associated website. Obviously, this book was rushed to print without good review, but the true hypocrisy comes on p. 24 when the author refers to involving the student's senses as a basic principle of teaching. Wherever that came from it's clear the author stuck with the old ""sage on the stage"" approach. Next time try ""guide on the side"" and involve the student with practical examples."
1,Very weak,The problem with this book is its lack of point. The author explains how he is designing a site for some company he tags as NWU. Why he doesn't just give his readers the address for the site atleast to give them an idea of DHTML in action I don't know? He has absolutely NO examples that are worth trying and the whole first couple of chapters are donated to the history of the web! I didn't spend my money to read about HTML's existence. I bought the book because I want to know DHTML. The capper for me was when I tried to download some source code from a site recomended at the back of the book. The site doesn't exist!
1,"Waste of money, this title is crap.","Sorry, I have to give 1 star because is the minimum. I bought this piece of crap looking for a starter book for DHTML... a waste of money, I don't know what this dudess was thinking at the time of writting, has no examples, is not clear, has lot of errors, tries to follow an entire project, but surely is only on her mind, there's no source code to follow..."
3,Not For Everyone,"This is a very interesting book. Interesting in the respect that it is a study of the Allied bomber offensive against Germany in WWII as seen through the eyes of the German commanders tasked with stoping those raids. The text is complied from numerous post-war interviews with and reports written by the German High Command. The original target audience of those reports was not the casual reader or mild history buff. As a result the text has a choppy flow and tends to be dry. It's a good book but a real niche book. If you're a student of WWII you may find it intriguing, if you're looking for a casual read or gripping stories of air warfare pass on this one."
3,WW II Allied Bomber Campaign from the German Side,"The book is a compilation of debriefs and reports from key Luftwaffe officers regarding the German air defenses against the Allied bombing campaign. The book is good research material for the professional or amateur historian. It is not a book I would recommend for a casual read. The translations from German are stilted and hard to understand. It takes a great deal of concentration to follow the story lines. There are a great many abbreviations used. While there is a glossary, it makes the reading difficult. However, for the historical reasearcher, it's a good source if you can wade through it."
5,Delicious,What a wonderful and engrossing story. I could not put it down. The characters were so interesting and so well drawn. I really wish I knew them. Highly recommended.
4,great book,one of the clicker training fundamentals. If you have never done it it is totally worth trying but I recommend working for at least 1 session with a trainer or watching demos on DVD (or even youtube) because timing and technique are everything and if you are off this can be ineffective or even counter productive. Once you get the general technique of marking behaviors and shaping and luring then books like this can be very helpful.
4,Clicking for your dog,This book is informative and easy to follow. There are tricks in it that you can easily train your dog to do. And with the techniques your dogs' tricks are only limited to your patience and imagination.Brant
5,The Book We've Been Waiting For!,"It took me five minutes of looking through ""Clicking with Your Dog"" to realize it's the book we've been dreaming of for our clients. Moments later we'd already ordered 100 copies.This book gets the average American started on the right foot with clicker training. It doesn't bog down the people who ""just want to know how to do it"" yet directs those of us who can't get enough to further information. It provides excellent guidance to children who are beginning to train and communicate with their dogs. I can only hope 4-H training groups will make it their manual.The majority of owners who come to see us for assistance with their pet's behavior problems leave with a clicker in their hand. Now they'll be leaving with a clicker in one hand and ""Clicking with Your Dog"" in the other hand."
4,A Great book for the Clicking Beginner!,"Peggy Tillman's book is a great starter book for someone who is new to clicker training. Tillman sets out her book in a very simple and easy to read fashion. If you're looking for a good book on the basics of clicker training, you could do a lot worse than to purchase this book.The only ""beef"" I have with this book is that sometimes it overdoes the simplicity. For example, the illustrations are almost too basic - they seem to be designed for a child! The idea of the illustrations seems to be that you don't have to read any of the book, rather you can just look at the pictures. However, with something like clicker training you really need to READ and understand the principles behind the training, not just look at pictures, so I think the book's intention sort of misses the mark.However, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to clicker beginners!"
3,don't give your dog raisins as imlied as a treat!!!!,First... there is an illustration in this book that shows raisens as a possible treat. Raisens and grapes are deadly for dogs! After nearly losing a golden...only saved through great vet care and luck I want all to know this......That said...I love the book and can only assume error was made in bad edditing.
3,Good intro to clicker work; but NO to raisins and grapes!,"""Clicking With Your Dog"" is a fairly good introduction to using a clicker to train. It will give beginning handlers a good grasp of the ""how-to's"". All the basics that most pet owners want to teach their dogs are covered. I got it for my niece (12 years old) to start working with her puppy and she did well with it.The only problem that I have with the book is that the author suggests using raisins or grapes as training treats--no click and treat for her! Grapes and raisins are highly suspected of causing kidney failure in dogs, especially with the amount that a dog would eat during a training session."
2,So so...,Easy to read. Pretty Pics...but I thought it was a waste of my money. Have gotten better ideas from one magazine than this entire book. Go to the library to check it out & save your money.
5,Works like a charm,Well I bought this remote control for one of my camera's for my front door. And I have had it working perfect for the past 2 years with no problems. Money well spent
1,"Terrible product, do not buy!","I bought PurrScriptions plus the other day to use on my 5-year-old calico, Betsy. Within an hour of application, she began acting very lethargic (which is not like her at all -- she's a very vivacious cat) so I looked up reviews of other Sentry flea/tick products and read a lot of very unsettling reviews from customers. I felt horrible about giving my cat this ""treatment"" that poisoned her.Luckily, I ran across advice to wash the treated area with dish soap... and even though I ended up badly scratched, my cat is doing a lot better.Please don't buy this product. It's cheap, but it doesn't do the job, and may even kill your pet."
2,Not worh reading,"Did not care for the story, very hard read. Had no idea what the story line would be but had I known I would not have purchased it."
3,Imaginative Concepts but Not Well Executed,"A reasonably imaginative and competently written SF novel. What would happen if aliens came to Earth with evidence of the existence of God? This is the point of departure of a novel incorporating the fate and purpose of the universe, commentary on the nature of religion, the trajectory of civilizations, and human confrontation with mortality.While this is generally entertaining and Sawyer's ideas are often ingenious, there is simply too much packed into this book. The quality of plotting and characterization is simply inadequate to support the ambitious agenda of ideas. Its telling, for example, that Sawyer's hero, a human paleontologist, is less interesting than one of the alien characters. High marks for concept, low marks for execution."
4,physics better than metaphysics,"I enjoyed Rob's book, the first I've read by him. It gave me some interesting new insights and references on the issue of what science has to say about whether there is evidence of intelligent design of the universe. Rob is also often amusing, and I laughed out loud at a clever dig on William Shatner.Minor gripes: I found some of his conjectures obfuscating and contradictory, and the resolution of the story rather hokey. More significantly, Rob's perspective is clearly that of someone much better grounded in science than philosophy and theology. However, there's lots of interesting ideas in the book, and it makes a great point of departure for further discussion of the topic."
4,Science Dummies May Have Some Trouble,"Usually, I can squeak by in a Sawyer novel with the science. However, this one was beyond me at several points. Not helping was that the two lead characters, the paleontoligist and the alien, discuss some of these scientific points and a discussion of science was even harder for me to follow because of the inherent dry nature of such a presentation. Why do I give it 4 stars then? It's a brilliant book and the philosophy and religious issues, which I did fully understand, are so well handled. I would give it a 5 if I were not a science dummy myself. This is my only limitation with the sci-fi genre: if the science is too hard, that cuts into my total appreciation of a particular novel. Sawyer may have enough fans, however, who are not science dummies like moi. If he wants to widen his audience, however, he may have to make the science easier to understand. Nevertheless, he's still doing some of the most original writing found in fiction today of any sort."
2,"I really, really wanted to like this book","As I read Calculating God I was caught by what I thought was a gradual and slow build up to something grand and thought provoking. Unfortunately, the end of the book left a sour taste in my mouth. The ending fizzled without resolving the question that the author insisted on restating on every page, ""is there a god."" Although the book was well written (even though the last two chapters look like they were missed by the editor) once I finished I found myself not pondering the existance of a God, but why it took so many pages to say nothing.I have to say that the author has an enjoyable writing style and a good sense of humor...but the ending knocked all the stars out of my review."
1,aliens not so bright,"The book is disappointing. The lengthy beginning rehashes worn-out arguments for the existence of a creator. All are based on confusing a priori probability with a posteriori probability and it is surprising that presumably superior alien races could not come up with anything better nor they ever discovered the fallacy of such thinking. Why Sawyer never consulted any philosophy textbook? He would have found more intriguing ideas. The rest of the book is no better, i.e., spider-like aliens thinking and talking like humans and such."
3,mixed reaction,"Sawyer attempts to find a balance between intelligent design and evolution--it works somewhat. There is little plot here, merely a series of conversation, without convincing. The God here is the God of the philosophers. There is also a problem of the first person narration which concludes beyond our own time. A good read, but lacks it the looking back."
5,Good read,"Don't know how I missed Rob Sawyer in the past but I'm catching up now. He tread that close line between science and fiction with out going too far either way, makes for a good read."
2,Not worth the money,"While this book provided an interesting concept, and gave some interesting options for the eternal debate on the existence of a god, it simply wasn't well-written enough to hold my interest. It was a struggle to finish reading the book, which is not normally the case for me. The science, in general, seemed relatively accurate. I'd wait for it in paperback if you must read it, or get it from your local library. It's not worth taking up valuable book-shelf space in your home."
2,Sorry,"I hate to do this since I love this writer but this book was mediocre. Some interesting ideas but not particularly original. Most of the book feels like an aside, a discussion or rumination on some concept or other, with little relation to the story. I live in Toronto, so the location was interesting, although slightly embarrassing (typical Canadian response). Going back to re-read Starplex or Flashforward..."
4,Interesting Novel,"""Calculating God"" is a very interesting novel. It brings suspence, excitement and curiosity to the viewer. When i found out that the main character Tom Jerico has a deadly disease i felt for him. i like this book especially cause im from Toronto and when he starts describing toronto and the subway station i new it. it was interesting to read it. But i was disapointed in the ending. Also some of his scientific parts were rather boring and complex. So for the simple minded person. It might be hard to read. But overall a great novel!"
1,Not a Good Book,"The premise is interesting, but the narrative is poor, most of the characters are weakly drawn, and the dialog is forced. Overall, not a book I would recommend"
2,big let-down,"The concept for this book is fantastic - a wonderful idea, with several neat twists. However, I found the actual plot enormously disappointing. Without giving too much away, suffice to say that the concept largely recedes as the author spends most of the book using the science-fiction ""hook"" as a veneer for discussing his thoughts on Issues Of the Day (""what would the inhabitants of Omicron Beta III think about abortion?""). Furthermore the book requires that you feel that Canadians are so utterly phlegmatic that the daily presence of an Alien in their midst, after a few days, is treated largely with a shrug - no extra security for the alien, no extra recording/monitoring/vetting of the conversations with the alien, etc.I don't want to sound like too much of a fussbudget, but those two were just too much for me to swallow - more emphasis on the essential concept and a lot less on the gassing about public policy would have made this a great book."
2,"Well-written, but muddled thinking","I have to respectfully disagree with some other reviewers regarding this book. The author attempts to achieve balance, but simply ends up presenting many differing points of view, some of which are obviously flawed, logically or theologically inconsistent, and simply not worthy of our attention. (No, I'm not talking about the actions of the fundamentalists.) For example, one of the first dialogues with Hallus is a clear example of applying the anthropic (hmm, probably not the best term in this case) principle to science in an inappropriate manner: [Human]life has a purpose, life entails certain antecedent conditions, those conditions must have existed by design, ""design"" entails a designer, and therefore there is a designer who has a purpose for life. A bit tautological and unworthy of an ""advanced"" race.The book is well-written, however, and the characters are great."
4,Sawyer delivers with Big Ideas,"Very well thought out book. Sawyer is very convincing, and his main character, Tom Jericho, is nicely done. All the characters in this book were well done, with the exceptions of Hollus, who didn't strike me as alien enough, and the two creation extremists, who seemed extraneous.This book is well paced and nicely plotted. Recommended."
3,A good read if you ignore a couple of unrealistic episodes,"I loved the start of the book, where the alien makes first contact by asking a museum security guard for directions. That was the hook that kept me reading. The book intelligently discusses some new (to me) ideas on intelligent design and the existence of a god. The idea that evidence for a creator might someday come from science itself is thought provoking. I was annoyed however with the extraneous subplot with the creationist terrorists and the book's ending where it reaches for an entirely unnecessary crescendo. Sometimes SF books try to answer so many big questions that none of them are addressed adequately. I wish the author had given more space to the questions about how intelligent life comes about and where it leads. The book takes the protagonist's hypothesis for these questions as facts without giving any proofs."
4,Great beginning,"Amazing opening and its whimsical tone is marvellous. Highly original and profound. My on problem, I would confess, was as others have said, that it creates too much of an expectation and I wander if any ending would be satisfying. Still, it is well worth reading."
2,Not very good.,"Other reviewers have done a fine job in discussing the problems with the logic in this book - although I would add that the book does make what I presume is an unintentional argument against creationism/intelligent design, i.e., the only way either hypothesis could be proven would be by demonstrating facts which are simply not extant.The story itself reads like bad young-adult fiction - the premise is good, but the world inside the book feels like a school play on a mostly-empty stage.This book will almost certainly be embraced and bought in massive quantaties by the religious book-club crowd, and indeed, my version has a set of book-club discussion questions in the back. Publishing it was probably a pretty savvy move. Writing it will probably prove lucrative for the author. However, it definitely has some bottom-of-the-barrel arguments."
2,"Too much going on, too hard to read","Got this for my 11 year old son for Christmas, and made him so frustrated. Looks great, has cool appeal to it,the bezel is giant- but when it comes down to it, the months are near impossible to read.The grids are distracting. The rotating face blocks the hour and or the minutes. It seems this is a ""night sky guide"" with no way of getting it lit in the dark to see where to turn the bezel. As a compass? Well,if you were lost in the daylight...good luck since the watch is made as a night time constellation guide. He wants to send this back asap. Might be cool for a student studying the sky, but not for a kid, who thought this could be a cool and useful tool."
2,I am disappoint.,"Was cool, really. I thought it was, anyway. But yeah, it sucks. The clock is kind of off, the planishpere thing sucks too. If you really want to know what's in the sky, there's an app for that DROID phone where you can point it to the sky and it'll tell you which stars/planets/celestial bodies are. Way neater than this. Don't bother buying this unless you have cash to spend and want to check this out.Honestly, I just gave this away instead of throwing it away."
1,They don't work...period.,"These things were such a great idea. Execution was not so good. They can barely grind salt or pepper and when completely full, the turn upside-down when stuck to the fridge. Sometimes they even migrate south on the fridge when full and I end up chasing the dog around the house with a salt grinder in her mouth. Cute but useless."
4,Audioquest HDMI,"This model is excellent for Blu Ray player duty. Much better than generic cables, especially for HD viewing. I bought this for about $30; don't pay more than $50 for it, IMHO."
3,Quality but Expensive,This is a good cable but as others have said here I think you can save money with a cheaper cable without sacrificing a large amount of quality.
1,"If you pay more than[..]for an HDMI cable, you are mad!","Digital signals are a series of 1s and 0s. There is no quality to a 1 or a 0. It gets through or it doesn't. If it does you get your picture in all its glory, If it doesn't, you don't. Any HDMI compliant cable will get your 1s and 0s through - otherwise it would not be HDMI compliant. The only exception is very long cable runs but that is not an issue 99% of the time. Most cable runs will be below 15 feet.Don't fall for the cable hype rubbish that makes manufacturers and dealers a fortune.America, you've been ripped-off enough!!!!"
3,"Scratch, Scratch","I named this review ""Scratch, Scratch"" because I think that is what it made my head do. I only used it twice so I am not sure if it was this product that actually did it, but I did notice my head started itching...not right after, but probably at least after 30 minutes of using it. I believe I need to give it one more go and pay more attention to when or if I actually start itching. Let my clarify, I didn't feel like I was itching my brains out but it was the kind of feeling like my scalp was dry."
1,This has nothing to do with...,"You sent me this as a recommendation because I have ordered many books about Africa. This book has nothing to do with Africa, or the country of Togo, of course. Someone needs to pay a little more attention!I tried to find another link to let you know about this, but never found any way on the site to actually contact Amazon, so I am doing it this way."
5,That book touched me.,"I just finished the great failure. That book touched me in so many ways. I sat in the motorhome yesterday, while ed was driving, sobbing over her description of the death of her father. I think the thing I love about all of her books so far is the level of connection I have with her life. She manages to describe me without knowing me or my circumstances."
1,"Goldberg's latest, very disappointing","The first clue to the value of this book, the reader notices, is the scarcity of content -- the wide margins, the large print, and the scant pages. The writer's timidity stems from the paucity of her message. Someday Ms. Goldberg will look back on this book and ask, ""Why didn't somebody stop me?"" Surely it represents a period of spiritual and psychological crisis. Surely we will see again the bright, talented seeker after Truth that we loved in ""quiet highway."" Surely, roshi's message and his dedication to the dharma live on. Yes, he was flesh and blood as are we all."
2,"No ""Long Quiet Highway""","I was shocked by this book. Not by the revelations regarding her father or her teacher, but by Goldberg's portrayal of her own narcissism and immaturity. Goldberg wants us to see her as a victim, but I came away feeling pity for her parents, her teacher, her sister, and the audience who paid good money to hear her self-aggrandizing presentation. The best part of this book, and the only reason I gave it two stars, is because of the Zen Koan that Goldberg weaves throughout her memoir. Otherwise, this book is another ""Great Failure."""
2,Self-indulgent: What Have We Learned?,"I have liked Natalie Goldberg since ""Writing Down the Bones"", but listening (after having read, years ago) to the audio version of ""Long Quiet Highway"" then reading this, I feel as though these memoirs are mostly self-indulgent and though she's looking in a mirror, she cannot accurately relate what she sees."
3,Unfulfilled expectations....,"Goldberg's previous books treated us to an enchanting narrative of her experiences with Zen and life in general via her witty and insightful pen style. This book also addresses the same topics yet somehow fails to supply the enchantment; the experiences seem, as yet, to be undigested by the author and so the narrative comes off more like a transcript of what one might tell one's therapist or a friend over tea (as in complaining about one's troubles in life!). It is my hope that once digested Natalie might someday be able to offer some insight into how one can deal with such disappointments and unfulfilled expectations we have of others so as to provide the readers with a little teaching along with the psychology notes. As it stands, this book is a bit of an unfulfilled expectation as well."
4,"Not judgmental, not whiny","I first read Long Quiet Highway against my better judgement years ago. I was smitten before I realized it and ended up reading everything of hers I could. I love the way she grounds all her writing in tiny details of the world. It's so loving and joyful and real.The title should have clued me in. 'The Great Failure'. By the second page I realized it wasn't what I'd signed up for. We were going to be uncomfortable, we were going to be angry, and we weren't going to hide it behind anything. There is a sense of loss that seeps from the pages right into you. The book unfolds as a very honest quest: how to deal with betrayal from people you loved and looked up to, when they didn't ever mean to betray you. How can you come to terms with you own sense of love and loyalty towards people who injured you. And how can it be released if it has to hidden?This is not a judgemental book. It is very human."
3,zinc,I bought this for the zinc and vit. D for my little ones. They take it but I notice it had soy in it so they can no longer take it. So I do! The taste is okay>>> Would I buy again I would have to say no because of the Soy and my children are allergic to that!
3,review for SC cooler,I love this cooler. I own one myself and I gave one as a gift. There is only one bad thing about this bag. It is very durable so if you over stuff it can get very heavy.
4,i love this album,"I think ""Brown Eyed Girl"" is a great pop radio hit, but my favorite song on the album is ""TB Sheets"". Probably Van Morrison's all time best song, ""TB Sheets"" is about how Van watches his girlfriend die from tuberculosis and all the feelings that go through his mind at that time. This song is very personal to me because I've had a similar event happen to me in the past few days."
1,i hate it,"this album is worse than lame, the lyrics are horrendous, the singer is too pretentious, what a mistake I made"
4,Works great!,I've not much to say besides that these work well and the cost is great. We buy these about once a year for a pack of 12 and I have no complaints.
5,A great read. Incredibly helpful for anyone who's expecting.,Easy to read. Very informative and well written. I enjoyed it immensely.
2,Made me worry.,"Reading this book made me very nervous about everything. After reading this you may worry that everything you do will hurt your baby or mess them up when they grow up. Pregnant women have enough to worry about. If I could turn back time, I wouldn't have purchased this."
5,He has done it again,"I was worried after so many months passed and Z-Ro hadn't released anything. I have to say that it was well worth the wait. Z-Ro has made another classic cd--something you can listen to from beginning to end. If you are a faithful Ro fan, you cannot pass up this cd. Owning it is a MUST."
1,Not for the Weak of Hand,"The operative word for this frying pan is HEAVY. The weight would be a problem for those who are arthritic or for those who prefer medium-weight cookware. However, it is a ""quality"" product, as is everything made by Le Creuset. Imported from France where chefs have the reputation for beign choosy about their cookware."
3,High in weight and quality,"This pan is heavy, like most other Le Crueset products but it has the best non-stick surface I have ever seen. We use it frequently and the surface has not shown any signs of deterioration. The only complaint I have is that heat is transferred to the handle making it untouchable without a mitt."
1,Le Creuset is wonderful but not their non stick items!,"I love, love, love, love my Le Creuset, so imagine my disappointment when this lovely pan flaked so very easily. As far as non-stick pans go, next time I'll stick with the cheap Wal-Mart pans instead. Now for everything else, Le Creuset just can't be beat. They should really stick to making the enameled pans."
2,flaked off,I loved my pan for the evenness in cooking but the coating started flaking off too. I never put it in the dishwasher and now I really want to buy another pan but I am hesitant due to the same problem happening again.
5,Great pan!,This was a great buy -- it's easy to use and wash. It also is a compact size -- great for the single guy or gal who'd like to fry eggs before shuffling off to work.
2,Short Circuited,At first I happy with this product... but on my third use it short circuited and stopped working. For the cheap price I wasnt expecting it to last forever but I did expect it to last longer than 3 uses. I would suggest maybe getting a back up or getting a more durable one.
4,Good workable,"The only issue I have with this item is the connection to the camera is a bit akward, the end piece points to the back and can get in the way of handeling the camera. But works good, I took multi exposures at a time during fireworks and it did great"
2,Remote switch not as good as OEM but worth the price.,"It feels light and insubstantial but have had no problem making it work. The tolerances are not as good as you would expect from Canon nor is the fit or finish. Cheaply made. In short, this is not as good as the original Canon remote switch but is worth the price if it holds up."
1,Doesn't work with Canon 7D.,"Although it says it works with the 7D, it wouldn't work with mine. I don't know if the unit is defective or isn't advertised correctly, but even with all the AF and timer settings as they should be, the release does nothing. After doing some more research, I am getting the Opteka R-4, since it's compatible, wireless, and cheaper."
1,A Piece Of S#!+,"A simple device, which should allow you to press the button, and the shutter of you camera should trigger. When you are out in the field, though, and you wiggle the connector, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, and you jiggle the button, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, and you shake the cable, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, the switch ends up looking like this:[...]I'm thinking you might have a better place to put your money."
3,"cheaply made, but totally functional","Works just as advertised with the Canon 5DmkII. Downside is that it feels light and flimsy in the hand, the up side is it works. You'll just want to try to be carefully with it, as it feels like it'll break easily if dropped, etc.."
2,Cheap.,I have a Canon 40D. It doesn't work. Plus the chord is too short and feels very cheap. It probably isn't that durable. I regret purchasing it.
3,Works... for now,"This remote switch feels incredibly cheap. The switch has three positions: half-pressed, full pressed, and locked. The half-pressed position is barely perceptible.All that said, it has been working so far.As a side benefit, it appears to have a 2mm jack on the side for connecting with some other form of remote. I haven't verified that this works."
4,"amazing collection from the 50 , 60 and 70ties.","Its a big collection of classic bondage photos. Quality of the photos could be better, but I like it a lot."
5,Great read!,"Witty and insightful, Kyle Lake's Understanding God's Will is a must read for those seeking a fresh, honest approach to discovering what God desires in our lives. Lake skillfully navigates the reader through the trite formulas and truisms that have dominated- and dumbed down- the pursuit of God's will, replacing them with holistic, workable metaphors that inspire the reader to seek God with the whole of their lives."
2,"Not bad, but not great....for me","I enjoyed Lake's sermons when we would stop in for a visit, but his writing is like reading the mind of a 16 year old with ADA. I couldn't follow his thoughts. Then again maybe I'm too old to understand his jargon. When your finished reading this, please pray for is wife and kids."
4,Good for Specialty Labels,"Allows me to make labels that are not available elsewhere. Good product, however due to large size of each sheet, there can be wrinkles in a sheet. Recommended."
4,Inside the Criminal Mind,The book is very good. It is especially true for anyone to read that is on probation for an offense that is required to be read and a report to be written for group treatment. This is part of the treatment that is for people with any kind of offense.
4,EYE-OPENING,Thank goodness we are all entitled to our own opinion. I read the original publication of Inside the Criminal Mind. It was a real eye-opener for me. I have worked in several prisons and believe Stanton Samenow is very accurate. We--as well as criminals--need to stop blaming society for criminal behavior.
2,Samenow review..,"We used this book in my forensic psychology class. In groups, we were assigned chapters to read and analyze. We then had to give a presentation on why Samenow is a complete idiot. Although some of his theories sound legitimate, the only support he gives are stories. He has no real evidence for any of his ideas. We were able to pull apart his work and find concrete evidence against almost everything he says. He also contradicts himself throughout the entire book. Hopefully you aren't reading this book for facts.."
4,Helpful but not complete,"This book will give you some insight into how criminals think. It basically comes down to ""criminal commit crimes because they want to."" If you work with offenders or ex-offenders, this book is helpful but incomplete. Read some of the work by Chuck Colson and Prison Fellowship."
3,Understanding the Criminal Mind,"The book gives case studies of individuals in prison, and an overview into many popular ideas about the criminal mind. It debunks the theory that your family, your genetics, society, or other outside forces creates a criminal. It holds responsible the self actions of the criminal who is looking for thrills and excitement and proposes an intensive program that can help criminal in prison to begin to change their mind set so that they can function in a free society as contributing members."
1,Balderdash,"Even this updated book is obsolete.Stanton seems to be burned out. He ignores medical science and Medical Doctors who just started practicing Addiction Medicine in July of 2012.Genetics and enviornment play a big role.Like Adam Lanza who killed 20 6 years olds, 6 teachers and his mom.Samenow would say he was havin fun and just evil. That kind of opinion compounds the violence we are expererincing at a all time high in the U S A.Samenow doesn't sound like he has an ounce of compassion and border lines on sociopathic in my experience as a former criminal who has worked with many criminal.Medical treatment and support as early as possible will reduce the 34 murders that happen daily in the U S A. We have averaged 10,000 a year for years.I believe we have finally hit bottom after 20 6 years olds and their teacher and Lanza Mother being killed.With friends like Samenow this country doesn't need any enemies.Michael AudleyOverland Park,Ks"
1,Unenlightening,"The question what makes one person a criminal and the next a law abiding citizen is as old as the hills, and probably most people would agree with the common sense approach that it depends on a variety of factors, such as genetics, upbringing, poverty, social environment. Therefore, it is somewhat irritating for an amateur in the field (such as I) to pick up a book (such as Samenow's) only to find out that ""the experts"" seem to be locked in a heated reductionist battle, either putting the entire blame on society (the tree - hugging - liberal stance) or on the criminal himself (Samenow's position).Overall the book seems like a polemic statement in an unconstructive debate. You will like it if you have always tended towards more Victorian views, and if you are a liberal at heart then you quickly dismiss it as the outgrowth of Reaganism that it is. Either way, it is unlikely that anyone will garner any intellectual profit from it."
5,Outstanding - Should be Required Reading for all Cops,"Excellent book. I noiced that John Douglas, ex-FBI profiler and author of ""Mindhunter"" quotes him in his latest book."
4,Inside the Criminal Mind,"Very good reading with insight into how the criminals think and rationalize their behavior. The author also outlines various types of crimes and provides information on common criminal personality types. He shares examples of criminals he has evaluated and elaborates on errors professionals make in evaluating criminals. He also examines the implied factors behind what leads one to a life of crime. He seperates the common beliefs from his theory. I would recommend this for anyone who works with criminals or who wants to know more about what makes the criminal ""tick""."
4,tough love of america,"Nader's homely eloquence and un-airbrushed patriotism may not persuade those who blame him, rather than corrupt machinations in Florida and Washington, for the result of the 2000 campaign; but it will appeal to idealists both younger and older. Few unestablished authors could get away with his unsparing depiction of the hijacking of the Democratic Party by the DLC (the creation of one-time Democrats for Nixon) and by corporations that created 'prosperity' by what we now know as 'aggressive accounting'. He is one of the few national figures who still asserts that the message is more important than the messenger, and that democratic society can be rescued by action and involvement the populace. The dreadful maneuvers that excluded him from the ballot in seven states and from nationally televised debates with Gore & Bush could have produced a bitter book, but the book remains brightly optimistic, fed by the optimism and energy which he encountered on the campaign trail."
4,"Don't ""get"" the Nader appeal? This book makes it very clear.","Up front & honest, 'Crashing the Party' is Nader's personal take on his adventures during the 2000 election. The tricky & complex issue of media bias is explored as Ralph recounts specific encounters and situations w/ the press, and the ""Commission on Presidential Debates"" takes a well deserved beating.This is all Ralph's perspective, and the retelling of his personal experience may seem irrelevant to some, or vitally important to others."
5,CRASHING THE PARTY: HOW TO TELL THE TRUTH & STILL RUN FOR PR,Great account of the struggles as a independant running for the Presidency. Ralph Nader is a true American. A individual that cant be bought. In these trying times of gread and corruption we need this man in Goverment. This book should be required reading for high school goverment classes.
4,"Important story, but bumpy read","The take-home message of the book is essential for anyone interested in the current - and more importantly - the future of of American politics. Crashing the Party provides a wonderful opportunity to revisit Nader's position on countless items and juxtapose it with that of other liberals and the so-called democrats. The book reads as a cross between a diary, diatribe, and lessons learned report on how to run a campaign. While reading Nader's account of life on the road campaigning for the Green Party has mainly historical anecdotal value the book's real strength is the repeated illustration of the deplorable shortcomings of the current electoral system and the consequences for all of us. Nader's style is surprisingly lively, but increased editorial care and attention would have made the book an ever better read."
3,I just hope he runs again in 2004...,"""Crashing the Party"" chronicles the Nader campaign and details the many issues surrounding it. It is very interesting, particularly if you support Nader, or believe in progressive politics. However, you're not going to learn a tremendous amount about the issues.If you're even slightly curious about Nader, read this book. You'll find out what he's all about and will respect the man and his campaign..."
2,Disappointed,"My first hero wasn't an athlete or political figure or movie star. It was Nader. I've admired his integrity, his fortitude, and his values since I was a high school student.At 58, I still found him the most interesting of all the political candidates -- smart, bold, and filled with ideas. To listen to him is always to learn something.BUT. But somewhere along the line, Nader came to admire himself as much as I've admired him. This book is a name-dropping ego trip. He seems to have impressed himself that he ran for President. He reminds me of a kid showing off his diving skills with ""Hey, look at me."" Ralph, the campaign was a belly flop. Why write a book about it?We get a lot more of Nader selling himself in this book than we do of Nader selling his ideas. And that's a shame."
2,Not a party,Nader spends a good amount of time complaining about media coverage. The media kept focusing on the campaign rather than the issues. Nader's response? Write a book about the campaign rather than the issues. What a disappointment.
1,Too hard to read,"Small type, cluttered pages, white type dropped out of photos -- I got a headache trying to read this book. There may be good ideas here, but I'll never know. Unless your vision is 20/20 and you have a good reading lamp and magnifiers, skip it."
3,Ok story and a quick read.,The premise is good but the story becomes a bit unbelievable. The character does things that should have had him charged with desertion and he gets away with it. I'll reserve judgement on the series until I've read the second book.
1,not another pretender...,"Characters - not credible, not fully definedPlot - heavy reliance on coincidence and improbable outcomesI read 3.5 books in this series with increasing distaste and boredom. I didn't finish the fourth.Save your money and re-read your O'Brian, Parkinson, Woodman, and yes, even your Forrester."
2,Not ready for prime time,"Kydd, as a novel, rates an ""all right"", as a first novel perhaps a ""good"". But it definately is not great. The plot is very episotic, much like the Hornblowers that were written as short stories, but this book was supposed to hang together as a single work. Plot lines begin and end for no rational reason, and there is a healthy dose of coincedence in some of the escapes. Characters are thin, often bordering on stereotype. This book is not in the same league as the opther heavy hitters in the genre - don't look to Stockwin for the next O'Brian or Kent"
3,A slow moving book.,"Our protagonist, Thomas Kydd, is no Hornblower (thanks goodness!! -no long evenings at the whist table, melancholy reflections or regrets about marrying Maria); Kydd is a wig-maker who has the misfortune of meeting up with a press gang at he wrong time. Lonely, scared, and confused, Kydd slowly learns the culture of the crew and the workings of the ship. Unfortunately, the reader is just as confused. Not much really happens in the first part of the book and it's just not very interesting. I realize the author is setting the table for later books, but I'd like a few morsels to keep me going. Also, the book is heavy on dialogue, which takes some getting used to. Much jargon (not just nautical) and there are few speaker cues, which make the dialogue difficult to follow. I'll slog through another book or two in the hopes that it gets better."
2,Whetted but not satisfied,""" Tom Kydd"" has the potential to be a great character and series , but I found that when I finished the book I wanted more . That is ,I thought that it seem to take an eternity to set the scene then the book was finished .Stockwin needs to get plot developing very quickly or he will run the risk of the character becoming a comic. It was becoming a little tiresome that ""Tom"" seemed to always land on his feet and was ""naturally gifted' . Lets hope that he does not become like a character in a Wilbur Smith novel who can do everything or he wil be an admiral by the end of vol 2). Ill stick with it for one or two more installments but for me the jury is still out .Two and Half stars would be a fairer score"
4,Enlisted perspective,This is the first book that I have read during the time frame from the enlisted perspective. Stockwin's writing makes it easy to picture yourself right there beside Kydd. I enjoy Stockwin more then Patrick O'Brian but Alexander Kent (Douglas Reeman) is better. The one hard part I have swallowing is when he returns from being a deserter.
3,I enjoyed this story,"Mostly because it is so rare to see a novel set from the seamans point of view-it is usually told from the officer's perspective. I thought the character has some real potential, but I found some of the story line a bit implausible-and I also felt like there wasn't a real ending to it-all the sudden it was simply over.I plan to read the follow up to this one, and hope to see Kydd's character developed some more.Overall I found it an enjoyable read."
3,Toy target.,This item seems cheaply made. It is loose and floppy. The targets interfer with each other and fall down when they should not.
3,Not what I expected,"Not a bad little target. Emphasis on ""little"". It's much smaller than I anticipated. It works fairly well as a reactive target, but the individual targets do not stay in the up position very consistently. They usually swing up so hard that they bounce back down on their own. I have tried at various ranges out to 45 yards and with different types of ammo with virtually the same result. Seems sturdy enough though, and looks like they'll last a while. My Grandson likes them better than shooting paper. I'll probably look at something else when I buy another one."
2,"Little misleading, doesnt work great either","I don't see the point in having a reset arm if they dont stay up anyway. We had it mounted on flat ground. We couldn't stake it down so we used a steel beam which held it down firmly. Shot about 150-200 rounds at it and all of the paint came off.Again, at most you might get 2 arms up before they will all fall down. They aren't machined well, sometimes they will overlap or just flick sideways when you shoot em instead of flipping. The instructions were very small and confusing. Ended up figuring it out on my own.Overall, I like being able to see when I hit it, if it doesn't go up, it at least swings back amd forth. It definitely doesn't work as well as described. Not bad for $25. I would much rather have one of the $60-$80 trees but I bought a red dot sight instead."
2,Poor Design,After 3 shots all the roll pins fell out.Spend a few extra bucks and get a setup of higher quality!
3,Do-All .22 Auto Reset,"cant beat the price but the targets dont always flip up and stay and im not sure how long the roll pin spinner stops will hold up but for twenty bucks, not too bad."
3,Mostly satisfied,"The only complaint I have is that there was a small part missing, but my husband was able to use a couple of washers in it's place, and made it work. Otherwise, it looks like it's going to be lots of fun."
1,not good,Doesnt work very well will not reset tried adjusting cleaning different ranges and bullets built very well just doesnt work.
1,Breaks after first use,"Using Thunderbolt .22LR at about 25 yds... First time at the range, several roll pins came out. Called the company. They sent me only four extra roll pins and told me to use Loctite on them. Second time at the range a couple more came out, and I can't find matching roll pins at the local hardware store. Metal appears to be rather soft as well. Waste of money."
4,"Great product, just a little too small","Works great, just got mine yesterday and took it right out. Blasted it with a Smith & Wesson M&P 15-22 and a Walther P22. Only problem I have is that the targets are extremely small, very hard to hit, you have to be really good with your aim. At one time hitting a regular target resetted all of them. Other than than I'm satisfied and will use it till it dies."
1,"Waste of Money, falls apart after very first use.",I received this target for a gift after placing it on my Amazon wish list. It was easy to assemble. I placed it at 30 yards and shot it with a 10 round clip from my Rugar MK III Comp. It fell to pieces on the very first use. The pins used to keep it together were laying on the ground around it as the target arms fell to the ground. I took it to my shop and pushed them back in attempting to secure them a bit more than they had come. Once again I took it to the range and unloaded a clip. Once again it fell apart. COMPLETE JUNK.
4,Great product,Great product. We love it on the blow up mattress and in a hotel room. My only complaint is I thought we were getting two for that price and was a little disappointed when only one arrived in the mail. The pictures shows two and I feel it is somewhat deceiving.
1,Can't replace a true bed rail,I didn't have the same luck with this as everyone else did. My daughter kept slidding under this. I thank God she was only sleeping on a low bed because she fell out twice before I removed it. You need a lot of room in a bed for this to possibly work. It might work better if the middle was secured to the bed which is does not.I don't think I will use it again. It was a waste of money. And definately a risk for children in normal height beds.A portable bed rail is much safer.
3,It Comes With Only One!!!,This is a neat product and a neat idea but the packaging is deceiving. It states it is good for a double bed but why would you only need one bolster for a double bed? The photo shows two but it comes with only one for $40. Please take note of this!!!
4,BedBugz Bolsters are great!,"We recently went on a 19-day cross country road trip with our 2-1/2-year-old son. I purchased the Bed Bugz bolsters so that he could sleep in a regular hotel bed by himself without worrying that he would fall out. The bolsters stayed in place and were relatively easy to use. There is a bit involved with getting them blown up and deflated, but once you find the right spot, they inflate and deflate quickly.I would like to note that the bolsters I purchased stated that they would work for a bed up to full size. I found that they also worked on queen sized beds just fine.It would be nice if they came with a carry bag to travel with and store them in when not in use."
2,Not what expected,First off the product only comes with one rail/bolster so it does not work for a bed that is in the middle of the room/not against the wall. Second of all the bolsters are very soft and nice for children but they do roll and if your toddler is as active as mine you will find it can roll very easily and kids could fall off of the bed if they play too hard. It is a great idea but not for me.
2,Bed bolster,"It seemed like a good idea, however I have yet to get the thing inflated. I'm not giving up but I'm not happy."
3,Works well enough,"This bed bolster has worked pretty well, my 19 month old daughter isn't falling out of her convertible bed now that we have the bolster in. It's not as solid as a foam bolster, but that's not really a shock considering it's not solid foam.The only big complaint / concern I have is with the straps. There are two long elastic straps that could be a strangulation hazard, and one of the straps has a large heavy buckle on it.Probably would go with something else if we were buying again, but wouldn't return it."
5,Best Vacay Investment EVER!,"My 18 month old will not sleep with us in our bed, so when we travel, if she doesn't sleep in the pack-n-play, mommy gets NO sleep! We did this for a week in OBX, and when i came home, someone suggested this travel bumper.I ordered it for a week trip to Disney, and it saved me! Not only is is super secure and snug, but its just the perfect size to pack too! My husband blew it up, so i'm not sure how long it too, but I'll say minutes!The ease and peace of mind this gave me, made the trip so much more worth it b/c tired mommies and babies, don't make for a magical experience!"
4,Worked for us.,"We moved our daughter onto a full size bed when she was around 8 months old (makes for easier nursing during the night). We put her bed against the wall and used this on the open side. We put it on fairly tightly and put the elastic strap through the slats on the headboard and footboard of her bed (about 2 or 3 slats in from the edge). The elastic is fairly stretchy, but because we didn't put it right on the edge of the bed, but a few inches in, we never had a problem with it at all. Our daughter did figure out how to get around it eventually, but we had her bed very close to the floor and by the time she figured out how to get around it, she had absolutely no problem getting in and out of her bed...and much higher things for that matter. We really just wanted something to make sure she wouldn't accidentally fall out of bed and it worked well for us."
4,Works great for us,We have platform beds for our girls that won't work with a regular bed rail. These work great for both our full and twin beds. It could possibly hurt mattress by cinching it but we don't really have a good alternative.
3,Didn't work for us,"Although the bedbugz rail was very easy to inflate and install, it is not working for us. My son has fallen out of bed 3 or 4 times even with the bedrail, and we have it on VERY tight. Might not be because of some problem with the bedrail, we may just have too active of a sleeper but this isn't a fantastic item anyways. I have had to blow it up again 3 times in 2 weeks because it starts to deflate and it is plugged still."
5,Great idea!,"We took this on vacation with us and it was perfect for my 2 year old. I used it on a Queen size bed and it fit just fine. You don't need it to cover the full length of the bed, just the length of the child. I never had a problem with it coming loose. It was great to just take it out of the bag, blow it up and then deflate it at the end of the week to put back in the suitcase. I felt very sure that she would not fall out of the bed while I was in another room."
1,"Doesn't work, isn't safe","Slipped off the mattress no matter how tight I cinched it. Child can slip under, doesn't seem safe."
2,Not snug as a BedBugz,"My toddler removed this in less than a minute. Yes, the strap was a tight as I could make it. I am hoping to use it up against the wall to train her to stay in the middle of the bed. That may be the only way we end up using this. It's made well and , in theory, would seem to work but it's not for every toddler."
5,More usable information in 60 pages than most have in 600,"This book does not try to make you an expert backpacker, and therein lies its beauty. Harry Roberts knows that experience is the only route to expertise, so he only tells you enough to start getting experience. He doesn't confuse you with more information than you need, but he doesn't leave out anything important. As a result, this book has more usable information in 60 pages than most have in 600. He doesn't bore you with endless detail about gear brands and features (which will change next week anyhow.) Instead, he gives you a short, practical gear list and tips on what you do - and don't - need on the trail. If, like me, you're a recreational backpacker, this may well be the only book you'll ever need."
5,perfect Item perfect price,"This was just the book I needed and got it for less than half, of what it cost at the school"
3,GED study book,I needed this book to help my student study for her GED as it is the one that is used at her regular class. I tutor her through the local literacy council.
2,Not what I expected--a disappointment,"The author's command of language, and her writing skills are excellent, but the story was far from what I expected.It does give a good description of English life in the countryside in the 1800's. The characters are well drawn and seem very real, as does the atmosphere surrounding them.The problem is--nothing much happens in the way of plot.I had thought the book was going to be about this maid, Annie Phelan, and her employers, Eldon and Isabelle Dashell (a husband & wife)both becoming romantically interested in her to the point where her position in the household changes and she gains power over both of them. But this situation never fully develops. One kiss is exchanged between Isabelle and Annie and that is the extent of any romantic relationship between them.The book bogs down with dwelling on Isabelle's interest in photography and Eldon's interest in expeditions and map making."
3,Just OK,"I bought this to brush up on my French before traveling. At first glance, it appeared to be a good review. I would not consider this book for self-directed learning. You need to have some knowledge of how the words are pronounced as there is no guide along with the words, only a half page pronunciation guide at the front of the book. Having had very little experience with the French language, I did not find this very useful other than the topics covered."
5,good for tall,"Thankfully they make these in tall for guys like me who cannot stand regular t-shirts that shrink and become too short to tuck in after a few washes. After washing this shirt dozens of times, is still long enough for my liking. Recommended."
1,Huge,"These are crazy huge on my 6'2"" skinny husband. He normally fits perfectly into size medium, but his undershirts end up getting untucked. These were too big all over to wear at all and they don't shrink. The sleeves were so long it made him look like a child."
1,Garbage!!!,"Garbage- That is actually were they when after 6 months of use. Good luck finding a good quality tall men's shirt, I am still searching!!"
4,At t-shirt that stays tucked,"I have a long torso, so it's nice to have a t-shirt that stays tucked. With these I don't feel self-conscious about showing anything every time I sit in a folding chair with someone behind me. Wish they were cheaper."
3,Thin Fabric Best as an Undershirt,These t-shirts fit perfectly; nice and long lengthwise without be huge and baggy width wise. But the fabric is a pretty thin and light weight and you can see through it easily. If worn alone would show your nipples.
5,great for tall guys,"Tall hanes, what more can I say. Wish i could find them locally instead of needing to buy them online."
5,Great shirts!,"My husband prefers large tall shirts and these fit him wonderfully. If they aren't ""tall"" they aren't long enough for him."
5,Great fit,"I've gone through many undershirts over the years and they always suffer the same fate - shrinking. There's nothing worse (well, maybe cancer) than an undershirt that shrinks to the point where you can't tuck it in anymore. These shirts are extra long, and although they do shrink, they shrink just the right amount so that there is plenty of material left to tuck in. They are soft, and tagless, and just the right thickness for me. A will definitely order more."
1,"T-shirt fabric VERY thin, nearly transparent! For price, should be thicker fabric like shown in photos!","In the photos they appear to be a thicker material that is not transparent(standard t-shirt weight). These are probably the thinnest material/fabric t-shirts I have ever seen. No need for a wet t-shirt contest, these things are so thin they are nearly transparent. You can easily put a newspaper/magazine under them and read with no problem.For the cost, these should be made of better/thicker material. I would NOT buy these again."
4,Hard to find in stores,"Comfortable, and a great undershirt. Indicated it was 'tall' on the package, but not on the t shirt itself. Would definitely get more"
3,Less than expected,"I found these shirts to be rather thin and not nearly long enough. In fact, after washing and drying, they are the same size as my old shirts which are not tall sized."
4,Great for tall guys!,"As a tall (6'3"") guy, I've often had trouble with undershirts un-tucking throughout the day and becoming uncomfortable under my dress shirt, etc. These are a great, hard-to-find longer length version of the white undershirts I get at a store like Wal-Mart. They stay tucked in all day with no problems. My only complaint is I hate how a 2-pack is twice as much as I usually pay for a 5 pack! :/ It's worth it though to have at least one or two pairs of these on hand."
2,Still looking for a true tall T,"Pre-shrunk? Not so much. Only one of six shirts purchased in longer than 30"" and half are shorter than 28"". I'm only 6'2"" and have trouble keeping these tucked in. What do real tall guys do?"
1,Not tall at all,"I ordered (and paid more for) several packages of Hanes XL tall t-shirts. After one wash, these are not tall t-shirts. They are inches shorter than the equivalent shirt by Jockey. I will never buy the Hanes shirts again."
2,Doesn't really lay flat,"I bought this with high expectations since i have bought tons of Hanes t-shirts before, however the L/T (Large Tall) that I bought this time was quite disappointing because the collar doesn't lay flat after one wash. The length of the shirt was good though."
4,Nice,I like them. Nice feel. Fit well. (Have not shrunk like the Hanes V-neck t-shirts I bought on the same order.)
2,Shrank to normal length.,"These shirts shrank to a regular length after washing for the first time, so I would not recommend them. I tried these out and these:Tall Man Tag-Free Crew Neck T-Shirt- 2 Packto see which were going to be longer after laundering, and the Jockey ones are at least 3 inches longer and a slightly thicker and softer cotton."
5,Great T-Shirt,"I have trouble with most off-the-shelf t-shirts shrinking, becoming too short, and not staying tucked in. These t-shirts are definitely long enough that any shrinking should not affect their ability to stay tucked in underneath my dress shirts."
1,Defective shirt,"One of the T shirts I purchased was defective. It was improperly stitched in the shoulder, creating a gap in the seam."
3,Nice Shirts,The upside is these are true extra length shirts which in itself is awesome. The downside is these are too thin. They keep you cool but I just hope they don't develop holes or separation tears in a short period of time. Bottom line is they're cheap enough but I'll keep an eye out for thicker material. Give them a try though!
4,Nice Length!,"The shirts arrived in the typical packaging you see in the department stores. Nothing special there. However, the shirts are a little thin and slightly see-through. That's okay because I use them as undershirts, but if you're going to wear them out an about, you may want to watch out that you don't ""Janet Jackson"" anyone. The length on these shirts is perfect though! For a guy with a thicker waist-line the extra length really helps me stay tucked in all day."
1,Not Tall Enough,These T Shirts were a disappointment and are on their way to Goodwill. They weren't long enough to tuck in and stay down properly.
4,"Great fit, but could be a bit longer","I'm 6'6"" and so really wanted to get some undershirts that would stay tucked in all day. These are really just long enough to do so if you don't have to do any stretching during for high shelves and the like. If they had another 1"" in length, they'd be a 5 star rating."
1,Shrank to a no longer tall length...,"Purchased these XL Tall undershirts for my husband....the same size and brand he usually wears except these were also branded ""Classics"". After just one wash in a warm/cold cycle and dried on low they shrank and are now unwearable (for a tall man). The new shirts shrank to about 3 inches shorter than his other Hanes undershirts that are a bit worn out and have been through several washes. I bought 3 packages and now have 9 shirts going to our donation pile. The packaging said they were tall but on the inside label (printed on the shirt) it does not say tall at all. Not sure if these were miss-packaged or just pour quality."
3,size perfect too thin,"The tall size which is hard to find in the stores, is perfect; however, I wish the material was not so thin."
1,Shrinkage!,"Hanes' tees are comfortable. But since I paid more for the tall tees, and they shrank in length significantly after a couple washes, I have to give Hanes' tall tees a terrible review. I also noted that the lay-flat collar seems to not lay so flat after a few washes. I take the tees right out of the washer as soon as they are done and put them in the dryer, and when I remove them, the collars are wrinkled. When I put one on, they don't lay flat, they are rumpled.Edit 18 MAR 2012Be absolutely sure that you check the package you receive. Make certain that it says these are Tall tees on the front. I got shorted (literally) the last time I ordered these."
5,Great for my son in law,"My Son in Law is 6'8"" and it is hard to find tees to fit well... He likes the collar on these they lay flat. After washing there was minimal shrinkage. So far he is pleased with them.. nice cotton as well for the price."
2,wont purchase next time,"product was listed as 'tall', but when trying on this wasn't so 'tall'. seemed like a normal XL fit to me. also, noticed a small whole in seem at right shoulder by the end of my first day wearing."
4,Extra tall but good!,"T-shirts are made light and extra tall, being 6'4 they could be an inch shorter for me and still be long enough."
1,No version on any computer has ever worked for me.,"I've used the ""Doctor Sound"" feature (or whatever it was called, it never comes up again) to set everything, which it said my mic volume was ""good"". I could barely hear myself. I left it at that volume anyways, and the moment I went to the next screen, instant feedback. I've tried EVERY setting from headset/speakers to setting default audio device (and without). Even with the microphone UNPLUGGED it echoes the feedback forever.I've tried previous versions with similar results, I'd thought the new interface with this version meant they had changed something in the program. I guess not. It's still useless.See for yourself, go to their website and download the 6-day trial (they say 7 but it expires at the six 24-hour mark)."
1,Caused stability issues for Windows,"[Updated 1 December 2012]I received several negative comments. I am assuming these were from the manufacturer. Whether you *like* what I am saying or not, this is the honest experience I had. Folks would probably like to know about it.It seems like a great idea.The product theoretically allows you to do real-time voice modifications.I can imagine 1,001 useful applications of the software from improving your Tough Voice for a massive multi-player on-line persona to doing cartoons for kiddies.It was with great disappointment that I tried and failed to get this program to work on XP, Vista, and Win 7 systems.In the case of the XP and Vista system, I had to do a roll-back on the operating system when it became unstable after the installation.The concept is fantastic, but the product itself is shakey.I might be interested in future releases of the product, but the current version is definitely best avoided.In service,Rich"
1,Did not work,I bought this and it never worked. My computer would not read the disk. I returned it and did not buy another one. I will see if there is a version I can download instead
3,only for the fans,"I am a big Jazz fan, I like some of Duke Ellington big band stuff and I really like most of the small combo stuff I have heard him on. I got this as part of a larger boxed set (reviewed on my blog - click my name to see link to it in my profile). The idea is quite attractive - he covers theme tunes played by other big bands so we get to hear some Jazz Standards we are used to hearing from other bands played by Ellington. The result is rather boring and much weaker then the Dukes essential big band records. Even for big band fans this is an OK record but no more - as the Duke recorded so many great records I would pass on this one."
1,A Very Rushed Job,"This book is really short on detail and I kept asking myself where is the beef? Few details and facts are in the book and while the book may be timely, at least to some, it is not the kind of book that the avearge investor can learn from. The writing style is boring and too choppy for a enjoyable read. I was very disappointed!!!"
1,don't rush to do any of this,Ric still assumes you can get 10% on investments. Right. And your Enron retirement plan will keep you cozy until you're 99.
4,On the small side,"This target was purchased for our sons to use with their pellet guns. Once it arrived we noticed it was VERY small. So, this is now my husbands target and we purchased a larger one for the boys. Its a great target, but for someone who is a pretty accurate shot."
4,Do All Target Spinner,"Product is as expected. Is a bit small (not the manufactures fault) you get what you pay for. When I got tired of trying to shoot it with my iron sight AR, I used 12ga bird shot to see how it would take it. from around 30 yards it just took some of the paint off. I would buy again!"
3,Missing Parts,Product is smaller than I had anticipated...but that wasn't the bad part. It was missing the stickers for the target. I haven't been able to use it yet.
4,Good / Not Great,"This seems to work fine. I purchased two pieces of wood (1 inch by 1 inch by 2 feet) and drilled holes in it. Then, the target sits in the holes. That prevents it from falling over so much. But it seems to be pretty hardy if you stick to 22 cal. For the money, its pretty good."
4,Lots of fun for a great price,"This is a lot of fun. The construction is not incredibly sturdy, but for .22 targets it doesn't have to be. It sets up in seconds, and spins without binding.You do have to be careful to shoot the target straight-on, or the targets will bang into the adjacent targets, making them both spin.The model we got has 3 targets that decrease in size, so it is fun to try to get them all spinning, going from largest to smallest. It comes with a couple of sets of stickers, but they shoot off pretty quickly. Plan on repainting often, one afternoon of shooting knocked almost all the paint off of all 3 targets."
3,Nice until I broke it!,"3 Stars forPros:-Lightweight-Spins OK-Fun for an hour-Cool ""ping"" sound when shotCons:-I broke mine while putting into the ground. I usually use my foot on the middle bar to push down. One day, one of the welds broke and now need to be re-welded. Bummer-Not very durable (obviously)I might just use the spinners and weld something on my own time."
2,"Boring, the stickers came off quickly","I had high hopes for this target, but it proved to fail to excited my crowd consisting of myself, my wife, my two boys and several neighbors."
5,Excellent if it fits your needs...,"Product does what it says. However, you need to follow the instructions! A scope is pretty much mandatory if you want to keep your target pretty. Pistol is something like 30 yards minimum & rifle is 100 yards. Without a scope, you will most likely NOT be able to hit this target at the minimum yardage -- it's small.As I don't care about aesthetics, I have shot with a rifle at about 30 yards. No dents or dings, but paint is completely shattered & flaked off. One of the welded joint is broken from a rifle hit at 20 yards, but does not affect functionality. So far, this spinner has held up to about 100 hits with high velocity ammo. Even at this short distance, I expect the spinner to survive at least 1,000 more hits. Highly recommend if you can follow the directions, or do not care about the paint. If you do follow directions, I expect this target to last a lifetime."
2,very small,"this target is very small. However the quality of the system is ok and the metal used seems very durable dont be fooled by the legs. its only 16"" high."
3,Poorly made,"Nice idea. Better than changing paper targets or setting up cans. However, the powder coating peeled off the larger target with first shot that hit it. Subsequent shots and the powder coating peeled off the smaller ones, as well. It's OK if you want to shoot at gray metal discs. If you're looking to shoot at red or yellow targets, though, better get a different one."
2,very small,"This is okay, except it is very small, much smaller than it would seem in the picture. I was disappointed when I saw the size. It probably says the size somewhere, but the picture sure makes it seem bigger. I bought this at Christmas and am writing the review in May, so I don't have it here to measure, but I think it was about the size of a laptop."
3,You get what you pay for,The target is a bit small but nice. I have Pellet/BB gun and it does the trick. Def. would recommend it for the price and for beginners and advanced shooters.
5,spinner,very pleased with this item it is well built and solid. the stickers do not really stay on an are shot out quickly. but the steel is top notch. of course did not expect the paint to stay on for the life of spinner but with a can of spray paint from the hardware store i expect to get plenty of rounds fired at this target. might order an additional one for ha- ha's
4,"Paint & target stickers don't hold up to bullets, but cast iron does","These spinner targets are fun to shoot, they spin really well and make a great noise when the bullet strikes them. However, the target stickers that are supplied come off after being struck a time or two. The red paint doesn't hold up to a bullet at all. There is bare metal showing where every bullet struck, so by the time we were done, the targets were pretty ugly. The iron holds up okay, although I would advise moving back further than the directions say for .22 rifle shots as there was a bit of shrapnel flying when we were too close.If you want an inexpensive, reusable target for .22 shells, this will work well for you."
2,TC Push Hands by Kauz of little practical help,"Kauz is sincere and seems to have considerable experience, expertise, and charisma. Much of the book is a lament on the human situation and a comment on how Tai chi might improve the world. Only a few pages are actually devoted to the steps of Push Hands, and even these descriptions are not as clear as they should be. He begins to get across the ideas of centering, feeling your partner's energy, feeling the circulation of pressure (force or energy), and what to do as energy diverges from the center - but then he does not develop the ideas in words or diagrams. I have not reviewed other Tai Chi Push Hands material but I think you should look elsewhere carefully first. Good luck."
1,Don't get tempted,What a waste of time and money. I thought I might get some form of insight into Tui shou (a.k.a. Push Hands) but there's nothing of true value here (no offence Herman). I didn't even get standard patterns for the Cheng Man-Ching / Yang style that I believe the author has a background in.
1,Me Too!,Mine also burnt out after only two years. Half of the illumination part flickered untill it finally stopped working all together. Stick with the OEM bulbs!!!!
2,LED 3rd brake light for F250,"I have had mine for 5 years and half of the illumination part is no longer working. Recon would not help me out with a replacement. The LEDs are not worth the extra money. They are supposed to last a loooooong time, and they do not."
5,Perfect replacement light for 98 Ford Ranger,"The factory OEM light was leaking (no longer watertight) and I decided to replace the whole light because the original had been beat up by the elements. I was concerned about whether it fit exactly because I didn't want it to leak. It was a perfect fit for the '98 Ford Ranger and cosmetically looks much nicer than the factory light. The supplied harness plugged right into the factory harness on the truck without any trouble whatsoever.I think the red LED stoplamps are at least as noticeable as the original bulb system - hard to compare directly because they put out a different kind of light. The cargo lights seem brighter than the originals at nighttime, but they are more focused and concentrated on the tailgate. Overall, I am pleased with the product and have no regrets about the purchase."
4,Fun game for adults,"This may be fun to play with kids too I don't know because I have not tried it, but it is lots of fun with adults. It seems like its hard to find alot of really interesting games. Over time they tend to get kind of boring after playing them again and again, but this game is never the same. since everyone has different answers it keeps on being different and interesting each time. I would higly recommend this game."
4,Imaginiff Game,"I purchased this game from Amazon. It was a used game. It looked brand new when I recieved it, except for one corner on the lid that was worn away. This game is enlightening, funny and lots of fun to play. It is more fun the more that play. Up to 8 people can play the game. You could even do partners if you wanted more to play. It is very simple to learn to play it. The rules are simple to understand and follow. Everyone that has played this game with me has loved it.You can learn about each others likes and dislikes and sometime someone's answer would surprise you."
4,"The drummer's on MTV, but the band never will be ...","There is nothing pretty about Puny Human. This is raw, unadulterated rock. The native New Yorkers pound through almost an hour of solid rock-n-roll, with no flash or pomp to be found. They rumble along the way Aerosmith did in the 70s, but with more ""oomph"" behind their rhythm section and more growling than ""Dream On""-like wailing. There's nothing particularly special about this record, but it damn sure rocks."
3,pretty decent...,"I picked this CD up out of the free CD bin at our Radio Station, and thought that I would give it a listen, since I enjoy finding new bands... The CD is pretty good, and the song writing is just fine. But, there does not seem to be a whole lot bringing this band out from the general mold of harder music. They are good, but not especially excelent. If you want to check out a band that has pretty much created this musical style, and continues to inovate, then check out The Melvins. But, all in all, this a pretty good album. Worth the price I paid for it, anyway."
3,The Drummer is on MTV,"The drummer for this band is the ""new Matt Pinfield"" on MTV, he's bald and his name is Iann."
5,Great CD!,I bought this for my Husbands collection of metal cd's. He was very surpirsed when I found this CD is such good shape!Thanks!
4,A classic album by S.T.,"I've been a fan of Suicidal Tendencies for a long time and to be honest one of the best parts of their work was Rocky George,he always added a touch of mysticism to Suicidal's furious punk meets metal style with those well-crafted solos of his.Beyond that this album is pretty well made and Mike Muir dishes out more of his eccentric lyricism in this album and I must admit Suicidal Tendencies wrote some great albums:)"
2,"Great ballot ""Alone"" other than that..not much","The one standout song on this album is the heartfelt ballot ""Alone"" existing as the album's only shining star really as the rest of tracks are boring and a bit dry. I never really liked this album from the S.T.'s. It's just a bit boring. You can really see how the songwriting changed between How Will I Laugh, Controlled by Hatred, and this album. The themes got a little lame is you ask me with songs like ""Give it Revolution"", ""Get Whacked"", and ""Go'n'Breakdown"" just not my style. It seemed like Mike Muir was more concerned with trying to portray a ""G"" image in this than creating great rock.2 stars, for effort and the song Alone but don't buy this album expecting much else"
3,A dying flame.,"It was interesting reading all of the opinions on this album.I'm probably some where in the middle.I love ST ,I've been listining to them about 16 years.Plain and simple, ST's first 3 albums are the best.In order 1.self title + How WILL I LAUGH...(can't decide) 2.Join The Army.That's were rating this album comes in.I've been spoiled listening to those 3 great albums,so obviously this album doesn't cut it!When I hear this album the chemistry is just not there as it once was.Don't get me wrong, I'm not bashing this album completely.I rather listen to this album over 90% of rock that comes out today.Stand out tracks are ALONE(very good),YOU cant bring me down(good),and the rest of the songs are just okay.With the exception of one song,SEND ME YOUR MONEY(WHAT THE F#@! WERE THEY SMOKING),horrible song.If people want to rate this album,compare it to the best first.p.s It's good to hear new ST,CHECK OUT FREEDUMB,NOT THE MOST O.G OR POLISH ALBUM BUT THE BOYS ARE HAVING FUN AGAIN."
1,Lost Again Forever,"Suicidal T., whom started out as the strongest punk/metal fusion band ever go completely limp here in their 5 outing. This is commercial rubish not even worth a listening to. It is a testimony to the sad direction (Infectious Grooves)that Muir was to take ST. If you have ordinary taste you will like this album. If you crave something original and worthwhile check out Join the Army or ANY Sui album BEFORE this one."
1,Implausibility abounds,"I am quite willing to suspend disbelief when reading mysteries/thrillers -- to a point. However, as I read through this book, I found myself saying ""oh come ON"" just too often. The silly ending was bad enough (is there *anything* lazier/lamer than deux ex machina?), but what really bothered me were the attempts at character development. The characters' behavior and reactions were consistently stilted and inauthentic. Worst of all, by the end of the novel I didn't give two hoots about any one of them. I am an avid mystery reader and am especially fond of medical thrillers and series, but I feel no desire to read anything else about Joanna Blalock and her pals. Definitely, a tale of intruigue that was less than intruiguing."
4,"Entertaining, but a disquieting similarity...(spoilers)","I've just ""discovered"" the Joanna Blalok series, and I've been reading them pretty much one after the other. There was a sense of familiarity when I started Deadly Harvest: (spoilers)(spoilers) Joanna and Jake are once again split up, Joanna winds up in the hospital after someone tries to kill her, then she disappears from the hospital when someone tries to kill her again. I'm starting to worry about the poor woman's health; one more severe concussion may finally do her in.<g> However, even with these complaints, the book is entertaining, the plot intense, the characters interesting. Just be prepared to think you might have already read this one. I did. It took several pages to realize the events were only slightly different from the last book in the series I'd read."
5,My favorite book of the series,"I've read the entire Joanna Blalock series and love it. She is an awesome character that you just can't get enough of. This book was my favorite because of the twist that comes in at the end, it took my by surprise and I love that! The ideas in some of the books are a little far fetched, but that's because it's fiction. Anyway, I loved the book and the series. I hope another book is on the way!"
1,Waaay out there,"*spoilers*The bizarre plot is that incredibly rich men screen their prospective wives for genetic compatibility, and then use surrogate mothers to birth children which will be close genetic matches, available to be killed to provide organ transplants for the father, if needed at a future date. The children are raised ""like animals"" under lock and key in a mountain-top compound in Los Angeles County. Meanwhile, the doctor in charge of this compound -- which is owned by organized crime, no less -- maintains his job as a respected surgeon at Joanna Blalock's hospital.The book opens with an attempted sniping by a man with a Ruger Mini-14 shooting .50 caliber bullets. However, the Ruger Mini-14 shoots .223 caliber bullets.There are almost as many murders in this book as there are references to how beautiful Joanna is.This book has few redeeming qualities; it's a definite pass."
2,so many problems with this book,"Ok there are a few things I noticed wrong with this book. First, the quantities seem to be off, probably b/c the author is british, and the UK cups are different than the cups here. Second, the book is poorly organized - one would have to flip through most of it to find a recipe, since there are only four divisions - which I believe are appetizers, salads and light meals, main entrees, and deserts. And third, the recipes are just not practical to make - I like to try new things, but this book takes the exotic really too far. Plus she uses a lot of specialty ingredients that one would have to go hunting for. I found the whole book disappointing."
4,One of my favorites,"I've been cooking veg food for more than ten years and have 100 vegetarian and vegan cookbooks in my collection - this is one of my favorites, especially during summer when I want fresh, delicious, sparkling food. I love to page through this book in search of inspiration before heading to the market. The combinations are mouth-watering and most are relatively easy to fix. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for interesting vegan food."
3,Average,"I was dissapointed with this book. The recipe titles sounded really great, but after making a bunch of recipes I can honestly say that the dishes are just mediocre.One BIG negative for me was the sparing use of vegetables in this book. You would think that this would be impossible in a vegan book, but unfortunately it is the case here. There are even recipes that use no vegetables at all save for a little onion (I am talking about non-dessert items, of course). I, personally, preffer to eat more balanced, healthier meals.On the plus side, I did like the fact that soy-based meat substitutes were not given an emphasis here."
4,Great story. Good book. Lacks detail of how to change.,"This book is a wonderful story about this man, and the potential of every human being. The 21 concepts provided in this book, illustrate a wonderful comprehensive stragey for Self-realization and growth. However, if you already have extensive or even moderate background in Buddhist philosophy and/or deep into Spirituality read this book as a great book. It lacks the detail of how to change and implement the concepts into your daily life for lasting change. If you are still searching for answers, and trying to see who you are in relation to this universe, GRAB THIS BOOK! Just be ready to also, look further for more details on how to implement the concepts Jim Britt speaks of. All in all though, a wonderful book for this time in human evolution. and everyone could benefit from reading Rings of Truth."
5,An empowering book to get you life back and on track.,"I have read and studied much in the area of ""self-help"". Jim Britt takes you on a journey that not only identifies why we are not experiencing the fulness of life, he gives us easy applicable tools to change. For anyone who truly wants to free themselves of the bondage that limits us.I could not put this book down. I, as a rule, never hi-lite or underline a book as I read. My copy of ""The Rings of Truth"" is a sea of yellow.I would and have recommended this book to anyone and everyone. It is a true complement to ""The Ninth Wonder""."
5,FANTASTIC Flavor,"Would love to know if this product is every coming back. I used the Go Lean vanilla protein powder every morning for the past six years and now its gone. What I loved most about it was, that unlike other protein powders, it left no unusual protein aftertaste. I miss it and am saddened I can no longer purchase it."
3,"Great rarities, unnecessary filler","My header sums it up, but if you don't already have the filler tracks (from other albums) then you'll enjoy it all."
3,try the best-ofs,"there are some great, neglected album tracks on this collection (especially English Boys and Angels On The Balcony), but the live tracks are duff, and the demos are pretty much as you'd expect. The Robert Fripp credit is really a misnomer - he only plays guitar on the live version of Heroes. Try the Platinum Collection."
1,Not a worthy Blondie compilation,"Blonde & Beyond was ment to recapulate to what Blondie stood for: punk and new wave. But it isn't !! Too many great Blondie songs are lacking and you hardly get anything in return.The only reason why I bought this album was for the spanish version of Call me and Underground girl. The rest of the album tracks is easy to get nowadays on their originally remastered albums. And if your not such a big Blondie fan to buy all their albums. You can buy their latest Greatest Hits remastered and contain 19 of their biggest hits. And if you want more Blondie try the excellent Platinum Blonde double collection, it gives you a lot more pleasure for your money!"
3,Only had a couple of months..,Warning these get very hot.. I got a bad burn - my fault for leaning on it.. The lights look nice but the wires go everywhere and the transformer is bulky.. The bad deal is you have to have the transformer to run them.. For 20 bucks their a good deal and so far I like them.
2,And Now for Something Different,"I often find myself with recordings by unfamiliar artists and expecting something quite different than what I get. Sometimes it's a disappointment and sometimes it's a pleasant surprise. This was neither. I was expecting a different style and did not care overmuch for the style I heard but I did recognize skill in vocals, instrumentation and arranging. This band is good at what they do; I just don't care overmuch for what it is that they do.The lead singer does have a beautiful voice. Every so often, just as I was beginning to enjoy her voice, another one would superimpose itself. I can't describe the second voice as much more than a berserk roar. It reminded me of old drill sergeants excepts that it was less intelligible. From the context, it seemed to be planed that way but I did not care for it."
2,so so,"Honestly, i think this album's not half as good as MOT. as a matter of fact, it's worse than their 1990 release, 'step in the arena'. it's just an okay album."
4,This album is a fine example of Gangstarr's unlimited skill.,"Daily Operation is Gangstarr's third full length album. Some sources have labeled it as a jazz release but it however is not. Gangstarr fuses a jazz type sound into there music on occasion. The album is a short step above there previous release ""Step in the Arena."" Some of the better songs include ""Soliloquoy of Chaos"", ""Ex Girl to Next Girl"", ""No Shame in My Game"", and others. The song ""Soliloquoy of Chaos"" contains one of the greatest hip-hop beats ever made. It is a beautiful orchestra beat dug up by DJ Premier,(who also produces all of Gangstarr's songs.) Many of the songs on this album are lower key than you would be used to with a Gangstarr release. The Guru brings his signature monotone rapping style to each song which blends well with Premiers incredible beats. Overall, this is a strong rap album which stays true to the underground."
4,Great Music,"A lot of these young people who never experienced rap before Kris Kross may not appreciate the artists who influenced the industry in the early days. I haven't forgotten the days when I used to jam to ""Ex to the Next."" I love the fusion of jazz and rap. Premier has to be one of the greatest 3 djs in rap history. Genius doesn't come that often in the music industry. The greatest shame is when those who ARE are not well appreciated. I would suggest to anyone who likes rap to make sure this album is part of your collection!!"
3,The Gathering,"I remember this movie from when it first aired on TV and remembered loving it. However, when I watched it again, I noticed the acting wasn't as good as I remembered and there were not smooth transitions where the commercials were. But I still love the story and will continue to watch it every Thanksgiving/Christmas holiday time."
2,The Gathering Pts I & II,"I'm not able to view these titles on my large screen TV because I only have a DVD player/recorder hooked up to it. If I want to watch it on one of my smaller screens, they work just fine. I don't get this technology! I own over 1900 movies to watch on my 60"" screen, but not this family favorite. Needless to say, I'm not the happiest camper with this item!!!"
2,Christmas tradition,"Even though the first production of this classic is a bit dated, it's still a good Christmas tradition. The follow-up is a waste of time ... poorly acted, no story ... just tries to live off the 1st version."
5,Holiday Season family movie,"We love this movie, and look forward to watching it Christmas Eve, and adding it to our Christmas movie library."
5,The Gathering,I have this on tape and have looked for it on DVD a long time. This is one of my favorite Christmas movies! I watch it every year. DVD quality is excellent.
5,Family Tradition,Have been waiting to see on DVD. Was watching an old copy. We watch on our girls weekend every November.
1,UNSATISFIED,"AFTER READING REVIEWS, I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD MOVIE FOR THE HOLIDAY. I DID NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE. THIS MOVIE SUCKED."
5,The Best for Christmas,"I saw this absolutely beautiful film when it was first shown. I was beginning college and to this day I watch it not only at Christmas but whenever I need a pick me up. This movie teaches all about forgiveness and demonstrates that from sadness and sorrow one can find the silver lining and hope eternal.First rate performances with a story that's right on target. I managed to purchased a tape when it was on the shelf over twenty years ago and it hasn't worn out, yet. I am thinking I should get a few copies for backup and loved ones.It needs to be on DVD. Will the powers that be please hear us!"
5,The Gathering,"I was so excited to finally find this movie here at Amazon! It is a family favorite and we taped it off of TV many years ago but the tape wore out from viewing it so much and I have been looking for it for years and learned about Amazon, I truly thought I would never find it. I plan to buy several for myself and my kids as they will enoy sharing it with there families soon. I wish it would come out on DVD, but until then I will continue to watch it always between Thanksgiving and Christmas."
2,The Gathering,"I purchased this DVD as a gift for someone who had seen the original TV release.The quality of the DVD is VERY POOR, most of it was too dark to veiw and the color was distored on the parts that were visible. Unfortunately I purchased my gift early and had it for more than 30 days before it was viewed so I'm stuck with something I can't watch or return.The Gathering (2 Disc Special Edition includes The Gathering, Part II)"
4,"Ah, family",What can I say? If you are old enough to remember when this was a holiday season staple on television or can't remember a world without blue ray : this is a touching story. ( Perhaps a bit dated ) A good watch with every generation of the family.
5,Finally!,I waited for years for these to come out on DVD. I wanted these movies so bad I would have even bought them for VCR. Both of these movies are very good and well worth watching.
4,The Gathering,"This was one of favorite TV movies. Years ago I lived near Chagrin Falls, Ohio, and I loved the feel of the small town. The movie includes Ed Asner (one of my favorite character actors) and Maureen Stapleton. I had been looking for years, and I am very pleased with the purchase."
4,The Gathering,The Gathering was as good as I remembered and a good selection for anyone wanting a holiday story worth watching.
5,Great Great Movie,"I enjoyed the movie very much.. It made me think of my childhood Christmases as it was always important for my father to have all his children home for the Holidays, especially Christmas-not just when he was sick with his cancer. My brothers and sisters were living in different areas also and difficult for some of us to get home at times. However, we did not know when his last Christmas would be until it was too late. D. Beauman"
1,Very upset they sent a horror movie instead!,"So I order this wonderful, happy, family movie called The Gathering, with Ed Azner, for my mom. They send me this scary horror movie called The Gathering. Uh, hello warehouse worker read the invoice and get it right! Right name ~ wrong stock number. NOT VERY HAPPY! D:"
4,A fine Christmas drama,"This is a well written and finely acted family drama that is suitable for all ages (it was made for TV after all), although young children would probably be bored by it since it doesn't concern Santa Claus or zany, slapstick antics. The story of a man facing death in the very near future from an incurable disease who wants to reconcile with his estranged family wasn't original even when this film was produced, but intelligent writing, sensitive direction and a cast of accomplished character actors manage to deliver the story without any of the usual sappiness one gets from most made-for-TV Christmas soap operas. This film is definitely worth adding to your Christmas film collection."
5,The Gathering & Part II,"I had been looking for a while hoping these movies would come out on DVD and was pleased to find them on Amazon. They could not be found in stores in my area. I thought the price was reasonable for two movies, and I received them in good condition even though The Gathering Part II DVD was loose in the package. They played well and am glad to have them added to my Christmas collection. These movies touch the heart."
1,christmas vhs,This movie had alot of messed up places in it. Could not enjoy the movie. Quality was what I thought it would be.
5,Haven't seen this yet.,We haven't watched this movie yet but expect to enjoy it. I didn't know how to post a comment without giving a grade...
4,The Gathering DVD,Video quality is for the most part good...Chapter 4 of the Gathering disc has interference but before and after this chapter is good.
5,The Gathering(The Best Christmas Movie Of My Generation!),The Gathering in my opinion is the greatest Christmas movie of my generation. It is heart-warming it is a movie that the whole family can enjoy. Actually five stars isn't enough. You have to get this movie for your family. I highly recommend it. You won't be disappointed I guarantee it.
5,christmas gifts,This is a great movie. We watch it every year with all the others. This will bring back the 1970's. If your in your 40's and 50's you will like this movie.
1,Big diappointment!,The DVD I purchased does not play. It stops afer the piracy warning and does not continue!! What is the problem??
5,The Gathering,"I love love love this movie,I also have it on VHS I made my self years ago.I still enjoy it,but watching it on these new flat screens and this format is not enjoyable any longer! I do hope they decide to bring it out in DVD format soon!"
5,Wonderful family movie!,"It has been years since I've seen this movie, but it really made an indelible impression on me. However, I haven't been able to get it on Amazon, but thanks to another reviewer for mentioning that he got it at Warner Bros. -- which I did but for a sale price of $14.95. Thank you!"
5,Love it!,We couldn't wait for this to come in DVD form. I had recorded it years ago on VCR tape and we had watched it so much the tape was worn out. Love the actors and actress' in this film. Highly recommend this DVD!
5,we watch this every year!,"this is the one movie that we watch every year at Christmas time. It's fresh, and beautiful and moving each and every time we watch it. I highly recommend it. Gather the family around, or watch it with someone. It's a keeper."
5,Quiet Holiday classic that's still relevant,"Perfect dose of hokey and touching with the best holiday movie musical score; made for TV or otherwise. Nothing beats the moment when Asner realizes ""It's happening. It's really happening."""
3,Quick Delivery,"Was surprised to receive only one egg cup for well over 10$ including shipping. Somehow I understood that there were 4 egg cups. Guess I must look closer next time!? Fast Delivery, exactly as described except for the above mentioned ""misunderstanding"" on my part."
4,Confessions of a Second Story Man,"I grew up in Kensington and know several of the people referenced in the book. Therefore; the book probably had more impact on me than it would on others, but it is an interesting book much in the same vain as the movie Good Fellows. If you like stories about wise guys and crooks it is a great read"
4,good reading,"A good book especially if you are from the Delaware Valley. Lots of familiar names and neighborhoods mentioned in the book. One issue I have with the writer is the amount of repetiton when he writes about the gangs and their ""ethics.""Also I wish the page numbers were available for Kindle."
1,Not Exactly That Accurate,"I would go so far as to say this book was very inaccurate. Leo Gillis was not thrown in the back of a meat truck like a piece of trash and run around town by those two morons. We were all at his funeral. Danny Gundaker didn't die of lung cancer either. I know, he was my brother. Very few of them were two-fisted, beer-guzzling, ear- and nose-biting hoodlums. They were classy, nice guys who stole for a living. I grew up around these guys. I went into a Casino with Danny and we would get the looks. There was just something about them, what can I say. Overall, it was a fun read, you will enjoy it."
4,Good read...brought back a lot of memories for my father.,"Even though his name wasn't printed (thankfully), the book brought back many good memories and stories for my dad (an former K&A; guy himself.) His days of running with Dolan, ""Raybo"", and the Stockers are long behind him and distant memories, but if he says the book is pretty accurate, then I believe him. He should know since he had ""ringside"" seats for most of it.Great stuff!"
1,Poor product that lasted 2 weeks.,"Bought this mug on ability to clean lid properly and its interesting design. Worked well for a about 10 days and the red lever broke during washing. The red lever is made of brittle plastic that will break easily and leave you with a lid that can't be used.I recommend the Thermos E5 instead which is similarly priced, comes in various sizes and is much better design and durability."
3,Purchased to Compare...,"I purchased this mug and a Thermos spill prof travel mug to compare the merits / complications of both. Bost perform admirably in maintaining the temperature and retainign their spill-proof-ness, however the 'red lever' in the title of this Timolino mug is loose where it attaches to the lid, and is prone to fall out/off... So -- if you travel with it in a bag, on mass transit, etc. you need to be wary of losing this critical piece of the mug. If lost, you then have to unscrew the lid to access your beverage which completely defeats the purpose..."
2,Big Disappointment,"I was very disappointed with this book. There are only a handful of interesting pictures - no really new ideas - just lots of wasted shots on the photographer's part. Yes, the house is nice. But, unless you have this much space, rooms this large and this type of architecture, you'll not be able to use 75% of even these tired decorating suggestions."
5,"A fine line between genius and crazy, but who cares","Six years ago I walked into Kelly's Pub in San Diego (a favorite hang out at that time). On a stage about the size of my bed were two guys playing their guitars and soliciting the crowd for beer. After watching these two guys for a few minutes I noticed that their lyrics were very clever, a mix of humor and street smarts. They called themselves the Rugburns. I kept coming back to watch them as the crowds kept getting larger and larger until they outgrew the place. I was really happy when they put out an album. I already knew the songs by heart. Their music is great but their style is eclectic so only get this album if you enjoy intelligent music, you have a sense of humor and you aren't in an iron lung. One small aside, their second album ""Taking the World by Donkey"" is even better."
4,Jewel's ex & his own brand of humor,"Masterful, smooth and talented (probably not); the ""Rugburn's"" Morning Wood is a raw cutting-edge album comprised of humorous lyrics, offbeat sounds and obscure literary references. Two out of every three Houses of the Holy fans agree that this album is a must-have! Buy it and listen to ""Me and Eddie Vedder."""
4,"FUN,DIFFERENT AND MORE FUN !!","I FELL INTO THE BURNS ON COMPLETE ACCIDENT . I BELIEVE THAT STEVE POLTZ IS A FINE LIRICYST WITH AGREAT SENSE OF HUMOR. HIS SOLO VENTURE SHOW HIS ABILITY TO GO A LITTLE MORE TO THE SERIOUS SIDE TOO. MOMMY IM SORRY WAS THE FIRST BURNS I HAD HEARD,AND IS STILL PROBABLY MY FAVORITE OF THEIRS. IF YOU GET A CHANCE TO SEE STEVE POLTZ OR THE RUGBURNS LIVE, DO IT!!"
5,good stuff,product did what i expected it to do. if i'm expected to review a product then i don't expect to be told how many words i need to use.
3,Not Perfect But It Works,"I bought this to used In a Rife, Doug coil machine set up, It seem every since It learned about The Bob Beck Protocol and Rife, Doug coil machine, My trash problem has Increased so If there Is Anyone that knows how to get rid of magic trash let Me know. As said before It has a boot up problem sometimes You have to unplug It flip the switch then plug It back In then turn It on. Also It has a dial that takes a long time turning It to get It to the Frequency that You want for Me that Is around 612 Hz then It will vary around 8 Hz off of the set Frequency. If You only working with Audio Frequencies then there are Computer programs that are down loadable which You can try out for free but some of them the Frequencies are Not what Is shown and on top of that they give You a password that does Not work that Is why I bought this because of passwords that do Not work."
1,It wasn't suicide,"Kurt did not commit suicide. Spread the word, because people need to know the truth. Go to justiceforkurt.com and I promise you will change your mind for good.~Alma, 15Rest in peace dear Kurt, I'll always love you."
5,This book kicks ass!,"n accurate an informative description of the life and death of rock poet Kurt Cobain. What I specially like about the bok is Suzi's description that makes Kurt look like a human and not as the God the media made him.Luis Artigas, 13Caracas, Venezuela"
2,I believe i am kurts biggest fan,Ive read it as well as countless amounts of other material yes it is a good book but kurt didn't kill himself and it has other incorrect information as well. If your going to write a book get the facts strait
3,Great fun for the money.,"Be kind to this fairly well designed dueling tree and it will hold up. We've tested it with .22's, .380, 9mm, and .45 cal. All were okay until one of us hit it with a .762 rifle - the tree is not tough enough for this and things began to break. This is a fun product and, for $75, I will gladly buy another one."
2,Poor quality,"First day of use at a little over 100 yards with soft nose 115 grain bullets out of a 7.62x39 (a lot milder than the advertised 9mm to 30-06) a round hit the tatget a little on the inside and it cracked like an egg at the hinge, destroying the bushing that holds the target to the tree.. I wrote Amazon and I am expecting to hear from them as far as warranty or other remedy, hope they do honor to their name."
3,Fun but short lived,Not a bad price and quick delivery. Was easy to calibrate and set up. First 200 rounds were awesome.Tension set screws began to come out and target brackets began to crack.Targets still intact but tensioners are useless with the cracked frames and the stripped set screw threading.
1,Not worth it.,"Not worth it at all. Took it out once, shot it with the approved lead semiwad cutter .45s and .357s and it sheared almost every pattle on the back. The little bolts came out and have sheared as well. Better suited to shoot a .22 at and just watch the paddle wiggle."
1,looks good; breaks easy,"we received the box on a wednesday; assembly took about 15 min. and was fairly easy to do. the next saturday we took the target out to the desert to shoot. we shot only pistol rounds at the target beginning with .22s and going up to .40 S&W. the target functioned as designed about 90% of the time; sometimes when a bullet struck the paddle the paddle would not rotate to to the other side and would stay in the middle, requiring stoppage of firing and hand re-setting. after we shot 500 rounds of 9mm and .40 s&w rounds we changed the tension of the paddles so we could use .22s and noted three of the six paddles had cracked mounting hinges. the cracks are wide enough to stick a fingernail in and run the length of the hinge; since the paddles and hinges are 1-piece all three paddles need to be replaced. i don't want to see what the hinges look like after another 1000 rounds of usage so this bad boy is getting returned and we're buying a better quality target. happy shooting!"
4,Rare emotion and strength,"The album ""under a big sky"" is just one of those rare, great ablums that you can sing along to in the car. This ranks up there with the Eagles, as a great road trip cd. A must buy for anyone into acoustic rock."
1,How did this book make it to hard cover?,"Although I thoroughly enjoyed the first book in this series (Permed to Death), this one was very disappointing. It was not well written, the villain was too easy to spot, and some of the things that come out of Marla's mouth are totally ridiculous. She acts like everone's psychotherapist, and people just accept it. She throws in yiddish words in ridiculous places, just for effect, and her obsession with pleasing her family after the Tammy episode in the past is sickening. I'm through with this series."
3,"Fun, but too obvious.","I did enjoy this mystery, reading about the different restaurants, the descriptions of the mangrove swamp, etc., but the clues might as well have been underlined in red in the book. How many times did we have to read about Marla almost opening the letter from the dead lawyer to know it was pivotal to the plot? How many times did we have to read about the potential boyfriend's brief moments of bad behavior to know he was involved? I don't think I've ever correctly solved a mystery before the end of a book, but it was patently obvious here by halfway through. And Marla's desperation to have her cousin respect her was a little too pathetic. I look for improvement in subsequent attempts, as the story was for the most part enjoyable."
3,Good feel but bad design,This holster holds the phone very tightly and comes in and out very easily. My only complaint is that when wearing on the side of my hip the holster sticks out and I broke 2 by walking closely and catching on filing cabinets etc.
3,"Right cover, wrong contents","The cover of the book is William of Malmesbury's Chronicle..., however, the coverpage and contents is The Anglo-Saxon Home by John Thrupp: Right cover, wrong contents. The correct contents would be nice."
1,Wrong Text,"I had the same issue as JP. The cover is Malmesbury, but the text is the Anglo Saxon Home. I'd find a different edition."
5,Opium Perfume,Very happy with purchase. Will continue to purchase from this seller as long as product is available. Price is good. Shipping time is as promised. Excellent seller!
2,Not the original Opium Perfume,Opium Perfume has been reformulated and this is not the original fragrance. I have been using Opium perfume since it was first introduced in 1977 and LOVED it - this is not the same! I am very disappointed that Yves Saint Laurent and the fragrance sellers are being deceptive about this. They should state that the fragrance has been changed or change the name so that consumers are not tricked.
1,not good,"This product is not old Opium,even thoigh your picture shows the old formula.The new Opium doesn't smell the same and doesn't last like the old formula,it's crud.The companyselling it did a fine job and gave me my money back."
3,Nice,This was a gift and they received before estimated dates.Fast!!! Was suprised being an Eau de Parfume being resonable price
3,Different,The formula has changed.....................for the worst. I used to love this but gave it my wife and just doesn't smell the same.
5,Max Lucado stories,These are fantastic stories for kids /teens of any age. The only problem is it took FOREVER TO GET HERE.
3,Great DVd,This DVD was part of a series of presents based on one of Max Lucado's book but it took nearly 1 month to arrive and I was not able to have it in time for Christmas.
5,Deliteful,The description of Kurosawa meets Python was very apt.I thought the story was excelent. The acting was a bit hammed but it fit with the story line perfectly. It was both entertaining and moving at the same time. And the castle was handsome.It was wonderful choice for a lazy summer evening video.
3,Black Ace is wild,"Bob Steele and 'Big Boy' Williams are best known for the many westerns they appeared in over their long careers. Both men also worked extensively on TV (especially Steele, who portrayed Trooper Duffy on F TROOP! for two seasons).Four of the twelve episodes in THE MYSTERY SQUADRON are recap chapters of film clips. This was a common studio cost-cutting practice.THE STORY: A dam-project engineer hires two stunt pilots to protect an unfinished dam from THE MYSTERY SQUADRON, led by the elusive ""Black Ace."" Attacks from this squadron are always preceded by the arrival of a model-sized plane. The two pilots eventually get accused of being gang members, and must fight off their nemeses while simultaneously trying to clear their names.CAST:Bob Steele - Fred CromwellGuinn 'Big Boy' Williams - Bill 'Jellybean' CookLucile Browne - Dorothy GrayJ. Carrol Naish - CollinsPurnell Pratt - Lafe Johnson.For more marvelous aeronautical serial action, check outSKY RAIDERS."
5,Good transaction,"The product was delivered on time and in perfect condition. My only complaint is that the company, Alpha Video, stamps their logo randomly throughout the episodes to prevent or discourage pirating activities. Other than that, the DVD was a good purchase delivered on time."
2,Mystery Squadron,"While I like the old serials, this one was just too dated and a bit fragmented on the story line."
1,forgetable,"It was not at all memorable. There is a very good reason I never heard of this serial or the cast. Neither the series or cast won any awards. ""Surprise, surprise, surprise.""none of these Saturday afternoon serials were particulary good. Captain Marvel was ok. Batman stunk too. Superman was good."
3,Not what I expected from the photos,I'm not wholly displeased with this product--BUT:There is no thickness whatsoever to the tentacles; they're not much more than double-sided ribbons. There is also a very insubstantial feel to the toy--not what I expect from Beanie products at all.
4,Squid Beanie Baby,"It's a beanie baby that is a squid. Exactly what I expected. If you have children that are into squid, this is a great soft toy for them."
3,Not worth the money,"This squid is cute, but their is no stuffing in it's tentacles. My daughter played with it for one day and hasn't touched it since."
2,Top Heavy,"The thermometer is too tall for my 6 qt Le Creuset so it is top heavy. It fell off and out of the pot and the plastic casing melted on one side before I could rescue it. If you are working with a very deep pot, I imagine it would work fine."
5,A Wonderful Book!,"While reading Rescuing Jeffery, I was struck at the refreshing honesty that Mr. Galli presented to the reader. His remarkable and candid account of the decisions and thoughts he as a loving father had to go through during a horrible time are truly touching and poignant. This is an inspiring book that touches upon many of the most important and beautiful aspects of the human spirit."
3,Easy read on leadership,"I was assigned this book as part of a leadership class and really enjoyed it. It provided a perspective on leadership that I had not found in other books: the importance of authenticity in leadership. Crosby does a good job of discussing how authority and consensus work together when leadership is expressed clearly, truly, and authentically. I wouldn't say that it is a ""must read"" but I do think that those interested in leadership would gain from his unique perspective."
1,Impractical information,"This study guide is well-written, and it does contain four practice-length tests. The review material, however, is not very useful. Instead, it is representative of philosophical sounding ""ed-talk,"" and it will not help you answer the practice questions provided by the ETS website. In the technology section, the authors advise you not to type overheads on typewriters, and they refer to e-mail as ""electronic mail."" Though published in 2009, this material has clearly not been updated in a long time."
2,Just a glance,"Yes, it has four set of questions, but even those are easy to break. They are no similar that the questions in the real exam. Plus the explanatory part from the competencies are vague constantly you have to check emanating online or from other sources"
4,Fresh and Fun,"I absolutely love ""Fragile"". Jen Marks unique song writing style shines in this latest album. A must have for your CD collection, you'll want to hit the 'repeat' button and play it all day. Then when you're walking down the street or riding in the subway, her lyrics will pleasantly run through your head."
5,I Love This CD,I am so psyched that I found this CD. She is an incredible new artist that you will hear about soon. Don't pass this one up.
5,Excelente trabajo de música de cámara,Esta grabación de la musica de cámara es sensacional. Excelente solistas todos y maravillosa música académica del gran compositor brasilero Heitor Villalobos. Este cd es una joya musical en cuanto a sonido e interpretación. Maravilloso trabajo del flautista William Bennett.
5,Great PSU,"I had this PSU for a year and I've been having a great experience with it. First, OCZ gives a 3 year warranty and then there's the quality build, the great looks and the modular cabling, which helps improve airflow in the case. It's also dead silent, and the blue led adds a nice touch to those that have windowed cases."
2,"It was informational, but could be better!","It would have been easier to read if it had been in bigger print. There was probably a lot more useful information in there that could have helped me, had I been able to read it."
5,wonderful,this is a very positive approach and help in the lose it for life system...these devotions are very good
5,Lose It For Life is life changing!,"This book has changed my life! I've tried so any diets and failed each time. This time is different because I'm surrendering to God and admitting I can't do this alone. Reading this book you'll learn the reasons why you may overeat, binge or graze. You learn to distinguish true hunger instead of emotional hunger. I would recommend this book to anyone who is or has ever struggled with their weight."
1,Hard to run on any OS (windows 7 or XP),"I have 3 gaming pc's, (2 with windows 7)--( 1 with XP).I have not been able to run this on any system to even rate it.Save you money and get something that works this is not it.It will not run on any thing and my 2 windows 7 gaming rigs are new one with 2 evga gtx560 ti's 2gb each in sli, and one with a evga gtx580 3gb video card in it.I have a amd phenome II X4 975 CPU in one and a amd phenome II X6 1100T in the other.I have 16 gig of hyperx DDR3 1600 ram in each pc.I have one pc with XP in it still just to run the old games that will not run right on windows 7 and it will not run on this pc at all.I have a amd phenome II X4 955 and 8 gigs of hyperx ddr3 ram in this pc.I run a evga gtx 560 2gb(non ti in this one).If it would work I could run it.I have run alot of games over the years and I have found some that have issues but will run some on windows 7 or xp but this game will not run and I have more than one copy that I ordered from amazom."
1,would be a good game if it worked,i install the game and tried to play but it did nothing at all. the hour glass stayed on and nothing ran. it would be a good game if i could get it to play.
3,Everything that glitters isn't gold,The phone has a nice design. The digital answering machine also has a few good feature. My overall disappointment came from the sqeaking/humming sound that I experienced less than 2 feet form the base. I tried changing the channel numerous times but that didn't work. However I walled about 50 feet down the hall outside my apartment and remarkably the sound was clear. The times when the phone wasn`t full of static the sound quality was very good for a analog 900 mhz cordless phone
5,The Neighborhood to Watch,"Diane McKinney-Whetstone, Leaving Cecil Street, is a vibrant and intriguing novel. The characters make the street and the story come alive. If you like The Women of Brewster's Place, you'll love this one. This story will give book clubs something interesting to talk about."
3,"Fun, but you get what you pay for","The pool was nice and deep, no complaints there. But the sun shade I found to be too close to the pool. Hard to get the kids in and out of the pool. Would have been better if taller. Only other complaint is the durability, but with any plastic pool, rips and tears are going to happen. Only lasted one summer..........."
3,Not the best covers but all Beatles fan must have it,"As a collector of Beatles songs recorded by other artists, it was for me the only way to get The Lennon/McCartney ""Don't Bother Me"". I don't have heard about another version except the Beatles of course and this one by Gregory Philips.If anyone knows the ""Dr Robert"" song sung by others than the Beatles, please contact me."
3,good luck finding this!,"good luck finding this gem! nice alt-prog rock wi standard guitar/drum sound. 'I will Persuade You' got some airtime on the underground channels (I heard it on WHFS Annapolis, late 80s), but the best song is the last, 'I Swallowd My Pride', which should be on every one of those 'Light Rock/Oldies' stations playlists. Recommended."
1,fuji video tapes extremely poor quality?,"No matter what they call this trash ""Master"", ""pro"", or ""HQ"" these tapes are really made poorly. I've Got 20 or so and every single one of them has lines running through them or have completely snapped in two. It seems very strange to me why this is so since Fuji makes superior film for cameras that has never given me an problems at all. If you Want to buy quality tapes stick with ""Maxell or Sony"" I've got over 2,000 of these and have had only 6 or 7 duds."
1,Why Bother?,"Needless to say this book was a colossal dissapointment. This book was based utterly on the choice to have sex or not, and don't get me wrong I adore Meg Cabot's books, but I ask you...a WHOLE book based on SEX? It seems more like a steamy romance novel, not the witty humor we've all come to know and love. Besides the fact the plot was incredibly repetitious, the characters acted out of the personality that was established in All-American Girl. Luckily I didn't buy the book, just borrowed it from a friend, so I didn't have to waste sixteen dollars on that lamentable piece of work.JUST A NOTE: If you really like Meg Cabot and are thinking about getting Reday or Not, don't waste your money just check it out from the local library."
1,Completely disgusting book!,I'm glad i skimmed this before buying for my niece. This book is very vulgar-glorifying sex between unmarried minors. There is nothing else that needs to be said
3,Ready or Not,"This story of a confused girl, preoccupied and even obsessed with an issue that she is not ready to handle, is dotted with a few humorous situations that are the novel's only redeeming qualities."
2,"""Ready or Not""? How about ""Don't Even Start This Book""?","I hate to echo some of the reviews already here, but plain and simple: This book sucks.It's a total and complete waste of time, and it skewers your view of Samantha from the first, delightful book (All-American Girl). THE ENTIRE BOOK is spent with Samantha freaking out over whether she and her boyfriend are going to have sex or not. First of all, why doesn't she just ASK HIM??!?! Second of all, is it really all that appropriate for Meg Cabot to keep making insecure, teenage girl characters who seem to be completely and obsessively consumed with boyfriends, pop culture, and sex, even though she paradoxically makes them say things that would make them seem to be pretty politically/gender-relations conscious?I think it's totally ridiculous.Meg Cabot is slipping into cheap, money-making plots, and if it continues, her once-fabulous books will become pathetic."
1,Ready or Not? I Definitely Wasn't Ready for This...,"I've been reading Meg Cabot since I was in junior high, and even now in college, I like to pick her up when I need a simple, very quick read. This book sorely dissapointed me. I felt like I was reading a Planned Parenthood sponsored book, not the easy-going and lighthearted tween novels of my past. Besides being extremely one-sided, the book lacked a real plot line--the sex thing enough is just not enough to pull the reader in."
2,I miss the old character,"I loved the first book, All American Girl, because I really felt like the character was me (with the obvious exception that I haven't jumped in front of a bullet). But this one? While Sam still is pretty awesome, it makes me sad that all she thinks about is sex when she is so brilliant.Don't get me wrong, I'm not offended by the subject matter. It's the character's shallowness that disturbs me and one track mind.This is exactly the reason why I stopped reading the Princess Diaries series."
5,A dose of reality with a helping of humor.,"Yes, this is a book for young people which discusses sex. We should praise Meg Cabot for keeping it real. A junior in high school who has a serious boyfriend MUST think about wether he or she is going to have sex or not, regardless of their circumstances. A book like this which handles the issue with some humor and ablomb will help its young readers come to terms with the issue in their own lives. If a parent is upset about the books content maybe they should have paged through it or read the books jacket! Who knows, a book like this might even give them something to talk about!"
2,Let down,In the end it was quite a let down after the building up should just stick to first book only
2,Not the Best,"In my opinion, Ready or Not was an unecessary sequal. The story line was very forsed, and there was no real plot to the story. It was strained in many aspects, and extremely confusing. It does not live up to the first at all. Not very good."
2,Not worth the money.,"I purchased this book both because I really enjoyed the first novel 'All American Girl', and I am a big fan of Meg Cabot. However after reading it I can't help but feel let down and disappointed. The books main focus was on Sam wondering weather she should have sex with her boyfriend or not. Needless to say it became very old, very quickly. I think the entire book was a bit of a cliché. I do disagree a bit with some of the other reviewers; in that I think there is nothing wrong in handling the topic of sex (even with teens), but in this book it wasn't handled as well I thought it would be (Meg Cabot being the author). So for those of you considering buying this book, I would defiantly recommend thinking twice. If you really want to read it, borrowing it from the library would be a much better option."
3,A disappointment,"Although I haven't read the first book, I was quite disappointed with this one. Meg Cabot usually delivers very fun summer-ish reads. This book, however, I found kind of...stupid. Basically, Samantha' dilemma is that she isn't ready to have sex but thinks her boyfriend is. The whole book is pretty much her stressing: Should I have sex? Shouldn't I have sex? Does David want to have sex? Do I want to have sex?... The whole book just revolves around her and sex. I wish there was more of a plot!"
1,A waste of money and a waste of time,"As a 12 year old girl I was extremely excited to know that a sequel to All American Girl came out. I was dissapointed to find out that the whole book whether or not Samantha Madison is ready for sex. The book jacket does NOT make it sound like that was what the book was about. Some things said were on the jacket was ""hilarious"", ""spunky"", ""witty"", and ""great fun."" I don't think that's the case. As the book progreses, you think that Sam will make the right decision and say ""no"" to sex. But in the end, she agrees to sex. The author also made it seem like having sex, as a sixteen year old, is okay because Sam used birth control. As a preteen and a lover of previous Meg Cabot books I was extremely disapointed with the out-come of this book. I think it gave the wrong impression to teens. I found it disgusting, dissapointing, a let down, and a HUGE waste of time. This book leaves readers thinking that having sex out of wedlock is okay, as long as you use birth contol."
2,Disappointed,"I have been a Meg Cabot fan for several years and I have read a lot of her books, that said I am very disappointed in the topics of ""Ready or Not"" and the newest Princess Diaries book. Both books focus on sex and the pressures of our culture to have premarital sex. They discuss the pressure put on by boyfriends and peers alike.The purpose of my review is to make potential readers aware that the content in this book could be offensive to them. Personally, I firmly believe that sex is a gift from God that should be saved until marriage. I was a little put out that Meg Cabot did not take that view in her writing. I wish I would have know more about the topic of the book before reading it.Despite all of this, the book is well written with lots of humor. It is very well done and is not graphic or descriptive."
1,Not worth your Money Or time,"I picked this book up at the store over the summer when i had just read all american girl. I really like the first story, so i was delighted to finally read a sequel.But now that i think back, its not worth getting to excited over, andi i have to says, this is the worst Meg Cabot book i ever started reading. I didnt bother finishing it!Thankfully i went to the store and got my money back.Don't get me wrong here, Meg Cabot is one of my favorite authors, but this book is targeted at a much more mature audience. It says ages 12 and up in the book. However i would definetly not recommend this to any 12 year old. I would say 15 and up is a better place to target it at.Overall, if there werent so many references (i only got to page 143), it wouldve been more appropraite, and more enjoyable"
5,Certain parents,"I personally loved this book because yes I'm a young teen, a teen but still not old enough for my mom to here say the word sex. I liked the book because it was a new side to the teen sex scene. With parents trying to hide books like this kids pre teens and teens. Okay if they know what sex is then its okay. And its not like they aren't living in a world that revolves about sex and you can't keep that from teens. Us teens DO think about, DO talk about, and DO like to read about it. Theres a shout to parents from a girl older then 13 (just in case you were wondering from before)"
3,Communtion people!!!!!!,"This book was alright. It was NOT as good as ""All American Girl"". The problem I have with this book is that this whole think could have been avoiled if Sam and David would have just talked. If you can not talk about it...then you shouldn't do it. The ""bathtub"" sceen seen really out of place. Easy Meg this is a teen novel, not one of your adult novles. I am not one of those people who think sex is wrong until marriage, but I don't that they ANYWHERE near ready to do it. I also can't believe that ""the pill"" wasn't even talked about. If you are going to start doing it..the pill is a must."
3,Ready or not- for a complete change in Sam,"Personally, the letdown for me was not that Meg Cabot decided to write a book completely devoted to a girl wanting to lose her virginity. No, what angered me was that she chose a character that was already established and well-loved to write this plotline around.What I mean is, is that most people expect a sequel to follow the same style of the book that it follows. I really felt that the first book and the second book were completely different. Sure, the protagonist had the same name and went to the same school, etc, etc, but her character depth and values seemed to have completely changed.I'm only suggesting that maybe Meg should have wrote an ENTIRELY new novel instead of a sequel. Different characters and everything, not connected to All-American Girl, so that fans of the first book would not be suprised, and oerhaps offended, by the unexpected insight into Samantha Madison's sex life."
1,Extreme letdown.,"I love all of Meg Cabots books, and am always thrilled to hear when a new one is coming out. As I was with this one. After reading it I was totally appalled. ALL-AMERICAN GIRL was awesome, a sweet clean story. Sadly it seems Meg is turning toward the realm of society and accepting teen sex. Being a teen, I am sick of this immoral stuff being pushed constantly in my face. Ready or Not demonstrates this, making girls feel that if they are in a relationship it is EXPECTED to being having sex. If you are considering wasting $10 to buy this, save it for a better book. This is Megs worst book. For girls that read this, it totally sends the wrong image of what a relationship should be. It's sad that the best writers have to turn to ""sex sells"" to up a book's status."
1,Ready or Not,"I was very disappointed in this book. Girls who read ""All American Girl"" would expect the same humorous, fun plot line. Unfortunately, this is not for the same age girls who read ""All American Girl."" The ending is extremely stupid and *spoiler warning* the girl's sister teaches her how to masturbate. Really, Meg?! Why the plot change?This book is not worth .01!"
2,Too Pushy,"I LOVE Meg Cabot as an author.I greatly enjoyed the first All-American Girl book, and was eager to get the second one.The book is entertaining, but I do not like the subject matter in which the story centered around.The main character, Sam, is deciding on wether to 'go all the way' with her boyfriend David.I do not believe that Meg gave a round-about enough view of this subject, and think that she presented it in a one-sided view.As such a strong voice for teen influence, Meg should have thought about her words, and should have used them to educate teens about safe alternatives.I am very disappointed, Meg."
2,dissapointed,"let me just start by saying that i am a huge Meg Cabot fan. i've read almost everything by her. but this one wasn't a good addition to all her great work. the plot of this book can be summed up in one word, sex. Samantha Madison spends all of her time trying to decide whether she will or won't have sex with her boyfriend David (the president's son) after a while it just gets old and the book becomes pretty bland. i suggest you don't waste your money on this one."
3,Best it Could Be,"if any other author wrote this, it would be a piece of trash, but as it is meg cabot, it is done well, even if the plot line wasn't exactly wonderful. it drives me nuts when people say it 'was a waste of time' and 'promotes teen sex'. i didn't think it promoted anything, it just sent the message that teens having sex didn't mean that they were bad people. it also (to me) said that this was samantha's decsision, and other people were hindering her and making her feel guilty. it DID NOT say that it was okay for kids to have sex nor was it 'apalling'. in order to know what message it sends to teen and preteen girls you need to be one, and also, education is not a bad thing. a ten-year-old shouldn't have sex, but that doesn't mean that her parents and teachers shouldn't educate her about it. i really appreciate this book because it didn't try to cover-up the aspect of teen life that teens themselves are usually too embarrased to ask about."
1,Politcal propaganda for the extreme left wing!,"anyone notice how the mean girls in this novel were apart of a group called ""right way"" ??? as in...""right WING""???? yeah.. it does get kind of old quickly how she's like ""should i have sex with him, or shouldn't i?"" and i mean, like, that's THE WHOLE NOVEL. he, the one she might have sex with, is hardly SEEN in the novel. the only rewarding aspect of the novel was her sister's new love. and the whole cafeteria scene..yeah way fake! it was just a bad book, aimed at..well marketing ideas to young impressionable girls. i mean, i'm not saying that sex is EVIL. but this is so shamelessly spoon feeding ideals to girls, that, its unforgivable!!"
1,please don't let daughter's read,"i just finished reading 'pants on fire' which was a really cute book. i was excited to see what else meg cabot has done. i read this book and skimmed the whole thing. i was very upset that the whole book focused on her big night of losing her virginity. there are some of us that still believe that sex is sacred - for a forever commitment with one person. this book made me really mad. morals are changing in our world and girls need to be warned and taught, but it should not be encouraged! i will be very hesitant with her books in the future."
1,Trash,"The trash is exactly where I put this book. I bought it for my 14 year old daughter because we both loved the first ""All American Girl"" book. This sequel was such a disappointment. The Sam from the first book was gone and replaced by some girl we didn't know. My daughter looked it over when it came and then brought it to me saying, ""Mom, I don't think you want me to read this, it's all about sex."" And boy was she right. I couldn't believe it when I read it."
1,After what,"I loved the first book I loved all of the first book. But this book is just so well blah blah blah it was increasling annoying and rather predictable. I, grew to love Sam and feel her feelings in the first book but really come on. I mean all the things that made the first book good were gone. I mean Cant we have more of a complex thingie. Really Meg cuz this book suxed"
2,Don't waste your money,"Arrived incorrectly assembled and with no obvious way to correct it. Manufacturer does not respond to email requests for assistance. Instructions specify that target must be at least 30 yards from shooter. That's an absurd restriction on what is supposed to be a handgun target, where typical practice or competition distances are less than 50 feet."
1,Strings felt aweful,"I bought these strings thinking they would look cool on my guitar to give it that black on black look. That was the only good thing about these strings. The strings felt like they were made out of plastice, and bending the strings made it sound aweful. I will never buy these again."
1,Looks awesome......performance terrible!!!,At first sight the strings were awesome. After only about 1 week of use the coating started coming off of some of the strings. Also broke a string after about 2 weeks. Not happy with the quality of this product at all!!!
2,Coating off in 2 days!!,"The manufacturer states that the coating can hold up to most picks. The box cautions the user to be careful during installation and states that the coating will not hold up to certain pick materials like metal picks (cymbal brass, finger picks, and the like.) I was very careful to install my strings as my guitar has a ""string through body"" design. I inspected the strings after they passed through the body, and again after they passed through the tuning pegs. After verifying the strings were undamaged, I tuned and played (Using a nylon pick of strong/hard resilience. After 2 sessions of around an hour an a half each, very obvious wear had taken place on almost all of the strings in the area of my picking. I have not contacted the manufacturer as I had spoken with a few people who are familiar with strings and they all believe it to be a design flaw, and not a manufacturing defect. I liked the sound of the strings when I started, but that sound changed the more I played."
5,Great Read,"This was a really good romance novel. The main character was posing as an escort in order to find her missing sister. While on her quest she runs into a hunky cajun bartender. The romance was great in this book and the main characters were great, the only thing wrong with this book was that the plot of finding the sister fizzled out, the character went to all this trouble looking for her sister and it seems to me she was fine the whole time it was kind of weak. However, like I said the romance between the main characters was definitely enough to keep this book going it was a story that i will read again and I am looking forward to reading more by Toni Blake."
3,"Cute toy, but hard-to-push buttons","I got this toy for my 26-month-old son for Christmas. He loves buses. He likes the music and the flashing lights on this bus. However it is difficult to press the buttons. It took me a while to figure out how to turn it on. There is an ""On"" sticker in one of the windows of the bus. However it doesn't look like a button. I pressed it several times and it didn't do anything, so I assumed it was just a decal. I then pressed it really hard and it turned on. My son sometimes has trouble with it. He'll keep pressing the ""On"" window over and over, and because his fingers are small and doesn't hit the exact location of the button, it doesn't turn on. He'll then bring it to me to do. The buttons on the side and top also have to be pressed with a little force in order for it to speak or make the sounds. When it does work my son loves it. I just wish it was a little easier for small children to operate."
1,Not one of the best due to the quality of sound,"This CD is not one of my favorites, not because of the songs, but the quality of the production. You are not able to hear the richness of Gordon Lightfoot's voice like you do on Gord's Gold and If You Could Read My Mind. His voice, in addition to his ability to paint pictures with his words, is one of the reasons I have loved him since I first heard Gord' Gold on vinyl as a child.The United Artists Collection does have on it many songs I had yet to hear on other albums. They are much more ""folksy"" and less lyrical in my opinion."
5,Wonderful collection of Gordon Lightfoot!,"I have most of his albums, but THIS is the best summation of his work! Excellent cross section of this great Canadian artist's style and technique. Great value--On two full CD's. I highly recommend this album!"
5,Early Lightfoot,"Fantastic Collection. First four albums on 2 CDs. Original versions (Best hits stuff is re-recorded). This is his voice at its finest. Later stuff does not include ""The Last Time ...."""
5,On Gordon Lightfoot's U A Collection,"Conspicuously absent from this collection are GL's greatest hits. Since they still get plenty of air play that is no loss. What is left are numerous mid-charters and diamonds in the rough that make playing and replaying this cd like tuning in to a favorite radio station for the first time.GL mixes social and political commentary with beautiful romantic music. Especially impressive is ""Black Day in July"" about the 1967 riots in Detroit. ""Song for a Winter's Night"" drips with sensuousness.Even though this music precedes the hits, artistically it picks up where they leave off."
5,Breathtaking!!!,"This cd set is beyong words- almost 150 minutes of great music from a young (at that time) canadian singer/songwriter. This is the collection of the first 4 albums Lightfoot recorded for UA (the fithth album he did for that studio, ""Live"", is missing from this collection)in the late 60'ies. This cet includes so many great songs - i wont even bother writing them down. This is pure gold - taken from the prime of the singer/songwriter movement. This is acoustic brilliance. So, 49 great songs, 150 minutes of joy, 2 cd set=$11.49? well, in this case yes! Go get it!!!"
1,Ridiculously priced,"It's outrageous to ask twice as much for an MP3 album as for the CD set. What is that a fee for burning it for us. With that said, I bought the cd set years ago, now it's scratched and I am buying it again. This is one of my favorite collection. I'll burn the mp3 myself though, thanks."
5,Great!!,This is a great collection of the greatest folk singer/writer's songs. Some are not heard that much. Highly recommend for anyone that likes Gord or good music.
3,Not sure !,After I started using this my Nails started Peeling really bad! and I went from Long nails to sort nails in a week. But Im really not sure why.I have a full bottle and Im not sure if I will try it again just to make sure that this really was the cause of my nail problems or Not!
3,OK product but bad smell,"I don't like the smell at all, it's kinda disgusting and needs a long time to get used to it.Good result though.I mixed it with gelish cuticle oil and the smell became endurable."
3,Haven't really noticed a difference,"I've been using this SolarOil for a couple months now and I really haven't noticed a difference. I've still gotten a few hang nails. I'm going to keep using it though. Nails take a long time to grow, so maybe there's still hope. I do like the smell & the brush applicator."
3,more from cusco,"if you love cusco music, you'll probably like this disc. it's more of the same basic cusco sound which you will no doubt appreciate, but not as good as others, such as cusco 2000"
3,"""Pop"" New Age: failed to grasp me, for the most part","This album by Cusco definitely failed to grasp me. It tries to be epic at times, it tries to sound like Wollenweider other times, it wants to sound like the music from the Bolivian Andes and it misses the point most of the time. ""Lake Erie,"" a song based on a Simon & Garfunkel theme, ""Lake of the Ozarks"" and ""Aurora"" were the only three songs that I really enjoyed. Sorry, Cusco fans, but to me this album was more like ""pop"" new age for the most part. For REAL new age, please go to Vangelis, Kitaro, Jean-Michel Jarre or some of Windham Hill's acts."
4,This deserves to be better known,"I first saw this film in Paris, in English, at a late-night theatre on the Champs Elysées, when it was first released.I thought ""Wow,that was a real piece of life drama"".I then bought the video cassette and showed it to my wife, who also thought it was great and truly original.So now I am buying the DVD so that I can watch it again on a big screen and show it to more people, I'm sure they will recognise themselves or somebody they know amongst the characters."
3,allcanadianguy@shaw reviews * * *,"Who would like this? : mystery,crime,drama & movie buffsWorth seeing...-buy it : yes-rent it : yes* Anthony LaPagliaGeoffrey RushBarbara HersheyKerry ArmstrongRachael BlakeVince Colosimo*great cast & story."
5,Masterpiece,"I have watched this movie so many times and every time I see facts and details I missed before. It is about us human beings, our souls, the way we have to deal with every day life and the fact that we are just put on this earth and try and make the best of it, in that same life, in love and our relations.The story is unbelievable in the way the people and their stories are intertwined but it all makes sense in theend. Bravo for this movie, the actors and the script; I find it an extraordinary film aboutthe psychology of us, of me and the way we see and interpret what we see as reality - if there is one."
1,Be Warned,"This movie has gotten a lot of good reviews and it won some awards, and so I thought that it would be a good choice to make as long as the price was reasonable (I got it for $3.99). I expected to enjoy the movie but I was bored with it from beginning to end. So there's a chance that other people will be bored by it as well.The good news is that the acting is excellent throughout, especially from Anthony LaPaglia. The actors do everything that they can to bring each scene to life. Yet very few scenes in this film ever do spring to life. All the numerous characters ever do is mope around and look forlorn and writhe in existential pain. The movie unfolds in an unyielding monotone of glumness.I stayed with this film until the end, sighing in exasperation throughout. Then I put the dvd back in its case and placed it in the trash."
3,Domestic Staleness a Bit Overdone,"Contrary to the sterling critical reviews I've read, I see this film as a mild disappointment. The story is clear but seems implausible because of the far-fetched coincidences. But worse, the characters, who are all edgy and on the brink of despair and loneliness, are drawn too akwardly and abruptly so that the result is that many scenes come across as maudlin. Also, the movie's pace, especially the first half, is slow and plodding. Having said that, there is much to admire in this film. The theme of domestic ennui, trust, forgiveness, and the conflict between passion and security. Secondly, the story line is compelling enough. And finally, the performances are fine, by actors who look like real people and not glitzy Hollywood models.I've heard Lantana is being called ""The Australian Short Cuts,"" as it's compared to Robert Altman's masterpiece. I for one would not go this far."
3,Not that great,"I'd been looking forward to seeing this movie after catching some previews & after a friend raved about it.I liked Ray Lawrence's ""Bliss"", & it seemed to have all the ingredients but unfortunately, for me, it was a real let down. Anthony LaPaglia acts like he's doing rehearsals & delivers a flat performance. Geoffrey Rush is always very average in my opinion, & Barbara Hershey just plays Barbara Hershey. Vince Colosimo & Peter Phelps are the REAL stars here.It's a poor man's Robert Altman-movie; where all these different characters/lives meet up somewhere along the line. ""Magnolia"" did that sort of thing,you know,& did it better.The screenplay,here,is very disappointing and early on it all becomes pretty darn predictable. Some good Lawrence-esque scenes here & there but,generally,the film lacks real soul & drags out too much."
4,Worth Watching,"I watched this film last night. The first 30 minutes I couldn't make sense of why we were having to watch all these different characters and I wasn't sure it was going to be a very good movie. Then it starts to jell and come together as I continued to watch.This is a film for adults only. There are no car chases, shoot-outs, or computerized special effects. If you like good dialogue and a great story you'll like this film. I love a film that can actually surprise me with plot twists, and this film did."
4,Very pleasant surprise,"This one flew completely under the radar for me when it was in the theaters. It's great. Some off the top of my head points of comparison: It's like Magnolia in that its a semi-interconnected ensemble, but it's lesslong and plodding. It's like Go and Pulp Fiction in that it's somewhat puzzle-like, butit's not interested in being wacky or youthful. And it's got some of the bleak sexualityand wistfulness of Mulholland Drive without being completely inscrutable."
5,Exquisite! Wonderfull! Astonishing,"I am not a fan of Eureka 7, have never seen the anime, too busy to relax, anyways I am a big of collecting Anime Figures of Girls only, this is an amazing figure 1/6 tall bigger than Jo from burst angel series and bigger than Carmen From Gun X Sword... I can tell you this figure i really worth a lot and is really beautifull dont miss the chance to own it, eventhough you dont like the Series, but the details are awesome!"
5,Wisdom and comedy,"It is not a bad thing that our most accessible source of wisdom is from late night TV comics. Our country celebrates newness and individual innovation, and the cleverness of the late night comic and his guests is a welcome antidote to the tawdry news that precedes it. But we have thousands of years of insight to draw on, also created as a counterpoint to distracting times, the cumulative ideas of a great religion. In this book, Rabbi Edward Feinstein brings us both kinds of wisdom. A colorful and brisk survey of Jewish thought, the book conveys Jewish teachings through the lens of a very modern mind, to the sensibilities of a skeptical adolescent, through the humor and pathos that makes a great comic. I loved the book for myself, and giving out two to each Bar Mitzvah- one to the kid, and one to the parents!"
3,"Purchased for dog treats, not what I expected.","I purchased this flour because my dogs eat a grain free diet, and I like to make them homemade treats (it's cheaper). The potato flour just doesn't work as well as the chickpea flour - the dogs still ate the treats happily, but it was a stickier mess when making them. I won't buy again."
3,NOT Potato Starch,"This is NOT Potato Starch, it is potato flour. It's really only good for thickening soups and sauces, not for baking. It's certainly a good price, compared to what you'd find at a health food store. For Potato Starch (unfortunately not yet a ""Subscribe and Save"" item, see this:Bob's Red Mill Potato Starch, 24-ounces (Pack of4)"
3,Disappointing history of Reconstruction,"I was very disappointed in Franklin's book. Having read numerous books on Reconstruction prior to his, I was hopeful that he, as an African-American, would bring a unique and challenging perspective to the subject. In my estimation he failed and I'm very sorry for that, because I expecting more based on Franklin's reputation as a pre-eminent historian. In comparison to other books on Reconstruction, read before and after his, I'm sorry to agree with others and state this is not a well written examination of a very important period in American history. I had sincerely hoped for better from him and didn't get it."
2,Hardly much fun,"Why did I purchase this set? Not for Chopin or Field, but for disc no 4, in particular for Szymanowska and Dobrzynski, who are kind of difficult to get. And the verdict is that their music is lovely but I have no other recordings to compare it to. However, this interpretation/production of Chopin and Field on the other hand are rather average, so my conclusion is-keep searching for other recordings of Szymanowska and Dobrzynski and good luck with that."
4,cat scratching post,My 2 cats have been having a great time with this scratching post. The interactive toys on the post make it more attractive for the cats' use. Unfortunately they have gotten carried away on occasion and have been able to knock it over.
5,Nice!!,"This is a very well made messenger bag from HP. Works exactly as its intended to. Don't be swayed by negative reviews. Yes the handle on the top causes the bag to lean when you are holding it as opposed to using the strap, but i deal with it."
4,Fresh New Talent for the Regency Genre,"War-weary Lord Langdon returns to England after the war to find his estate and finances in great disorder. He also finds his younger brother in the clutches of the inappropriate yet very attractive Nel Ashley, who has the nerve to criticize him for the neglect of his family, his people and his estate. A series of Austin-esque misunderstandings and one very seductive kiss send both down the enchanted garden path to true love. Despite their misunderstandings, the passion between these two characters is palpable.Ms. Greene's first book is well-researched and very well-written. She is a promising new voice for the Regency genre and I look forward to reading her next book!"
1,Endless drivel of a regency,"I thought this book would never end...What a silly story about people I could care less about. James Mayland, our hero, is a drip. Nell, our heroine, is sanctimonious, homely and boring. James' brother, Darcy, is found kissing James' fiancee after hehad proposed to Nell and was waiting for her answer. He says, well, sorry. That is supposed to be okay? James really love Nell, Nell really loves James, Darcy loves James' finacee, Constance, Constance loves Darcy. It gave me a headace and this book was not in the least amusing. I never even smiled once while reading it! What a waste."
5,The Single Greatest Lab Manuel Ever!!,"Constantine Zois has done it again. He's crafted a lab manual of such pure beauty and sheer passion that how can you look away. THIS MAN KNOWS RIPTIDES.Every page just bleeds the heart of a man that wants to open up the beauty that is the ocean. From fish to oil spills, from sea to shinning sea let Constantine Zois's lab manual stand as the single greatest tome on the subject of Oceanography. The Library of Congress should put this masterwork next to the Bible, as the second greatest piece of literature ever (third would be the diary of Anne Frank.).Mr. Zois I salute you and your inspiring work. WE could all find better solutions to the world's problems if we would give Mr. Zois Lab Manual a chance."
5,A must see...,This is a must see for teens. Also a great movie to start a dialogue with students or children in the classroom. Give it to your child's school's media center. Buy one for you too.
3,Teenages will probably be more interested in the movie than the book,Teens would rather watch a movie but the book gives more indepth view of the suffering of bullied kids. I do think the book and the movie could be very good teaching tools in many schools. Even first graders know a bully in their school and although being a nurse i realize these kids have issues not related to the bullying that need to be addressed. These bullies are the kids that are just as likely to show up with a gun at school as the ones they pick on.
3,mild storm,"I have been a fan of Margaret Maron for years--beginning with her NY series--and now always preorder the Deborah Knott volumes. While certain parts of the story were well up to her best, especially the storm watching and writing minister's son, I was disappointed with the lack of growth in our knowledge of the large Knot family. There were excellant scenes with Kezzie, the daddy of the clan, but the others including cousin Reid--the maybe suspect--seemed very shallow. The mystery itself was OK but predictable, although I reread a couple of key pages several times and do not yet feel that the ending ""reasoning"" tracked. I would recommend this book as a good diversion read but not a great one like so many of her others."
4,Entertaining,"I read this book on a recent plane trip. I've been reading Maron's Deborah Knott books since the beginning of the series and this is one of the better ones. I don't like the ending, though. It seemed too easy. One of the charms of this series how Maron talks about Knott's large family. You're actually able to tell her 12 brothers apart! And there are a few poignant passages about Knott's mother, who died when she was a teenager. In fact, the only book in the series that I really didn't enjoy was one that didn't discuss her family. It is called Killer Market and it is about the North Carolina furniture market. Anyway, this is a good book. It's not high literature, but it's not trying to be. It was entertaining and it gave me something to do during a boring plane ride (and it's nice that we have boring plane rides, isn't it?)."
3,Winds of Change,"STORM TRACK by Margaret Maron falls into the category that if you write about the coast somewhere you must include a hurricane. I'm not sure what put this title at the bottom of my Maron titles, but it lacked a spark to excite interest.Yes, there is a murder and Judge Knott finds the right clues, but you often wonder how she got there. Maybe Ms. Maron was writing to fulfill contract obligations instead of remembering fan expectations want a strong story. Still any Margaret Maron is a good read.Nash Black, author of QUALIFYING LAPS."
1,Indian Headress that falls apart,OK this is the second time I have had to write this review. Please do not ask me again. The thing fell apart as soon as I removed it from the box. I literally had to sit for over an hour and re-hot glue almost every single feather into that thing. I would rather pay a higher price to be sure that it doesn't all apart. Shoddy workmanship. If you don't mind rebuilding the thing yourself go ahead and purchase it.
4,Flashing Swords full of fun,"This is classic sword and sorcery with a dash of fun. Those who criticize it on literary grounds do not know what they are talking about.You can't go wrong with Leiber and Poul Anderson, and Lin Carter's addition shows real imagination, while spoofing the whole genre.In fact, the ""omniscient"" viewpoint is perfect for this kind of story."
5,Amazed,I am a 17 year old teen who has loved this movie ever since I laid eyes on it. I remember the year they stopped showing it on tv. I was heartbroken. I had it on tape but not for the vcr we had. I was and still am amazed that I found this video. This is an awesome tape along with the comedy of horrors one which I am sure both will be watched to extinction. It is great for the whole family to sit and watch together.
5,Seen it on TV years ago and miss it !,"My husband and I searched everywhere for this video. Our favorite parts are the ""Carol of the Bells"" and ""Waffle, Waddle,Wallow, Wassle."" This video would sell like hot cakes if it was to come out. We have a CD and it is the first Cd we listen to every Christmas season. We want to show this video to our children especialy our nine year old who has never seen it. We'd watch it all year long."
2,A very big dissapointment...,I was very excited to get this video but to my dissapointment it was not what I was expecting. The video itself is kind of cute but overall it was rather boring. I was specially surprised at the quality of the video itself. The picture is fussy as if it was taped in EP instead of standard play. Overall I was NOT happy with this purchase.
5,My favorite Christmas special!,"I taped this off TV years ago when my nephew was little and we play it every year. He's 17 now and just found out his girlfriend has never seen it, so I dug out the tape and he'll introduce it to her this week. I was hoping to buy a copy, as mine looks a bit worn."
5,Thank You Mr.Vinton...I'm A Kid Again!,"Claymation Christmas Celebration is one of the best Christmas specials ever produced. It ranks up there with Rudolph ""the red nosed"" Reindeer, Frosty the Snowman and It's Christmas Charlie Brown. A great video for the whole family. VERY FUNNY! As for the Amazon.com review, I'd like to know what crawled up her Stocking! Trust me...you and your kids will love it."
4,one of my favorate parts of christmas,"one of my favorate parts of the Christmas season is all the classic shows and movies, like ""scrooged"", and ""Christmas Vacation."" I have this show on tape back to back with Garfield's Christmas special. We were so lucky to get them both on tape. This is always the first Christmas video we watch every year the Friday after Thanksgiving. Every number in this special is sweet and funny, such as the jazzy camels in ""We three Kings,"" the incompetant bell of ""Carol of the bells"", the ballet walruses in ""Angels we have heard on high"" and the rendetion of ""Joy to the world"" Of coarse, today, with the California Raisens, this show may seem dated, but it is still a enjoyable welcome into the Christmas season at my house"
5,A Memorable Movie,"This is by far one of the most memorable Christmas movies yet. I have watched this every year since it came out and still laugh. This is the type of movie that someone doesn't forget, like Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer and Frosty the Snowman. The Camels are great, as are the Crazy Bells. Definitely a movie to add to the collection. Can't wait until it gets put on DVD. As for the person that reviewed this, they definitely don't have an imagination nor a sense of humor."
5,This is the best Christmas special in the whole universe!,"This show is THE holiday special. I am sooo happy that it is being sold here, because my copy is getting worn out from being watched over and over. I mean, how better to hear ""We Three Kings"" than when it is being sung by camels? That, and the California Raisins doing their rendition of ""Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer"" is what forces me to take this tape every year and watch it. And NOBODY knows how to kill a pesky blue flea like Dumbbell does. Nobody.I suggest that all fans of Will Vinton's works should e-mail him (www.vinton.com) and BEG him to put this back on the air for the next millenium. Also, a sequel! We need more Christmas specials hosted by dinosaurs!""I told you there was a Christmas song about snacks."""
5,Eureka!,"I am so excited to finally find this video! I will never forget watching this on tv when I was younger! We absolutely loved it. Recently my husband mentioned that he also watched this as a child and loved it. We are so disappointed that it's not on television anymore! This is the probably the best Christmas special I have ever seen! I love it! The camels are great! If you haven't seen it, you at least need to check out the camels!"
5,This one is still alive,"Holy Cow! How did I miss this guy. I had the pleasure to see S.R. Vaughn and Buddy Guy, Danny Gatton left us before I knew who he was. Bobby Radcliff is one of them and he is alive and well in New York. Plays the local clubs in N.J. and N.Y. And still teaches guitar lessons. This album is ""Blistering"" and damn! he can sing. This is his first album and the following cd's are even (hard to believe)better. He knocked arround DC in the 80's w Danny Gatton and borrowed a few licks, good for him...most players couldnt do them justice, Bobby Radcliff can. Superstar on the edge here. Don't wait! get this record!"
2,Light is only so-so,"I ordered this with high hopes since my children were forever forgetting to turn the flashlight to off and using up the batteries. Well, you have to turn the crank for a very long time and the result is a rather weak light. The siren is loud, but I'm not sure if it will ever come into use. The radio is also only so-so, static, medium volume. Using the solar energy means keeping the thing under full daylight for hours. Even with those complaints it would be okay for an emergency, as long as you don't get it wet. Mine got wet from some splashed water in the kitchen and it died soon after. I think I'm going to try the flashlight that you shake to work."
3,Ok but...,"The radio works fine, and I haven't managed to break the crank. If I can find an LED upgrade for the bulb, the flashlight might be fine with the built in rechargeable, but as is you really need REAL batteries to use the flashlight."
4,"Fun, but for younger kids","The recommended age on this was for Ages 7 and up so we bought this for my son who is really into Legos (he's 7 1/2). It is a really cute game but it's very simple...probably more for kids who are 5 years old or even younger if they are able to put the little Lego pieces together. Other than that, I'd recommend it."
2,Very Disappointed,I am used to Kerri providing lovely mood piano music. This vocal album reminded me more of a country western recording. It will probably go to the back of my music closet and not be played very much. I am VERY disappointed in this effort by Kerri.
4,Peaceful and Relaxing,"Very eloquent voice and relaxing music by Kerri Sherwood. Her voice sounds a little bit like Juice Newton - whose CD I also own. I would recommend this CD to those who enjoy the fine art of music.Apparently, another reviewer must have received a defective CD as I did not hear any ""mammals in heat"" or ""squealing pigs"" on mine."
5,Stunning in both performance and recorded quality!,"This is just a really fun recording! The first time through, be mindful of the volume knob on your stereo. Some of the drum beats might shoot you clean out of the house! What I mean is, it's dynamic as can be, with a very real sense of the performance taking place right in your room. I guess my review is just as much about the musical presence that Babatundi visits upon us as the care and effort with which Chesky Records used in the recording of this great musician.I can't help but feel uplifted when I play this CD!"
4,Excellent; We Need More,"Speakers are easy to understand; speech is at normal rate, rather than the exagerratedly slow rate of most language CDs or tapes. I used to be fluent in my language but lost my last speaking partner 9 years ago & so while I can still speak, I don't 'hear' well. CDs like this help greatly in preserving my language for me as well as teaching in a good way; not the stilted artificial way of the majority culture.Now if Albert White Hat Sr would put together some CDs of conversational Lakhota... Maybe in story form? Would not have to be our Traditional tales, but I supposed could be. That would do much to help preserve our language & fluency in it, too. Wopila tanka - Mitakuye oiasin."
1,Not enough,"The book is well meant but there isn't enough in it to really learn our language. I have had it for years and read it back and forth but it doesn't teach that much. And I see too much of the non-native editor behind some of the work. I don't understand why the female voice on the CD (most likely that of the editor) is a non-native speaker with strong English accent. And I was never able to pronounce words written in the orthography, I think it is too complicated. I recently started learning from theNew Lakota Dictionary, the orthography in it is so much easier to read and there is so much more in it to learn the language and the culture."
3,Good for some . . .,"This book is good for some, but not for me. I did not exactly care for the set-up of this textbook. Instead of your typical language in which the lessons are set-up based on dialogues and grammar notes, this text systematically goes through the Lakota alphabet through the WHOLE book. I though that this approach limited the scope of the book and the content that was covered.The historical/social insights are good, but the overall layout of the book could have been better. Perhaps this would make a good supplement, but I don't think it would make a good textbook by itself."
1,:( pretty bad,"Since I found much repetition in this book, I copied all relevant info (except pronounciation examples) into a notebook. Well, page six was blank, there waas nothing more to write. This book will teach you forms of address, and its great for teaching pronunciation, but apart from that it just teaches conjugation and colors. Whatever it cost, you will get a Lakota phonetics course for that price."
2,"They call him boss....BOSS ""N"" WORD!!!","This is a movie that I KNEW was gonna be a hoot!BOY WAS I WRONG!!!!It was too serious to be funny ant too funny to be serious. The acting from Boss was great but there was too much silly stuff and the sund quality was not great, even for an older movie.I think a remake would be good. Make it serious with just a few jokes in it."
2,Mr Clymer will LIE to you!,"I know this isn't the Honda OEM manual, but I expected atleast a little bit of accuracy. I wasted 8 hours one day troubleshooting an electrical issue because THE WIRING DIAGRAM IN THE BACK OF THE BOOK IS WRONG!!!I have since found 4 other errors in this manual.I know its more expensive, but buy the original Honda service manual from Helm, Inc. instead."
1,Honda Manuel,I ordered a Honda Manuel for a 1978 Honda CB 550. I received a manuel for a 1983 honda CB550. I book is of little value to me. The real problem is that I still do not have a manuel for my 1978 honda CB550
4,Hanes Hoody's,"I was pleasantly surprised about the quality of the hoody's. There were soft and thick, perfect for winner weather. The large was pretty big, so the next time I will purchase a size smaller. Overall, it was a good purchase."
5,Good quality,"I needed a white, mostly cotton hoodie just so I could tie dye it. This one is nice and thick, doesn't feel cheap at all."
1,Out of date,"I enjoyed and used the first and second editions of this book throughout the 80s and into the 90s, but hey, Columbia! Many years have passed since the third edition was published! The world has changed. The Cold War is over and the Internet is central to our lives.Clearly the publisher has decided never to update or republish what was for a while a very useful book. Columbia has made the full sixth edition of the unabridged encyclopedia available online for free at encyclopedia.com, so this dated reference work no longer serves any purpose."
4,Great Collection,"I think this is one of the better compilations I've seen. I've really been impressed with all of the Oxford World's Classics series. The information given in the Introduction as well as the maps and reference materials mentioned are very helpful. In addition I like having the notes listed at the end of the compilation rather then interspersed, I find it less distracting that way. A must have for any Greek Literature Scholar."
4,Underappreciated.,"Frankly, I really do enjoy this anime, which may seem kind of odd since it's of a little slower pace and a little vague, like you've been dropped in the middle of a story. But they do tell you things gradually and by the end you're going ""Ooooh, well dude"" and it makes a lot more sense. But it's interesting that it's set up that way, and how few characters it really, really focuses on. The relationship between Rei and Yukikaze is also quite interesting, almost like a love story but not quite.I do recommend this anime. If you're into really fast paced animes then this might drive you a little up the wall, but it doesn't have it's interesting points and you want to see what happens next, to know what happens in the end, to find out what happens to Rei and Yukikaze. The fight sequences are also pretty capturing, I enjoyed them, and the ending is left open for you to go ""What if?"" and ""This might have happened this or that way"", etc. It's an interesting anime."
3,It was ok...,"The message shared in this movie is relevant. However, the film may be a bit outdated. I rate it 2.5-3 depending upon your level of understanding of social issues."
3,It is just ok...,"I have bought this case expecting a solid outside and a padded interior, like the Fender SKB case I have. But it is very different as it is not so rigid and its interior is very poor. Does it protect your snare drum? Yes, it does. But for this price, you should look for something that does a better work."
1,Don't Buy It,"Consider another receiver before buying Delorme's. Delorme's receiver works only with their software (the receiver does not conform to any standard, unlike most other receivers.) The Delorme software itself is not very accurate. Just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home, I found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is - but Microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly. Finally, with the receiver I have, even after the device as been initialized, Delorme's software sometimes is unable to find it. (I suspect that is because the cable on the GPS side sometimes pulls slightly out, but fiddling with it doesn't seem to accomplish much). Real irritating out on the road, as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages."
1,DONT BUY IT,"This thing does not work!The software is passable, but the GPS will not work. I own 4 laptops, and it only works on one out of the four. Delorme's answer? ""Newer laptosps dont put out enough voltage on USB, only use it on older laptops"" COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!No online help, no tollfree number, long times on ""hold"" waiting for a tech on a toll call, and after all that... the answer is ""buy our bluetooth version, or use an older laptop""."
1,Second Generation Earthmate,"I have been using the Delorme stuff for a few years with great sucess until i purchased a new earthmate in October 99.(to replace the one i gave to a friend) The 2nd generation earthmate has embossed information on the underside rather than a black tag. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUY THIS PRODUCT! It does not work and Delorme is unable or unwilling to do any thing about it! The only sugestion was ""return it and buy a better quality gps receiver"" This system is running on a 450 mgz toshiba laptop installed in a Limousine."
1,Poor Tracking Selection,"1. The Earthmate does a very poor job of maintaining the track at speeds above 35 MPH or with even slight interferrence from buildings, bridges, etc. Before the Earthmate I had a small Magellan GPS that cost less and did a much better tracking job. Unfortunately it was stollen out of my car (along with the car).2. I bought the Earthmate for use with my Palm but when I upgraded to an M500, there was no adapter cable. DeLorme has still not provided one."
1,Eegad!,"With such a promising beginning and a story that could easily have written itself, one has to ask...How could you blow it in such a big way. I sat in horror indeed, grasping my head firmly in my hands, rocking back and forth violently crying, ""Why did he ever get out of the truck and show himself?"" So many great ideas crashed through my head during the first part of the movie as to what our friendly neighborhood killer could be, and what he was attempting to accomplish. I more than once found myself muttering repeatedly ""What the Hell!"". In short, this movie found new ways to violate me...don't let it happen to you."
3,Well.......,"I was really excited when I first saw this movie advertised on tv...then I saw it. It was okay but I was a bit disappointed. This could of been a ""GREAT"" movie. For instance, the brother and sister do some really dumb things in the movie such as watching in awe as the creeper kills a cop, and they just stand/and or sit there! Let's hope Jeepers Creepers 2 turns out to be a lot better. Then maybe I can give the series at least 4 stars."
1,... so BAD!!,"At first I was so exited to see this movie because the trailer kinda made it interesting...so me, my brother,sister and sister-in-law went to see it..it was interesting the first few minutes...then from then on it started to get boring one by one...the ending was so stupid they cut it from there...then after that,all four of us,thought that was a DUMB MOVIE...I totally agreed..this is the worst movie I have seen in a long time...the only reason I gave it atleast one star its because it was able to make me jump on some parts...but take it from me...THIS MOVIE IS A STUPID WASTE!! of money and time..."
1,AWFUL,"OK-the first 10-15 minutes are pretty good, after that-walk out. Made no sense, about as scary and predictable as Blair Witch 2!?!? Every cliche in the book-shoulda been straight to video-if that. They don't make them like they used to."
1,"Awful, Awful",Waste of time and money. Not scary. By the end we were hoping for both of the protagonist to die a painful and grusome death.
1,Horrible,"One of the worst movies ive seen in a long time. Really not a whole lot else to say. Thin plot, bad acting, and a horrible ending. Definately did not live up to the hype."
1,Jeepers Creepers,"This was the WORST movie I have seen in a long time!!! Where do I begin? The plot was weak, the writing was awful, and the editing was terrible. Let's start with the first encounter with the Creeper on the highway. Although the Creeper rams the car repeatedly it appears without a scratch several times during the chase sequence. This was the first clue that I was watching a really bad ""B"" movie. The writing--Most of the audience wasn't sure if they should be laughing or if they were supposed to be screaming. There was nothing scary about this film. It was unfortunately funny in places I don't think the director intended. The anti-climactic ending sucked also. I wish I had my money back on this one........I could have done something better with it like burn it!!!!! That would have been more productive."
1,Was this movie supposed to make any sense?,"At the begining of the movie, the monster mysteriously appears driving an old truck, and there's no explanation of who he is, or where he came from!! Later on in the movie we see that this creature has wings which alows him to fly, so why has he been driving a truck?!When the police finally find him, they shoot him but the bullets don't have any effect on him. So how are they supose to kill him? Buy this movie and watch it to the end and you still will NOT find out how to kill him.I hear there's a part two to this movie. I recomend you pass on it."
1,Is That It?,"Before I start, let me say I'm a serious fan of horror films. Good horror films. I had heard so many good things that I finally broke down and checked this ""film"" out. Apparently the rave reviews were all from people who also consider 'American Pie' to be a classic american comedy. The first 20 minutes or so of 'Jeepers Creepers' were intense and excellent. It created a mood very similar to Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Sadly, from there, it sank like a rock. A particularly heavy rock. Like so many other horror films it quickly degraded into an accidental comedy. I like a good monster movie, but this wasn't one of them. With about 30 minutes left the movie started to feel like it was being filmed without a scripted ending. As if they were ""winging it"". Terrible. Save your money."
1,Film Buff,"This is a decent horror flick for the first 60 minutes. However, it begins to get silly and the ending is a major letdown - especially when you've invested the time to get into the story. This could have been a great franchise film but instead the plot just doesn't give the 'punch' you expect from a horror film."
1,The worst US horror movie of the last 10 years.,"This is simply the worst film I have ever seen. Do yourselves a favor and don't even think about watching it, let alone buying it. The entire film is pointless and doesn't make any sense. When I watched it in the theatre people were laughing, and began talking half way through because it was so pathetic."
1,Not for intelligent movie watchers,"My husband and I saw this movie last weekend and should have walked out. I may have enjoyed this as background noise at a college holloween party, but to pay money to see it? My husband and I agreed that it was the worst movie we've seen in a theater...."
1,Had potential but lost it quickly,"I should have known better! Rarely can you hire a movie that has skipped the cinema and gone straight to DVD which is actually good. Sometimes it happens, but certainly not in the case of JEEPERS CREEPERS. The beginning is promising but the constant bickering between the brother and sister just got annoying. Justin Long's (the brother) aggression was very over the top too. Let's face it, the acting all over this film was appalling. The main problem with the film is the villain. The film loses total credibility when you see what he is - a bat-like figure with wings who hungers for human flesh, that tries to dress like a man. I mean, come on! I scanned through some scenes later on, so the film would finish more quickly. The best thing about the movie is that the brother gets knocked off in the end - he deserved it, for bickering with his sister so much!"
1,a disaster to the horror genre,This movie is seriously mucked up! I is a stupid storyline plot about 2 people who are getting taunted by a monster who likes to tear out tongues and eat eyeballs.Its the worst horror movie I've ever seen.
1,I give this movie -20 stars,"This is the worst, most unoriginal movie ever. Terrible acting. Terrible plot. Monster as scary as Mickey Mouse. I like horro movies. I like even terrible horror movies. This movie is its own genre of dung. Save a few hours of your life and watch something else. Anyone who likes this movie is a nerd and don't listen to their advice to watch it."
4,A new approach to Horror,"The opening scene alone is proberly more frightening than most horror movies are throughout . it features two kids driving back from college to spend there summer break with family but unfortunately they get a few suprises on the way when a mystery black truck appears and makes there journey a lot more than they bargained for .......this opening scene sets the pace of the movie throughout which never lets up and some cases had me jumping out of my seat if you want a good fright - look no further - just remember these words ""Jeepers Creepers where did you get them peepers - you are about to find out?........"
2,Jeepers Creepers how'd this get made?,"For a movie that starts out with an exciting car chase scene it certainly didn't develop. Without giving away the ending it's hard to write a review except to say there are too many open ended questions that go unanswered. The question of where the bad guy comes from is left completely unexplored. And more importantly who the psychic is and if ""she is ever wrong in any of her predictions.""The ending is forced and looks more like they realized they were running out of money for this production. In the end it's worth it for the beginning car chase but that is it. Turn it off after that or you'll want to charge the studio for your time.Jeepers Creepers guys how did you get a studio to fund this?"
2,They should have made this a spoof ...,"A potentially good movie, ruined by too many cliches, a bad script and the two dumbest kids in the whole of the United States. This movie could have been good - the plot idea was quite workable. However - enter the main stars of the film ... Did no-one ever tell them that it is bad for your health to stand and watch the evil guy who has spent the movie trying to kill you instead of simply driving away as fast as you can ? There are a few redeeming features to the movie - a creepy soundtrack and some good moments (though few and far between) - which save this from getting just one star ... The movie would have been better if it were another Scary Movie style spinoff, unfortunately it tries to take itself seriously."
3,Watch the first half hour or so..,"I heard alot about this movie before it cme out, so I watched it as soon as it came out on video. Like I know some people have already said the first 1/2 hour or so is great! Really chilling. Then you get the [stuff] about that psychic old lady and the ""Jeepers Creepers"" song. I really think that should have been chopped out.Then you acctually see the monster. OH MI FREAKING GOD! Its so [bad]! They should have just kept it covered up, and not let eople see it. THAT would have given it a more creepy sence. Instead you get to see the most unbelivable FLYING monster ever.Rent it, dont buy it. Watch it though, if just for the first 1/2 hour."
5,Jeepers Creepers where did you get them Peepers?,"The answer is in the movie. It is very scary, but the main characters are idiots. Oh well, at least it is scary and has a really cool bad guy. I had a probelm with the ending, but it was still good. See it!"
2,"Movie: 4/5, DVD: 1/5, Overall: 2/5.","JEEPERS CREEPERSTHE MOVIE: This was one of the best horror movies of last year. Starting like a road suspense film and making an interesting turn in going into the old 80's style monster genre, JEEPERS CREEPERS succeeds VERY successfully in making its audience exceptionally scared and totally intrigued. The acting, designs and shots in this movie are all very original and create an intense and dreading atmosphere. While it's not a masterpiece, JEEPERS CREEPERS is probably one of the most original thrillers you'll find these days. And you just can't forget that chilling final shot...THE SPECIAL FEATURES (this refers to the NZ Region 4 edition): Just a theatrical trailer. A good theatrical trailer, but that's all. Boo-hoo."
3,Jeepers Creepers,This is definitely one of those movies that would scare the crap out of anybody. Fortunately I was not scared. Had some very creepy parts but overall a good flick.
4,a must see!,"if u like some good scary movies u will enjoy watching this fine,must see thriller.Even if u are tough this (...) will scared ,well at least just a tiny part of u."
4,"oooooooohhh, scary!","I haven't seen a good movie like this in a while. I really enjoy scary movies, and this one had me on the edge of my seat! That human eating thing, whatever it was, was of the hook. Lord knows, I was thinking about it after the movie was off. It had me shooked for a min. LOL"
5,This is really creepy,"Normally horror doesn't scare me, but this one really is creepy and suspenseful. Gives you shivers!!!!"
4,Beating U Good;by Angela Jones,"Jeepers Creepers is an instant classic.All I can tell you is ,is that the ideas put into this movie are very creative ,and imaginitive.It is a must see film that should be given a better rating from more people.I'll give you some details about the movie.2 siblings brother and sister are taking the long way home when something happens.All though the movie is good it has a few things I don't understand like when the sister thinks it's a good idea to take the long way home.Other than that there are few flaws in this movie.I gave Jeepers Creepers a 4 star rating because it has few fiaws ,and a great story line.So if you want a good horror movie that can scare you to death your best choice would be Jeepers Creepers."
4,This movie is sweet!,"Jeepers creepers is a horror movie that is taken from the old-school horror formula. The main characters are Darry, who is at least 18, and his older sister Trish, who i guess is about 20 or 21 years old. while coming home from school, they run into the creeper who is thought to be human, but turns out not be. terror and chaos ensues. The ending says ""we're going to make a sequel"" all over it!"
2,"Ummm, Okay?!",I had to watch the second one to fully understand the whole concept of this creature. My advice - just watch Jeepers Creepers 2. It is much better!
2,So much wasted potential......,"The first, say, 90% of this movie was a chilling return to form for the horror genre, focusing on character development, and straying from the Scream formula as much as possible.So you've got a truly scary monster, very talented actors, and some great scenes. So why the two star rating? Plot. I found myself watching this movie, waiting to find out what this thing is, where it came from, and how it came to live in some hole in the ground in the middle of nowhere. The movie never cares to explain any of those things!These plot problems really shot my enjoyment of this movie. The worst part is the potential displayed in the first part of the movie, is completely shattered in under two minutes."
3,God I hope they make a sequel!!,"That guy put the ""BOOGIE"" back in ""BOOGIEMAN""! I could'nt sleep for a week!"
5,true art,at first i saw this as one of the worst movies ever made. never in my entire life was i this scared. well iwatched it with the alternate ending instead of the insanely stupid ending and this gets both my thumbs up. trish and derry are driving on a desolate country road. they havent seen a car for 50 miles and then out of nowhere this truck with a liscense plate that says beatingu shows up and guess whos driving. if you guessed the creeper your right. they see him throw what looks like a body down a sewer pipe. derry goes down to check it out and guess what the creeper seems to be a body collector. this starts off the creepie stuff.just rent it leave your brain on maximum and watch it. you will love it just like i did.
2,Jeepers Creepers......,"I finally saw Jeepers Creepers today, and it was pretty bad. It was really good until the Darry kid went into the basement of the church and they showed close ups of the bodies. They were really fake and basically looked plastic. But the first 45 minutes of the movie was really good. But then it got kind of stupid and then continued down that road until it finally ended. Most movies end with some feeling of closure, but I would say that this was the worst ending of a scary movie that I have ever seen. I wouldn't recommend this movie, unless you don't want to be scared and just want a semi-suspenseful movie."
3,DEFINITELY A RENTAL,"IF YOUR PUBLIC LIBRARY HAS IT, EVEN BETTER. NOT THE BEST HORROR FLICK EVER, OR THE WORST EITHER. SOME INTERESTING CONCEPTS IN THE PLOT, BUT THE MOVIE JUST KIND OF ENDED. WATCH FOR THE SEQUEL."
2,Buy If Cheap,"Although I would rate Jeepers Creepers as an excellent horror flick, I was very disappointed in its video quality on Blu-ray. There are a few scenes where the blu treatment shines; but alas, they are few and far between. Audio is very good, however. If you have the DVD version and a decent up-converting player, I suggest you skip this one unless you can find it at a basement bargain price."
5,"""Scary As Hell""","""Jeepers Creepers"" is about two teenagers who come in contact with an evil enitity known as The Creeper. This creature goes on a killing rampage inflicting terror on those who come in contact with him. ""Jeepers Creepers"" went on to be a huge boxoffice smash making nearly $60,000,000 and spawning a sequel called ""Jeppers Creepers 2"" that was just as good as the original. Producers have stated that a Part 3 and Part 4 will be made in the very near future with Victor Salva coming aboard again as the writer and director. This 2 disc DVD set features a slew of bonuses including deleted and extended scenes, an alternate opening, director's audio commentary, a featurette called ""A Collection Of Mini-Featurettes on the Making of The Film"", original trailer, and more. This is a great way to celebrate Halloween! Turn down the lights and get the popcorn...you will be scared out of your wits!"
5,Get Creeped out with Jeepers Creepers,"I really enjoyed this movie because if you love horror movies, this one doesn't disappoint. Its the classic tale of driving home, taking a shortcut, and ending up getting into an altercation with a strange unknown vehichle...you will see horrors you could never imagine in this movie! So if you are a horror fan, I recommend adding this dvd to your collection~"
1,Ugh.,"Perhaps the only movie I've seen that deserves negative stars. Absolutely the most boring, banal, worthless, unscary drivel I've ever seen. The plot is absurd, the villain is ridiculous, and the acting is the most horrific aspect of the entire movie. The basic plot is that a brother and sister are driving in some backwater (of course) when they hit something (paging I Know What You Did Last Whatever...) and they stumble across some really ugly monster who feeds off people. Can they save themselves in time? Brr. Scary. <yawn>Do yourself a favor and stay away. Far, far away."
1,hmmm.....,"That is the worst - least scary - film I have ever seen. Promising first 15 minutes followed by the least intelligent, pointless collection of disjointed scenes, lame acting and general nonsense I have ever come across. Where was the tension, fear, scares? None...."
1,Trash,"I continue to be amazed how many disgusting ways in which the movie industry can find to kill or mutilate and all of the creatures that they can find to do it in the name of entertainment. This one is right up there with Last House on the Left. That was the last movie I saw where I wanted to walk out. I made myself sit there but this time, I walked out after 25 minutes. I walked out hearing people laugh as a creature was doing something totally disgusting. I wonder about our future!"
1,"Wow, worst movie I've ever seen.",This movie was the singularly worst movie experience I've ever had in my life. The plot and acting were retarded
2,not that great...,"Jeepers creepers is basically a ripoff of many other horror movies from the 70's-80's era, mainly stealing ideas from the texas chainsaw massacre.The movie did have some good gore and makeup, along with a few good scenes, but the main problem with this movie is that it's nothing we haven't seen before. Also, the movie can become slow and boring at times. If you want to see a much better horror movie in the same vein as jeepers creepers, check out wrong turn instead.Rated R for Strong violence/gore, Language, and brief nudity"
1,I am so upset...,"...that I just spent 1 1/2 hours watching this horrible movie. I heard many good things about it, and was very excited to see it myself, and then I actually saw it, and... I can't believe how BAD it was. I don't even begin to comprehend what people saw it in. The script was just INANE, it just did not make any sense at all- some of their ridiculous actions led one to question whether the characters were on drugs or something. There were plotholes (as can be expected from any horror movie), but they were just so glaring that they were unforgivable. There was one suspenseful scene in the whole movie- the one with the cats. I would not recommend this trash even for a late-night party. It was HORRIBLE- do not see. (And I do not give things one star lightly)"
1,Oh my Sweet Gawd!,"Im always up for a new scary movie. Now I just need someone to tell me why I wasted my time watching this one. It would have been a great movie had one understood what was going on for the first 98% on the movie. Even when it ended, I had to sit there and think to understand it. I have NEVER had to do that before. Creepers did have its scary ""monster"" and it did have a huge body count and it did make me bounce in my seat a few times. If thats what you are looking for, go for it. If you like something that makes you think then have your thoughts proven before the last 5 minutes of the movie..this isnt the one for you."
1,For Pete's Sake......,"Tsk, tsk, tsk. What a waste. This movie was a joke. What really gets me is the ending; I couldn't believe it just ended like that. Now that's a sign of a bad movie. Oh, I hope they don't make a sequel......"
4,LOVED IT!,"I like watching movies with gargoyle/demon-like characters so I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! It had pretty good ""special effects"" and left my heart beating fast during some real scary moments. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is into 'fantasy' films--I think you will agree the movie is ""HORRIFFIC"" fun!! =:->="
2,Ran out of gas,"I agree with a previous reviewer. This movie started out great but just fizzled in the end. Actually, it ran out of gas about the same time that Darry and Trish's car ran out of gas less than halfway through he film. That is where we get the diner scene that is a ripoff of Duel, and the introduction of the psychic character who dragged the story down. Shortly thereafter we get a glimpse of the sci fi (not horror) looking beast and we're ready for the credits to roll to save us from wasting any more time."
2,Almost made it,I must admit the first hour of this movie scared me to death. After that it seems as though the writers and producers became uninterested and just wanted to get it over with. It became too Sci-Fi channel and not enough good old horror. A horror movie should stay true and not switch gears which this movie did absolutely terribly. It's almost as if they had 2 separate ideas for 2 separate movies but only enough money for one.
3,Full of Suspense,"The trailers for this movie made it seem so scary, but trailers are usually misleading. Although it did have its scary and whiteknuckle scenes, overall it wasn't a great movie. Siblings Darryl (Justin Long) and Trish (Gina Phillips) are on their way home from their freshmen year at college. Their trip home begins to turn dangerous when they see a man in a trench coat and a hat that covers his face dumping something down a pipe. They recognize him as the man who tried to run them off the road earlier. Like going into a basement in a horror movie, Darryl decides to see for himself what was dumped down the pipe.Soon they realize they're being chased by an ancient demon known as the Creeper."
1,The Dumbest Story ever told.,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. From the completelack of explination as to what the hell that creature is.To the stupidity of the main characters. Gee, I'm drivingdown the road and I see some creepy old guy throw bodies inthe well. Hmmn....Time for Sherlock Holmes here to investigate.Let me go down to the well where it looks like a madman is throwing body bags. Some how I must be more invincible than themortals he slayed previosuly. Now I am being chased by a creature. Let me keep asking this woman who knows just as little as the audience about this creature or what is going on.Stupid! dumb! boring! what the! is this for real!who is this made for! the stoned.and some how they made a sequal.............................This movie should be used as a form of torture.It is the worst piece of American Cinema Ever."
1,No Words can explain how bad this movie is!,"If I could have given it 0 stars I would have! This movie was absolutely terrible from beginning to end. First of all, even a crazy erson wouldn't do half of the things that the two main characters did. If you just saw someone throwin 2 bodies down a huge pipe why would you turn back around to go see if they're alive. Second, if you saw a head without a body attached hit your car window why would you get out the car to see who, what, where, and why!? This movie was poorly written, directed, produced, and the lighting was terrible. There too many parts of the movie where you could see absolutely nothing. This movie gave me a headache and I'm so glad I didn't waste $... to see it in a movie theater(I rented it). I would have been pissed. I f you have never seen this movie please don't waste your time watching it, even when it comes out on cable or even regular TV."
4,3.5 maybe...,"Actually not a bad teen-oriented scary movie. Not too self-referential or inside-jokey, and creepy without too much explicit gore. A lot of the scariness just plays off of our innate dreads and loathings; our attention is also held fast by endless examples of ill-advised ""stupid"" behavior and various plot holes. A pleasantly unresolved, but rather decisive ending. Bring on the sequel!"
3,Scary??? Wouldn't stake a friday night on it,"Good looking but strictly average modern day monster film about two nave teens who are on the run from a gargoyle-like creature who needs to eat human body parts to regenerate tissue. Premise is smarter than the usual genre fodder, but an ultimately weak cast and sporadic direction stop this from becoming anything worthwhile. Director Salva obviously had ambition with this horror movie, which is just as uneven as his more adult film POWDER."
3,Above average Lovecraftian horror yarn,"Arguably, the best thriller since 'Halloween'. Direction is often inspired - a torch illuminating something for the audience that the protaganist cannot see, the out of focus approach of lights unnoticed by another. Other times crass, such as the discovery of the rifled laundry at the diner. The stop-start nature of the action coupled with a plot revolving around a foregone conclusion prevents a head of steam from truly building, but yields other quirky rewards especially in the mordant humour. The background of the director gives this occasionally terrifying film a nasty edge that makes me feel guilty for liking it.The original ending is included as an extra, and is to my mind subtler and more terrifying than the more explicit ending we eventually arrived at. Perhaps, rather patronisingly, they didn't think the audience would 'get it'."
3,First half is Creepers while the second half is Jeepers,"The first half of this movie is excellent with suspense and a even a scene where they make fun of old horror movies. The introduction of the truck and the evil ""thing"" driving it was right on target.The problem is the 2nd half where we see what the evil character really is and the history behind it. It just gets a little fake toward the end and seems to stretch and contort an otherwise good movie. I recommend you see this movie as it does have some aspects of what a good horror movie should be."
3,decent horror film,The first 35 minutes or so of this film is very good and does a great job at building suspense. Then when we find out what the creature is in the black coat it loses all suspenseness. I'd rather the creature have gone unseen and unexplained than a gargoyle looking thing that eats tongues. Decent horror though..I recommend it for a late night rent
2,I Should've Been Warned,"I was really anticipating seeing this movie. However the show had practically no plot. There is a demon out killing people. The cops never get into his cellar and explore anything there where he ate people. They never tell why the demon is after the main character. I mean he wants the main character because otherwise there wouldn't be a movie at all but in the story they said the main character, Darry (Justin Long) had something the demon needed. Everytime I thought the movie was just about to get good, I was let down again. People show up in this movie for a short period of time that seem to know everything about this demon but the movie never explains their connection and how they know the stuff they know. Basically, if the story would have been more solid, the movie wasn't acted out bad, and it just might have been a pretty good flick."
1,doesn't even deserve 1 star,"This is the worst horror movie ever written..Victor Salva, find a new job!I could rehash what the other reviewers said that hated this, but I will digress.This is the stupidest movie in the creation of film. Don't waste your time like I did. The only person more stupid than the two main characters was me, for watching the entirity of it.At least I got my money back from the video store as the dvd didn't work right.TAKE NOTE: don't bother with this movie!!"
1,?????????????????,"I just don't understand! If you like movies that have awful acting, awful plots, and are simply unrealistic, this movie is for you! I like horror movies, but this one is bad. It's by far the worst ""horror"" movie ever, and believe me, I've seen them all! I mean, come on! What were they THINKING? oh.. they WEREN'T thinking...ANYWAY, please, I'm begging you, do NOT waster your time and hard worked for dollars on this amazingly bad ""movie"". I mean, jeez, this is even worse than Urban Legends:Final Cut! And THAT's pretty bad.I guess the most atrocious thing in this movie is the simply horrible acting.OH MY GOD. I have never seen worse acting. Especially in that car scene at the beginning. But I guess if you like watching bad movies, you'll enjoy this. Actually, maybe not. I like cheesy teen horror movies, but this was just TOO bad. It wasn't even a FUNNY kind of bad, like I Still Know What You Did Last Summer or Urban Legend. It was, in four words: AN EMBARRASSMENT TO MANKIND."
3,Jeepers Creepers,"A scary, good horror movie extremly better than Valentine or Soul Survivers. Starring Gina Philips, Justin Long, Eileen Brennan and Jonathon Breck."
1,"Horrible, boring, not scary at all.","Well, the title of my review pretty much sums up how I feel about this movie. Of course, horror movies these days aren't meant to be scary anyways, so that was no surprise. But I'm quite disappointed in the fact that I really wanted to like this movie! I saw the previews for it and it looked good, so we rented it as soon as it came out. It's lucky that I had a crossword puzzle that needed to be finished, because otherwise I would have fallen asleep. I don't recommend this movie by any stretch of the imagination. If you want a good creepy movie, get The Ring. That one was good. This is NOT good. Not good at all. I'm still baffled as to why they bothered with a sequel, I certainly won't waste my money on it, and I can only hope that this doesn't turn into a franchise a'la Jason. Everything about this movie sucked. The story, the acting, and the monster looked completely gay. Skip this movie. Do yourself a favor and watch some good movies tonight."
1,Does this one just suck or just bite?,"It not very often you try and watch a movie that is so lame and stupid, that you tell yourself,it can't any more stupid or asinine.and sure enough, it does.As far as I can tell,the demographic target audience seems to be aimed at tweeners that manage to sneak in from another theater in a megaplex,so that they can brag to their friends they saw an R rated movie.Unless you have an IQ of under 50 or are into sniffing paint fumes,this is not a movie that you want to waste you time on.The only other movie that I have seen that was worse ,was Prophecy: The Monster Movie (1979 release).Please do not confuse it with the Christopher Walken movie of nearly the same name,which is a decent watch."
3,jeepers creepers,"this has all the ingreients of a low budget horror film.there are dumb kids,a mysterious monster that wont die,hick cops,unanswered questions,rednecks who stare when hysterical girls scream in terror,old crazy chicks with cats,a seer........you get the idea.low budget =not enough cash to hire a real star.this film will scar youre kids for life.dont let them watch it!they made a really crappy sequel,but this ones good.most people will like it once.if you like the type of movie,its good again and again.there are a few nasty parts but they are quick not to terribly awful.the chicks are all toothless and clueless rednecks and none of them get naked.it is better than the reviews and you should see it.since part 2 sucks so bad i hope a 3 never-AND I MEAN EVER-surfaces."
1,Jeepers Creepers ...,"If I could rate this movie at less than one star, I would. This movie is .... There is no plot, and it is not scary. All in all, I would rate it about as low as a movie can go."
2,ughh....it's gotta be scary.....oh crap there's the credits,"AAAARRRRGGHHH! What the? This movie really was not worth sacrificing a nap for. All I can say is that the actors can't save a movie when it's flying off a cliff. The actors were superb for not big name people. My plight is not with them...it's with whoever decided to help produce this flaming bag of dog ..... ""Hey there's a body rapped in sheets and ropes that's really bloody...and they just got thrown down a well. I wonder if they're alive....we gotta go back!"" No you don't. So many stupid moments! People just keep doing dumb stuff through the whole movie.....I wasn't even vaguely scared of this movie...and whoever was should step outta there sterile lives cause there clearly panicked by anything that moves (bug, lava lamps, flowing water. This was a really lame movie...at least the acting wasn't horrible."
1,Don't waste your money.,"This movie was entertaining for the first few minutes. It immediately turns into the same sad routine and they put this old song in the movie that has no significance at all. They never established any motive except this big scary guy driving the ultimate redneck mobile from hell has to feed. There was no explanation of where he came from and why he likes that [...] song. Don't waste your money, the only thing I found scary about this movie was the fact that it seemed to be set up for a seq"
1,Tragic,"What a freakin' let down. The first half of Jeepers Creepers is stylish and smart, despite the indulgent self-referencing ""this is the part in scary movies when..."" Once the ""monster"" or whatever it is enters the picture as such, though, all terror vanishes as the makers of this film seem to have hit a wall with the story. Granted, the gruesome end is disturbing, but that is partially because it is so arbitrary. As the credits began to roll my friend and I looked at each other as if to say ""What?"" We weren't alone. The audience booed loudly, and as we exited the theatre the guy in front of us looked blankly at his friend and simply said, ""That (...)."" That pretty much sums it up."
1,horror or comedy?,"i expected a horror movie and i got a pretty good laugh from how dumb it was. from the horrible acting and facial expressions by the actors to the ""jeepers creepers"" song i couldn't seem to make myself jump or freak out, but i was crying from laughter. what's up with this clive barker figure saying it's the scariest movie what was he doing while he was watching. i give this minus 5 stars so stay away from the movie unless you feel like getting a cheap laugh...oh wait i paid 4 bucks to rent the thing you know just forget it"
3,Weird looking ending,What's wrong with the director of this flick? The most unnatural akward way to finalize a film. The whole plot otherwise kept me on the edge.
2,An ending,"Worthy of a better movie. In truth, it is the ending that salvages anything from this rather juvenile, campy piece. The ending is daring and perfect, hinted at by the DVD cover. Not worth watching more than once, and even once is barely worth it. This movie is not for the queasy, but it is in no way scary. It's cheesy."
2,2 Stars for the first Hour!,"Not only should you see this feel if you need a good ""fright"" but if you need a good LAUGH! If not for the first hour of the flick I would pass this movie a no star-er! Grant it, the beggining was interesting..then, boom! By the middle it starts to loose it's impact giving it a Matrix meets Scary Movie type of feel. I'm not even going to go there with the ending..the only thing I must warn you about this film is to save your money and stay away from the sequel!"
2,Very disappointing,"This movie had an incredible amount of potential and the first half makes for one of the scariest movies of the past ten years, brilliantly executed, incredibly creepy - then we get to see the monster and he looks like the dude out of Leprechaun, only taller! Why did we even need to see him in close up at all?!? The scene where he's on the roof of the cop car in the distance framed in the rear window of the kids car was inspired! Then we got to see him in close up and the thrill was gone. DeSalvo has also pinched plenty of set pieces from other movies. There are allusions to Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Birds, Duel, Terminator and the final scene is striaght out of The Silence of the Lambs. This film was incredibly disappointing simply because the first half was so damn good then it copped out."
3,"Has no real plot line, but very disgusting","Throughout the movie, you follow a brother and sister who are being chased by this creature. This creature is attacking everyone it wants, and these two sit there and watch, and when they want to escape, they escape by a hair.The movie did have the disgusting scenes that are still in my mind, which make it difficult for me to sleep at night. It needs a better plot line, but the scare/disgusting factor is good."
3,"great introduction, but then it just kind of ended","this film had a great intro, a lot better than most of those final destination type movies with all the pretty faces, kind of like dawson's creek. now, i know i'm very damn good looking, but not everyone is, especially in america, where most of the population is overweight. all the women in these films are very attractive and even the men are very attractive (hell some of them are prettier than the women.great intro that was influenced by classics such as texas chainsaw and duel, but it seemed to have no middle. it jumped into the action with the mysterious person being a demon from another world, eating people for certain parts of their anatomy, i.e. tongue, eyes, libia, etc. and the end was just cheesy with the demon in his little basement sewing bodies while you see the college boy's face with his eyes cut out, so the demon wins in the end."
3,Jeepers Creepers,"It is rubbish, it isn't scary and has no story line. If you want to watch it. Dont waste your money watching it at the movies. Wait till it comes on tv!!!"
3,Scary movie,"I give this movie three stars. It's very scary and the suspense is good, but the plot could use some build up. If money's tight, I'd do the matinee and save your money. The ending was good, but the movie is too short. I left the theater feeling unsatisfied. I'm not going to tell you the movie, the other reviews do that. Needless to say I'd like a ""Jeepers Creepers II"" so I could understand the plot. There's a lot stuff that I'd like to see explained."
4,"""Excellent movie, horrible ending...""","This was definately the freakiest movie I've ever seen, but the ending is so horrible that...I dunno! The basic plot is Trish (Gina Philips) and her brother, Darry (Justin Long) are driving home from college when their car almost gets plowed by a huge truck (but not a cemi). They calm down and go on their way after the whole thing, and then they drive by a church where they see the occupant of the same truck throwing bodies down a pipe that leads underground. They soon go back to investigate after being run off the road AGAIN and because of their stupid move, they are now being trailed by a winged, muscular, supernatural flesh-eating demon, the Creeper (Jonathan Breck). A really scary movie, buy it on DVD."
4,Excellent Dvd,"I thought the movie was great fun, with its two opposite story directions, ala From Dusk Till Dawn. I had the opportunity to meet the main cast during the Fangoria 2001 Convention so it was great to see them in the movie. Alot of the horror films coming out these days are a disgrace, but this one seems to want to hark back to an earlier time in horror (1970's), but the look of it is what comes through. The dialogue is geared to a more modern approach, but the sarcastic wit is kept to a minimum. The dvd has a great behind the scenes documentary, trailers and deleted scenes. Worth the price."
4,JEEPERS CREEPERS KILLS,"Jeepers Creepers was the scariest movie i have seen since friday 13th. The monster could be better, but the movie still scared the sh!t out of me with its goory scenes and groosome ending. This movie will make you [wet] your pants. I recomend this movie to anyone who is in desperate need of nightmares.this movie is way scarier than 13 ghosts and joy ride."
3,Worth watching,"I'll start by saying this is definetly not one of the best movies by a long shot, but it is still worth seeing at least once. Most people I know either love Jeepers Creepers, or hate it with a passion, but I'm kind of in the middle. The villain is one of the best I've seen in a movie in a long time, and is very entertaining. This movie, unlike most horror movies these days, is actually pretty scary and will give you that creepy feel that everybody loves. I recommend renting it before you buy it, but it is overall a pretty good movie."
2,BEATNGU!!! WEIRD!!!!,"I won't go into the details of this film, as the other reviews did that for you. I'll just give you a quick opinion of this movie... it's was weird as H-E-double-hockey-sticks, and freaky!The acting was excellent... unusual for a horror movie. This is a teen flick, but anyone that likes horror movies will like this one. Tons of totally gross parts throughout this movie will keep you freaked and grossed out!Sure this is full of holes and totally unbelievable... but a strange film that hasn't been done before.... but then, who could think this stuff up!! Like others that reviewed this film, I hated the ending."
3,"Strike one, strike two...","It's a nineties horror movie, strike one.It's called Jeepers Creepers, strike two.Surprisingly, the the actual movie only fouls on the third pitch, and makes it worth spending a couple of bucks.I was pleasantly surprised by the first half of the film, in which we get glances and hints of a scarecrow-like murderous monster with a highly tricked out truck. There are great thrills and scares through about half the movie and then it descends into Jurassic Park 3 type suspense and action. The monster is scarier when you don't see him. The acting is right on, not only with the protagnosits, but as well by Patricia Belcher as psychic Jezelle and Eileen Brennan as the Cat Lady. If you're looking for some contemporary horror that escapes a lot of the cliches of 90s slasher flicks, check this out."
2,"Truly disappointed- I mean, c'mon","Now, I decided to buy yhis movie because it seemed decent, and supposedly it was supposed to be a good horror flick. Though somewhat slow in the beginning, the movie had great potential. I will have to emphasize potential. So you have brother and sister driving home from college. Ok, fine. They are chased by this spooky truck. Still ok. They see the truck and a creepy guy outside the church, tossing something in a culver pipe. Hmm, interesting. They obviously go back to explore (wouldn't you?) Ok, after that scene is where my interest in the movie deteriorated. Another twenty minutes, and I was wishing the kids would get killed, because i disliked the characters that much. If you want in a movie: no background, no character development, hoakie bad guy (when you finally saw him up close- not a good idea,) no resolution, and a whole lot of one sided marginal characters, by all means watch this movie."
2,defective dvd,ok rented it twice on dvd and bought once had return for another copy and all fours times the movie would not play on my dvd play and i tried several other movies and they all worked fine.so inder for me to watch this movie i had to rent a vhs copy.i was wondering did any else who bought this have it not play on thier dvd player
2,"Good film, but don't get attached","I was excited to sit down, and finally have the time to see a movie. I love horror films, so this one I thought would be a good one. Through out the whole movie, I was entertained. Good acting, and good suspense, I was sitting on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next. I was really impressed with the movie until a couple minutes before the film was going to end, I realized the story was not being wrapped up. I was astonished to find out that the movie left us with no good ending at all -- evil prevails over good. So I give this 2 stars...I have to give it some credit for everything besides the ending."
3,DVD problems,Please rent this DVD before you purchase it. I've seen too many problems with DVD players not reading the software. While I was at my local Hollywood Video returning my rental there were two other customers doing the same.
2,Mixed feelings,"I had a hard time trying to decide wether to give this movie two or three stars. In the end I decided 2 but I could see if someone wanted to give 3.The good:1) First half of the movie.2) The creature before you actually see him.3) The truck he drives.4) The old school horror movie feel they try to give.5) The attractive sister.The bad:1) The second half the movie.2) The creature after you see fully see it.3) The physic.4) The stupid song.5) the fairly weak story.In short if they would have kept the creature a mystery a bite longer, took the physic out, and came up with a slightly better premise for the creature this movie would have been great. As it is, it's still fun, not great but fun. If you like horror movies and do not require it to have a deep plot or to wow you. This movie will entertain."
4,The Best in Awhile,"I almost consider this movie to be a slasher movie, it's not until the last quarter of the movie that you realize we dealing with a supernatural type of monster. The first half of this movie gets nerves rattled enough to coast through the rest of the movie. There have been a lot of, so called, horror movies out lately but this one wasn't to cheesy and kept you on the edge of your seat. I personally liked this movie because it almost scared me, and that is very rare with the movies that are spewed out now days."
4,Something refreshing for the horror genre!,"I'm a big fan of the horror movie genre and this movie is definitely one of the best and underrated. I liked the fact that the movie went with a family angle (brother/sister) rather than another overused ""romantic couple getaway that turned deadly"" kind of film. Another aspect of the film that works is the dialogue. I can't remember their names, but the brother/sister duo had great chemistry together. The movie lives up to its title and I did find it creepy. Another refreshing factor in the movie is the ending. Many horror movies have a certain formula but this one went against your typical hollywood ending. Overall, if you like being scared, this'll do it to you. I didn't give the film 5 stars though because I feel like it ended too quickly and didn't cover enough ground. Hopefully a sequel is in the works and will be a continuation."
2,"Dreadful, predictable and pathetic","Actually, make that 1 and half stars.Two of my friends one day asked me - ""Why don't you watch many modern horror movies?"" I explained to them that I usually found them boring, predictable and a waste of time, but I was reluctantly persuaded to see it after my friends claimed that it was supposed to be 'The greatest horror movie of the last ten years'. ( Whoever made that claim seriously needs their head checked ).It starts off very well, but after the scene in which we see the man put two bodies down a large pipe, it goes drastically downhill. The main pitfall of this movie, as in most horror movies, is that there are also too many unrealistic moments - namely who would be stupid enough to climb down the large pipe?The story seems to get more and more ridiculous as the film goes on, and by the end of it I had really lost my patience.If this is the best horror movie of the last ten years, then God help us."
1,100%Crap,This movie was horrible please don't buy this movie it is so retarted please don't waist your time watching this movie. I really wish I could give this 0 stars.
4,interesting and worth a look,"Iam not in the young school, I was brought up on ""Hammer"" horror movies, in the era of ""Dracula"" and Christopher Lee.I saw this movie being advertised on TV,it looked interesting, so I took a chance and went to see it,I had pre-conceived notions on what might lie ahead, having seen so much rubbish that is served up in the name of horror.I found this movie very well executed with very scary moments, you dont need buckets of gore to make a good horror movie, and thank goodness this didn't occur. Victa Salva has produced a very good scary movie, it's Characters are beleivable. Well the truck driving demon is terrific!! I guess there are moments during the film that sure shock you, it.s all like a surrealistic nightmare.moments of ""Dual"" and ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" come to mind, this is all of them, well done to all, a refreshing change from the usual rubbish that fills our movie screens. Go see it Or Rent it."
4,"A fine, fine horror film. (*spoilers*)","These people that complain about the downbeat ending seem to be missing the point. Folks, folks, folks, IT'S A HORROR MOVIE. See, no happy bubblegum endings. No pop-stars coming out to sing you to sleep. No ""yaayyy, we won and the bad guy is toast!"" Perhaps you'd be better off with Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer or any other of those washed-out, watered-down teenie-bopper MTV slasher BORES, because, obviously, the good guys win. While you're at it, avoid Night of the Living Dead -- you probably won't like the ending to that much either. ""Eewww, the ZOMBIES WIN? Aw, man, that makes me sad! And what's with all that black and white? They had color in the sixties, didn't they?"" (*shudder*)"
1,1 star because I couldn't give it a zero.,"This is the most useless excuse for a scary movie I have ever seen. It's poorly written and the production quality is terrible. There is not one scare in the whole hapless mess, but there are several ""gross"" for the sake of gross scenes. Don't even bother renting this one. And certainly don't buy it."
1,one step up from AI,"this is by far the worst movie all year (besides AI, but that was so bad that it doesn't even register). i can't understand why everyone is giving it rave reviews. ... ... this movie has no plot and doesn't bother explaining anything about the not-so-scary monster, other than that every 23 years it has to...""eat"" (oooh, ominous). i guess no one noticed a couple dozen people disappearing in this town 23 years ago. i found myself laughing far too often, at the plot (or lack thereof) and also the special effects. they bring to mind a bad episode of ""buffy the vampire slayer."" the acting is alright, especially for unknowns...some of the brother/sister banter in the beginning was amusing, but only for so long. other than the brother, sister and monster, the other characters seem forced, as if they just happened to stumble on set. we know nothing about them, other than that they're eccentric. ooh. and the end of the movie was awful, but at least it was short."
1,Creepers?,"I went to see this film after I heard it was the best horror movie in years. I was sorely disappointed. The idea for the story isn't bad. And I thought the acting was fine also. But it's one horror cliche' after another. And I didn't think it was suspenseful or scary. But if that is what you're wanting to see then it's the movie for you. But if you're expecting it to be the Halloween, Friday The 13th or Nightmare on Elm St of this era then you're gonna be disappointed. IMO..........."
5,A great thriller!,"Jeepers Creepers is a wonderful movie! With an original plot, and the suspence mode that it will have you in from beginning to end is an awesome rush! I say buy it. Everybody that I know loves this movie, and hopefully you'll like it also! It's a great installment to anyone's collection."
4,Better than the sequel,The First JC was more about the suspense and the unknowns related to the trama. The second one was more about the gore. Its a shame Gina didn't appeared in the second one. But I would recommend this one to anyone.
2,weak,"high expectation when i put the dvd to watch it.... in the end, disappointed. an average movie, very predictable, we don't know who the creeper is and where does he come from.. there are better movies in the categorie. watch it in the tv..."
2,Lawrance is right,"The beginning is great; it gets you thinking, ""Wow, maybe this will be a REAL horror film for a change."" Then the whole thing falls apart pretty fast. The director wants to scare you, but isn't sure exactly how he wants to do it, so you end up with a film and a creature (who likes 20s tunes, apparently) that's all over the place, but that really goes nowhere. Some OK special effects. Get it cheap or rent it."
1,Sure it's original...but that's about it.,I didn't like this movie very much. The way it ended was too weird for me. So I didn't understand it. And there were many plot holes. Things were left unexplained.I honestly don't know why it was a success....
2,A Big let down,"Watching the beginning of this movie showed much promise in a complete and well made horror movie that was long over due. Boy, was I wrong. By the end of the movie I felt disapointed and disguised about a movie that didn't even come close to bringing the horror genre back from the gutters. A poor excuse for a horror film."
3,Jeeper Sleepers!!!!!!,"Typical movie where morons can't mind there business, they just had to be nosy! There was a few minutes of scare, but I was too busy laughing, or nodding off! If you like the type of movie, where 2 teenagers are being chased all around back roads, by a psycho who never is going to die.....then you should like this movie. But I still say they should of added more to this movie, at least in Halloween we knew the killer was psycho kid!"
4,THE CREEPER,This was a very cool movie...it was something new for the horror movies...Gina Philips was great..and looks great to...it will give you the creeps in certain places and the creepers truck is something new...The Creeper is a great addition the horror movies...Not knowing anything about the creeper makes it that much more interesting...the dvd is great...all the features in it...how it was made and all...this is a very creepy movie to watch in the dark...it is worth 4 stars...the creeper rules...
3,Looks like tense horror flick until falling apart at end,"Much of the way through this, I thought I was seeing one of my new favorite horror films. It was edge-of-your-seat excitement. I thought They hadn't made much of anything like this in years, and I was reminded of good old days of suspenseful horror. Too bad the ending was a real let down. In fact, I scarcely remember how it came out. Maybe it's best to watch and enjoy the main body of the film and then dream up your own ending. If you're at all imaginative, you'll come up with an improvement."
4,Jeepers Creepers...where'd you get those Peepers!!,"I am a huge horror fan and have been waiting for a movie that will scare me and make me jump...and this was it!! I'd seen trailers of the movie and I knew that evil man would scare me. I've never spent 30 minutes of any film jumping out of my skin every 5 seconds, it was great!! The use of shock tactics was excellent and the man who preys on these 2 teens is terrifying...up until one point. The illusion of a scary old guy was shattered when he suddenly has wings and a scaly body. I think this killed the terror. The use of effects made the guy less scary. But all things considered this movie was non stop thrills from beginning to end. Finally a horror movie with a different formula, unlike the conventional killer stalks teens + kills teens + dies at the end formula. Well worth a peep!!!"
2,"Jeepers Creepers, a horror? I swore it was a comedy!","This was the most pathetic horror I have ever laid my eyes on. If you thought Nightmare on Elm Street was corny, you'll despise this. The story was so obvious that it was plain sad. I thought the 2 teenagers in the beginning were actually going to go somewhere and do smething productive but no, they just drove around the entire time, running away from this hilarious looking monster. The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars because it was so bad that it was one of the funniest things I've seen since Monty Phython's Holy Grail and Mystery Science Theater (which are awesome shows by the way). I laughed throughout the entire show and so did the majority in the rest of the theatre. So if you're looking for something to amuse you, take a look at this movie, otherwise rent something worth your 5 bucks."
1,Incompatible DVD - BEWARE,"I have a standard Pioneer DVD player and the movie fails to start upon selecting the widescreen or standard format. I then tried the DVD on my brand new Apple Powerbook with its DVD player program - it killed the program. Finally, I tried to play the DVD on my ThinkPad T30 (brand new), and it crashed that player program too. It kinda makes one wanna say ""jeepers creepers!"". The cover art on the DVD case looks cool. For those of you who can play it, I'm jealous."
1,If only there was a zero stars option ...,This movie is one of the *worst* movies I have ever seen. It ranks right up there with Rollerball in terms of horrible scriptwriting. There are so many massive plot holes that it makes my head hurt. My friends and I saw this movie and upon the end of it couldn't stop laughing and then promptly demanded for a refund for our movie tickets.The movie was a good horror flick right up until the last half hour or so. It seems like the writers just sort of winged an ending. The writers must have some sort of anathema against a decent ending ...Rent something else. Even the new Jason In Space (Jason X or whatnot) is a better flick.
1,"Jeepers Creepers, wish I had known who the director was!","A pile of forgettable rubbish that went absolutely nowhere, explained nothing, had a monster that looked like a guy in a rubber suit, and a CONVICTED molester of children for a director, this one is worth ZERO stars. Too bad there's a one star minimum. I wish I had not unwittingly put money into the pocket of this director."
1,Garbage,"theres not to many horror movies that I think really suck ass.but im proud to say this is one horror movie that really stinks.flys wont even land on this garbage!The highlight of the whole god damn movie besides the credits is hmm the creeper eating the cops tung out(but that wasnt even all that cool im jus tryin to find a little light in this crap)the extra features on the dvd is not bad. theres alote of crap about this ledgendary peace of crap on itI wached the ""making of this crap"" on the dvd and it almost made the movie look good (thats untill you wach it)3 hours a my life ill never get backhopfully jeepers creepers 2 will be better :(dont buy this crap but if you got 3 bucks burnin a hole in ya pocket. I guess you could rent it(but imagine all the stuff you could get for 3 bucks besides jc)"
1,MINDLESS DRIVEL,"One star for this film is one star too many , unfortunately the review page won't let you put 0 stars .This film is basically ""The Hitcher"" , ""Dual"" + ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" all rolled into one . On the face of it that might not seem like a bad place to start , unfortunately this film is totally lacking any of the qualities that made those 3 films classics and ends up being so predictable , boring + totally lacking in suspence or imagination that the only good thing about watching this film on video as opposed to at the cinema is that you can fast forward through all the dull bits - of which there are many . I thought films like ""Scream"" were supposed to have put an end to mindless drivel like this . Take my advice and give this film a miss , life's just too short !"
1,If movies made us dumber....,"If movies could make us dumber by simply watching them, this movie would be one of them. I expected a rollicking horror film, but instead got a mediocre effort at best. The first few minutes of the movie were genuinely scary, however, it went downhill after that. The plot was predictable, and the ending was a feeble attempt at black comedy. If i could give this film less than one star, I would."
1,Think you've seen the worst? Not 'til you've seen this!,"I have never in my life seen such an insipid, pointless, and utterly annoying piece of so-called ""horror"" as this poor excuse for a movie! I am big horror fan, always looking for a good horror movie to see, and this piece of film was the worst I've ever found. The scariest thing about this movie was that it brought in a single penny at the box office.Watching the characters do the dumbest possible things scene after scene was annoying, and if I hadn't seen it in a theater with a lot of people making funny comments, I would have walked out. Aside from some grotesque imagery at various points in the movie, there was nothing scary in it. This attempt at horror will leave you not only unamused, but rather annoyed that you wasted an hour and a half or so of your life watching it."
3,Not half bad for the most part,"Victor Salva (Powder) wrote and directed this surprise 2001 horror hit in which two teen siblings (Gina Philips and Justin Long) come across an ancient flesh eating demon who feasts every 23rd spring, and naturally, both of them are next on the menu. What could have been another modern day teeniebopper horror fest manages to be tenion fueled (the opening truck chase nicely sets the tone), but Jeepers Creepers fails to live up to it's full potential. Horror vets will appreciate the heart that Salva and co. had in making the film (which despite it's small budget manages to shine more than some big budget horror films a la the last Halloween movie), but don't expect anything really special from it. Godfather trilogy director Francis Ford Coppola served as a co-executive producer of the film."
4,"Great Movie,[bad] Ending","Dude this movie rocked but the ending [was] really bad. I mean it felt so abrupt u almost forget how good the rest of it is. But as I saw last night at the movies seeing 28 Days Later(great movie with a good ending) they are making a sequel so thats cool. The first half hour as many have said was GREAT and the rest was really cool so definitly see this if u like horror movies and the only bad thing about it is the ending. Hope U Like it,Later"
4,Jeepers Creepers,I think that the movie was really creepie and great. After all it had a lot of hard work put into it.It was an over all great movie that i would want to see again. The only thing that people were dissapointed about was the Ending {witch i won't explain because that would spoil it for other people who havent seen it.}
5,Director's commentary,"I won't write too much about the film itself, other critics have done that for me. In short, being a big fan of horror films, I would say that this movie adds a new dimension to the horror genre, and you should enjoy it if you have enjoyed other films in the same field. One extra comment I would add is that the director's commentary on the DVD is well worth listening in to. I learned so much more about what he was trying to achieve with certain scenes. Unlike many other commentaries, I was happy to listen to this throughout thew entire film."
4,"""Jeepers,creepers, where did you get those peepers?""","This movie was great,to me it was a combination between pure monster horror,relationship between brothers and a thriller.the movie kept my interests till the very end of it, the best thing i liked about the movie was that the makers made the movie in a way that along the movie you get more information and knoledge about the ""creeper"", who is he,what is he etc...*i gave it 4 stars and not 5 because the end was very dipressing and left a bitter and sad thoughts in my hed...DONT LET ANYONE TELL YOU ABOUT THE END OR THE CREEPER!!!!...P.S: some very good special material are included!"
2,Not Impressed,"I would like to know cookieman exactly where you purchased your edition of Jeepers Creepers from. On your say-so, I purchased the edition available here since the one out here in Australia only has a director's commentary and being a big fan of this film, I wanted as much extra material as I could get. Guess what? It's the same edition....Where did you get it?"
3,I STILL HAVE NIGHTMARES ABOUT THE MOVIE!!!,"I am not much of a scary movie fan, but this is one of the better ones I have seen to a point. Some scenes totally grossed me out, while others left me hiding my eyes in front of my face. I think the plot itself is original, but man...the two main characters are total idiots!!! I'm not going to write a long boring summary, but I will say the ending of the movie still gives me chills and leaves me with nightmares. Also, I couldn'r really say that the plot was predictable...but the characters were. In my opinion, if you see something scary or freaky happen in front of you...you don't just stand there...you get the heck out as soon as possible!!!"
1,One of the worst movies ever made!,"I have never seen a more inconsistant, worthless movie as this...it's not even slightly scarry. It's like a little kid wrote it saying ""and then and a'and then this happens and oh yeah then and then this happens..."" Save yourself the time and money,the only scarry thing is how poorly written it is..."
1,Horrible Film...,"I normally love horror movies..good or bad I usually love them all. But this pile of garbage was crap from beginning to end. The first time you heard that song you knew what was coming there were no surprises whatsoever. with an abrupt and rather horrendous and predictable ending the film had little pay off for all its hype. Oh and for more joy why not check out the alternate ending on the DVD. which isn't any better then the original (in fact for those people that don't like the bad guy winning type endings may find it even more depressing. Is that both bro and sis in that scene on the wall?). Try and aviod this film at all Cost, worst Horror film ever made."
1,Early Adopter DVD Machine-Will not play movie,"I can access only the side two special features on my DVD player. However, I have had some success on my computer DVD drive.This movie freezes at the ratings screen after you choose widescreen or pan and scan mode.Anyone else have this problem?"
3,It started off good..............,Wow. Scary as hell. that is how you describe the first say 45 minutes of JC. Then it all falls down...This movie is about some monster that eats you and only comes out for a certain amount of time and a certain number of days. So there are theses two kids brother and sister going to visit mom from college. And while driving down the road they are being chased. Freaking scary... So they freakout and bring the thing into town. So now they are in town and find this werid as place and end up going into this well thing. While down there he finds 1000's of death bodys torn up and sowed back together. Great fun. So now everyone in town is dying and you find out the creature is a bat thing....? ( this is where it falls) And so as smart kids do they go into the police station and are like help! and the monster is there too! OH NO! blah blah nothing is happening.... and the end. thats the movie.... RentJared
3,"""I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER"" MEETS ""DUEL""",well the 1st half hour anyways. the rest of it ? who knows? . but it was pretty fun
3,WHERE'D YOU GET THOSE PEEPERS,"Any movie that has once Oscar nominated Eileen Brennan (Private Benjamin) offering a five minute cameo as a crazy old lady with zillions of cats can't be all bad. And it's not. While it is short on plot, long on stupidity, and poorly lensed, JEEPERS CREEPERS is a scary little movie. Patricia Belcher as the psychic also is so bad she is good, does that make sense? The kids (Gina Phillips & Justin Long) try hard to be brother/sister, but they do some incredibly stupid things and their looks of shock early on are definitely high school thespian at best. However, towards the end, especially in the scenes at the police station, Phillips and Long show signs of being really capable performers. The ending in which Gina offers herself in place of Long is a very unusual anti-formula one, and its resolution quite shocking.I have to say, too, the early sequence in which the truck is harrassing the younguns is pretty effective, too.Not a cinematic gem, but it is a scary one."
2,"Blah, blah,blah","Got this for one of those Barnes and Noble University writing classes. If you must, borrow a copy. Otherwise, the same information and resource are found online."
2,"Good story, bad editing.","This is a good story; don't get me wrong! I hope Dorothy Kliewer will read this because she needs a NEW EDITOR! The editing on this very good story is unacceptable. As I said, the story is good; however, sometimes the language usage is stilted or unnatural for the character. In fact, I got so mixed up on who was who that I had to write down names & look back in the book to see who they were. Sometimes, characters appeared like I should have known who they were or I should have read the previous books! I strongly suggest she contact the editor for Laurie King, Nancy Atherton or John Grisham. At least, their editors know how to put the story together in a better & more readable way."
1,rollers?,"I hadn't bought this brand of rollers in almost 40 years, but didn't think they would have changed. I was very wrong. The much lower quality makes them impossible to use. I threw them away within a week of purchase."
3,okay,"I got these cookie cutters to go with the theme of my baby shower. Well whenever the cookies came out of the oven, them cookies did not look like anything they were supposed to. So basically this was not a successful product to me."
2,Not what appears in the picture,"The picture makes it look like this organizer holds cds and I assumed, other various things you might need in your car like a pocket for pens or something. What I received is a pocket which can hold various random things like a mug holder and ties around the front seat. TOTALLY different from what appears in the picture."
3,Not the same as in picture!,"I purchased this because my car has no cup holder. In the picture, the organizer is divided into 3 compartments, so that a cup would stand up in each. The actual product has no dividers. I have tried to make one so that I can still use it on the passenger seat as a cup holder. It is also a pain to have to detach the strap around the seat to remove it every time I have a passenger in the car, but the main problem is that it does NOT have dividers as shown in the picture -- your cup will fall over unless you stuff the rest of the space around the cup with some filler."
3,not as helpful as I wanted,"I tried this in a 2007 Toyota Corolla.It nicely held hand sanitizer, tape, a pack of pencils, and the kids' sunglasses. But it was so floppy that it was very difficult to keep it organized, and the cardboard-reinforced pockets were so rigid as to be entirely unuseful. Elasticized interior pockets would have been much, much better. If you only wanted a place to store maps, this would be good -- although placed on the floor behind the passenger's legs, it is not too convenient for easy access. It's better to have maps in the door pocket, in my experience."
2,too small,This case was deceivingly small based on the picture. OK for small items but it doesn't want to stand in place and anything top heavy pulls it over. I should have paid more attention to the dimensions in the specifications.
2,"Okay case, but not worth the money","Okay case for my extra cards, although, I was not too excited about how easily the mesh ripped apart when I tried to get one card out. Now I can only carry 3 cards instead of the 4. When I am taking sports photos, I can't be messing with a case that my card can fall out of as I unzip it to get to another card.My back pocket seems to work just as well as long as the cards are in their own little protective cases. I'll just put this case on the strap of my camera case and use it as a change purse and go back to using my pocket.Outside construction is nice, but the way the mesh was sown in isn't that great. I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase this particular product again, and I own quite a bit of Targus items. This one is a disappointment."
3,Pockets are a little tight,"I purchased 2 of these to hold my many CF cards. The biggest problem I've seen is that the pockets are tight. Some of my CF cards a thicker than my other ones, and it takes a bit of effort to get them in the pockets. Other than that, they are very helpful when I'm photographing a wedding, because I can hook them to my belt loop, and feel safe knowing they are on my person at all times."
4,Targus DMC111 Digital Memory Card Case - Black (Koskin),"Excellent product, well made, looks good and so far, very durable...also I am now able to transport extra memory as well as additional flat batteries.I purchased two of them, one for everyday and a back-up for vacation."
3,Flea Market Mystery,"As an avid collector, I was delighted to find a mystery that takes place at flea markets. The book is well-written and the characters are interesting.The inside look at flea market and antique vendors was informative. The heroine is over 60, yet portrayed as a dynamic person with a full life. (Those of us of a certain age are grateful for such depictions.)"
1,Not effective,"I did not find these chlorine tablets effective at all. They left my pool cloudy, and I also found I had to add a ton of tablets to get my levels up. I will not purchase this again."
5,Dry mouth first aid,"I suffer with dry mouth after years of medications which can cause this problem. My dentist gave me a sample of the Tom's of Maine -Lemon Lime Anti-Cavity Dry Mouthwash. The product works well, and I am now using the moutwash after every meal for even better protection from dry mouth."
3,"Too many empty seas, too much slavish adoration by the editor","The journal entries were intermittently interesting but the remarks by the editor were frequently irritating in their slavish adoration of this supposedly great man. The best journal entries were those dealing with the encounters with the various south sea aborigines.One of the best things about this must be its shortness. I see that the Penguin edition of the journals is twice as long. Ouch!The last chapter is completely devoted to a further elaboration, not to say repetition, of Cook's many, many great qualities, which I only gave the most cursory look, i.e., I skipped it.Why the editor felt it was necessary to preserve every one of Cook's many misspellings and grammatical gaffs is beyond me, unless it was because he thought that everything related to Cook was divinely inspired. The journal entries' style is also overwritten and convoluted in that upper-class Victorian style."
3,Great in concept -- fair in reality,"I was very excited to find this item and when I finally got it I have to admit a little disappointment. The clock itself is well made and looks good. However, the automatic time setting is flakey. The first night it set itself 10 minutes slow. After talking to customer service they said to give it a couple days to get the signal again. Last night it didn't receive a signal at all so I had to manually set the clock 10 minutes faster. I live in San Francisco in an apartment with no steel walls so I have no idea why it isn't getting a signal properly.Other minor peeve is that the LCD is exceptionally bright, even on dim setting."
4,A satisfied buyer,"I like very much the clock display and the good tone from the radio. You should install a 9 volt battery so in event of power outage it holds the atomic clock setting, I hadn't put in a battery and upon power outage it took about 2 hours to auto set the time, after I put in battery and after another power failure it reset instantly. So far I am perfectly happy with this item."
4,"Nice features, good WWVB signal reception","This clock radio has nice features - dual alarm, weekend/weekday settings, gradual wake-up alarm. I have other clocks that don't synchronize at a certain part of the house, but this one does. I read somewhere it checks WWV in addition to WWVB. What I don't like is the short antenna cable and that the time drifts by as much as 4-5 seconds as the day progresses before finally synchronizing at night."
3,"Quirky, but I'll keep it...",The LED's are too bright even on the lowest setting. The case looks like it's made from cheap plastic. For the amount of money I'd expect to have a digital tuner and volume control instead of the old style rollers. The clock setting functionality worked great in my area.
1,It Just Doesn't Work,"The reason I gave this clock a ""one"" rating is the dishonesty of selling it with the claim that it will synchronize to the atomic clock in Colorado. It simply doesn't work. I live in Florida and that is apparently too far to receive the atomic clocks signal. I have had it sitting for five days waiting for it to sync up and it never has. IF I keep the clock I'll just have to set it manually and consider it a normal clock radio. But this is not what I expected given the claims. I suppose it works great for people in Colorado, but not for people in the rest of the country."
2,Old technology from Emerson Research.,"I used to have this same unit under the brand name ""Emerson Research"" It's a pretty good unit, but it's a very old model. For the price, you can get a much more modern one from Emerson Research at a local store."
3,Almost a winner,"I like the controls and the layout. The clock is well designed and easy to use, which is unusual for one of these things. It's a solid little unit that picked up the atomic time in less than 5 minutes. So far, so good. The fatal problem is what others have noted: it is WAY too bright even on the dim setting. The thing should be called an atomic clock radio / night light. We compared it to two other alarm clocks and it had to be three times as bright as either of them. It literally lit up half a side of our king bed on the dim setting.I mean, you create a nice design and layout, which seems like the hard part, and then you make an obvious goof on the display. Did anyone put this in a dark room before finalizing this thing for production?"
3,"Great features, poor ergonomics","I loved the dual alarms, the weekend/weekday features and the fact that it kept perfect time, even ""Springing forward"" and ""Falling back.""It had a couple of ergonomic problems. It was easy to inadvertently turn the alarm off when checking to see if it had been set right (oversleeping in Seattle!) Also, it had a green display, while red would have been better. (Red does not destroy night vision, which is why pilots' displays are red.)After half a dozen years of good service, my SCR110 suddenly lost all time, even though it had a new battery backup. When that happened a 2nd time, I replaced it with a different clock radio."
4,"Excellent clock, good radio",When I received it I read the quick set up and plugged it in and within 5 monutes everything was running. The digits on the clock were just the right size that I could see without my glass from accross the room. The radio was not high fidelety but satisfactory.
1,Not what we thought!,"The clock/thermometer do look like the picture, BUT it's decieving as everything is the samecolor so you can't see the hands to tell time or temp. The pics look like the hands really stand out & there is color shading behind the numbers --- not so! It's all the same gray of unglazedceramic & the hands are such a pale gold you can't see them at all unless you stand right in front& up really close. Very disappointed! Certainly not worth it for the price. Will replace as soon as we find something we can see -- $92 plus over $12 for shipping down the tubes."
4,Great..but not enough,"Really liked the pack but wasn't large enough for my needs so had to return. Well constructed and particularly liked the rain cover pull-out. I have a lot of equipment - 2 bodies, 3 lenses (one the Canon 100-400mmL which is BIG), a little point & shoot along with all the other ""stuff"" (batteries, cards, etc). Could just barely get that in and if wanted to add flash, could not do. If you've significantly less equipment - one body a couple of lenses, a hot shoe flash and odds and ends, should work just fine and I'm sure you would be happy."
5,very tough but worth it,"I found this movie difficult, disturbing yet, ultimately, not without hope. Tom Hulce is great as we see his character transform from happy and optimistic complete with his unique loose-lip grin to the grim, sad man he becomes. The scenes of Lolita Davidovich and the little neighbor girl will tug your heart..This movie addresses the human need to believe in something bigger than ourselves and how that need is exploited."
4,The Inner Circle Review,"The Inner Circle is a well-made film with fine performances; it shows a convincing and realistic picture of lives of the ordinary soviet people during Stalin's rule. I watched this movie on my Amazon Kindle Fire HD 9"" with excellent picture and sound."
4,Fine. No problems.,"I'm not exactly an expert on film quality, but I had no problems with this Digital Videocassette. It recorded just fine in my Panasonic camera. Just pay attention to how many you are ordering. I thought for some reason I was ordering a three-pack. But there was only one. My mistake."
5,"Goats to the left, goats to the right....","(Okay, so I'm also a Jimmy Buffett fan.....)I like this calendar, since I breed goats. The pictures are cute, the calendar itself is easy to read and ""clean"" (not a lot of extraneous crap in the boxes), making it good to mark up. It would probably make a great ""barn"" calendar if you could bear to put it out there, to mark down kidding dates and other stuff. (Keep it out of the reach of the goats, though -- they'd probably think it was tasty....I know MINE would......)"
4,Sony boombox,"I have had one for several years, use it on a boat,great on batteries, always works, gets kicked around with no problems, if you can stand the yellow color, it is excellent for outdoor activities"
3,lesser stuff,"After the stunning first three volumes and the complete Silver John stories in the upcoming fifth volume, this book represents the leftovers. By most standards they're great fun and only pale next to the other books. Still, a great collection made possible by the great folks at Night Shade. Also, the absence of the poor illustrations is only a plus."
5,classic post punk,"The Room's first album proper from 1982 is a minimalist masterpiece. Swirling Wem Copycat reverb laid over tumultuous drumscapes. Anxious guitar spikes, looped melodic basslines and existential crooning. The classic single 'Things Have Learnt to Walk That Ought To Crawl' predicts The Smiths sound in its catchy adrenal headrush. 'No Dream' is like a rakish new wave Pink Floyd, stripped of artifice and pretention. Moody and dark but never depressing. If you like Interpol and the current post-punk influenced crop, do yourself a favour and listen to this."
5,"Great Product, Great Price","Fits perfect, works great and at a very good price. Better than OEM! I will purchase again & replace yearly to keep suspension plush!"
1,"Lasted Less than one year,Poor Co service,Not good for the earth","I bought a set of 5 surface mount sunspot lights. They looked great under my cabinets however after about 5 months the bulbs started to burn out. They where very expensive to replace about $5.00 each.Now 8 months later the entire set stopped working. I determined the transformer burned out.The transformer says it has a 5A fuse.There must be one somewhere in the molded plastic goop inside the transformer, but forget it you will not find it. The transformer can not be replaced or purchased seperate.These lights are not made to last.Good Earth Company totally ignored my emails. I am forced to purchase a whole new set. Total Junk!. Old one will be in the landfill."
2,Buy a better set of lights,I have had three of the the 5 puck sets for about 2 years. Everything worked fine until now. The first reviewer did not do poor electrical work. The transformers have all started to fail. I will try to adapt 120v to 11.5 v transformers into the individual systems. We'll see what happens. The life of this product is limited. I hope this review helps.
5,Solid knobs,"I ordered a bunch of these to replace the old doorknobs on a house we just bought. Take my advice: spend the extra money and buy Schlage! These knobs have a very solid feel- they don't feel cheap. Easy to install, push-button lock, great finish. I also bought some non-locking knobs for the laundry room, closets, etc., and some dummy knobs for the double-door entrance closet. The different models of the Plymouth line all match in color and style.Now if there was only a way to order Plymouth entrance deadbolt locks from Amazon that are keyed alike, but that's another story..."
3,* * * A- THUMBERS- WORST- ENEMY * * *,"This is no turkey, 3 stars (out of five). Three stars is based on its hit rate; that is, a ratio of movies physically in video stores vs. those in the Video Guide. At Blockbuster and Hollywood for every five videos physically on the shelf there's three in the book, ergo, three stars. After endless thumbing ONE out of three videos on the shelf gets 4-stars. Design's a problem, an index in front could help reduce the endless page turning. It's a no-go for taking to the video store."
4,Great Overview Of Limahl and Kajagoogoo,"This is a GREAT cd to buy if you want an overview of the group and solo career of Limahl. The tracks include the ""Midnight Mix"" of Too Shy, several 12"" and extended remixes as well as some Limahl solo efforts ( Ireally liked ""Inside to Outside""). From the reviews I have read of some of the later Limahl efforts you are better off with this CD."
2,superficial and lazy job,"Im sorry to say this is a very mediocre book. It's got no heart, ir poorly organized and feels like it was put together in a week. The author interviewed 30-some people and tries to use their experiences to tell a story much too large for the effort he has invested. All the quotes are anonymous, which leads to reader to wonder just how real they are. This is a good idea, poorly executed, one that promises far more than it even attempts to deliver. It's a deceitful book and a real disappointment. Stay away."
2,Would suffice to have merely read the first 50 pages.,"This book did offer insight into the minds of prosecutors and their daily struggles and tribulations. However, it was extremely repetetive and the manner in which the book was assembled was cut and paste over and over with little coherency. I rate it two stars, and that is very generous."
4,"After 8 years of French Struggles, Final Battle of Dien Bien Phu, Indochina War started !","After 8 years of French Struggles,Final Battle of Dien Bien Phu,Viet Nam started !After the WW11,Frech Government ruled Viet Nam again. in 1946, Ho Chi Minh declaredVetnam's Independence.Crucial,deadly 8 years Battle of Vietnam started.From the first Frech trrops had been difficult Battle from sporadic Guerillar Fighting ofHO Chi Minh.even many military supports from US.Missed military decision,fortified point deffense of Dien Bien Phu(with old Japanese Air Strip)for cutting Viet Minh's supply line to Ally Laos.

3,Cheaper at the store,"The product was great, my daughter loved them, but I do know that I paid a little too much. You pay for the convenience of front door delivery I guess. Otherwise I cannot complain."
1,this is'nt leo kottke.,you've made a mistake with this audio sample.this is someone other than leo kottke.(i don't want to know who!).wake up you guys.
2,A little over priced,"I can't detract to heavily from the quality but the price seems rather high for an item that doesn't come as a pair. If all you need is one ramp though and you include the cost of shipping then this was indeed fairly priced. The only problem was that I thought I was buying a pair. My mistake, but I dare say they do seem like a nice ramp but I just wish that I had gotten a pair of them instead of only a single ramp."
2,I was fooled,"Well, I wish I had read the reviews first.. The picture surely shows 2 ramps- And exactly how and why I need 2... However, only one comes with an order.. Perhaps on the verge of false advertisement (?)To make it even worse, the price has now increased on the other one that I have to order. otherwise one does me NO GOOD.."
2,don't get these,"We also were misled into believing that there were 2 ramps for our purchase. Whenwe received only one, we did in fact go and purchase another. To our disgust,the second one shipped WITHOUT the hardware. We are now in the process of sendingBOTH back."
3,ONLY one (1) Ramp,"I too, must join the list of those who thought I was receiving 2 ramps. Unfortunately, I bought it in 2008 and just finally went to use the ramp(s) when I discovered my delima. The ramp appears to be of good product, but I would not have made the purchase if I realized before hand that it was only one ramp."
1,supermans dead,this is how many companies get wealthy in this country. this is our fault because we let this happen. just as they did at w.w.2 concentration camps...the answer for this is clear. if 1 person tried to escape...when caught...they would choose another innocent prisoner to die with them. this must be the way for everyth from our corrupt system of government...to worthless fatcats like this company. they should be kicked off amazon +be forced to choose 1 other innocent company to go as well....then this crap wil stop. my 10-cents.
1,The Same Mistake,"I have just bought this item like 1 hour ago. And I have committed the big mistake of not reading the previous feedback of other costumers. I have just bought the same item again because when I tried to cancel the order 15 minutes after I read the negative feedback, they said that the order could not be canceled. The picture shows 2 ramps, not one. I feel cheated but my mistake was not reading good enough. At the end I am spending more money and not buying the best option."
5,Awsome Deck!,This is an awsome deck!This deck has some awsome features. I like the memoryand the pitch control because I like to rewind without even bother stopping and play my music faster than normal. I highly recommend this unit.THIS IS GREAT FOR DANCE MUSIC!
4,Colorful comic fun for youngsters,"My son first saw this book at our local library. In the case of children's picture books, he definitely judges a book by its cover! The bright yellow and purple caught his eye and the mouse in a sumo stance with an ear-to-ear grin was instantly appealing!We read this book every night for the 2 weeks we had it, and loved it so much that I purchased a copy for my son later. It's still a favorite, and it's not just nice to look at, but it has a sweet message to accompany the comic-like feel.I love reading this book and making up a tune for the theme song on the endpages just as much as my sons enjoy hearing it. I recommend this as a fun book for any home library collection!"
5,Awesome,The book came to me in great order and my son thought it was awesome. I would refer this book to anyone with kids.
5,Works great for me!,I got these knives for Christmas and have used them several times since then. The edges were extremely sharp right out of the box (the box is very nice btw). The handles grip easily and I never feel like they are going to slip out of my hand. I would definitely recommend these knives - even with the bright orange grips! They are a great value and awesome knife.
5,Great Knives,These knives are amazing. Made me realize how mediocre the set I already had actually is. I highly recommend this.
3,"Great knives, but mine rusted.","I got these knives for free when I purchased the cookware, I love how they slice and chop but after using them for a year they rusted. Now it is not safe to use them and I am in need of a good knife. I would like to contact somebody about them but I just don't know who I am supposed to contact.So I am giving them three stars because the are really nice knives they just didn't last as long as I would of liked."
3,"Not Bad, But Not Great","Supposed to be stainless. More like stain quick. Come in a nice bamboo box. Grips are comfortable and easy to handle.Worth the price in a Lightning Deal. But if you're shopping for a high quality knife, you'll end up disappointed with these. Have these and another RR set, both bought at good discounts, so I'm not complaining.Don't leave them in the sink too long if you don't like rust spots on your knives.Ultimately money I would have rather spent on something else.Amazon purchase but long enough ago that it no longer shows."
5,very pleased,I am very pleased with how sharp the knives are. they cut through everythhing with ease. Cleaning them is a snap. They are great I am so glad that I got them.
1,Waste of money,These knives became dull quickly and I've only had them a couple of years and they rusted out and are ruined.
4,Love these Knives,"I think these knives are great. I needed a basic everyday knife - and I didn't want to spend a fortune. I came across this set on sale and it has been brilliant. I take impeccable care of these knives and they have remained sharp and have not shown signs of wear or rusting. The grip is great, even when your hands get wet. I'm sure there are better knives on the market - but not at this price point. I will be buying this set as a gift for several of my family members. I have so enjoyed these knives!"
2,So Sorry Rachael...,"The set is a bit better than regular knives sold at Walmart, but not by much... She wants you to think they are precision made in Germany... but no, China... Poor finish and grinding...Fit of rubber on grip seems cheap and will not keep out residue after cutting... You will have to wipe and oil to keep finish from having spots after cleaning ... Smile all you want to the bank, but these are not professional knives in any sense. Shame on me if I buy anything else you endorse.... You need to return to the candy counter where you began..."
2,I wouldn't buy these,"I got these for free when purchasing my pot set...but, i don't think any knife set is worth this kind of money. Nice packaging, and could make for a very nice partial wedding gift though, being as i haven't even touched them yet."
2,These knives are not sharp! Did I get a bad set????,"I read all the reviews before buying these knives and I hate to say it but they ""suck""! They were only good the first couple of weeks after that the knives got dull. I've had other knives less expensive and have been sharp for a long time. I would think twice or also think about investing in a knive sharpener."
2,"Good steel, bad construction","These appeared to be a great gift - sharp knives, good heft and grip - but after only a year I am seriously disappointed.The handle has come loose from the 7"" knife which has seen the most use. A good knife should last for decades! I would think that a loose handle (there are other reports of similar) is a recall-worthy flaw!Beyond this, the supposed antimicrobial properties of the rubber grip have not prevented a black discoloration that looks like mold from occurring UNDER the rubber at each end of the handle on both knives. No amount of washing seems to remove this ugly blackness.The scalloped steel blade does hold a good edge and I wanted to like these knives and use them for a long time. However, there is no way that I would recommend them based on my experience and what I see to be similar experiences of others."
2,Must have a good teacher,"Many of the explanations in this book are not written clearly. I had to spend quite a bit of time deciphering the material, as it was not clearly explained in class, either. This book in conjunction with a prof who is a good teacher would be find, but if you are on your own for learning from the book, it is not very effective."
3,about webassign,"When this book is bought, does it come with a webassign purchase code?the book is okay by the way."
2,"Fair, many errors in the solution manual","In the main text book it states that the problems were checked, yet this solution manual has so many errors I have to wonder what grade the reviewer received in his calculus class. Some answers are wrong, and some completely misinterpret the entire problem."
3,National Board Workbook,This book was helpful. I was expecting more detailed outlines of the expectations for NBCT. I was hoping for specific rubrics or items necessary for Entry 4. It is still a recommended buy.
2,Warning! Major errors in this title,"I'm just wrapping up my National Boards, and have found several major errors is this book. (Sort of a surprise, considering the publishing company and the ""New! Updated!"" sales pitch.) One is where she comments she's ""reluctant to share her own entries with her candidates."" Sharing actual entries is against the code of ethics for trainers. On page 42 she references a 15 minute video tape for entry one. Nope, no video for that entry. I did use some of the other pieces, but not as many as some of the other books available."
1,Forgetting Something,You forgot about how many customers are so awful that it drives the low wage earning customer service employees to not be as nice as they normally would. I've worked at a movie theater for about a year and started off very friendly now i dont talk to customers at all beyond what is needed for work.
1,Not deserving of any stars,"This book is completely one-sided, and operates under the mistaken belief that the customer is always right. The author obviously never dealt with customers at all. As someone who has been there, I can tell you that the customer is NOT always right. In fact, they are often completely wrong."
1,If you want horrible finacial Loss Buy this book,"This book is a great way to lose your employees, if you've wanted to have to replace your employees over and over again then read this book.Everyone knows that it is cheaper to keep your workers than to have to spend money replacing them.. Its ""helpful idea"" are no more than ravings of a bitter customer. She obviously has no idea how the retail industry works. You only get get good service if you deserve it, if you act like a bad customer then you will be treated like one. The retail worker is not paid enough to kiss your [...]."
5,Really hits home!,"I found this book great, I have been through chemo twice. This book really touches on the emotions you feel during and after chemo. I enjoyed the mind, body and soul connection in this book. Very good reading."
4,My Observations of Norton's Book on Little Round Top,"Many times, a book by a participant involved on the winning side in a battle is very much obscured by bias towards being the winner. However, in this case, Norton has taken the many reports written by the regimental commanders and presented them as is, some with his own added comments. This presents a less biased view. Again, however, reports written days or even weeks after a battle may tend to overlook serious mistakes by leaders, dead or living at the time. But the reading is interesting to the serious student of the Civil War and should be in your library."
5,A guide to this review page,"Some of you may be wondering how a literary travel book about Uzbekistan could possibly provoke the wide range of reactions to be found on this page (everything from accusing the author of plagiarism to leveling ludicous accusations of his being a trust-fund baby). Is it possible that the English speaking world is filled with so many people who, passionately protective of the literary portrayal of Uzbekistan, cannot wait to correct the injustices of talentless grandstanders like Mr. Bissell? Or might it be that Mr. Bissell, who last year wrote a critical article about a group of self-styled literary revolutionaries with a penchant for sophmoric pranks, has puffed up their sense of self-importance enough to send them into feverish action, employing all their wits in the brave, revolutionary task of writing anonymous, character-assassinating amazon.com reviews?"
5,The Bissells,"I have known and loved Bissells. Good people. The Upper Peninsula Bissells are not, however, related to the Lower Michigan Bissells of vacuum cleaner fame. Little Tommy Bissell (what we call him here) has written a lot that we in the U.P. have not always been happy with, but we're proud of him. This is a really good book--especially for a U.P. kid who I watched almost flunk out of high school! I guess Tommy has always been good at making enemies, the ""brainy little know it all"" that he is!! He came and spoke in his home town and we went out to see him. He gave a moving talk and read from Chasing the (Aral) Sea. I'd never heard of it. But now I have. That's a service. I feel smarter. Everyone should leave Tommy alone now and let him write another book."
1,Authorial response,"Yo, Bobby Sherman, from Tashkent. I'm reading with a certain amount of fascination but not posting. I do, however, have friends who, like you, are willing to bend the truth in the fightin' interests of literary bloodsport. Some are not as sneaky as they could be, alas (though I'd like to believe the book has some civilian fans, too: Roxanne Roxanne, where are you?). Or wait: should I call you ""Christy Thompson,"" the woman-dating, Central-Asia-living gal who I noticed also hates Vendela Vida's book? Hey, Bobby, you read any good books on Central Asia lately? No? That's what I thought."
1,The McWeeniazation of Central Asia,"I lived in Central Asia, both as a student and a soldier.Judging by this book, Tom Bissell lived in the United States and wrote this book based on his experiences reading Travel Planet guides in Starbucks.The book is written in a condescending tone, and when it is not merely condescending, it is dehumanizing towards the native population.How many people did Tom actually befriend? How many women did he date? How many Central Asians did he share a laugh or a smoke with? From the tenor, tone, and content of this book, apparently none.[...]Life is not a creative writing workshop assignment. As Hemingway said, ""The world is a fine place and worth fighting for."""
1,This is what he writes???????,"When Uzbekistan's former ambassador to the United States became interested in defecting to America, for instance, his daughter, Nadira Khidoiatova, was soon arrested on drug-smuggling charges. Khidoiatova was pregnant, and under Uzbek law was therefore supposed to have been released on bond. The Uzbek authorities sidestepped this nicety by forcibly aborting her fetus. The former ambassador, for his part, now lived under protection in the United States."
1,Garbage!,"This is the worst travel book I've ever read! It is totally ignorant! Tom Bissell should have stayed out in the sticks of Escanaba, Michigan. What's the point of travelling if it only makes you a more strident white supremacist? The book contains loads of very racist remarks about Uzbeks and Central Asians. He frequently strays away from his intended subject matter, which was supposed to be the Aral Sea, to share his air-head sensibilities. This book is a total waste of time and no one who truly values being informed would enjoy a book about Central Asia written by an Archie Bunker wannabe! This book really makes Americans look like stupid fools."
4,A travel story about Uzbekistan.,"I like this book, although I disagree with some of the politics and attitudes of the author. His wit and story telling give this book much of its appeal. The one thing that is not good about this book is the short focus on the Aral Sea. The sea and the tragedy of its evaporation should be one of concern for the whole world.The one thing that I dislike about this book is its condescending attitude toward the natives. Even Tom's Peace Corps family is savaged by his wit. This must have been a stab in the back to them if they ever read his book. I appreciated his wit, but some other readers might not.The book flows amazingly well. It took me some time to read this book, but I liked the stories of his concerning Bokhara and the other cities. After reading some of the other reviews, I was a little concerned about his sources. However, this is a great read from a little known author. I rate him better than Robert Kaplan."
2,Where Have All The Editors Gone?,"I read the Harper's piece that Bissell wrote about the Aral Sea and it was great - it certainly fired up my interest. Then I read the book and I found myself wishing that he'd let the editors at Harpers take a pass at it.Overlong, and filled with details that were neither illuminating nor interesting. Particularly irritating is Bissell's diatribe against writer Robert Kaplan. Whether Bissell is right or wrong, the spleen has no place in a book about HIS impressions of Uzbekistan. Ultimately, who cares if another writer got it wrong, it's completely immaterial.This would have been a very interesting book if it remembered to get to the point and stay focussed."
3,Many writing samples,"Tom Bissell is a fabulous writer. Indeed many of his writing samples grace this very page. For a compelling glimpse inside his fertile mind, just read the incisive rebuttals that he has written to the negative commentary on his book under his many pseudonyms (e.g. ""a reader""). Ruthlessly piercing the veils that his detractors hide behind, Bissell identifies the dark motive that drives them all - jealousy!"
2,Not Very Good,"I have read various passages in this book, and while the basic intent seems up to snuff, the heart and soul are lacking, and thus the execution falls short. One of the passages which first alerted me to the shortcomings was Bissell's experience riding in a train car, and relating it to the death trains of WWII. Not only is such a comment out of context, but it also seems as irreverent as it is irrelevant.Even though it seems Mr. Bissell traveled to Central Asia, it doesn't seem he ever leaves Manhattan. All of Central Asia is centered about him throughout the book, which would be fine if it were a work of fiction.The book seems warped by a strange field: a sense of insiderism--from beginning to end. Much of it seems overwritten.Alas, it is a first book from a seemingly inexperienced author. Let's hope for more content and less hype next time."
4,Cool book bro!,"""Chasing the Sea"" has a character who says things like ""dude"" and ""bro,"" over and over and over again. He says dude and bro for 300 pages. But other than this it's a cool book. Not much of the book ""stayed"" with me, though...other than the stuck ships in the salty sand at the end. That stayed with me. I think I wrote this because I think I like its Amazon page better than the book. That's entertaining bro."
5,Undone and a nice complication has been released,"As many reviewers have stated Undone is the better of the two releases and now Undone has been released on CD along with a compliation cd with several bsides and 12"" (those were the days when the 12"" release contained extra tracks!!) called Remembrances is released. Both cd's are on the U.S. indie lable Words of Music, which also has some other great indie bands on the label."
4,Great for Nostalgia,"I had this album back in the 80s, and figured I'd see how it held up. I don't think it would win any new fans, but if you liked it then it is great fun to hear it again."
1,STUPID,"I read Deep Trouble when I was in middle school and loved it just because it featured a mermaid. A couple years later I saw that they made the TV version and I was thrilled. I couldn't wait to see how they would portray the mermaid, etc. I watched the entire thing and not ONE mermaid-they didn't even MENTION mermaids. The story line is completely different then ""Deep Trouble"". I read another review and they said the story was more like ""Deep Trouble II"". If that is the case WHY DIDN'T THEY CALL IT ""DEEP TROUBLE II""!!!! Obviously I was very let down..."
3,It was just ok,"When I bought this dvd I was expecting it to have mermaids in it, like some of the other reviews said. I actually thought this dvd was more like deep trouble 2, so if its more like the second one why don't they call it deep trouble 2 then. Anyways this episodes was about two kids Brother and sister, Sheena and Billy who are on summer vacation with there uncle harold at his science lab. I thought the pacing in this episodes was a little slow and I felt like I was just waiting a long time for something scary to happen. I probably would have given this episode a 4 if everything didn't look so fake. When they showed all the giant animals it looked so fake and silly. If you really like the goosebumps series this episode is still worth watching."
3,wrong movie,"While I got what I ordered and the seller exceeded all expectations; the movie didn't turn out to be what I wanted. I was teaching the book ""Deep Trouble"" and thought it would be a great addition, but the movie actually looks closer to the book ""Deep Trouble II""."
2,Pain,Easy to assemble once you put a huge hole in the door - was looking for a privacy lock for my room and this had the same dimensions as my passage door knob so I bought it but it requires a huge hole in the wall - Schlage products are a huge pain to buy here in Australia as no one seems to stock them so this is disappointing and will sit in my shed until I can use it for something else.
5,Excellent Product--Long Playing Time,"This unit is very sturdy, very convenient, and full of features.This MP3 player gives me the full features of a standard Walkman (do you remember Walkman's from the 1980's) in MP3 format. The price is superior to its competitors when you consider the features and functionality. But best of all when you purchase an additional 64MB Smart Media card, you will get two full hours of CD quality playing time...."
2,Kinda Lame,"This thing is deceptively small, like less than 2"" wide. It wears out very quickly...you might get a few days of sparks, then it's gone."
4,Tail Devils,"They are really cool in the dark(Halloween) my son loved them. However, they wear out rather quickly, it was fun while it lasted. Definitely worth a try."
1,this is the most stupid juvinile art ever!,i don't know who even gave the person who did this art a funding to create such a book. but its just ridiculous. for 5 year olds.
4,"""Who's You're Friend?""","Sean Egan helps Sarah Talbot find the ones who were respondsible for her son's death. Unable to get help from the British police, Sean relies in his network of friends. The problem is though that some are not his friends at all when drug money gets involed. A good read with a surprising ending."
4,Classic Higgins,"Fast moving, entertaining, the classic military suspense/spy genre thriller. Higgins always delivers with good reads that aren't so heavy on the technical detail that can drone on, and plagues the genre. A great pool, plane, or snowy day read."
5,Another story by Jack Higgins,"As with all of Jack Higgins story, the best is saved till last. I have been reading Jack's stories for many years. I never get tired of these tales of adventure. Another great story."
4,and then there was light,"I love these lights. After trying two differnt single type lighting kits I finally purchashed this for half the price of the others. I have an outlet above my cabinets and was able to just plug it in and use a switch near my sink. I bought two for the corner of my kitchen. There is a dim light that I use as a nightlight and a bright light for while I am cooking.Mounting it was simple, maybe 1o minutes.The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the platic package (inside the box) was covered with dirt and dust and should have been wiped down before shipping."
4,quality,"this cd is worth buying, as it has more than just one good song on it. in fact, just about all of the songs are pretty good if you like other things by world party. note that though it seems that if you like one song you'll like the others on this cd, the songs are significantly different from each other; it's not just basically the same song over and over as with most pop bands. enjoy!"
4,Excellent,"This album has something for every fan. With a superb backing band (including guitar legend Mick Ronson), Mc Guinn has crafted an entertaining group of songs. Of particular note are ""Take Me Away,"" ""Jolly Roger,"" and the gritty ""Rock and Roll Time"" (co-written with Bobby Neuwirth and Kris Kristofferson). The rendition of ""Pretty Polly"" included on this album has a much folksier edge than the version on the Byrds box set, and features some of McGuinn's excellent banjo work. There is not a bad cut on the entire album, which is worth the effort to locate. Well done, Roger!"
4,Roger flew the Coop,"The Byrds, of course, were one of the best folk-rock bands of all time. However, any truly great artist has an album like this one in him or her that goes beyond the ""group"". This album could not have been made with the Byrds. It has a raw edge that is fantastic. ""Jolly Roger"" raises a chill everytime I hear it. I want to explode with the raw emotion heard in it. ""Rock and Roll Time"" is a gritty tribute to the drive of real music. There is not a bad cut on the entire album. I strongly recommend this album to any and all music lovers."
1,WHATEVER!,"I was so looking forward to getting and finally hearing this highly recommended album from Roger McGuinn. Honestly, I do not understand all of the accolades for this album! I am a Byrds fan and have heard other solo music from Roger but this one is just plain BAD!!!!!!!! What garners ""critical acclaim"" anymore is beyond me. If it wasn't for ""pretty polly"", the entire record would be a dud! The cover of Bowie's ""soul love"" is hideous and pointless. Gee, that just described the entire thing in a nutshell for me! A really loooong hour to sit through a bad record when there are so many legitimate great ones!"
3,Works with Windows 7 only,"Apparently, this disc ONLY works on Windows 7. Amazon really SHOULD advertise this fact. I was disappionted that I could not watch it on my Tv."
5,"This CD is so ""beautiful and soulful"".","My sweetheart played the Chris Walker ""First Time"" CD for me last week and I fell in love with it instantly! I especially love ""Someday"" featuring Lisa Fischer, ""I Just Can't Stop"", and ""Giving You All of My Love"". Chris and Lisa's harmonies blend so nicely on ""Someday"" and I get a nice loving feeling just listening to them. And ""Someday"" applies to me and my sweetheart because we were separated for many years and found our way back to each other and our love. This CD really has a little something for everyone and even has Rap on the ""Take Time"" cut. I love it!! Great CD Chris, this one will always be one of my favorites!!"
5,terrific,love his music . Wished he had more recordings. Cherish this one and add to your collection and enjoy the listening
4,Nice,"I thought a good number of your songs required quite a bit of skill and some depth to write. Of course, this is why you are popular in many circles. You know I disagree with some of the things you say, but there are many things that every person experiences, unless their emotions have been completely dulled by drugs or something. There's hope guys."
4,"First half of cd is awsome, the rest is ok.","As a prog rocker, I'm used to a little more change up in songs on an album. Although a lot of the songs sound the same, but different enough to hold my interest. Makes me want to hear thier next cd."
3,"Not bad, not good. Just kinda 'eh...' (3 Stars)","This is a terrifically average effort. I don't know, maybe their live shows are great. But it apparently doesn't translate to much in the studio. The first Amazon review says it all. You've heard a dozen bands that sound like this before. It's been done... and better. I know that will just erk the hell out of some CWK fans. I'm not writing this to get a rise out of anyone, but sometimes the truth hurts. Hey, maybe it will grow on me but I'm not counting on it..."
5,Rock Is Alive And Well,"Cold War Kids revives alternative rock from its grave with this CD. At a time when every band's singer sounds the same and every guitar riff is identical, Cold War Kids brings something new and invigorating to the scene. It's about time!I was giving up hope on alternative until I heard Robbers & Cowards. Not a slow or bad track on it. Well worth the time and cash investment."
5,Yez Yez,"Not sure when the last time I was this into an indie rock album, but it was probably when the Arcade Fire released Funeral. They don't sound like the Arcard Fire, but it's just honestly good music in it's essence. The rawness is accurate, but it's not all experimentally crammed with instruments. There are a few different ones, but not excessive like Mystery Jets or anything. I was put off by another review and was thinking people would be playing with cooking utensils or something, but I assure you that's not the case. A+ and sincere."
4,not Maroon 5???,"It's funny reading through all these reviews that no one has noticed how much they sound like Maroon 5! In fact, I'd go as far to say that this is a Maroon 5 sound-alike band (even the lead singer's voice).Now don't get me wrong, I love Maroon 5... and I really like this CD. But, you gotta call a spade a spade, and this CD is in no way paving an original path. However, the first few songs on this CD are excellent, and rival anything Maroon 5 has done."
5,Spot-On Swinging Big Band Sound. Great Jazz Vocal CD of great Standards!,"A perfect CD for my Jazz collection of albums. Peggy Lee has the perfect voice and pitch, to make songs like ""Close Your Eyes"",""The Best is Yet to Come"", ""The Man I Love"" & many other great tracks.A wonderful compilation of songs, too!"
4,Candied fruit.,"I liked the combination of cherry and Pineapple, however there was not enough green cherries and pineapple. I still would recommend it."
4,"For computer illiterate people is fine...but.../Para alguien analfabeto en computacion esta bien,pero...","[...]for someone with at least basic level of computer knowledge will be a little redundantotherwise I would have paid good money for this book back in the day wheni was ""behind"" in computer technology!well,i guess this was made just in time for my mom to learn itwithout having to ""put up"" with my teaching method.[...]"
3,Excellent Research & Flawed Conclusions,"Mason covers the history of legal custody with the exacting detail of a trained scholar. However, her conclusion that the ""best interest of the child,"" is best served without regard for the best best interest of the parent will give an entire new generation of judiciary the opportunity to vacate parent's civil rights in favor of their children and the state.Her idea of giving each child in a divorce their own legal representation will most certainly serve the best interests of attorneys everywhere, while leaving middle-class parents pennyless in their pursuit of justice.For legal education and precedent this book rates a 10. For the long-term health of civilization, it deserves a 0."
3,left me feeling confused,"I didn't really understand the movie. I had trouble understanding what was supposed to be comedy and what was supposed to be drama. I THINK the drama parts were good, but the next part of the movie, the supposed comedy part, didn't really seem funny to me. Again, I had trouble figuring out which was which!I didn't understand if we, the viewers, were supposed to laugh during the comedy segments, or maybe it was only supposed to be funny for the characters interacting with each other.As a drama movie, it was pretty typical. As a comedy... well, it wasn't for me. Whatever it was, I'm confused. It deserves credit for blending both comedy and drama together, though. If that's what it did, of course."
2,"Interesting Idea, Not Great Execution, 2.5 Stars","Typical Woody Allen characters: pseudo intellectual New Yorkers pondering over the tragic or comic life path of a woman, Melinda, played reasonably well in a duel role by Radha Mitchell. The story unfolds quickly to reveal the simultaneous paths of Melinda as a tragic alcoholic basket case and as an insouciant romantic. Sounds like the makings for a classic Woody Allen flick. Unfortunately nothing really works. Melinda is a very unlikable character in either situation as are all of the people in either story line. Furthermore, Will Ferrell is not convincing as the bumbling, neurotic character normally played by Woody Allen (Allen is just too old to pull it off anymore). Allen was too good at it and Farrell is not. In the end it is just not well represented among the body of Woody Allen's work."
3,"Obviously, this's a love-it-or-hate-it film . . .","Some viewers/reviewers think this's too much the standard W.Allen movie and others think it's not enough like what W.A. has done before. I give it stars for a great film maker trying something different and reducing stars for not quite making it.This is Maestro Allen's most good/bad film. Parts worked, other's didn't. Still it was of course better than most such flicks by mere mortals. Maybe it will work better in re-viewing; perhaps the confusions of Melindas will become less distracting and W. Ferret will seem not to be doing a lame version of W.Allen. Whatever, the movie swings from incomprehension of and grimaces for the plight of its characters to chuckles at their mishaps and human failings.Three stars for the movie: Five stars for it being a, but not-quite successful, experiment from W.Allen; minus one for casting Ferret and minus one more for confusion and lack of expected W.Allen grace, sophistication and originality = 3."
2,A comedy?,"This film isnt funny. It goes to prove that a Woody Allen movie without Woody Allen isnt great. Instead you have Farrell trying to act like a neurotic Allen. He's ok, but isnt really fun. Lacking the Woody Allen charm, which is important in his movies."
1,Making Comparisons,"So many major companies are expanding in so many new and interesting ways that Amazon's routine listing of this film set me to wondering if Amazon might not be ready to take a small experimental step in some new and original directions.If so, this might be a good place to start. This film is a poor imitation of a truly delightful and joyous film titled ""Holiday for Henrietta"" (La Fete a Henriette), which is difficult to obtain. What if Amazon used some of its resources to reissue it? Might that not be an opportunity for Amazon to break some new ground and perhaps open some new horizons for itself?"
3,Average fare from Allen,"I like Woody Allen movies and have recently started to watch his entire catalog. I think people compare a great director with is earlier works and this becomes the problem. Radha Mitchell plays the lead character Melinda with great finesse. Melinda number one is a old high school friend who comes in unannounced and Melinda number 2 is a neighbor who crashes a party. It has a lot of famous names but Carell, Farrell and Sevigny are all wasted. The writing is superb in some instances but on the whole it is not a great movie. I also thought the ending was not clever and felt forced. I give it 2.5 stars 120409"
3,Looking for Woody,"Woody Allen, in his long career as a comic, writer, actor, producer and director has worked many themes but the urban (usually New York City his home turf) slices of life are usually the best. Here Woody takes a tragic-comic, or is it comedic-tragic look at the trials and tribulations of an off-beat New York society girl Melinda as filtered through a comedy director's and a tragedy director's vision of the story line. Some amusing moments, especially for a hapless Woody wannabe character who falls in love with the comic version of Melinda. Nothing profound here and nothing that Woody hasn't analyzed a hundred times before but a very nice racially-mixed ensemble cast (it is New York in the 2000's, remember) does a nice job with the material as Woody enters the 21st century."
4,An Enjoyable Woody Allen Flick,"Woody Allen is clearly held to higher standard than most film directors. Is this because he has benchmarked the film industry with classics such as Annie Hall and Manhattan? Perhaps it is due to his longevity in an unforgiving industry despite failures, both personal and professional? Is it because of his brilliance-- creating film in genres as diverse as Bananas and Match Point?The expectation is that a woody Allen film should be better than most, and this one is. Its not his top dog, and it isn't brilliant, and that will no doubt bother many critics.Woody Allen has been deconstructed many, many times (See, for example, Deconstructing Harry) so it is refreshing to see this film where Allen steps outside himself by setting up a story line and allowing it to follow two paths. For some, it becomes tragedy, and others, comedy.It is not Allen's deepest film, but it worth watching and enjoying."
3,Fine,"The tape is working fine till now after many repeated recordings in my 8mm camcorder. The price...for two tapes is not much but i think you can also get other tapes like sony for this price or some dollars more. The quality of the plastic used to manufacture this tape is not good though but there is no need to look after it as the basic function is to record and play, for that its fine."
4,Great Product,Fuji tapes are good quality at a cheap price. These tapes work well basically with any 8mm (I'm pretty sure). Great product. Thanks again.
2,8mm tapes,well i got this for my camera but was the wrong size so i could return it could i opened them
4,Great replacements,"Popovers are a tradition in my family, and when I could not find the old standby 11 cup cast iron pan, I was devastated. I wanted to get some pans for my children to carry on the tradition, and the cast iron pans are just so much superior to any of the aluminum ""air"" pans. I was worried that these Cajun Cookware pans might not be big enough. I took and a chance, and I was not disappointed. They are a little smaller but with appropriate seasoning, the popovers popped to perfection, and did not stick in the pan, even with the first batch! I also tried the six cup pans. They worked fine, but they are not as easy to handle when hot, and they are much smaller. I have since ordered another 3 pans, received them on time and in good order. For those of you looking for a good 11 cup pan for popovers, these work great!"
5,The purpose of this book...,The purpose of this book is to show others precisely how we have recovered [Foreword to the 3rd Edition - Alcoholics Anonymous]. Rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path [Chapter 5 - Alcoholics Anonymous].
5,Regarding Stanton Peele,"Some have mentioned Stanton Peele. From what I have been able to learn he does not mention that he has ever been an alcoholic or an addict. I do not think it's possible for him therefore to understand the book ""Alcoholics Anonymous,"" which gives an incredibly exact description of alcoholism in practice.I've read the book many times from 1978 to the present. It never claims to be the only way, referring to itself as suggested only. It actually welcomes other methods, aids to recovery, if something shows results the book welcomes it, and it does not deter any from seeking any other method.What the courts do or do not do is irrelevant to the value of this book. If you are alcoholic, you may be desperate and you my find hope in this book that you can be helped out of alcoholic torture.A brief visit to Stanton Peele's web site revealed an article about how drunkeness can serve a useful purpose. Hardly the thing an alcoholic needs to hear."
2,A good idea that's gone haywire,"No one can blame an enthusiastic stockbroker for trying to devise a program to help rehabilitate drunkards. OK, so the drunks are sober, that's great, but what can be done to help them find real mental and emotional health? In effect, the Big Book and the religion which sprang from it recreates the Christian model (though somewhat camouflaged and customized for alcoholics). Sin, confession, prayer, redemption... in many ways, the Big Book leads alcoholics back to church, but through the ""back door"", and with ""blind folds"" on. The stories of personal recovery are great, albeit dated, but the steps and the religosity have started quite a bit of controversy. (e.g. why is the DISEASE of alcoholism the only known disease with a religious solution?) Before committing one's life to the practices outlined in this book, it might be wise to acquaint oneself with both the pro and the con sides of the ""religious solution for alcoholics"" argument."
3,arp,"We bought this to better understand the group we were asked to help with. The authors had great insight, even inspiration when putting this account together."
1,outdated religious folklore w/ no scientific support,"alcoholics annonymous the basic text is outdated. there are no scientific research studies cited in it anywhere. it is religious folklore. the "" big book"" is NOT the only answer for those with a drinking proplem."
1,poorly written and unscientific,"this book basically describes ""how to be a good cult member in 12 silly steps"". This book has the potential of harming lots of innocent people."
1,An Important Quote,"""There goes many a ship to sea, with many hundred souls in one ship, whose weal and woe is common, and is a true picture of a commonwealth, or a human combination or society. It hath fallen out sometimes, that both papists and protestants, Jews and Turks, may be embarked in one ship; upon which supposal I affirm, that all the liberty of conscience, that ever I pleaded for, turns upon these two hinges--that none of the papists, protestants, Jews, or Turks be forced to come to the ship's prayers or worship, if they practice any. I further add, that I never denied, that notwithstanding this liberty, the commander of this ship ought to command the ship's course, yea, and also command that justice, peace and sobriety, be kept and practiced both among the seamen and all the passengers.""Roger WilliamsLetter to the Town of Providence1654"
4,I have read this book many times!,"I have read this book many times! Reading this book and following the simple program that is outlined in it, I have been sober and alcohol free for 23 years. I highly recommend it to any one interested in alcohol recovery. PS. There are also chapters concerning family, employers and helping others to over come their alcohol consumption. A good basic text book that has laid the original twelve step programs foundaations. Hope you all enjoy it as I have. :-) Thanks Mike L. END"
5,The definitive book on recovery from alcoholism.,"There has never been a book written by alcoholics, for alcoholics about alcoholism that has actually provided the problem and solution to one of humankind's worst maladies. Written in 1938, it has stood the test of time and has led millions toward recovery through the twelve steps. Pages 1 through 164 provide the necessary background and spiritual remedies that can aid in the recovery of one of the deadliest illnesses known to man. The rest of the text contains stories that relate to the experience of those who have recovered from a ""seemingly hopeless state of mind and body"""
5,Essential for recovering alcoholic,This is such a wise book and a must for alcoholics in recovery. I use it every day. Changed my life along with meetings and fellowship.
5,Marraige Counseling/Therapy,"Terrific book in terms identifying seven common Marriage conflicts which dating an engaged couples should read . In addition, Premarriage Counseling and or Workshops should recommended that participants read this in order to be aware of these potential conflicts in order to prevent and resolve them in a health and productive manner ."
4,The Seven Conflicts . . . in Marriage,"This is a very fine book on this subject, written in easy to read style, dealing with the really deep issues which cause conflicts in marriage and suggest solutions.The book was ordered through Amazon.com and arrived in excellent condition in very quick time. Well done."
5,Must reading for all Christians,"J.E.Stiles writes in a way that is appreciative of those who accept the gift, without condemning those who do not.The author gives scriptural proof that the gift is for all those who would accept and is not for biblical times only.He covers everything that the various denominations disagree about including the gift of tongues, with no judgement.He takes us through the book in an almost textbook style,yet keeping our interest, he unveils our fears which hold us back, then leads us to a ""how to receive"" section and ends the book with a very practical and scripturally relevant question and answer section.With this book, knowledge truly is power ! for the reviewers at amazon I know the person who has the reprint rights to this book and can get them for you new ! Thanks,Pastor Gregory Hall"
4,"A ""Hit"" For Young Baseball Fans","When I was recently looking for a book for a very young baseball hopeful, I came across H IS FOR HOME RUN. The book is more than an ""alphabet book."" It not only has an appropriate baseball term or tidbit of baseball for each letter, it also has an informative bit of baseball information. The text is well written and the illustrations are marvelous. It is the perfect book for any young slugger, but I can also see it being helpful for baseball illiterates like me-people who pretends to know something about the sport but are to embarrassed to ask."
5,Great Book!,"My favortie things about the book are:1: Beautiful painted illustrations. I would hang these on my wall!2: The option to read the simple ""F is for flyball"" or read the extra baseball info and fun facts written to the side as the kids get older.My 3 and 6 year old boys love it! Great book for kids and parents who like baseball."
4,Pistol Pete's Best Game as a Pro,"This appears to be a live television broadcast with the New York Knicks commentators as Pistol Pete Maravich wows them in the Superdome in New Orleans with 68 points. My only quarrel with the DVD is that they did not show some of his missed shots (though he didn't miss many that night), and that makes him seem a little more superhuman than he was. Had those been included, I would have given five stars. During breaks in the game, various Jazz spokesmen, sportswriters, Pete's lawyer, and Pete's step-brother, Ronnie, reflect back on the times. James Dobson also recalls the moment of Pete's death. These insertions are brief and do not interrupt the flow of the game. Hearing the reaction of the announcers is a big part of the fun. Look for two horrible charging calls that gave Pete his fifth and sixth fouls. Both should have been blocking fouls on Tom McMillen, and Pete would probably have ended the night with about 75 points."
1,Disapointing,"This kite is very heavy. you need a very strong wind to have it up in the air.so, I'm sorry I bought it."
1,It is a baby kite,I've never seen a kite this small and it is a silly idea to make one so small. Don't buy it!
1,So fun! For a few minutes,"This kite was easy to get up, fun and easy to fly, but disappointing because the tail was glued on and came off after a few minutes. I would have glued it back on, but we lost it over water."
2,"Convenient, but poor flier","Cool idea, but this one isn't a winner as far as its flight qualities. Wish it acted more like a wing."
2,"If you are looking for a slick production, forget it","This is a great performance, but, it was taped so poorly.It was taped with one camera, from the same position,throughout the taping. It appears to be done with a VHScamera, so it is not very sharp. The cameraman appears tobe using the autofocus, thus the image stays out of focustoo long. On the DVD box, it does say that this concertwas not produced by a professional. It's sad that a musician of J. J.'s caliber didn't have someone of equaltalent taping this event."
3,ASICS Run Pant,Feels like an odd fit so I use them as a layer and this works fine since I live in a colder part of the country.
4,Great music. Period.,"This is an album which reveals more pleasures with each subsequent listen, not unlike his first two albums. I would have given it three stars after a single listen, but having spent some time with it (now on an amazing DVD-A), this jewel is shining brighter.I thought ""Human Beings"" was a tad boring, but THIS disc starts off with four solid tunes straight off the top.Seal and Trevor Horn have a relationship like Michael Jackson & Quincy Jones...a particular producer who brings out only the best of a particular performer.""Get It Together"", ""My Vision""...heck, it ALL soars like great Seal records should.If you're wondering where our new Marvin Gaye, our new Stevie Wonder, our new male classic R&B soul god is, he's right here.This isn't the best place to start if you're curious about Seal as an artist (try albums #1 or #2), but I guarantee you that if you are interested in ANY of his works, you'll like this one.You'll need this one."
2,Pass,"Seal is one of my all-time favorite artists. I've been a huge fan since the beginning, and his live performances are not to miss. However, this last album does not even approach the standard set by his earlier recordings. Check out Human Being instead."
4,not your typical Seal,"Usually I find Seal a bit sappy. Despite his soft seductive vocal quality Seal songs are often mostly sorrow, sorrow, sadness and longing. It's simply hard to listen to when you don't already want to cry. This album has dynamics. There are songs to dance to, some Reggae beats and yes more sorrow. Seal sings that ""it sounds like another one of my sad songs"" but I don't mind. Somehow these tunes are infused with more soul than usual. The sad songs are musically up to par with ""Song for the Dying"" but his poetic expression is better than anything before. Start with sampling ""Let me Roll"" and ""Love's Devine""."
3,"Disappointing, and really cheap packaging","Even a bad Seal album is pretty good, but this is a bit disappointing after years of waiting. The cardboard packaging this cd is encased in is the worst cd packaging i've ever seen."
3,Not Progressive,"Seal's voice, Trevor's production, and the musicians' performances are as gorgeous as ever, but where's the songwriting? This is a danceable pop album, done with class, but it's an album that doesn't feature: (1) even just one really good single like the FIRST album, (2) some tantalizing time signatures like the 7/8 on the SECOND album, or (3) any risk-taking like the THIRD album (even if you didn't like Human Being it was still good art). Seal, I'm dyin' to know what was on Togetherland, please release it!"
4,Seal Steals My Heart,What a refreshing cd! Finally some music that was worth the money I spent on it. I am so glad to see Seal back on the music scene. I can't stop listening to his new album. It's mellow and romantic yet sophisticated and contemporary all at the same time. This cd deserves a place on your cd tower!
2,Disappointing,It sounds like I warped back into the seventies listening to this cd! I was anticipating so much more after so many years. very disappointing.
4,My 2 cents worth....,"Not as good as Seal 2, better than Human Beings and the package gives the impression they rushed the CD to make the release date. There are some enjoyable songs on here, but it is not taking me to the same place that his second release did. If you like Seal it's worth the buy, if you want to discover Seal get the first or second CD."
5,His Best Work Since His Debut,"Seal delivers a thorough, solid collection of ballads and pop song craft perfection on his fourth album. Producer Trevor Horn is a master at integrating classical arrangements to enhance Seal's vocals. This album is only slightly below Seal's remarkable debut album that remains one of the greatest R&B/Soul albums of the last 2 decades. Highlight tracks include the beautiful ballad ""Love's Divine,"" the energy of ""Let Me Roll,"" and the disco-radio-electronica sound of ""Get It Together."" A fine collection of songs to add to your CD collection for listening to for many years to come."
5,Definitely worth Getting,"After being sadly disappointed with his third album, this was worth the wait. My first play thru was one of curiosity, my repeated play-thru's were out of excitement and joy that He was Back. Its a great album displaying his wide depth and range of style and vocals. Definitely one that stays in the car."
5,Seal Strikes Back with a A+,"Seal is still blazing he hasnt lost is touch, not one bit. His voice is still gonna make you wanna take a girl to bed and new songs deliberatly speaks for themselves. Its an educational record with high powers and other level of sounds. It feels like he recorded this album with a live band in one take just push play and let it ride until your girl has an orgasm"
5,Great ride to work.,"I love this CD. Seal is a great singer, it makes the ride to work something to look forward to."
4,DON'T LISTEN TO THISCD FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH THE LIGHTS ON,"Seal's music has been very close to me for me for the past 9 years. It got me through my life in high school. I'm 19 now. I Bought this album last night around 8:30. I got home, sat on the sofa(lights on), and utterly critiqued this album. I wasn't very impressed by the first 4 songs(they're too original soul for my tastes but maybe they'll grow on me) and the rest of the album just wasn't moving me. What was I thinking?? You can't listen to a Seal album for the first time with the lights on now can you? So around 1:30 a.m. I strolled out to my car in the blue moonlight, lit a cigarette, and fell in love. It moved me. Listen to Lonliest Star and you'll hear what I mean. MY LOVE GOES OUT TO SEAL, TREVOR, AND ALL THE REST OF THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS ALBUM POSSIBLE."
3,Seal...,"Seal is an extraordinary musician. Warm tone and soulful rhythms are only a small portion of his character. This album... well, i dont know. From first listened it is a happy club album. It lacks the more deep stlye found on the ""Human Beings"" album. Maybe as listeners we have adjusted to this sound, but after hearing this happy, semi trippy debut( similar to the first album). it leaves his followers in confusion. styles change. music transforms, but sometimes it may be too much.... first listen i give this album a 2. after it grows on you, you can appreciate the art born from the mind of this great musician and provide it an extra star, but leaving it at a loss in comparison to previous albums."
5,Five years is a long wait...,"Five years is a long wait for a new Seal album. TOO long. I've been listening to this over VH1's website for the last week and now, finally, have my copy. He has done it again. Beautifully produced ballads that highlight the essence of Seal's vocal expressions. All I have to say is - buy it - enjoy it - and let's hope we don't have to wait another five years for the next one.Anxiously awaiting the tour....Andrew Sandberg"
4,Why is this NOT getting U.S. airplay?,"I think the answer is Seal's deliberate attempt not to release an ""American Idol""-type commercial waste, but a personal product that encompasses all his particular tastes while showcasing his faint 2-pack-a-day raspiness.I thought most of the album was awesome, especially the message-themed anthem ""Get It Together"" and the Motown session-ish ""Let Me Roll"". ""Waiting For You"" seems to be the obvious standout among these reviewers, and it is a little reminiscent of Lenny Kravitz' sound to me. I just wish radio stations would give some of these songs some play; grownups don't have a lot of choices: between pop candy and hip-hop, the only thing we seem to get are ""old school"" stations. Here's a recording that has at least four songs that should receive heavy rotation opportunities!"
5,"""I have been waiting for you""....................","Okay, just bought this CD - and I have had this song stuck in my head all day - how lucky! His voice is so great - and the tracks on this CD seem to have a bit more funk to them. But, it is still classic Seal - beautiful voice, soaring music, low-key relaxed style................... I really like this CD."
4,Welcome Back,"Let's be honest: Seal could sing the phonebook and we'd all still listen. His voice is soulful, distinctive, and a welcome breath on the radio from the usual vocal gymnastics and overblown production. True, Seal IV isn't as complete as his first two CDs or as moody yet atmospheric as Human Beings. But this is still great Seal. The Motown sound suits his smoky vocals well. The 1-2-3 punch of Get It Together, Love's Divine, and Waiting For You is a promising beginning. The CD does seem to lag toward the middle, while remaining enjoyable. Luckily, Heavenly is reminiscient of Violet (one of my favorite Seal tracks) and Tinsel Town ends the CD on a smooth note. Not innovative Seal. But well worth the wait, like an old friend coming home."
3,"some good songs, but disappointing","I'm a big fan of Seal's first three albums. I like a few songs on the new one, but it just feels a little thin and uninspired compared to his usual stuff. The opening song is a very cool modern take on disco, but lacks the depth of ""The Beginning,"" ""Bring it On,"" or ""Human Beings"" (The first songs on his first three albums). There's even a ballad on the new one that sounds like it belongs on American Idol more than a Seal album. I probably sound snobbish, but I've come to expect a more distinctive sound from Seal. I get the sense on most of this one that he was really trying to be sincere while trying to be more accessible, which just feels a little lukewarm in the end. I'm a little sad."
5,What an inspiration!,"There's something about this album that makes you want to get up and face the world. It touches that part of you that will never be jaded, that you may have forgotten existed. For me the mark of a good album is that it can be listened to as a whole, be distinct from song to song, yet feel as though it's one work of art. Seal IV is one of those rare albums."
2,Decent print quality,"I got this printer from Walmart at a cheap price. I am happy with the print quality and don't mind the loud noise and shake pretty good.The disappointment I have is that this damn printer eat up ink way to fast for my liking. Eat up a set of cartrige with probably less than 100 pages. I print mostly black color. But where the hack is my color ink go? It is dry up about the same time as black ink. Like other reviewer says, sell us the cheap printer but rape us with the inks.Update, I can't take it any more. This printer sucks the ink dry with less than 50 pages and yes mostly printed in black color. But the color ink is dried up as well. The Cl40/41 are to expensive for 50 pages of prints. I will dump this piece of crap into the trash can soon and replace it with a color laser printer for cost effective in the long run."
5,Inexpensive printer.,"This is a very good printer, especially for the low price. It does everything I want it to do, prints black and color beautifully."
2,"Cheap, cheap, cheap - you get what you pay for","This printer is a mess. Yes, it's inexpensive (mine was free with rebate). But it's your classic loss leader, ""razor and blade"" model - give the printer (razor) away, stick it to the customer on cartridges (blades). Canon software for this printer is programmed to reject refilled cartridges, even good ones. The printer routinely breaks in some fashion or another. Streaky, substandard printing, even with Canon carts. In short, the hassle factor of owning this printer FAR exceeds the savings you might get. In simple terms, STAY AWAY!"
2,Ok for a disposable printer,The printed output is not really all that good. But it works for me. Have had it for 6 months or so but only print a couple of pages a month. When the ink goes out I will buy another printer as the ink refill costs are just too much.
3,need some help,"this is my third canon pixma. my other two were the pixma 4000and the 8500 pixma. i could see no difference in the output. my prolem is that with my latest is that the colors of the finAL print zre too msgenta and too light. i utilize the ez print software. though the canons are good printers, i'm looking to see if this one goes bad, if so i'll check another brand. i do have to say the canon techs were very helpful but they did not correct the problem. any idea what happened to the 4000 to give the prints rgalleg1@san.rr.com"
2,just okay,The only reason I purchased this item was because I had just bought new ink cartridges for the old printer that died. Why does ink cost more than a whole new printer?
5,Outstanding performance for a small price,"I received this printer as a 'throw-in' when purchasing my last notebook. I wasn't expecting that much from it, just to print the ocassional letter, report, coupon, and picture. Well I was frankly blown-away by the print quality.For written material this is about as good as it gets. Strikingly crisp text, no bleeding ever, easy to read, outstanding. By far the best text I have ever seen on an inkjet printer. Pictures have good, deep colors although I prefer to have my pictures pritned out and have only printed a handful.Very easy to use. Changing cartridges is literally a snap, and fairly good cartridge life. And to top it off it is energy star rated. Also this has been a solid performer for me for some time, with zero problems ever. For my next printer I will defintely have Canon at the top of the list. Just very solid quality for an entry-level printer. They could have skimped, they did not. That says something for all their lines."
1,Waste of time & money,"Don't buy it even though it's gotten some decent reviews and only cost $49. I've owned nothing but Canon's for the past 6 years--S450, S600, & S750 and they were very good printers while they lasted. The print head eventually seems to go bad on all of them and they stop printing correctly. But this ip1800 is in a different league altogether. It's noisey, it doesn't feed paper straight, it burns through ink incredibly fast, and the print quality is not as good as the aformentioned. Don't waste your money. I just took mine out to the trash and it still worked. I didn't even want to give it to somebody."
2,Small foot print but very loud,"Seems to print fine, the PC and printer disconnected a couple of times in the middle of printing, not sure if this will continue. I loaded this on my laptop using XP OS.The paper feed sounds like a trap door opening, its very loud.The size is small, this will make a great companion to my laptop for travel.No page catcher. seems this would be and easy item to include.I like the fact that all the color ink is in 1 cartridge.I would not use the unit as my main every day printer, I think you need to spend a little more money and get a better unit."
5,Great Deal!!,This is a good printer for the money if you are on a budget like it better than my hp by far It prints fairly quick and is also a nice looking printer. I would recommend :)
1,My worst Canon purchase...,"I'vealways had good luck with Canon products, but I wish I hadn't bought this printer. It prints OK, but it's very loud and actually wobbles my (fairly sturdy) desk when printing - this has never happened before.I also object to the steep ink prices, and the fact that they run out so fast (and I mean FAST!)I have a Canon video camera, Canon digital camera, Canon scanner, and I've always had Canon printers, but I'll be shopping around for printers when I finally get irritated enough with this to buy another one - really a disappointment."
1,YUGO junk printer-light use and an early death,"I guess I should be happier based on the reviews that this printer even made it to the three year mark, but it was so lightly used, it still looks brand new. As most people have commented, it seems to use a lot of very expensive ink. Now, the paper feeder just stopped working and the printer is basically a paper weight. I work in IT and so I am used to working with HP printers many of which last 15-20 years or more.After only using this one so little over three years, it really still looks new. Its a shame, because all of the other parts on it look and seem new. But, needing a new feeder will likely cost way more than the $50 I paid for this (it came bundled with a Black Friday deal). I see you really do get what you pay for-a disposable printer that will likely fail with an early death even if barely used. For my next printer, I will invest in an HP which will usually last 3-4 times as long and cost less in ink to operate."
1,Extremely poor service from Barry Farms,"I ordered some cherries from Barry Farms ovr 2 weeks ago and they still have not shipped the product to me. Worse, they will not even answer emails to explain why. I will NEVER order from this company again."
5,Great place to order from,We received the items ordered promptly and well packaged. Great place to order from. Will do it again.
5,Short & sweet 2,"I've reviewed Travelling Troubles (Vol 3) box and my comments there largely apply here re the packaging. The only reason I bought these boxes (having already watched the Collection of DVDs)is because of the high regard I have for this program.Two figurines here would seem better value for money compared to Pacifica of Vol 3, all being the same scale. Detail quality and workmanship is high. Raquel in this scale looks 'normally' proportioned compared to the larger version in Vol 6 where her legs grow to 2/3 her height! Raquel has no moving parts; Cizs head turns and oddly, she has an alternate right arm (to lose). Both have a square plinth to stand on.Scrapped Princess deserves more than just the DVDs sitting on the shelf after watching it, this series of figurines are worthy momentos to have on display."
1,"CRAPPY, CRAPPY, CRAPPY Product ! A real Piece-Of-$#!% ~ DO NOT BUY!","I'm more lost now than I've ever was with this Piece-Of-$#i% product! This so-called navigator DOESNT KNOW ANYTHING! First of all, it doesnt give you STEP BY STEP directions. It only tells you how many miles it will take you, and around how long it will take you to get to your destination... It doesnt tell you ""LEFT or RIGHT"" as advertised on TV! I'm from NY, and when I enter Manhattan, Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn or Staten Island, it shows as an ""invalid city"" - I can't figure it out!On top of that, when you press ""full route"", you still have to enter what exit number you will be taking, what Highway you will be using, and if you are going North, South, East or West!If I knew what exit to take, or any of that, I wouldn't need a ""Navigation""!DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Buy a real GPS system if you are looking NOT to get lost!!!"
1,unsatisfactory,"Ordered on Dec 3, 2009. No contact from the seller.Waited until Dec 23, 2009 to ask seller why dvd hadnot yet been delivered. Seller cancelled order thereand then. No contact, no excuse, no reason, no apology.My grandaughter was disappointed.I sent a message asking why my order was cancelled.Still no contact, no answer."
2,Not Good for the Average Person,"This book is written strictly for those who are WELL versed in Ancient Near East Literature prior to reading the book. It is hard to comprehend certain items because of this. There is also a vast amount of Greek and it is only defined a few times, after that if you want to know what it says you have to keep looking back. For a good commentary look at The Epistle to the Romans by Douglas Moo (much easier to understand and it is a good book)."
3,Not my cuppa,"The ending was a cop out, in my opinion. You might like it, but I recommend reading the ending first."
5,Family Friendship Love Jealousy Deceit Crime and Punishment,"Short but intense novel on hardships of growing up, even later in life as an adult. Carroll's first book is one powerful account of an anti-hero, who is bullied and ignored in his childhood as a weak, unimportant character, left to envy others and hate himself. As suspected, his past catches up eventually, even in Vienna, thousands of miles away from home. The story drives its power from the honesty of its narrator, ringing so true that one thinks it is possibly relying on some real-life experience: a.k.a. first novel being biographical. Very interesting, original in its ideas on misperception and mistreatment of others and of oneself. I compare this one favorably against the critically appraised, award winning Carroll book ""Land of Laughs""."
3,It Walks by Night,"It Walks By Night. begins with a quote about night monsters that bring about thoughts of werewolves and vampires. It is, however, a murder mystery complete with a severed head. The impossible murder that could not have happened with all doors being watched. It contains all of the needed components for this type of mystery. There is the inspector, the gruesome beheading, the new bride, trickery, and the woman scorned. To top it off - a little Reefer Madness mixed in."
5,Very nice...must check out!,"intimate, up-close, superb recording of Austin's best up and coming artists."
4,Why is it that it always comes out edited first.,"I like a lot of anime japanese work, but am getting bored with the fact that they always bring it out edited first and then wait several years before they bring it out uncut.Sometimes they do bring it out uncut but it's always in japanese audio, half the time I'm so busy reading what people are saying that I don't watch what's going on in the show. Isn't it about time for them to bring it out with several audio versions."
4,episodes for this dvd,"1.the desperate duel. zolo faces of against buggys best swordsmen.2.who gets the last laugh. luffy faces buugy and we learn about some of buggys past with shanks3. the teller of tales.we meet usopp his veggie crew kiya and klahadore/kuro4. the bluff and the bluffer. we learn klahadore is kuro , luffy falls off a cliff and no one wiil belive usopp when he says klahadore is kuro.5.the war at the shore. luffys crew and usopp prepare for kuros crew to atack."
5,"Pretty unbeatable for the price, and works with linux.","I have a pair of older macs here, a 9500 and an 8500. I installed this card in both machines. The card ran in MacOS 9, after using Apple's USB updater, which is available from their support/downloads site (for free of course). I also used this card with very good success in linux (no modules or kernel recompiles necessary in fact). One drawback is the card was not recognized by Mac OS X. However, with these older machines, Linux is a much better choice anyways.Highly recommended at the price..."
5,wow..what a deal,got this awesome deal on a tape I couldn't get in the stores anymore. Now my old camcorder is still relevent... Works great! Thanks!!!
5,Essential,"I bought this record as a casette when it was originally released, then purchased it again as a CD. I'm buying it a third time, for the extended materials. I'm not a huge fan of Dumptruck, but I've never gotten tired of listening to For the Country.The record swings from pastoral, slow tunes like ""Brush me Back,"" and ""For the Country,"" to more uptempo rockers like ""Going Nowhere,"" and ""Wire."" There's not a dud on the album. Most people I've played the record for enjoy it, even if not as much as I, but I've never played ""Friends"" for anyone who didn't love it, and ""Going Nowhere"" is another perfect tune."
2,Wake We When It's Over,"It's hard to imagine anyone less suited for the video thing than former Stones bassist Bill Wyman, the first member of the band to release a solo album, the not-as-bad-as-it's-made-out-to-be ""Monkey Grip"" way back in 1974.Here he sleepwalks through a handful of songs from 1982's ""Bill Wyman"" album, the directors of each clip doing their best to make silk from a sow's ear, dressing him in a variety of 80's new wave/""Miami Vice"" togs but failing miserably to disguise the fact that he has all the charisma of of a turnip.Worth a look for those inclined to rubberneck a highway pile-up."
2,"Great service, poor product performance","The company sent the Watch Back Case Opener Knife Watchmaker Repair Tool I purchased quickly and it arrived faster than I expected. It was in excellent condition and packed securely. The price seemed reasonable. Unfortunately, it came with no instructions and I have been unable to use it successfully."
4,Stafford rediscovered is a treasure,"Jo Stafford, the GI's favorite female voice, is in her throaty glory here on this selection of hits. Especially good is a bass-laced In the Still of the Night. Also worth listening to are some tunes that are heard too rarely, The Boy Next Door and Sugar."
4,A unique and interesting addition to your prehistoric collection.,"This toy has several things going for it:1: It's a unique choice of creature. Even the most dinosaur-obsessed kids will be hard-pressed to name this guy without looking at the underside of his wing where his name is printed.2: It's a unique pose. Some people don't even know pterodactyls could rest on the ground, let alone walk. Anhanguera is depicted in a radically different pose from most pterodactyl toys.3: It's well-made. It's crafted from a high-quality material that stands up well to standard play.It's also quite small. Keep that in mind - you're not getting a big toy here. But what you do get is a special little pterodactyl that is a worthy addition to the ranks of your collection of prehistoric life."
1,not effective for me,"Sorry, but this formula was not effective for me.I used it for two weeks and did not notice any effect except for a minor burning in my stomach from the pepper extract in the formula."
4,Workers' Compensation 101,I recommend this book to all injured workers.I found the book to be informative; it covers information on workers comp I never thought about. It tells the dos and don'ts of the system and what to watch out for. It covers things like dealing with your rehab councilor to going to an IME.
4,great for a new victim of Worker's Comp system,"This is a great book for a new victim to the Worker's Compensation system. It gives us victims some insight to what is to come and shares some of the rules, that are safely guarded from us... It is a definite read for all victims to gain insight that you are not alone and to be prepared for what may be to come."
4,Never heard of this guy until I saw him on VH1,I now know he was the lead singer of the Stone Roses. I happened to see his video on VH1 from his new cd Solarized. It was a freaking great song. I went out that day to buy Solarized and love it. Its one of my favorite cds. I usally listen to classic rock to hard rock and this dude's cd blew me away. I love it. Its too bad I didnt know about him before. His music is like psychedelic 60's with a modern beat. Its awesome! cheers Ty
5,One of my favourite albums of the last 10 years,"While I certainly agree that it must surely help my assessment that I liked the Stone Roses, I think that people who at least didn't hate them should give this a listen. Like the Roses, the album builds in intensity as it progresses, but it also brings new elements, such as a well worked brass band in one track. Really excellent and varied but mostly driving rock music. Lovers of English Indie music should definitely give this one a try."
3,"if you're not a rabid fan of Stone Roses, best take a pass","This is easily Ian Brown's best solo CD, but that, sadly, isn't saying much. It seems like the sleek-sounding tracks were created by studio musicians and engineers, and then Ian Brown came into the studio and sang ""over"" the tracks. Not all of the tracks are this disappointing. Kiss Ya Lips has a nice low-key groove and a couple of the other tracks will hold your attention for a few listens. But you'll quickly forget this music. Its odd how much of this CD sounds like Massive Attack...."
2,A good general reference but does not shine in any one area.,"I confess to not being a fan of books that lead you through a scenario based on a ficticious network design and this book does just that. If you like that sort of thing, this book is for you.The parts that do not conform to that model give some good information on deployment, troublehsooting and administration but is light on the details, especially in the client area. It is an easy read and will give you the basics.Better to purchase ""Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5, Planning, Design and Impementation by Tony Redmond. Study hard, pass the exam, then by Tony's book. Makes you feel like an Exchange Server Champ!"
3,Vague Coverage in Many Areas,"I have hard trouble finding comprehensive or exacting information in any one area. I wanted to understand Permissions tab under Recipient properties, but there was so little coverage of recipient properties. I wanted to figure out about DNS usage of Exchange 5.5, but I only found a smattering of pages on DNS concepts, but no actual how to do this in that area.I think overall, it's hit and miss. Some non-mainstream topic areas are covered well, while basic fundamentals has inadequate or precise coverage.I like the Dune references for the sample organization, sites, and servers. Really nice. :-)"
2,Hard to read,If you need a first primer to Exchange Server I recommend MS Exchange Server Core Technologies by Ed Paulson - much more insightful.
1,Just doesn't cut it.,The fact that this book has so little info on the client end of exchange makes this book a waste. There are many other books in print that cover the client as well as server side.
3,Item as described.,"Not as accurate as expected. After 6-9 months of use, wheel bearing is wearing out. Not as accurate as expected. After 6-9 months of use, wheel bearing is wearing out."
4,Great Product - Wish it was taller,"Great product. I am 6'2"" so I wish the handle was just a bit longer but I do enjoy how small it is when retracted. Light and easy to use."
4,measuring wheel,"This item is very good. It is very easy to use and collapses to an easy carry. I would reccomend this to anyone who needs to measure lots, buildings or walls."
3,Good value,"I purchased this product based on price and the fact it is lightweight. I like that it is very light and telescopes to a compact size because I have to travel with it. This is my first measuring wheel. After using it, I wish I had chosen the model with 2 wheels for better stability at about the same price."
4,*dallas girl*,"I purchased this book because I am an author as well, the only difference is that I write novels. This book will assist me in naming characters for my future novels. I found it to be quite interesting. It's a great buy for anyone who is in need of names!"
4,Plain White Envelopes,"There does not seem to be a great deal one can say about a plain white envelope. They arrived in perfect condition, look good and do their job; what more can one say about a plain white envelope?The box they came in is sturdy enough to withstand the rigors of storage and should protect the unused envelopes until they are used. Moisture must be applied for sealing but there are many simple ways to deal with that; I don't see that as a problem.I think they represent a good value and will probably order them again when we run out."
3,Wrong thing,"I wanted #9 envelopes which is what it said they were. When I recieved them, they were #10 envelopes. Which I will be able to use eventually, but not what I ordered."
5,Richard did it again,"Great music and great melodies, impossible you don't love it. Richard Davies is one of the most underrated composers of the 90's and this album is another proof more of it. Enjoy it!Gran música y grandes melodías, es imposible que no ames este disco. Richard Davies es uno de los compositores más subestimados de los 90 y este álbum es otra prueba más de ello. ¡Disfrútalo!"
4,wonderfully restrained melodicism,"at first i was disappointed with this record, but it's definitely one that creeped up on me when i wasn't expecting it. davies' way with a melody is so subtle sometimes that you don't even realise he's done anything special, but he gets maximum impact from the slightest little change in structure or melody. it sounds academic in print, but it sounds great!"
1,Didn't Like It,"When i bought this i thought ""cool a dvd that will help me play the guitar"" but.......... It didn't. In the dvd it teaches you 3 chords. I think this is a total waste of money. Sure. It may teach you to tune the guitar or how to hold it or the picking technique. But if your looking for a dvd that will ACTUALLY help you play better, look for something else. you know what they say... You get what You pay for. So spend a little more and get something else a little better."
1,Not what I was Expecting,...mediocre and best and the music was not at all what I thought it would sound like. I would have purchased something else
3,depends on what you want to use it for,"this is for light at-home use only. not to be used as a mechanics little cheat tool. i found out the hard way and nearly damaged it. unfortunately, i just plain decided to throw it out because i have tools, i don't actually need this thing, it was kinda a hit or miss anyway. the torque spec is false, you'll damage your product if you try to do any serious work with this. i'm very bummed and disappointed. oh well. remember, light duty only!"
5,"Suprisingly (to me), this has turned out to be a great, handy tool","I first bought a Gator Grip in desperation to remove a partially stripped bolt in a hard-to-reach area, and it worked like a charm. Since then, I have found myself using it frequently around the house, most recently to remove a plastic wing nut with broken wings, located where pliers could not reach.Until I bought one, I thought it was a gimmicky gadget, but as somebody who spends most weekends doing home improvement, maintenance, and repairs, I can say that it has turned out to be a great purchase."
2,Didn't work as described.,This guy looks like a good product in the info-mercials...but it rounded off two bolts I was trying to remove. Oh well.
5,THIS IS THE DEFINITIVE DEATH OF OVERWEIGTH!,Forever! For good !It teached me how to control my worst enemy:My subconscious mind asking for FOOD! FOOD !You will not find any diet on this book: JUST THE MAGIC WAND NOT TO EVER AGAIN BE OVERWEIGHT !
5,LA UNICA SOLUCION,"te la da esta maravilla.El que te hace comer de más, es tuy subconsciente: Simplemente, te enseña a manejarlo a la PÉRFECCIÓN.NO vuelves a subir de peso. Tu mismo eliges la dieta que quieras. Este libro SÓLO ES PARA CONTROLAR TU MENTE MIENTRAS BAJAS DE PESO Y DESPUÉS QUE HAS BAJADO, PARA NO OERMITIRTE SUBIR DE NUEVO !"
4,Great layout tool.,"We are timber frame company and use this tool to layout a sub-floor and mark post locations.Works great, one person can do the job and if the floors wet your are not fighting with chalk lines."
4,Stanley 77-154 SP5 fat max lazer kit,This product was as described. I thought it would provide and line instead of a dot. Completely my misunderstanding. Overall this is a great product for the price and would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a quality laser at a resonable price.
3,One is Perfect..the other did not work1,"We just bought two of them, unfortunately one of them never Turned On, and as we live outside US in latin america it is veryyyy expensive to send it back to amazon to get a refund ...so we are happy with the one that worked ...but very dissapointed with the damaged one."
4,Works Great!!!,"This little thing is just great for bulding an elevated deck. The only complaint I have is that they recessed the threaded hole for mounting on a tripod too far for the screw on the tripod to reach. Had to use zip ties to hold it on. But, that is my only complaint."
4,"This is a ""dot"" laser level, not a ""line"" laser level.","This laser level projects five laser beam dots that define three lines in a dimensional axis, with the laser level itself at the center of this axis. The first line is straight up and down, the second line straight left to right across the horizon, and the third line is orthogonal to the second line. Keep in mind, however, that these axis are visible only as laser dots! This laser level does not project any visible laser lines, so it is next to useless for things like marking straight lines on existing horizontal or vertical surfaces. (ie, hanging pictures.) The laser level is simply to bulky to be placed against surfaces for the purpose of determining if they are level; the projected laser dot is about 4"" away from everything. I suppose you could adjust for that with by taking a bunch of measurements with a ruler, etc., but that wasn't what I had in mind when I bought it."
2,Limited capability,Stanley tools are normally a good value and useful. This unit does not have the ability to broadcast a line and is therefor less useful than others I have seen.I will keep it on-hand but would recommend that anyone looking for a new device opt to spend a little more for better utility.
3,Five Beam Laser,"Initially, I was disappointed. The product was advertised as new but when I unpacked the box it was apparent the display box was not new as it was faded and showed that it had been opened before. Once unpacked, I noticed there were batteries already installed in the laser. I'm not aware of any ""new"" product that ships from the manufacturer with the batteries installed. And then when I turned the laser on it did not work. Upon closer inspection I found the batteries were installed wrong. The factory would have installed batteries incorrectly in a ""new"" product? Once I re-installed the batteries the laser was ready to work. Overall, I like my new laser. It takes all the guess work out of my project layout. I guess my only disappointment is that the laser was not as advertised, ""new."" If it had said ""used"" in the description, I would have been OK with that, I needed a laser and was satisfied with the price. But it was advertised as ""new"" and it obviously was not."
3,Too Short but good choice of cars.,"This video is way too short. Play time is only 44 minutes for 10 cars. Thats just over 4 minutes per car. It should have been at least 60 minutes and quite frankly 90 minutes would have been even better. On the positive side, the 10 cars they picked were pretty good. The cars are: Ferrari F-40, Testarossa, Lamborghini Countach, Acura NSX, Shelby Cobra, Porsche 911 turbo, Ford GT-40, BMW M1, Lotus Esprit turbo, and Corvette ZR-1. Another thing that I didn't like was the interview of the owners of these cars. We watch this video for one thing: the cars! I honestly don't care what the owners have to say. And with such a short video, that's just leave less time for each car. Also, keep in mind that this video was made in 1992 so don't expect to see the Viper, F-50, or Diablo."
1,Not sturdy enough for toddlers,"The idea is a good one, but the very first thing my toddler did was rip the frog off the page. Also, it's not board book, and it doesn't have regular paper pages, it's something in between. More like oak tag folded over to create stiff pages. Pat the Bunny is the only one of this series that I would recommend."
1,"Too wordy, not as fun as Pat the Bunny","My 7.5 month old loves Pat the Bunny - the words are simple enough that he understands their meaning ""now YOU pat the bunny"" etc. He can do every activity. This book is too wordy, and the activiites are way too hard. All the wants to do is rip the flimsy frog from the page."
3,"""USED""","Was very disappointed when received it. I know it was ""used"" but there were parts torn in the book. Will not buy a used one again!"
5,Wow,"It Doesen't matter if you are into Metal, Hip-hop, Pop, Polka... This goes beyond all that. If you are a fan of music, you owe it to yourself to listen to this cd. You wont regret it.BUY IT!"
4,Take a trip without leaving the farm,"Whatever is in the water that the Elephant Sixers have been drinking, spoon me out a dollop! Dusk at Cubist Castle is great on many levels. A song can remind you of an old sixties pop tune and Galaxie 500 in the same moment, then take you through a transistor radio into an alternate universe during the bridge. I had to let this record grow on me for months--you really do miss a lot on the first auditions. I agree that tracks 11-21 are overwrought ""avant-garde"" noise and that they could have cut some, but at the same time, the tracks are in keeping with the peak of a psychedelic experience, or the crisis points in any journey. So, structurally, the placement works. The noise really works perfectly for the beginning of the title track, for example. O.T.C. is very very good at crafting pop tunes that you feel you've heard before in a dream. Brilliant record."
5,Gazorninplat,"Volume 3 Disc 3 is my favorite of the whole series. It contains the episode Learning Lessons, in which Garfield makes up the word Gazorninplat in an effort to get the buddy bears to stop interrupting him with educational facts. I couldn't remember the name of the episode or what season it was in so it took a while to come across it again. Once I did my daughter wanted to watch it about 3 times in a row.I agree with some of the other reviews in that the discs are pretty no-frills, and the name change for US Acres seemed odd, but I can't really deduct a star from a very entertaining series just for that."
3,"Okay, but it skratches!","If you like good sturdy cases, buy it. however, it scratches your cd's, and i don't like that."
1,Not Worth Reading,"I have read four other trial books from the Maut and Nita Series. At times this text is hard to understand and follow. The author emphasizes how lawyers should not speak or act like lawyers in the court room. Maybe the author should have followed his own advice in writing this text.If you like to open up the dictionary to expand your vocabulary, this is the text for you. The author loves to try to impress the reader with his exspansive vocabluary.Not my reccomendation. Maut and Nita series are the best."
2,Only if you can sew...,"While this book does have a few pictures, they seem quite old. The one or two items I liked didn't have any instructions for. If you are not a sewer, than this book is not for you. I found the book very confusing - definitely written for the person with sewing background. Sorry."
3,Okay but limited,This book is okay but limited in window ideas. I was looking for formal swags and jabots and it didn't have any.
4,Look through my window,"If you've got a nice, sunshiny yard, why not gussy it up a little with one of the contemporary curtain ensembles that decorators now call, window treatments? I found Creative Publishing's guide to be insightful and a true resource, it's good even with the basement windows that my X put inwhile trying to give a basement woodshop some natural light, but on the other hand nosy neighbors mean that you have to have some cloth over the glass.Whether your view overlooks a garden in the country, or St. Patrick;s Cathedral in the city, you'll want a book like this here ""More Creative Window Treatments"" so you can look at the color photos and decide for yourself, and for your family, which setting would look nicest. And then the book gives you complete instructions for how to sew it together yourself. Or perhaps you can enlist the assistance of the birds and mice Disney's Cinderella used to help her whip together her gown!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS ITEM - WORLDGATE WENT OUT OF BUSINESS,"Worldgate went out of business, so if you buy the phone, you can't use it without the monthly service."
1,Is This about justice,"I have not read the book but wonder about the author who has such a desregard for public safety, public order of the role of the police to protect us from violence. His behaviour during the Gustafsen Lake occupation revealed someone on the edge and held him up to widespread public ridicule."
5,should appeal to ----,"conceptual work combining manmade and natural found sounds with conventional music,if this project was just a experiment I hope that the artist was keeping notes,we need more !!"
3,Foley Room,"This album is flush with hits and misses, being that there are more misses than hits is why I give this album 3 stars. I have listened to this album about 10 times or so, and at face value many of the tracks that fall into the misses category are provocative/interesting, though they fail to really create a listening experience I want to come back to. However the tracks that do hit the mark are fantastic.Hands down the best tracks on the album...At The End Of The DayAlwaysEver FallingThe Killer's Vanilla"
4,A little disapointed,"There is certainly some great new material on this album, but I cannot listen to this whole CD. Every previous Tobin album I could listen to start to finish, but this one drags in the middle. I just don't care for Horsefish or Kitchen Sink, maybe its just too minimal for my tastes. The middle 4 songs are just not as exciting as previous works or the rest of the CD. Still worth owning for fans."
4,The Hold-All For You Trunk,"When I first got this in the mail, I thought that it was rather large, but it fit so nicely in the back of my SUV. I have mine set up vertically against the driver's side of the car and still have lots of room on the passenger side of the trunk to hold other things when I need to. I love the outside mesh pockets, which are great for holding small items. I also love that this thing can zip up with everything inside rather than leaving it open, but leaving it open is great when you are holding bulkier or tall items. I don't think that I am ever going to run out of room with this organizer as it is very spacious.There are two cons though: 1) the velcro on the bottom doesn't really grasp the carpet in the back of my SUV. It may just be my carpet (my car is less than 6 months old); however, I have enough stuff inside that it doesn't slide around. 2) There are no internal dividers, which would be nice instead of just one large open space."
4,Christmas Gift For Friend,I purchased this trunk organizer as a Christmas gift for a friend to use in his 2004 Ford f150. My friend seems to really like his organizer and is happy with it as a substitute for a similar unit that I use in my 2010 Ford F150. I personally like my unknown brand organizer because mine has two dividers that separate the cargo organizer into three bins for storage. Both units fold easily to be put away behind or under the rear seat in an extended cab pickup. My friend likes that his organizer has a zippered cover while my unit does not have that feature.
4,Cargo Organizer,"This item arrived very quickly in the mail, and it holds a lot of items. I am very satisfied with the quality of this product."
3,Its allright!!,"I was expecting something better out of this product!It doesnt really holds up when its empty, even when we have stuff in the case the sides still fall in. and it does not stick to our cars carpeting!"
3,Good Value for the Money,Light and easy to push out of the way. Perfect for putting grocery bags in so they won't roll all over the trunk space.
1,Overpriced POS,"It sucks, I ended up giving mine away and buying some way better ones i found for 9.99 at the container store. This is difficult to fold and doesn't even stay up on its own."
