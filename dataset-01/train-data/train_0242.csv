4,Profound and Personal,"Hillman, like Karl Jung before him, takes a fearless journey into his own psyche exploring the personal, psychological and social implications of old age and impending death. An important work for people of all ages."
5,"An experience worth reading over--...and over, and over!","I checked this book out at the local library in hopes of a good read. I wasn't disappointed!! Right in the beginning I bonded with the chracters since they were around my age of 13. The worlds they lived in were so different yet they were dealing with the same kind of problem--growing up and dealing with the demands and changes that came along with it. Hezhi-she had to deal with the power her ancient father, the River, had given her-and how to escape it. Perkar-he had deal with the rituals of becoming a man and gaining Piraku-until meeting a goddess so beautiful he vowed to slay the one thing that could result in his death. Their lives twist and turn until their destinys become so entangled that they are forever bonded. Finishing this book will leave your mind with thousands of possible endings to the sequel, The Blackgod. My advice, if you plan to buy The Waterborn, buy The Blackgod at the same time!"
4,The Waterborn,"There are many fantasy books out there to read. So, it's refreshing to find something that's not the typical take-off of D&D game play. Given the chance to get used to J. Gregory Keyes style of writing, the story sucks you in and you find yourself identifying with the main characters, as it should be. At the end of the story you are left wanting more, which I am sure is what the author wanted. The only dissappointment I find is in waiting for the next volume of the series to come out in paperback."
1,If you don't have anything nice to say...,"I'm going to try and adhere to the adage, 'If you don't have anything nice to say...""So I'll limit myself to a couple of brief non-inflammatory comments.- If you're postmenopausal and have a desire to see half-baked sword fights and wizened chicks kicking men's backsides, then then is your flick.- Sort of wished they threw in a monster or two, just to spice things up. And then it could be loosely thrown into the 'fantasy' category. Because as it is... it's just sad.Heartbreaking to see one of my favorite actors, Rutger Hauer, involved this production. So I like to think he did something nice with the paycheck - took a long vacation to the Bahamas or helped pay down his mortgage."
1,Terrible,"This is worth nobody's time unless you are going for your 10-year old's end of the year movie party in school. Casting rating is horrible, story terrible, acting 0%."
4,Puppet,"Of Joy Fielding's recent books, this was way better than Lost-no question. Loaded with suspense, twists and turns! The main character was a little shallow, and not very likable."
4,Enjoyed the mother-daughter tangle,"I enjoyed the mystery, but I also enjoyed the static of the mother-daughter friction that was an interesting undercurrent of the story. Though Amanda may seem cold and in a sense, uncaring and rebellious toward the first half of the book, I was intrigued by the way Fielding gradually ""warmed"" up Amanda's personality by unveiling things from her past that explains where she's coming from and why she is the way she is, to a certain degree. As I got to know more about Amanda and her relationship with her mother, Amanda's behavior becomes more understandable to me and curiosity is aroused as to why certain things happened the way they did and why certain people behaved the way they did. The mother-daughter tangle adds well to the story. The conclusion is satisfying and twists an initially cold character into a warm-blooded human being with a wide array of feelings."
2,ugh!,"O.k., there was nothing to like about the main character in this book. She was irritating, stuck on herself, had no morals, foul-mouthed and drank a lot. There wasn't much of a story either and they drag you along for the entire book only to find out in the end what the murder is really based on. I felt it was a big let down."
5,Couldn't put it down,I loved this book. I haven't read Fielding in quite sometime. This book reminded why I liked her in the first place. I read this in 3 days and turned it over to my mother who read it in 2 days.
2,Cliches and drama queens,"This was my first novel by Ms. Fielding. Quite a disappointment, sorry to say. The protagonist inspires no empathy. I agree with other reviewers that a novel needn't have a saint or role model as the main character, but Amanda is just whiny, self-absorbed and rude. I lost count, too, of how many times she ""whispered into her coat collar"" or spoke out loud ""without realizing it.""I can't recommend this book as there are so many well-written thrillers/courtroom dramas/mysteries to choose from. Pet peeve: the references to anti-depressants as ""psychosis inducing"" and a ""nightmare world"" really irked me. I work in mental health and I hate to see the many beneficial meds lumped in with ""suicide pills"". A little research would have helped!"
2,Very Disappointed,"I just started reading Fielding (A friend recommeded her to me, since I am a big Deaver, Patterson, Hoag & Kellerman fan) but Puppet was very disappointing. The ending was a little far-fetched and I expected more realism. I preferred Missing Pieces over this AND Whispers and Lies."
3,Gross Ending,"This is the first Joy Fielding book I have ""read"" (it was an audio book, unabridged). Like many of the other reviewers, I found Amanda to be very unsympathetic. I found myself telling her not to be so stupid several times and to get over it. Some reviewers complained about other characters being two-dimensional. Since the whole book was written from Amanda's viewpoint, although not in a first person narrative, it would be difficult for other characters to be more than two-dimensional. Amanda is written as a very self-centered person. But, the ending...ugh. One reader called it creepy. I call it downright gross and disgusting. I cannot conceive how somebody could do that and do it for 22 years. At the very least, Fielding could have had Gwen make one more stunning announcement about John's relationship to Haley. I think the story would not have left such an unpleasant odor(?) at the end."
3,Puppet,"I was disappointed in this long-awaited book. Joy Fielding is usually great with her books, but this obviously was a different style of writing for her. The storyline was average and predictable."
1,Absolutely hated this book.,"Nothing about this book was appealing to me...not the style of writing, which was fractured at best and tedious at worst, certainly not the characters who got lost in their flaws and the jerky movement of sequences, and the ending was just plain disgusting, not to mention unbelievable. I know you have to suspend your disbelief for much fiction to be enjoyable, but my disbelief just won't stretch that far!"
2,Puppet,"Although a good novel, it was not as spell binding as her previous. I enjoyed the book, but by no means was it a ""can't put down,page turner""."
4,Psychological Thriller,"If you can get past the slow start and disagreeable heroine, this is a pretty good read. Once the pace picks up, the story moves along very nicely. The author throws in some interesting twists that will probably surprise most readers; I found some of them to be a bit of a stretch, but suspending disbelief isn't too difficult.All in all, a good read."
3,Her other books are better,"I agree, this book dragged on way too long. The 'surprise ending' was a real shocker. The fact that I made it to the end is a tribute to Joy Fielding - even not at her best she is still better than most."
4,Keeps you guessing,Puppet is a fast-paced read with twists to the plot. Just sit back and prepare for just about anything.
5,Our Love Is Here To Stay,"Joe Williams and Count Basie were one of the best vocalist/big band combinations ever. There is something about Williams's smooth baritone and the bright sound of the postwar Basie band that sends the music straight to the brain's pleasure center. This album has each artist at his best. Like many of the reviewers here, I've been listening to this recording since I picked it up on vinyl--in my case, over twenty-five years ago. The album starts out with a bang with ""Thou Swell,"" and never lets up. My favorite: ""Our Love Is Here To Stay,"" which may be one of the most beautiful things ever recorded.Since this is an album of vocal standards, after all, it's probably more of a Joe Williams record than a Count Basie one, but the band is a real presence on all the songs, and this disc belongs in any Basie fan's collection."
1,so confusing,"I don't not normally write bad reviews, But this game is just so confusing. When you tame your horse in the second level the bar goes down fast that says you had tamed it and its almost impossible to get back up. Also in the second level you don't know where to go or what to do next and the booklet to help you doesn't tell you anything."
1,spirit review,I thought it was wrather boring it was a easy to beat and had no point! It takes maybe an hour to beat but probably less. It's easy to loose intreast in it. It's porley done. You feed the horse its favorite food and ride through boring levels and collect things for other animals so you can get past them. Personly it stunk!!!!!!!!!
1,"Very buggy, downright cruel!","I wonder if someone over at DreamWorks doesn't really like kids. Why else would they release a game that is buggy? From the outset, we couldn't get the horse to move. We tried everything. Eventually the kids wandered away. As did most of the adults. But determined, I kept trying. After rebooting for the 4th time, the horse FINALLY began to move. HEY, I'M NOT YOUR TESTING DEPARTMENT! I PAID YOU, NOT THE OTHER WAY ROUND!!Then once we were in the game, there were many other issues. So disappointing. And why is ther no help button? Or any help in the instruction book?Nope, I don't think they like or understand children over at DreamWorks. I'm going to avoid all there products in the future."
4,This game is great for all Spirit lovers.,This is a great game. It may be easy to beat at some points but it's still fun. All Spirit (and horse lovers) should try this game!!
2,SOOO EASY!,spirit is a fun game but after finishing it about 10 times it got pretty boring. This game is just too easy! I have beaten it over 5 times in one day. The movie is great but they should make a more challenging game.
5,WONDERFUL FORK,"Do not left the low price fool you. This is a high-end fork at a bargain basement price. I am so happy that I bought it. It is nice and heavy. Clearly up to the task of lifting heavy meats from the roasting pan to the carving board. No way will this fork ever bend. It is solid, feels great in the hand, and it's the only one you'll ever need. Very happy with this purchase!!"
4,moths of the limberlost,"HelloI have already emailed the bookstore I purchased this book from to inform them that the book arrived in fairly good time but had some damage to the top right corner that went into the book cover about 1 1/2"", and that 25 pages of the book had been affected. It was put into an envelope that was a tight fit. A larger padded envelope should have been used. This book was listed as being brand new.The bookstore emailed me back thanking me for the info.Lori Moss"
4,Three Stars Plus Nostalgia Equals:,"This probably isn't actually good music, but I am shamelessly fond of it.The 12"" mix of ""Don't Leave Me This Way"" is one of the all-time great dance tracks.If you were drinking at a college bar in the mid-to-late 80's, you know what I am saying. After the A-Ha, but before ""Paradise by the Dashboard Lights,"" and sometime around ""I Melt With You,"" this was the time/song of the evening that you were finally drunk enough to start dancing to.The rest of this album is just fine...but who cares?"
2,For Retro Fans Only,"With their screeched falsetto singing and synth based disco beats, it's obvious where the Communards roots lay. They are eighties dance pop mavins from the gay pick up scene (think Pet Shop Boys or Bronski Beat), not surprisingly, there music has not aged well. Those nostalgic for the time may enjoy them, but their dated boogie will win no converts, at least not until 80's retro really comes into it's own."
3,Good for college paper,It was a class requierement. It was in great condition and I really like the service.
3,A Slow but Promising Start,"A young priest named Silk is enlightened by a god known only as the Outsider, who burdens him with the task of saving his church from demolition.Nightside takes place over a mere two days, which inflicts on it a snail's pace and the feeling of floundering in too many details. The act of breaking into someone's mansion took more than half the book. Rituals were described in full, beginning to end. Yes, this book is a set-up for greater things to come, but still suffers from its pace, and probably could have been condensed to half its size. It was also filled with great characters, enigmatic events, bizarre creatures, and ""gods"" that might not be all they're cracked up to be. I look forward to the remainder of the series."
2,Packaging is unexpected,I ordered these pencils for a Christmas gift for my 9 year old son who LOVES to draw. The packaging is NOT even close to what is pictured. Wanted a reasonably priced set of pencils that let him know how supportive we are of his love of drawing...this package says your pencils were an after thought. Hopeing that the pencils themselves are as nice as what other reviewers have stated.
2,Product different from that Pictured,"I paid extra for this product because I thought it had a wooden case, I should have read reviews. Pencils are fine but the clear plastic case broke the moment it was opened. I could have paid less and recieved the same product. The decribtion clearly says wooden case not cheap plastic case you will have to throw away after opening. Even picture shows different case. I should have read reviews."
2,Disappointed,I am very disappointed with the product I received since it is different than what was pictured. The pencils came in a clear plastic case that will crack very easily. I will be returning these.
5,Great colors!,"I was exposed to Prismacolors pencils as a child. I have not used them in a long time as an adult. The Scholar set was perfect for me. It contains all the colors I need to color Sacred Geometric figures. I took a class on Sacred Geometry a while back and I was advised by my instructor to get some Prismacolor Pencil because of their vivid colors.Those pencils are not easy to get at a local art store. I had to search and buy then online.I got a smaller set at a barging price before, but I was taking by the seller. He/she just mixed and match perhaps what she/he wanted to get rid of.I really enjoy my Prismcolor Scholar Pencils!Ami"
1,Do not buy these pencils,"Got these pencils earlier this week. Used them once, but they kept breaking. Every time I would sharpen them, the lead would simply break. One pencil even split in half as soon as I layed it down on the paper. Got fed up and layed them down, promising to write this review later so others wouldn't make the same mistake. These are terrible quality and it's a shame Prismacolor would even sell these. I feel I got ripped off."
5,Nice colors,I simply love the colors. This is a great company and people who use them already know the quality is great.
3,Color is a little light,"The pencils are sturdy and pretty, but the color comes out a little light for my taste."
4,Good reading,"I read this book twice. Not too many books have I read more than once! The first time I read it as purely a fictional adventure. The second time I read it with an eye to the deeper subject of faith.As purely fiction, it is a fast-paced novel. It is historically feasible, but I don't know how accurate it is.When you read it and touch on the issues of faith does this book start to shine. I am in some doubt about some of the authors theology, but he has a firm grasp on the Christian faith. He presents the major character going thru what many people struggle with prior to their rebirth in Christ (I speak as a born-again Christian). How can a God who calls Himself love allow such seemingly needless suffering?Read the book and find out :)"
4,Not a true story!,"Okay, I've already reveiwed this book, but I need to inform ddhouser from Columbus that this isn't a true story. I read an interveiw with Lawhead in which he said that although there really is a Saint Aidan, this is not him! Aidan Mac Cainnech is an entirely fictitious character."
5,Byzatium and hard faith,"Byzantium is an excellent story of a man of faith who loses his faith through test after test. Aidan blames God for the hardships he has to face. Sound depressing? The novel has an awesome ending that will encourage any person to persevere whatever struggle that may come. You see, in the end... just kidding! It's a long book but it never let's you down. If you get mad (like I did) while reading the first half, good! That reaction will make the superb ending all the better. We can all associate with the main character. But enough of my babbling, just read it!"
2,Nothing Too Thrilling About This One,"Stephen Lawhead has hit a flat note with ""Byzantium."" The details as always are vivid; however, the plot is slow and lackluster. The characters are also dull and predictable. The novel was still a great idea, and all in all, not a bad fantasy/adventure. But just too tedious, deliberate, and contrived."
2,Over-long and unbelievable,"The story told in ""Byzantium"" is perhaps the stuff of a TV miniseries, but as a novel it is over-long (at 872 pages!), far-fetched and unbelievable, and in the end, not very gratifying. The prose is pedestrian and pedantic, and the author's attempts at descriptive language often go astray. For example, between pages 682 and 703, the main character, Aidan, has his stomach""squirm"", has something someone said ""squirm"" in his head, and has his mind ""squirm"". It would appear that poor Aidan, and the poor reader, are in trouble. The novel has Aidan travelling through so many lands and so many adventures, the tale becomes a laundry list of ""what else can I have him do now?"" rather than a coherent narative. The novel also does injustice to the real, historical St. Aidan who became Bishop of Lindisfarne in 635. St. Aidan predated the Book of Kells (c. late seventh, early eighth century) and was never engaged to an Arab princess!!"
1,Another fantasy novel limited by its author,"I used to like fantasy novels, but now I'm beginning to realize how flat and uninspired many are. Byzantium is no exception. Perhaps with a better author, it could have been made into something. As it is however, Byzantium wears out anyone with a curious, discerning mind. Stephen R. Lawhead appears to have hit a glass ceiling with his character descriptions: try as he might, they never become real, flesh and blood individuals. Instead they, and the world they travel through, remain two-dimensional and uninvolving. The writing style is inconsistent, and the ending was not well thought through; the author simply does not have the writing prowess to lift his novels to a higher level. Byzantium is a readily forgotten, slow read, indistinguishable from the multitudes of cheap, unbelievable fantasy novels."
3,"A good read, but a bit jerky at times","You've gotta love those Vikings, eh? Lawhead takes us through some of the most fascinating places of a fascinating time and there are long stretches that flow with intrigue/fun/adventure/whatever. However, when he needs to make a developmental step forward, the story leaps or ""jerks"" onto a whole new premise. Things start to get a bit sluggish, then WHAM! something happens or someone's attitude changes inexplicably. The central tangle, Aidan's faith and sudden bitterness towards God, took me by surprise, and not pleasantly. I was perplexed as to his sudden change of heart with subsequent bile, and this was never explained... I enjoyed the places Lawhead took me, but he needed to work more on the transitions, not to mention the ending. Most of them seemed too-sudden."
5,wonderful read,"I found this book a little slow to start. Than once it got going, could not put it down. Great insight into Islam.I could relate to the main character.I gave it to a friend to read."
5,Great Historical Fiction!,"I thoroughly enjoyed Byzantium. I found myself going online afterwards to see pictures and look at the history. I especially enjoyed when the character was with the Arabs, since I am now living and working in Saudi Arabia!The book started out a bit slow, but after a fourth of the way into it, I couldn't put it down! A great read, especially for Christians who have found themselves in the same state of mind as Aiden; that God has turned away from them. What a re-affirmation of faith! I found myself saying, no, you're wrong!I highly recommend this book!"
3,Verisimilitude but Plot-driven,"Byzantium plunged the reader into a very realistic, adventure-filled Europe. This is for the modern-day novel lover. I couldn't get into even though I love medieval and fantasy stuff (that's why I picked this book up). I am spoiled from the classics. Aidan was an round character, but not profound enough to carry us through 800 pages. The plot drove me crazy; I couldn't help but slug through his detour as a captive of a scandanavian viking. It is a great tour de Europe in the middle ages, but if your looking for profound reading, looke to the classics. Lawhead is a great writer though."
2,HUH?,"Okay, I've read Stephen Lawhead's books before. I've liked them, even. That's why I got Byzantium. While reading it, I thought it was pretty good, if somewhat slow. As I neared the ending, I was wondering, ""How is he going to finish this up? There's not enough room!"" I was right. The book wasn't too bad, but it seems Lawhead realized his deadline was the next day and just threw something down to finish it at eleven that night."
2,Not very useful...,"I bought this for taking the ""good jewelry"" with me when I travel, but it really lacks usable features. I found it too small to be practical.The ring bar is so skinny that your rings end up rubbing together. It does have a couple of small pockets in which you could put rings or small earrings, and two medium-sized zipper pockets that might hold a bracelet or small watch.If you really want to take your good stuff with you, look elsewhere. If you just want to bring a spare ring and a pair of earrings for a weekend, this would be okay."
4,No Turntables. Hurray!!,"Finally there is a band who has strayed away from the stereotypical vogue of nu-metal. Puddle of Mudd are an exciting new band with a singer who is a mix between Scott Weiland and Kurt Cobain, follow this up with catchy songs as well as heavy crunching guitars and this album is a very respectable effort.There is also a nice range of songs from the rockier tracks like ""Control"", and ""Nobody Told Me"" to the acoustic ballads of ""Drift and Die"" to the poppy ""She Hates Me""(this song reminds me of Lithium"".Get this album it is definately worth getting."
5,This cd rocks,"When Puddle of Mudd released their first single ""Control"" I totally blew the song off as another rock wannabe group since I will not listen to ""alternative rock"" groups unless they throw something unique to the table or do a throw-back to the ""old school"" days of rock and roll. This cd filled both of those catagories. After ""Blurry"" was released I was hooked. I rushed out to the store and immediately bought the cd. When I got home, I kicked myself for not buying this cd sooner. The best songs on this cd in my opinion are : ""Control"", ""Drift & Die"", ""Blurry"", and ""She Hates Me"". ""Control"" is a perfect example of ""old school"" and ""alternative rock"" blending together. ""Drift & Die"" is a throw-back to the old school days for sure. Same with ""Blurry"". ""She Hates Me"" is just a great song to kick back and laugh. I mean, how many versus can a person have on how many times he got [...] in a relationship. But the song is funny and could become a hit if it would ever get radio time."
1,"Straight out of ""How to Exploit Trends""","Aagh! More simpleton rock. Completely unoriginal riffs, poor instrumentation, and stupid-arse lyrics make up the grung wannabes of Puddle of Mudd, the most accurate band name around. It's sad that rip-offs like these guys, Nickelback, Creed, and others get all the attention while other grunge-influenced, yet far more imaginative, original bands like Local H and modern Days of the New (Travis Meeks is a musical genius) are given the shaft. POM's lyrics are nowhere near as poetic as Kurt Cobain's, Eddie Vedder's, Layne Staley's (God rest his soul), and Chris Cornell's lyrics, nor is the instrumentation anywhere near such bands either. These guys will be nowhere five years from now. They're an example of all that's wrong with modern rock. Boooooooo!!!!"
4,So They Sound Like A Grunge Band. Who cares?!?,"I just saw Puddle of Mudd play here in San Francisco. They were very tight. Powerful, edgy, yet melodic. Like the best grunge bands were. So what if they sound like a grunge band. That's a heck (...) of a lot better than sounding like another boy band or Britney Spears wannabe. Every song on Come Clean is a good to excellent song. That's more than you can say about most of the rock bands out there right now. Wesley's got about the edgiest sounding voice, since Kurt Cobain. And this comparison with Eddie Vedder doesn't make sense to me. Definitely closer to Cobain than Vedder. Anyway, great band, great album, they sound like grunge, and have a great singer. Buy the album and then check these guys out live, before they get really big and start playing the arenas. If their next album is even better than this one, that's where they'll be playing."
2,so much potential...so much screaming,"when i first heard Control by Puddle of Mudd, i thought...""this is [junk]...but very good [junk]""...and indeed it was. i got this cd Christmas 2001, and played it on my cd player constantly. but now, due to my polishing of my music tastes and PoM's over-exposure, i sold it to my friend...the only good songs on there were Control and Nobody Told Me (i'll admit it, it's an eerie echo of Kurt Cobain...). I never liked She F****** Hates Me or Drift and Die, nor Blurry, so when they became MTV staples, my enchantment with Wes and PoM was lost. But those two songs i liked (control & Nobody Told Me) were amazing with fantastic drum hooks by Greg Upchurch and guitar riffs by Wes. i do hope their sophomore effort fares better, because those songs had so much to offer, but the rest of the album was, to put it frankly, [junk.]."
2,Not the best....,"I don't think this is the best CD ever. I listened to it for maybe two weeks and then put it away and only listened to it once after that. I bought this CD thinking that Blurry and Control were the two best songs ever. They aren't bad but they get boring really fast....just like all the other songs on this CD. Out of My Head isn't too bad, with its good rock sound but it got boring. She Hates Me is a funny song but I lost interest in it rather quickly. There isn't much to say about this CD. Unless you have nothing else to buy, I would set this aside."
3,"grunge is over, guys...","if your looking to buy this CD for the song ""blurry"" because you think there will be other great songs like it on the CD, dont even waste your time with this CD. download it or something. The rest of the songs remind me of the early 90's. Even the booklet and CD art itself reminds me of an old Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, or Nirvana CD. Grunge is over, and this stuff is mainly just heavy recycled stuff... Control is a fun song... and thats just about it on this album. not much great stuff on this album, just all filler stuff. dont waste your time if you are just looking for Blurry. its not worth the 15 bux for that one song."
1,I always need a new coaster,"Let's see what do we get here you say? Yet one more Nirvana rip off band that lacks the compasion and originality of the supirious original. horrible lyrics, horrible singing, horrible music. A great coaster"
1,Puddle of Garbage,"If you think nirvana was bad enough, this pile of s***is even worse, this is an annoying piece of trashthat even kurt nobrain would hate too, poor songspoor writing and even worse guitar playing in yearsThankfully terrance j. reardon did not review thisThank You kurt nobrain and Fred Douchbag you allowed this stupid music to happen, Puddle of Mudd totally sucks so badly."
1,Stay away...,"Puddle of Mudd is awful and their lead singer Wes has a horrible voice. Don't compare him to Kurt Cobain or Eddie Vedder. Unlike Wes, these two have serious talent. Wes just sounds like crap. And the music is garbage too. Bands like Puddle of Mudd just write singles to get on the radio so they can trick stupid people into buying their crappy album. Stay away from this band!"
1,Puddle of Slop,"Another alternative band that has nothing but noise for music has taken our society by storm. This one is trying to sound like Creed, who in turn, tries to sound like Pearl Jam. This CD is horrible, and has nothing musical about it at all. None of these band-members have talent. It is all noise pollution that gives you brain damage. We are looking at a rip-off of a rip-off. If Creed is so horrible as a Pearl Jam wanna-be band, then Puddle of Mudd must be beyond that! Creed's lead singer can't sing, and neither can this guy. What is with all these explicit lyrics? Do these bands think that swearing makes them more popular? Please go and spend your money on some real music, and don't waste time buying something that will contribute to pollution of our radio stations."
1,Fred Durst finally found a band worse than his own,"Throw away all your Pearl Jam albums, 'cause this is the only rock you'll ever need!! Haha, just kidding. If you couldn't already tell by the name, Puddle of Mudd is something to step on. Their single, ""Control"" is weak, repetitious and gets old very fast. The rest of the album is even worse. Whiny lyrics and poor instrumentation mix to create an incredibly weak and watered down sound. In trying to mix grunge, metal and alternative music, the band only succeeds in sounding cliched and outdated. And of course, the needlessly swear a lot, 'cause that's soooo cool. And it sells CDs.Skip this one."
1,Puddle of Mudd fans are dumb.,"This one Puddle of Mudd fan wrote a review for a Nirvana album, and said Nirvana ripped Puddle of Mudd off. Even better he said Alice in Chains ripped off GodSmack! It was actually the other way around because Alice in Chains even had a song called Godsmack! Godsmack and Puddle of Mudd are the true rip off artists! Dumbass!"
2,UGH!,"This is the last time that I buy a CD just because I think that the track on the radio is cool! The rest of the CD sounds like it is skipping because you can't tell one song from the other. Unfortunately, the rest of the songs are nothing like ""Control"". The only reason I gave the CD 2 stars is because that song is on there."
1,no talent hacks,"this album gets an F. this will be laughed at worse than twisted sister 10 years from now. where did this incompentent dolt learn how to play guitar, sing and write? sorry kids, this is, um crud."
2,CD was okay,"I rated Puddle of Mudd's ""Come Clean"" 2 stars because well I only liked 2 songs-Control and Blurry. I got to really listen to this CD and then I'll give my opinion of this CD."
1,eh,"Puddle of Mudd really does sound like everyone else out there, which really is disappointing!! I thought She Hates Me was fun...and Psycho too...but then the rest of the clips could all just be the same song, ya know?? It's getting old, boys..."
5,Puddle of Mudd does not equal fred durst!,"Don't listen these fred durst haters. Im not a fan of fred durst either but he got these guys started and thats no reason to hate Puddle of Mudd. They have alot more substance in thier songs than most other bands these days (limp bizkit) Judging from the bad reviews, i find it ironic that people who buy nickelback, a band with good reviews, also buy puddle of mudd. With both styles of music being similar, It makes me wonder why puddle of mudd has only gotten bad reviews.......fred durst?"
2,A Waste of Money,"After enjoying ""Control"" and falling in love with ""Blurry"" on the radio, I had to have this album. What a waste of my money!These guys have a whole lot of growing up do. The lyrics on most of this album are juvenile and stupid. I'm talking middle school mentality here. Songs like ""P**s it All Away"" and ""She Hates Me"" are simply an excuse to use explicit lyrics and call it music. Other songs are also childish and not well organized or orchestrated. With the exception of the really fantastic ""Control"" and ""Blurry"", this sounds like the demo tape of a Nirvana/Offspring worshipping garage band. Except for the 2 already on the radio, the rest of this album is utterly unoriginal, uninspiring, and totally forgettable. Which is perhaps a good thing, because I'd like to be able to forget that I paid good money for this album."
1,I Can't Believe This Crap...,"With their new album getting put down even more than this one, some people might forget about how bad this is. Well, if people could forget about it all together, tha'd be better for the world, but if people are going to remember it, let them remember this: it SUCKS. It's unoriginal. All the songs sound the same. Their singer has the only voice in the rock world I literally cannot stand. I can't believe how popular the unoriginal ""She Hates Me"" was. Wow. What powerful lyrics that has. AVOID THIS UNORIGINAL PIECE OF CRAP. Mainstream music's bad enough. All they play on MTV anymore is crappy Outkast and Lil John and rap and pop, and when they do actually play rock, it's this, Simple Plan, The All American Rejects and s*it like that.METAL WILL RISE!!!"
2,Bland/Unoriginal/MainstreamCrap,"Puddle of Mudd has a solid enough sound, but that sound has already been done to death by bands like Creed (yeah, they do sound like Creed... you're in denial), Linkin Park, Staind, and all that other mainstream half-assed rock thats on the radio and MTV. That would be alright if the lyrics had been innovative and/or intelligent. they're not (oooh he threw the word heroin in a power ballad, what a classic!). And as for the reviewer who said that there arent any original bands left, you're absolutely right, you know everything (...dumbass). You want original, pick up a Mindless Self Indulgence album. That's original."
1,"Sad, what rock's come to","It's bands like Puddle of Mudd and jerks like Fred Durst who will create rocks ultimate downfall. By creating bad music like this and advertising it everywhere(like on mtv), it will eventually make bands like these the stereotype for rock. *Sigh*.If you like this stuff, that's fine. I'm not a purist, so I got nothing against you. Please go listen to a slightly more respectable band, like maybe Nirvana."
1,I can't stand these posers,"First off, the song ""She Hates Me"" is a straight up ripp off of old Suicidal Tendencies "" I saw your mommy and your mommies dead"", which was actually alot better and the lyrics were sweet. Second off, these guys are not Grunge so please quit calling them grunge people. They are not even and will never be close to what the Grunge sound really was ( MotherLoveBone, Soundgarden,Green River,Alice In Chains, NIRVANA). Puddle of Mudd in my opinion sounds alot like Nickeback and all of those other wannabe bands of today that have no skills or talent, but fans seem to buy their stuff because they don't have a clue of real music. Actually, I think that many people don't want to give old music a chance because it's not new and may not be real music. Puddle of Crap sucks along with Nickelcrap. End of discussion."
1,My god...,"I don't think any of these TRL kids will get a life... EVER.Is this kind of music out there to just make you mad.We're in need of some good music. (Tool is the only good one i can think of off my head)Please God, send us another Zepplin/Floyd/Who"
1,keep up the bad reviews!,"we need to get the nu-metal out of the music industry for good,or at least regulate it to the high school CHILDREN!anyone over the age of 18 who finds this cd intruiging,smart,or ""sassy"" must have some very serious developmental problems in the head!I can't see for the life of me how some fruitcake can headbang,dance,or see that this is cool in any way,fasion,or form.When all you mtv lovers finally grow up,take a listen to bands like Type O Negative,Down,Soulfly,Sepultura,Sigur Ros,Buckethead,Death cube k,Primus,Angelo Badalamenti,Kronos Quartet,Corrosion of Conformity,Tool,etc.Or please watch a movie directed by David Lynch,David Croneberg,or the brothers Quay instead of""honey"",""2 fast 2 furious"",.......i.e. plug yourself into the world for once!"
1,Puddle of #&^*,"What an overrated band! They are terrible! Just listen to their new single ""She Hates Me""! ""Blurry"" was cool when it was first out but radio overplay destroyed the enjoyment. Bad vocals and bad music which is god-awful. Avoid this potential coaster cd at all costs and listen to some great music like Hatebreed, Biohazard, METALLICA, Coal Chamber, The Union Underground and Disturbed."
2,Not as good as it seems.,"The infamous Fred Durst...the only thing he's ever been good at is selling-out...and discovering new bands, those that are great (Cold, Staind) and those that aren't so great (Puddle of Mudd). Puddle of Mudd is a your typical 80's metal band; big hair, loud guitars, and a sometimes annoying singer. I bought this for ""Control"", which I thought was OK, not great. I figured that because I liked all the other bands Devil Durst brought around, I'd like these guys, too. Nope. They are very talented, you pretty much have to be if you are in the music-buisness. The only problem as I see it is their singer. I agree with the other reviews, he does sound a lot like an 80's rock 'n' roll singer. They should just make him another guitarist (he does play guitar, folks) and get a new singer. That's just my view, though. But, there is hope for these guys."
1,More like a Puddle of Crud,"Puddle of Mudd is everything a teeniebopper wants in a supposed ""rock"" band. Soft, catchy, pop music with no real edge or attitude to speak of, and songs that are very repetitive and make you think ""haven't I heard this before?"". Lead singer Wes Scantlin has the most unsufferable voice since Creed's Scott Stapp, and a lot of the songs are contradictory in their lyrics as well. This is packaged, wrapped up, teeniebopper music made up by none other than Fred Durst, so that oughta tell you something right there. There are resemblances to Alice in Chains as well musically and physically, Wes Scantlin looks a lot like Jerry Cantrell minus the talent. Expect Puddle of Mudd to be blasted on TV and the radio from now on until after the holiday season, than in four years no one will know who they were."
1,"""I saw your mommy...","And your Mommy's Dead!"" You know, that song by Suicidal Tendencies? ""She Hates Me"" has the same guitar riff in it. Muddle of Pudd will never be half as good as Suicidal Tendencies or Nirvana for that matter. Where did ol forgettable Fred get these guys from? That's the question."
1,boring,"::yawn:: another run-of-the-mill band, absolutely nothing spectacular about these guys, sounds just like every other new wanna-be metal band, just a group of guys picking up instruments and banging away to make a bunch of unimaginative noise. purely a commercial CD, and a waste of money at that...if you're looking for rock/metal bands with innovation and talent, pick up anything by Tool or the Deftones, you wont be dissapointed."
1,(not) WANTED,"By large multinational record company: four talentless rock dweebs to fill out band positions. Don't worry, we've written everything, based on focus groups who have rewritten the top five songs on the ""hard music"" chart. No original thought required, since you will be playing essentially the same song over and over. Must be able to play instruments in way that conveys angst in video. Call now, and don't miss this million dollar opportunity to be the hero to middle American teenage males who are still angry about not making the football team last season!! Bonus: will get to work directly with aging nerd Fred Durst."
3,Half of it good-half of it bad.,"This is a classic example of a band that just doesn't have enough for an entire CD, so they use filler. The first six songs are great! Then you get to the seventh song and you're like 'What happened, man?' Well, what happened is they shoulda trashed the last five songs and written a new batch that were good. 'Blurry' is a spectacular song, 'Control' and 'Out Of My Head' just plain rock, 'Drift and Die' is a good lyrics song, 'Nobody Told Me' is also, and 'She Hates me' is just funny. The last five songs just bite hard core though.My advice is...to not buy this CD, but burn it from a friend. Trust me, you won't be 13 bucks in the hole for a mediocre effort."
1,beyond third generation copies,"Just to add another band these guys aspire to be- Days of the New. I totally agree with reviewer Jeremy Snyder, if you wanna know what I think just read that review."
2,Waste Of My Time AND Money,"I can't believe that a band that produced one of my favorite songs of 2001 (Blurry) could put together such a sh!tty album. I mean by the time most people decided to buy the album, they were already sick of ""Control"". ""Blurry"" and ""Said"" are the best songs on the album. Honestly, this album isn't worth the money put in to buy it. You're better off downloading the two singles and forgetting that this album even exists."
5,One of the best rock albums out in a while.,"Like the other reviewers I'm not a fan of Fred Durst but what a great band he's backing ! I don't usually listen to new music because a lot of it doesn't have feeling or just a message of ""bling bling"", violence, girls or cars but Puddle of Mudd brings themselves out in this album. Great songs like ""Control"" and ""Blurry"". I haven't bought a cd in months and I got this one as a gift . I'm glad I did. From the first song to the 11th -- the album is great."
4,Excellent freshman effort,"I really liked this album,which is saying a lot. It mixes alternative with grunge and this album is pretty tight. It starts out with the best song on the c.d which is ""Control"",and by the end of the album your ready to play it again. I would definetly say this album turned out good,for a freshman effort,and I would recommend it to any grunge/alternative music fan.I don't think you'll regret buying this album."
4,"""Puddle of Mudd ""Nirvana Wannabees With Just The Right Stuff","When i bought this cd i was thinking about how this was just another grunge rock album that has copyed the same old Axil Rose Curt Kobain mold of most of the bands on the rock scene today. And for the most part it is. But that isn't nesecerely a bad thing. In keeping with this tradition puddle of mudd does just about the best they can with an old idea. Showing catchy, kinda of fast, melodic rock tunes (""She Hates Me, Control) with the ocassional slow thoughtful ballad (Blurry) and a lot of slow rock grunge (Basement, drift and die, piss it all away).Some of the best of the genre."
3,Fred Durst dont get props!!,"The CD is good, though the singles are the best tracks off of the CD. The lyrics are all intelligently written, which is difficult to find in any music these days. The band sounds good-nothing that will save rock and roll, but a great stand out from the new metal poser crowd like LIMP BIZKIT!!!!!"
1,I threw this in a Puddle of mud(d),"Wow, is there a better example of crappy wannabe alternative music than Puddle of piss? Their frontman thinks he can pull off the Cobain look without the Cobain impact, what a jackass. I'll admit Kurt is one of my idols (along with Robert Plant and of course, Ozzy (Osbourne)) but this is just ridiculous, he probably doesn't take showers either. Okay, back to the review. Their guitars are repetative and extremely crappy and lyrics are that of a wannabe grunge band (see Alice in Chains). ""She F***ing Hates Me"" gets very, very annoying after 2 listens and the one where they're in the cabin (music video) is very poseur. This is one of the reasons why rock sucks today (most of it) and I hope some awesome metal band comes along to stop this s***."
5,Love the cd,"I love this cd and band, because they have their own unique way of expressing themselves and i love the type of guitar they use."
3,"Pretty good, but I find a serious lack of talent","Puddle of Mudd is probably one of the best things Fred Durst ever made. Still, Mudd has a lot to work on before their next album. They need a new singer- Wes is annoying and has no melody or range. The rest of the instrumentals aren't that great.The best songs are Control, Blurry, and She Hates Me. Control, the bands first single, is all-around better than any other track: it's heavy, a slight display of instrumental talent, OK lyrics, etc. Blurry is pretty good but Wes's annoying vocals come in when he tries to get some kind of flow and attempts to sound dramatic or romantic or whatever. She hates me is a fun song, not really that heavy. Wes isn't that off on this song, and the instumental are actually exceptional."
3,"Not very original, but solid.","Replace wes with a decent singer and you have a winning combination. Its obvious that he is lacking in his ability and it shows (especially live). Similar to Mr.Cobain, it is sufficient for the types of songs on the record. Unfortunately due to their relationship with Mr. Durst of limp bizkit fame, they have gotten a bad rep among the metal/hard rock fans. It hasnt hurt their sales though..."
1,i bought this when i was a clone,"puddle of mud the nirvana of 2000 god these guys try to be tough hiding behind distorted and swearing and wearing their caps backwards OWWWW big men i can't cope with it killing me i think i'm gonna wet my pants at how lame this band sounds after their hit single ""she hates me"" has drifted away..and it's replaced with more media twoodle which will get the clones with their hoodies and chains in their pockets and baggy trousers going crazy and wetting their pants NOT COOL NOT ROCK AND ROLL AT ALLare puddle of mudd really trying to re-vive grunge that they have to rip off all the riffs of the great bands i.e pixies, screaming trees etcanother band that nicks stuff just like oasishell i had to wind up the oasis fans aswelli hate puddle of pukeavoided buy anything by the pixies, screaming trees the cult before thisonly if your a ten year old hoodie year clone then you will think it's the greatest album ever madewell i'm a 19 year old and i think it sucks!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Rip-off Garbage...,"Don't even call this grunge. Puddle of Mud is a cheap rip-off of Nirvana. Real music fans will know better. This is the commercialized version of music that depicted true inner conflict. Take your immtation and shove it. I heard Puddle of Mud is the brainchild of Fred Durst. That's all I needed to hear. Don't support this band with your money or conscious support... it's going straight to the big business record executives. Why go for lead when you can find gold? Invest your money in a Nirvana CD, you won't be disappointed."
1,Bad,Wow were to start with these guys. i think just plain horrible sums up the album. i dont think i have ever heard a lead singer being more monotone and boring. and the actual music really doesnt seem like music. it reminds me of the kids across the street from me who used to get drunk and try to play music after 2 weeks of practice. im sorry to write a strictly negative comment but this is one of the worst albums anyone has ever tried to play for me
3,No Worry about Nirvana -- Music Stolen from Suicidal T.,"I see many reviews about this band doing major rip off of Nirvana. When I first heard ""She Hates Me"" it sounded very familiar to me. I could not place it. Eventually I put in my Suicidal Tendencies Album - ""Psyco after all these years"" and as as as I got to the track ""I saw your Mommy"" I realized where I knew it from. The music (not lyrics) of ""She Hates me"" are almost identical to Suicidal Tendencies ""I saw your Mommy"". If you do not believe me - search for the ST album named above and listen to the sample of the track."
3,Pretty Good,If your a hard core nivarna fan forget it. You will not like this. Puddle of Mudd are overexposed but there is no need to mouth off about them. Some of the songs like Control are pretty good and She Hates Me is ok if you like sumthing lighthearted. So the lyrics aren't very deep and the band arn't in deep trauma but they have produced an ok album. Its alrite 2 critisize but could u do betta? and yeah it does constitute as Grunge so don't even try 2 argue.
5,Love It!,I can't believe there are reviews saying this is a bad album! I love this album--and band. My fav is Drift and Die. Can't wait for the next release.
1,"Was going to resist saying puddle of crud, but i cant!","I read a humourous story, about the singer of this band. He said he was writing grunge before the whole 'scene' happened. It made me laugh at his naivety. This is...stuff. Its like Alice in Chains, Nirvana, and all the other great grunge bands never happened.Something needs to be done about the state of the music industry. This is certainly not it. Possesing bland predictable songs, with lyrics witch explore one dimensional topics, this is something to aviod.While watching tv with my younger brother, Nirvana teen spirit came on. It was followed by Puddle of Mudd song she hates me. My little brother exclamed 'Puddle of mudd are so much better than Nirvana, you cant even make out what that guy says in Nirvana'.THINK ABOUT IT."
1,what IS this [poo]?!?!,"I'm sure I'll be thought of as ""uncool"" by all the young'uns who worship this band and the god of all that [orally de-pressurizes] fred durst, but whatever. it really is sickening to see that just about anybody can get a record deal nowadays. please people, please stop letting MTV lead you to the musical battlegrounds like lambs to the slaughter. this is pathetic, weak, and ripped off. ""i like the way you smack my...""? great lyrical genius. right up there with ""let the bodies hit the floor"" and the ""totally KEWL"" chocolate starfish album. expect nothing, for that's what you shall receive..."
2,Puddle Of Crap,"This album is absolutely horrible. The only reason I give it 2 stars instead of one is because they managed to pull off one good song, Blurry. If it were'nt for that song this would be by far one of the worst albums of 2001."
3,Sits at the back of my CD shelf.,"Bought it for the hits (which I did against my better judgement), but the album as a whole lacks substance. I can't listen to bands who cannot put a complete album together. Not every song should be a hit, but there must be some kind of cohesion.Having said that, the popular tunes are great."
1,lame,every song sounds the same except She Hates Me. That's all I have to say.Oh yea! Go buy some Pearl Jam!
2,Not as good as you may think...,"I bought Puddle of Mudd's Come Clean for ""Control"" and ""Blurry"", and now, 3 months later, I still only like those 2 songs. The lyrics are all very good, but the singing and music kind of...[stink]. It pretty much all sounds the same! Now, I know they can make a better CD then this! C'mon! Fred Durst has produced great Cds before (meaning Cold:13 Ways To Bleed On Stage & Staind:Break the Cycle), so know he could've made this better. But, then again, all the debut albums that Fred produced weren't as good as the sequels, so ya never know!"
4,Durst Does it Again,"1. I'm already sick of comparisons of this band to Creed. 2. Wesley Scantlin does not sound like Eddie Vedder. 3. People need to quit labeling groups ""post-grunge."" Grunge was not a time period - it was, and is a musical style....and for the review. Well, the main reason I picked up this album was because of the single ""Control."" I played it in my car, waiting for dissapointment after Control ended, but to my suprise, the rest of the songs actually make the album worth owning. There is a consistent hardness throughout the album even on the ""lighter"" ""She Hates Me"" which is kinda of a wacky song...more fun than wacky.What got me even more on this album, is this is one of Fred Durst's ""star search"" bands that he just found and happened to give a record deal (much like Staind...Durst's other mentionable). Puddle of Mudd shows that Fred Durst has actual musical taste, which is undetectible on his own albums...Buy this album. Wont dissapoint."
5,Give me a break with the bad reviews....,"Puddle of Mudd has come in to their own. I've seen them in concert, I listen to their music daily. I am not sure what's up with the bad reviews, but thinking it is someone with a grudge of some sort.They are new. They are different. Blurry is about Wes Scantlin's son, it has a great message. Control is a favorite of mine as well. Love the lyrics the rythm of the music. The video is hilarious, as we all know what it's like to fall out with a mate. She Fckn' Hates Me is another favorite, it's funny and shows a fun side of the band. Give it a try. Listen to them. Go see them in concert- you won't be disappointed! They are a favorite of mine, hope they will be a favorite of yours as well!"
1,what were they thinking,"the worst album of the year and one of the worst albums of all time.""she hates me"" one of the worst songs of all time buy something like led zeppelin or pink floyd.ps. you people who like this go to hell.you are all gay"
1,Nirvana?,"HOLY COW!! Kurt Cobain is still alive....Nirvana is back. I love Nirvana and Pearl Jam, and hopefully we can have a change in the industry real soon other than watching disney kids perform circus performances and Divas live with Celion Dion (sp?), but this is not the answer. Hurry up Pearl Jam and release your new album please....."
2,Eh.,"I just don't enjoy this cd. All the songs released as singles...including She Hates Me, which shouldn't have been a single, just a song you can throw on when you're angry...are the better songs on the cd...and anyone who thinks Blurry is a bad, unoriginal song is kidding themselves. But the rest of the cd is just plain boring to listen to. And I'm a fan of mainstream rock."
3,Sick of the Nirvana comparisons,"Some of the reviews say that there post-grunge like Creed, Nickelback and Staind are. But there not post-grunge there basically ARE GRUNGE.When Punk got popular in the 80's. Than, Nirvana got popular in the 90's Nirvana was a Punk band. But no one cared, they thought it was good music. Pearl Jam's ""Ten"" sounded like a typical Classic Rock-like band. Ten sounds like The Who, The Doors, and Led Zipplen in a Jam Session.So why bash Puddle of Mudd? Because they sound grunge-eqsue? Than bash Nirvana and ""Nevermind"" because that sounded like a noisey version of Punk music."
1,good spelling,"Puddle of Mudd is a pathetic band. The singer is always talking about how much his voice sounds like Kurt Cobain's and how he was down with the whole grunge thing. That's a lie because Puddle of Mudd is no better than Linkin Park and several other...bands. You can tell they ...[are bad] because Fred Durst had a lot to do with their CD. Durst also co-produced Staind's Dysfunction, but that's actually pretty good so pick it up."
1,Why bother,"This has got to be one of the worst albums I have ever bought. It seems like Puddle of Mudd took everything that made Nirvana great and beat it to death. Alot. And if you like Eddie Vedder's voice, try Pearl Jam, maybe?If you really aren't satisfied with little sound clip previews, download a couple of songs and see if you like them. If you don't like most new releases these days, chances are you won't buy the C.D."
2,Doing it Again too Soon!,"Clearly the music of Puddle of Mudd is heavily influenced by many of the Seattle bands from the early to mid '90s. The similarities do not as much reflect Soundgarden, Nirvana or Pearl Jam but more so resemble the music and styles of Alice in Chains and Candlebox. The music on Come Clean isn't bad but it is highly derivative of a genre that was recently put to bed for what should have been a substantial nap allowing the style to evolve, emerging into its next incarnation. What's happened with bands such as Puddle of Mudd and Creed is really more of a premature rehashing.At the same time, Puddle of Mudd is unquestionably catchy but they just need to find an identity of their own. Oh, by the way, the early '90s called and they want their clothes back!"
5,"Finally, Some Mainstream Rock","With all the new metal, rap metal, bubble-gum pop it's nice to find a band that's just plain ole hard rock. No turntables, no choreographed dance routines, no over-the-top screaming into the mic, just back to basics hard rock.I don't know if I'd classify it as grunge, though you can see that genre as a definite influence. It sounds more just hard rock and roll to me.And it hasn't left my CD player in the month I've owned this CD. I kid you not; I have not gotten tired of listening to this. And it's not just a couple songs, and skipping what's in between -- there is no song on this CD I don't like.Puddle of Mudd has become one of my favorite bands."
1,wow this band blows even when trying to copy others,the reviews prior to this are all true this group [stinks] when it comes to originality and sound. i could compare them to a decent group like fuel (fuel 238) but that would be a big diservice to fuel who are very good but not this unoriginal in both sound and content. listen to em if u like em oh and totally comercial!
4,Sick of the critisism.,"People, wake up. Grunge is dead. As dead as Kurt Cobain or Layne Stayley. The bands sounds similar to Nirvana or Alice In Chains, but, Metallica sounds simalar to Motorhead and Judas Preist,and no one says anything about that! Hell, Tool sounds like Alice in Chains, but no one says anything about that!Bands influence other bands, it happens! Get over it! Get a life!"
3,Ya' gotta' have it!,"Grunge music hasn't sounded this exciting in ages! This is a must have if you like grunge, like me!! These guys have a style all their own, plus the lead singer likes to show off his cute little boy in videos, which seems totally appropriate to me!In short, you can't go wrong with this new-age grunge cd! It lifts grunge from the dead, and brings it back to life!It really is pretty good!Check ya' later!!"
1,Lame version of Nirvana (Nirvana Sucks too),"I Never liked nirvana either, but they are a masterpiece compared to this truly even worse a horrible band and this album, this album is a disasterzone at all costs, it's so bad, it makes me want to scream, She Hates me is horrible, everything else is horrible and can you believe that this is the person that gaves another horrible band (Limp Bizkit) is by the idiotic frontman fred durst.This is a terrible album."
2,"Good grief, Charlie Brown!","My first clue that I wouldn't like Come Clean: it has cover art featuring a little boy relieving himself. If that doesn't scream out ""this music stinks!"", I don't know what does. Okay, to be fair, ""Control"" and ""Drift and Die"" are good songs, but this CD isn't anything you need. These guys try way too hard to be a second-rate version of Nirvana, when they could be more original. If you want to buy this CD, borrow it first if you can. POM does manage to be a rather enjoyable band at times, but I have to wonder about their fans, the ones who say that they are soooo original and soooo angsty, the kind of stuff they put on the stereo when they are angry and depressed. It makes me wonder if they've ever even heard of bands like Pink Floyd, Alice In Chains, or Nine Inch Nails, since their albums seem to be the music I keep turning to whenever I'M angry and depressed. And they're more original and angsty than POM any day, hands down."
1,What a predicament...,"Would Nirvana have been what they became if they sang what Puddle of Mud are singing about? Not in a million years.Puddle of Mud join the long trail of garbage that has started dominated the ranks of what we used to call grunge. Creed, Nickelback etc..Why would anyone choose to give money to buy this when he can he instead listen to truly great musicians and singers like Alice in Chains, Soundgarden and Nirvana of course (to name but a few) is totally beyond me.What we have here is someone trying his best to imitate Cobain's voice and a group trying their best to sound like the bands of that era. What this results to is: a hilarious outcome like that of some tribute band out of Hillbilly land. I wouldn'teven bother with this band even if the promoted themselves as a cheap pop band (which is what they are)...How low will the american music scene stoop before it rises again? Judging from recent releases it will take a while yet..."
3,Meh..,"I'll give Fred Durst some credit he sure knows how to pick the radio bands and thats exactly what this album is. A collection of songs fit for the top 30 charts that get worn out fast. Yes the vocalist sounds very similar to Curt Cobain but their overall sound is different. A touch of grunge cut with todays modern rock just screams airplay. If you can still listen to ""She Hates Me"" and not want to puke then by all means purchase this record. If not, don't waste your money."
2,Fair.,"Puddle of Mudd is too overrated and not what it's deemed to be. The only song on it worth hearing is ""Blurry"", which is very moving. The other tracks are ... poor. ""Control"" is O.K. but gets old after awhile. ""She Hates Me"" is pathetic. I know some of the simple songs are best, but ""She Hates Me"" is just too simple. I can write it better. As for the album itself, the lyrics [not good], the music is rather cheesy, and the singing is also pretty bad. Avoid this album. It's overhyped and overrated too much. Listen to some of the samples on this website before buying. You'll be glad you did."
4,Good but not Life Changing,"This disc has amazing vocals but isn't a life changing CD because its yet another band made by the hard rock machine. you have to know not all of these bands are depressed and upset. There is some top notch stuff here, so it's worth whatever you pay for it. Check this one out."
2,"Sorry guys, the grunge era was a decade ago..","This album is nothing but watered down grunge-era music. Puddle of Mudd has taken an amazing genre of music and spit in its face with their Nirvana-esque songs that are anything but original. Don't waste your money; buy some Nirvana, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Smashing Pumpkins, Sonic Youth, Mudhoney, Alice In Chains, Screaming Trees, Stone Temple Pilots, The Vaselines, etc. instead of throwing away your money on this sickening album."
5,This Album is a Classic,"This album is a classic. Wes Scantlin, Paul Phillips, Greg Upchurch and Doug Ardito combine the brilliance of hard rock with a ton of stuck-in-your-head melodies. Puddle of Mudd have come a LONG way in a hurry. Wes Scantlin (singer & guitarist) is the only surviving member of what Puddle of Mudd USED to be. Back in the early to late 1990's, the band consisted of Jimmy Allen, Sean Sammon, Wes Scantlin and Kenny Burkitt. They had 2 official releases: ""Stuck"" (E.P.) and the full-length ""Abrasive"" album. With songs like 'Drift & Die', 'Control', 'Out of My Head', and 'Blurry', this album is IMMUNE to just sitting on the shelf. In the words of Wes Scantlin, Puddle of Mudd will be around for a long time. I wouldn't understand why they wouldn't be; I am probably one of their biggest fans.http://gotmudd.cjb.net"
5,They are Not Nirvana Copiers,"ok first off puddle of mudd has not copied Nirvana,they are simply another grunge band. yah some of the songs sound similar to Kurts spine tingling screams and lyrics but ever person who wrote reviews about them copying nirvana are idiots. if they copied nirvana what about all the poser punk bands...good charlott, all american rejects, sum 41...who copied who there? anyways about the album...it is excellent. if u are a true grunge fan u need to add this to your collection along with your Nirvanas, Pearl Jams and a Perfect Circles, it is well worth it. Best songs-drift and die, control, she hates me, blurry...BUY THIS"
4,no....,save yerself and get the other version. it's heartwrenching to hear their songs butchered like that.i love their style. and i thought it was a good change after being bombarded by all the rock/rap metal/whatever else hybrid music that was popular back then. they sound very much like nirvana... Wes sometimes sounding uncannily like kurt it's almost scary. i've been going around telling people to give them a listen and that they sound like nirvana minus the angst.she hates me cracks me up. sounds different from the rest of the tracks in this album.
1,come on!!!!,"do i really need to take the time to explain why this is so bad??? (...)P>generic rock ala 10 years ago, horrible vocals, no experiments, no inspiration and no reason to exist.the name says it all...PUDDLE OF MUDD???? what???"
1,why do i have to give 1 star ???,"Yes, they sound like Creed, but that's a degraded version of Creed. I find Creed okay. But I can't help saying Puddle of Mudd is far far below them. The Vocal sounds like a typical new-age power-pop (no, not rock).These are the 'pop'fied version of grunge. If you mainly listen to pop music and just want to try out some alternative band, then you might like POM. But if you are mature rock listener, then I bet my paycheck that you would hate these copycats.Buy In Absentia, Porcupine Tree.. or any of their albums... THEY ROCK!"
3,Worth The Try.,"Please don't think this is some one-shot wonder to maximize your workout - I think too man people have misconceptions that ""stacks"" or these sorts of pre/post workouts will increase muscle size. This helps you to regain the lost amino-acids after a strenuous workout. Amino acids make polypeptides which make proteins, so it will help you recover but don't expect to see massive gains. As far as the taste goes - it's decent. But I can't stand the texture of this item, it's so hard for it to mix in with water because it's so refined. I have to shake it constantly, let it sit for 10-15 minutes, and then"
4,"good and effective, But not cheap","It is good, effective, re-cover the muscle tissue. Good for using prior to excercise. But more expensive if you compare to the other brands."
3,good,"I like it, but I want to change another taste maybe orange.I do not like it when I mix with milk."
3,"Predictable, yet shocking tale of murder and childhood","The best part about this film is the beautiful scenery of Easton, MD where it was filmed. All of the property shown really does exist in Easton. Also, the acting is very good, not just Dreyfuss and Hamilton--but also all of the extras. Everyone who took part in the filming was superb. A must see for all who love Maryland, Murder, or Mayhem."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this movie based on the actors in it, particularly Richard Dreyfus and John Lithgow and the reviews posted on Amazon. They are both really good actors. However, I was deeply disappointed. The movie and the acting was flat. It was pretty easy to figure out that Liv Tyler was really the star and thus, the killer. It was not worth the money I paid and will probably not trust the any more Amazon reviews."
5,An evergreen album,"Just a terrific album. They are so together and in sync, backed by all star musicians. Incredibly beautiful trumpet by Armstrong on Summertime. An evergreen album. You can't go wrong."
3,Good product - be careful!,"Don't buy National Geographic National Parks Trail Guide (Jewel Case) if you buy this! The manufacturer should have shown that Trail Guide is included in NG National Park Maps. I bought both, and could not know this until I openned and installed them - what a waste! I bought this through J&R and they refused to help me with this. Very disappointed with J&R."
4,"Not quite what I expected, but not bad","From the standpoint of being able to pull up and print out maps, this program is awesome. Where it fell short is that there really isn't much information besides the maps. When they say National Park Maps, they mean maps. All kinds of maps. I was hoping the program had some additional information about the national parks. Although, if what you're looking for are detailed maps, then this is the program for you."
2,Misleading title,"This was purchased to obtain the maps of the Appalachian National Scenic Trail. The AT is administrated and owned by the National Park Service, If so, then why is it not included in this map set?Had I known this I would not have purchased this set of CDs. The description did not indicate that that 2175 mile long trail was not included."
4,Single Santa Seek Mrs. Claus,"I enjoyed this movie very much, but why don't they bring out part two. this is also good it picks up where they need to get married before the next christmas. Also Very good, lets bring it out."
3,seriously?,"I always thought that Santa Claus was married. Kinda like a made before ""Santa Clause 3"" with Tim Allan movie."
5,Great movie!,"I really enjoyed this holiday classic, very funny and enjoyable. I didn't want the story to end, and would LOVE to find the sequel to this movie, Meet the Santas. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a great Christmas movie. The DVD is good quality, delivery was fast."
5,family movie,"Nice clean fun family movie for all ages. this one is one I watch every year. sit down with a cup of hot chocolate, some Christmas goodies and enjoy"
4,Better than I thought,"Wasn't sure I was going to like the movie after reading the reviews on Amazon. Glad I took the chance because, though predictable, Single Santa Seeks Mrs. Claus was light-hearted and a good de-stresser. If you like decent movies without so-called 'adult' situations, this is a good choice."
5,A CHRISTMAS MOVIE LOVER,"I KNOW THERE IS A SEQUEL,TO SINGLE SANTA SEEKS MRS.CLAUS,LOVED BOTH MOVIES,I OWN THE FIRST MOVIE BUT WONDERING WILL THE SEQUEL BE RELEASED FOR PURCHASE SOON?"
5,Single Santa,"This is a terrific family Christmas movie. Where is Part 2, ""Meet the Santas"", I would like to purchase this movie. Where can I get a copy? I have seen the second part on TV, but it was not shown this Christmas season. Part 2 is just as good as Part 1."
3,Good Family Movie,"If you like Crystal Bernard, or Steve Guttenberg, or Christmas movies, or all of the above, this is a great movie for the whole family to watch. I had never heard of this one before ordering it, but I thought I would give it a try, because I like the cast, and I was not disappointed at all!"
3,Cheesy yet sweet,"I get in these moods where I need to watch Christmas movies. Not a big fan of Miracle on 34th Street, I wanted to find something a little different. This was a cutesy, feel good movie. Wasn't my favorite, but I've seen worse. Crystal Bernard is funny, yet Steve Guttenberg comes off a little more than weird."
2,Not a good overall movie,"I watched this movie with the TV muted and the closed captioning off. So my review is only based on the visual aspect of the movie.The main thing that ""stuck out"" to me on the movie was the growth on Guteberg's lip. I found it very distracting, and I could not take my eyes off of it.I recommend watching the movie with sound on. This way you will not notice the Gute's lip sore.Note: In the sequal it appears that the lip sore was surgically removed. Check it out. Sorry I spoiled it for you."
5,Great Christmas movie but love it all year,"I got this for my husband since he watched it everytime it came on Hallmark, he was thrilled to add this one to his favorites"
4,A Christmas Tradition,"This a great Holiday movie to add to your collection. There is also a sequel that is not available on DVD yet. If you have cable, you can catch it on the Hallmark channel. It's a great escape from our hectic and often cynical lives."
3,Halloween will never look the same,"Those pesky little critters and friends take you on a ride through some of the most hilarious machs on infamous ghosts and ghouls including Dracula, Frankenstein, The Grim Reaper (Who it turns out is actually Swedish), The Salem Witch Trials, and even the Devil himself. Yakko and Dot are especially funny as is Slappy the Squirrell in the fourth skit. If you are in any way a fan of the show or a general laugh a holic, I suggest you purchase this video."
5,A classic but still relevant,"Streams in the Desert has been around for years, but it's taken me this long to get on board. It is an awesome devotional that only takes a few minutes to read. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to take their quiet time up a level."
4,Streams in the Desert daily devotional readings.,Good reading and great for gifts. I also ordered the journal and my wife really likes it as she's a journal person.Mike M
1,Not as advertised,This product is not leather bound. It does not contain the KJV Scriptures. It also does not contain the place for the notes. Very disappointed when I received the package.
5,Devotional,Such a daily inspiration for me. Very easy to use and very well-made book. Absolutely worth the price. The leather cover feels nice and increases the durability.
4,Streams in the Desert,"Excellent devotional for Christian believers. The large print edition makes for easy reading. Each devotion begins with a passage from scripture, followed by commentaries by one or more writers. Many times these comments take the form of poetry. Readers will be impressed by the spirituality and perspicatiousness of Mrs. Cowman. This first edtion cannot be surpassed even by later editions. The Spanish language version of the 1st ed., is even better. The Spanish language has a spiritual power all its own--It is, as if God were actually speaking to you.S. R."
4,Streams in the Desert,The book is in the condition as advertised and arrived in a very timely manner. I'm totally satisfied with the purchase.
2,Daily religious inspirations,"This would be a great book for religious people who like to read daily inspirations. I personally didn't care for it, but passed it on to a niece who loves it."
4,Great product!,"We are very thankful to find the Lifesaver Wild Berry hard candies at all, so we love the fact that we can buy a 12 pack. Thank you!"
3,"Misleading Title, not the book for me right now","I'm sure in the future I will appreciate the content of this book and the effort placed into it, but this is not a book for me as a ""Beginner"". It seems to be a fine book, but the title should really be change to something like ""Tibetan Buddhism for Westerners"" or ""Vajrayana Practice for Westerners"". I think the other reviewers have too much experience in Tibetan Buddhism to remember what is needed for a beginner and I would discount their reviews accordingly."
5,"this film bites, flesh that is",this cassette is the next best thing to watching or reading any of romero's work. truly the best in the living dead trilogy
3,"OK, but not great","The item was exactly as described, but the shoes don't really seem to fit in very well. It isn't a terrible product, and I haven't found one better, but I'm not a big fan of it. Great for off-season shoe storage rather than every day."
2,Not designed to hold 30 pairs of shoes,Whoever designed this product never field tested it. The metal hangers that go over the door bend when you put too many pairs of shoes in it. We filled about 20 slots up with regular size shoes and the hangers bent so much that we could not close the door anymore.
5,Great news from a fine working trio,"This is an excellent trio featuring Laszlo on piano, John Lockwood on bass, and Yoron Israel on drums. From the fresh voicings on Ellington's ""Satin Doll"" and Coltrane's ""Giant Steps"" to the joy of Laszlo's originals, the group operates as a unit, the same close listening Yoron Israel brought to his work with Ahmad Jamal, and John Lockwood's sensitive accompaniment at all points. The disc was recorded in Boston before a studio audience, and perhaps that helped give the performance a bit of its fire (instead of the sometime sterility of studios)."
5,GREATEST READ EVER!,"I believe that Emmet Fox had a knowledge of God and the universe and religions that was and is beyond dogma. He had a wayof teaching truth with everyday, ordinary life examples.....How to be filled with love in all situations.This collection is truly a treasure. I've given all of my past copies away and now they are out of print. If you can get a copybuy it and USE it.THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT is my favorite.....even as a Christian, I understood so much more after reading this book."
2,Not what I ordered - refund is on the way,"Product was completely not what I ordered but I received an email (very pleasant) and she said the product was not available so would I like a refund. I said ok, and so am waiting for that refund."
5,Another masterpiece.,"Forget tracks 2-11 for a minute. If this album only had ""Terra"" on it, I'd say buy it and expect it to take up semi-permanent residence in your CD player. Although there may be better all-around albums from Caetano, there are several other perfect tracks here, too. ""Sampa"", for instance, has already become a standard (if proof were needed, it has been performed recently by Joao Gilberto in concert alongside Tom Jobim and Dorival Caymmi gems). And ""Sao Joao, Xango Menino"" is one of Caetano's finest collaborations with Gilberto Gil. And for the amorous, hey, try ""Muito Romantico"" on your next enchanted evening."
5,Chris Thile,"Without hearing Chris Thile perform on the mandolin, it would be nearly impossible to imagine the level of mastery on this instrument he has achieved."
5,sparkling stuff!,"This is a really wonderful album. Whether this music is ""traditional"" Bluegrass or not really shouldn't be an issue. This is pure, sweet, acoustic music at it's very best. It's skillfully played by great musicians, who show all the sensitivity and taste one would expect from such experienced and masterful players. All the tunes are great, as are the arrangements. Hats off to the engineers as well, for a marvellous, crystal-clear recording.But all the performances are a knockout. This is absolutely sparkling stuff, particularly from Chris Thile. This young guy is a fantastic musician, and he really shines throughout. Special mention from me for 'Raining at Sunset' - what a special tune this one is! But the whole album is fantastic. You really should check it out. It's a beautiful work of art."
5,"Bluegrass? Indeed not, sir.","I once heard it said ""There is a thin line between a hug and a choke."" Just the same there is a thin line between bluegrass and, well, what isn't bluegrass. While I respect the musicianship and traditions of bluegrass, I am not a fan of the genre.What bluegrass lacked all along was challenging song-writing and melodies that were creative and unpredictable. Chris Thile remedies those shortcomings.Thile has produced a completly instrumental work (I hate it when killer musicians defeat their purpose by trying to write lyrics that are horrible) that is anything but predictable and monotextured. Each song gives a different emotion and association, and therefore, a different feel.Great for driving, cooking, watching rain, just about anything. If you love jazz, new age, classical, or yes, even bluegrass, you will love this cd. Great work, Thile!"
2,Some who wander are lost,"No doubt, Chris has truly mind-boggling talent, as you'll hear again on the latest Dixie Chicks release, and I have really enjoyed his work with Nickel Creek. But he's really a great vocalist and you'll miss that here. Plus, though some of the tunes are catchy, some seem to wander a bit. If you like that ""jam"" sort of feeling as you might find in ""Strength in Numbers"" and such CD's, where the chord progressions and melodies seem at times like an arbitrary framework to show off their many-notes-per-second style, then you'll like this. Otherwise, I would first start with his outstanding work in Nickel Creek, and also check out some other nice melodic mando work such as Aubrey Haynie's ""Doin' My Time."""
3,"Surprised, but not in a good way","Please pay heed to all of the reviews here, INCLUDING the negative ones. You'll see that the glowing reviews are generally by people who love Bela Fleck, while the Nickel Creek fans tend to run hot and cold. I fall into the latter group. Listening to the samples on Amazon provides a feel for the musicianship on this CD, which is superb, no question about it. Nobody can rip Chris Thile for his ability to play the mandolin. But what the samples don't clearly indicate is the complex nature of the melodies, typical of a Bela Fleck performance... probably closer to contemporary jazz than bluegrass. They are certainly nothing like Nickel Creek's initial release, which is one of the best recordings I've ever heard... more of a sing-along style, with warm melodies that really stick with you.If you are a Nickel Creek fan, but you aren't familar with Bela Fleck's music, be cautious about getting this CD."
5,lose yourself,"There's some wandering going on here, but it's a beautiful thing. Chris is like no other, and he's got some great folks with him on this CD. Much more progressive than his earlier stuff. It might put some folks off, but open your mind and sit back and enjoy."
2,Mandolin Overdose,"After having loved Nickel Creek's first album, adoring Chris Thile from the back row of a N.C. concert and digging mandolin music from the likes of Ricky Scaggs, I thought this CD would be a sure favorite. And the music is beautiful, and skillfully done. But after about the third song, my ears seem to close up and I get mandolin overdosed. I guess maybe I'm just not the hardcore mandolin lover one needs to be to fully appreciate this CD."
4,Mandoline Away,"This CD f Chris Thyle is just awesome I have his His earlier stuff as well as some stuff from Nickel Creek, I would say his stuf would be called Newgrass"
5,"""Not all who wander"" is a leap beyond peers","I followed a short path to this album. After being turned on through Nickel Creek, I came to this album. I was stunned with the musicianship and energy of the compositions and the players. Chris is amazing, but so are his cohorts: Douglas, Fleck, Meyers, Duncan. But after listening to this album 50 times, I wanted more and began to check out the other works of his collaborators. From ""Tales from the acoustic planet (Fleck)"" to ""Uncommon ritual (Meyers and Fleck)"" to a half dozen others, I found much that is worthy, but nothing that compares. The mandolin is the best newgrass lead instrument and Chris is the master, His precision as a writer and arranger have no equal. This music is so life giving! The only thing that comes close is his previous albums (""Stealing second"" with Douglas and Duncan)and Leading off."
5,A must have!!,"I bought this CD on an whim because I enjoy listening to Nickle Creek (which Chris Thile is a member of) and fell in love with the CD! Track 1 ""song for a young queen"" is so wonderful that it can only be matched by track 3 ""raining at sunset."" I must have listened to those tracks over 100 times. Chris has taken the mandolin to new levels. He is by the far the most talented mandolin player I have ever heard. My advice...don't hesitate, buy this CD!!"
3,undecided.,"I like Hothouse flowers for reason I hate Corporate rock bands like U2, REM, Oasis, Beck etc.... Because they do it for the love of music, and enjoyment not to prove something, change the world, or be force.I LOVED ""SONGS from the rain"", it's a brillant cd with exception of one or two songs. I bought People when it came out and Home.I like hothouse flowers like JAMES,Cowboy Junkies,old Crowded house and A-ha(see ne release) and not because they sound like U2 and corporate sounding. THEY sound ALIVE.(ok theys sound more Van morrison)I love listening to Hothouse flowers because they never sound dated unlike other performers, based on traditional intruments rather than images or style/sounds. Something you can always go back to because it sound freash."
5,A must have,This is an essential tool and starting point for any shibori artist. Exhaustive history and diagrams and examples. I used this book in my fiberarts classes and recently purchased it for home studio use.
1,optimum nutrition,"out of the tribulus products ive tried so far, this is the worst. it did nothing for me even after going thru an entire bottle. all it did for me was make my skin oily and give me mild acne. definitely not the best product in the optimum nutrition family."
3,El TOPO Dennis Hopper Meets Clint Eastwood,"Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird, Weird and weird Spagetti western madness, LSD in the 1870's. My mind still has not recovered."
1,Garbage,"This piece of heavily censored (via mosaics strategically placed) video would be considered poor quality even if it were not censored. Jodorowsky was controversial to put it mildly and even in the ""anything goes"" '70s, this movie was not well received.The transfer by Red River looks like a fourth grader was copying from a copy and not doing well. Save your money until at least a viewable version becomes available. If it does not, well as I said the movie is almost incomprehensible and was not as controversial as Midnight Cowboy, which originally was rated X and won Oscars!"
2,Overrated.,"I was expecting to be floored by this movie. I wasn't. I suppose that in 1970, the violence and fake blood, gender bending, homosexuality, physical deformity, religious symbolism were big stuff! Shocking! But in reality the film is probably best appreciated by artsy, stoned out movie goers tripping to a midnight movie in 1970. Many people point out that John and yoko were proponents of this film....but then again they could sit in bed for a week at a time. Which would get tedious to most people, which is a good word to describe this movie."
1,El Terrible,"This utter wretchedness of this movie defies a description that even Shakespeare could give. It is quite possibly the most useless, pathetic piece of garbage ever to hit DVD. Unfortunately, not even its own despicableness redeems it. For example, take a movie like Godzilla (not the classic original, but the 1998 version with Matthew Broderick). Godzilla is so bad that you may be entertained simply by wondering what level of awfulness you will be exposed to next. Not El Topo, which reaches levels so inane it has simply declared an all-out war on common decency. Do not be fooled by the positive reviews here. Avoid as you would any annoying insect."
5,Transcendent Cinema,"El Topo was a film I approached with question. This film should not exist, cannot exist, and will never exist, but it is here- waiting to be seen. This is a film about thew journey of a man, led by Mara- his bitter watered lover, into his own enlightenment. It crosses lines between all religions, the Christian and Buddhism traditions being most prominent. El Topo is a hero, unlike most others in cinema, because the world he lives in is an abstraction of our world. The parallells and lessons contained are impossible and unthinkable. Truly, this is one of the best films ever created- its simplicity baffles me because it truly changed me- and that is rare."
5,"Great price, shipped quickly.",I bought this for my boyfriend as a gift. I haven't watched the movie but he loves it. It was a great price and arrived quickly.
5,The ultimate Jodorowsky film.,"This was the film that started the midnight picture shows in the big cities. It was one of John Lennon and Yoko's favorite films. It is one of the most unique westerns to ever have been made. Even though a little gory for some the, film is still a masterpiece."
2,Doesn't work with XBox 360,"Buyer Beware...this does NOT work with XBox 360. Don't waste your money. It says it will, but it won't.I sold it on eBay. Useless if you have the most up-to-date XBox."
2,Sims 2 Fun on PC & Mac but Not on Xbox!,"I recently bought this and thout it was going to be great!, like on the pc or mac right?! But NO it's not at all like the computer version, so I definitely feel like I did not get my moneys worth! Do not by, just wait for the Sims 3 on the console coming next year (Hopefully)!"
3,New Features But disapointing,"I saw the PC version advertise and was excited. Then the Xbox one came out and everything the PC version advertised wasn't on there except aliens. I'm tired of the console versions leaving so many important details. Especially not being able to have babies or grow older which was what the PC version was really about! There was fun things to buy but you can't keep them all because your only allowd so many things on your property so that is annoying. Fun to play but don't expect much. If you can, wait until they come out with a new and improved SIMS."
1,For adults not kids!,"This game is not suitable for children, one of the goals on the game is to hook up with more than one sims at a time and it looks like they are doing more than just kissing! I really enjoyed the first Sims on xbox but Sims 2 is just not for me or young kids."
1,Buy This Game If You Like To Waste Money,"When you first get this game, it is very addicting for about a week. Then you get extremely tired of it for about a year. Then you never want to see it ever again. But honestly, this is as bad as it gets. There's no decent clothing or decent styles for rooms in your house, and you can never find furnishings that you like. So on my free plays, all my houses looked similar because there was only a few house options I liked. You can't build two story houses, and your Sims stay the same age always. When you have a family, you can't have younger kids, just adults. In story mode, there's only one house that's interesting, and even then, it gets boring. Please, don't waste your money on this one."
2,Stick with the PC version as long as you can.,"Sims 2 for Xbox had to have been on my amazon wishlist for at least 6 months, even before they had a box shot for it. I've played every version of this series from PC, to PS2, and onto Xbox, and havent been really upset with its rough PC to console translations. This edition though has three vital changes from the PC version. First, sims do not age. Secondly, no building of two story homes. Lastly, the sims work everyday, unlike the PC's 2 days off per week. These arent features that make or break the solid innovation of the series but the game should have been promoted as a stand alone title, and this console version leaves little to be desired."
5,fun,NOTE: i only rented thisthis game was fun. i made my sim waiting to get to the action. i've never played a sims game before so i didnt know why i couldn't walk on the road but i eventually figured out. thought they just plopped me in a house with housemates. on PC you get to build your house start from scratch. overall i think this was pretty good. then i had to return it. if you want this try hard to see if you want it PC or XBOX (they're a huge difference).
3,Okay,"this game is okay and there are a few things missing:no babies or TODDLER!no aging,no 2 story house,and NO swimming pool!some new features or something new:jackets,undershirt(sweet!)new clothes,diffrnt hair colors(kool!) a surf thingy.i want EA games make the organial game on XBOX and have new items and new features!well i hope EA games will pay attention!"
4,Great learning tool for pre-teens,Pros:Great learning tool for 9-12 year olds.Excellent details.Up-to-date political boundaries.Cons:The globe's skin seems could have been done better.The quality of the globe stand is not as good as I had hoped.
3,Light-weight base,"I chose this globe for my 7 year old daughter. The Pioneer globe had good reviews and a metal stand. Perfect, right? No. The stand is a thin, light weight, tin material. You have to hold the base to spin the globe. I was hoping for a heavier, sturdier base for the amount of money. I would return it if Santa didn't bring it."
1,Not worth the money,"Bad quality all over. The box didn't show any signs of any damage, but the stand was bent. It is made of cardboard that was glued and sometimes the seams didn't match. Not a smart buy at all."
5,The World at Your Table,"We received this in the mail today. It is very beautiful and my kids are in awe of it. As a homeschool family, we felt that the flat map was no longer adequate. I must say, that as nice as this is, and I don't have much to compare it to, it is a bit pricy. I think it is more in the $39.99 price...but that's just my opinion. Hopefully it will last many years of educating our kids at home."
4,Julien Clerc sings american jazz,"If you like the raucus voice of Julien Clerc, and enjoy jazz songs of Irving Berlin, or Ira Gershwin, rendered more recently by singers such as Diana Krall, then you're in for a treat. Julien Clerc has selected a collection of classic american jazz songs, and has asked friends such as Leforestier, Souchon, or Dabadie for new lyrics, and Sanson and Bruni to accompany him for a couple of them. With a very solid musical environment, giving an original French twist to these american classics, this compilation is intriguingly adicting. Julien Clerc is enjoying himself. Let him do his magic, and you will as well!"
4,Geocaching use,"I'm not an expert on GPS units, and other reviewers probably are, so I'm just reviewing how I found its use while geocaching (the reason I wanted it). Currently the geocaching website has a feature where you can add a cache straight to your GPS when its plugged into your computer. The data cord to do this is included with this GPS. I used it right away, easy learning curve, no problems (you had to download a browser plugin at the geocaching website).Creating routes and entering/naming waypoints by hand is easy too. The one thing that disappointed me was I couldn't load additional detailed city maps for it. They don't exist for this unit, from what I could tell at the Garmin website. The accuracy seemed pretty good. Some problems with tree cover, but nothing abnormal."
3,"Good, But not as good as my old gps.12","the vista is good, but in trees it looses reception fast, and not in that thick of trees, My old Garmin gps-12 eat batteries, but it never lost satelite reception, but the vista is great in open country"
4,Excellent but...,"Here in the Pacific NorthWest, it is quite easy to get lost in the back country trails. I used this Garmin eTrex Vista , with out fail (almost) every time. My only complaint, is that under dense tree cover, it tends to loose the single. Other than that, it does almost anything and everything I could ever want and more. I have already used it for ""Geocaching"" and its accuracy has been dead on each time.. down to about 15 feet. I couldn't be happier."
2,Too simple,"It is a good receiver, but its operational system is too simple and slow to use. But for the price, it worths."
2,not that good,"I bought the Garmin etrex vista as a travel aid in case I get lost driving somewhere. The road maps that come in the unit are only of large streets. I bought a CD from mapsource(roads and recreation) which was supposed to enhance the etrex maps to give more detail. The problems are that the maps are 5-10 years old. The cord that connects the etrex to the computer is a 9 pin (female)connector which required numerous trips to a local computer store in order to buy adaptors. Paper maps are more detailed, up to date and far cheaper than the gps which is what I should have stayed with."
1,"Good device, worst service and software imaginable","Garmin's devices are pretty good. Somewhat tempermental, but mostly reliable. It's connecting their software and dealing with Garmin support that is a nightmare. And, you will need to call them because their software has all kinds of bugs and an archaic key system. Customer service hold time: 30-35 minues. Response time for email tech requests: a staggering 5-7 working days. Clearly Garmin does not care about its customers."
1,"garman eTrex Vista 24 MB with Compass, Altuimeter & PC cable","As you can see I purchased this on 08/14/2006. My problem is a couple days ago while using this GPS a blue streak apperded about 1/2"" x 2"". It still works but I can`t read the screen so what good is it? What can you do about it. Please reply or foward to customer service to correct the problem. Thank You James D Rang Jr"
1,DONT BUY THIS,"I have had the misfortune of buying this product, I would not suggest it to ANYONE, you could toss your money out the window and get more of a benefit. The problem is this, Garmin, however may make great GPS hardware, there software ..., Real bad! whn=en you buy a Garmin GPS, you MUST use there software, if you do not, you will not have any information as to where you are. The ...is that there software is VERY expensive, and DOSNT EVEN WORK! I bought the Mapsource Metroguide USA for about ... and then I tried to install it, I selected the region I needed on my PC and I got a prompt to insert ""disk 0"" asking for some file I DID NOT HAVE, I didnt even have that disk! I have written Garmin about this, and have not yet heard back from them. Weather they fix my problem or not is not the issue, the point is if I were in your shoes, I would go with some other product! Good luck"
2,Not for Hunting or Wilderness Treking,"Very simple. If you are looking to be in wide open spaces, then this is a nice unit. If you will be hunting, fishing, hiking, or anything else which would require you to go into a forested area, then you need to look somewhere else. Maybe look to a Garmin GPS V."
2,Wish it would accept an external aerial,"I've always used Garmin's, I've owned the II+ since it first came out and messed around with the 12XL & IV. Back in 2003 I bit the bullet and went for the vista because I thought it would be cool to ""see"" the map on the screen. Well after three years of use I've found that I'd rather know where I am than see graphics on the screen. I still use the vista but not for hiking or 4WDing, signal lock under trees is just not good enough. I'm going to get another Garmin because I'm so familiar with the interface but I've learnt my lesson, I'll get a model which accepts an external aerial. Your experiences may differ."
3,Not what I expected...,"When I got the unit it kept shutting off for no reason. I'm sure it was a fluke but it was frustrating. I was going to exchange it and it realized that for an extra $50 I could get the Vista C, which is color, has a USB cable, and is an all around better unit. The regular Vista comes with a serial port cable and I don't have serial ports so I would have needed a $40 cable. I'm glad I went with the Vista C instead."
4,my favorite new toy,"I originally purchased a Garmin eTrex Summit, and after only 3 months I was so pleased that I upgraded to the Vista model. With its built-in base map and improved screen resolution, I've been thoroughly pleased with this unit. Used in combination with National Geographic's Topo map discs, I've uploaded numerous routes and waypoints with relative ease. It has led me directly to my destination on several peak-bagging hikes, even when the route was not clearly apparent. The unit is solidly constructed, and battery life has been more than acceptable, despite several reviews I've read to the contrary. Only one issue keeps me from giving the Vista a 5-star rating; the 500 waypoint capacity seems very limited, given that the unit has 24 Mb memory available for topo map uploads. Overall, this has been one of my favorite and most frequently used gadgets I've ever purchased."
1,Great until it dies!,We have had our GPS for 3 years and actually used it on few occasions which is why we were surprised when we took it out the last time that it won't function. It errors when loading / starting up. I have talked with Garmin who had me reload the Firmware (3 times) and change the batteries (twice) but it still won't function. They say it passes its own internal diagnostics but it won't work. For the price we paid with as little use as it has gotten and the price we paid for all of the maps I highly suggest you look for another MFG of GPS's!
1,Display sux,The display is dim & hard to see/read. Back light is not very bright. Tried replacing batteries (twice) still no improvement in the display. Returned the unit one day after receiving.
3,Hard To Read,"We loved the Garmin and it helped us locate 4 caches on the first day we used it with our 10-year old grandson.My negative - the numbers are too small and hard to read. If I bought it again, I would get a diferent version.Check you age and your eyesight when you order the product. If you can read the telephone book in dim light you are almost OK with this model."
3,Good unit but not in the Southwest,"This is a great unit overall, but the rubber bumper around the edge of the unit is a real problem for those of us who live in the Southwest. It appears that exposure to the sun and heat causes the adhesive to disintegrate. I have had my unit since April 2004 and in just over two years, it had to be repaired twice for the same problem. I have spoken with a local Garmin dealer who confirmed that other Vistas (and similar models) have this chronic problem. Neither the dealer nor the Garmin can offer any solution but to send it in and pay for out-of-warranty repair of $125. They have no recommendation for adhesives. I have written to Garmin and have not received a response. I think this is a serious design flaw that Garmin has failed to address."
4,The Vista is great unit,"Being in the military and deploying all across both the US and Europe, I have found the Vista to be a great help. The small size, great reception and ease of setup and use by far outweigh the monsterous battery consumption.If you tend to get lost, need pin-point precision, or are just your average gadget freak, this item is a must have. Just be sure to have a supply of AA batteries on hand or a few sets of rechargables near-by.The carry case, car charger and car mount are great accessories which allow you to protect and use the Vista just about anywhere. The charger is a must for vehicular use as it saves you from draining while driving as well.Though I'd have hoped for a suction mount of the vehicle mount, I found that a good piece of velcro on the dash and on the mount works just fine (since I put it in my personal car as well as military vehicles I'm in)."
4,"Excellent product, even outside the US","I was in a personal trip outside the US and I got amazed by the amount of information I could read on this little and not that expensive GPS. I was in Venezuela, near a little town called Tabay (bet you cannot find it in the map) and the GPS was able to locate it and give me precise information of my location, altitude and distances/location to each city around me. I also zoomed on the world map and it clearly displyed the mayor routs on it. Amazing! The only thing they can improve on it is if you want to use it for driving navigation (distances to each city is linear, not driving) and the communication with the computer (that is why I gave it a 4 and not a 5). Highly recommended for outdoor adventure."
2,Garmin eTrex Vista GPS,"I received my Vista about two weeks ago and was excited to get it. After playing with the unit for about 30 minutes I was unable to get a satalite signal. Finally after I got in the middle of the field it picked up on 3 satalites. Thinking that this was a setup thing, proceeded to use the unit trailriding, in the car, walking around. Was pretty disappointed in the reception in all three places, satalite signal was being lost and accuired. One of the biggest disadvantages was if you have to turn on the unit close to trees it can't find a signal, even if the trees are 30 yards away and only 20 feet high and your standing in a opening. Now other than reception this unit does have an easy to use interface with some really cool features like the altitude, time stopped, average speed etc. But to top off the review I think for the money this unit is not worth it. Garmin needs to rethink there reception issue big time. I sent the unit back and looking for a better one."
1,Not what I expected.,This garmin does not work properly . It would have been nice to know that it was set up for a mac computer . So that part is useless to me . The garmin itself goes off for no reason . In short it doesn't work !
3,"Nice Device, GPS locking problems","While the features and screen quality are awesome. I've found its ability to lock on and track satellites to be quite poor. My Vista has difficulty with maintaining more than 3 or 4 locks for any period of time. Even when I'm standing in the middle of a field on a sunny day, pointing my GPS to the sky it seems to have trouble. When using it in my car, while kept in my pocket, or a small bag to carry around it almost never is able to keep a solid lock. Even when I was in downtown on the Statehouse lawn it couldn't lock on enough satellites. I don't think it is reliable enough for use in the woods, and I don't want to have to worry about finding a clear area, or if it's a cloudy day to be relying on this device. It claims 20 or so hours with the battery but it sure does seem to eat them. GPS tracking is the primary use for this and it seems to have trouble with that."
3,Technology still immature,"This device has great potential but the technology is still a little immature. Zooming in/out as well as up/down/left/right even at low map resolutions is slow enough to limit on device trip planning. I have also had issues with the device shutting itself down at high temperatures >110 degrees Fahrenheit even while running the latest firmware (June 03). The speed and compass measurements are accurate and have acceptable update time resolutions. Summary: Great for moderate temperature hiking, no yet ready for road trips and extreme environments."
3,Everything is good except the compass,"I have used my eTrex Vista for over 200 miles of geocaching now. I really like everything about this product except the compass. In order for the compass and direction finder to be accurate, you must hold the eTrex perfectly level. This can be very annoying, especially when walking or on a slope. And folks, the direction finder is a very important feature of any GPSr--you might say it is the reason you get a GPSr. If I get another GPS unit, it will be a Magellan brand with a 3-axis compass. You can hold those at an angle and the compass is still accurate. If you bike a lot, get the Garmin handlebar adapter--turns your eTrex into the world's greatest bike computer!"
2,When it works...,"Everything about the Etrex works; right up to the point the screen fails. And this did not just happen to me, it also happened to two friends of mine. Bottom line I have owned several Garmin products and been quite pleased but the Etrex is not reliable."
5,"hikers delight , eTrex Vista GPS","Great little GPS for hikers and climbers. Couldn't be any smaller or lighter, yet the display is hi res and easy to read in sunlight. Software is easy to learn - I hardly used the manual. Antenna is sensitive enough it works INSIDE my house & away from windows (we have no metal in our roof). WAAS works in US and also in Australia - where its not supposed to! WAAS does not work in Europe, yet. However, WAAS is slow and you really need a good view of the sky, so I only use it for hi accuracy fixes. GPS altimeter is very accurate regardless of weather. Could be improved if the user could choose between barometric and GPS altitude - the GPS altimeter is weather independent. The only other criticism is the slow serial cable - REALLY! USB should be standard! This is my 3rd GPS. With WAAS disabled, it is as sensitive as a Garmin II+ and far superior in every other respect. Software configurability is fantastic!"
4,shwing,this is my first gps so i can't really compare it to anything but the others i used in the stores. this ( eTrex Vista ) does every thing i would ever want and more. i use it for hiking and jeepin. and this thing is awesome. it does every thing from setting way points to tracking you back to where you started to telling you when the next full moon is. the mapsource software is great and highly detailed. the battery life is ok. 2 AA will last you for a long day hike or so. if you have the money and you are an outdoors kinda person i would go for this one.
5,Awesome,"Let me say that this cd is so good that it prompted me to leave my first ever feedback on Amazon. I love this cd and can not get enough of it. ""Jesus, Thank You"" has to be the best song I have ever heard. Thank you Sovereign Grace and thank you our Sovereign Lord."
5,There's no one meanah than Tina!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is one ""cd"" that our friend (""disco"" Mary) is gonna just love to play again & again & again & again (is that enough words?)."
4,Another good product and service to me.,This film was of course never long enough. I enjoyed watching it and will very much enjoy sleeping by it often. Great service in getting it to me in good condition.
1,Disappointed,"I know this is like $5 but I expected a decent movie. Very poor film (there's even footage where you can see sensor dust spots that were not removed) not appropriate for Blu-ray, erratic editing, not a very good narrative, I definitely do not recommend this movie. This is elementary level movie in any case, maybe kids would like it. This could have been much, much better."
2,a documentary that downgrades the incredible sites it describes!,"Could have been done much better, both technically and artistically. I was, before this, looking forward to seeing this, as I was amazed when I visited the Badlands. The movie does not do them justice. Also, no subtitles."
2,Good for insomnia,"I was looking for an interesting program about things to do in the Black Hills and Badlands. While there was some beautiful footage, it did not entice you to vacation there. It barely touched on things to do in the area. They focused on the fossils found there and the different types of animals that USED to roam. That has nothing to do with what's going on there now. Way too much history on Wild Bill Hickock. Nothing about what you can do in Deadwood now. And of course, way too much Native American religious beliefs. I'm not being intolerant. It was just not relevant to your typical National Park exlporation video. I couldn't wait for it to end."
2,What a disappointment!,"This Blu-ray is boring and misguided. How such incredible country can be depicted in such a lackluster way, takes talent. Or maybe anti-talent.The ""stunning high-definition"" was neither. The subjects, the shots, the angles, the cinematography in general, was amateurish and unspectacular.Speaking of subjects, they chose to waste a significant amount of time on the human history of the region. Recreating Custer's Last Stand and Wounded Knee has nothing to do with the grandeur of these parks. Then they threw in the life and murder of Wild Bill Hickok. I am not joking.These parks are vast enough to fill over an hour of a ""stunning high-definition"" Blu-ray, with a tour of the best features. This is what I expected. That is not what I got."
4,Great memories,"When I was growing up, this was our vacation spot, South Dakota. This brings back great memories. And now I have a video of all those places we visited 60 years ago. I have purchased this and other videos from Amazon that we have visited over the years."
2,Informative but not pleasant to watch,"This Blu-ray is very informative but its footage failed to showcase the natural beauty of this National Park. The video could have been done much better, both technically and artistically. It is not the quality of BBC documentaries such as Planet Earth, but of course it is also a lot cheaper."
2,Unengaging,"I was hoping for another beautiful and engaging documentary, after having bought: ""Yellowstone - Battle for Life"".But this is not well done. Unengaged guides repeat information in flat voices, and somewhere in the middle a man that sounds like a school teacher reveals shallow information about a bone collection for what must be at least 20 minutes. None of the interviewed people really has anything to say, and it has too little of photage from the actual places it is supposed to be about.It's like a bad infomercial that runs nonstop in a souvenir shop."
3,some day,"I bought this as part of the package, this one being the most expensive. After seeing it , if I had the choice I would not make this a part of the items I bought. The narration ruins the it, the narrator is dry, even droll."
4,Lynne Arriale - YES,"This CD is a jazz lovers find. Lynne (pardon the familiarity) is an accomplished jazz pianist and integrates her talent well with the group. The pieces she chose for this CD are captivating and uplifting. Her rendition of of ""Black Bird"" is nothing short of heart rendering. This CD is ""a keeper""."
3,eh...,"there seems to be alot of online hype about this band. i bought the album and was, well, a little bit disappointed. like dispatch (which i purchased in the same run), their over-pretentious lyrics and monotonous voices get to be too much. sure, the band is pretty cool, some funky stuff, but, in general, it is just punked-out ska. an A for effort, but the music just isnt there. the cd and band just didnt grab attention. if you are in search of ""real music,"" well, move away from people marketing themselves as ""real"" and go out and dig some cool stuff. my new favs include Travis and Ryan Adams. good hunting"
2,Not good,"Anyone who says this album is awesome, I feel bad for you, because you don't know what good music is. Everything I heard about this band was mixed, and now that I listened to it, I realize why. It has simply songs, and an overall lackluster sound. They're not even close to DMB, Dispatch, or Sublime. Sorry, but the truth hurts."
5,A Tour de Force,"Take it from a guy who got the chance to see this guys live. Buy the CD and if possible, catch them in concert."
4,Love all O.A.R music,I actually listened to this CD for the first time a few weeks ago. What a difference between the music now and this CD. It is not a bad thing but just the inprovement is incredible. Just shows how far you guys have come. I hope you guys continue to make kick ass yet chill music. True O.A.R. fans should understand this. Keep up the great work. This may be a long shot. If one of the band members reads this maybe they can shoot me an e-mail. No not shoot me---lolJamieNiergarth6@msn.com Thanks---You guys kick ass!!!!!!!!!!
1,the worst cd i've ever heard,"this cd was sitting in my apartment one day because a friend of mine had just driven like 14 hours to see them or something and had picked up the cd. being a huge music fan, i put the disc in to see what all the hype was about. at first i thought they were a college band that played in different frats around here or something. even with this misconception i have never heard a bigger pile of ... in my life. alot of people who like oar also like dmb. i personally don't like dave at all, but i can at least admit that he has extraordinary talent, as do all the members of his band. this cd is just horrible. the guy can't sing and they are terrible musicians. i can not put into words how awful this cd is. i hope noone wastes their money and especially their time by listening to this disc when they could be listening to something good."
1,Vanilla ice cream anyone?,"Emotion?! That's the funniest thing I've ever read in my life! I guess if laughter is an emotion, than you're right on! The music is simply boring, and the lyrics are terrible! People are trying to compare this band to Dave Matthews? Okay people, just because a band has a saxaphone and an accoustic guitar does not mean that they are comparable to Dave. This CD is just bad, and the fact that people over the age of 15 tells you exactly what's wrong with music today."
3,Stop.,"O.A.R. and Dave Matthews are two different things. To compare them is ridicolous. Dave Matthews Band has a totally different creative beat and much more talented musicians (Carter! come on, his beats are crazily unmatched), sorry O.A.R. Also, Dave's songwriting does seem to repeat itself like O.A.R. does in this cd. Anyways, ""The Wanderer"" is an alright album. Many of the songs sound the same, with the same guitar lick and reggae beat. I don't care what anybody else says, each song reminds me of the last besides ""Toy Store,"" which is in a league of sloppy playing and bad lyrics of its own. Also the way each song is way too reminscent of every other song. Look, I am not saying O.A.R. is not a good band, they are talented musicians, BUT they need to tighten up their playing and add some variety to their music. If I could do it again, I would've saved my money and just purchased the live album, ""Any Day Now"" because, although again sloppy, has more songs. Thanks."
2,Disappointment,I have bought all the other O.A.R. albums and this one doesn't even come close to the others. I really got into O.A.R. when I heard their latest album so I started collected the rest but this one truly doesn't compare to the others. I think the beats and vocals are not as good as the others. Also the lyrics don't have the creativity as the later albums have. This was a disappointment compared to their later albums.
3,Silly Romantic Christmas Movie,"I love silly romantic christmas movies. This movie is fun to watch, but sort of weak story line, but I liked it anyway."
4,A great feel-good Christmas movie for the family.,"This is one of those movies I saw but never forgot and finally decided to purchase. It almost makes me want to be a kid again and visit a Mall santa to tell him what I'd like for Christmas. Kelli Williams and Patrick Muldoon are perfect, and believable, in the parts they play - So much so, I was rooting for them the first time I saw the movie! All my friends who have watched (and purchased) it on my recommendation, tell me that they, too, felt a connection to the main characters. Wonderful Christmas movie that is just as enjoyable any time of the year!"
5,A Boyfriend For Christmas,"This is a great heart warming movie, yet funny. It is a very touching story that everyone can relate to."
1,not happy,This is one of my mothers favorite movies so I figured I would order it for her for Christmas. When I received the movie I made her open it early because I wanted to watch it and the disc was cracked. The movie is great but I was very unhappy that the disc was not in good condition.
2,Family Fare that Falls Flat,"I love Christmas movies and I love romantic films. Put the two together and you have a no brainer winner. Then why don't I like this movie more? The actors are competent, they're attractive, and the story, up to a point is kind of cute. But there's just no heart in it. When this film digresses into the ""Battle of the Beaus""...it's just too much...to over the top...subtlety out the window. (SPOILER ALERT) Like at the end when the couple each realize that they met as kids...that scene could have been handled so beautifully and with such sweet drama. Instead the director just let's it blurt out...very anti-climactic. Maybe that's the reason I don't like this film more...not enough subtlety...all the way around."
2,sappy and crappy,"This Christmas I DVR'd THE CHRISTMAS CARD and BOYFRIEND FOR CHRISTMAS based on amazon recommendations. I have learned my lesson!I guess there are a lot of people here who are into sappy movies, but this is just bad. The acting is terrible and the story is silly. I did get through it, but ill not be wasting time on movies like this (lifetime movie of the week) ever again. If you want a cute, sappy, well-acted movie try Christmas in Connecticut or some other classic!"
5,Excellent,"This is on my list of favorite cheesy Christmas Movies, I can watch it over and over and never get tired of it."
1,Big Mistake,"Obviously Tesh has come to the point where his music is cold and calculated. You could even tell by the duet with James Ingram, whom he used on his last record. Even the titles are similar; Give Me Forever (I Do) and Forever More (I'll Be The One). The music is erratic and at times annoying. I used to like Tesh back when he was doing sports themes. I think it is time to hang it up and to join Connie on the informercials for your steady income."
2,It's O.K. but not what I expected.,"It takes a lot of patience to listen to 55 minutes of John playing mostly solo tunes. If this is his best, I wonder what his other albums must sound like. boring, boring."
5,A CD THAT TRULY CAPTIVATES YOU!,"If your looking for music that truly moves you, I would highly suggest this album! When listening to it your mind drifts to places that fill you with wonder and longingness. I give John Tesh five star for his remarkable work.-Jake Smithers"
1,Sanitized for your protection!,"John Tesh has an astounding range, really. Sometimes his work evokes the theme music for soft-news television shows such as ""Entertainment Tonight"" (surprise!). Other pieces would make suitable soundtracks to Chamber of Commerce promotional videos (Cleveland--A City for the New Millennium!). But sometimes Tesh brings up deeper emotions; at his very best he could provide the theme music for touching, sensitive films about white people who drive BMW's but still can't find fulfillment. Emptyheaded, superficial, junk-food-for-the-ears."
1,Stop the World music i want to get off,"Sure thats the ticket, i'm awfull in usa,lets tour the world and ruin some other cultures music. Yeah thats what i'm gona do."
1,Worse than I expected,"I have heard much ABOUT Mr. Tesh's music, but decided that it was time to listen to it myself. It was, unfortunately, worse than I expected. I'm sure that Mr. Tesh is a very nice man, but his music is seriously lacking in originality, compositional craft, or anything that would draw a serious listener back to it for repeated hearings. The fact that his music makes some people ""happy"" is all very nice, but please don't confuse this with musical quality. There is a reason that truly excellent musicians and discriminating listeners have such a negative response to his music. It is all vapid emotionalism with no substance.I realize that a lot of people listen to his music, but a lot of people also watch Jerry Springer. My hope is that all of you who waste so much of your time and your hard-earned money on poor musicians like Mr. Tesh, Yanni, Andrea Bocelli and Kenny G will seek out better music and musicians - it is worth the effort!"
5,GREAT FOR KIDS,I am a music educator and use the one world tape and cd as a teaching tool. BRILLIANT.
5,S. Riden says: Simply Matchless,"If you've seen Tesh live like I have, you know about the passion and the magic that are Tesh. If you haven't, or have not heard his music before, I envy you: you're in for a musically-life-changing surprise. This is his best album."
4,Fast easy read.,"I liked the book. Although listed as ""young adult"" I found it to have sufficient substance to be satisfying fare...even though I am far from ""young"".I was particularly fond of his treatment (OK, his opinions) of occult and witchcraft. Those two subjects make fantastic newpaper copy and the stories throw long shadows.I think the book would be much stronger with a slightly different organization. As a parent, I am particularly interested in ""cult-proofing"" my children. Unfortunately, that material is sprinkled over many chapters.I strongly encourage Mr. Cohen to develop a ""quick test"" that young adults can use as a litmus test when approached by possible Branch Davidians. The test (list) would not require absolute accuracy. The objective of the test is to separate wolves from sheep, not to identify sub-species of wolf."
3,"OK watch face, but...",the band is a cheap plastic thing that stands out from your wrist because it's so hard. I will replace the band and hopefully the watch itself is not made quite so cheaply.
5,i LOVE this CD!,This is the perfect smaple CD. I highly recomend it. The grooves are sweet and evocative of romance. All you will want to do is dance and dream. You will be overcome with the smooth spirit of the Bossa Nova.
5,Stick with the original tunes!,"If you had to choose between the newer recordings of these songs on ""Red Hot + Rio"" and this compilation, I say listen to the original artists sing and play their tunes. This is simply the best compilation of classic bossa nova tunes (when you take into account variety of tunes and price of the CD). My favorite is ""Mais Que Nada"" forever made popular by Sergio Mendes and Brasil '66 (but I think this version is way better). I also LOVE ""Agua De Beber"" -- that duet is awesome. What's also neat are the little sound clips placed strategically in between some of the songs. You'll think you're down in Brazil!"
1,Artera supply,"I bought a fasco motor from Atera supply, It does not work, when i tried to call them the number was no longer in service."
3,This book is the coolest!,"People should read this book by Fr. Sweeley. It gives a great undertsanding on Christianity and Judaism. I hope he is writing another book, He is a great writer."
1,Not One of the Best.,"Like I said, not one of the best from the series. It was boring to me, but it might not be to you. Who knows? Sure, if you wish to read a book that will put you to sleep in just ten minutes, then buy it. It was 24th place of all 24 books. The other Madison books are great, unlike this one."
5,"Strong enough for a man, made for a woman!","Going through literally hundreds of new CDs that were submitted to my work, I came across the sampler CD of BENDER. It is a profound full bodied modern hard rock album. These songs have so much energy and soul, I just listen to them over and over and over again. Any group of men that can put together an erotic song about the ""Passion Flower,"" is on my good side! The voice, the melody, the lyrics, the speed, and the rhythm all just grab me and pull me into their depths. Each song is unique and creative. Close your eyes and LISTEN LOUD!"
2,Could have been better,"Monotony runs rampant with this band. I can find many bright spots, namely ""Isolate,"" ""Superfly,"" and ""Angel Dust,"" but this doesn't save this CD from becoming unbearably repetitive. Yes, they sport a much different new metal sound from the mainstream one you're used to hearing, but that doesn't neccesarily mean that it's any good. This band makes great music, but the vocalist just lacks in the talent category. That can hurt a band terribly, and that is definitely the case with Bender, who have broken up since the release of this album."
4,MY OPINIONS AND THE OPPOSITE OF RELATIONSHIPS.,"A VERY ENTERTAINING AND BREATH TAKING STORY BY MARGE PIERCY "" GOING DOWN FAST"" DESCRIBES ABOUT A WOMAN NAMED ANNA.A PERSON WHO IS VERY SUCCESSFUL IN LIVING THE ROUGHNESS IN LIFE OF HOW TWO PEOPLE HANDLE MARRIAGES AND LOOSING THEIR JOBS.IT SHOWS HOW MANY DIRECTIONS IN LIFE PEOPLE FACED THROUGH.I THINK THAT THIS STORY INSPIRED ME,IT SHOWED ME THAT LIFE AND COMMITMENT OUT THERE ISN'T EASY. I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO THE ROMANTIC TYPE OF LOVERS OUT THERE."
3,Was Grunge a Dream?,"When I spun this disc I felt like it was 1993 all over again and I was waking up to ""Serve the Servants"" and going to bed with ""Release."" Whoever said grunge was dead, was lying. It's all here, a wall of muddy sound and lyrics which border between self-loathing goth and socially-confused post-folk. What's new? Bells here and there. If I ever wake-up I'll realize that ""Homage"" is just a Nirvana send up, and ""Baudelaire"" did more for Soundgarden than Soundgarden ever did. Ten years ago I would have loved this album more than my Algebra II homework and the cute zit faced girl in the corner. Today, well, I just think it's pretty good."
2,HYPE machine,"First of all, let's be frank. Most albums reviewed on amazonget high marks because they were bought by fans of the artist inclined to give 4-5 stars no matter what the content.Trail of dead can best be described as heavy college rock, but somewhat light on dischord and irony. This is not to say they don't display loads of talent and energy.This is not a song-by-song review, simply a warning. Fans of Pavement, Stripes, Hives, Strokes, Sonic Youth, et. al,do NOT think you are investing in the same type of music.Source Tags and Codes sounds strangely like Fugazi or Bad Religion with a huge studio budget, or perhaps early 90's favorites Helmet going slightly lo-fi.Place your copy along side ''Relationship of Command'' and create your own sub genre:OVER HYPED PSUEDO ALTERNATIVE HARD ROCKbye"
4,First Impressions...,"Just picked this up and have listened through it a few times. To me it's sort of Sonic Youth flavoured, but a little more refined. I also get a hint of some Afghan Whigs and maybe a bit of Superchunk, as well.Overall, a really nice combination with a wide range of emotion..."
3,an overrated band.,"This band and this album is way overrated. If you look at it one way all they are are the Promise Ring speed up and made more commercial. If you look at it another way they are a very tight band with some good, interesting songs, but mostly alot of good, completely uninteresting songs. It's odd that they can play songs so fast and so well and yet not grab my attention at all.If you're an indie rock kid who actually believes the critics then I guess you would like this. Or if you want to pretend you are.."
2,ZZZzzz!,"I should have learned my lesson after buying the White Stripes own mega-hyped piece of mediocrity, but I didn't.This band is so old hat. I suppose these guys are sort of a high brow version of Tool. Yeah I know Austin is the hippest city in the world blah, blah, blah, but can you really name one decent Austin rock band? I'll stick to my Sonic Youth and to a lesser extent even my Pixies, which share the same relation to And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead as Marvin Gaye does to Ray Parker Jr."
2,disappointed,"the band with the longest name finally hits the majors with the release of source codes, an album i hoped for more but got less. the austin band, known for destroying their instruments live gives you music that is dense with much layered guitar and many effects. sometimes you hear things floating around like flotsam in the mix that you did not hear in other listens. there are elements of emo and post rock and i really see no band to compare trail of dead to. yes they sound like unwound and others in that vein but they charge this genre with their own stamp.i found no joy in listening to this band. the music would float by and it just did not move me. there are loud layered blasts of emo and rock and then the dust settles from the blowout and they give you dark finger picked chords. there are orchestral instruments such as cello and violin that drift in and out the music to vary it up. there were some really good parts but most of it left me feeling nothing."
4,"Oh man,,,,,takes me back a few years","I was at the University of Texas in Austin when these guys just started out. You can not believe the buzz about them that developed among the intella-indie scene around west campus. It was never about their musical ability. It was always about ""oh my god, you have to see these freaks live.""Hearing these guys again takes me back to a show in an obscure hall on a _freezing_ winter night (it actually does get cold in Austin). There couldn't have been more than 20 people in attendance, including the band. Trail of Dead just exploded onstage. They basically attacked the audience. I will never forget it. Well, anyway, these guys have improved tremendously. This is actually a CD that I can listen to and enjoy more than be amused by."
4,they've come far,i've only given it a couple listens but it is grand. quite an epic. if you liked madonna you'll think this better. if the first one is still your favorite then it may sound a bit heavy handed. all and all its impressive and those who have been anticipating this probably won't be let down.
3,Enjoyable but nothing special.,"Source tags and codes is a solid album but certainly doesn't warrant the 10/10 richdork media gives it. I hate to sound like a broken record but some of it is very Sonic Youthesque. And while it is comforting to hear that thunderous wall of guitar noise, none of the songs really stand out. Still worth purchasing if you want to damage your speakers."
1,How horrible,What a bad album. This is a perfect example of being mislead by these reviews. The fact that this album has a rating of above 2 stars is very sad. The lack of talent and melody is made up for by pounding rythm and heavy distortion something that doesn't get the job done.
1,...And you will know us by the trail of boring songs.,"The first tune is simply okay, and it goes downhill from there. I checked out this CD because it was in the 'cutomers who bought this cd also bought...' section on the page for FAILURE's FANTASTIC PLANET. It coudn't be a further sound from that superb disc. Source tags is long and meandering with little to no in the harmony and structure catagories. It sounds like a punk band free-jamming on a Sunday. I should have know a band with a name like this was either too good to be true or, what it really is, drawn out and hoaky."
2,Good instrumentation...horrible vocalist,"I first say this band of Late Night With Conan Obrien, and was horrified by the singer. I finally got a chance to hear the album thinking that he was just a bad live singer. I was wrong, he is even horrible on the album. I also don't like the fact that his vocals are not a a reasonable level. It seems like the band is embarrased by him and try to drownd him out. I will have to say that besides the vocals, it is pretty good, but never good enough to get passed the singer. This band should either be an instrumental band or they should find a new vocalist."
2,nothing new,"everyone seems so excited about this band. honestly, i do not know why. this cd drags on and on, it is a reminder of those long summer days when there is nothing to do except stay inside because it is too hot outside. the music is like a big fuzz. everyone talks about how many effects are used. i really do not hear them, i think that they probably used so many, it is just like static. the entire cd is this way, static chord progressions. and it is barely melodic. everyone compares them to at the drive-in, DO NOT BE MISTAKEN! they are nothing like atdi! at the drive-in was refined, spacey, and melodic. AYWKUBTTOD is none of these. it is basically what you will hear when you go to see a local indie band, except that some songs may be a little catchier. they do compare to old fugazi, but atdi are gods compared to these guys."
5,"It's all right, it's okay, it rocks out in relative ways.","5 may be pushing it, but this is the first CD I've heard in a long time that seemed absolutely perfect the first time around, joing an elite group consisting of Radiohead's Kid A, Beck's Mellow Gold, and Primus's Sailing the Seas of Cheese (no, really). It isn't, but this is as rock and roll as it's going to get for a while.This rocks from beginning to end while still expressing some emotion and musical range. It's not likely to get old any time soon. Definitely in the Top 10 of 2002, and maybe even the Top 5.The only possible flaw is a lack of songs that truly stand out, except for ""Relative Ways.""Great liner notes. They write out ""all right"" correctly as opposed to the usual rock tradition of writing ""alright,"" which is NOT a real word.Also, Trail of Dead can destroy a stage with the best of them. Iggy and the Who 2002.That about sums it up."
5,"cool name and all aside, check this out...","I reviewed this album not long after I bought it, and praised it. Now that it's had more time to sink in, I've found that ""Source Tags and Codes"" occupies more time in my spinner, than anything else, here recently. I've even turned several friends onto it. It's amazing how every time you hear this album in it's entirety, you pick up on something that you missed before. This has to be the most layered album I've heard in years. I'll even go so far as to say that they beat out Radiohead's ""Amnesiac"". Yes, it's that good, and all the naysayers here must have only given it one listening. These guys aren't about instant gratification, folks. Their music is built to last.Do yourself a favor and go pick this one up. You'll keep coming back for more."
4,"beauty, eh...","...loud, distorted and derivative: That describes some of my favorite bands of all time! Let's face it people, it all overlaps. Trail mainly borrow from the Sonic Youth school of punk rock, territory that has already been mined plenty by the likes of Unwound. However, Trail of dead do it way better. In fact, they do it way better than Sonic Youth has since Daydream Nation. There are a few moments that sound almost too Teenage Riot, but it's still really well done, well played, and well produced. Other moments hint at uncharted future territories. If they ever truely find their own voice, Trail of Dead will be a force to reckon with. Mark my words on that, b/c as my brother once said, ""my brother's a genius, eh, he knows the atlas."""
3,Not bad... but pretty anonymous,"Personally felt a little let down by the band. Something of a mixture of epic, wall-of-sound type post-rock (a la Godspeed! YBE, new Unwound, etc.) with a fuzzy hard rock edge that's not too dissimilar from Monster Magnet's earlier more creative and ""trippy"" stuff. Sounded right up my alley. The only problem is, most of the bands that Trail of the Dead sound like have put out better records. The vocals are a little cloying, and the songs muddle together without really gripping you.I really wanted to like this record but after a few listens it disappeared on my shelf and I'm in no hurry to check it out again. Other fans of Godspeed!, My Bloody Valentine, Sonic Youth, etc. might be disappointed. If you're more a fan of sort-of experimental hard rock like Tool maybe you'd dig this more than I did."
3,No more breaking stuff!!!???,"I was so excited! Trail of Dead was supposed to be the band that would once and for all DESTROY EMO!!! What happened?? Im all for bands growing and evolving but ""I wondered what became of you?"" just doesn't compare to ""This is a song about killing everbody lets all sing along now!"""
4,Great rockin',"This one has it's emotional twists and turns. It's possibly in line with Interpol and The Rapture. It's a must-have, and I'll always keep it on my iPod.Can't wait to buy their latest album."
2,can we say OVER RATED?,"I can't even HEAR the lead singer over the music in the song's. The band can really play but they need a new singer, and they need to fix their production value so you can hear everything clearly. I can't believe this was so hyped on MTV2, WAY overated. Check out these better bands.BLINDSIDEPROJECT 86CHEVELLEJULIANA THEORYCRASH RICKSHAWBRANDTSONMXPX"
2,Is it the right size?,I bought this and was so excited but once it came it was to big for my bowl. I thought the wide mouth was the area where you pour your ingredients turns out the wide mouth is for actual bowl. I love the idea of having one of these just make sure it will fit your size bowl.
3,It is nice to have but very flimsy.,"Purchased this Pouring shute to go with my new mixer, but was a little disappointed when it arrived. I think for over $20 they should have put a few more cents of plastic into it. Very thin and I am sure it would break if accidently droped. You think of plastic as being strong but this is a very stiff thin feel, like thin glass. I will be very careful with it forsure. Fits perfect and works great, just wonder about it's duability."
3,Poor sizing guide,"According to the sizing guide here, I was supposed to purchase a 1-piece Pouring Shield; but when I received it, the pamphlet from KitchenAid stated that I should have purchased a two piece shield. I have a Pro Series 6 Bowl Lift Mixer and this piece technically fits on it, but its kind of loose and ill-fitting. I'm not thrilled with it, but I've decided it fits well enough to warrant keeping versus paying return shipping for an exchange. If it fit better I would give it a 5 star rating because it really does effectively keep 'dusty' products from going everywhere."
3,DIDN'T FIT MY 4 1/2 QUART BOWL,"There's really nothing wrong with the KitchenAid pouring shield. I'd have loved it if it had fit. But there's so many models of KitchenAid mixers out there, no matter where I went to find out if this pouring shield would fit my mixer, the only thing I had to rely on was the product description that said it fit 4 1/2 to 5 quart bowls. I have a 4 1/2 quart bowl, model #K45, a model # I was unable to locate even through KitchenAid."
4,Good,I like it when you are pouring something in the mixer. But it does want to slid off sometimes. But I would buy another one if I had to.
4,bit large,"I have a 5qt. kitchenAid pro 5 and it doesn't clip on, it sits on. It's fine because after reading all the reviews and looking it up on Kitchen Aid this is the one that goes to it. Over all it works!"
1,Not for professional 6000 HD,Doesn't work for the kitchenaid professional 6000 HD. The lip of this bowl is cuved outward so the guides for the shield won't clip.Called kitchenaid to find out if there is a shield for this model. They apologized and stated that this is a new model and that there is no pouring shield for this bowl.
2,Yup. I got the wrong size too.,"I love Kitchenaid mixers, but I must say that ordering accessories for them is really difficult. It is so confusing which ones go with which mixers. I am having to return a dough hook and a pouring sheild b/c they don't fit. What a pain. I see that many others have had the same problem. It's no clearer on the KitchenAid website than it is on here. Do your research!"
1,Does not workr,It frequently falls off the bowl and it does not work. My dough can still blow out during a high speed mix. DO NOT BUY
3,Ok cover,"It doesn't really fit well, but it helps keep the flour from spilling out all over as it did when there was none to use."
2,Disappointing - barely usable,"Even though I purchased the correct size and type of chute for my stand mixer (also KitchenAid brand, so no cross-brand issues), this component fits poorly. The method of attachment to the bowl is a series of small plastic clips. If you don't have it fully attached with all clips, it tends to want to pop off while you're using the spout. If you break even one of these delicate clips, you also can not get it to stay in place. Finally, if you bump the chute with a bowl, no matter how minor, the clips are not sturdy enough (even with all of them intact and fully secured) to hold the chute on the bowl and allow you to continue to use the chute. It becomes dislodged and then moves periously close to the spindle as the mixer is on. This is such a poor implementation of a basic design that you are better off not wasting your money."
3,"Works well, but doesn't fit well","Works great and my wife loves it, but it doesn't fit the bowl. I'm not sure if it is the style of bowl (ours has a flared top), but the cover doesn't lock in place. It still does the job and my wife says it makes adding ingredients easier."
1,kitchenaid shield,i bought this for my wifes kitchenaid artisian 5qt.it did not fit i had to jam it on to work and it flys off when she lifts the mixer upthey said it would fit 4.5 and 5 qt it does not. i saw the 6qt in store and it fits nicely around the one there.so i am not happy.
3,"Eh - It's helpful, but not a must have","I love baking, and probably use my kitchen-aid at least once a week. I thought this was cool, it came with the unit when I bought it. But, it's more of a hassle.Positives: It does help contain the excess ""Powder"" than can sometimes poof up when mixing. You easily solve that by gradually putting in the dry mixture on a low speed.Negatives: It's in the way. I can pour much easier without. I've used it for dry and wet ingredients. Not really impressed.It's not completely useless or defective, I just don't find it to be a necessity."
4,Don't worry if it doesn't seem to fit at first,"When I first tried to fit this thing onto my Kitchen Aide mixer, I thought I'd got the wrong one because it seemed to be too small, but I tried again later and it fit. It's a pretty exact fit, so if you've ever had one that you could sort of flop on there, don't be surprised that this one isn't like that."
1,No fit. I have the Pro model 6000 HD w/9.5 curved lip bowl. .,This is my 2nd try. Thought I had it right this time. Read all the reviews. Now I see a new review stating Kitchenaid does not make a chute for my Pro model 6000 HD. Amazon & Kitchenaid need to get together & fix this mass confusion. A chart showing all the model #s & correct parts would be a big help.
3,Not a great fit,"Doesn't fit on the bowl perfectly. I set it on as best i can, and it works ok,, but it should rest easily within both sides of the bowl. Also,with the bigger bowl, the chute really isn't necessary."
3,"Did not fit, sure it's great.",I was disappointed that this did not fit the 6qt bowl for the Professional Series Kitchen Aid. Other than that I am sure it would have worked GREAT.
2,Don't Bother,It doesn't fit snugly and it only blocks a small amount of things flying out. It's easier just to adjust the speed of the mixer while adding ingredients.
2,DId not fit my bowl! No clear chioce for one that does fit. Am I getting a refund for my return?,Did Not FIt my Bowl ! No clear choice for ordeing one that does fit. I have returned it. Thank you
1,Think they sale more that are the wrong size....than the right!,"Husband bought as a gift........wrong size. Based on the other reviews this must be for a very uncommon size. I have several bowls, and this top is huge!"
1,Flour is flying everywere,The Shield is useless. As it as an opening on the rear where the kitchenaid is. Which means that all flour is flying out of the bowl at that point.....
2,right fit - waste of time & money,"I have the 5 quart & it fit fine. However, I finally took mine to Goodwill for someone who 'believes' this is a needed item. Now I'm just more careful about how I turn my mixer on so everything does not fly out. It was a pain to store and a pain to fit it on and a pain to clean. I don't miss it at all."
3,KITCHENAID 'PROFESSIONAL 6' Anybody?,"I have a Kitchenaid 'PROFESSIONAL 6' stand mixer [not the tilting type]. I know that it's called a 'PROFESSIONAL 6' because that's what it says on the mixer itself ['6,' not 600].Nowhere in these ads for 1 piece pouring shields is the name of my mixer mentioned. I cannot find it listed on Kitchenaid's web page either.Can someone help me please? I have a two piece pouring shield and would like to replace it.Thanks."
5,couldn't live without it!,I am one of those cooks that can make a mess in a heartbeat!! This has been a great protector in saving my messes
1,wrong wrong wrong,"item was described wrong and ended up not fitting our kitchenaid version. had to get another, and basically wasted our money because it did not fit our model as it was described to"
3,Not a necessity,"I bought this to use with my new Kitchen Aid mixer because my two little boys like to ""help"" when I'm baking. The shield does not fit snug on the bowl so it's always moving aroung. It is still useful when my little helpers are cooking with me. But when I am cooking by myself I don't use it because it's a bigger hassle than it's worth."
5,Call Amazon if you got the wrong size,"I called Amazon and told them the description is not clear, as my husband also ordered me this, not realizing it wouldn't fit my particular mixer. They sent me a prepaid mailing label via email. Thank you Amazon for fixing this."
2,"Great idea, so so execution","I bake daily, and was looking for a way to keep my work area neater. Eliminating flour splash out, etc from my KA Pro 5+ stand mixer would be a great move toward that goal. The problem is that the chute is too narrow, and too short for my needs. It takes longer to incorporate the flour, and spills are actually more likely. The pouring shield is well constructed, and the cost was not prohibitive."
3,not as good as the earlier 2 piece pouring shield,"Over 8 years ago, when I purchased my KA stand mixer, the pouring shield was still 2 pieces. That shield covered the entire rim of the bowl (similar to the 1 piece design, but with the opening being for the pouring chute to attach to). This helped produce less splatter on the actual KA as well. This new 1 piece design leaves the 'neck' of the KA stand mixer more exposed to splatter. The new design is okay, but I wish they offered the older 2 piece design again. --The older design was worth the 2nd step to align the pouring chute."
1,misleading,"Even though this was the first item that came up when I searched for KN1PS it is NOT the KN1PS model. It is the KN256PS, which is for the 6 quart bowls not the 4.5-5 quart bowls that the KN1PS fits."
1,Unusable,Not stated that it only fits 6 qt. bowls.Can't be adjustedwould not recomend it to anybody to buy
2,didn't fit,"I thought all kitchenAids were made of a standard size, I ordered one that was so much bigger than mine, I must have been wrong. So disappointed. Should have checked out it size first.."
2,It works...kind of,"The shield does not fit my Kitchenaid mixer bowl. If I attach it to the bowl VERY CAREFULLY, I can bend it so that it will stay as long as I keep a hand (or sometimes two) on it, but otherwise it just falls off."
2,Not for lefties,I bought this awhile ago and I hardly ever use it.It's basically useless for a lefty pour due to where the opening in the shield must sit.I wish I had saved the money to buy some other attachment for my kitchenaind since I don't use it and it tastes up a bit of space
3,It isn't perfect but...,"I did have to do some digging before I figured out which kitchenAid pouring shield I needed to fit my mother's KitchenAid Professional 5 plus series (model no. KV25G0X). This pouring shield DOES fit HOWEVER if you are looking for something that completely hugs around the lip of the bowl this is not it. This product rests gently on the rim held on my 3 little feet (you can see them in the picture).I am disappointed in KitchenAid for not making more model-specific pouring shields that securely snap on. Which is a poor design on their part because 2 sizes don't fit all. However, it does the job and the plastic it's made of it thick and sturdy and in my opinion is worth the $7 charged here, but I would not buy this product for the retail $25-$30 I've seen it other places. Hope this helps others!"
3,Check model numbers carefully: For 6 quart size only,I am very disappointed in that I looked all over for this product and when it arrived in my home I found that it did not work on my model. My model was not listed in any of the chute covers posted and as the letters started similarly thought this one might work. Return is not worth shipping cost so I am taking the loss in cash.
5,Works,"Bought for my wife. It fits perfectly into our Professional 5-Plus. 'nuff said. (There's a large gap where stuff could spill out, but doesn't seem to be a problem)"
1,Not for the 90th Anniv. model!,"I have a beautiful 90th anniversary kitchen aid mixer and this shield DOES NOT FIT! It must be because it is a thick glass bowl and not some thin metal bowl. Plus there is a big gap in the back and flour flys out all over the place, whats the point? I'll just continue using a large sheet of saran wrap and make my own sheild, very little mess that way."
1,"I agree, great if it fit",I love my kitchen aid mixer and thought the pouring shield would be a smart idea to own. Wished I had not spent the money on it. It does not really help other than to reduce the amount of flour flying out of the bowl.
3,Kitchenaid pour shield,"This is a GREAT product but is not for my mixer. When I purchased this item I could not tell from the description which series it is for so I bought it with the thought I could give it to my mother who has two mixers. So that's what I did. Great product but needs a layman description. I don't know what size my bowl is but I do know what series I have. This s for the mixer that you raise, not the one with the locking bowl."
2,I wish I didn't!!,"I bought this item hoping to prevent the mess on my counter when I'm putting ingredients into the bowl. But, it did not fit on my kitchenAid Classic. So, I ended up with even more mess. The only advantage is when I'm mixing something that tends to splash. It prevents the splashing which is a plus."
1,HORRIBLE,IT DOESN'S SECURE TO ANYTHING IT JUST SITS THERE AND ITS ABOUT A MILLIMETER TOO BIG SO EVERYTHING STILL FLYS OUT OF THE MIXER BUT NOW YOU HAVE TO CLEAN ONE MORE THING
1,Wrong size,"They don't do a very good job of saying what this piece fits on. I was under the impression it was for the 4-quart bowl, but it actually fits the 5-quart bowl. I didn't even get to use it."
1,KitchenAid 1-Piece Pouring Shield with Wide Chute,"Although the item was stated to fit my KitchenAid Stand Mixer, it did not fit at all. I can balance the shield on the rim of the bowl but it does not snap onto the bowl as indicated."
3,KitchenAid 1-Piece Pouring Shield with Wide Chute,This ended up not fitting my KitchenAid. I thought I ordered the right one but I guess not. I'm sure it would work great on a machine that it was meant to be used on.
1,size/length does matter...,"The pouring spout on the top of this shield is not long enough to reach the ""out"" spout of the grinder/food mill/strainer.Massive fail on the part of the KitchenAid research and development team."
3,Wrong Size,"I ordered the splash guard for my Kitchen Aid Stand Mixer. The information I read was not clear on the model that the part fit and when I received it, it was too large for my bowl. The shipper accepted the return and refunded me except for the shipping both ways."
2,Bad execution,"While the shield does protect the baker from splatters, the open ended one piece design means that the machine gets COVERED by whatever it is that you are mixing. Wish they had a 2 piece for the six quart."
2,"States the model not the ""size""","Okay, I realize maybe I should compare the model number to the model number, but the standard KitchenAid mixer is the 4.5 quart and this item was not explanatory in terms of size. So it is partly my fault that I didn't MAKE SURE that this item was for my 4.5 quart standard KitchenAid Mixer, but I assumed because it didn't state otherwise, it was also for the standard size.This shield is for a 6+ quart mixing bowel not the standard 4.5-5 quart bowel. This does not fit my mixer and as another person said, they are not interested in refunding anything for shipping. So it's more prudent of me to either buy another bowel or give this away as a gift; otherwise I spend the cost of the shield in shipping without the benefit of the shield."
1,NOT KN1PS Don't be mislead. Fits only 6 qt mixers,"I tried to carefully read the product information and reviews before ordering a pouring chute. I got the wrong one for my mixer. I'm going to Bed, Bath and Beyond, brick & morter, to purchase another pouring chute so I get it right this time. The Amazon info just isn't clear enough. I failed to mention that I had to get the 3B assistant manager to special order the pouring chute for my mixer--a 5 qt."
3,doesn't fit 4 1/2 qt bowl,there was no size listed for this and it is for a 5 qt. bowl not a 4 1/2 qt. bowl.
2,pouring shield,"This would be a bunch better if it snapped on the bowl. It just sits on top of it. To bad, because otherwise this would be a great item."
1,Junky,THis is just a cheap piece of plastic. I cannot believe that this is actually a kitchen aide product. It's not worth returning.
1,Wrong Size,Buyer beware. This will not fit a standard mixer. No where in the product description does it state that. Trickery!
5,Awesome part,I just received the shield for my kitchen aid stand mixer. I used it as I made bread. It worked well.
1,An Exercise in Self-Loathing,"I thouroughly despised this book. I bought it based purely on the five-star reviews here on amazon. Coming to the last page was the one pleasure this work of fiction delivered.The main character, Joseph Aeiou, was so depraved and disgusting I could barely keep going. My negative opinion of this book solidified somewhere around page 30 where Joseph is found sitting in his filthy living room with his pants down eating a brick of cream cheese.This novel was like a joke that is supposed to be funny but just doesn't work. Or it was sad but I disliked the main character so much i just didn't care what kind of problems he submerged himself in."
5,Indispensible,"If you are a student of theology, Western history of almost any sort, church-state relations, sociology of religion, philosophy of religion, or are just a mad autodidact, you already have this book. All primary sources, and fascinating reading for any occasion. If it played a role in the formation of Western theology and political-ecclesiological development, it is in this small book. There is information in this book you don't even know that you are missing, so look at it this way: church histories are necessary and very important, but wouldn't you like to read the same documents the historians are reading, and draw your own conclusions? An essential tool for professors, students, pastors, and educated Westerners of all stripes."
3,detailed reference,"This book is a good ""topic reference"" book. It is compiled of many original source writings. It is used in my seminary history class to supplement the main history text. A very good source for many topics."
4,Excellent resource.,I needed this for a couse I am taking and it is meeting all my expectations. I am pleased with this book which I use as a reference.
2,Too Much Proof-texting,"While Bettenson includes a great deal of information in this work, the fact remains that far too much of the sources that he employs rely too heavily upon proof-texting to provide any remotely serious level of scholarship with enough context to use the materials that he provides. The concept is nice, but the application is lacking."
3,Documents of the Christian Church,"The copy I received was several years older than the current (1999) publishing date, but ancient history doesn't change."
4,Documents of the Christian Churcch,This book arrived promptly and was in the condition described. The text was unblemished while the cover was slightly worn. The book serves my purposes and I'm quite pleased with it.
2,Needs page numbers,I got this for an online class and it's totally useless because it doesn't tell me the page numbers. So now I own it and can't use it cause of the sectioned reading. Other then that I haven't even read it. too busy
5,Curiosity killed the cat,"thats what I was thinking when I first saw this CD and deciding whether to buy it or not. A cuban piano player and a gypsy flamenco singer NAAA I don't think it's gonna work,I bought it any way..... I was familar with most of the songs Inolvidable, Lagrimas Negras and had heard them done by other artists many times. but this combination works and what is created is a haunting beautiful version of a song that will change you forever because these are the versions of the songs that will stick in your mind forever and when you hear them again being done by other arists they will not have that special tragic magic that will haunt you forever..... No other version of Lagrimas Negras will ever be good enough to compare....curiosity almost killed the cat but the magic in this CD will surely bring any cat back to life.."
5,Lagrimas Negras,"Goosebumps! A masterpiece. A beautiful mix Of Afro Cuban, Spanish, and Brazilian songs intertwined with a most soulful Gipsy-flamenco style of vocal. Both Bebo and El Cigala are masters at their craft that give more depth to the classic songs than they originaly had. It's holy!Rafael Vigil"
2,Not for Me,"Aside from the fine quality of the musicianship all around on this CD, it's not for me. I really can't stand the juxtoposition of the two main styles- Cuban bolero and Spanish flamenco. For me, bolero calls for such sweet melancholy, and flamenco singing does not evoke that: in this mix it just sounds tortured. Kudos for the effort, always worth trying, but to me it's not listenable. And most critics and audiences disagree with me anyway!"
2,yawnacious,"if you loved the buena vista social club you'll likely cream for these two too. what they are doing is ok for what it is but there's nothing ""fusion"" about it. it's simply a flamenco singer singing with an old tyme cuban ensemble. I should have known from the grammy nominations not to pay $75 to see this group at the conga room in l.a., but you know isaac delgado won a grammy and played the conga room so hope springs eternal....This nostalgic crap like the buena vista social club is only for jive birds! If you want to hear REALLY innovative music out of Cuba it's got to be TIMBA!!!! NG La Banda, Charanga Habanera, Bamboleo, Paulito FG, Carlos Manuel y su Clan and above all KLIMAX!!!! Music of the 21st century awaits you in Cuba!!!"
5,beautiful music,"Lagrimas Negras is one of the greatest albums of all time, you can not imagine how great this combination of a Cuban piano player (Bebo Valdez R.I.P) with a Spanish flamenco singer (Diego Cigala)sounds until you hear it.I love jazz music and its actually my favorite style of music, but this innovation of music its just great, and the lyrics of the songs are beautiful too.I saw the Lagrimas Negras Concert in the Auditorio Nacional of México, and i can tell you that it was the best performance i've ever seen in my life, in fact i cried with the ""Vete de mi"" song, i hope that Diego Cigala continues the history of this great music with Bebo's son ""Chucho"" Valdez, bacause finally someone is making something different and beautiful."
4,excellent.,"Good songs, mostly excellent, There is not a song on this that I do not like, But after awhile, they all started to sound a bit the same."
5,Me encanto,"Para el que le guste algo diferente como una mezcla de el son cubano y el flamenco se lo recomiendo. El Cigala canta con mucho sentimiento y Bebo ejecuta con mucho sabor, aunque con la edad falla algunas notas al piano, pero no deja de ser envolvente y los arreglos musicales a mi parecer de alta calidad."
2,There is something wrong with this game,"P4 2.0radeon 9700512 MB of RAMRoad Runner Cable ModemThis game will not run on my system at anywhere near an acceptable frame rate, even turned down to 800X600. My system is not bleeding edge, but well above the minimum specs.I tried the Far Cry Demo, which has just as much foliage, and it runs just fine.I bought this on the strength of BF 1942 and am very disappointed. How sad."
5,This is the game that has dominated my life,"I usually don't write reviews but since I was here, I figured I should write one on the game that I play night and day. This game is unreal and a lot of fun. With the ability to drive tanks, shoot mortar, put down bouncing betties, fly F-4s, this has a play style for everybody. It's an addictive game!"
2,Battlefield Vietnam.......,"I bought this game because I loved Battlefield 1942.One of the major problems with Battlefield 1942 was the single player.. it was boring and the bots were just plain stupid. I had my hopes up that the single player would improve in Battlefield: Vietnam but it didn't. The bots are still as stupid as they were in Battlefield 1942.However, the muliplayer is just as bit good or better then Battlefield 1942... its just a little buggy. If you bought Raven Shield when it first came out you know what I mean. They released this game before it was ready to be released just so it could reach a release deadline. So expect tons of patches for this game.One of the wierdest (and backward) things about this game that the graphics seem better on low then they do on high... and the game runs better. (I'm running a GeForce FX 5200)(...)."
3,BFV,"This game is fun if, you can find a server that doesnt lag and thats impossible and you have a top of the line system that would run doom 3 easily its not very optimzed and it can get very choppy for a very long time. I have a 2.8 gig p4 with HT and a 9800 pro 128 with 512 RAM dual channel and i get choppyness with a low resoulution and strpped down high graphics (lightmaps, shadows and menu music off)"
1,"Looks decent, but read the fine print on the box!","This game appears to be good, but unfortunately, after purchasing it, I was shocked to find out that it will not run. If you buy this, and have anything less than a Radeon 8500 chip, it will not run. Thus, I had to buy a new video card (A GeForce 5200 Ultra). This makes the game playable, but considering that I have a decent computer system (Athlon 2400+, 768MB) and I still cannot play the game on the medium settings without choppy graphics. Any higher setting makes the game simply unplayable. Great game if you have a very high end video card and a fast processor however."
5,AWSOME GAME!,"Forget those bad reviews. As a hardcore bf player, BF veitnam and BF 2. This game is very realistic! Ground combat just gets your blood going and Helicopter dogfights, OUT OF THIS WORLD! If you get in a F4-phantom vs. mig dogfight it will blow your mind how much fun! Online is AWSOME! You actually have to plan and use guerella warfare! once i was fight a guy online in a building. he ran behind a wall to avoid my AKMS. I expected him to just run from behind it but then he jumped out really fast and I almost reached the moon! LOL. anyway... Very fun game. buy it for addicting gameplay. Also try out BF2 and BF2142 (BF1942 is kinda boring, not many weapons)."
4,Overall very good,"Being a Vietnam vet, I enjoy this game very much albeit I was a sailor so did not see the landbased combat. Graphics are overall very good but a little dated - shows the growth in the BF series. Have trouble controlling the aircraft - the single player maps are a little resrictive. Also, have somewhat mastered helo ops but have had the helo move in reverse from what keys were being used causing a crash. Don't know if this is related to my bluetooth keyboard. Have not tried to use a helo with FAng yet."
2,This game stinks!,"This game is lame. The graphics are poor. But the worst part is the temporary freezes. My computer meets or far exceeds the requirments listed in the game information but is unable to make this game work. My video card is the exact card listed on the box,the drivers are up to date. The fact is this game just does not work."
4,Multiplayer Fun,"The individual solo games are fun, but it is the multiplayer that makes this game. You can snipe opponents from the brush, lay down and they cannot see you. Booby trap vehicles, there is so much to do and the maps are so huge. Helicopters are difficult to control, but very effective. Ho Chi Minh trail has awesome graphice detail, as do most of the scenarios. The sound is really awesome with the anti war PA announcements flooding the area. Overall, lots of fun."
3,Good but not Great,i gave this game 3 of 5 for a couple of reasons. the gameplay is the same for the most part as BF1942 and the graphics are better. the ai is fairly decent as long as u customize it and put the bots up. some people on here are complaining that it slows down your computer than obviously your computer is crap. i have an alienware area51 extreme this is why it doesnt suck. if your PC meets minimal requirements DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. if your computer exceeds the requirements you will have no problems so BUY THIS GAME. it is full of action with vietnam era songs weapons and realistic terrain. the music is outstanding on the loading screens and the online play is outstanding. everything on this game is good but not great and if u like war games you will like this
3,Vietnam's BF1942,"I was so excited to get this game, I was ready for a whole new game from EA.I was really disappointed when I got it. It is Battlefield 1942 with a few improvements:1) You can see how long it will take for the flag to change2) It uses a ""3D Map"", basically it marks all your allies on the screen for you so there's less friendly fire3) You can shoot out of vehicles4) You can play music in vehicles5) New weapons and vehicles.If you have Battlefield 1942, think long and hard about buying this. It isn't bad, it's just not that much better than BF1942.If you don't have BF1942 and would like a superb 1st person shooter, this is the one for you."
2,Disappointing,"Very disappointing, specially coming from the guys at EA who created the Medal of Honor series. The original Battlefield was original and fun to play, but very low quality graphics and play control. Battlefield Vietnam is no better, just different weapons and maps, they may have updated the engine a bit, but the game runs slow and is prone to bugs. I bought Battlefield Vietnam hoping that it would be much better then the original, but I was disappointed. There is another one coming out, but I think I will wait awhile before buying that one."
1,A Complete Waste of Money,"I've been playing computer games for almost 15 years and this one ranks as a tremendous disappointment. I have several problems with this game. First, the AI is ridiculous--completely unbelievable. Second, I lived through this time period (joined the Air Force at the tail end of the fighting), and this game doesn't capture the feel of it. I've spent a great deal of time studying the war and found many details of this game so historically inaccurate as to be laughable. Also, even on my high-end machine the graphics looked cheesy. The bottom line is I uninstalled this game after one week. If you're looking for a game with a high immersion factor that keeps you coming back for more, save your money and look elsewhere!"
2,same old game,"I had big hopes for this one. I started getting a little bored with 1942 and Desert Combat (AFTER 1 YEAR). They were awesome and hold the record for most time on my PC. This game did not renew any of the previous enjoyment. I am sure those that didnt play 1942 will be satisfied. Basically, I was looking for something new...look, feel, sound, gameplay...something. I just didnt find it with BF Vietnam."
4,This was great!!!!,"I recently got this game,it ROCKED! I will never have so much fun on Call of Duty anymore. I hope you have the same experience. It is recommended for people who like flying Huey Gunships over a tall mountain."
2,This game sucks. What were they thinking?,"If you expect a first person shooter along the lines of Call Of Duty or Vietcong...forget it. If you have a video card other than Nvidia...forget it. If you seek smooth, logical gameplay...forget it. As a previous reviewer noted, there is definitely something wrong with this game. Movement is awkward and laggy, even at low resolutions. The single player games are pure confusion. The voice-overs and load time will drive you nuts. There is no keyboard reference sheet, and there are at least 50 commands to memorize and use. Land, sea, and air movements require different control setups. The game is bug-infested and the bottom line is...this game sucks."
4,Lying EA Tech. Advisers,"Bought this version 1.1 2004 Battlefield Vietnam game cause I liked it when it first came out in 2004. Then found I couldnt get on any servers, Kept saying, Need Updates, Wound you like to update, When you press""YES"" it does nothing, So I called EA to find out why. They Lied and said I needed Battlefield Bad Co 2, so I bought that too. Didnt help the problem. THEN I discovered all I needed was the current patches for the servers to come up. And the patches are FREE downloads. Now Im happily killing enemy soldiers left and right. DONT TRUST EA. they will lie to you just to get you to buy their products. And their customer service just sucks outright. So if you buy this game, just go online and get the free download patches, Then go to the (HELLO) Clan servers here in North America, so I can kick your A$$. HeHeHe, Happy gaming, hope this helped"
3,"Not for me, but for the era, it was probably OK","This is an old game and the graphics are very poor compared to new games. If you like the Vietnam era and want to go relive it, I guess it will be good for you. I was in that era and the game brings back memories, but it's not really a fun game."
2,i recommand ut 2004 instead of this.,"get unreal tournament 2004 instead of this crap.this game is buggy, poor graphic and the machine guns are just too powerful. on the other hand, unreal tournament 2004 got very balanced weapons that actualy requires skill to shoot."
5,Difference between EODand BFVietnam,The difference between EOD and BFVietnam is:Better GraphicsYou can airlift tanks and jeepsNAPALMnot so many errors because i tried to play EOD and it wouldn't workdoesn't require BF1942and well there are so many better things about this game
2,Doesnt meet the standards,UI is really poor. Production value is incredibly bad. Weapon balance is bad. Game play is terrible. They scored big with the Invasion of the Philipines map and raised the bar of expectation. Battlefield Vietnam is an incredible letdown to a huge fan of BF1942.
1,SOOOOOOO BAD!!!!!,"Bought this game with great expectations only to be terribly disappointed. This game is absolutely horrid!!! It is not even in the same league as Far Cry. The the missions suck, the gameplay sucks, the interface sucks and even the graphics suck on a 5900 Ultra. PacMan on an Atari is better than this."
2,Fun but lame,"The issue of bugs has been beaten to death. I have a good system and I found that I couldn't go for the best graphics, but I didn't have to settle for the worst. It is buggy, but I lack the technical sophistication to argue whether it is my fault or the game's fault.I was indignant and horrified that the gooks have choppers and armored vehicles. The game creators made bold pretenses with their dubious history lessons before each singleplayer level, then they insult the player's intelligence. The point should be that the VC can beat the US with numbers, skill and ingenuity. The game makers made BF Vietnam into a farce. This is BF 1942 to a '60's soundtrack with assault rifles instead of Garands and MP 40's.By the way, this is nothing like real combat. It is a fun shoot-em-up type game and nothing more."
3,Not much to it,"At first, I thought this game was the best I've played in a long time! After a few day and playing both sides to the limited number of fields you can play I realized.... this game isn't all that great! Game speed goes from great to lag in no time, problem when your getting fired at when attempting to snipe. Also, the enemy will just ""fall from the sky"" even after you clear a zone. It would be different if I failed to clear a spot but hey, what do you do! My biggest complaint is the AI in the game. Funny story. I call for a helicopter pickup...well after a minute of the pilot trying to figure out where it is were needed, he bails in mid-air for no reason cauing me and the 4 guys I was with to plummit to the ground...dead on impact. Even better when you jump gunner on a jeep and all he does is drive into a tree...Anyhow, fun game at first! Needs more fields, better AI. Great sound, great visuals!"
1,"Boring, slow","I am sorry. This was a big waste of money. Long load times, I mean really long. After hearing the same music over and over again I began to just turn off the sound. Why I cannot use a joystick for the flying mode is a good question since were in the year 2004! and I am still using arrow keys? Reminds me of my Commodore VIC20! There are so many better choices. Call of Duty plays just fine on my computer and the multiplay is outstanding when compared to this play-station arcade game. Repeat, I will never buy an EA game again because of this. DO NOT WASTE 40 dollars on this Salvation Army donation. Thats where mine is going. I can use the tax break and learn a lesson"
4,GREAT ONLINE GAME,"This is probably my fsvorite online multiplayer game so far. There are lot's of levels which are huge. You can have up to 64 people on a server.There are lot's of weapons including bazookas, machine guns, pistols, mortars, rifles, knifes, bombs etc. There are also traps you can set on the ground like spikes and others.There are also a lot of vehicles. Tanks, scooters, jeeps, planes, helicopters. You can get up to like 5 people on one vehicle.There is only a two minor problems. It gets laggy sometimes and it takes a while to get onto a server. Almost four minutes.You get to listen to music while your drivin vehicles and that's cool. Songs I always play are songs are ""Wild Thing"" and ""Surfin Bird"". There are like 20 songs all together.Still this is a great game for anyone thats a fan of war games and just good non-stop multiplayer action."
2,dissapointed,thought this game would be fun but it really wasn't. lots of bugs really drag the experience. im running an AMD Athlon 64 3200+ with a GeForce 5900XT and im getting white lines while playing the game. could be a driver problem though. i'll find out tonight. the game is often choppy for some reason. maybe the game would be fun if there werent so many bugs. better luck next time EA
4,Best War Game available,1942 was the best war game for a while and now Vietnam is which makes it an outstanding game. There isn't a tremendous amount of improvements but the game didn't need a whole lot of improvement in the first place. Still a blast to play with improved guns and maps and everything else but don't expect anything mind bendingly awesome as far as changes. You'll need a fairly high-end machine to run this game smoothly so if you don't have one then you should look at something else. 1942 fans and FPS fans in general should have a great time playing this game.
2,Nothing Original,"Ok first off don't buy this game if you already own other Battlefield titles. The game does not add enough features to be enjoyable for Battlefield fans. To those who are new I'd give you the thumbs up to buy it. Although it is a little buggy (Not as much as others would have you believe) the developers are already working on a new patch. The main feature is the vehicles with the same concept of BF42 except you can airlift vehicles in. Trust me it isnt as cool as it sounds. First off, 70% of players can't fly the helos, 2nd, it takes about a minute to hook a vehicle, and finally, the Vietcong will blow it away as soon as you land. Overall, I'd say this game is not good enough for a standalone title and perhaps you should consider buying Battlefield:42, but if you have you're heart set on it, you're gonna be a little dissapointed."
1,"Don't bother. Wait for the patched, Gold Edition.","This *looks* like it would be a wonderful game. Really.Unfortunately, the hardware this game needs to run on is not so much 'top of the line', as other reviews claim, as it is just plain limited.EA simply hasn't gotten this one ready yet. I suppose it's another indication of the pressure to release games, instead of taking the time to get it right. For example, the sound hardware supported is SoundBlaster or nothing. Have an nforce2 board? Forget 5.1 sounds. Have a Quadro4, or FireGL graphics card? Sorry, we didn't test them.In short, if you don't have a Dell Dimension Desktop, this game will underperform, and currently has a number of hideous bugs which make the game unplayable. Extremely disappointing, I was really looking forward to this one. Save your money."
1,Huge Dissapointment,"I bought this for $50.00 (when it was just released) and loved how it was team based. It had a lot of potential but so many bugs. Like many others, I eagerly anticipated the patch to fix these bugs. Patch was released and caused even more problems. Now the game crashes constatnly during online gameplay. I use to play this game daily. Now, I haven't touched it for about a month. Bought Farcry instead and play it's great singleplayer mode. I use to have so much loyalty to EA games, they've produced so many great games that I still enjoy (such as the Total War line, Command and Conquer, Madden, NBA Live, etc.) but their support for this game really left me feeling bitter and burned. They treat their customers like (...). Take my advice and do not waste your money on this game. I recommend Farcry (if your system's video card is above average, although I use a Geforce FX 5200, I can play fine in low settings and it still looks great). Hope this helped."
3,Good game but not as fun as BF1942,I have been playing since the day of release. It is only an ok game. EA released it too early and it was very imbalanced. The maps are too small and I hate the way you seem to always spawn in front of your enemy not to mention there are too many people that get in the choppers and can just dominate the game. My other complaint with this game is that there are too few maps. Half the maps are just copys of other maps set in different time zones yet about the same. Those are the things I like least about the game.I do like the way you compete for flags in this game. This is an improvement over BF1942. All in all it is just an ok game and there is nothing really ground breaking in it. I will not be buying the expansions for this one when they come out.
2,"Some potential, but too buggy to be a serious contender","From the get-go, this game never ran properly on then cutting-edge ATI hardware. Antialiasing always produced an artifacting effect on my 9700 pro, and anisotropic filtering had no perceptible image enhancement. Moreover, the game was marred by subpar performance on my 3.2 ghz, 9700 pro system, producing an average of about 40FPS at 1024x768 resolution. I wrote these initial problems off as EA pushing to get this game out the door. But after the game update and several driver updates from ATI, I still get the same issues as when I bought the game in March. Be cautious and check some forums before you purchase this, or else you might be in for a disappointment."
2,"Great multiplayer, but singleplayer sucks!","I must agree with everyone, IT SUCKS!Alot, and I mean a lot of bugs in the game.When it first came out, I thought this is gonna be the best.But was I wrong.The only good thing in the game is the graphics, and multiplayer.Wait when the price goes down, then buy it, and play only multiplayer cause thats the best.I am realy disipointed at this game, and they could have done better, a lot better!Hope this helped. :-)"
5,Great Game,A blast of a game to play multiplayer. Got this game on March 16th and all I can say is wow. Huge improvement graphically over BF1942 in my opinion and the online play is just as fun. The soundtrack to the game is awesome and sounds great when your in a tank driving thru burned out buildings killing Vietcong. The jets and choppers give the game the Desert Combat feel with the Vietnam era. The game has a few issues out of the box but no show stoppers and I'm sure all will be settled with a patch or two. Worth every penny if you enjoy these types of games!
3,(-(-_(-_-)_-)-) |3attlefield VietCong !!!,"Offline play is not so fun. Played it through 2 maps just to get the hang of some vehicle and weapons. Graphics are not as good as Americas Army (completely free game). However, Online play is exciting. Helicopters and jets make for a fun battle. Seems like lots of time is spent searching for the fight though. If there's not lots of players, you may find yourself running across the map 80% of the time. The only other bad part that comes to mind is the chat doesnt work while the next maps are loading. So inbetween each round your stairing at some loading screan and cant talk to your squad and opponents. All these bugs aside, i'll be online making war for many days to come. Still a fun game. Hope it helps, b-real DataCypher"
2,"Buggy, Laggy, not finished yet","Put simply, this game gets old fast and is very laggy no matter what you do in the options menu. Maybe with a really good patch it will turn out okay. I play BF1942 and Desert Combat and I love them both (especially single player), but this was a disappointment. Wait for a patch and more reviews before buying.My Computer:Falcon Northwest P4 3.0 Ghz1 GB RamATI Radeon 9800 Pro 256MB graphics cardAudigy II Sound Card100 GB 7200 RPM Western Digital Hard DisksPromise RAID ControllerAll the lastest driversWinXP (Current and up-to-date)"
2,Fun if.........,"You like to run around and shoot things? Then This game is for you. The game has no structure, no story line, and much more bull. Sorry, but the graphics aren't that great. No match for Call of Duty or the newer Delta Force games. Totally for multiplayer fans only. Don't do it."
1,Extremely disappointing,"All I ever do is get aggravated at some point when playing this game. Nothing better than shooting someone 3 times with a sniper rifle and not only do they not die, but they run full speed at you unhindered and kill you. I would say that at least 80% of the time that I die on this game it is after I shot the other person first. I ended up throwing this game in the garbage. Stick with ravenshield if you expect someone to die when you shoot them."
5,The personal Critics of this game have NO idea,"The people that have problems with there copy not working is only because they are willing to spend a little money on a state of the art game, are the people that just want something for free. If you buy the finest graphical game that is made at this moment, you must be willing to keep your computer at the same level There are cheap places with a white and blue sign that sell games for $9.99 everyday to serve your needs just fine, but if you want to hang with the big boys. Then be willing to keep up with a computer that is not purchased for $499.99. Study and find a computer that is capable of being UPGRADABLE, The most important thing to look for is can you upgrade the Memory, AGP slot for upgrading Video Car, and capable of upgrading the CPU (Processor). Then you will not have a problem PLAYING THE REAL GAMES of Technology."
2,A great concept poorly implemented,"The idea behind it is great, it does have a great intro movie, and music is top notch; However, the actual gameplay is very poor and the graphics dated. There is no point to trying to sneak around in the foliage, the only way to be successful is to charge at the enemy, die 50 times and maybe finally get through. I was bored with this game after 2 sessions and glad I borrowed it and didn't buy it. If you haven't checked out Call of Duty yet, it is a MUCH better gameplay experience, it may not have the fancy movies or music but the gameplay and graphics more than makes up for it."
3,Good but not so Good,"Here is a game that is a sequel to battlefield 1942 and I judged it by it, and that was the wrong thing to do!!! At first the game is dumb but grows on you quickly!! The graphics are so so and the music stinks, and no campaign. The helicopters are great and the tanks are more realistic and some other mods. It ends up to be a so so game that you wish you had bought the other game beside it."
3,Crash to Desktop,"Just like BF42, this game still has the same issue with random crash to desktop issues."
2,Dissapointing,"Battlefield 1942 was a great game, you could hop into vehicles like tanks,planes,and boats. It also supported 64 players and it was awesome how you could play on a team with 32 other players.All that is back in this game...BUT THEY MESSED IT UP!!!!First of all the level design gives the Americans 2x the vehicles of the NVA, and they're guns are stronger. Second of all you can go rambo and run along by your self and kill everyone so team play is never used. And last of all the vehicles aren't fun to drive anymore because you just go off a cliff or smack into a tree every 5 seconds. DON'T BUY THIS GAME BUY BATTLEFIELD 1942 INSTEAD!"
2,Where's the Bowl?,"If you're looking for a slick set of contemporary dishes that have just a hint of fun, these may be for you. They are clean looking and devoid of frou-frou with just a touch of color to keep things interesting. My only problem with them is the bowls, or rather lack thereof. The bowls included with the set are very very shallow...at first glance you wouldn't even know the bowls from the plates. They're fine for salad, but a disaster with soup or cereal."
3,I dont get how this is fun,"I bought this for my daughter and what I found in it is that it is just a bunch of random words, their meanings and an example sentence. I dont see how this is fun. There are no mnemonics or roots or origins or anything. It is just a glorified filtered dictionary with only the good words. If that is what you are looking for, then this is fine. I was looking for something where my daughter can get hooked on to because it doesnt feel like she is having to memorize these words but still learns them through other fun activity. During the SAT preparation, there are other more fun ways to learn, but if you run out of those and you got down to learning the remaining words, then this may help you. After this book I bought ""How to build a better vocabulary"" and my daughter is cruising through it with interest."
3,Sucks down batteries,"Works well, sensitivity is good given the price. Seems to eat batteries for breakfast, tho."
5,Best portable GPS out there,"I have had an E-Trex Legend for over two years. I think it is fantastic device. I use the Garmin USA topographic maps. That 8MB memory can store a lot of maps. I only use lithium batteries and the unit will run in the tracking mode for well over 15 hours. I also download to DeLorme maps on my computer. I have used the GPS in Europe twice. Although I do not have European maps, the tracks are still displayed on Garmin's mapsource software. The only downside is that the small aerial makes the unit lose signal in the mountains sometimes. I also have the Garmin mount for my mountain bike and it is great to watch speed, elevation, distance travelled and direction on one display."
3,ok out in the open,"My first GPS. Initially had some trouble with software often crashing locking up the unit. But it's works problem free since I updated the software. Which I might add is pretty straightforward. The only issue that I have with the unit is that it doesn't track well in densely wooded trails. It's performance is spotty. Eats batteries, so bring extras out on the trail. I've gotten used to it now, it's helpful not to wear the unit on your belt, but rather up on the strap of your backpack. That makes it a little more reliable. Originally, I picked it up for just for safety and it's fine for that. Though it doesn't work well enough for mapping purposes it works well enough to save way points for reference. It often looses the signal of satellites behind hills. I hope to replace it soon with a newer HIGH SENSITIVITY unit soon."
3,VERY BASIC,"We bought this for fun and it is. Moderately user friendly it is good for geocaching, but not very useful as a general GPS devise."
5,This GPS is full featured at an affordable price,"Bought this GPS as a gift, and in just 5 minutes of setup, we had already mounted it to a mountain bike and were off in search of GeoCache's. With the WAAS and its thousandth of a minute accuracy, we were able to pinpoint the location perfectly.I really liked its durable feel as well as the Indigloesque backlighting."
5,Garmin Handheld GPS,"Fantastic little GPS. We bought this to help with our Geocaching!Finding our way with it is simple and easy to learn...it sits on the dashboard perfectly.It's an adult treasure hunt ""game"". fun and exciting, we use it in conjunction with our metal detector!Go to www.geocaching.com to see what it's all about...this is not a commercial for the website just telling you what we use the Garmin GPS for.It's palm sized plus it has a lace to wear around the neck with a clip on the end to hold the GPS while walking.Recommend it for price, size, and ease of use. 5 stars from us *****"
5,Fun to use,I received the Garmin eTrex Legend as a Christmas gift. I have enjoyed using it both in my car and while walking through town. It takes a minute or so to connect with the satellites and then gives you your latitude and longitude. While driving I let it hang from my neck so that when it is safe I can check it. If it was mounted on the dashboard I wouldn't be able to read it. The mileage traveled is easily read and compares closely to what you get on the car's odometer. I have found it fun to use thus far. I need to use the instruction book to learn some additional features.
4,Garmin eTrex,"We just started Geocaching, and this little guy is very helpful in finding those hidden treasures. It doesn't suck up batteries too quickly, and the features are helpful for what we use it for."
2,The Legend is a great GPS... BUT,"I bought my Legend and used it moderately for about a year (I've changed the batteries 15+ times) and took good care of the unit when I used it. It was a great GPS. But one day I turned it on and the screen was flickering and all messed up. I immediately emailed Garmin. They were very nice and prompt but informed me that if it was more than a year since the purchase date, it could be sent in for repair for $99. It was a few months past a year, and since the original cost $152, it didn't make much sense to send it in. So now I have a GPS that I can't use. I haven't purchased another Garmin product."
4,Great entry level GPS,"I'm very pleased with the accuracy and reliability of this GPS receiver. I've had to rely on the manual more frequently than I expected to and the mapping feature really isn't very useful, but for the price I paid, it's a great unit for my primary passion - Geocaching!!"
3,ok..,"This was a gift for my daughter. She wanted something that would be easy to use, but found it difficult to operate."
4,Great Little GPS,"I bought the Legend back in 2004 and have used it on my Motorcycles and in my cars. It has never let me down, although it doesn't have the FM and Ranch Roads I ride my bike on I can easily tell where the main Highways are and never get lost. When I need a gas satation it tells me where to head. I always use it in my car when traveling. My Son also has the Legend, he lives in a large Metro area and uses it daily for navigation with no problems and really likes it. It doesn't have all the amenities of the higher dollar units but it gives alot of bang for the buck. I am very happy with mine and highly recommend it. Downside, I haven't had a serial port compatable computer in years."
3,Okay as long as you are not under trees,"I bought this to take hiking on the many pennsylvania trails. For that purpose it is absolutely useless. It just does not pick up the sattelites when you are under the cover of trees. It won't even work around my house which has many trees.I decided to keep it however because I also use it when I walk or bike around the neighborhood and for that it works just fine.One minor iritation - it takes quite a while (2-4 minutes) to pick up the satellites. This is a bit annoying as when i walk outside to start my walk or bike ride, I need to stand there and wait for it to pick up the satellites."
5,"Quality, inexpensive GPSr",Bought this for Geocaching and it is working great so far. It was reasonably priced and has good features and good performance. I just wish the maps that you can download were not so expensive (~100) - almost as much as the unit itself!
1,eTrex is not a trail model,"Very disappointing unit and I returned it immediately to purchase a a Garmin GPSMAP 60. The eTrex would not acquire *any* satellites in a wooded area in winter, no foliage. Seemed fine otherwise, but I don't think it should be marketed as a trail model. The GPSMAP 60 is super though, great sattellite acquisition and features, but costs a good bit more."
4,Very good option to start with cool features,"I had dreamt about GPS since childhood. I had seen the GPS in 10 years back in James Bond Movie-GoldenEye. since then I always wished if I could know where I am standing on Earth.E-Trex worked very fine with me. Atleast I could stop the Car and see where is 101 Freeway and I am going far or near parpendicular or parallel.I've also tried this in India, It works very nicely here. For the very first time when you start it takes time to find the satelite. but once it starts it gives the same precision. Inbuilt Maps in GPS are not perfect for India and has incorrect boundaries. I know there is not even good map-source CD available for India. I had set these expectations while buying e-trex. I am happy with waypoints and trajectory it makes. Above all it is like light weight looks like mobile."
4,Nice for the price,"I haven't bought any downloads for it, yet. (They are a little pricey) We used it as-is for a trip last month and it really came in handy. With the database that is already in it, we were able to find rest stops and resturants, etc. The only drawback was I had to hold it directly by a window for it to pick up satellite positions so when I wasn't using it, but still had it on, I had to place it on the dashboard for it to keep up with where we were going. We really like it, though."
4,Nothing More to Buy GPS,"Excellent inexpensive unit with no software to worry about dealing with or buying (but you can if you want more detailed maps with more points of interest, etc). Has services and rest areas on major interstate routes as well as major roads including alaska already programmed in. Tracks well for hiking, kayaking, or major crosscountry driving, all of which I used it for already. Interface very easy to work with. The only addition I would make would be a larger memory for more detailed trails, waterways and smaller neighborhood roads, but you can add that by buying software if you need. Not ideal for driving because most smaller roads not programmed in."
4,Does the job,"I had a previous version of the Garmin (in its old format). It was bullet proof but not really very helpful. I decided to update and this seemed to be a good compromise between just the lattitude and longitude gps and the complete ""on-star"" type system.It works well, acquires the necessary coverage much quicker than the prior unit and seems accurate and reliable.It does come only with major road coverage. While that is a great improvement over the original units, you will still need a city map unless you buy the city streets software. The software seems pricy since it is a good percentage of the price of the unit. You might be better off getting one of the models that already has the city streets software included as the overall price is probably less.However, it works, the colored screen is much easier to see and for overall knowing where you are, what decent sized roads to take to get from city to city it is a good product."
2,too much,this unit is too much to handle. my older garmin etrex vista was much easier to use and the maps weere preloaded.using this unit makes me sick.
1,DON'T BUY FOR GOING ACROSS COUNTRY,"Not big enough to store data, can take only 4 large cites!It's a waste of money. First GPS we've owned. The joystick is a little tricky for new GPS and takes some getting used to.Very sorry we bought it, first time GPS customers, if you want something for your car buy the bigger models and not the portables. We were trying to save a little dough and ended up with something we can't use.Buyer beware and get your data before buying a GPS."
3,Works Perfect BUT...,"I love the unit, it works really well. I have never been able to get the 10 foot advertised accuracy in Hawaii, but the 20 foot or so accuracy I usually get works just fine for me.My only complain is the plastic loop that the lanyard attachs to is not very strong. The unit needs to see the sky to work, so I attach the lanyard that comes with the unit to a plastic loop at the bottom of the unit and hang it around my neck. It works very well when you are walking around. The unit keeps track of your position accurately. However, the plastic loop broke off the other day from just one good jerk. I broke the weak plastic loop when I was standing up with the unit hanging around my neck and the unit get caught on the edge of the table.I will send the unit back for repair (still under warranty), but I am concern that the plastic loop will break off again..."
2,Bare bones GPS with no feature improvements in last 5 years,"I bought an Etrex legend 4 years ago, for the last 18 months I've had intermittent problems with it not working.Now it's dead.Negatives:Not very durableVery poor reception under tree cover, Magellan is better here.Bare bones map, for a good map you pay $100 more.Minimum memory, only 8 MB, so if you do buy the map, you can only puta small portion in at any given time.Comes with a serial cable, most USB to serial adapters don't workso if you don't have a serial port you have a problem.If you're using it for geocaching, you can't mark which ones have beenfound.Also the screen shows the gc.com GCxxxxx code which isn't helpful.You need to have a PDA or paper printout of all the caches preparedahead of timeDrilling down thru the menus to get to the trip computer page is a pain if there are several caches nearby & you'd like to see some info on each of them.After 5+ years Garmin should improve the features,they have done nothing."
4,Garmin eTrex,"This is my first GPS unit and I have used it for about a month. I use it mainly when kayaking on lakes to track time, distance and speed. The eTrex works great in this capacity. It handles water splashing with no ill effects. My only gripe is that it sometimes takes awhile to acquire the satellite signals and if you don't have a clear view of the sky it loses signal. The eTrex is very easy to use once all the buttons are identified. Battery life has been great. I was looking for a small, waterproof, inexpensive, easy to use GPS and the eTrex Legend does that and more. I would buy it again."
3,Garmin Legend,It's a good basic GPS but there are newer technologies and features available now for almost the same price.
4,Good beginner unit,"I would recommend this GPS for geocachers out there as a dependable hand held unit. If you want a car or truck GPS forget this product. It loses signal very easily inside anything, i.e. your vehicle. Outside with a clear view of the sky is no problem, even with overcast skies. Enjoy!"
5,Just what the doctor ordered......,"I wanted a GPS unit for hiking, biking and kayaking but did not want to spend a lot of money..Got this for around $125 and am very happy with it."
4,Garmin eTrex Legend 8mb,Just like all new gadgets the start up and usage was easy with basic functions and hard as the functions become more advanced. So far the road maps have been better than I expected. One con is that the signal is lost often.
4,Good little unit,"This is my second GPS to own. Most of the reviews will give pros and cons, most seem to be true. Overall, this is a good unit and very accurate. Don't let the cons keep you from this unit."
1,etrex failure,"This is a toy, not to be confused with a real GPS device to be used in any situation where it would realisticly be depended upon for direction or location. It consistently could not reliably pick up the signals in little or no cloud cover in Banff National Park even near peaks on a recent trip, and is useless with any substantial cloudcover. It also has cumbersome, slow software that is anything but logical. It's a waste of money and not a serious instrument."
4,Poor reception,"Given it's size and portability, I'd say this device performs well. Reception, however, can be a problem; sometimes it takes forever to lock on to satellites, sometimes it's just impossible to get a lock. This is my first GPS; if this is your first too, then it's a good buy. Otherwise, move onto something better (more accurate, better reception, more memory, faster startup). Don't be fooled by the image - YOU DON'T GET A MAP -; this device has very little memory and if you're traveling to Europe you won't be able to put much into it. I use it for orientation (North, South, East, West); if you download the coordinates of your points of interest from Google Earth and store them in memory you're ok without maps (there are parts of the world, like China, for which it's very difficult to find maps). Bottom line: Entry level GPS; not for serious trekkers or explorers, but good for travel 'aficionados'."
4,LOVE THIS GPS,"I've used many GPS units in my geocaching adventures, and this is a great model. It's easy to use, it's accurate, and durable. I'm a gadget geek, so I'd like it to have more customizable features. If you're looking for a reliable, easy to use model, this is the one for you."
4,Enjoying GPS unit geocaching,"Just started geocaching and picked up this unit. Coordinates easy to input by hand and easy to ""goto."" But deleting waypoints took me a while to figure out. I had some problems getting service on overcast days that I didn't expect. I haven't tried to up/download any coordinates yet, but it sounds confusing. I like the basics on the unit, and especially the joystick control. I don't like documentation and lack of intuitiveness of the more complicated actions, like routes and downloading. Also got a carry case and glad that I did!"
4,Garmen Legend does the job.,Is a very good product. It makes geocaching a lot of fun. Would recommend the Garmin Legend to anyone who does not want to spend a lot of money but does want a gps device that works well for geocaching.
4,lots of gadget for the money,"This little gadget does pretty much what the description said it would do. I bought it as a toy, so it suits my purposes fine. The only thing I miss in this budget model is better base maps. In Austin, it shows big streets like Oltorf and Lamar, but not the residential streets (just like the box said it would do)."
4,Rebates,I have perchased this item. When I did so there was a fifty dollar rebate advertised. How do I take advantage of this?Please double check my order and see if there has been some kind of error.Thank you:Tony rodeghiero
5,"Easy to use, versatile","I had the eTrex standard (the yellow one) until it was stolen about a month ago. Decided to try the Legend because of the memory size as I do lot of work on boats. I like the features of this unit. Data entry is easier using the Click Stick, which is real selling point for me as I am constantly updating my waypoints and tracks and such. The only minor complaint I have is that I wish they would make the screen a little larger. I know this is a hand held unit, but a little larger screen would be great. I use the larger text option to overcome this option as I often can't have the unit in my hand when I need it and being able to glance over and get the critical navigating info at a glance is important to me. Overall a great unit at a good price."
4,Asia/Pacific Basemap,"We, too, had a bit of confusion about the basemap. The unit will auto-acquire your location after a few minutes of sky-searching. I think the Asian basemap is a result of a factory test that is done in the factory in Taiwan. The unit will start up with its last known location.Kudos to Garmin for testing the product. Take off a few marks for not including a brief section on this in the user's manual. Otherwise, it is a good lightweight and compact tool."
2,Not for walking in a forest,I have mixed feelings about this unit. The software is friendly and it's not too expensive (I had a $50 rebate coupon). Unfortunately it really struggles to pick up a signal when there are trees overhead. This is particularly true if you hang the unit from your neck. Putting it under a shirt so it doesn't bounce around helps some (as does holding it flat in your palm). The Garmin folks tell me the same receiving antenna is in all eTrex models. I'm not ready to scrap it but I have been tempted from time to time.
3,not bad for the price,"I have owned this unit for a couple of years now and have been pretty happy with it. The joystick makes screen navigation a breeze. I glanced over the manual, but really did not need to - the unit is very easy to use. Accuracy varies from 15 to 30 feet in most instances. I have had it reach 8 ft. accuracy a few times. Battery life is ok, but not great. Screen is beginning to lose a pixel here and there, but not enough to hinder usage."
4,Great for the Price,The unit works fine but I feel the letters are too small in a small screen. I also feel browsing thru waypoints is a bit cumbersome. I hope the joysticks does not break in time. Otherwise great for the price .
4,Great value for my money !,"The eTrex Legend took me through the Wadi Rum the first time I used it, having programmed the waypoints from a satellite picture. The road was exactly where it was supposed to be and the eTrex's toggle lever makes it easy to use with one hand on the steering wheel. It has all you need and even more for the price of a night in a New York hotel. If you travel, get Garmin's World Map, too !"
2,Garmin eTrex Legend,When setting up the Legend I dropped on the kitchen linoleum floor. Instant crack and big dark spot on the screen. Can only see the bottom half. Have sent 2 messages to the company requesting service with no response as yet. Not sturdy at all. Probably worth the money for a better system with some sort of guarantee of sturdiness. Worst part is I bought this for my husband for Christmas and was setting it up for him. He at least opened before I broke it...
2,Poor reception; okay interface,"I am not a GPS guru or a geocaching fan. I bought the Garmin eTrex to help me to roughly map out real estate coordinates.I know other folks really love the eTrex, but I did not. The reception was much poorer than I was expecting for a middle-of-the-road unit. In the car, forget about it---terrible reception.I returned my eTrex within a day after purchasing it. Instead, I think that I'll be purchasing a higher end unit from Magellan.As a newb, I found the user interface okay, but not great. The control stick is a nice touch."
5,Simple but very functional,"This simple Garmin GPS is just right as a starter GPS for campouts, hiking, or geocaching. Very simple on the surface, but it has plenty of features, include road maps, that make it useful every day."
4,Garmin etrex Legend,I purchased etrex to measure acreage of farm plots and transfer these plot tracks to map. I am pleased.
3,A little disappointing ...,"I bought a Garmin Etex Legend model a few months ago to go geocaching. It is my first GPS unit. I think it is a great unit, and it only took an hour or so to learn how to use it in conjunction with the owner's manual.The big drawback is, as others have stated, is that it loses its satellite signal way too often. I live in the pine forests of northwest New Mexico. The trees are big and spaced out with grass growing in between. Yet it was irritating how many times it lost its signal. You definitely have to be in an open area with a clear view of the sky.I would not recommend this model to anyone who hikes in heavy forested areas, like the Pacific Northwest."
2,Useless if you live near trees,"The interface is nice, and the built-in maps are better than I expected (in and around Seattle, WA). However, the Legend isn't very good at telling you where you are. Getting a reading consists of a) finding a clearing, b) holding the receiver at arm's length away from your body, c) holding it parallel to the ground, and d) praying that it finds satellites. The Magellan SporTrak that got after my first miserable Legend experience had no problems holding satellite lock on the same trails, regardless of tree cover. The next day, I got my money back on the Garmin."
2,hidden problems,"i was given this as a present to use in my car while traveling. this is definitely NOT what it was designed for since it requires close attention to a very small screen. there are also additional costs associated with owning this unit. first, you must purchase maps to upload into the unit and they can be expensive. second, you may have to purchase a cable to connect the unit to the computer (they do not supply a USB connection so i had to purchase an adapter). the cost of the adapter from garmin is 2 to 3 times the cost of other manufacturers. in the end, this ""present"" cost me well over $120 and isn't really satisfactory for car use unless you have someone with you to operate the unit."
2,Reliability Problems with the e-Trek Legend,"Bought my e-Trek Legend in March 2002 for geocaching; initially it did ok, tracked well but lost signal often when under leafcover in the woods. Started noticing power shutoff problems when first turning it on; thought it was the battery connection, I'm beginning now to think it was poor/thin soldering in the manufacture. Now the click stick will only work in two of four directions. For what I paid for it, and as little as I used it, I doubt if I'll replace it with another Garmin e-Trek, they just don't seem substantial enough for hiking (to think, I cradled that thing like a baby in the woods, being careful with it!)."
5,smooth,Thats all I can say.these three masters are just that smooth.sumptin is one bad ass jam .cause jelly don't shake like dat!
4,Virtuoso Display,"I heard a very exciting jazz trumpet solo on the car radio while driving home from the supermarket. I later found it was Gillespie playing ""Wheatleigh Hall"" from the album ""Duet."" I generally don't like bop and I've never been a Gillespie fan but this performance is superb, very fast played in the upper register without loss of control.I was surprised to learn that the other tracks from the album are not bop. ""Sumphin'"" is bluesy with a very nice piano solo by Bryant.Two of the remaining tracks are more or less Latin, all right I suppose but not to my taste."
4,Dizzy is spectacular!,"With mindblowing solos and really upbeat tracks, this album with keep listening!"
5,Remember what is most important,"Integrity and relationships. So often we forget that it is not our careers that deine us but our integrity and the kinds of relationships we make. This is one of the great movies of the post-WWII period to put the focus on where it belongs - our spouse and our families. Some like ""A Wonderful Life,"" I like ""Man in the Gray Flannel Suit"" as a reminder of what is most important in life and what is worth fighting to preserve. It may seem slow at first but it is drama at its best, drama with a message for us today despite the dated setting."
5,"The Original ""Mad Men""","A really good dramatic film with a myriad of subplots including the world of Madison Avenue advertising, business ethics, wartime bravery, marriage, morality and the rest. Superior acting and a gripping plot make for exceptional entertainment. Lingers with you long after it's over."
3,OK period piece,"It is kind of an odd movie to have been made in the mid fifties. It's themes seem more like a movie made in the seventies: the horror of war, PTSD, impacts of infidelity, conflicts of career advancement vs. family obligations. The story is ahead of it's time and is enjoyable.Though the production values are attractive, the script is meandering and some of the performances are melodramatic.Overall a OK period piece."
3,"Long, Slow & Mediocre","While script did have some interesting elements, overall the film is quite mediocre.1) Film is way too long. Desperately in need of more editing.2) Direction is very heavy handed & overly melodramtic with the pacing way too slow.3) Gregory Peck is at his most stiff & wooden. Needed a director's touch to lighten him up a touch.4) The soundtrack is unendurable.5) The battle scenes were way overdone.I did appreciate the appeal to honesty & human values in the script. It's too bad the film wasn't done much more elegantly. A somewhat watchable but very forgettable film."
3,Dated classic from the Fifties,"While this may have been a classic film from the 50s, it now appears rather dated in the acting and direction compared to the films of 2007. The film plods along slowly, and Gregory Peck does little to improve things with his standard stiff, wooden acting. The story may have been good on paper (and I'm sure the source material was excellent) but the film comes across very awkward, stiff, and melodramatic."
3,Slow going,"Gregory Peck is a middle-class white-collar worker in NYC trying to support a family and get ahead. The movie revolves around three dilemmas facing Peck: 1) how to be honest with his boss while still toeing the line; 2) how to get clear title on a house left to him that someone else is trying to swindle from him; and 3) how to do the right thing when he learns he has a son in Rome by a woman he met during the war. None of these dilemmas is treated very carefully or seriously - in fact, all three are settled to the good with a minimal amount of effort or time expended: a neat little package. There is a lot of pondering over dilemma #1, which takes up much of the long (150+ minutes) movie's time, way too much of it. There are a lot of flashbacks of Peck in the war as well that don't add very much to the overall effect of the film. Just a very flat production. Where's Moby Dick when you need him!"
3,Flawed but worth watching,"This movie has many excellent moments. However, they don't have enough cohesiveness to make an exceptional film. In a sense it is a 1950s version of ""Castaway"" in that you are presented with a character finding high drama in two vastly different worlds. In the hands of a better director it might have gelled. Probably the greatest mystery is why Peck's character loved and stayed with his materialistic and slightly unbalanced wife. Still, the effort is worth watching for fans of Gregory Peck, soap operas, or shrewish spouses."
2,"bad acting, no story flow",acting is pretty bad.story doesn't flow at all.Especially if you've read the book I don't think you'll like the movie.
4,Good story,Another good story from Peck. He brings the character alive. Lots of 'drama' from Jennifer Jones as usual (but I like it!!). Good story line - showing people working through their sins and mistakes and coming out better people. Good movie.
1,save your money,"Perhaps this earned a good grade as a graduate thesis, but as teacher who has worked in several different types of schools, I found the directions and advice from Maria Vlahos and Heidi Hughes so tied to their own unique employment situations that much of the content would either be bad advice or simply not be applicable to the majority of novice teachers across the country. Sorry Maria and Heidi; all schools are NOT the same, all teachers are not the same, and your cookie-cutter solutions won't work most of the time or in most places. Teach a little longer; teach in the public school system, teach in a rural setting, then give blanket advice to beginners."
4,Off the beaten path...,"I found this book to be not only an entertaining read, but a helpful resource as well. The authors' use of humor while sharing their experiences really creates a down-to-earth, user friendly book. Their advice is real. They call it like it is. The book is organized sequentially by events that occur during the school year so it is easy to reference as needs arise. However, unlike other new teacher books, this one is actually a fun read -- I didn't think I'd ever say that about a text/teacher book! It's a paperback book, not too fancy, and I had to wait a bit to get it, but it was worth it. I highly recommend it."
3,Good if you remember how you did the last wedding,"This book has some good tidbits in it, especially for how to include children in your upcoming nuptials. However, I was disappointed to find that it sometimes glossed over important details, such as suggestions for wording invitations to a second wedding, and a list of suggested floral pieces, saying ""You already know this"". For some of us, it has been quite some time since the frantic flurry of first-time wedding planning, so we do NOT remember this. Also lists a lot of quotes and commercial sources from businesses, which seemed a bit odd. This book has some interesting ideas, but you'll almost certainly need another book on wedding planning to supplement the information not included."
1,1001 ways?,"1001 ways? I think if someone took the time to count, this book comes up short. I didn't find anything worthwhile.Having planned my own first wedding, (even though it was all those years ago) I thought most of the tips were pure common sense. I have helped friends with weddings and spent some time ""surfing"" for information on the Internet.This book may be better for someone with more limited experience."
5,So helpful!,"Finally! A book on second weddings that doesn't sound like every other wedding planning book for first-timers! I loved that it gives solid planning advice AND also talks about how to deal with your family, how to include your kids in the wedding, and deal with any nervousness you have about getting married a second time. Great ideas on how to make your wedding different from the first, and dispels old etiquette rules about what you can and can't do at a second wedding. I feel a lot better about my wedding plans since I read this, and I'm definitely going to use more of these ideas."
3,Written for the upscale bride,"Though this book is well written, it is clearly intended for the upscale, big city, second time bride. (How many brides can afford to give their attendants maid service for a year or Broadway play tickets as a thank-you gift?) Those of us who are planning on a limited budget and who live in mid-sized cities will not find the information presented as useful as those with unlimited budgets and unlimited access to vendors."
4,How do you feel?,Do you think those who burned the cd's and carried the signs have yet seen the error of their ways? Are they too now ashamed? Have they realized they have been duped?
5,Wonderful Documentary,"We all know the story of what Natalie said, how they were boycotted from radio, and how they came back to clean up at the 2007 Grammy's. Having known the story, I didn't think I'd get much out of this film. Boy, was I wrong. On a whim, Natalie blurted out what a lot of us were thinking, and it is interesting to see the ramifications of that from the eyes of the Chicks and their manager. This movie had me laughing, rolling my eyes, and in awe at different moments. It was wonderful getting a glimpse into their home life, and seeing how they dealt when they really were scared that their livlihood (and their lives) could be threatened over something so benign."
4,Top 40 Country Shows Its True Colors?,"This DVD was pretty much what I expected. I was never a Chicks fan, but I did recognize their talent, and liked a few of their songs. Whether or not what Maines said about about W was right, what the band got from their so called fans,the right wing, and Top 40 Country radio, was atrocious.I am a performer of country music,and I have not listened to Top 40 Country Radio in years. Now I know why.I'll just bet that over half of the top country performers felt the same way as Natalie. We are living in a country of idiots. Like I said, the film was pretty predictable to me, but then 3 years later, at the same venue as the Bush remark,she(Maines) says it again! That made me weep. Talk about guts."
5,A great Doc,"If you ever wonder what the Dixie Chicks are all about these is a must have DVD you will see them as performers and Mothers,Not as a Stars and not perfect But caring,understanding and funny humans beings.I became a even biger fan of the Dixie Chicks after watching the DVD."
5,Very entertaining for a documentary,"My family and I really enjoyed this movie. We had originally rented it from Netflix and liked it so much that we decided to buy from Amazon. I had a hard time finding it locally, so it was nice to be able to get it for a good price here. I ordered a couple of other items with it, and my order came in about 4 days (with free shipping). I wasn't a big Dixie Chicks fan before seeing the movie, but I am now. Watch it - you won't regret it."
4,Scary,"Extremist views should scare everyone. What happened to the Dixie Chicks should also scare people. To view the amount of hate directed at them for what was said, even if it is their view only, reveals the lack of intelligent thought of many people but also indicates the level of media intrusion and control. I am not sure I would have had their courage, but I am glad they stood and have remained standing."
5,Best Movieof the Year!,"This documentary gives a true picture of the ""incident"" and the ridiculous termoil that followed. It really makes one wonder how people in our society can act so hateful because they disagree with the current administration. The documentary shows how much the chicks love each other, it is an unbreakable friendship. If you want to be informed of the dark, nasty side of American society and what this adminstration (along with far right extremists: i.e. fox news,[...]) has encouraged and upheld....watch this movie!!!"
5,"You Go, Girls!","Saw this picture the same evening as THE U.S. VS. JOHN LENNON, and together that experience produced a feeling of deja ju all over again. It's a disgrace that so often the people running this country (or running their mouths about how it's being run) can't get the idea of free speech through their heads -- you'd think some of the uberpatriots on display here might pause long enough to actually absorb the principles on which America was founded. Koppel and Peck's documentary provides a fascinating chronicle of the Dixie Chicks/Bush flap, worthwhile to the ladies' fans and those of us unfamiliar with their music alike. They were only names in news stories to me before seeing this picture; I'm heading right out and picking up their CDs now -- the music is terrific! This picture, though often infuriating, is ultimately heartwarming in the best way, with a moral victory that's won by the courage of this band's convictions. A marvelous movie."
5,Cds trashed & trampled....,"I have to say this... Did anyone else happen to notice that in the documentary, almost all of the cds that were being smashed, etc. were burned copies?? I laughed so hard over this that it was hard to be disgusted with the whole mess! Why on earth would The Dixie Chicks give a darn if someone chose to smash up their pirated cds??? They received no money for those rip-offs in the first place! As a very loyal fan who BUYS the cds as soon as they come out, that really just struck me as a hoot!"
4,Amazing...,Natalie's voice made me like country music. :) The things she and her band said is what Freedom of Speech is all about. I had to watch this movie for my class. Glad it was an assignment.
3,"Good movie, but it's pan and scan!","I actually haven't seen the film yet, though I hear it's quite good. This is a warning to those of you who have widescreen TVs (more and more of you), or those who will (that's the rest), that this film has had the sides chopped off ""to fit your screen."" Great. I wish I noticed that before I bought it.Update: I did see the DVD, and enjoyed it enough that I would raise my overall rating to 4 stars despite the pan and scan issue."
1,uk release?,I did'nt realise when i ordered this dvd that it came in regions. As this is region 1 i have been unable to view it. Will it be released as region 2 so fan's can view it over in the uk.
1,Just shut up,"Not worth the hype. Sure, some of the lefties will like it for the ""courageous statement"" these three nitwits made, but ultimately there isn't anything here worth watching even though the Dixie Twits can warble a tune. Nothing unique though. Move along."
1,Where's Spinal Tap when you need them?,"A loudmouth in a country band decides to get some cheap applause by trashing an American president on foreign soil. Then the band apologizes. Then they retract the apology and go one step further by trashing their own base of fans, opting instead for the adulation of a liberally-bent media who never liked them in the first place. Then every liberal proudly announces they'll buy their music now in vapid reviews on amazon.com.And the whole world feels warm fuzzies.Is this a new female version of ""This is Spinal Tap""?"
5,"The Chicks Rule, W. Drools.","What a wonderful documentary to teach what freedom of speech is all about. (A teacher)Unfortunately, I would not be allowed to show it to Elementary School students. This is the kind of movie that would only make it to a college.However, all of our children should learn about freedom of speech and standing out for their ideas and ideals.These wonderful women have gone through ""it"" and they gave birth, and sang, and did a lot more for the Universe, than many people do.I am an adopted Texan, and I too, agree with their ideas.Thank you Dixie Chicks for this lesson. See this movie."
5,Freedom of speech,"It has been consistently amazing to me that the Dixie Chicks were lamasted, etc for the very thing for which we ""fight wars"" for, freedom, namely, freedom of speech. I believe that the very people who have been the most critical would explode with fury if their freedom of speech were limited. Natalie was exercising that freedom, perhaps you didn't agree with her opinion, but you should defend to the very end her very right to speak it.anyway the music, the movie and the chicks are GREAT - I took my 13 year old son to see this with me - and even he liked it and agrees with me."
5,awesome!,This documentary was awesome! Let the truth be told! It is an inside look into writing their new album. The Dixie Chicks are an inspiration for women everywhere. I hope freedom of speech never dies! I am so glad the rest of the world has followed suit in their opinion of the war and our president. This movie is worth every cent!
4,"Good, but not great","First I love the Dixie Chicks, as people and as musicans.This is basically a typical, but well done, movie on making of thier new album. Of course the ""twist"" is Natalie's comments and the reactions that it caused and how that all got reflected in the music and lyrics of the album. That ""drama"" of course make this more than just a movie filled with intersting factoid for fans (which I would have watched, it was nice knowing Charlie Robinson loves his wife enough to even go to LA for her). The drama that the Dixie Chicks went though was deep, and reflected the country's debate about the war in Iraq and is a very intersting story no matter where in politics you may lay. But it is intertwinded with factoids that really only fans will care about.So for fans of the music, for those who whish to know about the events that have lead to the Dixie Chicks being banned from country music this is a nice film. But nobody should confused it with a great documentary."
5,Just shut up and sing,My opinion is the only reason people got mad at the Dixie Chicks is they went to another country and disrespected our then president I am all for freedom of speech but don't go to another country and talk bad about the usa or the countries leader do it at home I love this documentary one of my favorites and I am glad we as a nation turned on this person (Natalie) because it just wasn't right to say what she said other then the US if she would have just said that here nothing would have ever came of it no backlash and the chicks would probably be as popular as ever a tough but good lesson learned.
5,Now I understand...,"This is actually quite a good thought provoking DVD. I don't particularly care for actors or performers who use their popularity and public forum to espouse their private views, but this video sums it up quite well. The Dixie Chicks are a business venture and if one of them, unknowingly in this case, does something to hurt the business they shouldn't be surprised if the business suffers. As performers the group is very talented - as politicians they are lightweights who should ""Shut Up & Sing"". Bush will be gone next year (2008); maybe the public will forgive, forget, and business will improve."
3,shut up and sing,I loved the film however my experience would have been more enjoyable if I had not made my purchase from Amazon.com. I ordered the movie over a year ago and Amazon.com kept sending me emails delaying the delivery date giving me an option to either cancel my order or keep waiting until it became available. I opted to wait because I really wanted to see the documentary. I probably selected to wait at least 4 times over the course of 14 months before they finally sent me an email telling me that Amazon.com regretted that they were unable to fill my order and that they cancelled my order. So with my order cancelled because Amazon.com said they did not have the DVD I went to Amazon.com pulled up the video purchased what they told me they did not have and finally over a year later I was finally able to see the film.
3,Free Speech?,"Being from Canada, I didn't hear too much about the controversy that surrounded the Dixie Chicks. Even when the song 'Not Ready To Make Nice' came out, I didn't even realize it had anything to do with President Bush until I looked it up on the Internet. I can't believe the crap that these three ladies had to put up with due to the comment that Natalie Maines made. I understand the reason behind the fact why they made this movie, I just didn't really like it. I seemed like an extended music video...which had already been made. I like the Dixie Chicks, their music, and especially their opinion of a certain US president but I just didn't like their film. The Dixie Chicks were ahead of some of their audience in recognizing the disastrous nature of the war but many in that audience have now caught up with those sentiments and the Dixie Chicks have broadened their audience and their music since then."
4,Take a lesson,"This documentary gave me a new found respect for the Dixie Chicks. As a person who has always loathed country music, despite my Southern upbringing, I now have respect for the true talent these ladies display. The film gives you good insight into the controversial comments about President Bush, the anger of the American public, and the power of censorship. I think it's a good film to use with excerpts in a high school discussion of censorship or obtain a ""clean"" version to delete the profanity. I like the film overall and I think it would spark an interesting discussion about the freedom of speech."
2,You'd be mad to buy this instead of some of his others,"This is my fourth Hammond novel and I didn't find it to be of the same high quality as the other three I have read. This story is about a kennel owner, John Cunningham whose car is stolen from out front of his business with a quarantined dog named Jove in the back. Jove's owner Noel Cochrane was moving to America and his briefcase containing important papers was also in the vehicle along with John's shotgun. The cops aren't too happy with John, Noel disappears and bodies keep appearing while searching for the car and possible rabies filled Jove.Sounds exciting you say. Well yeah it is in parts but there are a lot of boring needlessly lengthy chapters in between the good stuff. I have also read the Dirty Dollar, The Snatch and A Running Jump which are sensational five star rated thrillers by Hammond. This book however is not in the same league as them."
4,My kid loves it!,"Easy to assemble, sturdy quality, excellent price. Can't say anything negative about this product. A great buy for our son."
3,18 inch boys bike,"my son likes the bike colors (its like on fire!)we didn't like the coaster brake, it made difficult for my son to change the pedal position when getting into the bike. Also the fork was probably bended during shipping, because we couldn't fit the wheel on it, and we had to take it to a bike shop, where they just opened it by force and fitted the wheel in.In the end is a good bike, sturdy enough for a kid."
5,an excellent recording,"I saw Paquito D'Rivera's quintet in concert at Madison, Wisconsin last night, November 17, 2007. I completely enjoyed the performance and I recollect that all the selections played except one (To Brenda my love from Tico Tico) came from this recording. All the players in the quintet were virtuosos. But the performance succeeded because of the good balance of structure and improvisation. The ensemble playing was well-executed. Nice melodies.This recording, which I had not heard until the drive home after the show, is even better than the live performance as it greatly benefits from the contributions of some invited players, specifically the conguero and the bandoneon.After the concert, more than 100 people lined up for Paquito's autograph on their disc. I thought it was a fine show and that sentiment appeared to be universal. I look forward to seeing this group again."
5,Great CD,Paquito is a monster player. His clarinet playing is amazing. A true legend who does well in the classical and jazz genres. Great Band!! Definitely recommend it. Fast shipment and product as described. Thanks!!
4,Good budget pleaser,"Happy with the purchase. The only isue I have is that it would have been nice to have an area cut out in the padding to put 2 boxes of ammo. If you want this just to transport 2 guns, then it works really well. Not a vault or overly secure pistol case, but you can put locks on it. Great an inexpensive way to get your guns from home to where you are going."
4,decent for transport to/from range,"Good price +1- until I found the plano four gun case for even cheaper. -1Big enough to hold 2 full sized pistols and 1 subcompact, plus 2 extra magazines. +1Plastic is flexible enough that with a padlock on the case, I was able to pry it apart enough to take the full size pistol out - and the pistol also had a trigger lock on it. -1But it was always intended only to transport to/from range so I'm good with it. +1"
4,Not Too Bad,"i got this case to store and carry my tattoo machines in. it's lightweight and compact, with nice foam lining.the only thing i didn't pay attention to and should have is that it only snaps closed and if i wanted to lock it, i'd have to buy a lock to hang on the side of it through a loop that's already there. it can also probably be easily broken. however, for storing and carrying not so expensive tools it's a great case. i don't own any guns so i wouldn't know if it's good for guns or not."
3,Suitable for Storage,"This case was what I had expected, as I had read previous reviews. Needed a double case as my gun has a scope on it and I like to carry extra clips and ammo in same case. We no longer shoot competition, so the case will carry the gun from house to home range just fine. Plano is a reputable product line. I liked the pillard center, keeps light weight case from collasping, if something gets set on it."
5,Nice 2 gunn case.,Well it is a decent hard plastic case for 2 hand guns. I got this so i could take t hand guns and extra clips to the range. It has enough for a 9mm and a .40 with 3 clips for each and it all is not stuffed. The hand guns are not compact. Hope that gives ppl a good idea of size and what can be fit into it. Shipping was fast and the packing was perfect.
4,Great case,"I had hoped that this case would fit a Gamo PT-85 tactical with tru-glo dot sight, tac light and laser but it was not to be. While the gun does fit lengthwise (grip to barrel) it did not fit with the tac light and laser which are mounted on the sides. It's fine if you do not mind taking off the laser and tac light each time but who wants to do that. Overall I can still use this case to hold two standard pistols no problem."
5,Great CD By A Great Band,This is a fantastic album by a great melodic rock band from the 80's that's very underrated. Franke and the boys made 3 great albums in the early 80's and their well represented on this CD. The band has a great mix of keyboards and guitars with great vocals. KEEP ON FIGHTING and SWEETHEART display Franke's ability to rock hard as well as perform great ballads. The more you listen the better this CD sounds.
5,Incredible!,This CD is wonderful because it is one of the few concerts Ella had recorded in stereo. You also get to hear how she interacts with the live audience -- which is the essence of jazz. Get it!
2,Seeing a little bit of America and too much of the boy,"I evaluated this book to use with audiences outside of the United States. The book didn't communicate the message we wanted. A 16-year old (who looks about 8 in the drawings) driving across the US by himself. Then, towards the end of the book in the state of Nevada, he sheds his clothes and we are presented with a lovely illustration of his backside. It was one of those moments when I thought, ""what was the author thinking"" - this is book for first/second graders.Still looking for a book that shows America in a positive light."
3,Would have been great except...,"Why the nudity? I also thought, ""What was the author and illustrator thinking?!"" This book is not appropriate for teachers of young students. The entire book is great with wonderfully powerful words and descriptions, except for the page on Nevada that describes how the boy took his clothes off and continues to show a picture of his bottom. This came in a writing kit I purchased and I concluded it is not appropriate for my second graders."
2,There are better ways to see America,"1) Drawings seem a little grotesque. The proportion and perspective is often askew, and human figures are distorted. Not terribly pleasant to look at.2) Is this a story about a trip that one of the authors took? It seems like a self-indulgent storyline (""Let me write about a trip a took!"") and when I read it, I'm left wondering why I should be all that interested in this particular seven-state route.3) Taking off all your clothes and running around because you're in Nevada? (Even if the author did this in reality, it doesn't add anything to the story. A good editor should have told them so.)4) Weird geography. Missing from the itinerary are Indiana, Illinois, and Utah (or Idaho). Was the story too long with these included, or was their nothing witty to say about them?"
2,Exhibitionist Hippy Loves America,"This is a book about an exhibitionist hippy, who despite her hippy ways, does love America. The exhibitionist hippy, like so many tree-hugging hippies, ends up in Oregon. Good for her."
4,Captures Women's Friendships,"Talk Before Sleep captures the essence and depth of women's friendships like few books I've ever read. The cast of extremely diverse women make a beautiful ensemble to help their dying friend. If you love true stories of deep friendship, I highly recommend this book."
5,An Audio Review,"Being such a fan of Elizabeth Berg's, I have hesitated until now to write a review of any of her works, worrying that I won't do her justice. But I just recently purchased the audio version of ""Talk Before Sleep"" and enjoyed it immensley. Unfortunately I could only get my hands on the abridgement, but it was definitely worth the purchase! Beth Fowler does a wonderful job. She captures the feeling perfectly. The women's voices sound true as when you read the story. Fowler slightly alters her tone or pitch with the different characters, but the effort isn't overdone and therefor not distracting or false-sounding. The abridgement is well done too. None of the gems have been taken out of the story. I've listened to the production about 5 times now, mostly while in the bath. (I've got great hot water here, it's hard to get out of the tub!) Do yourself a favor and track down these tapes!"
4,Talk before Sleep,This author tells a good story. Her characters are well developed and the twists and turns in the story keep a reader interested to the end.
2,She has done better,"Even so I read the book in two days and was touched by it, I have to say that Elizabetz Berg has done better. Unlike in 'Range of motion' or her 'Katie-books' for example, the dramatic moments in this one often feel forced and tasteless. The character of the nurse remains flat and lifeless, the other characters often seem very exaggerated. It almost feels as if Berg tried to fill the story with life by adding different stereotypes, like Sarah, the efficient, pretty, petit businesswoman and L.D., the baseball cap wearing, bulky lesbian with a crew cut.So all in all it was a disappointing book, especially since one is spoiled by Berg's previous excellent work."
4,Truly Amazing,I couldn't put this book down. It is a beautifully written story - I highly recommend it to anyone who has lost someone close to cancer.
3,Okay.....,"I was expecting blockbuster prose based upon the customer reviews I read. I was not bowled over by this book, and I wonder if perhaps I just expected too much. I did appreciate the focus on the emotions and thoughts, as opposed to attempting to paint a picture of the surroundings. The end tries too hard to jerk tears, however, and I felt that it was a bit of overkill."
2,"Though well-written, this book was very disappointing.","I did not cry-- I felt depressed after reading this book. The women, especially Ruth, seemed to all have self-indulgent lives. Their lives could have been ennobled through the heart-wrenching struggle of letting someone go who is fighting cancer. Yet they bicker, they debase one another while idealizing a life (Ruth's) which has been wasted in her own self pursuits. The dialogue is offensive though it might seem realistic to many women. I read this book as a favor to a dear friend, but I do not recommend it."
5,The laughter and intimacy of women&#65533;s friendship,"The fact that one of the two main characters is dying of breast cancer doesn't set the tone of this book by prolific Elizabeth Berg; it just puts the friendship between these women in sharp focus and makes us prize them even more. Although in the hands of another author, the dissimilar characters of Talk Before Sleep might become stereotypical caricatures, Berg does not succumb to this pitfall. All the characters have realistically sympathetic as well as irritating qualities.Although lovers, husbands, and children are important elements that receive their fair share of page time, it is the supreme depth of friendship between women that is honored in this lovely book. It's a quality that men rarely experience, share, or even understand. Read this book - and then make a donation to breast cancer research."
5,Heartbreakingly beautiful,"A wonderful book about friendship, love, and death. The tears just rolled as i read it. There are passages you just have to highlight as you read them because they are so beautiful and profound. A definite favorite of mine forever!"
1,"If you like sappy unrealistic books, you'll love it; I don't","My bookclub read this book and of the 10 women, only one enjoyed it. This truly is a sappy unrealistic book. What women would desert her child and husband for a dying, unlikeable, self-centered ""friend""? Most of the men were written to be the enemy, and the women were stereotypical emotion binging, male bashing whiners.It is amazing to me to see that most of the people gave this book 5 stars when this book really is not literature...it could never be a classic. It is a memorable book in only one respect--it is on my list of the worst 5 books that I've ever read."
2,The book didn't ring realistic to me.,"This throwback to my college womens studies classes was trite and corny. OK, maybe well written and imaginative in parts, but resorts to the same old male bashing,lesbian elevating stuff I've read before.The men were too evil or thinly written in charicatures, and the women were stereotypical food binging, emotion binging, weak downtrodden whiners. Sorry, didn't like it."
2,"Realistic Portrayal, come on!","Talk Before Sleep appeared to be a touching story about women and the sanctity of the frindships;however after chapter one I realized that was only the cover story. Who actually behaves like this? We don't all fantasize about leaving our husbands, passionatley kiss our so-called ""best friend,"" and use profanity freely. By all means I am no prude, but I don't know any friends, neighbors, or colleagues who would act like Ruth, Ann, or L.D. Thank goodness my pals are a bit more mature and settled. And couldn't the lesbian have enjoyed the music of someone other than K.D. Lang? Predictable, trite, and an ill attempt at a tribute to all who have past away from breast cancer. The premise was intriguing, the execution of the storyline lacking. Why did I insist on finishing this sleeper?"
1,"Poorly researched, poorly thought out","Talk Before Sleep reviewAuthor Elizabeth Berg may have been a nurse, but she sure doesn't know much about nutrition. In ""Talk Before Sleep"", the friends of the dying woman seem determined to promote Anne's cancer as much as possible, in the food they bring her, and to get started on their own versions of the disease as soon as they can. They start off by meeting over cheeseburgers; move on to martinis, pizza, lobster, and repeated orders of French fries. Then they consume fudge, garlic bread, beer, potato chips and ice cream. Vegetables and fruits that could protect against cancer are scrupulously avoided. For some reason, the narrator lapses into nutritional awareness when she is concerned about yellow dye in the macaroni she's preparing for her daughter. However, for the older women, the theme must be ""let's get it over with and resume our friendship in heaven.""Vesanto Melina, Registered Dietitian, http://www.nutrispeak.com"
5,superb read,"I agree with other reviews that this reads as reality, not fiction. The saddest part thing about this book is that it ended. The friendship of the women in this story is envious and admirable.Gutsy story that teaches how to live honestly, how to be a friend and how to die with dignity. You MUST read this"
3,Steve Stevens - Atomic Playboys,"Album review: ATOMIC PLAYBOYS: Steve Stevens (WEA)WITH Guns N' Roses opening a whole new hapter in music industry clonedom, the HR/HM catalogue has been cluttered with sleazy riffs, leather and denim of late. What the release of this album and the Mr Big opus does is squeeze rock `n' roll back into the spandex and opens up the sunroof.Full review here:[...]"
2,GREAT GUITAR WORK..!!,"FAN OF BILLY IDOL???WELL THIS ALBUM IS A BIT MORE THAN BILLY IDOL WOULD EVER WANT TO PROGRESS TO...STEVE STEVENS IS A VERY UNDERATED GUITARIST..... A GOOD ALBUM FOR GUITAR FANS...MANY STYLES ARE SHOWN ON HERE.....SOME VERY FLASHY SOLOS AS YOU WOULD EXPECT...PRODUCTION IS TYPICAL FOR THIS ERA...THE SONGWRITING IS OK.....BUT IF YOU'RE A FAN OF STEVESTEVENS THIS IS A MUST HAVE....BEST SONG-... ""ACTION""- THE BEST VERSION I HAVE HEARD SO FAR...."
2,Beau Hill sucked the life out of Steve Stevens,"Revisiting this album after listening to ""Black Light Syndrome"", ""Situation Dangerous"", and the single he did with Billy Idol for the movie ""Speed"", this album is almost a Flintstonian execution of a metal spoof album. With lyrics like ""an SDI like a gun at his hip when he meets you"" on the title track, you are not sure if this album is aiming towards a joke in Spinal Tap/Bad News territory or if the album is just going into the really awful album realm from where no comedy can be derived. The playing is top notch, the song writing varies from one or 2 good songs, to the bad, to the absolutely insipid. Beau Hill also produced Winger; it sounds like either he encouraged Steve and boys to go over the top in terms of camping it up or instead lead them off the cliff."
2,"Hair today, goon tomorrow.","I bought this for a friend who LOVES Hair Band Butt Rock. I have always dug the Steve Stevens ""squeal feel"" style, and I feel were it not for him Billy Idol would never have been a star. My friend loved this as an addition to his collection and I never have to hear it again, so we're both happy."
1,BAD SELLER!!!!! DONT GO HERE!!!,"I ordered a fan back in October(06). 30 days on backorder, Got shipment damaged! Reordered,another 30 days backorder, Now they are holding up order and want me to ship damaged item on my dime, After 3 customer reps. promised no problems. Asked for MANAGER (rick) who is holding up process to explain and he will not return paying customers phone calls. Even the nice customer reps. are embarrassed when they have to call me back to explain Managers reasonings.DONT BE FOOLED BY THIS COMPANY!! JIM HUNT."
4,Turned this one into a WINDOW FAN...NICE!,"Actually I got on here to find out: WHAT IS THE CFM of this fan? Turns out I don't think Honeywell rates in cfm. ANYWAY: I constructed an ""AIRTIGHT! (no gaps) piece of plywood with a hole in it. (suggestions: Take the grill off / mark or trace the hole to be accurate --- Secure the fan to the plyuwood around the grill (simple screws and washers work fine) and move the controls somewhere to the side) THERE IS LIKE A BREEZE THROUGH EVERY WINDOW (strategically opened) OF OUR 2 STORY 2000 Sq.' HOUSE!!!!!!!! ps: Screw pre-bought window fans now!"
4,Don't touch me there,"How can I begin to say how much I have enjoyed this cd. Her voice is smooth, strong, and chilling. I would just like to know why record companys haven't been fighting to get her to record more. I truly beleive that she could be as good as Celine, if only given a chance to get her hands on some of the songs given to Celine."
5,"intelligent, interesting mystery","Elizabeth Gunn knows how to tell a story and she creates believable, interesting characters. Her books are truly page turners. I highly recommend Par Four and the first book in the series as well, Triple Play. I am looking forward to the next in the series."
2,Evolution to Crap,"Skinless was BRUTAL! I am from Saratoga, the area where Skinless spawned and i see them an average of seven times a year. This album just plain sucked, it's ""cool albany"" music that forces itself to be technical, it's overdone. What's with the clean vocals and the awful instrumental ""A False sense of Security"" it sounds like a nintendo game. Give metal a break and go back to your roots. Listen to Dying Fetus. Skip this oneBOOORRRIINNNGGGG"
1,skinless man................. a joke!!!,Man........man this cd is a joke skinless doing clean vocals that is very funny and i never seen skinless like this before and also i thought this cd was going to kick [butt] with john longstreth from origin drumming for this album but never mind and i am very upset that john left origin for skinless that man he is one amazing drummer got to tell yeah supported him since angel corpse now man can't say nothing well getting into the cd this cd has weird riffs and other than that this cd sucks!!! don't buy it beware!!!
1,Crapola,"This is bad death metal. Not even the funny, jokey kind that I enjoy from Hate Eternal, Exhumed, etc.Death, demons, gates of Hell, blast beats up the wazoo and yet another singer who sounds like he's smoked four packs a day since birth...yada yada yada.Utter crap."
1,Cheesy and poser garbage.,"What the f*ck is this ? Skinless ""sacrifice to survival"", is another weak album & band out of the relapse records crow... I mean, relapse has some decent bands ""necrophagist"" , ""incantation"" , ""cephalic carnage"" , ""today is the day"", and a few others but boy do they got some of the crappiest and most chessiest bullsh*t bands i've ever seen, like, ""pigdestroyer"" , ""nasum "" , ""skinless , ""mortician"" , ""suffocation"" , ""regurgitate"" etc...Skinless, has no talent and their vocalist? Sucks. Once i seen the picture of skinless--Idiots. Football players wanna be deathmetal fa**ots. Don't waste you money."
5,Deserves 6 stars,"I happened to discover Skinless while aimlessly wandering the internet in search of new heavy music. I was totally blown away by the samples I heard and went to purchase the album immediately. This album is shockingly, assaultingly good! The song writing and production are top-notch. The songs are incredibly heavy and brutal. The heaviness of this album is achieved through creative and dark riffing, stellar drumming, and great vocals. Whereas some death metal bands rely on speed and technicality to achieve their ""dark"" and ""evil"" sounds, Skinless pulls it off by playing at a slightly slower, brooding tempo, occasionally unleashing some hyperblast. Words alone cannot express how fantastic this album is. You need to hear it for yourself and discover some of the best death metal in recent years. Skinless rules!"
5,BRUTAL!!!!,"I have been anticipating this new Skinless album for awhile and when I found out John Longstreth from Origin was playing drums, I got even more psyched. This album completely blew me away after the first listen. It is more technical and melodic then other Skinless releases yet it maintains the brutality and heaviness we expect. John's drumming is far superior to any extreme metal drummer in the scene today, as he adds a new light to the music. There is also a wee bit of singing and clean parts on the album which add to the excitement. Any death metal fan should pick this up. Relapse rips!"
2,"Yes, please do hurry up and die Pinkie!","Just plain dark and rather dumb. Who would ever be attracted to that glowering idiot Pinkie?! He was scary to look at before she even knew he was a killer...after that, is any girl dumb enough to hang around with him?! Ah, don't answer that...yes, plenty probably are. I was glad when it was all over...that about sums it up.Rose was acted wonderfully and Helen Mirren is quite the lady! Other than that...meh."
4,Great Graham Greene!,"Classic Greene British Crime Novel Updated in this adaptation to the Mods & Rocker's riots of the 60's Brighton!Some Changes in the Story, But still an Engaging, Beautifully filmed, & Well Acted Film!4 stars, because I thought the character of ""Fred Hale"" was Miscast. Sean Harris, an Intense actor, was just Too young for that part & to be involved with Helen Mirren's ""Ida"""
4,Brighton Rock,"A bit of a departure from the original. Advertized as a story set set in the 1960-s British Mod scene, the theme might have been explored a bit more. Acting is quite good. Nice camera work. Sadly, something special just isn't there."
3,"Young psycho of Brighton, London","A story of 1964-London where five man gang rocketed Brighton keeping their business apart from local competitive Italian mafia operating in the same area. As godfather was mistakenly murdered, things started changing swiftly for the four gangsters.Not so much watching but a psychotic character of young merciless new gang boss and then life in then UK self-exemplifying the best to the rest of the world as usual."
2,Horrible people and annoying soundtrack,"It's not so much the actors here that bother me; it's the irritating story of a criminal who treats a young woman badly, yet she stays with him and even marries the jerk because he gives her some attention. So stupid. This is not at all romantic. I wished they would just hurry up and die. Also, the soundtrack is overdone and incredibly pervasive and annoying."
2,Wish I had the first 29 volumes,"I bought this book thinking it was the complete work. Only after its arrival did I discover it was volume 30. It is Sayyid Qutb's commentary on the Qur'an after the 70th surah. Most of the surahs I desired to know Qutb's comments on were not included in this late volume. To be fair, according to remarks in the preface, the English version began with volume 30. I have not found an English version of the first 29."
2,Chris Barry needed the money.,"This seemed ok, but then I put it on. Chris Barry did his best, but this is another attempt by the English to make an American movie. Sean Pertwee has been in a lot of bad movies. This is deffinately one of them. If you like a bit of gore, go for it. This was never meant to be taken seriously, and Barry has a few good lines, but it is over the top and a bit forced. The English do comedy very well, but they have a differant style, and budget to the Americans. This is an American movie."
2,Too many details; too time consuming,"This book was rather disappointing, especially considering its rave reviews. It was selected for my book club and I was not surprised to learn that only 3 of the 6 of us finished the slow reading novel. I will NOT recommending this book to anyone, for several reasons. It is muddled in minutiae that is too time consuming to read and causes the reader to lose interest and focus. The book is choppy and does not flow well, partially caused by too many characters that are superfluous. Donna, the main character, is frustrating. Although she has her share of challenges, the reader never learn enough details about her and why she makes the poor choices she makes. As a result, this entire book was frustrating and didn't leave much for our book club to discuss: no one enjoyed it. On a positive note, I did enjoy the authors humor and great insight into the musical and polka world."
3,Decent,"Problems with Mr. DeRogatis' Book---------------------------------1. Far too frequent use of the word ""nadir"".2. Little on Pavement.3. Little on the Pixies (writing a book on alternative without at least an article on the Pixies is unforgivable).That being said, Mr. DeRogatis' certainly has balls and is not afraid to insult some of the most critically acclaimed bands. Overall, a decent write-up of the alternative era before it became a mockery of itself."
1,Critics enjoy listening to themselves whine,"Critics enjoy listening to themselves whine, and this book is the height of their craft. Derogatis should be persona non-gratis. A wanabee rock star who gets his kicks by tearing apart great bands.If the guy would at least label what he likes about a few bands, he could be considered balanced. But he's an ego-maniac looking to pop the ego he sees in Rock stars of the past and present ...The guy has trashed bands/albums as diverse and good as The Beatles ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,"" Radiohead's ""OK Computer"" and Nirvana's ""Nevermind"" and U2's ""Atomic Bomb"""
1,"This Just In: Jim De Still Fat, Still A Poseur","I'll make this quick. I bought the book because it's the first I've seen to focus solely on the ""Alternative"" rock I came of age with in the early 90's. The next day, after reading far more than I should have, I returned it to the local corporate bookstore and reallocated the money to a couple tabloid magazines and a cup of coffee. What Paris Hilton is currently wearing is far more interesting than this book, which boils down to Derogatis trying to overcompensate for his inherent uncoolness. He has made a name for himself in the world of rock criticism by taking critically and commercially successful bands to task while at the same time trumpeting the greatness of some of the worst crap the decade produced while ignoring some of the best that came out of the time period. There's a reason why you can buy this tripe brand new for a mere $2.50 on this site."
5,Love Mac,"Loved this when it was showing on TV, love it still. And, now I've got my kids loving it! I've just introduced them to it and they haven't stopped watching it."
2,"Now, Come on!","Honestly. I am happy to finally own all the episodes of the first season. The show was still finding its legs, and it wasn't until season two that it really found it's stride, but it's still worth it to own them. But for the price listed? If this were a good release, replete with special features, commentary, interviews with Richard Dean Anderson and even Henry Winkler - it might be. I'm a crazy fan, so I bought it, but I am not happening.It's strange logic, no doubt. Paramount will probably pony up the cash for a sweet season two release if season one does well, but it won't do well with this release. Way to shoot yourself in the foot.My advice: Buy it as inexpensively as you can find it, and write an angry letter to Paramount."
5,I would like to know,"Hello, I am from Barranquilla (Colombia) and I am 28 year old, I grew up watching all this series, like Knight Rider, The A-Team, Automan, Airwolf, Mission Impossible, X-Files and I am very interested in buying the DVD's, but Idon't know if Macgyvers DVD has spanish subtitles.I bought Knight Rider season one because it has spanish subtitles, but I don't know if Macgyver has them too.Please could you tell me if this DVD has spanish subtitles.Thank you very much..."
3,Good as Expected,"As a kid from the 80's, i grew up on MacGyver and enjoyed every bit of it. Now i own the entire series collection and i must say Season 4 is every bit as good as i remembered it to be.I must say though i was a bit disappointed with the packaging by amazon. When i opened it, the cases on the inside were broken as well as the disc holders.Beside that minor fact, i STILL recommend the season for any collector or MacGyver fan."
2,It was great to watch it as a child,"But now that I'm all grown up, it's one of the most boring shows one can think of. So maybe a good buy for children, but not for adults."
4,"Good Series, bad packaging","We love MacGyver and were not disappointed with the fourth season. The only problem I have is that the cases were damaged. This had to have happened during the factory packaging, because the little plastic clips that hold the DVD in the case were broken off and missing. The DVD's were rattling around loose in the cases."
5,THE GREATEST ACTION/ADVENTURE PROGRAM OF ALL TIME!!!,"ONE POSITIVE THING TO SAY ABOUT 2005 IS THE RELEASE OF MACGYVERTO DVD. ALTHOUGH NUMEROUS BOOTLEG EDITIONS HAVE BEEN RELEASED, THIS IS THE FIRST OFFICIAL U.S. RELEASE FROM PARAMOUNT!!MACGYVER IS THE MOST ORIGINAL TELEVISION SERIES OF ALL TIME AND THE CHARACTER CANNOT BE COMPARED BY ANY OTHER.IT'S ABOUT TIME A DESERVING TELEVISION SERIES GETS IT TIME TO SHINE!!THANKS PARAMOUNT!!!!!"
3,video is okay; set does have closed captions,"i never saw this show in the eighties, but my brother was a big fan. I started watching the first disc and found it very entertaining, even with the cheesy music, bad acting and worse haircuts. Richard Dean Anderson makes a terifficaly likeable hero and my mom, who also never saw the show in the eighties, instantly fell in love with him. I can see why my buddies back then liked this show so much. like a good mystery show (Murder, She Wrote or Columbo) the fun is in seeing how MacGyver uses everyday objects to create such neat weapons or tools. the video on the first three episodes isn't too bad; i think it's watchable. and while the set doesn't have subtitles, it does have closed captions. very important for my brother who is hearing impaired."
4,Icna2000 please read this!,"To anyone wanting to know (such as Luis Narvaez), there are no spanish subtitles in this DVD set. It really is a no-frills basic set. But it's MACGYVER! Gotta luv it anyway."
2,These DVDs are an injustice to the show!,"I watched MacGyver for years when it was on, and continued to watch the re-runs on various channels as well. Then I got the DVDs for birthdays and holidays. I was psyched (yes, child of the 80's).I got these as a gift, so I'm quite greatful, but so far (Season 1), the quality of the DVD is HORRIBLE.I don't much care for the extra frills (behind the scenes, actor bios, etc.), but Paramound didn't even bother to fix any damage to the master film/tape that they were using. I agree with user D. Mok's review, they did a horrible and lazy job of putting this beloved series to DVD. Makes me think that at times I'm watching a film in class on the vintage high-school reel-to-reel projectors.I bet if I go out and get the original 1979 Battlestar Galactica on DVD it won't be anywhere near this bad in quality.For now, save yourself the money, buy a DVD recorder and record it on SpikeTV... it's probably better quality."
2,we r in 21st century & what we get?,"very disappointed. we are in the 21st century. every major production companies have digitally remastered their old TV series and movies except for one studio: Paramount. seriously: Audio - Mono??? and obviously there was no digital remasterization of the picture. also there is no special feature which there is enough space on the last disc for. the ""closed caption"" logo is there but there is no subtitles at all. what's even worse is that these are dual-layer discs: i've seen movies on a single-layer disc that are better featured (most of the old movies now on DVD from MGM, meaning a whole movie on one side with some special features: MGM put on one side widescreen, the other side fullscreen and all remastered. well some of them). who the hell were the people in charge of this project of putting MacGyver on DVD? sure they did a damn bad job: i'd never hire anyone with ""MacGyver DVD project"" in his resume."
4,Good overall.,"The Macgyver three season pack is overall a good deal. The DVD quality is better than VHS but lacks the many menu options available on other DVD's. Overall though, if you are a fan of Macgyver you will enjoy this item."
5,Richard Dean Anderson makes the show,"He is the most underrated actor out there. In fact, he is as underrated as Kevin Costner and John Malkovich are overrated. He made this show, just like his sense of humor and presence made the SG-1 series.Good wholesome TV at its finest folks."
2,"I am The biggest Mac Fan on the Planet, BUT........","I was very disappointed in the quality of the season 1 DVD box set. There is absolutely no bonus materials, no enhanced/restored video and audio, and the packaging job was cheesy as all hell. This TV program is a cult classic and it should be treated as such. I certainly hope the season 2 set has more features and better picture and sound quality. I think I'm going to write to Paramount Television and tell them what a bang up job they did. And by the way, Bilbo Bayonets is a shmuck."
1,Could have been better,"The series really suffered because of acting and, in later years, writing. The first season is alright, though. MacGuyver doesn't grow a social conscience (e.g., jump the shark)until later in the series."
1,Not good.,The concept of the show was tolerable at best but inately sophomoric. The lead actor is profoundly untalented. Spend your money elsewhere.
5,My man Macgyver,I always watched Macgyver when it was on for the 7 seasons and taped almost every episode. Decided I wanted them on DVD when they came out. Although I only have the 1st season I shall get more in the future.One of my favorite shows on TV. Thank you. Rainey
5,This book is worth the money.,"This book is well worth, your time and a must read for anyone that wants to understand Africa and it's contribution to the world."
1,the suction that failed,This device worked great for about 4 weeks then the suction failed. I cleaned cone and device. Used 3 to 4 times per week for a total use of 12 to 15 times before it stopped working.
1,This product sucks,I bought this product and less than 30 days later it literally just stopped working. I then had to pay for it to go back to Panasonic as it was less than 30 days later. They sent me a replacement product which is basically a really good fan with a little bit of suction. I would send it back again but at this point I am going to spend more returning it then I would have on the product. When I first got it seemed to work really good especially for the clogged pores around my nose. But again if you want to buy a product with a short lifespan this is the one you should get otherwise don't purchase it.
2,Very disappointed :-(,"Before I bought mine I read the reviews and reading the neg ones I thought to myself... They probably just didn't use it right... Well.... It really doesn't work, I didn't e even see any gunk in the cleanser and my black heads and white ones r still in my pores... Lucky it's not that expensive but still feel like wasted money"
2,I wouldn't waste my money...again.,"I bought this with the hopes of actually making a change to my skin. I have very large pores and Biore strips were getting expensive and not to mention, they don't do the best job. It seemed to sort of work in the beginning but after a while it really just seemed like I had to put pressure on my skin to actually get the cleanser to work, which defeats the purpose of the product entirely."
4,Good Product,Good product but needs to be more power for suctionfor that I will give him 4 Stars onlythank you
4,Edit: This thing can be useful,"I am pretty much just agreeing with everyone else here, but felt the need to post because this product really is one of the more worthless ones that I have purchased in recent memory. You're better off sticking with nose strips and the like.EDIT:I dug this out and charged it for an experiment. The results were extremely positive: this thing is very good for preparing your nose for using a Biore nose strip. The sucking action loosens the blackhead material in the pores and, although it is not strong enough to pull them out completely on its own, it does work wonders when coupled with a nose strip.I would say that this was the most successful nose strip session that I have ever had, and it is completely thanks to the Panasonic pore sucking device thing. Bravo."
1,Very dissappointed!!!!,I brought this product thinking it would suck up and clear the pores on my face and nose area. Boy!!! Am I disappointed!!! I agree with most of the earlier reviewer it doesn't do much of anything besides giving you the feel of a light suction on your skin. Which is not enough to suck out any clogged pores. The one I have runs for about a week and the Mist pump stop working. Which make it useless now.
4,"Works great, needs realistic expectations","Here's the upshot from what I've noticed for me and some others.+It works best for people with moderate/serious sebum issues.+It works most effectively on the nose, but can be used elsewhere on the face (with less effect).+The steaming/warming your face is kinda a double-edged sword. More steaming = more pore opening, but also softer skin susceptible to irritation when the cleanser starts sucking against it. Be sure to have enough warm water to loosely open your pores though, at the very least. +Personally I've found a warm 30s to 1min face wash perfectly fine for me.+Be sure to make your skin moist! Cleaning your skin will take a few minutes, and I've found that I had to reapply warm water generally a few times.It ain't perfect, but it sure serves me well."
2,"Oy, vey!","It will indeed give your face little dark purple marks if you hold it in one place too long, ladies. And you'll have to use cover up for at least 2-3 days afterwards, which will increase your chances of getting even more blackheads...So does it work? After three weeks of using it 2-3 times per week, I'm not really sure. The suction cup looks like it's taken in a few blackheads(ew! but better there than in my pores...), so it has to be doing something. But when I look at my face, all I can think is that I'm better off squeezing them with my fingers!Oh, and even though there's a mister, if you fill it up with hot water, it still comes out cold and closes up your pores. Go figure."
1,Negative does not work,"Don't waste your money, I tried it several times and it barely worked but when I pinched my skin it released all the stuff in my pores"
1,Does not Perform,"I must warn any future buyers. This item simply does not work. I bought this product for my daughter for a holiday gift. When we she went to use it (after a full charge) it simply did not work. The suction is no where as strong as it needs to be to remove anything from pores, even those not really clogged. Buyer beware."
2,um. .. .,"used it just as directed, but didnt appear to do anything. i know i have little pores, but nothing??? first time using a product like this, wont be wasting any more money. . .. ."
1,Not strong enough to do anything.,Not enough vacuum power to remove any blackheads. The mister also seemed to stop working after 1 use. Not worth the hassle.
4,pretty good,"i bought this product for my girlfriend. according to her, this product does its job, however, like others said, it cannot replace strips, and it is good for regular cleaning. so, 80% effective when using it after shower."
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased a facial steamer along with this to help keep my pores open and face wet while using this product. I used this several times, and with the steamer got my skin hot and wet, but this product does absolutely nothing. As far as other users saying it needs good grip to get the right amount of suction, I had this thing pulling my skin up into the small opening, but nothing cleaned out of my pores. Get a good cleaner, a soft facial brush, and the mud masks (that you mix from a powder) to get your pores clean. I did keep my steamer because I loved the way it softens your skin and helps with absorbing lotions. This is garbage."
3,Works for certain skin types.,"It didn't really work out for me, I've used it a couple times and theres no results.But, it did work for my cousin amazingly. So I guess it depends on the skin type."
4,****AWSOME****,This product works excellent. I love it and would recommend it. Follow specific instructions and there should be no problem at all with it.
5,Great,"I am very pleased with this product. You do need to open your pores before using, as in any other case, when using such a product. Cam very quick, before specified time, which made me very happy."
3,"It Works, But Helpful to Use with Second Product","I just used this and can recommend it.So the good part was that it worked pretty well to loosen up a lot of the clogged pores. It kinda pulled half of the bad stuff out. Since it didn't fully do the trick, I followed it with a Biore strip, which finished the job. Usually, a Biore strip works fairly well on me, but leaves a lot of stuff behind.From using both together, nothing was left behind. Between the two products, my pores are cleaner than they have ever been."
1,"Doesn't work, but Amazon made it easy to return","I tried it several times right after I got out of the shower. I use the smaller end, and went slowly. It definitely had a good suction, and it felt good, but it did not clean my pores. My pores looked just as clogged after using it, and the vacuum hadn't collected any gunk.However, Amazon made it very easy to return. Shipping was free via USPS. All I needed was a printer for the return mail label. Trying it for yourself will only waste your time, not your money.(I wish Amazon let me give it zero stars.)"
1,Really?,Don't even bother. It doesn't clean pores so whats the point of even owning it??? I returned mine.
1,Don't waste your money,"This product is pointless, don't waste your money. It doesn't do anything significant. I tried to return it to get my money back but I was past the return date. Invest in a good pore cleansing scrub or Biore pore strips but don't waste your money on this!!"
2,Didn't do anything.,Not even close to worked. Gave it to a friend who wanted to try it out. I would have better luck removing dirt by rubbing my face into a pile of mud.
3,none of the reviewers seem to have followed the directions,"I have never used this product, but i'm very curious about it. The directions say that with CONTINUED REGULAR USE you will notice cleaner pores. Most reviewers are negatively rating this after one or two tries, or once a week use. why?? Is there anyone who has used this regularly who can give a real review? I would love to know if this thing works."
1,Haven't got my product yet.,I've used this product before and it works well. So I ordered my own here on amazon. That was about a month ago and I still haven't received my product. This is because it had the wrong address on it and was sent back. I checked and the address on my account is right. I couldn't find a costumer service number on this website to call so i called ups and they said they shipped it but the address on the package was missing the last digit of my apartment number. Please help. I would like the product reshipped to me since I've already payed for it.-Hannah Eisenberg
1,"I read the instructions, Doesn't work ppl here said it work is ppl that doesn't know how to use it LIES!","I use it after my steam facial and fail this cant suction a thing it cant suction a thing is a fail product dont waste your money on this.I bought this cuz the ppl saying is ppl that doesn't read the instruction or doesn't know how to use it, lame it cant suction a thing = this product is a scam at best!"
2,Not that great,"I had high hopes for this product. Maybe too high. I make sure I wash my face and get my skin nice and soft before I use it. I do notice a difference in my pores after I have used it. HOWEVER, the results only last about 24 hours. So then I'm right back where I started. I don't have the time to do this every single day. What I had hoped for was that I would notice the difference for a few days to a week, not 24 hours.So, when I have an event coming up, or a special occasion, that is when I use this product, to give me a little boost in how my skin looks."
2,Not very impressed.,"Nice idea but not very effective. The micro fine mist feature on this product worked for only the first few times I used it. Now even though the product is filled with water, nothing comes out."
1,It sucks. No pun intended.,This didn't work for me. It didn't clear a single pore after following the directions and using it in the shower like some others people. Did not have any luck with it.
2,Not strong enough,"I bought it, it pulled a few but guess my pores is too deep. I ended buying in addition a blackhead tool for about 7$ and it was fabulous."
3,Useful,"A handy product, cleans pore pretty well but not the best. I've never really tried other products so this is the best for me so far!"
3,effectiveness depends on steaming the face,"This works, but not great. The mister is useless. I basically have to stand inside the shower for half an hour until my pores open to use this. Then I have to make multiple circular passes to get something out of my face. It seems to work the best on the forehead and around the mouth, since there is a hard surface behind the skin there. Doing the nose is extremely difficult and it really doesn't work because of the shape of your nose. Sadly, there isn't much better you can do with an at-home tool than this. It takes way too much time for the entire process of opening your pores and making passes with the tool to do this every day. Maybe once a week."
4,It's OK,"This product is OK. You can feel the suction. It didn't really remove any blackheads but I think it might have ""loosend"" them to make them easier to remove. I was worried that because it wasn't high priced that it might not have decent suction but it does. The mist option was nice. You can have it off or on. I had a pore cleaner before so I already knew not to leave it too long in one place. It was ok for me. I have really huge pores that get blackheads all the time, so between my facials and all the other products I use, this is just another tool that I think helps. If someone asked, I would say go ahead and try it."
2,not worth the $,"I thought this would be a cool product to create a spa-like feeling at home....I haven't used the mister, but I bought the Conair steamer that was suggested. The suction is strong and actually works, but only around my nose. I would rather use Biore strips than have this product taking up space in my house. All-in-all, I could do without it!"
4,Actually works,This actually works. I bought it for myself and my pimply faced teen. You MUST wash your face and either steam of sit a hot towel on your face first. This opens the pores and softens the oil so it can be removed. Caution overuse will stimulate the sebaceous (oil) glands and you will get more pimples. My son was using it daily and it happened to him. Now I limit him to three times per week. Olive or dark skinned people must also use caution because overuse can cause darkening of the skin.
1,Seriously Ridiculous,"I followed instructions = No Results, I got creative and steamed my face for a much longer time = No ResultsThis has very weak suction, and the only thing it will suck up is a couple of dead skin cells.PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY, DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS PRODUCT."
4,Good Product,"This product is easy to use and functions very well. I do not have many blackheads so I don't see much after using it. However, I have used it on someone with oilier skin and we could see the build up that came out on the tool. It doesn't take very long to use either, which is nice."
3,It is fine. You just have to know how to use it.,"I bought this product and I started to use after taking a shower. I could see some whitehead and blackhead coming out. Unfortunadely, not all white head come out imediately with one stoke. YOu have to give a massage many time in the same area in order to work. It is also bad to massage the same area many time because the skin will get redness. I ended up like a vampire because I massage the right side below my lower lips and my skin in that area turn out to become red. I think, I need more practice in using this product. I am positive that in the next tries, I will know how to use it better. The good thing is that I can see my blackheads coming out from my face. You only need some patience in doing this. You have to be very careful to not overuse it. Otherwise, your skin will turn red."
2,Doesn't live up to its standard,"I bought this product a few months ago, hoping it would loosen the extra sebum stored in my pores, particularly my nose and T-zone.The product looked very convincing and I liked the idea.I tried it and it hardly removed/loosened the extra sebum in my pores. I even used it after I steamed my face and right after I got out the shower.Hardly sucked much at all. A negligible amount of sebum was removed, not even as affective as using my fingers wrapped around tissue to push the extra gunk out.I have dry/combo skin, so probably that might have been a factor to not attaining a fabulous result but the box clearly states it is suitable for all skin types.I wouldn't waste your money on this.. The suction does not suck. (No pun intended)"
2,Should have taken advice other posted,"Don't know what I was thinking. I had read other reviews, but went ahead and bought it anyway. Now it just sits in its craddle. I tryed using it a few times, really did nothing for me. I should have taken the advice that was posted on other reviews."
1,This thing is horrible.,This thing is absolutely WORTHLESS. My pores are HUGE and I can get over a hundred pore plugs with a Biore strip. I may have cleaned one pore after 5 minutes of trying with this piece of junk. I returned it. I have no clue why anybody is reviewing this as good. Do yourself a favor and wash your face REGULARLY and use a Biore strip when things get bad.
4,*Newsflash* Pore Cleanser-Cleanses Pores ^^,I've purchased this pore cleanser because I was in dire need of something that worked well all the time. My pores have gotten pretty big over the years and the cleansers just seem to get rid of mostly just the surface oils when the problem was deeper. I haven't had this long enough for it to have done what I bought it for (making my pores shrink)But it definitely cleans out the pore a lot deeper than any other method I've used before. I am rating this a 4 star only because I've not used it long enough. If it works well enough I will give another comment with a 5 star rating.
1,Junk,"Despite following the many helpful user reviews from people who felt this product worked well for them I am still completely unsatisfied. I've steamed my face, washed it with cleanser, kept the surface moist and all I get with this pathetic little sucker is a little dead skin off the surface. It does NOT extract any blackhead NOR does it have any effect on a whitehead no matter the size. The suction is simply too weak on too large of an area even when using the small tip. Please, save your money."
2,Not Strong Enough,"The suction power is not strong enough to remove any blackheads. I barely feel the suction on my face, and didn't notice any difference after use."
2,"good product, stopped working QUICKLY",within 2 weeks of my purchase this item stopped working. contacted customer service and was SOL since i had disposed of the box already
3,broke,"i love this product, the way it feels gliding over ones face as it vacuums up the dead skin cells so when one broke (power turns on but it doesnt provide suction), i ordered another and that one broke, with the same problem, within a month."
1,Not what I expected,"I came across this and it sounded like it would be perfect for getting some annoying blackheads out and making my pores look smaller. Maybe I had too high of expectations, but this product sucked. I have pretty nice skin from the start but this didn't seem to do anything but squirt water on my face. This has already made its way into the Goodwill donation pile. I'm glad I didn't spend more on it, but hey, at the very least, the suction does feel kind of cool and more relaxing than anything. It might work for you, but don't spend much money on it."
3,It seems to work,"I seems to work. I use it on my wet face per reviewers instructions. I think the larger side works better for me, but you should try both sides. I bought this for my blackheads and I do notice residue in the cup after I am finished. When I use the pore cleanser my face looks better and I can tell the difference when I don't use it. I gave it three stars because it doesn't remove everything right away. You need to use it daily. Other than that I don't have a problem with it. The suction is good and it works more or less as advertised."
4,Nice beauty tool.,"I first saw this product at The Sharper Image and it caught my eye. I found one here at amazon.com for half as much as the price in the store. I bought it for myslef as a gift to myself for xmas. I got a little worried when I read the review here saying it could only be used on the nose but after reading the intsructions I found it could be used on the whole face. The first time I used it it felt slightly sore while using the pore cleanser. I used it after I got out of the shower and washed my face. It made my skin very soft but afterwords I used Murads toner, liquid exfoliator, and moisturizer and my skin has been great. I only use it once a week but boy does it make my face look and feel clean."
1,Don't waste your money,This product did absolutely nothing no matter what I did.Followed the directions to a tee...still did not work.Maybe I got a defective one.It is still in the bathroom drawer.
2,skin cleaner,with the suction it creates you would think it would suck out your blackheads but it didn't for me. It also irritated my skin more I think.
4,Good product,"You definitely feel the suction. As long as you don't use it too often, I'm sure it wont irritate your skin. So far, I think that it works quite well. Don't stay at one spot for too long. If your white/black heads don't get removed on some places don't force it - It will come out eventually. Good product, relatively easy to clean, and make sure you air dry the product when you can."
1,Disappointing,"I bought this thinking it would be a solution to just using my fingernails to press blackheads out. However the lack of power is so obvious that even after a long hot shower when blackheads are almost popping themselves out it doesn't work. It's the same as doing nothing. It's just ridiculous, apparently was never tested on anyone before releasing."
4,Yes it Does Work but Don't Expect Instanly Clean Pores,It does work but it's going to take regular use to work everything out. It's definitely sucked notable stuff out of the pores on my face each use. It works best if your skin has just been washed in hot water to soften it and open the pores more. I'll leave an update of how it's working over time...
1,"Doesn't Work, Don't Get It","I saw this product being advertised on TV. They were showing the cleanser actually sucking out all the blackheads/sebum/dirt/etc from someone's pores. I thought it was amazing.I found out that someone I knew already bought the cleanser, and she said that it didn't work at all. I ordered the Panasonic anyway. Big mistake.The vacuum on this thing is way too weak to suck out anything from your pores. All it does is irritate your skin, usually leaving red marks that may last over a week.Don't buy this product. It's a waste of money and time.Some of the reviewers made suggestions on how to use it correctly. I tried, but no luck.One good thing came out of this cleanser though. My brother used it on a pesky pimple on his nose. The Panasonic popped it, and now it's gone. According to the instructions, you're not supposed to use this on pimples. I guess he was just lucky."
2,Not worth it,"I bought this thinking it would be a good way to routinely clean my facial pores, however the suction isnt ample enough to do a good job. The misting feature does create a better seal with the suction cup tho, and it does make it a little bit easier. Overall I would just suggest a good facial cleanser and cloth or Biore facial strips."
3,so so,less damaging to the skin then many products time consuming to use best used for long term results will continue using
1,Save Your Money!!,What a waste. Doesn't work. i got it for my clogged pores (little bumps) and blackheads. DOESN'T WORK AT ALL ON EITHER. its been sitting in my bathroom drawer just taking up space...very disappointed in this product.
2,Not really impressed with this item.,This product doesn't remove my comedones. I have used it several times. It does take some practice to use it correctly. It does have enough suction to pull some comedones up but not out. I tried steaming my face after showering and different products that soften them hasn't helped either. I am going to continue to use it hoping eventually it will make a difference.
4,average product,"The product arrived very quickly via the mail, and was well packaged and undamaged.The product sort of does what it is meant to, although the tough little black heads you still have to give a bit of a squeeze after you have used the hand held machine."
5,Love my pore cleaner!,"This is a replacement for the same item, which I purchased ten years ago from Sharper image. I loved it, used it every day,told everyone how great it was. I always thought it'll be a sad day when it stops working, Finally, it went the way of all electronic things. I tried for a year to buy a replacement, but no one carried them. Didn't thinkink of checking on Amazon until recently. So happy to have a way to clean my pores again!"
2,Does not work. I tried all the methods.,"You will be better off with a blackhead remover.Revlon Stainless Steel Blackhead Remover. This item just doesn't do much on its own. The only way to get anything with it is to use the head just like a cheap blackhead scraper like the one above. In fact, you will get better performance from the blackhead scraper.I don't know why this thing has positive reviews. My wife tried it too so it's not just me.The only reason it gets 2 stars is because it's the first product I've ever seen with built in induction charging, and for the geek in me, that's cool."
4,Be Careful,"Be careful. It isn't strong enough to pull out building clogs or pimples. It doesn't help with ingrown hairs in the sideburns/ beard area. It won't pull out any build-up around your nose.But it WILL give you a hickey in ALL of those places. So when you feel it's under-powered and spend more time in an area, you may realize too late that you have a hickey on your face."
3,Good guitar pop,"Death Metal? I have no idea what the previous reviewer is talking about. This is guitar oriented pop. Not hard on the ears at all. As the editrial review says, it is unique, as well. It is somewhat to contempory British pop bands like South, Stereophonics and Elbow, at least compared to death metal.This was one of my favorite albums back in the 80's. The sound holds up well today. Heaven and You Make Me Feel are the highlights in my book. The album, as a whole, can get a little monotonous, though.I give it three stars, but should give it higher because it seems everyone rates everything a 5 unless it's terrible. I would have probably given it a 4 ten years ago. But I'd by this again and recommend it to anyone who likes the style (if you like one song on this album, you'll like them all), but I can't say it's for everyone."
3,Buy Giant album instead,"This is a good album, however, if you are a casual fan I would highly recommend purchasing the ""Giant"" album which is 5 star."
4,Very good CD for the genre,"Many catchy tunes on this CD. Worth a look at if you into the whole ""mid-late 80's MTV 120 minutes"" type music."
2,What happened?,"This recording represents one of the biggest dropoffs in quality of any group I can remember. Heck, at least the Stone Roses took five years to work up a stink before releasing their marginal followup to the debut. The Woodentops ""Giant"" album is easily one of the highlights of the 1980s. Quirky, melodic and fun. It's still an album I play 20 years later with hardly any face-scrunching due to clunky 80's drums & synths.But with ""Wooden Footcops"" it seems that all sense of what made The Woodentops click on earlier albums simply vanished. The songs are dull and sound dated. Scott Litt was nailing REM production duties at the same time so I doubt it was all his fault. Anyone who has this album and thinks it's good should immediately go back one album and find yourself amazed by the difference.The only reason I hold onto this CD is because of the first track ""Maybe It Won't Last"". It's the only thing that connects them to past pleasures. (I haven't heard the bonus tracks)"
2,The Woodentops Aren't As Good As N'Sync,"I found out about this death metal band called The Woodentops when i saw their claymation video for ""Wheels Turning"" on TRL. i decited to buy the Wooden Foot Cops LP and to my suprise, these songs are about suicide. ""What You Give Out"" and ""Wheels Turning"" are my only favorites on here. the other songs just scare me way too much. i suggest you buy No Strings Attached by N'Sync instead. thank you."
4,An Excellent Overall Jazz History Sampler,"I'm a chromatic harmonica fan. Toots Thielemans set the standard for exciting use of this musical instrument for jazz lovers. The chormonica was not his main instrument in his early years as I understand but jazz guitar. You will find him playing guitar on some cuts, chormonica on others cuts, and surprisingly he's even known to just whistle in soloing. A cut or two as I recall have demos of that.I think some of these recordings are in mono rather than in stereo for those of you who can remember what that is but that only helps establish that he's been around a long time. In short, if you want to hear from a great jazz musician legend who just plain loves his music this is an album for you. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because as I said at the start, I'm a chromonica fan and all the cuts are not Toots playing that instrument. Still, a must have album though."
4,"Elvis Presley, the life the man etc.",Product was shipped in a timely manner. THe book itself was everything that I had hoped it would be and more. Excellent choice.
1,Not much new and a bit one sided,"The book is gushing to a fault in its praise of Elvis. Drug involvement is all but brushed aside. Organization leaves something to be desired, and there is no subject index. Captions for photographs are listed in the back. Chronology is very loose; it was difficult knowing when some events took place. References to Jackie Onassis, Audry Hepburn, and JFK, on the whole, added little.Priscilla's voice seemed loud and clear. While that helped in understanding her relationship with Elvis, it made the book appear one-sided. Still, Elvis' intense relationship with Ann-Margret was acknowledged.There were some interesting new details, but very few. I wondered what compelled the author to write the book. Perhaps hearing the old stories in a new publication, or by a new author makes them fresh again. There are always new books on Elvis, and I find myself buying one more."
4,Elvis is Cool,"The book is an intersting read, not a tour de force, but compelling, the pictures are fantastic and the stories about people that were a part of Elvis' life are neat. Bernard Lansky his clothier who fancied up a young Elvis in cool shades of black pink and other colors. The author writes in her own way to give the reader a glimpse of never heard information along with already known news, but if you are a fan of the King, this is a must have for your collection."
5,A First Class Book!,Ms Keogh does an incredible job of giving us a closer look at the icon Elvis Presley. The book is graced with beautiful photographs and wonderful stories. It gives the reader insights as to why Elvis is still loved and adored by his fans. A must-have for your personal library.
5,A riveting and fresh take on The King,"A brilliant literary tour de force, this book offers a fresh take on Elvis, explaining why he still matters today (and probably always will). Told in an energetic style, it has the crackling narrative drive of a great novel. Fans will adore it; it's a beautiful book, full of stunning black-and-white photos of the King, some seldom seen. And it will delight anyone interested in the style secrets of an icon, from his clothes to his Graceland furniture. The coolest book on Elvis ever."
5,Common Sense For a New Father,"I enjoyed reading the book. I have used many of the ideas from Dr. Sears book to raise my two children. I own five other fathering books but this is by far the best and most practical one.Lets face it, there is little support or literature for fathering. I think society expects men to raise their children just like our dads did. Most of the available fathering literature is written by men with one or two children and psychology degrees. Dr. Sears has six kids and is a busy pediatrician.Especially if you are a first time father, do your child a favor. Buy and read this book."
3,Informative... but dated,Great book for a father. I'm sure it was tops in the eighties when it was still able to relate to the social styles of the era... I gained some insight but felt like there is more to learn from a newer book....
2,"Rosario Tijeras, a cut below","Maybe it's the translation, but I doubt it.This book is just a mess. It's a long string of cliches about the title ""bad girl"", who is such a one-dimensional creation that, by the end of the book, I was just waiting for her to be gone. Not one character is fully realized and the narrator's passion/obsession with the title character is never well developed.Jorge Franco is a very talented writer and has an amazing reputation in Colombia. This book seems to be just something he tossed onto paper in order to get a check. Might have made a good comic book. That's about all it really is."
3,Rosario Tijeras,"This isn't the most well written story, but I enjoyed reading it all the same. I find that the authors makes the expression of feelings seem effortless. He describes the love with such precision that I found myself amazed at times for I have felt that way before. If your a sucker for tragic love stories then this story is for you."
1,A darkly realistic and uncommonly poor novel,"If you are interested in reading an endless devotional to a woman with no redeeming qualities whatsoever, this is your book. The author provides no explanation, explicit or implicit, as to why the narrator is so smitten, while creating a truly unattractive and unpredictable personality in his title character. The novel may be representative of a new style of ""darkly realistic urban novels"" but that does not make a bad book good."
2,question,When will my book come and why hasnt it be shipped i need some answers i am worriedHello is anyone there
5,A Treasure!,"This is a tremendous book. Not only does it give hope to fallen leaders and those who love and serve under them, it also gives great encouragement to each individual in the body of Christ. We all have dead things in our lives in need of God's restoring power and this book speaks truth to the lies satan and the world tells us regarding the possibility of healing and restoration for our broken places. The world and the church sometimes looks on the sins of others with hopelessness and judgment while God looks on the ruins of our life with compassion. Only someone who was in need of this compassion and the revelation of the absolute restoring power of God could write this book. How refreshing it is to read a book by someone who goes beyond the mere knowledge of restoration to share the pain and ultimate joy of living in the restoring power of God. Before you give up on a situation in your life or the life of another, read this book!"
4,A Good Historical Text,"The best part about this book is that Evans offers a historical text which is an alternative to the histories printed by other researchers and writers of the past. His links to other texts, etymologies and traditions is quite substantial and his application of this learning to modern day times in the Western world is still appropriate today, even though this book was written in the 1970's. The only drawback is that he advocates the use of violence in activism in order to get the gay/witchcraft point across, and although this may just be a sign of the time when this book was written, it does put a bit of a dampener on the rest of the text, especially when taking into consideration the wiccan rede. However, this book is a must read for any witch studying history, or any lesbian, gay or bisexual person trying to trace their historical roots."
3,Learning,"This was my first purchase of first ed. and signed, local dealer laughed when I showed her,condition was not great and I should have ask more questions from the dealer,was over charged for the overall condition."
4,Affordable antqiues: less for more,"This book was wonderful. I have been antiquing for about 15 years now and wish I had this book when I started. It gives you advice on how to bargin with dealers and how to handle auctions. It also gives you some good advice on how to look for the sleepers at garage sales and also at thrift stores. Very well written. Could hardly put it down! Few pictures and not much detail on marks and how to really tell an orginal from a repoduction. But for some one just getting their feet wet and who only want to spend a few dollars, this book is well worth it."
5,The Secrets to Affordable Antiques,"Frank Loomis knows his stuff. This is the easiest book to follow, the best advice for newcomers to antiquing, and packed with valuable information for everyone who has ever found an interesting article in the attic. Frank has obviously worked very hard to acheive this amazing book. I will now start my collecting with a valuable asset in my back pocket, The Secrets to Affordable Antiques.Ann Brandt, author of Crowfoot Ridge, HarperCollins 1999"
1,Buyer beware...This is a discontinued model with defects,"I happened to purchase this unit in late Sept 2004 and found the unit to have electronic switch defect (the LCD would not switch off with the remote controller and regular screen display would disappear and change into a rotating color screens of red, blue and green.I got a replacement unit (from the US distributor; so called reboxed unit, said to be a new unit but with a broken box) which had the same electronic defect.Then I was told this model had been discontinued (probably because of the electronic defect) and one month later, I was forced to take a cheaper LCD substitue N3000W which has display problem of its own. See my review on N3000W.If you plan to purchase this unit from any vendor, make sure you can return it for full refund. Do not send the unit to the US distributor in CA for replacement unit. You will not get any. The US distributor would not give you any refund."
1,Not very good! Judge a book by it's cover!,"When I first picked up the CD, I felt the artwork looked slapped together in haste and thoughtlessness...I should have know that what was on the inside, was equally thoughtless!I personally think ""Farewell"" is their true masterpiece!I'm super surprised at the steep drop creativity between these two records.""Breaking point"" is full of the same tired electronic sounds and music patterns that we've heard for the past 15 years now.While the lyrics are even more obvious, and at times embarrassing!!!On a nit picky note, the production sounds crummy too. My bet is almost all instruments were soft (computer based) synths.D-sides at best!!TRY HARDER!!!!!!"
3,Good...but not their best,"Although a bit calmer than the past few recordings from Clan Of Xymox, it does have a few engaging moments. I think the best track is Be My Friend.Ronny's voice is as rich as ever, it just the songs are a little flat. Kind of tired sounding in feel.Clan Of Xymox has issued some masterpieces, but this one isn't one of them. It's good, but just in an average sort of way. It has been compared to the early yeas of Clan Of Xymox, but I couldn't see that. This is present day Clan without the EBM/ Electro in it.Buy it if you are a Clan fan, but if you're looking to get something from them, get Farewell, Hidden Faces, or Songs From The Underground"
2,Okay but not great.,"I have been a fan of Xymox for years now so it's no suprise that I am not a huge fan of their new stuff. I hated Notes from the underground and Farewell. After listening to this one I think it is a little better than Farewell. Although it is kind of boring. It doesn't really seem to go anywhere, it just kind of lags on and on to the point where I just kept hitting the skip button after the second time through the album."
5,a classic of American history writing,"Bernard Devoto wrote before the mavens of political correctness had the power to harm honest research and writing, so it is to be expected that some contemporary readers would be hurt and confused by his frank and realistic depiction of the west of the fur trappers. Devoto spent years researching this classic, then presented his findings in polished prose that evoked the period and the wild life of his subjects. This, like all of his historical works, is worth reading more than once."
4,Detailed description of the Fur Trade and Mountain Men,A detailed description of the Fur Trade that opened the West to further settlement. Discusses the lifestyles of the mountain trappers and the devotes a great deal of time to the business end of the trade
2,NEEDS WORK,"I AGREE W/NAICHE. AUTHOR HAS(HAD) GOOD COMMAND OF SUBJECT MATTER BUT PRESENTS IT IN A MADDENINGLY DISORGANIZED MANNER. POORLY INTRODUCED PERSONAGES & EVENTS SEGUE THROUGH EACH CHAPTER NOT TO BE ADEQUATELY DISCUSSED (IF AT ALL) UNTIL MANY PAGES LATER. I FOUND MYSELF FLIPPING AHEAD & BACK IN FRUSTRATION TRYING TO MAINTAIN CONTINUITY. MR. DeVOTO SEEMS MORE CONCERNED WITH DEMONSTRATING HIS LITERARY WIT THAN CLEARLY PRESENTING HIS SUBJECT MATTER. I FOUND ROBERT UTLEY'S ""A LIFE WILD AND PERILOUS"" FAR EASIER TO READ & LEARN FROM."
5,Loved this book!,"Sunset has published several books on this subject, 3 of them called ""Complete Masonry"" with different subtitles and a basic one, possibly others. This is the only one that I've actually gone through cover to cover and it is superb. I have the Black and Decker flavor of Complete Masonry too and this one is far better at 1/2 the price.The projects described are quite a bit more appealing than the B&D's plain cookie cutter boring wall and walkway offerings. More importantly this book offers better techniques of design that can be applied to your own unique design.Another of my favorites on the subject of concrete that is also applicable to walls, walkways, flooring or whatever else you wish to conjure is a book called ""Concrete Countertops: Design, Form, and Finishes for the New Kitchen and Bath"" It actually offers much more than what the title leads you to believe and suggests concrete as a very versitle replacement for standard brick and tile uses of the past."
3,Meh,Heavy on decorative techniques light on the building techniques. Reads more like a landscape architect book than a builders book. I was expecting more application to homes instead of landscaping. I guess I should have known when part of the title was decorative concrete. I think part of it should be at least some structural references.. meh
3,Title should be Landscape Masonry.,"Not a lot about masonry, but a lot about outdoor stone / brick landscaping in warm climates. The pictures can give you ideas about landscape projects."
2,Waterproof? Nope,"Well, after one day of getting water on my Garmin... it stopped working. Everything was sealed and locked up tight, but it got mosture inside the screen and stopped working >:["
4,Good choice for entry level GPS,"Garmin eTrex Venture is a good entry level choice for genreal purpose. It is not too pricy and is very easy to use. Good reception outdoor. The battery life is sufficient and it came with many good features such as recording tracks and sunrise sunset time as well as area calculation. It is also very accurate in terms of plotting your location and calculating your heading and speed. The only down side is poor reception when inside the car. You have to point it close to the window and possibly have to row it down if you have dark sunscreen. Or you have to sit in front seat and place the unit right under the windshield. The memory is also quite limited with 1MB. However, if your main purpose is not for driving navigation, I highly recommand this unit because its easy to use and fair price."
5,Good for sailors,"I bought this unit for 2 reasons: (1) to ensure that I know where I am when the fog rolls in; (2) to know if sail adjustments increase my speed.The GPS fulfills both of these needs. It is very easy to use and very well engineered.It has some features that I don't need, such as fishing info, but the less expensive model looks less sophisticated, based on my examination of the users' manual.Also, the WAAS capability is not available on the less expensive model (although I haven't been able to get to WAAS satelites)."
4,A Good Soundtrack for a good movie,"This album has a lot of variety. Theres the whole british invasion going on, ex-devo boy mark mothersbaugh, and a lot of other good stuff. I only had one problem. The who's ""A Quick One While He's Away"" is NOT the one that appears in the film!!!! The one in the movie is more grainy, maybe a later version or a live version. still it is a good song, just if you noticed in the movie, its a little confusing. The version on the album does appear on the trailer. STILL A VERY GOOD CD! BUT IT!"
2,not what's in the movie....again,"Great movie, good sound track, but wheres the Rolling Stones..""WAIT"" and some other songs from the movie not on the cd.. Amazon do more research.. Thanks"
4,Withstands repeated vigorous listenings!,"As others have already pointed out (a long time ago, but it bears repeating), a great mix!Only disappointment on the disk is the Nothing in The World cut by The Kinks, with it's vocals driven into clipping at a few points. Ironically, cheaper sound systems actually sound worse as they struggle to deal with this issue. A very minor point to be sure, and I assume it came from the original tracks like that, because the rest of the album sounds great.I've always liked the one-hit wonder Concrete & Clay by Unit 4+2. If you do too, I'd suggest not trying too hard to find anything else by them. If you do manage to find one of their albums, be open-minded because apparently whoever wrote Concrete & Clay left the room leaving the rest of their tunes never hitting that fun hook again.Buy it today! I command you!"
3,A Rather Fair Balance,"I like soundtracks that weave in the scoring as well as the soundtrack numbers. Unsurprisingly The Royal Tenenbaums soundtrack has the same balance. I wonder if Wes Anderson prefers this as well. There are some great classics that are gathered together on this album, to name a few: Here Comes My Baby (Cat Stevens), Oh Yoko (John Lennon), Ooh La La (The Faces), and the lovely beat of Concrete & Clay (Unit 4 + 2). I think this soundtrack really shows how picking the right support songs can really make a film work."
4,"Great music that makes you feel 15 again! (Way out, dude...)","The soundtrack of Rushmore is genuinely original, and as essential to this movie as the soundtrack of, let's say, any Tarantino movie. It really creates the right atmosphere, in this case the vividly colored feelings of a naive/idealistic adolescent. The theatrical score of Mark Mothersbaugh perfectly complements the rebellious British Invasion songs. Minus: neither the Donovan song (""Jersey Thursday""?) nor the early Stones song (""I am waiting"") are on the CD. Bummer..."
4,Flower Power No Match For Glower Power,"So far, many of the reviews coming in for this have been from people who saw the movie, loved it, didn't hear a song they were waiting for, etc. I haven't seen Rushmore yet, but as a testimony to the overall effect of what is essentially a great, themed road-tape set to some nearly was and almost rans of the 60's, I've decided to go see the fim-tonite! Also, a fine alternative choice for those of us who love the arcane garage rock, but can't afford the mega-spendy ""nuggets"" box set. MMM MMM, good!"
5,Even Better,"I purchased this to replace my Audio Cassette Tape. The CD sound is much better than my Cassette Tape. I should have done this sooner and yes it is still Chariots of Fire. Now if they would just put the movie on ""Blue Ray""."
1,Synthetic Leather Strap,"Purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my little sister, and unfortunately was not able to give this to her. This watch is advertised as having a leather strap (calfskin to be exact). When I received the watch and opened it, I noticed that the strap was hard manipulate. It was tough, and much shorter than I would have liked it to be. When I flipped the watch over it states right on the strap ""Synthetic leather"". Which of course explains why it was so difficult to maneuver the strap. Very disappointed in the false advertising and quality of the strap. The watch face itself is not bad looking, but the strap ruins the whole watch."
4,Thoroughly mystical,"Plenty of gorgeous compositions here. One listening to this beautiful double cd is plenty in one days time, unless you plan to anesthesize your senses from a super stessful day at work. Premium etereal ambient Steve Roach for sure."
3,"Its ""ok"" but nothing great. Not worth $75","I've had this since 2003 (bought for $26). I'm a HUGE horror movie/book fan. So I HAD to have a horror movie trivia game. Unfortunately I don't have anyone to play it with. I did get to play it 2-3 times and pulled out and read most of the trivia cards, and I wasn't impressed. There didn't seem to be many current horror movie questions. A lot of them were about rock & roll and silly things like that. If your looking for a game based solely on horror movies/books. Don't bother with this one. Especially for the $75 its going for right now as I write this."
5,Trivia with Horror Fans in Mind!,Got this for my cousin for Christmas. She is a big horror movie buff. She absolutely loved it.
3,Enjoyable,"Quite a nice story, didn't get you too involved that you couldn't put it down, but plesant enough. I read this based on a review that likened it to Easy Connections by Liz Berry - It didn't have nearly as much depth as Easy Connections and I found it was not a book that drew you into the stroy."
3,Awakened Mind System Review,"Hard to determine if this CD does in fact enhance a deepened state of consciousness, however, I do enjoy listening to the hour long CD while working and do seem to be more productive throughout the day. That said, I guess the dendrites are getting fired up in a pleasant and balanced kind of way?!"
4,"GREAT RELAXING SOUNDS, WIFE LOVES IT!!!","Great audio relaxing CD! Paid $8.50 shipped. Helps my wife relax from a rough day at work. The music helps relax your mind andgive you a restful mind. She uses it when tanning, before taking a nap, meditation and other times she is over stressed. A great gift idea!"
5,Does What It's Supposed To,"Handy item if you need a second connection. The only downside for me: While it still works with a Zen Vision:M, it's primarily designed to fit other, larger players, and I have to shuffle a bit to ""find"" the port/plug connection. Meh. Not a big deal. Otherwise, it's perfect."
5,The place to start -- first two Concord albums in one inexpensive package,"Disc one is Scott's 1977 debut, disc two is the equally strong follow-up from 1978. Scott's breathy and easy-going tenor sax will remind the listener of Coleman Hawkins, especially on slower standards like ""That's All"" and ""These Foolish Things,"" but there are echoes of Ben Webster and Dexter Gordon too. (These aren't bad names to drop when one considers Mr. Hamilton was only 22 at the time.) Bill Berry's on trumpet for the '77 set, and Cal Collins picks a hot accoustic guitar for the '78 sessions. Scott sounds equally at home swinging through ""Love Me Or Leave Me"" as he is playing brass tag with Berry on Rodgers and Hart's ""Blue Room."" Nat Pierce (piano), Monty Budwig (bass) and Jake Hanna (drums) set a sympathetic, relaxed mood for Mr. Hamilton's solos. Having these two early albums in one package is a real bargain for tenor sax fans."
5,Sencillo y bueno,"Al igual que los anteriores de Miguel ruiz como los 4 acuerdos es super sencillo este libro, hay veces que de tan sencillo en mi caso hay que hacer paradas para recapitular, es de muy buena compania en tu buro y por supuesto de los que no hay que dejar de hojear y regalar a cualquier persona que uno estima"
4,Back to my boyhood,"This book was an iconic ""coming of age"" requirement in the late 40's. Just receiving it brought back a lot of memories. Re-reading it however, showed how what was thought of as lurid back then, through the eyes of an 11 year old, is really very tame by today's standards."
2,Out dated,I must admit that I last read this while in high school in the late 50's! You can guess my age from that! I found the book to be really outdated and not worth re-reading. Very little nostalgia even though I was familiar with all the geographic locations in NYC.
3,Was It Translated From French To Greek?,"I went to a reasonably good university, and got 580 on verbal SATs, but I can't seem to put the words of this translation together in a way that makes sense. So just to let you readers of average intelligence, like me, know before you spend your money, read the sample pages first. I can't give this book any stars because I don't know if it's any good."
1,The Emporer Wears no Clothes,Written in such ambigous and meaningless language (in translation) that there is nothing original or even meaningful here that isn't provided by the reader.
5,Exquisite Dido and Aeneas,"Susan Graham's performance of Dido is rich-toned, expressive--all you could ask for. The rest of the cast is also superb in this wonderful recording directed Emmanuelle Haim."
2,Tired......,"Have had enough of the sorry, negative gay-themed movies! Would like to see a positive gay-themed movie with a happy ending for once! Seriously tired of these ""down-and-out"" story-lines!"
3,Half a Person,it was OK but the story didn't seem to go anywhere. The whole story line seemed purposeless and what was accomplished was mediocre at best
1,POINTLESS,"The most deceiving trailer ever. The movie was the most pointless movie I had ever seen. Two friends, one gay n one straight, go on a road trip n pretty much argue the whole time. The straight guy has sex with one chick and the gay guy gets head by the other chick, they both go back home and the movie ends. WTF?!"
3,Beginning of a story,I did enjoy the film. The story line is fractured and needs to be fully developed. Would be interesting to see this script developed as a stage play and really give the characters a full back-story.
3,Its an OK book,"The Trolls is a pretty good book.The main charactors are Amanda, Melissa, Pee-Wee, and Aunt Sally.The kids parents go away on a buisness trip and Aunt Sally has to baby-sit the kids and while she is she tells the kids crazy stories about her and their father's childhood.One of the kid's favorite and most interesting is the story about the trolls.The reason I put 3 stars is because the book would have been better off with out the stupid stories told in between the story about the trolls like she would tell about the trolls tell about some other crazy story then go back to the rest of the story with the trolls. But other than that it was a pretty darn good book.Well that about sums up my story.Thats all folks!"
3,Give it a try,"I have just finished reading this book and sort of liked it.I couldnt really find the climax or the problem of the book. Aunt Sally, the aunt and babysitter for the Anderson family (since their old babysitter has gotten the boboes), has been telling these three kids, Pee Wee, Amanda, and Melissa stories about the trolls, Fat little mean girl, cougars, and much more, but i dont think it has anything to do with the problem of the story, which i cannot seem to figure out. But the stories she told were entertaining.You can give this story a try, but I dont highly reccommend it...there are other stories by Polly Horvath that you will enjoy."
4,Trolls You have to read it,"The Trolls, I know it doesn't sound exciting but you won't believe the stories that they tell. Their like stories in your wildest dreams. Let me tell you more, Melissa, Frank, and Amanda are getting babysat by their Aunt Sally. Aunt Sally is a great story teller! The funny thing is the stories she tells really happen to her and her 4 brothers and sisters. Well for you to know what the story is about read it yourself!"
3,A good book to pass the time,"not particularly beautifully written, but funny and witty. Polly Horvath has written a good book to read if you want a book where every story ends up happy and warm and fuzzy. All in all, though, I would recommend this book to anybody who likes a fun, happy read."
3,"Odd, Delightful, Wierd, Exciting, and.... Confusing At Times",Confusing and odd very odd... I give this 3 cause I liked the plott but understanding it was hard...
4,He Nailed It,"You need a little courage to think you can bring something new to a musician as singular as John Hurt. Morrissey does it by careful selection of songs with an emphasis on the humor and fun in Hurt's music, a good match. Peter Keane has always sounded like he's listened to Hurt all his life and plays beautifully here."
5,BILL !!!,I think Bill Morrissey is one of the best folks you can listen to when ya need a music fix. I am sad to say I will never see him do his thing on stage again. God speed Bill.
4,Average Singer - Great Album,"Bill Morrissey should never win prizes for his singing - but his guitar playing is way above most, and he has combined his talents to produce a wonderful tribute to Mississippi John Hurt. If you love blues (I'm guilty), this is an album you will listen to again and again. Morrissey does an excellent job of reproducing Hurt's driving, finger style guitar rhythms, and his somewhat rumbling vocals work exceptionally well with Hurt's songs.Highly recommended."
4,Comfy shoe,"I bought this shoe for a wedding, I was a bridesmaid and needed a silver sandal. It worked great, it was a garden wedding, so I was concern with the heel sinking into the dirt, it didn't to my joy. I was on my feet dancing throughout the night and never had an issue with discomfort. My only issue was the fact my feet kept sliding forward, but some inserts helped with that issue."
2,OKAY,"The shoe is pretty, but not very comfortable, and slides off your feet too easily and the heel is small so you really have to watch your balance."
4,Innovative Fun!,"Kids Camp offers innovative ideas to help kids of all ages keep busy during camp outings, even on raining days. Laurie Carlson offers 100+ original ideas, including instructions on concocting ""wilderness punch"" and writing with berry ink, guaranteed to entertain young campers. Whether you are organizing a scout campout, or camping in your own backyard, Kids Camp offers original and creative ideas, accompanied by great illustrations, to entertain and educate children and adults!"
4,A Good and pretty book,"I bought this book so I could plan ""Kid Camp"" one day a week with my two grandchildren. It offered good ideas and has good pictures. I'm glad I bought it."
2,Heavy on the Backyard,"There's a lot of mommy-targeted ""fun"" activities here but not too many for the woods.I'm still looking for the perfect family camping book."
5,great book,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book - in fact, the entire series, and am anxiously awaiting a sequel. Does anyone know if the author plans to do one???"
3,Pretty good.,"I think that this book is for the most part not so bad. It was as well thought out and as detailed as her past books, and the plot was just as enjoyable. However the ending was rather disappointing, and I consider it a very frustrating one if this is the very last book that she plans to write in the series."
2,"Good reference book, but not enough spice","Being a graduate from the Culinary Institute of America, I can tell you that this book is great for reference for freshness checks, seasonability but as for the recipes they dont always work and there are alot of mistakes. All in all a very good book, keep your eye out for the next edition, I heard it is more updated"
2,Wait a minute Don't get it Yet!,"I have used this book every day for the past 6 months. The chef instructors I have learned under have told me about 60% of the recipies don't work out. Pro chef 7 is in Recipe Testing NOW! Something that never happened to PC6. Be paitient PC7 will be 1,000 times better than this one!"
4,"My friends never knew I could cook, until now!","The New Professional Chef taught me how to cook. My friends are amazed at the delicious food I serve. I don't lack guests at my dinner parties. Every recipie I have tried works, but they don't always scale down well. In any case, the first half of the book is the ""meat and potatoes."" This is where you learn how to cook. Thank you, CIA!"
3,ponderous encyclopedia,"Excellent learning tool for technique and the characteristics of individual foods. It is a ""must have"" for the technical part alone; I refer to it weekly, but have yet to explore any of the recipes. If the book had been separated into two, one for techniques, the other for recipes; they would be very practical."
5,A Pleasure to Own,"I have owned the first edition for over 22 years now. It is the most used volume in my personal library during the last two decades. So comprehensive, so well designed."
4,Screws Worked Well for Me,"I bought these screws with a good bit of apprehension due to the other unfavorable review. The skepticism proved to be unfounded. I used these for attaching 3/4"" MDF underlayment to my 2"" pine subfloor. They worked great. Out of the thousand, I maybe had three or four heads break off. The square heads installed reliably. The few times they did not engage properly, I attributed to operator error, maybe getting to greedy about going too fast.I don't know why they did not work for the other reviewer. Maybe he got a bad batch. (or Maybe I got a good batch).- jwrit Boulder Colorado"
3,A Book of Its Time,"Interesting that an original version of this book is extremely hard to come by. The abridged version, as mentioned by another reader/reviewer, omits crucial references to the racist and anti-Irish underpinnings of this ""fairy tale."" The book was basically written as a critique of anti-slavery, anti-abolitionist sentiments stirring in Britain regarding it's colonies, which were still - after the abolition of the slave trade in 1807 - encouraging the slavery and mistreatment of black people. Read the book, but tell the children the truth, please."
4,Really helpful tool for astronomy reference.,"I purchased this for use at astronomy outreach events for my astronomy club. The globe has been very helpful at showing people the features they see on the the Moon using our telescopes. It serves that role very well.The globe seems solid and durable. The plastic stand makes it easy to demonstrate details around the globe. The globe includes very many craters, mountains, rilles and other details. There are labels for interesting locations such as the various manned and unmanned missions. It also shows the limits of the surface that is visible from Earth.Why only 4 stars? Sometimes there are so many names that some features are obscured. Also, the dark shading of the lunar maria is not indicated on the map -- the whole surface is the same shade of grey.Overall, this is a very good product for our use."
4,Moon Globe,Loved the moon globe...would make a wonderful gift to anyone intestered in studying the heavens...the moon phases in particular are so vivid with the globe...get out your telescope ( or not) and see what the heavens have to offer. Then check out the computer to see what NASA has to offer the student.NASA Moon GlobeLeave this on table top or desk for frequent checks!!
1,Great Looking but totally inaccurate,"This globe is beautiful, but when I opened the package I noticed that it was two northern hemispheres glued together. Its almost like the manufacturer paid a chimp to grab two random pieces and glue them together any which way. Its a shame too because the globe is really detailed and looks great. When I called the shipper, I got the feeling that this is an extremely common problem."
5,Excellent cd!!,"I bought this cd for the song Scandalous and ended up loving the whole cd. The beats and rhythms and awesome!! Yes, there will be the comparisons to many of the other r&b girl groups out there, and that is unavoidable. The music that backs these girls voices is stuff that will make you want to dance. The production is cutting-edge and the beats are very current. In my opinion, this is one of the best r&b club dance cds to come along in years. This cd is a must-have. Ignore the reviews that said Scandalous is the only good track on the cd. There are many good tracks. One Night Stand is a solid dance cut and very catchy. It should be the next single. There are many cuts on the cd that would make good singles for radio play. If you like to dance then you will love this cd."
4,Good Dance Music,"This is a CD for you if you enjoy good beats and hot dance tracks. They do not compare to Destiny's Child, TLC or even 3LW in my eyes, but they still do make room in my CD player like other good CD's do. If you like ""Scandalous"" which is still a hot song after 2 months, you'll like the rest of the album hopefully. Other good dance tracks are ""How Does It Feel"" and ""One Night Stand."" Buy this."
2,Not So Scandalous,"Mis-Teeq is known in America as the U.K. version of TLC, which is a rightful title. Sadly, even though they are somewhat similar, this album isn't as great as a TLC record would be. I'm not trying to compare it to TLC, I just think that even if TLC hadn't existed I still wouldn't enjoy this album.The song starts off as one of the most fun songs of the summer Scandalous, which is a really fun song, but unfortunately the record kinda falls flat afterwards. All of the songs sound generic, which is sad because I can tell these women are capable of so much better. Like ""B With Me"" and ""How Does It Feel"" HEAVILY borrow from each other. It's such a shame.I'm hoping that they don't go away forever because they are capable of so much better as I'm told, and I would love for them to make a sophomore album which would show that."
2,Buy the CD Single of Scandalous instead.,"Scandalous is the sexiest song to come out this year. In my opinion, it's the song of the summer. That one song that comes on that you crank up and jam to. Unfortunatly, there is nothing else on Mis-teeq's debut album that comes even remotely close to it. The girls try to hard to be Destiny's Child, and fail miserably. They don't have the vocal capability or the songs to pull it off. They come of Destiny's Child and TLC wannabes, which is unfortunate because Scandalous is such an amazing song. They certainly have potential, but I was completely bored by this album.Skipping track after track hoping their would be one song that was just as good as Scandalous. Nothing on here is memorable. I suggest buying the CD single before buying this album."
3,A good try,"The debut US cd from Mis-teeq has plenty of upbeat dance songs with hot beats. I love ""One Night Stand"" (their latest single), as well as ""That's Just Not Me"" and ""Roll On""...and of course the catchy ""Scandalous"", which was the theme song to the Cat Woman movie. However, I found that most of the songs sound the same, or had similar lyrics. Though all 3 members have great voices, there weren't a lot of ""stand out"" tracks on here. In my opinion, ""Home Tonight"" is rather boring and slow..not even the guest appearance from Joe helps. Overall, I give this album a C+."
1,Hello?!,"Of course, no one knows these one-hit wonders anymore. In a few years, you'll see this at your 99 cent store."
1,What! This is not the first gold controler!,"I got a Nintendo64 when they first came out. Unlike this gold N64 this is not the true gold controler. When Nintendo lauched N64 in a few of them was the orginal gold controler. This ""new"" gold controler is cheap and the paint comes of easily. I would not recommend this to anyone except if it is your first N64. If you are looking for the true gold controler, good luck because they are rare, or you can call me at 203-629-9381."
3,DA GOLD COMES OFF,LOOK I DONT WANT TO B BAD OR NE THING BU THE GOLD WILL COME OFF IF SWEAT GETS ON IT AND U WON'T BE ABLE 2 CLEAN IT UP IT WILL TURN BLACK THATS IT U SHOULDN T BUY THIS
4,Brass Knux,"I thought it would've been a bigger pendant on a longer chain, but i've grown to LOVE IT!!!!"
2,ring theory,i want to read the answer of this book if i can take it please send to me to my email and help me
1,This workout was agonizingly dull.,"Being a veteran at home workout enthusiast, this work out was BORING. I found it poorly produced, non-motivating and not helpful at all. I love my NEEDAK Rebounder, but this DVD was not a compliment to it. I wouldn't recommend this poorly done DVD to anyone."
4,for a beg,for a beginer I thought it was good. I got a little bored with the repitions but realize that in order to make neuralogical connection you have to do the repitioons
5,A joy to read,"Dale Cramer is a master storyteller--one of the best in the CBA (and the ABA for that matter). I usually gravitate toward the thriller/suspense/horror genre but I'll read anything by Dale Cramer. Levi's Will was a pure joy to read, simply because of Cramer's quality writing. Highly recommend it. A must read."
4,Heartwarming,Wonderful story line. Slow in parts. Conclusion was phenominal. Glad I stuck with it. The truth of this story crept into me and left me in tears. Good story for men. Waiting in great anticipation of Mr. Cramer's next endeavor. Keep them coming.
5,Beautiful!,It was one of those book which kept popping back into my mind days after I read it. A beautiful tale about going back home to find peace and forgiveness.
3,AMISH FICTION,THIS BOOK WAS A DIFFERENT READ THAN I LIKE. IT SKIPPED BACK AND FORTH AND WHEN YOU HAD TO PUT IT DOWN FOR A FEW DAYS IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO PICK IT UP AND CONTINUE. I DID FINISH IT BUT IT WASN'T AS EXCITING.
5,"Hit the trails ""smoking""","this is quite an adventure for someone who has only hike locally in the Cascade Mountains. It is a great way to relax at the end of the day, after sitting at my desk in downtown Seattle all day. I even find my mind wandering-pretending that I am with Smoke on his advenures. Do yourself a favor and take a hike---with Smoke!"
2,Does the job - sticker is a massive PITA,"Thermos is good quality, works as you expect and is a convenient capacity - a bit more than 2 cups. No issues with quality or performance.Call me picky, but when the product is shown as a plain stainless steel container on pictures, but comes with a huge promotional sticker, that's deceptive. Especially when that @#$%^ decal is darn near impossible to remove. I was eventually able to get it off after soaking it for 24 hours in hot water and scrubbing with acetone, but the metal underneath is permanently discolored.CMON GUYS - don't pull that crap. I buy a new product and I expect it to look new. I was mildly ticked off at the amount of work needed to get the darn sticker off, but to find the metal underneath permanently discolored is unacceptable. Buyer beware."
2,"Great thermos, terrible sticker","Great leak-proof thermos for on-the-go hot coffee. No complaints there. But a big complaint about the large promo sticker glued to the side. I spent an hour soaking it, using De-Solv-It, and then gently scraping it off with fingernails... only to discover that the finish underneath had darkened under the hardened layer of glue. Call me vain, but I'd like the thermos to look new for at least its first few months of use.My thermos may have been an unlucky onesy from a back shelf somewhere, I suppose. Whatever, I returned it for the Thermos 'Nissan' bottle (16 oz.), which is virtually identical but arrived with a clean finish--and no darned sticker. (Update, almost 10 months later... I've taken my 'Nissan' to work daily, and it's been a champ. Hot-to-warm coffee all day, no leaks, easy cleaning.)"
5,great themos,"Coffee still hot after 4 hours, but thermos itself is not hot to the touch. it doesnt have a fancy pouring mechanism but it works fine."
5,it's great and works like you want it to...,go this as a gift for the gf and she loves it. says the coffee stays warm well into the afternoon. all the parts seem well made and work as they should.
2,Does not work!,"The first time I tried this, I put in really hot tea and drank it about 5 hours later. By then it had already gotten cool. So I further tested this product by putting in really hot water (steaming) and waiting. In as little as 4 hours, the water had already turned luke warm. This is definitely not designed for drinking coffee/tea hours after you make it. You have to drink it probably within a couple hours of making it. And if you have to do that, what's the point of a thermos?"
4,Worthwhile add to your NT library,"Conservative scholarship, solid history, combined with readability - this volume offers a careful (but layman-friendly) analysis of most of the stories Jesus told. He begins most of the short chapters with a closer look at the setting of the parable. This historical and cultural background sheds first century light on each parable for our twenty-first century eyes. Commentary and application round out each chapter. He addresses various viewpoints and interpretations thoughtfully, but without losing us in arcane academics. His focus is on helping pastors, teachers and writers dig into the text in order to discover the riches there.Kistemacher's scholarship was a great help to me as I wrote my book (Parablelife: Living the stories Jesus told in real time - FaithWalk Publishers - available on amazon.com). And I believe it'll be a great help to you if you're a pastor, Bible study leader or serious student of the Word."
3,OK at best,The book is slightly below adequate for the type of resource I wanted. The insights in it aren't much more thorough than a good study bible. I wanted something deeper and found it it another book that made this one look bad by comparison.I also thought some of the parables were misinterpreted or missed the actual point of the parable but that's a little subjective for this type of review.
4,Cool 80's New Wave,"I was only 4 months old when the movie was set and I haven't seen it yet, but as a big fan of early new wave (especially Blondie, whose No Exit track with Coolio was just awesome)I'll recommend this CD. It's worth it just for Just What I Needed by the Cars, but then there's also that Candy song which is fun and anything by the Go-Gos is cool by me. Oh yeah, and i was happily surprised to hear ""Ladies Night"" in all its campy disco glory."
3,"The item was good, the delivery was horrible","I ordered this on May 20, 2010 and was waiting very long for this product.After two weeks I emailed the seller and was told that there was no tracking number or anything.Finally, I got my product a day short of ONE month from the date I ordered and paid.All I have to say is, customers should of been notified that there was going to be no tracking device and that it takes them a whole month to ship out."
3,Why I didn't buy it (or why I would have)...,"I have sooo many 80's songs (and love them all), that I didn't need another compilation, except there was a brief scene in the movie where two eastern men are riffing on the surf song ""Riptide"" on sitars... I loved that and would have bought this disc if it had been included. However, if you're looking for a decent 80s mix, this is a good place to start."
4,what are the missing songs from the movie?,i love the soundtrack but im trying to find out a song in the movie that is not on the soundtrack CD ..its that one song in the scene where Ben Affleck gets the Drinks for the 2 girl friends he's on a date with them and the song is playing from the jukebox and its a lady singing but I cant figure out who it is and what the song is..Please write back if you know the Artist or Title..Thanks a lot!
4,Structured Play,"While Cat N Mouse fits very well into the ECM chamber-jazz niche, there is occasional dynamism, especially from Baron and Johnson, enough to pique the interest of the casual listener. Overall, the aim seems to be to keep things quiet in order to explore the subtle interplay among Feldman, Johnson, and Abercrombie. Meanwhile, Baron is very adept at making tasteful contributions to the mix. I especially like his inventive & swinging cymbal and brush work on the opening cut. There is enough of both ""free"" and ""structured"" play to satisfy the fan of both, but ECM is ECM, and if you're not a fan of the label's particular brand of jazz, this one probably isn't for you."
4,rainy night music,"john abercrombie and company unveil a subtle and exciting musical journey on this 2002 disc. the mood is established on the opening track ""A Nice Idea"" and evolves quickly into the outstanding ""Convolution."" mark feldman's violin floats in and around john's starry-eyed guitar passages and the rhythm section provides splashes of dark blue colours, allowing plenty of room for joey baron's expressive drumming. there are a few glorious moments of free musical release; but overall things are kept at a very controlled pace. overall, there seems to be an atmosphere of darkness incorporated with the music on this disc, but plenty of lighter notes escape from the corners and create a whimsical feeling that keeps you listening again and again. packaged nicely (as most ECM releases are) with lots of black and white photos of the performing musicians."
4,Teased from Its Hole,"Veteran guitarist John Abercrombie has played with a variety of musicians in a variety of musical settings, both as a sideman and as a leader. On this new ECM outing, he is joined by Mark Feldman on violin, Marc Johnson on bass, and Joey Baron on drums. I'm not sure why this CD was titled Cat `n' Mouse, as there is no cut by that name, but I suspect that part of the reason might be that the phrase is descriptive of the way Abercrombie composes music: the melody sometimes has to be teased out of its hole.Most of the music on this session has an introspective character, convoluted and intertwined. Abercrombie and Feldman weave in and out of each others' lines, with Johnson and Baron punctuating the proceedings and adding life and energy to the sound. This is not music that is easy to hum, but is certainly enjoyable to sit and listen to. It will not grab you at first listen, but it will grow on you as you listen to it again, which you will want to do."
3,No problems with cooker,"I have only used it once and had no problem with it. The instruction manual is VERY LACKING though. It was not very clear, for some one that has never used a pressure cooker before. The diagram pictures were very very small and useless for this 71 year old's eyes. I give the cooker itself a 4 out of 5, But the instruction manual only gets a 1 of of 5."
1,Scorches,"I tried two recipes, the first on the I setting, and the second on the II setting. Both scorched in the same exact pattern on the bottom of the cooker, though there was plenty of liquid. I would not recommend this product."
1,Burns to easily,I have had the cooker for a few weeks. I tried 2 different recipes (with plenty of water) and both burnt the bottom of the pan. I sent the unit back without cleaning it to show them the results. Maybe I had a faulty unit but until I see better results I cannot recommend this unit.
4,Good source for rubber stamping ideas,"This is one of the better rubber stamping books. If you are interested in a book on making greeting cards using rubber stamping, I highly recommend it."
3,Good not Great,"I am just getting started in the hobby of stamping and card making. This book was nice, but I have seen better. Maybe once I start doing more and become an avid card maker/stamper, I will appreciate this one more."
5,no blisters with these socks,"My little boy wears rigid orthotics and used to get a lot of hot spots and blisters while running. We've found and use some blister-proof wool socks, but these are the only cotton socks we've found that stands up to the claim of offering blister protection. He loves these socks so much that we bought several sets. Though they're typical Thorlo-thick, he wears them year round (unless he's wearing snow boots)."
5,Fun with a unique twist,"Someone who doesn't like pop music, but loves original style and/or the french language will get a kick out of this. I like every one of these songs. I don't know how she does it, but it works for me."
3,Music cd by april march,"This cd was not anything like the other 2 that i purchased, nothing wrong with it, just a different style! It's ok and i will get used to it! Thankyou for being the only people that could supply me!"
2,So-so,"An interesting album. Clearly the band is accomplished, April March herself has an endearing, sexy voice. With the exception of ""Pas Pareil"", however, the album didn't draw me in -- they just seemed like throwaway mood pieces from 1963. Perhaps that was the point, but it wasn't what I was looking for.Pas Pareil, by contrast, is a beautiful, witty piece of music."
2,WELL......,"this cd isnt all what I would want it to be but, there is one song from a video I like that really reminds me of europe, which i like a lot.-Tom Penny"
3,Solid Intro,This is a good introduction to the topic. It's basically a survey and exposition on the early entry of fractal concepts into the realm of more mainline mathematics/physics.
3,Touch - 'Street Suite' (Gear Fab) 3 1/2 stars,"First off,I cannot believe that no one has ever reviewed this CD here,before me.Touch was an extremely short-lived psych band that was based in,above all places - St.Louis,Missouri.'Street Suite' was their sole album.Nice CD reissue.Total of fifteen tracks with some of them having a rather blues or even a folk vibe to 'em.Cuts I liked the best were ""Round Trip"",cover of the Door's ""Light My Fire"",""Gotta Keep Travellin' On"" and the somewhat bluesy ""Catfish"".Line-up:Paulette Butts-vocals,Eric Salas&Ray Schulte-guitars,Jerry Schulte-bass and Ovid Bilderbeck-drums.Should appeal to some fans of,say Jefferson Airplane(especially,with the female vocals),Blue Cheer,Flash,Youngbloods,Quicksilver Messenger Service and maybe even the Electric Prunes.A long-lost forgotten record that's well worth checking out.See for yourself."
1,DO NOT BUY AT ANY PRICE----SAVE YOURSLEF,"I purchased this model 3yrs ago for Xmas 2004 when it was the latest technoloy.My 1st unit stopped working after 2 months and only after a significant amount of aggrivation with customer support it was replaced under warrantee by viewsonic BUT ONLY with a rebuilt unit and I had to ship mine back to them in California first (good thing I had the box). Now that it is almost 3yrs old it will not turn on at all and the high voltage board is burnt out & not worth fixing. A product like this should last well beyond 3yrs. I certainly feel cheated and victimized. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM AT ANY PRICE. If I could I would rate this one negative 100.It also goes without saying that this model is now obsolete and there are much more advanced lcd hdtv out there w/ better resolution, better contrast and HDMI connectivity."
1,Appearances Can Be Deceiving,"The ""PC Connectivity"" of this monitor is a joke. I wanted to get an immediate refund. Windows XP is NOT compatible with this sleek hi tech monster. All I could eventually get was HUGE type that was still blurry. BUY A TV MONITOR, NOT THIS MESS.It would make a nice TV as it is portable and seems to pick up vibrant and bright color. Frankly, the Sharp Aquos series is far better--it's a really beautiful set and picture. It does NOT claim any PC ability. At least Sharp is honest."
5,Not bad at all!,"I don't get all of the negative reviews. This is a good horror movie. The acting is really good, the snowbeast scared the crap out of me, and the whole movie is just done well. No, this is not as good as Hammer Film's The Abominable Snowman, but it still is a good Yeti flick. Check it out, if you like Yeti movies, I think you will like this."
4,snowbeast,"In response to John Page and his review, I could not agree more. This brought back many fond memories of my younger days and how t.v. used to be. And by the way, I purchased the complete night stalker series on ebay. Kolchak rules lol"
3,not a bad flick,"I saw this movie on tv back a few years after it came out when I was around 16 years old. I enjoyed it and recently purchased it again. It has its duller moments with the conversations and small talk in between scenes of the creatures actions. The creatures face isnt visable much but I never had a problem with that anyway. The scenery is beautiful and this was one smart creature knowing how to trash a camper (what bad luck they had) with a pile of logs. anyway, for the price its a cool flick I liked it."
2,"""Bigfoot"" in the woods B-movie","this is a typical low budget monster in the woods movie. Much of it is filmed in POV style (point of view), meaning you see what the monster sees, but you don't see the monster itself (except for a few seconds here and there).A Colorado ski resort is in the middle of winterfest. But all is not well. Skiers have been found brutally killed out on the ski runs, and torn apart by what appears to be a wild animal, (or something else).While some people wish to warn the publc and cancel the winterfest, there are others with a financial stake who wish to continue the celebration non matter what the risk to the public."
1,BAD SNOWBEAST DVD,"The product was purchased a long ways back, and I truly disapproveof this specific dvd of Snowbeast. It has bad quality on the vergeof terrible along with horrible sound quality. This dvd's Audio/Soundwas so dissappointing that I asked my son to purchase me a Blu Ray playerand a surround sound system for better audio/video, but to my dimise thisdidn't help, so I purchased Snowbeast somewhere else."
1,bristles don't hold up,"I really liked this brush at first, and so did my 3 cats. But the bristles sink into the brushhead and you have to pull them back out. This has gotten worse in the month or so since I've had the brush, and it's really annoying. You literally must pull each bristle back out in order to use the item. I finally just threw it out."
1,If you like good writing . . .,Then find another book. Mr. Knelman seems incapable of painting his prose anything but purple. I couldn't get past the first chapter. There's a good book about Mr. Carrey waiting to be written; but this isn't it.
4,Soaring Crane Qigong-The Five Routines,"I am a certified Soaring Crane Qigong instructor and have seen this material presented in various forms. This video is the best version of this material that I have seen. The Five Routines are amply demonstrated by Master Zhao, the creator of this incredible practice. The scenery, music and Maureen's narration certainly support the presentation of this extremely valuable information. I would, however, strongly suggest that this video be used in conjunction with private or class instruction for best results. Benefit gained from this comprehensive qi gong practice is directly related to the frequency & accuracy of practice."
2,Not what i expected !,"I was very desappointed by this product. From the DVD picture showned on line, i assumed the show was taped in color and of much better quality than it actually was. Sure it was nice to see Johnny Cash performed as a young man but overall this DVD was overpriced and of poor quality."
3,Your basic introductory book,"This book was one of the books used for a computing class I recently took. It is very easy to use and follow along. The tutorials are quite literally step-by-step. This, unfortunately, is it's one weakness: not going into details or really the concepts behind WHY this works or that functions that way. This is just a ""here is what you click"" manual."
3,3.5 Stars?...why not?,"A live recording from 2000 - Berlin + Tampere. Just found this cd used and I am mixed. It's not bad, some fine moments, but nothing really special. So...I keep going back and forth...do I need to keep this one, probably not. ...But I am not sure. -james wood"
4,So far so good....,"I received this product today, and popped it into my PC. So far it works extremely well. Upgrading from the Celeron D, this P4 unlocked some previously unavailable options in my OS."
5,Earth history,I have an older edition from my time at Ohio State about 15 years ago and much has changed. I love the newer edition with more precambrian history and evolutionary history of major fauna groups. The book is heavily illustrated which is a big plus. I like the bibliography and have used those sources to order books to get a different perspective. Great undergraduate book.
2,"Hold the Tenth Edition, Time for Some Errata","It is about time that Dr. Levin stop churning out new editions to kill off the used book market and pay some attention to the quality of his text. The book is full of typos that could easily have been caught by a spelling checker. But even worse there are some glaring mistakes. For example, Figure 17-6C on page 543 has a photograph labeled ""Capuchin"" (a new world monkey). Figure 17-7C on page 544 has the identical photograph labeled ""Langur"" (an old world monkey). OK, which is which. The pedagogical value of the illustration is lost and so is the confidence in the rest of the text. This is an embarrassment.In these hard times, I appreciate the need to keep the cash flowing. But let's do this with some integrity."
5,Excellent tape covering the basic concepts of soccer.,A great video that covers the basics of soccer. It is valuable for first timers as well as a good review for those involved with the game for sometime. Hamm and her cohort really give an excellent conceptual basis of soccer tactics as well as excellent demonstrations.
3,Runs very Small,"I bought these in a size 10 because in sandals I usually have to get a larger size due to how small they run. Well these run even smaller. They would actually fit someone who wears a size 8, which I wound up giving them to my daughter. She loves them, but just be forewarned they run very small."
1,Yipes....pinched my piggies!,I had to donate this particular pair of flip flops after only wearing them for a couple of weeks because they'd pinched my toes and were quite uncomfortable. Go for the Nike Comfort Thongs (for men and women). They are the best sandal out there! I wear them to work almost every day. You won't be disappointed in that particular model.
3,cute but wobbly,These are very cute sandals and I really wish they had fit me. I usually wear size 8.5 but I ordered 9 to be on the safe side and they were too short and too narrow. I have a pretty normal/narrow foot but in these sandals my foot would actually go over the side edges of the sandal unless I walked very carefully. I think that's what made them feel wobbly. I returned them - but sadly - they were very cute!
5,Toward a Meaningful Life..great book,This book is like reading Proverbs. So much wisdom about living life. So concise and interesting.I put it on my must read list.
5,This is great,I really enjoyed the book. It is a good mix of deep philosophy combined with very practical and real world application and insights. It is a huge task to tackle the Rebbe's Wisdom but the author did a great job all around.
1,hagiography. One learns nothing real about the man,"This is an hagiography, written by insider and aiming to praise not to explain the man"
4,Small but functional,"I put this little table between a side chair and our couch. It fits well for the small space and can hold a small lamp - and I've even put a small set of coasters on it too. Getting my drift... it's small - but functional! It's enough for each person to set their drinks on. Just a note, it looks like the glass is smoke color in the picture - which I would have liked, but alas, it is just clear glass on top. Make sure you measure as this table is pretty short."
4,Bama Wheel Cover,"Excellent product, but did not fit my 2004 tacoma but I put it on my 1999 4 runner.Received it in a timely manner and was also FREE SHIPPING THANKS TO AMAZON."
5,Great gift for my father,I got this for my father for his birthday. Fits his 2000-generation Jeep Grand Cherokee wheel nicely. Feels pretty nice on the steering wheel.
4,great,Got this to replace the home alarm battery. Was the exact same thing and worked great. Good price too. Easy to hook up by a regular homeowner.
4,Yuasa NP4-12 battery,I needed a replacement battery for my alarm system. This one is an exact match and the previous one lasted 14 years. I connected it to my system the trouble light cleared and I haven't had a bit of trouble since.
4,almost perfect,"This an old time classic of a film, captivating from beginning to end. One of the best adventure films made. I returned it after learning it is in a 2.35 aspect ratio.I still don't get why these are not made for 16x9 wide screen TV's. So people be aware, ""enhanced for wide screen TVs"" does not mean you get to watch a full picture on your wide screen TVs. I'm still watching my laser disk version and won't give it up untill a ""made for 16x9 TVs"" version comes out in a 1.78 aspect ratio."
5,The Ultimate Adventure Film Ever,"The way he grins, talks, walks, cracks the whip, and overall knows he's the best, Indiana Jones is one of the greatest action heroes that ever lived. This is the best of the series, obviously, and the plot is so imaginative. An American fighting Nazis while trying to save the most amazing artifact in history AND get the woman he lost, who could do it? Indiana Jones.You know Tom Sellek was first offered the role?"
5,A wonderful entertaining film!,Steven Spielberg at one of his finest moments of his early career. A great ride through one of the adventures of a larger than life archeologist name Indiana. Cinematically speaking this movie follows the standard tricks and slights of hand. However the director does so much better than alot of the other directors out there. Through every frame of this movie Spielberg takes us on a roller coaster ride of an adventurous Prof. Jones. One film to be enjoyed by generations to come. Very entertaining! Highly recommended!
5,BEST EVER,"This is without a doubt, the best movie I have ever seen. I recomend it to the old, young, even the stupid. It's just such a great movie. Action is something that makes it interesting, but doesn't take over the movie, it still has a great plot, and the acting is very well done. Thumbs up to Harrison Ford and Denholm Elliot."
3,A lot of holes in retrospect,"I watched the movie with my 10 year old son recently. Yes, it's a fine, action packed movie, but in 25 years it's definitely dated. Although an action-fantasy, there are an alarming number of non-sequiturs in the movie regarding the reason/logic of events. Cultural stereotypes are also an issue. The violence is also ""ramboesque"" in places. The humor somewhat masks these issues, but they're clearly apparent. Raiders is more a homage and testament to the art of the hollywood blockbuster, and I'm not sure where that ranks in the realms of true art as compared to the halls of titillation. Food for thought."
2,I don't know.,"I've watched this film about 4 times. I don't really know what it's about. I should go out, buy a copy, and watch it about 10 more times.The story starts off with a expedition into a jungle in search of an old relic. It ends with a finding of a greater one. In between there's a blur.I think I'm going to buy it. That's all."
1,I dont want cinema to be like that...,"that all i have to say... this is film dont worth more of my attention, I hate it! I would like it if i thought killing is verry fun, but if you americans love this kind of films enjoy yourself, this is not the kind of cinema that I want..."
5,Best movie with a ruined title,"I've been waiting for years for a widescreen version of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" It is still one of the greatest films of all time, and even by today's standards they don't make 'em like this anymore.But I refuse to buy this movie until they fix the damage they've done to the title. ""INDIANA JONES AND THE Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is not the movie I saw."
1,The Money Maker strikes again,"Like my predecessor in his review,i just have to say that George Lucas always mess around with DVDs,Special Edition,Exclusive Special Edition,Original Cut,and Limited Editions.One thing is clear his Cash Cow Indy Jones will always work on Dvd but this Editions are for nothing.The original release is awesome the Specials ok,so why put them away and buy another disc.It's a shame that real fans will consider to buy the new editions,but they shall be warned,it's a waste of money."
5,Indiana Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark,"Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (Special Edition)As a ""Baby Boomer"", I really appreciate great movies. This is my favorite. I searched numerous outlets without luck and finally found this title on DVD available at Amazon.com. I am a ""Classic movie buff"" and have recently made attempts to upgrade my collection of movies from VCR to DVD format. The video quality and remastered sounds help to defray the bite of the cost of replacement. I'm a Cary Grant fan but Harrison Ford is also great. The remastered versions of the ""classics"" are well worth the effort and expense. Don't give up your search for your favorites. It is well worth the effort and cost."
5,One of my favorite movies.,I finally broke down and purchased this to have in my library. A great story and great acting. A classic.
5,Adventure.,Arrive in good order and one time. This is one of my husband's favorite movies. He asked me to get it for him for Christmas. I know he'll like it.
5,Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (Special Edition),"The year is 1936. A professor who studies archeology named Indiana Jones is venturing in the jungles in South America searching for a golden statue. Unfortunately, he sets off a deadly trap doing so, miraculously, he escapes. Then, Jones hears from a museum curator named Marcus Brody about a biblical artifact called The Ark of the Covenant, which can hold the key to humanly existence. Jones has to venture to vast places such as Nepal and Egypt to find this artifact. However, he will have to fight his enemy Renee Belloq and a band of Nazis in order to reach it. If you like movies, then Raiders is a movie that will not let you down. Raiders of the Lost Ark is pure entertainment,and that is what makes it the classic that it is."
4,Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark,Indiana Jones and the raiders of the Lost Ark:I really liked the movie and special effects and action. It's a entertaining flick.
5,Probably the best adventure film ever made.,You have Harrison Ford who is simply marvelous as the charismatic Indiana Jones. Add to that a plot that simply never stops moving - put in a dash of the metaphysical - and you have one hell of a film.The mix of real history with the supernatural themes work so well in this movie that you can't help but believe it's all true. The scenery and the soundtrack by John williams (the best movie soundmaker ever) all envelope you into this incredible movie. If you love action/adventure - this is your movie. Look no further.Where is the DVD?
4,Funny and entertaining action/adventure movie...,"I'll start out by saying that I am not a huge fan of action/adventure movies. Still, once in a while I like to watch a good one, and Raiders of the Lost Ark certainly fits that qualification! It is a real roller-coaster ride in the Spielburg style - it is essentially one cliffhanger after another (in this case there are some literal cliffhangers as well).The plot is pretty ridiculous, but that is besides the point. Raiders of the Lost Ark keeps you having fun for the whole time. Besides being exciting, it is pretty humorous as Spielburg clearly does not take himself too seriously. With this movie, he brings back the old style of the B-picture, and has fun doing it. The acting is good - Harrison Ford and Karen Allen are perfect as the tough guy archeologist and his spunky girlfriend. Anyhow, this is a fun movie to watch. If you are bored, just grab this movie and some popcorn and enjoy."
5,good product,I purchased this a couple years ago because my granddaughter had never seen it but mostly because she was in band and they were doing the music from Raiders of the Lost Arc. She found it helpful.
5,The Greatest Film Ever Made.,"This is probably the best film ever made. Ever.It is as close as anyone has ever come to making a perfect film.The Cast, the acting, the directing,the cinematography, the score....EVERYTHING in Raiders is worth watching over and over again!"
5,Beautiful Piece,"Item was even more beautiful than the picture. It arrived with no shipping damage, and we put it together in less than a couple of minutes. Very easy to install, it does not come with mounting screws so you will need to get your own. Overall very pleased with it."
4,Worked great for Christmas caramels.,"I bought these papers just for the homemade caramels I make at Christmas time. Last year I used regular waxed paper, which I cut myself. It worked alright, but cutting the pieces of paper and trying to keep the size uniform was very time consuming. This year's job was made much easier using the pre-cut pieces. I would never cut my own again. Since I give these away at Christmas as gifts, I don't feel the added expense of pre-cut wrappers is an unreasonable expense."
4,"Worked well, convenient","This twisting wax paper worked as advertised - wrapped nicely around my caramels, and didn't untwist even when I threw them haphazardly into a bag. In terms of function, I'd give them 5 stars.However, I'm only giving them 4 because the price is a little silly - for the same price, I can buy a roll of parchment paper or waxed and cut squares myself; a single $6 roll of parchment paper would yield three to five times as many squares. Still, the pre-cut pieces are super convenient, so I'll probably buy them again."
4,nice product,made the candy wrapping much easier than cutting my own papers.they did tear fairly easily when twisting but held the closure. Overall pleased and will purchase again.
3,Must be the seller.....not the product!,I bought this hammer for my husband for work. We were disappointed with the look of the hammer when we rec'd it...it looked as if it had been used...the handle was all dirty with scuff marks. It truly looked as if someone with greasy hands had been using the hammer or throwing it around. If it weren't for the sealed label on the head of the hammer...i would have returned it. The delivery was made to my job and even my co-workers commented on how it looked.
3,Canada Chinese,"The Fuller company is part of Johnson Level in Canada but the hammers are stamped MADE IN CHINA. They look nice, the handles are a little long for a mechanics liking but for the cost they should not be imports."
3,It looks nice but not durable,It came apart while putting it on in one spot =/ The cover still looks good! Worth the money paid.
4,"CD was perfect, the CD-book in the CD case (in front) was missing","The CD got to me (in the Netherlands) really quickly, and when it came it was perfectly wrapped. Furthermore the CD was in excellent condition. However, the book that usually is in the CD-case was missing, and they did not say this in the advert. But I don't mind really, because it was the music I was interested in..."
4,A good choice for friends who enjoy birding,I chose this book because it is a great choice for those who enjoy birds in their yard. Gives another dimension for enjoyment.
3,Smaller than you think,The Adesso Zurich Mag Rack comes in 2 pieces - easy to put together. I was disapointed that it is smaller that I was expecting and can't hold larger magazines of tabloid size. Looks more like a walnut finish to actual walnut wood!
5,Good material,I don't want to have a cheep material stuff at my home but it has to be reasonable price. This is solid wood and duarable. I can put my laptop as well as magazines. it is fashionable but not too loud. you can trust this product. I really like it.
3,Nice product if you maintain weight,It's excellent if you maintain the amount of magazines you store. Too many for too long and the wood will definitely split.
2,How much more of this can we take?,"Let's get one thing straight: I am hardcore, over-the-edge, totally obsessed Pikachu-loving Pokemaniac. And *I* didn't like this. With cold, steel-edged graphics that don't at all meet up to the standard of the original, this game is just so...BAD! Sure, the addition of the newest Pokemon is great, and I loved Earl's Library, but why bother putting it in this weird new format? Here's a hint: take the original Pokemon Stadium. Add new features. That would've been good enough! But here, Nintendo has gone overboard with souping up a children's game! You can only take this concept so far!"
3,A bit disappointing...,"I rented this game and found it to be very disappointing. It was, however, very useful and fun in some areas including Earl's PKM Academy and the games. Unfortunately, the graphics on the new pokemon weren't very... good. I was very disappointed when I found that the gallery was removed. That is my favourite feature in PS1, and I really missed it in PS2. My advice is not to buy this game, but to rent it if and when you feel like playing it."
5,"the cute,the fun,and the unusual","This is such a great game.With the full line of new and old poke'mon you can buy an old game and have new adventures.With mini games to chose from you'll never feel bored!!You can also battle your friends and win trophies.It also includes earl's pok'e mon academy where you can learn to battle effectively.With a full line of cute,fun,and unusual poke'mon this is the ultimate game for poke'mon lovers."
3,Videogamefan's Pokemon Stadium 2 Review,"The game is good if you wanna play Pokemon gold/silver on the tv and the battles are ok, but they get very repetitive."
1,never received,"We never received this item and when I contacted the seller via e-mail they got awful smart with me, so I WILL NEVER BUY FROM THEM AGAIN NOR WILL I RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE I KNOW EITHER."
1,you'd have more fun serving food to the elderly,"...Instead of getting the game, why don't you get your pets to beat up each other? Same thing! Except the pokemon look like villians from power rangers. You know... big weird multi colered plastic armor, purple skin, the works. The moves are like: sand smack, bubble gun, breathe, smack, hit, injure, maim, scratch, scream, and run away. Some idiot commentator says the same thing over and over. So in conclusion, micowave applesauce and see what happens. It is more entertaining."
1,Another Bad Game,This game is the worst! Even more Horrible than the first. For first time gamers I Wouldn't recommend this.
4,249 pokemon,"I have not gotten it yet, but i will. The one thing that really bothers me is: what are the two missing pokemon? it is not selebi, but other than that the game looks great"
3,This is a good game,I recomend this game only if you dont have pokemon stadium one or if you are a pokemon fan or else you'll be in for a big disapointment. Youve been warned!!
5,Pokemon stadium 2 is an excellent game for kids!!!!,"Readers, if your friends tell you that pokemon stadium 2 stinks don't listen to them. This game is an excellent game for kids. You should buy this game. This game is about pokemon battling other trainers at classes, gyms, parks, and yes, stadiums. It also have mini-games like EAGER EEVEE and EGG EMERGENCY, And also my other favorits I won't tell you, you have to find out your self if you do it you will have so much fun!"
3,For the Price,"I have three Black, Silver, & Gold and all stayed closed. The Screen Protector was missing on one but only needed one. Still have the one from another case. have to pop it out the case to fit in the docking station and the belt clip was a joke. I ended up going to the dollar store and getting a belt clip and some super glue to replace the belt clip on the back of the case for all three. So with shipping maybe $16 each. Still cheaper that the rubber case that I never use."
2,Vile product,"Okay I ran out of my usual protien powder so I thought I would try another supplement and I grabbed this. Really how bad can you make chocolate powdered drink mix, really bad. The smell is sickly sweet slightly chemical, the taste is vile just plain vile. Way to sweet if this is chocolate then it it came from a a better living through chemistry gone wrong. Also it makes sludge even when well blended. It is this thick not quite shake like dare I say liquid. While the product may have benefits in its formulation that make it good for someone training and working out, if you cannot consume it then it does you no good though."
2,gross,"This powder tastes absolutely VILE. I got it because I was on a low carb diet and someone had recommended it, but I don't know what they were thinking. I drink my protein right after workouts at the gym, so I don't have the luxury of hiding it's taste with milk, fruit and ice. I mix it straight with water and it's disgusting. There are several other brands that have low carb powders which taste great when mixed with water."
2,Horribly Disgusting But Super Healthy,"This is the worst tasting protein shake I've ever had. Ever. I've tried at least six different varieties. I don't know who these people are that have the time after their workout to make a nice fruit and protein cocktail from their protein shake, but I'm not one of them. I tried having this shake once with bites of fresh fruit, and it was still barely edible. It's low fat, packs a ton of protein, calories are almost all from protein, it's low sugar, and all that. But, I still want something that's going into my body to taste good, and this doesn't fit the bill at all. I'm going back to Monster Mass or Muscle Milk."
4,Makes a great smoothie,"I put two scoops of chocolate, 1 instant breakfast no sugar added, 12 frozen strawberries, 1 frozen bannana, light soy milk and almond milk. This makes 3 16 oz shakes so 93 calories from powder, 40 calories from milk and about 100 calories from fruit so for under 250 calories I have a high protien, low glycemic index smoothie that gets me through a few hours as I am trying to eat 6 smalll meals a day! Try it, this is very good"
1,Why is 3D Globe so good?,"3D Globe doesn't seem to DO anything much. Click on a city name and it does nothing. Click on ANYTHING and it does nothing. It doesn't even zoom closer than a standard state highway map. So the globe rotates and shows night and day... and you can look up cities and countries. You can do that with an encyclopedia. By comparison, Encarta is a thrill ride IMHO.To me this software performs like something from the $1.00 CD clearance rack."
3,So - So,"I bought this software because I teach a class on Geography. National Geographic is well known for producing excellent maps, however with this product I was a bit disappointed. The drawbacks are many, and include not being able to zoom in very far to observe details, regions within countries are not named, nor is there a display option to show them, political maps do not show state, or any other internal political boundaries within countries. Overall, it has some good uses, but I find myself still accessing google earth more often than this software."
3,pendant,"Product was nice but looked a lot better in the picture it looked ""cheap"" once i got it in my hand, but my wife liked it."
4,pretty,"I bought this for myself initially. Then, I bought a necklace for my mother as a mother's day gift and it didn't have enough charms on it, so I added this to it. It was a nice addition. This product once recieved is nice, but I didn't like the chain it was on.This is definitely perfect as a charm for something else!"
4,"Not bad for the price, but not great either","Considering such a low price, this is nice, but even though inexpensive materials were used, I would have like to see a better attempt to make something that seems to be quality made. The reverse side (which often get turned forward, due to shape of charm) is hollow, and shows very rough construction. It is obvious that the reverse side is intended to remain hidden, but due to low weigh and the shape, it often gets turned around when worn, and it it almost embarrassing, as it makes you wonder how cheap the backside of it looks to everyone else. (This info came from my fiance)."
3,Beautiful Pendent Heart,Such a beautiful pendent disappointed with the chain.There was a small knot in it ? Beside that it wouldhave receive (5) star....
2,Below average,"Small cheap and not very shiny. Made in china. Definitely returning this one, it is of subpar quality. Looks like a necklace from one of those 50 cent machines."
1,poor,"about this item for my girlfriend did not like the quality of the chain the chain was not 18 inches long I would not purchase this item again knowing that the chain-link this fake it's more like eight 12"" to 14"" chain"
4,Beautiful,"This was a gift for my sister. And yes, she is proud of her brother for this. It came in a cheap unsophisticated pouch. Said that, the pendant glistened like it was made up of diamond when we unpacked it. It came with a thin chain as shown in the picture and no, that's not silver as it started turning black within a week of it's use. But about the pendant, it has been more than a month since my sister has been using it. And it still glistens when it catches light. I am happy with that. However, my sister guards it with her life. She removes it when she goes to bath though. So, the pendant has not come in contact with water much. I can't say how water would affect it.All in all, it's a fair deal. Very ideal for a humble gift."
3,cheap chain but good price for the charm,This was a Christmas gift for my son's girlfriend and I love the charm. The chain that came with it was cheap but the price is good for the charm. I ordered another chain and it looks beautiful.
4,Pave Heart Pendant,The Pendant is beautiful - nicer in person than the photo online. It was delivered quickly & well packaged. I am very happy with my purchase.
5,Classic Garner - The Mercury Years,"As the title says, this CD contains the original version of Garner's classic track ""Misty"", plus a good dozen standards done in Garner's unique style, which has been copied so often that it is now ubiquitous. Several great Garner originals on here too... like the hot ""7-11 Jump"". This CD was also remastered, and sounds terrific. If you like Erroll Garner, you'll be sure to like this one."
3,"+1/2 -- Take 1 of Garner's classic ""Misty"" plus more","Recorded in 1954 in Chicago, and originally released under the title of ""Erroll Garner Contrasts"", this disc features a number of one-take recordings. Two tracks from the same session (but different original LP releases) have been added to this CD release: ""Exactly Like You"" and ""Oh, Lady Be Good.""Although perhaps it was simply coincidence, the Chicago location of the recording date shows through in the bluesy edge that many of the tracks have. Most of the performances are a lot more bouncy and upbeat than other Garner recordings I've listened to, yet they retain a relaxed feeling.According to the liner notes this is the very first version of ""Misty"" ever recorded. Apparently Garner composed it in his head while flying to the session. The version heard here is take 1. The featured trio is: Erroll Garner (p), Wyatt Ruther (b) and Eugene Heard (d)."
4,A valuable book for me,"I had checked a number of painting books out of the library and was so impressed with this one that I purchased it. I didn't rate it 5 stars because I could imagine there being a more complete and sophisticated book. However, she appears to be a solid painter and she deals with more than just a couple of color wheels. She also offers up her manner of mixing colors. It's always nice to know how someone else approaches these matters."
5,Color harmony,"I think this book is excellent. It clearly explains which color combinations are pleasing to the eye, how to create depth and how light can affect color. It also gives a demonstration which I always find very helpful. It also shows the Munsell color wheel which I had never seen before. There is information on composition. Lots of very good information. A very good and clearly explained book on color combinations."
2,Save your money,If you expect a thriller out of this book you'll be disappointed. If you expect a great love story you'll be despondent. The heroine make such blunders that you'll laugh... and the hero ditto.
4,Like and love,"This book has a special place as Cherry's first novel and the introduction of the T-flac world and characters. As a debut novel it is great and shows the promise of what this series has become. One of my favorites. I recently purchased the audible addition and enjoyed it immensely. It was fun to go back to the beginning and remember where it all began. If you are a Cherry Fan, this is a must own. If you are new to Cherry, start here and keep reading you won't be sorry."
1,Disappointing,"It was recommended to me because I like the Suzanne Brockmann Troubleshooter books, but it wasn't anything like them at all!"
3,The Mercenary,Not quite sure why the book ended without Tory telling Marc that she was pregnant. Really disappointed with the ending. I also thought this book would be connected to the others in the series. Maybe continuing with her brother and his story thus her telling him and Marc about her pregnancy. I love it when the female tells the unsepecting male that she is going to have his baby and his response to her revelation. Nothing is more exciting than telling a man (especially a mercenary) that he is going to be a father.
3,A littleout there,She writes a great story. But the brother thing seems like a filler in the middle of a great romance.
1,This was horrible,The characters have no charater. The book is jumping all over the place. It was difficult to picture what was actually going on in the book. I think she was trying to hard with the characters role in the book. Either they were to mean and made absolutely no sense or really had a place in the book or they just were useless and she needed to come up with something else to fill the pages.
3,Series shows promise,"OK, I actually started reading this series (T-FLAC) out of order with the 'Edge' books, Edge of Danger, ...Fear, ...Darkness and liked it so well, that I had to go back to the beginning. This first book was not near as good as I was hoping it would be, but sometimes the first in a series is not. Yet you know it has the potential to become an awesome series, which this one has become. I thought the main character, Victoria Jones was a bit of a wimp, she read more like a 'romance novel' female character and Marc was the usual brooding male. This book does fall way short of later books. I don't think you'd necessarily have to read it to understand the series, unless you are like me and have to read them in order! But I agree with another reviewer, if I had read this one first I don't know if I would have continued in the series, I am so glad I read these out of order because this series is great!"
2,Rough,"Alas, a too obvious amateur first offering that simply hints at future writing talent ... at times. Get it at the library as it is certainly not a keeper. The main characters are so inconsistent and undeveloped that you will be shaking your head at their sudden changes in personality and actions."
5,You're insane if you don't buy at least two copies,"This, to put it simply, is the single finest trip-hop DJ set ever cut to CD. It's been in my regular rotation for years...Strictly classy, kickin' beats. No ifs, ands, or maybes. Turntable wizardry of the highest calibre. Dare we call a DJ an artist? If you do, make sure your list includes Krush.Dope."
3,"""Nice"" story but could have been better written.",I did enjoy reading this book but it did not have the intensity and detail that I would have expected. I found myself wanting to just finish it and move on to my next book.
3,half stepping,"I received my camera and the CD software, but I did not receive the USB port, that was suppose to be included with it. I have emailed them twice and I still haven't received it yet. If they would have responded back to me since that last email and told me something. I love the camera and I am enjoying it; but I can't download anything on my computer without the USB port. Other than that, the purchase was good."
3,Has its moments...,"As the leading civilian authority on the U.S. Secret Service, I reluctantly give this partial propaganda a 3-star rating, largely for the GOOD, non-propaganda information contained within. Dorman, a staunch government friend and anti-Garrison advocate, had Secret Service help with this book...which definitely tainted the results in the JFK areas of the book. If you are a Secret Service enthusiast, you have to get it, though; it's that simple."
3,Is the author from New York City?,"What's up with all these ""reviews"" that are just quotes from others? And all glowing, and all from reviewers in New York?The book had a lot of good points, but it's certainly not a thorough handbook for wedding planning. I think I was giving the book the benefit of the doubt until the section on ethnic weddings. What a joke. If you're Mexican, how about a mariachi band and a pinata! Yeah! If you're ""ethnic"" enough to represent it in your wedding, you'll probably be able to do a better job than to follow these ridiculously simpleton and stereotypical suggestions."
3,book was good,"I ordered the book because my daughter is a lesbian and she is getting ""married"" in August 2011. The book was in great shape, the content of the book was not really what I wanted. I wanted more infomation on how to write invitations and announcements but it didn't touch on that. It did have a lot of information on where to go to get married and places to buy things for gay and lesbian weddings though"
1,Never Buy From Seller!,I ordered this book in September and have yet to receive it! The sellers have not answered any of the emails sent and now I am out the money. Never buy from this seller!
2,Disappointing,"I found this book quite disappointing (and not just because the text contained grammatical errors and typos in places). The back cover claims ""...archeological proof...indicate that the Great Pyramid was constructed with the assistance of the High Priests of Atlantis."" However, there is no proof offered in this book, just theories and hypotheses. It's like a very long episode of ""In Search Of..."" where you never actually get an answer. I also found the photos included in the book useless for the most part. Many were of the author standing in ancient ruins. Big deal. Some drawings of maps of the ancient world would have made much more helpful companions to the text. The research talked about in the book is very interesting, but it proves nothing. In fact, some of the research studies contradicted each other. Very very disappointed in this book."
2,Technical and messy book,"This textbook is too technical, even for stat PhD students, and does not introduce many ideas and concepts. However, the biggest problem is that this book is not technically correct. Many proofs pretend to be complete, but actually there are many gaps and many important propositions are left unproved. The book should be honest about what they prove and what they do not prove.The only advantage of the textbook is clarity in statements, not in proofs. If you want to refer statistical theorems in measure-theoretically sophisticated way, this is a good reference."
1,An Utterly Useless Book!,"This is an utterly useless book.Most of the essential theorems are not proved but left as an exercise to the reader. If the reader already knows how to prove these things, why buy this book.Stay clear of this book and don't waste your money."
3,"Impractical, obscure, eclectic","Too many seemingly unrelated topics with little attempt at unification. Equations rather than concepts. No attempt to relate concepts to practical applications. Nothing on the L1 norm. The brief section on permutation tests (and permutation tests applied to ranks) is laughable.On the plus side, contains many exercises of value to those whose emphasis is on distributions. Good support for the use of the bootstrap in hypothesis testing though no attempt is made to unify or select among the varying approaches to improved CI's."
1,Marine propulsion,"Book deals more with theory and ""what if"" topics than providing had core factual data. If you are looking to optimaze your prop diameter and pitch, look someplace else (talk to you local propeller house. You will get better information for less time and money expended)."
1,VERY UNHAPPY,"THIS IS JUNK. I CAN SEE WHY YOU DID NOT GIVE MEASUREMENTS. I HAVE A 5 IN. VISE,I CAN NOT DO ANYTHINGWITH THIS.THIS IS FOR A MINI VISE. YOUR CO. SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO SELL SOMETHING LIKE THIS."
3,Not what I wanted...,"I ordered these to replace another pair of Harbingers that I lost. Not sure what model those were, but they were white with black trim. Long story short, I was surprised to find that the wrist wrap had no elastic to it, it is just a piece of cloth. I found this really uncomfortable and not really supportive, as well as hard to get the correct tension in the material. I returned them to Amazon.Also - be forewarned when ordering that Harbinger's idea of hand size is off by a full measure. I initially ordered ""Large"" (I'm an average size guy, 5'8"") and I couldn't even get my hand in the glove so if you think you're ""normal"", make sure to get the XL size."
3,Just OK,The wrist wrap on these gloves doesn't really cover my wrists - it barely covers my wrist bone so is not really supporting it at all which is the purpose of these gloves. The sizing of the gloves seems pretty accurate though.
3,not so happy with this product..,"the padding is a bit too thick making your grip weak because of a comfort issue.. i have small hands and i took the medium size.. i think it would be better if you get these two sizes up.. overall, it is a good bang for the buck."
4,"So far, so good.","Tight support on my wrists. A very nice look. So far, I am pretty satisfied. They have got a good grip."
4,Good Product,"Needed a replacement for my previous gloves. Went with these because of the wrist strap. Decent product in a pinch. Stitching feels cheap and like it's ready to break at any moment, even though after 2 weeks solid use it hasn't. The wrist wraps aren't that great. there is no elasticity to them making it difficult to get a tight and proper fit around your wrist. Over all, it's a decent product that is serving it's purpose with no major performance issues."
5,Quality,"Survives pretty well in a tough workout environment. Wrist strap is good. The finger openings are starting to unravel from pulling them off, but not too bad."
3,Alright,"Harbinger is an amazing company for just about anything.This would be my 2nd pair of the same type of glove. The other pair lasted about three years of weight training. This 2nd pair is ok. It feels real tight even though it's the same size as my last one's, I don't recall them being this tight."
3,Harbinger Pro WristWrap,"I wish I was able to compare this and the WristWrap Classic before I bought it. I most likely would have gone with the Classic. Since I have a hurt wrist, I really need the support. The Classic has a wider wrap, and is also more flexible. The Pro wrist wrap is canvas and a bit inflexible. I need the wrap to be snug to give me maximum support.So I'm a little disappointed.Nonetheless, they still give me MUCH more support than when I would work out without them."
5,best gloves I've used,These gloves will last about 2 years - going to the gym 4 to 5 days a week. These are my 3rd pair and I'll buy a 4th in 2 more years.
3,Harbinger represent good quality products (most the time),"I purchase this for my girlfriend she's starting training in the Gym and she obviously needs a good pair of gloves. I thought this was a good option since the price is really good ($18 for the size ""S"" gloves) I wasn't expecting a top of the line gloves and this are definitely not a top of the line gloves. But to be honest this are ok especially for the price. There's not much padding but I'm not sure if women gloves suppose to have that. The way I see it this are good maybe for cardio training or light weigh lifting. But definitely they are not good for medium or heavy weigh lifting since the padding is next to noting. So in conclusion this gloves may be for you depending of the use you plan to give them."
2,Worst gloves I've ever used,"I've had lots of weight lifting gloves with the wrist wrap, and these are by far the worst I've ever used. The wrist wrap is part of a weird flap that comes over the top of the hand and no matter how you put them, you get a bunched up lump on the wrist that just does not work at all for wrist support.Valeo is a much better alternative."
2,It tears out after about 2 weeks of use,Feel a bit cheap with this product and it tears out after 2 weeks of use.I will have to try another product when it comes to buy gloves again.
5,GREAT GYM GLOVES and LOVING THE STRAPS,"I have used this item for now over 3 weeks and I have to say its a absolute top notch quality product. Super solid, thick, and the read and black in my opinion looks slick. By far my favorite feature are the straps. Works great when Im working out my traps and lifting heaving wieghts the straps allow me to hold on to the bar to accomplish longer retetions. Im sold with these gloves and will be a long time customer on Harbinger products."
5,Great!,"I lift heavy. I used to go bare, but wearing these make lifting so much more comfortable. No more skin/calluses ripping off my hands. Only thing people may not enjoy is that the padding is rather thick making gripping bars a bit harder, but the way I see it...it just helps my forearms get a better workout. Good quality product. Highly recommended."
5,Excellent,"I've been using Harbinger products for years. They make an excellent product, durable and tuff. I purchased my last gloves over 7 years ago. They are still in good shape, but I felt it was time."
4,Works well,these gloves works very well because of the material used in making these gloves. I like how they leave room for your finger becasue it get real hot when your working out. Its a palm saver!
5,Very good gloves,These are the best gloves I have found for weight lifting. The wrist wrap works well for added wrist support. They are made very well and last a long time. Amazon processed and shipped the order quickly. As usual great service.
3,Needs to improve quality control; Left glove has subpar stitching,"This is a good glove. It is designed to be sturdy and, when stitched well, this glove will last you for at least few months if not years. I use this for lifting all types of weights including weight lifting machines, free weights, and dumb bells.My main problem with this glove is that the left glove has very bad stitching and fell to pieces in various areas. The finger wrap area came apart and then the nylon yarn in the wrist area started to come off. This happened on the very first day of usage.The right glove has good stitching and works well.I would actually buy this glove again knowing that I probably received a defective left glove and it is probably not that common. But the quality control of Harbinger needs improvement."
3,School,I purchased this book for a college course. It is what you would expect from when you order a college reading material.
5,New angels,"OK, I promise that I will never ever say something bad about the No Angels again. All five girls have pretty voices and they can dance very well. And they wrote this song on their own.This is a great Popsong with an awesome beat and great lyrics. The bonustrack ""Like ice in the sunshine"" is a nice summersong.Tracklist:Something about us: Latin radio mix, R n'B radio mix, Club mix, Extended mix.Like ice in the sunshine"
3,range is a problem,"this a great radios but still consider the range as a problem, good for 2 or 3 miles range and then, well you can try it..."
1,Self Wipe Toilet aid,Great idea but not good in real life. For person with no ability to bend and limited upper body strength this product did not help at all. The product did not clean enough so that there was still necessary clean up needed. It was also hard to release the paper once he was done.
4,Works Great Considering The Alternative,"I have no trouble at all getting the job done with this tool. It is extremely important to follow the instructions word for word, as it does not work the way you may think it would without reading them. I have no problem with the tissue staying in place, and no problem with it easily & cleanly sliding off into the toilet when released. I had lower back surgery a week ago, and until 2 days ago my devoted spouse was performing the job for me manually. Believe me, this method has proven highly preferable for both of us."
4,very satisfied,I bought this product for a family member who just undergone surgury and had issues wiping his butt he realy likes it and is gratefull i got it for him.. it gives him a lil self esteem..
1,Waste of money!,This is more trouble than it's worth. Trying to put the paper on the roller and get it to stay where it belongs is work in and of itself.If you want the one that's the best (in my opinion) go for this one:Bottom Buddy Toilet Tissue Holder Helper
2,This one is a dog.,"If you like war flicks don't waste your money on this one. After about an hour I was ready to take this DVD out of my player. Not long after that I was sorry I spent any money on this one. Spend your hard earned cash on ""Saving Private Ryan"".That one's a keeper."
5,excellant one of the best war movies in history,excellant movie the characters were the best ever the movie was heartstopping one of my favorite movies ever WHAT A THRILL
2,A lesson for directors,"Watch this outdated, macho, adolescent film and then watch Malick's 1998 remake. Watch how the exact same dialogue in the exact same scenes come out corny and inflected here and then watch the sublime subtlety of the new version. Dullea and Warden are wonderful, but overall this is just melodramatic pap."
4,A very good war movie depicting the brutality of war.,"I recently viewed this film and it is a forgotten masterpiece. Fortunately with Terrence Malik's remake, this film has been resurrected. It conveyed the horrors and brutality of war and the inner conflicts which reside in man; then there is the ""thin red line"". The book is a masterpiece among war novels and this film depicts only a small section of the book. The combat scenes were realistic, yet without the gore. Andrew Marton's direction was sharp and truly heightened the dramatic intensity especially in the scenes between Warden and Dullea. Although I have yet to see Malik's remake, I am happy I was able to catch this version and will wholeheartedly recommend it."
3,"Great film , poor transfer !","Personally, I like this film better than the more recent remake. Very strong performances especially by key actors Warden and Dullea. I do have a problem, however, with the overall quality of the film as transferred to the DVD format. Sound quality is very poor (there are times when you can barely hear the dialogue over the background hiss) and visuals are likewise spotty. This could have used a little bit of ""cleaning up"", although I'm really not sure if this is possible given the age and relative obscurity (hence probably not properly taken cared of) of the film. This should just have been released in cheaper formats (e.g. MPEG-1 / VCD or VHS) due to the very minimal (if any at all) ""added value"" in terms of audio/video quality in DVD format. I hope they eventually come out with a better, cleaner version for DVD though."
2,The Thin Red Line between good and bad acting,"I thought I remembered this as being a good movie when I was a kid. Upon seeing this movie again, some thirty-five years later; I was wrong. The acting is terrible and the story has more than a few technical flaws that really irked me. Such as the soldiers with no grenandes hanging from their web gear (they magically appear during the battle scenes), or only one BAR in the entire company, and no one wearing bandoleers of ammo for their M-1 rifles. And one of the biggest faux's was the use of German MP-40's (9mm subguns) by both the Americans and Japanese (In the Pacific War?).A cheaply made movie (technically speaking) for only the psychological impact. I guess I'm just used to more realism than was displayed in this movie. If you've ever seen bad acting when a soldier is getting shot - a la ""Hell Is For Heroes,"" then you're really going to laugh at the way guys die in this movie. Ugh! I'm donating my video to the local library."
3,Brood on this,"My mistake was in expecting this movie to follow the synopsis given. Instead, about midway, the entire plot shifts from an intriguing detective yarn to a bizarre end of the world scenario. What one has to do with the other is anyone's guess. Yes, I suppose it's the filmmaker's right to abruptly change genres but for someone who's expecting one thing, only to be told, never mind, it's not what you thought, it's another matter entirely, it's a bit of a cheat. It's like changing channels from CSI to Supernatural at the half way mark. As a viewer, I hate being purposely misled.That said, after awhile, I did get used to Kiyoshi Kurosawa's willy-nilly approach to filmmaking and found parts of this film interesting if not enjoyable. Would I ever watch it again, definitely not."
5,"A family favorite, even mom likes it!","Another gift from our friend - ""Slinky Malinky jumped high off the floor, hung on the handle and opened the door""This is a fun, rhythmic book that the whole family enjoys. Slinky and his bird friend Stickybeak Sid get into all kinds of things during the day, but have a surprise waiting behind the last door. :)"
5,This CD is one of Houstens Best!,"This CD includes Heartbreak Hotel. This song really has a good beat, most likely the best beat and one of the best sounds I have ever heard! This CD deserves 10 stars."
3,Deutsche Cash,"If you are a Johnny Cash fan or someone who enjoys a little German lingo, you'll probally like this. There are a few songs sung by Cash in German and they are easy to understand. However, there are more songs sung by German singers wanting to be like Cash. I would have preferred more songs performed by Cash."
2,maddening,"If you haven't read the preceding novel with Laciethis book will probably be a good read.BUT..........don't read any further if you haven't read Burnout:::::::Leaving Jack out of the book and for reasons which do not match up with the intense relationship that was established in Burnout, threw me right out of the story. Very, very jarring plot line. Colored Lacie in a not so nice light.I couldn't enjoy the rest of the book. I forced myself to read it."
5,"Through this album, I begining to love the jazz","When I'm 17, listened this album for first time, at this moment understood what's a big band. I was a lucky girl, now I'm 27 and Count Basie is the most fabulous band and I never sing."
4,Piano-Based Combo-Mambo Anyone?? ;),"As the title suggests, this is a collection of tracks done with a mambo feel, in the classic Erroll Garner style. If you're a real Garner fan (like me), you'll probably enjoy it very much. If you're not into the mambo thing, you might have a take-it-or-leave-it attitude towards it. Nevertheless, still a very good disc. It has 2 bonus tracks, has also been digitally remastered, and sounds quite good. Check it out, especially all you budding pianists... Garner is the real deal!"
5,MOST EXCELLENT,"This is the most amazing collection of stained glass work I have ever had the privilege of experiencing. Ms. Perlis is truly an exceptional and talented icon in the stained glass medium. I find the pieces incredibly original, the execution flawless, and the designs dynamic. This is not what one would normally expect to see in a book about stained glass. She has pushed the envelope for design and execution, and deserves high priae for her wonderful work."
4,An excellent college textbook,"This book is the standard college textbook at the two universities where I studied weaving, and includes historical information, practical instruction, and design information. The practical instruction assumes you have a floor loom. Recommended."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Don't waste your money on this ""handbook"". There aremany better books on weaving. This book reads like a collegeinstruction manual for students who will never continue on in weaving. The historical section is the best part of the book. Following the simple historical info section are completely pathetic section on card weaving, inkle weaving and loom weaving. ( ) this book is way way way overpriced! Maybe if it was offered (it for less money) I might purchase it again as a very simple reference manual but I would have some doubts at that! END"
5,Serious swing from the 50's,"If you like small group swing, but especially cleverly arranged charts for the small ensemble versus just head-solo-head, this is a real treat. Recorded in 1956 and featuring some of the era's best swingmen, this disc showcases tenors Al Cohn and Zoot Sims, along with trumpeter Joe Wilder and Urbie Green on trombone not to mention Trigger Alpert on bass, Eddie Shaughnessy (of later Tonight Show fame) on drums and Tony Scott on clarinet. Cohn doubles on bari occasionally for those tunes that hint of a ""four brothers"" influence. 10 charts in all with arrangements by Marty Paich, Dick Hyman and Scott. Highly recommended."
1,Very disappointing,"We were excited when this first arrived because it's real wood and looks great. But a week or so after loading it up with CD's the reality sank in--this cabinet is under-built. The weight of the CD's has caused the doors to sag so much that the front gap is 1/8"" at the top and 5/8"" at the bottom and the doors now drag on the base when opening. Removing all the CDs and tightening the screws did not help. I'm probably going to have to install full-length hinges to fix this inadequate design. Considering the cost, this is a terrible buy."
5,The Whipping Boy,A must read for anyone going into social work. I have read this book over and over again and have never been dissapointed in the story. It is both frightening and sad in the respect that abuse can be in the form of abscured love. The books message is timely dispite the age of the book who's setting is in the 1960's. The characters are complex enough to allow a reader to understand the dynamics behind the bizarre behavior of the parents and children.
4,A different taste...,"In this double session, you can hear a very special sound in Evans' style. I believe this is also because of great Shelley Manne on drums: it is true, he didn't reharsal so much with Evans, but Manne, better than anyother (sorry for Motian, Morrell, Riel, La Barbera...), can support and enhance the intricate rhythmic concept of Evans and he does it with great personality! With Manne, finally, we can enjoy the real trio balance not just two voices + drums as in the historical session at Village Vanguard...but probably Mr. Evans preferred to dialogue just with bass."
5,The foundation of Jewish political life,"Daniel J. Elazar was a pioneer in exploring Jewish political reality. In this work he examines the Biblical foundations of Jewish political life . This is an important element in his enterprise of exploring Jewish political development historically, and providing an understanding of vibrant communal life through the generations."
4,The only possible follow up to Gone with the Wind,It is the only movie that I can think of that the sequel was as brilliant as the origional. I have enjoyed watching this movie over and over again.
4,Siemens Wireless DSL/Cable Router (SS2623),"I bought this cable router along with a Siemens wireless PCMCIA card to network my PC and laptop. I was quite impressed with this product for its ease of installation. The strength of the wireless signal is quite good and reliable. Initially, I ran into setup problems because the encription on the router and the wireless card were different. The printed instructions that come with the package are insufficient but the instructions included in the CD are very detailed. Another excellent feature of this router is that it allows you to add a printer to the network. The setup is actually quite simple and the printer can be shared and accessed wirelessly from the laptop."
2,Un-Expected Result!,"I just buy that product, as I thought siemens have name in the Broadband technology, but after installing it, i get very unexpected result. I used netgear wireless card, install it very easily, but after working sometime, it stop responding. first I thought that there is problem in network card, i remove the drivers re-install it, reboot my laptop, but didnt work, i place my laptop adjacent to the siemens AP but no use. Then i reboot the AP and wow, its worked, but after some time ,it again stop responnding. the next thing i did i return it back, now looking for something else!"
1,DON'T DO IT!,"Setup was simple. Range was good. That's where it ends.I bought this thing because CNET gave it their prestigious ""Editor's Choice"" award. I'll never make that mistake again. Go ahead and read personal reviews there after this and you will see that I'm not alone.DO NOT BUY THIS ROUTER.It kept randomly dropping the connection, requiring a reboot to get it working again. It gets really old rebooting the router 5 times per day, trust me.Tech support will blame everything except the router. Don't bother calling them.This is a very common problem with this router. The guys at COMP USA said that they have had a lot of them returned for the same reason.Don't waste any more time. Go buy the Netgear wireless router, and cards for that matter (especially if you're running Win XP). My system is working flawlessly now. I couldn't be happier."
5,We love it,"Bought this least weekend and have had it up and running for the whole week. Easy set-up, except for printer router. I have HP and I hate their driver setup."
4,"Easy Setup, decent range, no detachable antenna","Great product. Easy, web based setup.The range is decent, but i wish this unit had detachable/replaceable antennas so i could add a high gain antenna to the unit."
1,Wrong part,This tumbler was advertised to fit my 1998 Toyota 4runner. After taking it to a locksmith to he rekeyed found out it's the wrong part. Won't accept a 1998 Toyota key. Now I have to spend my time and money returning the part. Not cool. Losing my faith in amazon.
1,"The Magic ""Leaking"" Cups","In a perfect world, where children never leave their cups on their sides, I would give this product 5 stars. I read one of the earlier reviews where someone left a cup on a table overnight and it didn't leak. That is because the cup remained upright. However, these cups leak tremendously when left on their sides. I can't tell you how many milk puddles I have cleaned up on my furniture and carpet. I thought I was doing something wrong until I read all of the other leaky reviews. Stay away from these cups and the baby bottles!"
1,LEAKS LEAKS LEAKS!,I should have know better because I had problems with Avent's baby bottles leaking fluid out the side of the lid. I read some other reviews and thought I'd give the training cups a try thinking they would be different. I was wrong. I discovered one of my son's cups that he had while playing and it was on its side with almost all the liquid on the carpet. The cap was screwed on so tightly that I almost couldn't get it opened so it wasn't user error. I will never recommend this product to anyone.
2,LEAKY BOTTLES,I bought these bottles because my year old son was having trouble transitioning to the bottle. He liked the soft tip and wouldn't drink from a sippy cup with a plastic tip. Every one of the bottles leak really bad!
2,Love leaks? Then you'll love these,"These Avent cups are very, very durable and put up with a lot of abuse from any overactive toddler. They've fallen off the roof of my car, rolled down stairs, etc. without incident. The parts are interchangeable with other Avent products, which is a big plus.But they leak from time to time where the cap screws onto the bottle. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to this pattern of leakage, but having milk/juice/tea/water run down a toddler's hands and arms is no fun to clean.And cleaning these things can be a real pain. The caps are composed of 5 parts that are nearly impossible to remove once they or your hands are wet. The tapered clear caps are especially difficult to pull off unless your hands are made of sticky tape or sandpaper."
1,I Hate These Cups,The whole point to having these cups is the prevent the liquid in the cup from coming out. Well these cups do not do their job at all. They leak everytime. I hate them! I will never buy another Avent product again. It's not worth it.
1,LEAKY CUPS,"I too liked these cups until they leaked everywhere, what a mess. The diaper bag, car, couch,they leaked from the time I purchased them. I have called avent they sent me some replacement valves, they too did not work. I think avent needs to get there act together and fix this problem. I am returning all of my avent products, requesting a full refund. They should pull these cups off the market. Dont but AVENT products, you will have milk puddles everywhere."
2,They leak,"Initially, when they were new, I didn't have any problems (except not knowing that the pieces come apart and must be cleaned separately until I saw mold)! Within a few months, I noticed that they all leaked. I have several from my first child but will not purchase again because the spill."
2,They leak!!,"I bought these sippy cups because I had heard such good things about the Avent bottles. Well, I was VERY disappointed! They do leak all over the place. They are hard tog et apart to clean also. I would not recommend them thats for sure."
4,so far so good,I like the cups so far. My son seems to like them too. We just took away all bottles and he likes the spout on this cup. After I figured out how to get the pieces apart for cleaning I haven't had any trouble. I haven't had any leaking but I also keep it upright in the side pocket of my diaper bag with the cover on. It's never leaked so far when he's using them.
1,They Do Leak!!!,"I have to say I really HATE these ""Magic Cups"". I listened to the hype, of how these are the best bottles and cups to buy. Boy are you all wrong. I had 6 of these cups and returned them to Avent. I DO NOT think they are worth the price. The cups don't leak at the nipple. It is where the cup meets the lip of the lid. Avent did send me some replacement parts to see if that would help the leaking. But of course it didn't. I have milk spots all over my house from when my daughter would leave the ""Magic Cup"" on it's side. The only thing I can say they have good customer service. But that's all."
2,The best of a bad lot !!!!!!!!,"I first bought these cups probably for the same reason most people will buy them The Avent bottles are fantastic and are I think by far the best on the market so my expectation for these magic cups were high, however I was soon to be dissappointed for the following reasons.They leak from the rim but not from the spout so spill proof would not be a phrase I would use for themThere are so many parts which make cleaning very difficultThe valve system works then doesn't for no apparent reason and frustrates my son no end and the cup ends up being thrown away in frustration.However in this cups defense I have then gone on to try many other varieties of cups and have found that the perfect spill proof easy drink, easy clean cup is just not out there. Gap in the market anyone who can design the perfect cup !!!!!! So come on Avent have another go and get it right this time !!!!"
3,Didn't work for us,"We started out with Avent everything when our daughter was born. I loved the idea that everything was compatible. But we soon ditched the bottles becasue she had severe reflux and she needed something better. But when the time came for sippys we still had these in a box from our shower so we gave them a try. But they didn't work for us either.She had to turn them straight up to drink and it took great force for her to get anything out then. The spouts we too hard for her and she tended to just chew on them. They also leaked just like the bottles if they were tightened too much. So we ended up with the Nubu silicone top cups and she loves them. They have softer spouts, never leak, a double wall so they are somewhat insulated and cute designs.So I would suggest with these and bottles that you just buy a couple and see how your child does. That way you aren't out tons of money if they don't work out and you don't have a kitchen cluttered with useless baby products."
1,do not waist your money,"I purchased the Avent bottles after being told that they help with colic.My daughter had colic very bad and the bottles seemed to help. After a few months the bottles started to leak terribly!! I had recommended these bottles to a friend and I am now embarressed that I did so because their bottles are now leaking as well. When my daughter turned 1 I thought I would give the sippy cups a try since they had the soft spout and looked a bit easier to suck from than others. My daughter took to the sippy cups quite well. Again, after a few months they started leaking. The whole Avent system is a great concenpt how everything is interchangeable. BUT THEY LEAK ALL THE TIME!!!!! If these bottles/sippy cups would not leak I would give a definite 5 stars. I would not recommend these bottles/cups to anyone."
2,terrible! save your money,"these cups are terrrible. i used the advent bottles so I thought i would love the cups. boy was i wrong. not only are they a pain to clean and take apart, but they leak everytime they are on their side. no matter how careful you are about putting them together, they leak. i bought the playtex sipsters and love them!"
1,I was very disappointed,"I bought this sippy cup because I liked the idea of the soft spout. I have been using this cup since my son was four months old. When I discontinued the bottle I replaced it with this sippy cup. To my surprise, they leaked. I didn't notice before because I would only give him water in it and not very much at that. I hate the avent sippy cups. I threw them all away and used another brand."
1,IT LEAKS!!!,"I experienced the same problem as other reviewers - it does not spill or leak through the spout, but when it is left on its side, I am left with a big mess! Also, I did find that all the parts were overwhelming as far as trying to clean. The reason I bought them was because of the soft spout (trying to get my son off the bottle)."
1,These cups are the worst!!!,I also bought these cups because I liked the bottles and Avent is supposed to be one of the best. Yes they do leak everywhere. I don't care how tight or perfectly you screw the top on they leak in your car and all over your house. And yes they are leaking from the lid but also if there is any liquid trapped in the suction part. They are also a pain to clean because you must pull and pick apart several pieces otherwise the cap will get moldy.I have contacted Avent because I am so upset I want to return all of them but I am still waiting to hear back.
2,In the garbage,"I purchased these cups for my son when he was 13 months old. I was quickly disappointed upon using them. They leaked from time to time while my son was drinking from them. As you might imagine when these cups leaked with milk or juice in them my son would quickly become a wet and sticky mess. They are also very difficult to clean. They actually break down into 5 seperate pieces which was a real pain in the neck for me. If you do not beak them down completely before cleaning them they simply just do not come out clean. I kept these cups for 3 months before I got fed up enough to throw them in the garbage. I have since purchased playtex and gerber cups both of which I recommend, they are easy to clean and no more leaks. Save your money and skip this product."
1,More negatives than positives,"I bought 8 of these cups. My son has been using them for 10 months. I have finally had enough and am going out to buy another brand. They leak around the collar if not tightened properly. They leak at the spout when dropped. There are too many pieces (cup, collar, spout, rubber gasket, hard plastic disc and handles)which make them a chore to clean. Sometimes when my son tries to drink from them, you just hear an ""air"" sound and he is getting no liquid. He must tilt the cup straight up in the air to get the last ounce of fluid out. However, I have not had any mold growing in mine (as other reviewers had happen.) They do have a soft spout which is what drew me to them in the first place since my son was teething at the time. I am very disappointed in this product since I only used Avent nursing bottles and was very happy with them. It seems that Playtex may make a better sippy cup, so I will be purchasing some of them."
1,Terrible product!,"I bought the iBot Web Cam for my Mac, and it was not what I expected. First of all you can't disconnect the firewire cable in order to add a longer cable. Second you need to be in a well lit area, other wise the camera display is very poor. The worst part about the whole thing is the customer service I received from Orange Micro, I will never shop for the products again."
1,Horrible customer service.,"This camera is supposed to be great with the MAC, but I have a problem that the manufacturer (Orange Micro) cannot fix. They say they have a ""few"" complaints, but cannot get the problem duplicated. Now I will probably have to fight with the retailer (not Amazon) that I bought it from to return it."
2,Not as Good as it Looks,"This cover looked great on the website. Didn't look too bad when I received it either. The problem is that it is not Near Long Enough. You can't just leave it like it's shown in the picture. It blows off continuously. It's like throwing a sheet over the grill. You must tie the string that comes with it. When the string is tied, it makes the cover come up about 18 inches. There's a great deal of your grill that is not covered. Only the top of the grill will be covered. The lower half of your grill is left bare. My old cover completely covered the grill. This is supposed to be the same size. It's not. It's also a little thinner than I thought it would be, so won't last too long. It was a cheap price though, so it will get replaced as soon as I find a decent one. It's small enough to be used as a chair cover & might be useful that way. It also would work for a really small grill, but Not the type grill that's shown."
4,Almost what I expected,"The length is short. It won't reach to the ground on my Weber Q gas grill. Otherwise just a cheap BBQ cover. It's ""water resistant PVC polyester"" so I'm not expecting it to be totally waterproof. Just want something to keep the road dirt off."
3,Chef Wally,"The picture is deceitful for sizing as it is short for downward overall coverage. Ensure you get dimensions from vendor. However, it serves the purpose of covering my beautiful outdoor grill from the elements."
5,Beautiful,"This album is beautiful, Caetano's voice is beautiful, the songs are beautiful. If you are even thinking of getting this album it is well worth the investment. Enjoy!"
4,I liked the Top 20 Teachers Better,"I bought this book in a bundle with Top 20 teachers, and parents. I believe if you have a teen this is a great book to give them. I would have loved to have read this when I was in 8-11th grades."
4,Love it so much!!,"Since I'm a great fan of Kay Nielsen, I'm satisfied with this book.About a year ago, I bought his illustration book which collected lots of illustrations from the old version of this book. I was so impressed with those works, I really wanted to get this book. I was literally ached whole body to get this book. So, when I heard the news that company was preparing this edition, I was so happy.Finally, thanks to Amazon, this book came to me. I really thank you for delivering this product fast and safely. Though the letters and some words inside this book are old fashioned, I'm so contented with the way it is. Especially the color of illustraions is so nicely printed."
2,only a marginal reproduction,"This 1977 book is not the beautiful book people remember from their childhood, but only a mediocre reproduction. The illustrations reveal only the shape and design of the originals, but not the magical colors.I bought one to remind me of the original, for about $15, but seldom look at it. To pay the high prices currently being asked seems absurd. Go to a library and see the real book."
5,Great deal for the money!,"I bought this for use in my third grade classroom. It is strong enough to hold 3 large chart paper tablets (probably more, but I haven't tried). It wasn't too difficult to put together as long as you look at the picture. It doesn't roll very well on carpet, but it is probably because it is top heavy with my chart tablets. It isn't a big deal and I would have still bought it even if it didn't roll. The price is perfect for a teacher on a budget (I don't know a teacher who isn't). I also like the extendable poles, although I haven't found a good use for them yet. All in all, it serves the purpose and comes at an affordable price. I would recommend this to any teacher who needs a good, sturdy chart stand."
4,Little bit too top heavy...but still GOOOOD,I bought this to hold over 10 Heavy laminated Posters. It works but it's difficult to roll it across my low carpet.
1,Broken pieces,I received my chart stand and was shocked. Two of the wheels were completely broken. There was rust on the railings. The stand came with no directions. I am appalled!!
3,Two-Way Adjustable Pocket Chart Stand,"Disappointed- Shipment arrived seperate from other items and there were 5 missing pieces. The most important parts of the stand, the five chart rings were missing. So now i have a pocket chart with no rings to hang anything in my classroom next week. Order this directly from Carson Dellosa, they never make these types of mistakes! Amazon refers you back to the manufacturer for missing pieces anyway and wont send the missing pieces themselves. So I'll probably be on the phone all day or just have to return the whole thing to Amazon. What a hassle!"
5,Nine West women's Hazma Boot,These boots are great and comfortable and they are exactly as shown in the pictures provided. The craftsmanship is great. The boots were packaged very well and they arrived well in advance of their promissed date. Thanks.
3,Over-engineered but decent call quality,"My first impression is that whoever designed this product must have liked Kinder eggs when they were younger: everything involves assembly, and the car charger looks like something out of a Bond movie. Although I didn't have any issues with the call quality, the biggest problem was the plastic hoop that connect the headset to your ear - it's flimsy, breaks off easily in your pocket, and isn't particularly comfortable.It's definitely not bad for the price, but I don't think it stands up well to the Motorola range. If you spend a little more, you can get a little more comfort and considerably fewer attachments."
1,Not great Quality,"I bought this because it had a great vehicle charger housing.However, when I paired it with my Samsung Rogue, I found the quality of the earpiece to be less than desired.The signal strength was approximately 3 feet before it would dramatically fail. I would lose the contact with my phone via bluetooth and the sound quality would become scratchy and statically.The housing however, was handy and neat for my car. Too bad I didn't get a chance to use it."
2,Barely worth the goldbox price,"I bought this on a gold box special for $17.99. And that's BARELY what it is worth. It is not like the wonderful description. I can't put my phone in my pocket or it doesn't work, constantly breaking up and muffled. The phone has to be fairly close(a foot or so) to the bluetooth or the voice breaks up. I am totally disappointed with it. I had previously owned two motorola bluetooth devices, and they were far superior to this. I lost the last one in a house fire and was trying to replace it. Poor choice. It is much larger and not as comfortable and stable as the old one. The regular price on this is about the same as I paid for the other(the motorola), and the quality is far below. I was going to return it, but there is no return choice that lists poor quality as a reason."
4,Great headset,"I've tried other bluetooth headsets and the biggest problem I've had is not being able to hear others from my car with all the road noise. The Plantronics 665 is great. In fact I actually had to turn down the volume a bit. I also noticed it connects instantly to the phone where my old Motorolla had a slight delay. I would have given this 5 stars except a lot of background noise is picked up by those on the other end of the line. Overall a very clean design. Other than the road noise, people on the other end didn't know I was using a wireless headset. Nice small design fit my ear well. The DC charging station/dock for the car is great. Charges as well from your PC USB. I'm using this with my Palm Treo 755p."
4,"Good headset, could use better ear pieces.","The earpieces don't go as far into the ear as my etymotic earlpugs, so I have to use the wire hook it came with to stabalize it. I wish the in-ear part gripped my ear a little better. Also, the hook falls off easily when it's in my pocket. I wish there was a more permanent way to attach it. Also, there are some CRAZY big ear gels in there. I have big ears (har har) and I use the smallest one. WHOS ears are big enough for the large attachments?Having said that, the headset is a winner. It's LOUD! I actually have to turn it down. Reception is good and it pairs with my L2 quickly and easily. No problems hearing other people or them hearing me.Last thing... it pairs up with my Mac G4 no problems. System sounds go through it and that's pretty cool!I give it a 4 out of 5."
3,Discovery 665,"i bought this last month because it was on sale for only $15 i believe... it's an ok bluetooth headset, the only thing i don't like is the flimsy earpiece, and sometimes i can't hear the other person unless i press the headset closer to my ear. sound volume is really small...."
2,The Discovery,"The product arrived within days of the order and it was sleek in its appearance.Yet that's where the excitement ended. Call volume was low and the amount of staticwas unbearable. I really expected more from Plantronics. Too say the least, thisproduct was returned due to poor sound quality."
3,Breaks apart in your pocket!,"This is a great ear piece at a very inexpensive price... now only if it'd stay together in my pocket.There's an ear loop that is placed in between the gel ear tip and ear piece itself and every time I put it in my pocket and quickly try to take it out, I always find myself bumbling with three separate pieces. I found this to be very annoying.Also, when you charge it, make sure you unplug after several hours. I let it charge overnight and left it at home when I left work. When I came back, it freaked out and was unresponsive. I had to wait until the battery died again to charge and get it to work again.Pros: Inexpensive, comfy, sleek designCons: Breaks apart in your pocket"
2,Poor Bluetooth Connection,"Bought this several months ago from a local store and I am disappointed. I have used several bluetooth headsets in the past few years that I have either lost or broke including:Logitech Mobile Freedom (Ear loop broke, not replaceable)Jawbone (Speaker part broke from the headset)Motorola H300 (Lost)Out of all the headsets I have owned, this one has the weakest bluetooth connection. I typically keep my phone in my shirt or pants pocket and with the other headsets I have used this is not a problem. With this headset the signal cuts in and out and it is difficult to have a conversation.I am looking for a new headset and based on my prior experience it needs:Excellent range and quality for the bluetooth connectionLong battery lifeDurable and replaceable partsLike to have a user replaceable battery"
1,Waste of money!,"I'm about to call the manufacturer to enforce my warranty rights!This device is pitiful. I can only be about 2-3 feet away from my phone, in order to not encounter any interference during my calls.The USB charger is fine if you are always around a computer. Even the connection to the device is flemsy. It is a little tip or nob that barely stays in place when connected to the device. It takes me about 6 minutes to find the right position to set the device on its side and visually ensure that the connection is intact so that it charges properly.The literature claims that the device carries out approximately 3.5 hours of talk time; however, I've barely gotten close to an hour's worth of continuous talk time on it.I do not recommend anyone purchasing the Plantronics Discovery 665!"
2,Poor quality,Everyone I talk to says they cant hear me or they cant understand me. Only reason I bought this is because my other plantronics earpieces have been great. I like the style but the quality is not good. I have a co-worker with the same device and he took his back to best buy for refund for the same reasons.
1,Ear bud & loop falls off making it useless,"This would have been a great bluetooth if it weren't for the fact that the silicone earbud and the wire loop would repeatedly come off and I'd lose them--without even one of those two pieces, it won't stay in your ear, rendering it useless. Since many people do keep the bluetooth in their pocket, I can't understand why they would design it so the earpiece detached so easily instead of a permanently-attached ear loop like on the Motorola's. So now having ordered a replacement ear bud and loop TWICE, at twelve bucks including shipping each time, I've lost them again and am going to dump this and buy a Motorola--thanks for wasting my money, Plantronics!"
2,Possibly incompatible with the BlackBerry Curve,"When paired with my BlackBerry Curve, the Discovery 665 worked very poorly for me. In fairness, before condemning the Discovery 665 I would have to try it with other phones and/or try my phone with other Bluetooth headsets. But I don't have time for that. So I am only comparing this experience with past ones involving older phones and Bluetooth headsets, all of which worked much better.Using this unit with my Curve, during any call in progress (from initiation onward) I heard a subtle, but noticeable sound like a resonant hollow tube; I heard bad, deep distortion or choppy audio on my end; and the people I spoke with heard my voice subjected to heavy audio compression artifacts (like the swooshiness you hear in very low resolution mp3 audio.)The Discovery 665 seems to work well for others, but I am returning mine for a refund. I gave it two stars for good ergonomics and ease of setup and use."
1,Plantronics 665 Bluetoothe,I would not recommend the Plantronics 665 to anyone. The noise on the other end was horrible. I returned it and got a JawBone. This Bluetoothe is amazing. I recommend if you buy a Bluetooth buy this one. You will love it.
2,Not usable,"I used this product for a few days and I returned it right away. I have had difficulty finding a bluetooth headset that was loud enough to hear while driving my car. I have had other models where the earpiece stayed outside of the ear canal and after hearing this model goes in your ear, I thought I'd give it a try. Initially, it seemed loud enough but what really bothered me about it was the static. I would have my phone on my belt on my right side of the body and this ear piece on my left ear. Whatever I did, I would always hear static and the calls were never clear. I tried putting the phone on the same side as the head set and it was a bit better but I'm accustomed to the location of my phone and headset and am unwilling to pay nearly $100 for this."
2,False advertising,This did not come in original box as advertised even with photo. It arrived in loose pack bubble wrap with no instructions.
3,Could not stram music over to the headset,This headset is a very good one with good audio quality.My only problem with it was it couldn't stream music to it. I mean I couldn't listen to music files of movies from my mobile (which was android based) on it.Other than that it works fine.
5,Edges out the Jawbone,"In my mind there are only 2 bluetooth headsets to consider right now, the Aliph Jawbone and the Plantronics 665. I owned the Jawbone and this headset. They both are fine in terms of noise cancellation and clarity. Miles ahead of the competition. I prefer the Plantronics in the end though. I can wear it all day and barely notice I'm wearing it. The Jawbone starts to hurt the back of my ear after an hour. 'Pocketability' is better with the Plantronics as well. I can keep it in my jean pocket and not worry about breaking it. I thought it looks better as well than the Jawbone. I also find if I keep the headset in my pocket and pull it out the Plantronics is easier to stick in / on my ear than the Jawbone. Upgrading from any other headset you won't be disappointed with either headset but the form, style and charging options made me stick with Plantronics over the Jawbone."
2,Not good in the car,"I previously owned a Plantronics 645 which I liked quite well, but it came time for a replacement. I typically only use the headset in the car, so I was looking for one with good noise cancelling features. After using this headset for about 2 weeks, I received so many complaints from the people on the other end of the calls, that I had to stop using the headset and use my handset directly - just so they weren't completely annoyed.I really like the fit, feel, and weight of the unit, and the incoming sound quality was always excellent. When I was stopped at a traffic light, outgoing sound was very clear and nice, but unfortunately even the slightest road noise was a big issue.I really wanted to keep this headset because I still have some older accessories that are compatible, but unfortunately I will have to return it. With the DSP technology and Audio IQ I expected this headset to be better than my 645, while it ended up being much worse."
3,Forget the noise cancelling,"Take away the noise canceling and this is a great little headset. With the noise canceling feature turned on I am told that I sound like crap on the other end. Most people tell me they hear more noise (strange whooshing sound) than with it turned off. When it is turned off I have trouble hearing the person on the other end if there is any noise around even with the volume turned up all the way. With it turned on I can hear the other party better but because it makes me sound so bad I just keep it turned off. I bought this to replace a Jawbone that stopped working. It is much more comfortable and I actually like the charger/holder. However, since I need the noise canceling I will be replacing the Jawbone - the noise canceling on it works great."
1,"Good from my end, bad from theirs","I had heard great things about this headset but I think it is terrible. Although I could hear other people quite well (hence the 1 star), I kept getting comments like ""are you under water?"", ""what's that swishing sound?"", ""do you have the windows open or the fan turned way up in the car"", and my favorite ""oh no, you're not on that horrible headset again are you?"". Suffice to say, I'm looking for another bluetooth headset. Too bad, since I've loved my other plantronics headsets."
2,Very poor battery life,"Pretty good little unit if you don't use it too much. Nowhere near the claimed 3 hour battery life. If you have a cell phone you use less than 1000 minutes a month, this might be the one for you. If you use your phone for business like I do, over 3000 minutes a month, then DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT. I am a lifelong Plantronics customer and I cannot recommend this unit for business use."
2,disappointed,"My friend had great things to say about this head phone. But it sucks. If I have my blackberry on one side of my body, and the headset in the opposite ear, it crackles with static. Seriously. My body provides too much resistance in a 3 foot range. I'm returning this POS and getting a jawbone"
2,Disappointing Plantronics Discovery 665 headset,"I have had 3 of these units. The first a lost because it was so light that I did not realize it had fallen off of my ear. By the time it was found, weather conditions had destroyed it. The second was my fault that it was destroyed. I did like the product enough that I purchased a third one. I had it about six weeks when the ear gel piece fell out and would not stay snapped in. I replaced that one and my ear became so sensitive that it was extremely painful to insert or remove it, and within about six weeks that ear gel unit fell out of the body. Because of the apparent allergenic nature of the ear gels and the fact that they tend to fall out of the main body of the unit I have opted for a different product."
1,Don't Even Waste Your Time,"Don't even think about buying this product; there is a huge design flaw that severely outshadows any of the positives. The gel ear buds do not stay on the headset. To put them on and take them off, you put the bud in the ""neutral"" position then push it on and then twist it to the right or left, depending upon which ear you prefer. The problem is that the bud keeps rotating back to neutral and then falls right off. I complained to the Plantronics company and they told me where I could purchase replacement parts! I told them I wasn't paying for replacement parts for a product that was very poorly designed in the first place. This headset has been returned but I just wanted to warn everone who had read the excellent reviews about the product to not even consider this one."
1,Industrially Dumb Design,"Plantronics was good enough to send me a new pair of these, after I complained about the earbud and clip falling off at inopportune moments (are there any that aren't inopportune?) But the new pair had the same design flaw: the earbud connects to the headset by way of some flimsy plastic nubs - or perhaps they're better described as nublets. Once the bud is positioned inside the headset socket, it must be turned an 1/8th turn to 'lock' into place. The trouble is, the thing never really locks in, and over time it just defaults to the neutral (unlocked) position. So fairly frequently the earbud pops out of the headset socket and flies off somewhere. The over-ear clip flies off too, though not usually as far. It's just a poor design choice to have a crucial mechanism hanging on by such a tiny thread. Nevertheless, if you can keep the 665 in your ear long enough to make a phone call, it sounds pretty good."
3,Great sound needs work on the ear piece,"I would have given it 5 stars except the ear gel locking mechanism does a poor job of staying in place. Had to crazy glue the darn thing in place to keep from always having to crawl around the floor looking for it every time it fell out. Great crips sound, loud enough for a noisy environment or some what deaf person like me."
1,Voice sounds muffled...,"I have had this Plantronics Discovery 665 Bluetooth headset for two days and everyone I call tells me I sound very muffled. I can hear them fine, but they cannot understand me. They can hear me, but cannot understand what I am saying most of the time. I am returning this item."
4,Excellent sound quality on both ends,"I have been using the 665 for over a month - it has great sound quality for me, and for the listener on the other end. It stays in my ear better than the headsets that require that you use the over-ear piece - I have long hair and this earpiece is the ONLY ONE that I don't have to use 2 hands to keep in my ear. My only complaint is the charging component. For me, when you have to use 2 pieces to charge something - it increases the chances for losing one of the pieces. The 665 requires that you put the headset into this holder; and the holder plugs into one of 3 chargers that you receive with the headset. I DO like the holder because it HAS A CLIP on it - which I use quite often (and I think it's great that they supply a charger for car and USB connection as well as electrical outlet)"
4,Best headset ever had,Good1. Excellent Clarity of sound.2. Never disconnected from the Phone like my other bluetooth headsets.3. Light weight.4. Elegant Charger.5. Easy to setup.6. Charge stays longer.Bad1. The key to answer the call is not comfortable.
2,Noisy in the car!,"This headset is fine as long as you don't use it inside the car. If you do, the hum (road noise, wind noise, etc.) is almost unacceptable on the listener's side."
4,Plantronics 665 Bluetooth Headset,"I have used Motorolla Bluetooth Headsets before and they are incredibly bulkly and ugly. The 665 is sleek and elegant looking. The sound quality is very good, every thing that I expected. The 655 includes a house charger but not the 665, I think that is the only technical fault. It doesn't make sense to charge it in the car cause thats when you need it, so the only other option is to charge it on the computer. The ear gel tips finish pretty quickly and I have already bought the replacements. I believe that the 655 offers more features, should have bought the 655 instead of the 665."
3,I Had An Immediate Opinion On The Families,"I couldn't stand the Governor's family(the adults) the minute Ifirst saw them in the boat.The second family I couldn't stand was the Minister's family(the adults)the minute they opened their mouths on the boat.Loved the English lad,plus the poor kid working for the obnoxious Ministerand his wife.."
2,deserves the low ratings,"As many people did, I watched this following the far more interesting and enjoyable Frontier House. I agree that it was a complete disappointment. The producers clearly couldn't get a handle on it when it went off the rails and the ""experiment"" never recovered, it just kept getting worse. In the end, you find yourself watching it just to mock some of the participants and waiting for the inevitable new low. At some point, someone at PBS should have pulled the plug on this. I'm not sure why they didn't, but the end result is a show that just limps along, failing to educate, entertain, or otherwise fulfill any useful purpose."
2,stop the bickering and follow the rules!,"This Colonial House was my least favorite of all the House series. The volunteers were not well chosen because they belly ached and refused to make it an authentic experience. Some did not play by the time period rules--very aggervating. I would love to be a part of these experiments and I can't stand when someone wastes the opportunity.While still a fascinating series, I wasn't drawn in like some of the other House series because of the constant conflict."
3,It's alright.,"If you're looking for a authentic reality show where it will be respected historically then Colonial House might not be for you. I did enjoy some of the families and people in the show and some of them really did a good job at throwing themselves back in time, but too many of them were stuck in modern times and dragged it in without much of a consequence and unfortunately that destroyed the value of the project. Overall, I personally enjoyed watching it, as did my husband, but we were disappointed that they didn't remove people from the project that didn't seem to want to stick with it. Though, in a way, I guess that shows how we got to where we are now, because of people like those who weren't ""typical""."
4,Entertaining,"Well, there was a little too much drama and not enough of the grit, but an entertaining look at what it would be like to live in colonial times. It is unfortunate that these shows don't go for longer. Always seems that they leave just when they are getting used to the work and the lifestyle."
2,FULLER 620-0136 4-Piece Nail Set,Cheap quality. They rusted quickly. I am a full time carpenter so I depend on quality tools. I suppose these would be fine for an average home owner who likes to tinker around. They don't meet up to the demands of the job.
5,Not from the Biography Channel...,"I pre-ordered this as soon as I was able, being a Huge fan of Mr. Gould, and not disappointed in the least. Those whose roots with Gould are not quite that deep yet, I would suggest some of the other DVD titles listed here on Amazon first. This isn't your typical biography produced for the masses, but more focused on Gould's craft & thoughts. There are many unscripted scenes that had been previously been introduced to the editor, where you witness Mr.Gould seeking perfection in the recording studio. I could go on & on, but would like to thank Bruno Monsaingeon for producing another treasure about Glen Gould. A must have!"
4,Wonderful,I believe that most people either adore Glenn Gould or cannot stand his style and interpretations. I for one still cherish my original Goldberg Variations LP recording!This film is worth viewing and listening to because: Gould explains ever so many things regarding how and why he recorded music and performed music in the manner which made him an Icon during the height of his career. I happen to consider Bruno Monsaingeon a wonderful maker of art films and this is one of his best.
4,Glenn Gould: Hereafter,"It is truly an intriguing ""document"". A genius is portrayed well but also his not particularly stable personality characteristics.That does not take anything away from the musical creativity of the man. I have always enjoyed his piano playing but now I am able to appreciate it more. A well-done documentary."
