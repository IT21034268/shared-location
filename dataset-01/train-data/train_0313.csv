2,Not that good,"This book will only teach you to spew chips. I have been a winning poker player and i can tell you that there are better books on the market for low limit hold em. ""Winning low limit"" is a good book by lee jones. This book teaches how to raise without having a pair or a draw. If thats how you like to play poker you will like this book. Save your money and practice online and buy a better book. It is also poorly written"
1,Remember this guy--buying in over and over,"I have tried several times to read this book and my copy has numerous bookmarks to show my attempts. The editing and grammar are jokes, but more than that the advise, according to one fellow I played with in Vegas, gave him the knowledge to buy in over and over five times (while I played with my same money). This fellow said I could never understand Sklansky--Boy, was he was right! He left the table penniless, while I played all night on my initial stake.Sklansky needed an editor, somebody to make an index, and (in general) somebody who knows how to make a good read even if his advise is horrible...Skip this book by all means. A real waste of money..."
4,Very good for people that play mostly small stakes Hold'em,"I bought this book several years ago and gave it to a friend of mine after reading it. I just started playing small stakes again after several years of not playing. I remembered this book being really good so I purchased it again. This time I got it on Kindle so I take it with me as one of the many books I have on my Kindle. I have read it twice in the last month and refer to it when I have a question. I think that if you read and follow the instruction in this book and stick to the proper way to play Hold'em, you will win more often than you lose. I would recomend this book to anyone that wants to start playing Hold'em the proper way."
4,Handle with care,"This book is extremely easy to read, and full of important concepts that are explained in a very easy to understand manner.Some key concepts are: raising for pot equity, finding hidden outs, and don't give up large pots easily.The books only weakness is that is does not spend much time discussing folding. The book has three major assumptions 1. the reader folds too much. 2. Your opponents are bad and aggressive 3. you are playing for a big potThis was an eye-opening book for me, but it's recommendations should be used cautiously."
4,be very careful using this book,"I highly recommend you buy this book, for many reasons.Your opposition has likley read it, so that's a good reason alone. But, there's also some terrific insight into the game to be found.BUT, read this book, then re-read this book, then read it again before you try to put the theory into practice.If you're not careful, this book will cost you a lot of money, because there are a lot of sophisticated plays here.Also, if you are risk-adverse, and don't like to play a high-variance game, this book is not for you.If you are an action player who loves the swings -- and loves raking in big pots -- definitely read this book. The authors' advice will lead you to raise to build pots with hands other books recommend you don't play, and to raise from the blinds more often than most players will be comfortable with.A great book, but only if you don't mind having a large variance, and if you have a big bankroll. You'll need it to withstand the swings."
1,useless,"this book is useless, you play the player not the cards. you still can win any match if you know how your opponent plays."
1,I threw this book in the trash. It is a worthless badly written book.,This is a pathetic excuse for an actual book. The writing is bad. The writing is neither clear nor concise. The book offers no tactical advice. I got the impression that this author merely wants to have a book to sell to suckers like me. I regret buying this book. This book sucks. I have tossed the book into the trash. I can usually glean something of merit from any book. This book is the exception. There is nothing to be gained by reading this book.
5,Convenient and Cost Effective Breakfast,"I am single and live in an apartment with a small galley kitchen. I do not do much cooking. I bought these cereal cups originally to take to work for a fast breakfast each morning but I find myself eating this relatively healthy food as a nighttime snack as well.The portion is perfect for an adult to eat. The convenience of having the sturdy plastic cup as the container cannot be beat. Tear off paper sealed top, pour milk, eat and throw away.Three weeks later, I have not noticed any staleness in the product, which was my only concern with buying 60 at one time."
5,My husband loves this stuff,"When it arrived, my husband thought I was nuts. Now he has one every day. I can't keep him away from it. Who knew?"
2,The Price Is Wrong,"The music took on a silent movie role and was annoying, never pleasant or entertaining. The story totally escaped me. Only the wardrobe prevented me from removing the DVD before the closing credits. Very disappointing."
3,She's working too hard. Overwritten.,"There is no reason not to like this fantasy-like lore of an early English warrior queen. The idea is fantastic. The problems are:-Manda Scott goes on forever. Philip Pullman can give you a terse sentence describing a place, and you'll know what he means and the way it makes the characters feel in the way you can get the sense a place by glancing around. Manda Scott is not so blessed. She uses language naturally well - everything is well-written - but it's OVERwritten. (P.S. I confess that I never finished it.)-Breaca's character is nothing special and you are stuck with her for 500+ pages. Caradoc is not remarkable either.-This is not Ms. Scott's fault, but many people have studied this era so little that this book is confusing.-The whole book is so dark and mysterious, it reminds be of the Lord of the Rings DVDs--cryptic, poorly-lit and overlong.But I still give 3 stars for hard work, a good idea, and nice writing."
2,Ho hum,"Compared to other historical fiction such as the wonderful works of Sharon Penman, this book was fairly mediocre. It was overlong, the characters were poorly developed, and the mystical Celtic world seemed as imaginary as much of the characters' interminable ""dreaming"": I think the title of Scott's later book ""Dreaming the Bull"" would have been far more appropriate for this one. Also, the children had such gravity that I thought they must be at least in their late teens, before finding out that they were in fact 11 and 8: such convincing characterisation! I don't remember a single character laughing in the entire 500-page novel: Scott certainly has a gift for writing cheery fiction. However, it gets two stars for sheer size, an interesting premise and some tenderly drawn love-scenes."
5,Great Book,"I'll admit, not many 13-year-olds are going to be reading this book, especially considering that it is an adult book, but it is an amazing piece of literature!True, the plot may be slightly difficult to understand, at least for me, but it is really, really good. It took me about three months to read, and usually a book of that size takes me a week, max, but that was because, for it to really pull me into it, i needed some time, as in an uninterupted hour or more, to read it. (Sorry for the run-on sentence!)Some of the content may be considered ""for adults only"" by many people, such as when, towards the end of the book Breaca sleeps with a man to whom she is not married, but we all know enough about that by the time we turn 13, and if we don't, then we need to learn.Altogether, I say that this is a book well worth the price and time it takes to read and I say we should all propose a toast of long life to Manda Scott for writing this beautiful series!"
1,Disapointing,"I can only speak to the entertainment value of the book, which I found dull and disapointing. As a fan of historical novels, when I purchased this book, I was looking forward to delving into a reconstruction of the Celtic past. I sought a sense of time and place, neither of which I felt were well developed or well researched in this novel. The character development lacked depth or age-appropriate emotion, and I felt I didn't connect or identify with any of them as I was meant to. The author's writing style reads as though it is forced, and many of the dramatic scenes in the book are over-stated or imbued with angst I found difficult to relate to. Most of the relationships the characters develop are pedophilic and perhaps incestuous, a detail I felt unnecessary and at times uncomfortable. It isn't a novel I would recommend, and I won't be following the trilogy."
2,Bust the tape and throw it in the garbage,"I had to watch the movie 3 times to find out what it was about, after I was done, I wished that I had never watched it to began with.The movie is in the SD (super deformed, when the heads are much bigger then they should be) format, and considering the age of the tape the animation is good. However it is missing one major thing, a plot. I think that it is supposed to be a spoof of a different movie, but if it is then I have never seen it."
5,Love the paper.,I used this to make pictures of wedding photos and they turned out well. Great deal.
4,The best so far,"This is the best photo paper I have found so far. I keep a pack of the lesser expensive ""Premium"" photo paper for printing out the good photos but I also keep a pack of this ""Premium Plus"" photo paper for those special shots that I only get maybe once out of every 30 or so photos taken. The only downside I have found with the premium plus...it is too costly. I did search around and found that the price on Amazon.com was the best, even better than individuals selling on ebay. The package arrived 3 days earlier than Amazon said it would. So far I have had nothing but great experiences when buying from Amazon.com."
4,The paper is much better than the printer that prints it.,"I would rather use the thicker Canon paper but it doesn't work in the new HP printer that I bought for home use when my old Canon became obsolete. A home printer is a necessary evil (to print tax forms etc.) and I rarely use the one that I have for printing photographs because of the poor results of the printer, not the paper. My local Walgreen's does a great job in quickly processing the photos that I need and the cost per print is probably less than if I printed them myself."
1,Garbage. Every sheet.,"Purchased this to use in my Canon MP 830 color printer. Using Canon brand colored ink. Printing full-color, photographic quality inserts for CDs. After 6 hours of drying time, the ink still smudges, sticks to facing pages and plastic surfaces, and peels off in smeary globs. Destroyed several beautifully labeled and burned CDs, and their jewel cases, in the process. Bought three packages of this stuff, which is now hitting the circular file. Never again."
4,Brilliant Photos,I wrote a review about this paper (4x6 in).Good heavy paper - feels very good. Photos are beautiful but HP needs to upgrade their ink technology - photos are too sticky for too long and they're not waterproof.
1,"HP Premium Plus Photo Paper, High Gloss",Not at all satisfied with the photo paper backing. I glue my photos into our album and this absorbent backing makes this virtually impossible.
5,Paper is A-OK; Amazon merchant is not recommended,"HP printers generally print pictures best on HP papers with HP ink or toner. So, I have been using HP photo papers for years, and this batch did not disappoint. However, I ordered it through an Amazon merchant that was new to the Amazon supply chain, and they did disappoint. The package was a plain brown envelope, kludged with a plain paper insert and Scotch tape on the side to accept the thicker box of photo paper, and it got damaged in shipping. Several of the sheets of photo paper were visibly damaged in the corner. I wrote to the merchant asking for resolution, but they never replied. I gave them a less than stellar rating elsewhere in the Amazon system."
1,product very disapointing,"HP Premium Plus Photo PaperI needed thick paper to use for business cards.I needed a glossy paperI had read that low gloss is matteWhat I receivedEverything OK except when it came to the printing.Ink dried slowlyInk tended to puddle, cards are not something to be proud of to pass out.Very disappointed in the quality.I have been using the Epson photo paper. The cards come out perfect every time. The paper is too thin to make good cards.Amazon has agreed to return item, a little inconvient, but it does help to know that I'm not stuck with a box of paper that is not of any use. Thanks Amazon."
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS PAPER!,"I bought this paper to be used with an Epson Professional wide-Format Printer (Epson 1400). The first print made with this printer were doen with the HP paper described above. Skin tones were dramatically redissh and orange. Color were overall opaque and shadows, blacks, and other dark colors were overlly dark. I discovered this by printing two exact pictures, and noting the significant diferences (I used two types of paper, another type of Glosy paper, and the HP Premium Plus). I was reimbursed for all teh boxes I purchased, and even the Office Max represenattive told me that many people kept returning this specific type fof paper. Don't waste your money. Try cheaper brands, or cheaper HP papers."
1,Wanna' Buy This,"This looks like a verry good gun and I Wanna' Buy This, but it doesn't even have the nozzle size listed(I need a gun for detail work), if anyone knows what it is, please respond to comment."
4,"Review of ""GOLD "" by The GAP Band","If you love the the GAP band and looking to get a greatest hits compilation,this is probably the one to get. It has the hits you know and some slept on tunes( I Found My Baby, Disrespect, for example ). Lead singer Charlie Wilson is outstanding ( no pun intended)and you can hear P-Funk influences on their early sound as they gradually created their own identifiable funk mark. Not disappointing at all."
5,yummy caramel!!,"I enjoy this caramel flavored coffee, especially in the winter!! I found it to be cheaper online, too.I would recommend it if you like sweet drinks."
1,I'd give it less if I could...,"This debacle is barely worth reviewing. Seriously, even for a reality junky such as myself, this was absolutely rediculous. Dudes kiss dudes, eat jars of mayo and drink pee for 2 hours. All for 20 bucks, it's really stupid. This DVD does, however, make an excellent frisbee..."
1,not as described,Engineered to match original equipment washer pumpsDesigned to fit original windshield washer pumpIncludes Reservoir............. DOES NOT INCLUDE RESERVOIRIncludes all mounting hardwareDON'T HAVE A RESERVOIRpump works good but had to go to salvage yard for the tank
4,worked great in MGB,"I used this as a replacement pump for my '80 MGB (not keeping it original) - works great, though the mounting options are a bit limiting - you may have to use tie wraps or something. Could include some other diamater hose adapters, but it doesn't, so you might need to make a trip to AutoZone to adapt to your existing plumbing."
3,Rider on fhr Rain & Farewell Friend,I enjoyed this dvd with the two movies. Charles Bronson is one of my favorite actors. Always gives a good performance.
3,Not as good as other product,"This is okay, but has artificial colors, sugar alcohols, and other ingredients that aren't exactly natural or as healthy as you might want.I have found another product that helps diabetics and others lose weight with only natural ingredients and high fiber and protein and a unique ingredient to help preserve muscle and metabolism - and end the yo-yo diet cycle safely. It is an ""Amazing Inch Loss Plan . com"" not just a diet or weight loss plan. It has an Ultra Low Glycemic Index of under 25. (Low is under 55.) It focuses on inches because it preserves muscle and muscle weighs more than fat. In fact, 5 pounds of fat is 3 TIMES LARGER than 5 pounds of muscle. So when you lose fat, you lose more inches than weight. It truly is amazing!Plus this is just a shake without all the other components and support you need to lose weight permanently and adopt a healthy lifestyle."
1,THIS IS AWFUL!BUY THE ORIGINAL BY LEE GREENWOOD.,This is the worst cd Ive ever heard.Buy the original song-GOD BLESS THE USA BY LEE GREENWOOD.These kids cant sing.Theysound worse then the BRADY BUNCH.BUY CLAY AIKENS CD.HE IS THE MOST TALENTED AMERICAN IDOL EVER.
1,THIS IS PATHETIC SHAME ON YOU,"DO NOT BUY THIS CD SINGLE.All the AMERICAN IDOL singers sound terrible on this.Buy the original version of GOD BLESS THE USABY LEE GREENWOOD.Or another patriotic cd.But STAY away from thisone.ITS AWFUL,AWFUL.AWFUL.TWO THUMBS DOWN."
1,Making Profit of a Tragedy,"With the recent wave of patriotism, it seems everyone's trying to make money off the phenomenon. even American Idol. I mean, that's all this show is about anyways, making money. Let no one forget just why this patriotism furvor started. And anyone who tries to make money off of that makes me physically ill (just like the quality of music that comes from this show).I guess we can all thank Fox for telling us what an American Idol should be. A random person they do makeup and costuming for, with creative lighting and endless marketing. They created it, so we should idolize it. My American Idol is the police officer working for too little cash but sticking with it. My American Idol is the politician who tells the truth and listens to his constituents. My American Idol is most definitely not what Fox tells me it is."
1,They'll sing anything,"I had the unfortunate experience of catching my one and only full episode of AI on this night. What a shameful display of jingoism and crass marketing it was. As if we all haven't had enough rah-rah about the war, they trot this out. Surely it would fit in as FOXNews's theme song, or better yet, GW's reelection theme. Coming on the heels of a war we knew little about (how many really died?), it's appalling for them to cash in on the fever of it all, and then to make people feel they are helping all the unfortunates, they donate to the Red Cross. What gall! Maybe we'll see some more bombs in the coming months as the ""idols"" release their full-length cds of other peoples' songs."
1,All I have to say is whatever.........,"It wasnt the greatest thing in the world to listen to....i mean it has a great meaning and all but the vocals arnt all that great. Figures since its all coming from american's second best mind u there r actulaay 2 ppl on that show who r actually talented this season andthat is ruben and josh so other tham them i didn't like the single at all. I much recomend Kelly Clarkson's Debut album ""Thankful"" which is in stores now over ths cd......... oh well everyone has there own oppion and thats mine............."
1,Unimpressive,"I dig American Idol, but this song is...blah. With so many talented vocalists, I expected some great harmonies, but no. Nothing impressive, just a bunch of unison -- the only interesting harmonies are drowned out by synthesizers and trumpet. Not worth 2.98, I'm thinking."
3,Charitable Donation,"There is one song on this CD. I thought there would be at least two. Anyway, it is a decent rendition with the ten finalists of American Idol 2. I think Lee Greenwood sings this song better, but if you're fans of the show this may be a nice[] souvenir. And [some]goes to the Red Cross."
2,GOD BLESS THE USA,I absolutely love the rendition that A.I. singers do on this song. I cry everytime I hear it. They've done an outstanding job on this song.
2,Whatever...,"This song is whatever. It's not really worth the money. If you really want it, you could probably download it online or something, although I don't think it's even worth space on your computer."
1,GOD HELP US with this [dreck] !,"This single is BEYOND TACKY.---Semi celebrities from a bad reality television show attempting to cash in on the war factor. --Not a winning formula to earn any GRAMMY nominations!This single is explotive in nature as revenue generated from sales go to FOX Television & their production house ""19 ent"". Unfortunately, the public will be subjected to listening to this bunch of ""UP WITH PEOPLE"" candidate flunkies invade our airwaves with A BAD OVER THE TOP COVER of a lackluster 1980's country song. This TORTUROUS single makes one dream of being trapped in a basement in Nothern Iraq listening to a loop of CELINE DION performing ""MY HEART WILL GO ON"". Unfortunately, the only true talent in this group is vocalist ""Rueben Studder"" & he has very limited solo time on this project. The arrangements make it impossible for him to showcase his vocal gift. I suggest to wait to purchase his solo project instead of this single from a team of high schoolish ""wanna bees"" !"
4,"Nothing special, but not bad.","The song in general was not a very exciting thing to listen to. Yes, the singers (the guys especially) were harmonized well and they were on key, but there wasn't anything extremely special about it.Having Josh for the first soloist was predictable as anything, as he is the token marine of the group. A good choice, but still predictable. Choosing Trenyce as the female soloist, however, I feel was a bad move. There is nothing extremely great about her voice, so that particular moment in the song wasn't carried very well. Also, the singers seem to be a touch defeated by the trumpet near the end of the song. That's not saying anything great about the ten singers as a whole, even if it is meant to be that way.I was originaly going to give this single only three stars, as it's ""just there"", but I gave it four because a portion of the profits gained from the sales of this single are donated to the Red Cross."
1,Just 1 song????,"Oh my god, and I thought Ruben's ""Flying with wings"" was a waste! I bought this and I expected the idols to sing at least 5 or 6 American songs. I payed 14 bucks for this and all it is is just ONE lousy song! Why do they waste space like that and they make a cover for it and everything! Come on, do these idols really care about our Country or are they just trying to get noticed so MORE people will watch their show? This should on be avalible on a music downloads page. Not a CD! And how many CD's does American Idol have...like, 40?? Seriously, they even had to make a MOVIE that has Kelly in it because they thought she was so great!These people don't care about 9/11 or anything, all they care about is that this is a promotional tool so more people can watch their show. Do not buy this."
2,"decent, but not worth it","The most is not terrible, but it is nothing outstanding either. In fact it is like many popular songs already that you can easily find on the radio or the internet. Also I've already heard most of these people on TV and they aren't talented enough for me to want to listen to them over and over.By the way, does anyone else notice the irony of American IDOL contestants singing an album called GOD Bless America? ... what was that commandment again?""You shall not make for yourselves an idol."""
4,Queen,"I liked this movie as a teenaager, I saw it on sale and jumped at the chance to buy it. The quality was excellent, and how quickly I received it was execellent as well. I will be making alot more purchases with amazon.com."
5,So Authentic,"I purchased the DVD after visiting Boone Hall in Mount Pleasant, SC where most of Queen was filmed. I loved how the movie portrayed the life of such an extraordinary woman. It gave me goose bumps to see the movie and know that I had visited the actual plantation where her story was filmed. Extraordinary."
2,Alex Haley's Queen,"I love the movie and own the VHS. The DVD version was cut short. Some great scenes missing from the DVD, I feel robbed. I purchased the DVD for my daughter's birthday. She emailed me from Iraq saying ""Mom I hate the DVD version, half the movie was cut out"". When I watched the movie I fell asleep and thought that was why I missed most of the movie. Please release a full version of the movie....."
5,Perfect Condition,Queen came faster than I thought it would. Would use this seller again. Product was exactly as described in the write up on EBay. That is important to be able to count on. Keep up the good work!!
1,I would give it 0 stars if I could,This dvd was a rip off. It came packaged as a 2-disc set; however when you put in the second disc (that is labled disc 2) the root (title)menu displays the options for episode three or disc three... I thought that was a mistake but when the movie started- suddenly Queen had a baby that was about 15 mos old. There is either a disc missing or I was duped ; either way dont waste your hard earned cash!
5,Well Yessa This Be a Good Movie Massa,"First off let me tell you, this movie is fantabulous if I might say so. I was upset that it took so many years to bring this to DVD. This movie is another excellent film from Alex Haley, God rest his soul. For those of you imbeciles that didn't realize that the rest of the movie was on the second cd need to stop posting reviews saying parts of this movie are missing. Don't believe those lies and buy the DVD."
4,If only for Haley & Berry,"If you loved Roots, go for it. It adds another dimension to what Haley had to say about his family roots.If you are a fan of Halle Berry, go for it. She does a great job.(Ann-Margret too, by the way).If you hate overdramatic stories, especially when you are not sure what the story is aiming at, avoid it. It took me forever to watch it because it made me feel like a bad Danielle Steel movie. There is something cheap about the way the story was used to make this saga come to life (!) on screen.Finally, this mini-series has nothing to do in scope & quality compared to Roots. Je suis déu, très très very much."
5,GREAT,I THINK IT'S A GREAT MOVIE.I WOULD RECOMMEND IT. I THOUGHT IT HAD A GREAT STORY TO TELL.IF YOU LIKED ROOTS I THINK YOU'LL LIKE THIS.THIS WAS A SAGA..........
5,"""Harding Had It All""","Christine Brennan put her Nothwestearn Journalism School education to good use. I was especially moved by the following passage:""Tonya Harding possessed more raw jumping talent than almost any of them. More than Kerrigan, Oksana Baiul, Michelle Kwan, Nicole Bobek, Peggy Fleming, Dorothy Hamill, Kristi Yamaguchi, {or} Sonja Henie. Harding had it all.""I never heard such words applied to Tonya Harding before this book. I also didn't know before this book that Nancy Kerrigan wasn't well liked.This book clearly shows that talent even unusual talent or skill doesn't compensate for hard work. If Tanya Harding had practiced and stayed in shape, she could have been famous instead of infamous!"
3,An informative look inside the world on the ICE,"I though the book was very informative. It gave alot of ""backstage"" stories, fans never hear or see. However, I felt that the book was VERY one sided. Sometimes it completely ignored the other side of the story, for example when describing the entire Kerrigen/Oksana battle, i felt that she clearly showed that she was on the side of kerrigen, I felt she should have remained in between, a foolish reader would easily be turned to what she wrote, and take it as complete facts, because thats the way I felt she was writing, like it was a fact that kerrigen was better, and that simply is not true. Aside from that I felt the book was strong, I recommend it."
4,An inside look at the world of ice skating,"This is a really good look at the world of figure skating. It gives you a better view of judging and what the skaters go through to become champions. All of the popular American skaters are covered, well as a few up and comers. The book is full of history and gossip. It is a really fast read."
5,A must for all skaters!,"As a figure skater this book was really interesting for me. It brought out all the negative things about skating (the early morning practices, pressure to do well, AIDS, homosexuality, and the extremem competitivness of the sport) and put them out for the world to see. But the book also showed the positive things about skating, showing why people are captivated and why skaters put themselves through the pain and pressure just to skate and be number one. The book gave me a new perspective on the sport that I love and will give up anything to be a part of. I know now about the good and the bad, and that gives me a good perspective, not just focusing on the good or just not on the bad, this book gives what feels like a one-on-one chat with the reader examining this ever perplexing sport."
4,An Entertaining Read,"This book is now dated, figure skating is scored quite differently now, then it was when this book was written. The skaters in the book have long since been replaced by a current crop. Not being an ""insider"", I don't know how the ""politics"" of figure skating have changed, but I'd suspect that the ""politics"" is also at least a bit different from when the book was written.Still, the book is an entertaining read into the world of figured skating in the '90's. The book introduces us to personalities and gives us some background on the famous personalities of that time period. It's interesting to contemplate that today's prominent figure skaters were just starting out when this book was written. In that regard, this book provides an interesting look at how today's prominent skaters were raised in the world of figure skating."
1,A distortion of the truth,"Christine Brennan had the ultimate opportunity to write an inside report of the world of figure skating, but instead she wrote a book full of sensationalistic journalism.Opinions are passed as fact in Brennan's morphed view of figure skating. Unlike Beverley Smith, Brennan did not have much experience in figure skating when she began writing this book, and it shows. Her ""revealing journey"" is one of gossip and stretching the truth.Beverley Smith's ""Talking Figure Skating"" is the best alternative to ""Inside Edge."" Smith respects the sport much more than Brennan, and she is considerably less biased and opinionated.Take everything you read in ""Inside Edge"" with a large dose of salt."
4,She tells it like it is...,"See the starts of Michelle Kwan. Become aware of AIDS and the skating community. Go behind the scenes with Nancy Kerrigan. Learn how the skater's season begins and ends in this fabulous book.Any skating fan will love this book. Brennan writes this book and does not show favortisim to any of the characters as she tell s it like it is.Get a new look at figureskating, and learn what the hype is all about."
2,Prepare to spend lots of time on this for your child,Transformers - big hit since the movie - but they are tough and tedious to transform. Takes an engineering degree. Kids love playing with them but they want them transformed all the time and that is not quality time with the kids.
4,Brawl or Devastator?,"The toy itself is pretty cool. A brutal tank that transforms into a brutal robot named ""Brawl"", or in the movie he calls himself ""Devastator"". Was the movie wrong, or was the box on the toy wrong? Either way, I'm getting a new one since there seems to be a mistake w/ this one. A couple of things that did bother me, the arms are difficult to manipulate and move sometimes. The main chest and upper torso unit actually broke on the toys right shoulder. The side wheels are suppose to flip up and pose as shoulder guards. But the right side actually broke in 5 mins after i took it out of the box. Thankfully, I don't really care much about the toy's robot form. I really like the look and design of the tank. I might design it in 3D!"
5,Informative and Enjoyable!,"Go along with this couple who untie their sailboat and travel fron San Francisco to Baja pulling in at harbors all along the way. Most everything you might encounter is decscribed, discussed and shown via their video camera. Even if this is not your route, it will give you info. on what you will need and encounter while sailing off the coast. I enjoyed all that it offered. Highly recommended!"
3,"Good concept, but frustrating when the game cheats","I've spent many, many hours playing all of the different games in this collection, so obviously it is overwhelmingly addictive. The only drawback I can see is that the game will noticably cheat, particularly in backgammon. If the computer is in a pickle, it will give itself the EXACT rolls it needs. It's actually rather obvious when it happens and I suppose Hoyle did it to make the game more challenging, but it just makes for a poor experience. I'm still playing despite this, so it is an enjoyable game."
5,Hoyle Games 2005,"What a great selection of games! I've owned it for three months and have probably tried about 25% of them. Occasionally I've downloaded a game for a free trial only to discover later I already have it (or a very close approximation) in Hoyle! There are games here for everyone.The only drawback is not being able to save a game in progress when I have to get back to work. Considering the price, this drawback is hardly worth mentioning."
4,Puzzle & Board Games,"Some of the games are very addictive. There are a few nits I want to pick. I would like to be able to access their dictionary that they have set up for the word games. I've never seen some of what they call words. I'd also like to be able to clear the high score tables. You can delete your statistics, but that doesn't clear off the high score tables in any of the games.I like Facemaker, don't particularly care for ""Hoyle Bucks,"" and am very thankful that you can shut off the comments from the computer players. Of the two, I play more of the puzzle games than I do of the board games, but am glad to have both."
5,Ginsberg,"For anyone familiar with Allen Ginsberg's work, this set is a great introduction to his life and times. To someone not familiar with his work, it is an excellent introduction to one of America's great poets, in the tradition of Walt Whitman. To someone who is curious about the ""Beat"" generation, this is a great inroduction to some of the best-known names of that time. Well worth the money, and well worth several viewings."
2,Transformer Review,"I purchased this transformer for my grandson as a Christmas Gift. I was surprised at how small it was when it arrived. In comparison, Transformers sold in the store - the same size sell for 1/2 of what I paid for this transformer. Needless to say, I was a bit disappointed with the purchase."
4,What a cool BAD BOY Transformer!,"The transformer movie, being much better than I expected, caught my son's interest and it has been 24/7 Transformers! Barricade was hard to find so I decided to look on Amazon. It was pricier than the other Transformers at Target etc, for the same size, but no one else had Barricade. The detail is great. I personally love the inscription on the side of the vehicle: ""to imprison and enslave"" right off the movie vehicle! Wish they made a large size Barricade!"
1,Terrible toy,This is the absolute worst toy! It is very small and extremely difficult to transform. It is cheaply made and the plastic pieces are constantly breaking off of it and getting lost. This makes my six-year-old very frustrated.I definitely would NOT recommend this to anyone!
2,cool but not durable,I was really excited when I got this new transformer toy.But like all transformers but in a different way there is more than meets the eye. This transformer looks very cool but it is very hard to transform. The instructions unlike the older ones has only pictures to help you transform it and that does not help at all. The spring loaded punch is very anoying.Every time I touched it went off. It is hard to make it go back into place. You have to get its legs exactly in the right position to transform to a car.It was so hard to transform back to a car that once I got back to a car I kept it that way and did not transform it again.
4,Typical Transformer,"Just like the transformer toys in the 80's. It did not look like the ones on the show. It was ok to play with. I had a hard time locking the legs into place. The legs are permanently bent. I don't know if this is done for balance, but it made the toy awkward to look at. Everything is just out of proportion in robot mode. It was perfect in vehicle mode."
2,Barricade not as good as in the movie!!,"Before anything else I say, I want to make it clear that I love the character Barricade and its many incarnations. I loved him in the movie as he was one of my favorite characters and then him being a Saleen Mustang just boosted that even higher!! Now for the toy all though cool looking in car mode all the detail is there once he turns into robot mode he isnt as impressive. I mean the overall look is there but compared to the other Transformers from the movie line he is probably the simplest looking one. To turn him from car to robot and back again is a very unpleasant task and then the fact that you get a feeling you might break something snapping everything back is unsettling. i personally dont like the spring loaded punch, for one thing it seems like it might break while putting the arm back, and too it looks awkward one its done. So again great character, mediocre toy, but if you absolutely just want to have Barricade for your collection a must buy."
2,liquid leather fix,"Easy to color match with the instructions but I had problems with obtaining the texture. The use of a household iron, textured paper and a metal rubbing tool did not work. And I tried several times. Better off leaving it to the experts."
2,Not for Toddlers,"My 3yr old daughter loves the movie Brother Bear, so I bought the game. It is definitely geared more towards older children age 5 and up. Another drawback is the fact that you have to use the keyboard to maneuver the characters instead of the mouse. Obviously it is very difficult for a 3 year old to understand to push the space bar to jump, the contol button to move sideways, and the directional buttons to move, etc. Also, the game became stuck with 30 minutes of playing with her. I uninstalled the game and then reinstalled it and it got stuck again in the same place."
4,A good mystery book,"Roman Blood is a very good mystery book. Normally I don't like mystery books, but I really enjoyed reading this one. Another good thing about this book is that it does a good job describing ancient Roman life. The book did get a little boring at times. If you don't really like Roman history then you may want to not read this book."
3,Roman mystery,"Roman Blood was a great a mystery book. It really showed the skill investigators of ancient times had to have. I like the twst and turns of this mystery book and facts about the murder of Sextus Roscius were uncovered. I didn't like the elaborate descriptions of the Roman buildings in the area. My favorite characters were Gordanius, Tiro, and Caecilia. Tiro seems to be portrayed as such a real person even though he is a under worked slave of Cicero. Gordanius is very open to any possiblities and very thrifty about his work. Caecilia shows a great a friendship to Sextus Roscius and has a great personality.Branden Huggins"
2,Very boring and prolix,"I could not go further then 50/60 pages. Veryboring for me and I'm a Roman! I would call it ""second hand"" literature, a bad imitation of Robert Harris ""imperium"" whivh on the contrary is a great book. Maybe I have been unlucky but for sure I'm not going to buy an other book of this author despite beiing a lover of the genre."
4,As always a great read,I've read a lot of Steven Saylor and this is just a s good as all of the other books of his I read. Gordianus ... just as entertaing as always
5,Roman Blood is extremely good,"Roman Blood by Steven Saylor was well written and well researched. Saylor was able to blend his fictional writing with factual information in a very interesting way. Being the first book in the Roma Sub Rosa series, this book has led me to start reading the rest of the series. Roman Blood blends action and mystery. Gordianus the finder is a very intriguing character that will make you think more than you think you should. Roman Blood is a great book to sit down and read to. Its entertaining, but also, if you are interested in ancient Rome, it will give great information on everyday life and Roman government. Also, the ending is a doozy."
3,"Okay, but prosy and humorless","The writer creates good characters with interesting feelings and truth to them. The plot is interesting. However, in this book at least, he is entirely too talky. I found myself skimming the endless details of every stone in every street and stopping where I found quotation marks beginning. Too verbose and very fussy. The book could have been done in half the pages and been less irritating. Also, although the other characters can be interesting, the protagonist is himself rather watery and undefined. But my biggest criticism is that the book is totally humorless. Now that won't bother everyone. But it won't do for me."
4,A quick read,"I've been reading a lot of mystery novels lately so I'm rating this one in comparison to others. What it has going for it: historical data, humour, sex (straight and gay), and strong sense of location What it lacks: craft, clever dialogue Still, it's an enjoyable weekend read but don't read it if you have better things to do."
4,Good Read,"I gave A Novel of Ancient Rome four stars instead of five because while it was good it wasn't quite as good as other books of this genre. For a historical novel, it paled in comparison to the Chronicles of the Kings series. As a mystery it fared better. I bought this book because a friend highly recommended it. I wasn't disappointed."
4,A Good Historical Read,Excellent education on Sulla's dictatorship. Saylor really does a good job in making the reader feel like what it might have been like to live in Ancient Rome
3,"Worth reading, but seen better","This book by Saylor has its charm and worth, but it shouldn't be at the top of anyone's reading list. Roman historical fiction are few and far between, so if you like the period, I'd still pick it up. However, if you've read the intense detail and drama of Coleen McCullough's series or the enjoyable twists and turns of Didius Falco's life in Lindsey Davis's series, you may be a tad disappointed. The book is worth reading if you're in between good books, but it's nothing incredible. The mystery is almost a little too obvious at times and the historical ""fact"" is a little hard to take at times. I didn't find myself latched onto Gordianus the way I did to Didius Falco. Read Lindsey Davis's series before this one."
4,Historical novel rooted in true history,"I have read all of Steven Saylor's ancient Rome book series, this one being the first one of the series. These books are probably more accurately described as historical reference books masquerading as novels. The books are chock full of very interesting bits of information on culture, politics and daily lives of ancient Rome. Any novel that incorporates extensive excerpts from Cicero is fine with me. While the books are marketed as mystery books, the mystery aspects of the books are not much more than an afterthought."
4,very good... but confusing without historic background,"I enjoyed this book immensely; however, I had to sit with the book in one hand and my computer mouse in the other to look up where this all took place in history, the government of Rome at the time of the book, etc. As a stand alone detective novel, this book is good. If you study the historical background, it is even better."
4,"A good read, indeed.","This book was impressivly good, and one of the best mysteries I've ever read. Gordianus the Finder, the main character, was well-written and very intresting. Saylor paints such a detailed mental picture of ancient Rome that it seems he was actually writing from the time period. This book is sure to keep you intrigued and guessing until the very last page. Roman Blood is one of the best mysteries I've read in a long time. I highly recomend it to anyone looking for some suspense."
2,"Historical continuity great, however a fair novel","Steven Saylor does a well-informed and colorful job of writing a mystery set in the historical context of ancient Rome, but that's about the only place this book has high merit. Those with good knowledge of Roman history and culture will certainly admire tha, at least. If you're not interested in the great job it does with these details, the plot will probably confuse, bore, or disgust you. The title is appropriate, there's lots of blood; and sex, and danger, and all the grimy aspects of a murder mystery novel. The ending is really good, though, and after making it all the way through the book I ended up glad that I had. Nonetheless, it was not an exceptional book, and in a number of instances, offensive. Unsuitable for young or unsuspecting readers. For those classicals with respect for Cicero, he is done amazing justice considering the standard the rest of the book has."
3,Ehhh,"I'm not completely finished with this book but it's been somewhat of a struggle to get this far. I find myself saying to myself ""it has to get better, just keep reading!"" lol I really hope it does get more interesting. I feel like Steven has laid so much ground work that I can now predict Gordinius' (the main character) moves before he acts them out. But it's definitely not horrible and perhaps someone who has more knowledge of the Roman Empire would better appreciate what I have forced myself to read."
1,Roman Blood,The book was awful. Everytime I started a new page I had to reread the half the other page to know what was going on. Also the things that happened in the book weren't very descriptive in the parts that had a lot of action especially in the begining with the murder. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.
3,"OK book, but political attack in it is offensive","I enjoyed this book, although it is not 5 stars, but I warn potential buyers to chose a different book if they are easily offended. The author puts a gratuitous note in the book referring to the challenge of surviving our modern era because, among other things, Ronald Reagan lives today. The slam against Reagan had nothing to do with the rest of the book and it left me with a sour taste. The author doesn't have to practice tolerance, of course, this being a free country, but those who don't want be insulted for their beliefs when they are just trying to read escapist fiction might want to steer clear of this book."
4,A Great Read---Stephanie Green,"Roman Blood is a wonderful display of Ancient Rome at its finest, and its dirty underside. Steven Saylor sure doesn't shy away from the unappealing aspects of ancient Rome. Instead, he has geniously incorporated all aspects of Roman life, giving the reader an accurate description of the hustle and bustle to be found in the streets of Rome and the exquisite and diverse decorating styles in the homes of the wealthy. Rome is a city shrouded in mystery, as the reader finds when following the paths of Gordianus the Finder as he braves the Roman World to help bring justice to the lawbreakers. Roman Blood is a quick, suspense-filled novel, one that I truly enjoyed. Steven Saylor depicts Rome so well, it seems as if you're really there and the characters are portrayed in such a manner that the reader feels he really knows them. Roman Blood is a wonderful piece of work and I highly recommend it."
4,great encyclopedia of roman life,"""Roman Blood"" is an excellent source of every-day roman life. Although it's a ""detective story"" with investigations, murder, and intrigues, it is full of little details of daily routine, which make this book attractive for anyone, infatuated with mankind"
3,Not to good disks,"The movie itself is good, but the disks is in not so good shape. They are at bit scratched and therefor the movie is sometimes out of focus and the picture jumps."
1,Rip off,"THis is only part one. This is a two part movie, no where does it say that it is just part one. Without the second part it makes no sense."
4,Priestly Abuse,"An excellent movie for those interested in the law enforcement aspects of pederasty as practiced and hidden in the hierarchy of the Church. A good look at reality and is a movie to enlighten those who do not believe that this kind of abuse continues today. Used in my criminal justice course entitled Child Abuse, Investigation and Prevention. A Good teaching vehicle for those who wish to stop this most heinous of crimes."
1,WHAT A MOVIE,"one of the most powerful and disturbing movies i have ever seen. thank god for the canadians. i doubt this could have been made in america. but it was disturbing. i grew to literally hate some of the people in thia movie and had to shake off what i felt when they found it was time to pay the piper. this should be required watching for all straight people. maybe then they would figure out that pediphiles are not gay. there is a vast difference between gay males and pedophiles. anyway, i can not recommend this movie strongly enough. the acting and the group of people who directed and produced this movie were very brave in doing so. this is a taboo subject in the u.s. once again, thanks to the canadians and the european's who DO make this type of movie.gary in az."
4,Dark and Disturbing,"Even though this is a work of fiction, it was inspired by real-life events. The pain and suffering visited upon the young, vulnerable boys will evoke a deep emotional response from anyone with a heart. Not an easy film to watch, but definitely worth watching."
5,john's views,"So well acted by both adults and child-stars, I couldn't believe they were only acting. It was so real and heart-hitting. I didn't know there was a book too, I must read it sometime."
4,Tug my heartstrings just one more time Jill,"Kate has been brought up in an orphanage in Maine, and now finds herself in search of her purpose in life, as well as the family she never had. After answering an ad placed by a Texas rancher she decides to move to Texas and become his wife. There is a glitch in the works when she arrives and the man she has poured her heart out to in the many letters she has written doesn't even know of her existence. Add a wild young boy brought up by the Comanches and life takes an unexpected turn for our Kate. So begins her great adventure to finding true love, and the family she has always dreamed of. This was a great summer romance a light fun read, perfect for the beach. Kelsana 8/06/02"
3,ok story,"This story is ok. I did like the main characters. But after reading one of the authors more current books, I was disappointed to find this one filled with mild foul language and detailed intimate scenes. I'm sorry I bought it. I did skip over reading those parts once I saw the first one. I just don't think those are necessary to the story."
2,Ho Hum,"I am sorry, but I have read this premise time and again. A mail order bride from the Coast of Maine arrives in Texas to find that the Ranger who supposedly placed the ad, in reality did not. He is wounded in a Comanche raid. She ends up taking care of him and his son who was stolen by the Comanche but is rescued and brought home. Only Kate and the cook seem to be able to handle this 8 year old. But love wins out!This is a first read of Landis' writing. I would have enjoyed more historical material. Altho it was a cozy romance, I cannot see giving it a 4 and 5 star review. But then, I just finished a Diana Gabaldon novel and Summer Moon pales by comparison.Hey! I cannot write a fluffy novel like this and get it published!"
2,"Maybe it's just me, but . . .","What a yawn. Plot was predictable, characters mundane, dialogue and writing style adequate but not interesting. I wasn't in love with the hero, heroine, or the kid, but they were okay. The sex was okay, and sort of even married sex, actually. I considered abandoning the book, but it really wasn't annoyingly flawed, so actually I'd put it at 2 1/2 stars if I could. I must choose between 2 and 3, though, and since I'm feeling sort of glass half empty tonight, I'm going with 2.I rate books as follows:***** Fun and meaningful book, or changed/challenged me in a positive way.****Really fun or meaningful; well worth the time.***Pleasantly skimmed the surface; not memorable.**Plodded through.*Abandoned; very flawed."
3,My first western romance..,"I borrowed this book. I had no idea that it would be so good. The woman, led to a strange place on lies. Her heart bleeds at this news, but she works hard anyway. I was pleased to find this book interesting, but not my normal forte. I think that it had too many morals for me. If you like the old west, indians, and rescue efforts, this book it for you! Happy reading."
3,"Great, but overpriced","The idea of a multifunction printer, scaner, fax, etc., is a good idea, but this implementation is cludgy and overpriced. To start, the base model does not include fax capabilities, which you must add later for an additional cost.All in all, the Brother MFC-8820DN is a much better value (around $600) and has everything included."
5,Great Visualizations!,"Lots of ""I am calm"" and ""I am relaxed"" affirmations. Very good selection of ""scripts"" which are short visualizations meant to relax children. This is very mainstream and a great way to introduce children to relaxation. Great emphasis on breathing however, to teach the mechanics of proper breathing, I have coupled this with Indigo Dreams and The Children's Awareness Curriculum. The kids really enjoy relaxing and love talking about the visualizations in Ready Set Relax. Great way to teach children, especially if you are short on time."
5,happy camper,This is extremely easy to understand way to teach children how to relax and gain control of their bodies. I have given it to two kids who have read and practice relaxation exercises.
5,Valuable information for all blackjack players.,"For anyone that plays blackjack at any level, this book is a masterpiece. If you only want to cut your losses without having to invest extra time or thought, or just want a background on the history and game of blackjack, or want to learn what it is the pro's know, this book is for you."
5,read it loved it got me interested in playing 21,The stories are a little dated. The advice is solid. I learned the Basic Strategy in just a few days.
1,It's another scam from a blackjack scam artist,Don't waste your time with this book. Most of it doesn't apply to today's casinos around the world. Plus it requires thousands of hours of practice at home to become proficient.
4,Worth watching,"This movie deserves to be viewed. Boy A was a juvenile when he was convicted of killing a young girl. The film follows his attempts to live a ""normal"" life after his release. In the beginning, the British accents are a bit hard to understand, but the English subtitles helped while my ear became accustomed to the dialect.Boy A is moving, to say the least. The acting is superb. I would have preferred more on the back story--the murder itself--and an update on his Father. I like closure and to have loose ends tied neatly.I have added this movie to an approved list for an education class I teach."
4,Sad but worth it.,"Well done. Well cast. That being said this is not an entertainment movie. It's serious and suspenseful, but gritty and real."
4,Awesome,Needed these for a party ordered on Friday the party was Wednesday night they were here by noon Wednesday... I absolutely love them
1,camo pants,"I order the pants express they were late and not the right size. I needed a large and got a small,"
1,will not,Ever pay these rediculous prices for this mediocre CD at best ther are 2 good songs on here get a grip amazon 70 + dollars ha ha ha ha ha ha good luck with that one Curless was never that good........
4,Almost perfect,"I agree that opening / closing of tailgate triggers SuddenSTOP way too often. Replacement battery will indeed be ideal. I even like how SuddenSTOP dresses up the rear license plate, it makes the plate look sophisticated. This is also way cheaper than the ridiculously-priced yet inertia-activated SafeLIGHT light bulbs ($148 for a pair!), obscene! Check out SigmaAuto.com to see other accessories that convey messages to others and to protect your rear bumper."
4,A Great Read,"Overall, I really enjoyed this book and found it hard to put down. However, I was rather disappointed with the ending! The whole book was a build up to a great battle and when the battle finally came, we didn't any details of the biggest battle; the one between the dragons and the blackness. I wanted to be there with Ailfinn Mapp, Ruddlahan, Varga and Owain to see what happened to them too and was disappointed with what I got.I will be buying the next book, Prince of Time, when it comes out. I really do enjoy the stories Ms. McReynolds has written so far."
3,Overall very good.,"The author's imagination and detail for writing make her books very entertaining but I find her characters lacking and the romance not her best. I thought ""The Blade and the Chalice"" was much better. I do recommend this book it was a good read but I find myself waiting for her next book hoping her style is more like ""The Blade and The Chalice."""
2,Don't Start With This One,I had an extremely difficult time reading DREAM STONE and almost didn't get through it. You probably shouldn't try to read this book if you haven't already read THE CHALICE AND THE BLADE. I had no idea what was going on nine tenths of the time.
3,Muddled & Confused,"A mix of fantasy & romance novels sounds good. & it's been done well ... i've read some.This isnt 1 of them.From the beginning - Druid boy falls for Elf princess - the story is muddy & thick ... hard to read & harder to understand. The author skips from place to place w/o rhyme or reason, & the battles ... if ya can't write 'em, ya shouldn't have 'em in your story. 1 major flawed character is the Troll King, Slott, who's built up into the major Vile Thing of the tale & whose demise is quick, unanticipated & practically off-screen. 1ce the climactic 'battle royale' begins, it's over. Worse are the changes in the Druid boy, again unanticipated & unprepared for. *I've* written better - & i don't write fantasy to sell. For this tripe to get a *hardcover* contract showcases the greed & stupidity of Bantam Books to put out *any*tthing they think might sell. I found this at the local public library .... now i know why.Not recommended."
2,Let's not compare...,"the ""power of Diana Gabaldon's writing"" to this author's...Dream Stone stands on it's own, though it was not to my taste. Diana Gabaldon is in a league of her own...exclusively!"
4,Not just for parents,"This book was instrumental in changing my parenting paradigm, but it's message is not limited to parents. It can speak to anyone who relates to children and teens. The book advocates the value and promise of every child, regardless of that child's exposure to aspects of the environment that we, as a society, have labelled ""risky"". But don't expect a lot of feel-good psycho-babble. This view of child-relating is clear and challenging. The ""at promise perspective"" has given me a renewed hope, not only for my own kids, but for myself, and for those I previously would have viewed as ""hopeless"". This changed outlook has prompted me to react so much more positively to adverse circumstances. It is a concept that just makes sense!"
4,Good Overview,"I enjoyed the personal details of the generals profiled; it tended to give you a better understanding of the men without having to read a full biography on each one. I would have liked to see more of a comparison made with American generals just to better my understanding of the men. I did come away from the book with a positive view of the generals highlighted, they were professional and competent and not a bunch of jack booted Nazi's out killing any innocent they came across. Then again this book dealt with the top of the class, the type that for the most part did not get relegated to camp duty. The most disturbing observation I made was that here was a very strong, intelligent group of people that were lead to ultimate destruction in only a few years - if it could happen there... This book delivers on what it states it will, an overview of so of the men that made the Germany military successful. It is a good first step if you are looking to increase your knowledge of the area."
5,Excellent book,"By focusing on a number of different generals, this book lets you see all the personal and professional conflicts that hid under the German army's apparent uniformity, and, by doing so, it helps you understand one of the great tragedies of the Second World War: how a civilized country marched all the way down to its own destruction. It is perhaps no light reading, but I can think of no single book that will give you a better understanding of the German army's attitude towards the war and towards Hitler."
5,Hitlers Generals,"Great read and perspective! It is a commentary on the broad spectrum and human condition. You gain insight onto how a basically decent person goes along with atrocity to get along in a dictator run society, and how some people's true propensity for doing evil is brought out by a political system that makes it acceptable to perform evil acts on those are deemed societies rejects."
2,Too boring.,"This book could be really good. Yes, it could! There's only one problem. It's boring. While it covers the lives of the generals, such as Witzleben, Stulpnagel, Fritch and Beck in excrutiating detail, it somehow fails to get the repect and interest of the reader. It's too much about the Generals' relationship with each other and Hitler. I think most people would prefer to read of their military achievements.Personally, I could have gotten a better book for $20. That's all."
4,REALLY HEAVY READING,"This is really heavy reading, because the book talks about 26 Generals and Field Marshalls in Hitler's age, but the chapters are each written by a differente historian, which sometimes is confusing and boring. But the general perspective of the book is great and things are alocated inside a good timeline."
2,And.....???,I'm with Paladeen on that one. I was expecting the book to be a little more about acheivements. I think there is a little more to these men than how they interacted with Hitler.
3,Not always trustworthy.,"The tendency to elide the war crimes committed by some of these generals is downright remarkable in a work with pretensions to scholarship. Many of the contribtors resort to hoary myths of Wehrmacht ""honor"" that the war with Russia turned into a sick joke. The book should be used with caution, particularly by those not familiar with the subject."
4,Look at what you can do!,"I purchased this dollhouse because I wanted something that my two girls aged 3 and 4 can play with together. I wanted it to look traditional, and girly. I painted and wallpapered the house to customize it. I also purchaed all the colorful furniture from le toy van, as i do not like the unfinished and modern wood furniture that plan toys offers. I also made sure to get the base for the dollhouse to get the extra rooms and height. It is extremely durable. My girls love it!!! I added photos to the product images above so you can see how it turned out."
3,"Beautiful, but some structural flaws","I love the look of this dollhouse, like the natural wood and little touches like working windows... but the assembly instructions are a real problem. There are a number of parts that need to be put together with a specific orientation, but the instructions don't tell you that anywhere. I had to take the entire thing apart because a hinged wall segment wasn't closing properly, and even after that it didn't fit perfectly. Some of the components felt slightly warped, and there was a small split that needed glueing. The staircase also has a tendency to collapse, but the parts can be held in place with a bit of putty.Overall, I'm still glad we bought it, but we'll have to see how it holds up over time."
4,Good basic book to pickup!,"I used this book way back in 1995 in my last year of Mechanical Engineering. I found this book to be easy to understand, straight forward and helpful. It had alot of good examples and challenging questions at the end of each chapter. I would say that this book is suitable for someone in the industry who wants a good basic review of what they have learned. Definitely not for those higher levels of understanding."
1,Great book horrible copy,"This is wonderful classic text used in Gas Dynamics classes. Well written and easy to follow. I would strongly recommend getting a copy...but not this one. Binding is listed as ""Textbook"" and when referenced says is is even more durable than a hardcover binding. However, upon recieving this book it is not much more than a bunch of photocopies glued together. Doubt it will last very long....spend the extra $ and get a durable copy."
5,Very Good and Fast,I received my book in a very good status and very quickly ( less than 4 days. Thanks.
4,Noodle Soup!,"When ""noodle soup"" comes to mind, I think we all instantly remember the Friends episode of Joey trying out for a commercial with Ross' son Ben. Joey keeps saying ""mmm noodle soup!"" instead of just ""mmm soup!""But lets face it. Joey had it right. NOODLE Soup is the mother of all soups. We would never make it through cold or flu season without it. It is true, we would all be dead without this food staple.The nice thing about this particular grocery item is that it isn't quite so heavy so as to be cost prohibitive to ship. Best to stock up before the winter rush. You might want to keep seven packs in your pantry just in case Little Joey contracts something at pre-school again. These kids and their germs. Sigh. But no need to fear, Noodle Soup is here!"
2,not satisfied,i thought i got a great deal on this item but it turns out i just got what i paid for. if you have curly hair this is not the straightener for you! it takes FOREVER to straighten one piece of hair and it doesn't leave it very smooth either. it takes a really long time to cool down. it is cute though... love the bag it comes with... now i just have to buy a new straightener to put in it!
5,After the riot ... great music!,"That day in Newport after the riot they had great time with fantastic be bop and western swing music. One of the best recordings from Hank Garland actually available, the only one I suppose where you can find together Hank and Chet Atkins, this live session shows also the monster talent of the 17 years old Gary Burton on vibes.The music here is truly uplifting, relaxed, lovely bebop from 1960. It shows clearly what true jazz was all about before the free jazz delirium (which had some great moments, but a lot of bad too). Standards, blues, bebops, expression, fun, good time.For those who want to know more, here is the all stars line up: Hank Garland, Chet Atkins (guitars), Gary Burton (Vibes), Brenton Banks (violin, piano), Floyd Cramer (piano), Bob Moore (bass), Buddy Harman (drums), Boots Randolph (tenor sax). July 4 1960, Newport, Rhode Island.Bear Family music."
5,Be Mine (2009),"All right, this is a romantic comedy, a romance, so it gains points with me, but I have also to be sincere, it's not exactly the best gay romance I have seen. It's quite clear that it's a small budget movie, setting, sound, scenography, photography, all have the hints of a small budget, and sometime I had the feeling that the director wanted to tell me something, but I didn't understand it (the ball on the beach?). And truth be told, it was difficult to link the main characters with college students, they seemed a bit too old for the role. BUT, again, this is a romance, the story of a young boy who wants his first kiss to be special, and there is a wonderful prince charming waiting for him, so, if you want to see, for once, a gay-themed movie without angst, well, this is definitely it."
1,Bored out of my mind!,This movie goes nowhere fast! Twenty-minutes in and I'm bored out of my mind. The soundtrack is awful; the acting is average; the production quality is low-budget and there seems to be a glaring absence of a discernable plot.
2,Not for me,Rather disappointing and contrived. I felt that the acting was mediocre and I certainly would not recommend this movie. How about some heartwarming stories!
4,Good for the money,This is what I expected. I'm happy with the purchase. If I could do it over again I'd probably get something I don't have to worry about rusting fairly easy. This is a good way to get by if you're interested in saving $$.
3,"old edition, not in good conditions","The book arrived on time, but it's an old version. The page numbers are different and it doesn't include some readings. The pages are also folded and written all over."
1,nothing worth reading,"This was the required text for an English Comp class. For the class we were required to read three stories from this book. First of all let me say that I am not a traditional college student. I am a middle aged man working on an Engineering Degree that I should have gotten many years ago. I digress. I say this to point out that my opinions are not those of a 19 yr old college freshman.There is alot of talk about liberal indoctrination of college students. Well here it is.There may be a mainstream story in this book, but I only read about how we should feel sorry for inner city blacks that wind up in prison, one about how mistreated the Palestinians are and one about how latent homosexuality is to blame for violence in the world.To put it mildly I do not recommend this book if you can possibly avoid it...."
4,Good,"Book was just as described by seller.Shipping was ok, could've been faster though.But will buy from seller again."
2,Surprised!,I was surprised to see the love this book had received by previous owners. I think I overestimated the condition it was because it was definately not what I expected. I guess I can't complain because of the affordable price.
2,Not what i expected,"Although it was stated that the book was not new, the book certainly was not in fair condition for the price paid. Chunks of pages fall out constantly."
1,Meaningless Trove of Garbage,"I had to read this monument to nebulosity for Freshman Composition, and I think I can describe the book no better than by quoting it's introduction. It's states [I must quote roughly, as I have gotten rid of the awful thing] ""many of the essays included in this book go against the grain of common sense."" There you have it! Let's rejoice in our ignorance! Yay! Throw out common sense! Throw out this book instead. It's is written and compiled by nutcases and if your teacher assigns it to you, chances are he is a nutcase too."
2,The stories are uninspiring,"This book contains a number of stories written by such notable authors as Paulo Friere. My biggest problem with this book is that it is too left wing for me. A few examples areFriere's overview of the ""banking concept of education"", an essay wit serious marxist overtonesJoh Edgar Wideman's essay on the hardhips that an author has when he visits his younger brother in prison. More of a commentary on prison conditions, as well as the tragedies happening in the inner city.Susan Bordo's esssay on ""hunger as ideology"" and how ads still target womens insecurities about weightIf you're going to write a book such as this one with essays from writers, at least have the decency to make it fictional essays instead of either a left or right wing perspective. My beef is that this book is used extensively by freshman college students and showing them one side of the political spectrum is not fair."
1,Excessive Wordiness,"I was required to purchase this book for an English class. The ""short"" stories in the book are extremely lengthy and wordy. The authors take multiple pages to state what would have been sufficiently written in a short paragraph. This is not my preferred style of reading/writing, however the various authors are accredited. The passages require thought and reflection from the readers, which is good, but I do not find it helpful as a textbook for an English class. We are required to read texts that are wordy, yet expected to write with concise thoughts and statements. I think that a book that modeled the style of writing we as students are expected to utilize would be a better fit. I would not recommend this book to a teacher/professor in search of materials for students unless they wanted their students to write with superfluous and redundant language."
4,Great!,The book came in great condition. It has been very helpful for my class. I am very pleased with it.
4,Not bad for a bunch of old guys!,"This film was one of the few that I saw on the recommendation of my parents, who saw the movie in the theater. I then went to see it a week or so later. My dad told me the truth, as he always does- when it comes to his ratings on movies. I later bought this film on dvd. I've been told that older actors are having a hard time finding work these days. Well, in my opinion, it takes a movie like this one to prove that the old guys still can make a great movie. Hat's off to Clint Eastwood for making a killer movie!"
1,Upsy daisy,Economy of production is one thing but this disc moves into the field of paucity.It beginds with the second part of the show and finishes with first.Not fair to our Clint!
4,A Fun Romp If You Can Go With The Flow.,The movie is fun and reasonably fast-paced; it is also well acted and thoroughly enjoyable if your imagination will stretch just a little.With a leading cast of four seasoned actors doing what they do very well it's unlikely too much could go wrong.The biggest thing required of the viewer is a willingness to accept the basic assumptions of the movie and to believe all of this is possible.If you can do that you're in for an exciting adventure. I recommend it for the family.
4,Old age is the new frontier,"I'd say if you're over 40 this movie has a lot of appeal. Yes, I took my 15-year-old, and he enjoyed it too, but old age is the place we all hopefully get to, and Eastwood and his friends are entertaining in this space action story about profession and life after retirement. Yes, the plot is a bit thin, and the non-stars are 2-dimensional, but humor and attention to detail make up for it. And there's just enough drama, and fast flying, to get your hearbeat going. Careful, though, not too fast!"
2,Implausible Dreck with a Great Cast,"I admit, there's a ton of charm that's inevitable when you put these 4 guys together, and that alone makes the film watchable, but the plot and twists are just insane. Marcia Gay Harden's character falls in love with Tommy Lee Jones out of nowhere (apparently she just digs old guys), and cries uncontrollably when she sees him on The Tonight Show (apparently old guys with Jay Leno make her cry). The ending is unsatisfying. James Garner's character only has throwaway God joke lines, and aside from some fun wiseass comments from Eastwood and Sutherland, it's a waste of everyone's time."
2,Can You Say Armageddon?,"I have to admit, this DVD was better than I anticipated. But, that's not saying too much.I think there's a reason the cover resembles Armageddon. No, it isnt quite the same as Armageddon; however, it is similar. Except, a poor attempt at humor.I expect better from Clint Eastwood. Although, it's what i would epect from James Garner.Is it a bad movie? No. Is it a great movie? Not even close. What Space Cowboys is, is a below average movie, with a few laughs. It is enjoyable to a certain extent. However, that is about it. If there's nothing better on TV, and you're tired of the endless infomercials, that you've seen 30,000 times to many, then, I would recommend this movie.Maybe Im just cynical, and very critical. Afterall, some people enjoyed the movie. I just cant see why."
2,Pointless?,"While the actors in this movie are astounding.....the movie is not. Even though these acting legends have suprised us and pleased us in many movies, they do not live up to their potential in this slow flick. As I sat and watched this movie, the only point that came across to me was that these men thought that they were ""too old"" to do this feet. As I continued to watch I couldn't help myself from saying ""Ok, I get the point, you are too old. Can we get to the movie now?"" While the movie is not intolerable, I don't recommend it."
2,some bright moments in overall flawed effort,"A few times during this movie I was pleasantly surprised. The jokes about the main characters' ages and Donald Sutherland's libido were very good. But, as another reviewer stated, the 2nd 1/2 of the movie really lets you down. For example, I expected more tension and a better follow-up of the question of how a US design ended up on a Soviet satellite in the middle of the Cold War. Unfortunately, they didn't follow up on the issue at all. No questions were answered. Also, there was no sense of an urgent need for self-sacrifice on Tommy Lee Jones's part when he makes his fateful decision. Contrast that, and the entire movie, with the very well done ""Mission to Mars.""This movie may be worth a rental, but not worth purchasing."
2,Great Actors in an Average Movie!,Space Cowboys is a case of an average movie that has extra-ordinary actors. In part I feel that while these actors preformed well that their talent was wasted on the storyline... retired Astronauts reunited one last time for one last mission. I'm glad I saw it on video and did not pay full-price to see it.~FallenMoon
2,So far...but yet so near!?,"Right from the start where the voices didn't quite match the faces of the pilots I was weary. Things got worse. All the way though, I kept thinking the director wasn't up to the job. Compare the gung-honess of Armageddon with this? You can't, there wasn't any gung-honess. All the space action passed by without so much as a triumphant fanfare, or any cheering from mission control. It was just too loose. After and hour and forty-five minutes I grabbed the DVD box to see which director was responsible for ruining what should have been a cracker. Uh-oh, how could I have not known. It was Clint himself. Doh! Oh and after it was over I suddenly realised that I couldn't remember 1 note from the score. There might as well have not been one. Still there were 4 top notch actors to watch! Ho-hum..."
4,Clint Eastwood fan!,"Good movie to spend an afternoon watching.It has an all star cast of some of Hollywood's greatest actors and just is enjoyable to watch. Here is the story, old guys train to go into outer space to fix nasa junk and its funny watching them train and see the old guys in space."
4,Great Audio and Video Quality,"Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who do this.The 2.40:1 video was great. I give it a 9.5 on a 10.0 scale. I didn't see any grain at all, even in the blue sky scenes. Top Gun, Firefox, and the original Star Wars (Star Wars IV, A New Hope) Blu-Rays all had grain in the blue-sky. There was no grain in this movie, and I sit about 7 feet away from a 52"" LCD.This Blu-Ray offered Dolby Digital 5.1 (not Dolby TrueHD or DTS-HD Master Audio), but it was still very good.This is a pretty good movie, that is not boring to watch."
4,One star apiece,"SPACE COWBOYS deserves one star apiece for each of the main attractions, Eastwood, Garner, Sutherland, and Tommy Lee Jones. I can't think of any reason to watch this movie except to watch those over-the-hill seasoned actors ply their trade. The movie is a ""not quite"" film. It is not quite drama, comedy, nor action. In the end it is about heroes and if you liked Eastwood, Garner, Sutherland, and Tommy Lee Jones this is a hero movie that's worth the time."
5,Greatness,I love Clint and this is the best 4 in 1 I've ever received! Great addition to my Clint collection.
5,Great Family Movie,My husband had been wanting this movie so I bought him. He watches with our son and me. We love it!
5,Space Cowboys,"I love this movie, however the disk is HD and will not play on my system. Need to be careful about the formats."
5,Good Actors,"Nice job, I think the stars had fun doing this one. Nothing real special just a fun movie to watch."
4,Great Movie!,"This movie is very entertaining and fasinating. Would it be realistically possible in real life? Probaly not, but who cares...strictly for entertainment."
3,***1/2 out of *****,"One of the most popular films of 2000 is Clint Eastwood's SPACE COWBOYS, a hilarious epic about a group of retired astronauts who are re-assembled to take a decaying Russian satellite out of orbit.First of all, let me say that there was not one time I was bored throughout this film. It maintained by utmost attention from start to end - and why wouldn't it? It has a flawless cast that plays out each of their roles hilariously; another great job by Eastwood as director; an interesting script filled with laughs and questions; and...Do you really need more than that?!I highly recommend you watch SPACE COWBOYS as soon as you can. It's a great combination of fun and fantasy with one of the most perfect casts you'll ever see.OVERALL SCORE: ***1/2 (3.5) out of ***** (5) [Above Average]"
4,Baby Boomer Delight,"Although I'm not a baby boomer, my dad is, and I know he loved this movie. The subsequent generation also respects the likes of Eastwood, Jones, Sutherland & Garner. So, I think this movie is definitely the type of movie for two generations. I just cannot believe it took me 11 years to watch this movie!!! Anyway, the negative reviews that I saw suggested that the movie was slow moving. Well, people that think that wouldn't know a good movie if it bit them on the hiney. It's called good acting people. Some of the best movies of all time are NOT action-packed....they revolve around solid characters and great acting. Even though this movie is full of testosterone (considering the cast), it's filled with tremendous and expected quality acting. If you appreciate that, you'll certainly enjoy this film. Hats off to the super studs in this film....it was exactly as I expected from such a crew of bad a55ses."
3,"Terence, smell my spacesuit...",Space cowboys was dissapointing to me after reading all the hyped up reviews and booring at times.. The movie was presented with events and technology all available today however this made the movie completly unbelievable... to me this is just a rental movie..
2,"uh, no","it had a few funny moments, but really it was pretty stupid and really predictable, great cast, not so great movie..not really a must see...you'll live if you miss it."
1,"Awful with a capital ""A""","I could not believe how pitiful this movie was. It was boooooring, predictable and painful to watch. I like James Gardner, Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, and Donald Sutherland and I do not know what possessed them to do this atrocious movie. By watching this movie I wasted 2 hours of my life that I will never recover - please don't do the same."
1,i think the movie was awful,i saw this movie i didnt like the movie the acting was good but thw polt of the movie was not funny to me i wouldent spend one dime to purchase this movie even watching this movie for me was a great wast of my time
1,"Clint, how could you?","A laughably bad movie, the whole story is unplausible and unbelievable, and not just the sci-fi aspects of it. So many great actors wasting their time here. It's like watching a deleted scenes reel from a good movie. Come to think of it, there are no deleted scenes on the DVD. The extra interview with Jay Leno is telling, he has a hard time disguising his bewilderment with the script.But it's OK for a couple laughs. Maybe a good date movie for the AARP folks. Rent this, but buy Kelly's Heroes or Mystic River instead."
1,Waste of valuable time,"It is obvious people are rating this movie based on the calibre of actors in it.That is why I watched it in the first place, especially because of Tommy Lee.Unfortunately it was a waste of time and I slept off on it.It is just another predictable space movie, nothing more.Shows a loss of ideas and lack of creativity.Nothing exceptional.It is deja vu.Why did they give it that title anyway?"
1,Space Cowboys (HD DVD),I can not review this DVD as I didn't read all the PRODUCT ALERT. I have a Blu-ray player.Mac
3,Not Bad Geriatric Stuff...,"Directed and Starring Clint Eastwood, this 'geriatrics in space tale' involves actors James Garner, Donald Sutherland, Tommy Lee Jones and Eastwood as would-be astronauts launching into space way past their prime. The film is aptly directed due to Eastwood's patience and class. Although not a highly original or edgy film, it does goes well beyond the barriers of a typical Disney-esque movie. The space scenes cinematography/computer graphics are well done and worthy of any good sci-fi picture. Of course, rounding out the cast with the likes of James Cromwell, William Devane and Marcia Gay Harden kinda helps too. Not quite as good as A Perfect World but still fun to watch. *** 1/2 stars."
4,"""The Ripe Stuff""","In this movie Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland, and James Garner are 4 former Air Force pilots who trained to go into outer space but were denied the chance. Forty years later they are called in to NASA to rescue and repair a Russian communications satellite that threatens to crash back to Earth. When they actually reach the satellite they find that they are dealing with something which is a much greater danger. This movie has laughs, suspense, and 4 actors who appear to be having a great time. The plot strains credibility but it's best to suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride!"
4,A terrific flick that will keep you laughing,"When I think of Space Cowboys, I always come back to the opening sequence: it is, hands down, one of the funniest moments in movie history. Not only was everyone in the theatre rolling in the aisles, but my fiance and I still laugh about it, many months later.This is a sweet, funny, serious, and charming film that is sure to delight even the most jaded movie-goer. It's worth a watch, and worth adding to your DVD collection. Enjoy."
3,The 4 movies on this DVD are:,"The 4 movies on this DVD are Space Cowboys, Honkytonk Man, Every Which Way But Loose, and Any Which Way You Can. I wanted to know this, but couldn't find the information listed here ... so now you know!"
2,Great Movies Poor CD,I love the movies and highly recommend these Eastwood flicks. However this version is poorly produced. The CDs are recorded on both sides without labels making almost impossible to handle them with out putting finger prints on one of the recorded movies or to even know which movie is being loaded. In addition there are several dead spots on the movies where the action just freezes up for 5 to 30 seconds and then continues. Try and find better recordings of these movies even if it costs a little more.
3,Space cowboys: worth the rental,"I didn't see this at the theater, but heard it was a good comedy so I checked it out through Amazon Prime. It was an engaging film. When Clint Eastwood isn't talking to chairs, he can be quite funny. And Tommy Lee Jones is a great compliment to Eastwood. Donald Sutherland is a great as well. I would recommend this one."
4,"old geesers have it,still","space is the final fronteer, this is the right stuff meeting geritol! we may be old but silll got it type movie, it has it's moments, good and bad but i like it it.s got action and the whats gonna happen next going for it! i give it 4 stars!"
3,"Good, if Somewhat Stale, Entertainment.","My wife and I have been watching a lot of Clint Eastwood movies on DVD and last night it was ""Space Cowboys."" The movie was somewhat entertaining, but it came out of the era following the end of the Soviet Union and the Cold War and seemed very badly dated. It was sorta like viewing very stale news. It was fiction, of course, but we greatly prefer something like Star Trek for space fiction. In any case, he acting was excellent, if not a bit overdone in places and it was a good cast. The story was interesting, if not somewhat far fetched. The photography was excellent and the Skylab views of the Earth were spectacular and well worth viewing. The movie had a mildly amusing tone to it. All in all, ""Space Cowboys"" provided good, if somewhat stale, entertainment, but I just couldn't rank it along with the better Clint Eastwood films.Gary Peterson"
4,gerotrics in space,"Althow highly inplausable, this movie was alot of fun, it ranks up there with other recent clint eastwood films like absulute power. Check it out, it was alot of fun to rent or buy."
4,What a ride,"While this movie is described as about a group of aging astronauts called back into service, don't believe that cliche totally describes the movie. It's quite funny and serious. The training scenes with the younger astronauts makes this worth owning alone. But more important is the critical plot that develops from what you think is the main plot about 3/4 of the way into the movie. The cast was brilliantly selected and they all contribute in unique ways. This film pays off in the end. Enjoy!"
3,DVD is Missing Promised Extras,"The outside of the Space Cowboys DVD package (and Amazon's description) promises ""4 Behind-the-Scenes Documentaries."" The inside of the package lists them: 1) Back to the Ranch: On Location with the Cast and Crew 2) The Effects: Conversation with Visual Effects Supervisor Michae Owens, et al... 3) Tonight on Leno: Expanded version of the Tonight Show sequence. 4) Up Close with the Editor: Conversation with Joel CoxThe DVD, however contains only two! 3 and 4! No interviews with Clint, no insight on the visual effects!Too bad. The movie is really great, but the promised extras are not all there :( The movie gets 5 stars, but the DVD only gets 3 stars."
5,Cowboys and Camaraderie and Courage,"This film has a great premise and starts out brilliantly and only falters just a bit in the third act. Clint Eastwood, James Garner, Donald Sutherland and Tommy Lee Jones are very good. However, Tommy Lee Jones looks about 15 years too young to be from the same era as the other three. Yet, I felt Jones came off the best and his character truly comes to an endearing end, which makes up for a lot in this film. All considered the camaraderie these four actors have really comes across and saves the day making the film really enjoyable."
4,A More Plausable Take on Space Armageddon,"In 1998 (I think), two space disaster movies were released--Armageddon and Deep Impact. The former was a typical Michael Bay movie. The latter was a similar, but less in-your-face version of what was essentially the same plot, that of a deadly comet heading towards Earth. Each had their good parts, but I would rate Deep Impact as the better of the two. Space Cowboys is similar in that it deals with a deadly threat from space, but from a far more likely source: other people. Probably not in the top 100 best movies, but still worth watching.I'd rate it as a little better than Deep Impact, though they both earn 4 stars."
4,Everyone has to have an opinion,"All I can say is, this is your chance to see these 4 guys in a flick together. Plus, probabaly the last chance to see James Gardner peorid. Decent plot, GREAT effects.. IL&M did an excellent job with the CG work.. probally some of the best yet. So what if it took most of the film to get to space, that was the point. It took THEM 40 years! 4 of the strongest actors of our times, one of the best directors we've had added up to a watchable movie. No, it's not Casablanca or Gone With The Wind.. but good fun all the same!"
2,Dissapointing but quaint.,"Grabs your attention at the start, but then it tapers off and plods. Some cute scenes, mostly regarding the idea of these centenarians getting ready to be shot into space. The finale is muddled, bland, and finally predictable. Somewhat entertaining."
2,Seen it before,"I guess they were capitalizing on John Glenn's sexagenerian ride into space with this good old boy tale of four early test pilots who ride the space shuttle in their 60s. Problem is this seems like it was made from spare parts left over from numerous other movies, from ""The Right Stuff"" to ""Lost in Space."" They all start the same way: in the desert with a test pilot crash from which the hero walks away unscathed. Clint Eastwood and Tommy Lee Jones carry the load here, while Donald Sutherland and James Garner have nothing to do, especially Garner. Eastwood delivers his trademark sneer here at the young whipper-snappers, instead of the bad guy criminals like usual. Totally inoffensive family entertainment, but probably only Grandpa will want to watch this."
5,Great movie for a great price!,My husband loves this movie!!! The price was excellent and so was the condition of the movie!!! Thanks a bunch!
4,A really good box set.,This is a nice set that contains a good selection of some of Clint's best older movies. I am quite happy with it.
1,"Very technically inaccurate, but mildly funny","Well, this film is definitely following suit for technical inaccuracies in movies. NASA wants to repair this ""broken"" Soviet satellite before it burns into the earths atmosphere, and then miraculously launch it back up into Geosynchronous orbit. Ok. First of all, if the satellite was originally in a GEO orbit (22,000nmi above earth) how did it get all the way down here in low earth orbit (~210nmi)?? Second, why would you want to put a military defense satellite with nuclear warheads all the way up in GEO?? Third, how the heck do thy launch it back up to the mmon at the end???? Fourth, .....awww forget it. There are a few funny scenes dealing with Donald Sutherland and some women, but I recommend that you don't even rent this movie."
2,WHAT A BAD MOIVE,"I am a big movie guy and in my life this is the worst movie i have ever seen with my homedog Clint Eastwood. i had just rented this movie on 4/17/01 at 3:37 pm EST. i watch the movie about 2 hours after i had rented it. i was thinking that this would be a great movie because it had some the best actors from back in the day, but i was most deffenitly wrong i watched it and i thought the thing was hours long. a good moive seems liek it is 10 mins long. the space cowboys seemed to be draging be hind a car like a road kill cat hangin from the back of a car. i edvice u to stay away from this movie. but itif u like clint he dose a good job so see it if u r a fan."
1,Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen,"Watching ""Space Cowboys"" was like watching a train wreck happening in slow motion. I only sat through it by a perverse fascination with seeing how bad it could get.Seriously. This is really bad."
1,Only one word can describe this movie - BORING,"The only reason I can think of that other 1-star reviews get such low ""was this review helpful"" ratings is that mostly only people who like the movie read these reviews. Because this was one BAD MOVIE. It was HORRIBLY paced, moving slower than a dead turtle in molasses, then suddenly near the ends it shifts into a totally different pace, and it's almost as if it's a different movie. The last 25 minutes or so relate IN NO WAY to the rest of the movie, and it really makes you wonder ""why the heck didn't I just skip to this part of the movie in the first place?"" But even then, it's horribly done, and very hard to swallow. Not only that, but the characters are very unbelievable as well. And to top it off, the movie is filled with as many Hollywood cliches as possible.This truly is one of the most boring movies I've seen in years, and I'd advise you skip it and watch something more interesting, like the ceiling."
1,Load of fertilizer,"Ok let's theoretically say that a bunch of astronauts get stranded in their space shuttle in space. In real life, they would 1)Play the hero and try to land their busted space shuttle, 2)Ask Nasa to send up another one, to pick 'em up and take 'em down.....oh wait how can I be so silly, Nasa, that deprived, third-world nation space agency only has one space shuttle. Oh then everything makes (non)sense. Avoid this movie like the plague. It's more fun to watch rocks grow. If it it were possible to give this movie a 0 star review I'd do it."
3,Decent,"I should state that I generally read quite a few reviews prior to deciding which book to read next. This has generally proven helpful. At times, as in the case with this story, it has set my expectations to a certain level. The glowing praise that this book received had my expectations set to which I thought I was going to read something special. Unfortunately, I did not find this to be the case. In general I do not prefer a story when the villains are revealed early so that is always a bit of a letdown. The main character is likeable and flawed. The subplots surrounding his personal and professional issues do add to the mix but ultimately it simply became a chase novel. Overall the story moved into much familiar territory so it is hard to give anything other than a lukewarm recommendation."
4,Excellent Thriller...,"This book had all the edge of your seat aspects a great thriller needs. Totally creepy villain and if possible, even creepier accomplice. Suspense slow to build then wham! Extremely well developed, believable characters, especially John Cardinal who is trying to deal with his own personal demons while hunting down a very real one. And I agree with other reviewers - the cold atmosphere was palpable. Highly recommended!"
3,Mixed,"Good & bad. The villains are almost, but not quite, cardboard, & pure evil. Unnecessary descriptions of torture etc for its own sake -- doesn't help the plot one bit. Revealing the villains well before the end reduces the surprise quite a bit; what remains is simply, how will they be caught? Book could be shortened somewhat: eg, the Special Investigations subplots rather dragged. Main characters very well drawn: more interaction in the police station would've helped. A good start. Hope the other books in the series are less gruesome & some of the language is toned down a little."
2,A great disappointment!,"This book hooked me on the first page, with its description of just what winter is like in Algonquin Bay, Ontario, in what even Canadians call ""the North."" John Cardinal is a police detective with a Past and a string of murders of adolescents to solve. His partner is Lise Delorme, six years in Special Investigations (i.e., political cases and what we in the U.S. would call Internal Affairs), whose assignment is to investigate Cardinal, as well as to help solve the murders. So far, so good. Blunt gets you into Cardinal's mind, into the personality of this frozen little town, into the relationship between the local cops and the RCMP . . . and then he blows it completely. One-third of the way into the story, he tells you who the killer is. A serious error on the part of the author. What began as a potentially first-rate murder mystery degenerates into a mediocre thriller. At the two-thirds mark, I gave it up."
1,Police procedural,"O Canada, your Ontario setting was the only good thing in this novel. Everything else was... well, blunt. Come on, Canadians; the stereotype is that you're rather witty - act like it! (D)"
5,WORKS GREAT!,"I've started taking this Lappare multi vitamins few weeks ago and I 've been energized eversince, I've been working like a horse, and I don't have the pain in my legs any more. Thank you Amazon!"
4,Absurd space and time,"This is a kind of play that I cannot say I 'enjoyed' it, or even that I understood the story. But I can definitely say I 'felt' the absurdity of life, things not making sense, the concept of being in an absurd space and time, immobilized, waiting for something, death, end of something. In this regard, it is a brilliant play."
3,What a drag...,"What a drag that the original recording from way back when with Burt Lahr and E.G. Marshall is not available on CD. I haven't heard this one, and it may after all be very good - if someone has actually heard both, please argue with me, but I'm still waiting for a reissue of the one I remember. Burt Lahr was FANTASTIC in his role!"
2,Waiting for Pointot,"Damvlad: It will come.Estrogen: Yes, I know. When it does, we move.Damvlad: Right arm.Estrogen: You mean right on?Damvlad: That's right.Estrogen: On.Damvlad: Arm.Estrogen: But the point!Damvlad: It will come.Estrogen: Perhaps.Damvlad: Yes, perhaps, but why wait?Estrogen: Maybe that's the point.Damvlad: It could be. Either way, we are waiting.Estrogen: True.Damvlad: Lots of people think there's a point.Estrogen: Some don't.Damvlad: Some do, some don't, but either way, we must wait.Estrogen: That doesn't mean there's a point.Damvlad: What other point could there be?Estrogen: Do we even need a point?Damvlad: Some people might.Estrogen: Even if there's no point?Damvlad: Perhaps.Estrogen: Maybe we should go.Damvlad: No, I still think that we should wait.Estrogen: Maybe that's the point.Damvlad: Right arm."
5,Great Album,"Here's an outstanding album by a lady who knows how to sing a honky-tonk song. If you're into Reba, Shania, or Faith, then chances are you'll hate this album.....if you appreciate true country music (complete with steel guitars and fiddles), then buy this one. Leona Williams has been around for quite awhile, beginning with a few duets with her ex-husband/wife beater Merle Haggard and a not so successful (but still great) debut album. But, this album is released by Heart of Texas Records, and it surpasses anything coming out of Nashville today. There is not a bad song in the bunch, and personal favorites include: ""Yes Ma'am..."", ""Youd Be Home By Now"", and ""Arms of a Fool"". There's also a cover of Keith Whitley's ""I Never Go Around Mirrors"" that is comparable to the original. Well worth your money."
3,"Not bad, but not good",The book was completly predictable. There was only one major twist and even that was not shocking.
5,Spellbinding,"If you love fascinating sonic textures, rhythms both catchy and elusive, and a playful yet controlled approach to song structure, there's a good chance you'll love this disc as much as I do. One reviewer calls this ""avant-garde,"" but if that puts you in mind of the formless abandon of, say, Cecil Taylor, or the scronking wildness of Albert Ayler, you won't find that here. Every song has its own vocabulary of sound and rhythm, which Hunter, Previte, and Osby use as a framework for creative exploration--always with a groove holding everything together, sometimes upfront, sometimes subtle. Atmospheric, haunting, fun, pensive, inspiring, original, eminently listenable. If you prefer Charlie Hunter's more mainstream albums, this may not be your cup of tea, but if you were longing for something that was as wonderful as Bill Frisell's most creative work (without sounding a bit like Frisell), I highly recommend it."
2,Na,"This series is okay. It in not one I would watch more than once. Truthfully, it completely lost me when the ghost showed up. Then, it just became stupid."
4,No problems from this set...,I purchased this set about 1.5 years ago from Staples online. Connected the phones and waited for them to charge. I have had no problems with them. The phones are used for hours (+6) at a time and now I need to replace the batteries. I don't think that's unreasonable.WOW I am so surprised you had problems. Mine are still working. I did get water in one handset which is my fault.
3,A good memory of a great Arcade Game,The game is good. The DVD version flat out sucks! The DVD remote was never designed to be a game controller. THe regular version is good. It provides a glipse into the mind of the genious behind this and other great games that where way ahead of their time!
3,OEM Fit and Performance without Protective Coating,"This rotor was a direct replacement for my front rear rotors on my BMW 2005 325iT. It installed like OE, no problems or issues. It is made by Centric, a respected manufacturer owned by Stop Tech, a respected manufacturer of high performance after market brakes.There was nothing fancy about this rotor like slots, holes, or anything else to compromise the integrity of the rotor blank; just beefy iron. However, it also didn't have a protective coating on the hub face, so I expect it to rust eventually. Rusting won't affect usage, performance, or life, but it looks like crud. The online description of the rotor didn't say anything about protective coatings, but I assumed it had it because OE does. I would have given this rotor five stars if it had a protective coating."
3,Great movie but very disappointing quality,"The movie is great but the picture quality is inexcusably bad. The price is also way to hight for a movie of this quality. The VHS version, which I have viewed, is far superior to this. I would've given this movie 5 stars if the quality had been better."
2,For collectors only,"I bought this product merely to add to a DVD collection of Air Disaster flicks.I have to say that despite it beeing described as ""Digitally remastered"" the video quality is very dissapointing. In fact a VHS tape I already own is far superior. The story line is nothing exceptional but nevertheless Telavista ought to be ashamed for such low standards, worthy of boycott"
1,junk,"American Racing wheels are expensive junk. You can expect chrome flaking off and rusting in under a year's use, even if you do not drive in snow or ice (salty conditions), and if you polish them regularly as I did. Good chance it is made in China, which would explain the lack of quality in these wheels."
1,"Third time they send the wrong wheel. It is being returned, again.","We have ordered the correct wheel according to the specs, but they keep sending the wrong wheel. We will be requesting a return slip."
1,No center cap?,why would you sell wheels without center caps. dont buy this wheel or youll be searching forever for a center cap...
3,Good coffee-table reading,"Interesting ,particularly the chapters about his beginnings. I also liked the song by song analysis which puts a new perspective on some songs.However,the author never mentions the numerous single-only/bonus tracks,which is a shame as many of them are easily as good as the album tracks (So lovely is the night,partly sung in Japanese is a gem among others)There are also some factual mistakes,Link Wray's Rumble is credited to Duane Eddy and Only the lonely by Sinatra is NOT the Orbison song.A list of the covers played live over the past 20 years would have been welcome as well.So,a very good introduction to Chris Isaak's world and music but a bit light for the long-time fan."
1,Please Listen to BajaBabe's review!!!,BajaBabe knows it all about Chris..Please listen to her review! Trust me! :) She know's it all about Chris!Amy in CTPS: Hi BB! Your review was great!
5,Purpose,"I read this book in about two hours. I couldn't put it down until I finished. What a revelation, an awakening and a revelation. This book has shown me that the things that I'm enduring at this time is simply there because God has put it before me and I will be certain to carry out what He needs me to do."
5,"Fast, Smart, and Original","I got this LP at a DIY show in Athens, GA and have consistently listened to it on a weekly basis since. The sound alternates between thrashy and poppy but not a single song dissapoints. The instrumentation is tight and the lyrics are intelligent and often nicely screamy. Fans of anarcho, folk-punk, and DIY pop punk should enjoy this record thoroughly."
1,Don't confuse this band with the original Drunken Boat,They were making music a long time before this outfit.
1,Product Discontinued by Garmin 2 Years Ago,"Before you buy any Garmin maps for your GPS unit on Amazon, I suggest that you check the Garmin site for the latest version. Amazon has many outdated versions of Garmin software for sale, including this one, which was discontinued by Garmin over 2 years ago."
1,I love the deftones but this album sucks,"First thing: I love the deftones i think that they are the greatest band on earth i have all their cd's and i just downloaded the new song Back to School and it's awesome but this record sucks it's to produced when you listen to it you think that they're in a studio instead of a club chino's voices is the only thing that you listen the guitar,bass and drums sound so far away there's no power,violence in the songs i have some bootlegs concerts of deftones that sound a lot better than this there's no raw in this record,don't buy it listen to it first"
1,don't buy it!!!,"I am a big fan of deftones and i've seen them a couple of times live in London and paris , the live version is far from being a good cd, actually it is the worst live ever made (sorry chino ), i wouldn't recommend it to anybody.....I am looking forward to a real live performance!!!"
1,white pony is better,"when this came out in 1998 i was excited to get it, but the follow up to live, white pony was way better. the songs to white pony are real soft and mellow and they really sound good. live has some ok songs on it but it doesn't stand up to white pony. if you want some live deftones songs get live. if you want some new studio deftones songs get white pony."
1,Less for more,"This is the exact same thing as the Live album, only five dollers more, and without My Own Summer. The live tracks are good, but why spend five dollars more?"
5,Great Live Album,This is probably the best live album I've ever heard. It shows that the Deftones really care about there fans. What I mean by that is that they really interact with their fans during their shows. This is really expressed when Chino stops in the middle of Bored to help a kid find his shoe that he lost and then he lets the kid do a stage dive. This is just another great album to add to my always growing Deftones collection and every album is well worth the money because the Deftones are the best. You must buy this live album now!!!
2,Enh,"I bought the game and played it once or twice ... I did not enjoy it at all. However, I am also not a first person shooter gamer. I gave this game away since buying it because it was just collecting dust on my shelves."
1,Hahahahahahahah,"I'll try to explain everything that was wrong with this game. First off, when you are watching in game cinematic's there will be horribly long and akward pauses. At first I wasn't sure if I was supposed to press a button or what, but I soon realized that it was just bad editing. Second, when you are in hand-to-hand combat(meele) mode, and want to switch to running to some door somewhere in the level, Neo will walk with his gaurd up at about half the speed. Third, I could swear that all it ever gave me was the ""Y+B""....""B""...""\/ Y"" Combo. Fourth, I cannot even begin to critique the camera angles in this game, geesh...Well, I guess if you enjoy fighting giant ants with a torch and hitting the ""Y"" button about ten-thousand times, this is the game for you.PS: I give the W-Brothers a big ""WTF?"" for that last level. Ten whole minutes of ACTION PACKED, dodge, hit.... And you can't even pick where you want to hit the Smith'o bot, it's all just one boring movie... Yawn..."
2,GIVE ME A BREAK,"how can anyone say that this game is the game of the year??? for sure they havent play resident evil 4.this game is very very bad, the camera is imposible the graphics could be much much better and the controls are just horrible DONT BUT THIS GAME rent it first if you want to play the game of the year buy resident evil 4.RENT IT FIRST."
5,Whoa...,"This is the game ""Enter the Matrix"" had wet dreams about. Fluid control, a deceptively deep combat system, and more jaw dropping fight scenes than you can shake a 9mm at. The gun combat could be a little more finely tuned, but it works. Though who would want to use a gun when you can run across a wall, jump off and spear someone to the floor, pick them up by their legs, swing them around in circles, and launch them at a group of their homies? Because you can do that."
5,Why didn't anyone tell me about all that before?,"This book is one of the rare ""ha"" books out there! No stupid little behavioral reciepes like ""look at yourself in the mirror and tell yourself how much yourself"". Yet very clearly explained observations about how one grows up to fit in a family pattern and to reproduce it in adult life.And John Cleese's humour makes it fun to read... Definitely a keeper for anyone not happy with their life and actively trying to change for the better..."
4,Ignore the flaws and grab hold of the gems of insight in this one!,"This isn't a stereotypical self-help type of book and that makes it THE book that could save your marriage and/or the way you relate to your children.One warning - much of this book goes against the common wisdom of the day and the authors don't propose that parents mollycoddle their children. The focus is on teaching people to live in the real (NOT ideal) world and to learn to deal with it, to develop some backbone and realistic expectations.In short, this is a book which will keep you from seeing yourself as a victim and teach you to accept the inevitable unfairness in life - and to help your children develop similar strengths."
1,pitiful,do not waste your time. i don't know the point of this book but it is not to teach the reader anything about the art of rugmaking!
2,Geezers Meet Aliens,"When Foster's novels are good, they're very good. When they're bad, they're horrid. Codgerspace is beyond bad. Foster tries to be funny in the vein of Douglas Adams, but humorous science fiction is among the most difficult arts, and here, he really muffs it up"
2,Stairway to nowhere,"The premise was pretty good, but it quickly went downhill from there. A couple of original thoughts in a cookie cutter novel. Foster has done much better. You get the feeling that he wrote this novel for no other reason than to fulfill a contract. It's an ok read, but don't lose any sleep if you miss it."
4,I hated looking at amber bulbs.....,"These are great if you have clear light housings and hate the look of an amber colored bulb in there!! I'm a car guy and it seems trivial, but this detail really makes an impact. The only downside is the price."
3,"A sweet, sad record","Most people would describe this record as absolutely unlistenable, but it has a genuine, innocent spirit. They made their music in a home studio using everyday objects and tape manipulation, and the results are incredibly bizarre. Nevertheless, I think these guys are ripe for rediscovery. This is music that does not yet have a category; it could be the foundation of a new genre."
4,Great For Convenience Food,These are great and economical for convenience food. While you won't mistake this for fare from a fine Indian restaurant this makes a nice change from cold cuts and instant soup. This comes out of the microwave just fine and isn't overly complicated like some microwave meals. It's also more filling than it looks.
1,disappointed,I found a mistake right away.The book credits JFK for saying: ask not what your country. . .etc.Actually Gen. Bradley said it to the troops long before JFK ran for president.And before Bradley said it - Kahlil Gibran wrote it in his book!But it was fun to read.
3,"It's Good, but not perfect","Given the fact that this book was written in 1974, it is ""Good, but not Perfect."" Another fact is that, in my personal knowledge and research, I don't know everything. So, it is excellent as a ""Bathroom Accessory"" and makes the downtime enlightening. I recommend this book as a supplement to one's ""formal"" education."
3,good but not exciting,some good information but definately out-dated and some of the entries are too long with bland information.
1,Not up to the Reviews,"I bought this book based on the review in People Magazine, which just raved about this book. I found it hard to read, a VERY slow read. I found myself making me finish this book. Was reviewed to be 'hilarious', and I found it to be boring and 'longwinded' I wouldn't choose to buy this book again."
2,"Depressing, predictable, and boring","I picked this up because I love to write. It started strong but went downhill from there. The only parts I enjoyed were the trials and travails of writers, which seemed accurate enough, but what do I know? The plot was too predictable at times. I didn't feel any compassion for any of the characters, mostly because I didn't feel like I knew them well enough."
4,Engrossing Page Turning Dramady,From the introduction on through this book keeps your attention. A great story of comedy with heartfelt drama and sadness. A mix of a little of everyhing. Great potential for a movie.
4,Lit lite (but tasty!),"For the first few pages, I thought this was going to be another one of those annoying, angst-filled novels about some over-educated hipster. However, ""Lit Life"" surprised me by being a little more insightful and poignant than I originally perceived. Surprising too, was the ending, which I expected to be far more pat.This is a breezy little novel that took me a few short hours to read, but I did read it pretty much straight through because I found it quite engaging. The main characters are full and well-developed, and their respective plights absorbing. I particularly enjoyed the insiders' view of the publishing industry--it appears to be a scary place, one that I will not likely visit during my lifetime as a struggling writer."
3,lite reading,I liked it and so will all thosewho are entertained by the anticsof writers in their private lives
5,A great beach read with some real literary guts!,"Kurt Wenzel's debut novel is a smashing success. Where is all the buzz? So much is written and spoken about lesser works with this one book having some real moxie. It is both an easy read and an expose on writers and writing. Wenzel makes you laugh and cry about the whole publishing world. The struggle is over writing the Great Novel versus something that can put food on your table (or booze in your belly!) His characters allow him great lattitude in terms of plot but it is essentially their personas on which the novel is predicated. Comparisons are sure to follow (and curse) this budding author. Wolfe, McInerney, Ellis, even a less sophisticated Fitzgerald. Lets just allow Wenzel to be Wenzel and just hope that he keeps on writing, however irreverently!"
1,Fred Toucher approves but the rest of the world does not!,"Absolute cinematic torture, this disgrace of a film is a vanity project gone berserk for someone who doesn't have any reason to be vain, Steve Barnes. A ""radio personality"" in Atlanta, Barnes is as inept and wooden an actor as you will likely ever see. His performance makes The Rock look like Marlon Brando. There is a reason he has been on radio for his entire life.Completing the cast that includes Barnes are Corey Feldman and Michael Damian, which makes one wonder if a monkey produced this film. What is going on in Hollywood these days?Anyways, the plot is horrible, the acting is horrible, the lighting is horrible, the cinematography is horrible, and the directing is a joke. You are better off watching grass grow."
1,Steve Barnes may be the worst actor of all time!!!!,"This movie is full of bad acting, bad writing, bad lighting, and bad directing. This being said, the absolute worst part of this ""steaming pile"" is it's star and lead ""actor"", Steve Barnes. This has got to be a joke. Did he win some sort of ""So You Think You Can Act"" reality show? It looks like they grabbed some big headed, pot marked nincompoop off the street, dressed him in a leather duster and said ""Action""! He comes off as some sort of fat, dopey Clint Eastwood with a lobotomy. Honestly, Steve Barnes makes Corey Feldman look like Russell Crow. Just terrible!!"
1,Please go back to Radio!,"I am a Barnes fan from his early morning radio show days.. All I can say is that when people try to do a cross-over from one medium to the next they should really rethink doing it in low-budget.. The movie IS however quite entertaining from Corey Feldmans performance.. I said entertaining, not worth buying.. Rent this if your 99x morning show fan/Steve Barnes fan/or a Corey Feldman fan.. As for the young & the restless star it was an eye-opener on how old I really am because I thought he had died!!! (...) for some funny t-shirts that will make you laugh harder than this movie!!!"
1,"Barnes is the greatest tennis player ever, ...even if he has back acne","Steve barnes performance was incredible. If you traded his guns for a tennis racket the movie would still rock. The only thing this movie is missing is Freddy T, FK and more shots of Barnes back acne. Barnes will always be my hero and I want to give him the grumpyfish."
5,Excellent Service,This item was exactly as described; it was received in excellent shape and in a very timely manner. I would buy again from this seller without hesitation.
2,A little slow,"The ideas presented were very nice, but I felt this book moved a little slow and was, at times, very repetitive."
5,Excellent book,"Since 1998, I have given 35 copies of A Grace Disguised to grieving friends and family. Their responses have been overwhelmingly positive. Dr. Sittser honestly presents his experiences with true grace. His book is a classic."
2,Recipes not temporally correct,"Inspired by the collections in the British Museum (you might have guessed that from the title), this book contains recipes ""to recreate a flavour of what fashionable ancient Greek society in Athens, Anglo-Saxon peasants in their villages... or late medieval Frenchmen might have eaten.""Unfortunately, since there are no known original recipes from the Aztecs, for example, the author has neglected to give any source material. In the ""Classical Greece"" section tomatoes and potatoes are specifically excluded [good] but an ""Ancient Egypt"" recipe calls for coffee [very bad]. I wouldn't use this as a reliable source when so many better-documented books are out there."
1,Don't bother buying this book!,"The first part of the book has good information on currency, local customs, etc. However, the rest of the book is organized ALPHABETICALLY by the name of the city, not by region! If you want to visit Fort Williams and Spean Bridge (which are about 20 miles apart), you have to look under the F's and under the S's (over 100 pages apart) to find information about these two towns, rather than being able to turn a page or two, as the Frommer's or Eyewitness guides permit. Not user friendly at all. An alphabetical listing of cities/towns can be presented in the index, where it is easily referenced. The body of a good travel book is organized by region.Needless to say, I didn't even bother to pack the book when I went on my trip."
4,I Agree!,I completly agree with the other man! this is one of the greatest superman comics! It should be read by everyone. Great gift for yourself or someone you know.(Also tells the final end to Superman!)
3,"Not the same as Original ""How to Find God, Living Water",I also purchased this later edition but did not find it to be as thorough as the first edition. Like the original much better.
4,Life in the South,A tragic read of life in the south. The trials and tribulations of day to day life.
1,Ran 4 Minutes Then Died,"I was more than disappointed in dealing with UnbeatableSale because they said it would take 4-7 days to recieve my slicer and it took 20 days to deliver it. Then the very first time I used the product there was a strong electrical smell...thinking it was normal when many appliances are first used, I ran the slicer for the first time. It ran 4 minutes, then the motor burned out. I was given a refund for the purchase price, but lost over $35. in shipping charges over this fiasco. The lesson for me served as a reminder to always shop in a real store and only use mail order as an absolute last resort. MSB"
1,lousy product,"The first Deni slicer ran about 10 min and then striped a plastic gear and then the blade stopped I called the mfg and was told to ship it back 15.00 shipping they sent me a new one,i started slicing some beef for Phillie steaks when the same gear stripped lousy plastic gear on this machine,it's on the way to the junk pile as i won' pay to ship it back again, I will spend a little more money and get a good machine,"
1,not worth the counter space,"I bought this based on the positive reviews and am terribly disapointed with this thing. I tried to slice a round roast with less than stellar results. The manual stated you need to shut this thing down after 10 minutes to let it cool off..Come-on..whats the deal..this thing cant run 10 lousy minutes?? Well, no, it cant. It got real hot and ran lousy. It seemed to have very little power. On the plus side, it is easy to clean up and the blade adjustment is nice. This might be good for slicing up a tomato for your sandwich, but for anything more demanding stick with your basic knife, it's just not worh the space it takes up."
5,One of my Favorite Books,"A captivating look at New York City and the characters that made it what it was during the art boom of the 1980's this book was enjoyable, insightful, and knowledgeable. It read very quickly, and when I was finished, I wanted to pick it up and read it all over again."
1,A waste of precious trees,"I was so disappointed in this book, especially after reading so many wonderful things about it in every magazine that reviewed it. Fortunately, I waited until it ended up in the remainder bin, and only paid $7 for it. The characters are shallow and one-dimensional, and the writing is so overwrought and pretentious; I found it painful to read. Ms. Eberstadt has no understanding of what it is to be an artist. She writes from the viewpoint of a rich society girl. I couldn't get through the book; I stopped halfway through in disgust."
1,Privileged and precious,"Amazing how delicately Eberstadt poses her vapid insights and observations, passing them off as high art when it is so painfully obvious she and her prose are the products of the Upper East Side, wealth, and publishing connections. This is rarified, elitist, and thoroughly contemptuous. Awful in what it represents."
4,Gibran at Candlenight,"He is that solitary figure who arrays himself in simplicity, dines on grace, sits with nature learning to innovate, & keeps vigil in the quiet of the night, awaiting the descent of the spirit, to transcribe the voices of the wise and deceased, and the whisper within himself. Here is Gibran, the prophet."
3,No combs?,"I thought the book provided some very useful information, and some that had little relevance. The detail on stock fitting was confusing, and gave me no hint of where I might find a stock fitter. But, when discussing stocks, the author says nothing about adjustable combs, which is seen at many trap ranges. Perhaps it was because in Great Britain they do not like adjustable combs."
3,Very Detailed and Techical,"This book reminds me of many golf instruction books I've read. Everything from feet placement to head and eye movement. There is indepth discussion of equipment, fittings, birds, etc. I've found myself consulting it for definitive answers, but found it abit of burden in practical application while on the range. Way too much advice to implement, maybe better to work one piece of advice at a time."
5,Breaking clays,"Very helpfull. lots of good info. easy to read, good illustrations A good book to have for anyone interested in the sport. This book has it all."
3,Mostly benefit a beginner,The author claims he shoots in the mid 80's out of 100. I am already at this level so I was disappointed. This book is more of a general overview of the clay pigeon shooting sports.
5,Death of an Evangelista,Another great book! I so enjoy her writing. I read a great deal and look for ones with a content to keep me into the story. I was once again rewarded with a mystery and people who keep me interested.
5,A good traditional mystery,"This is the 3rd book in this series and I enjoyed the first two as well as this one. I've never been to TX or Mexico but these novels make me feel like I have. This book has an involved plot that is eventually all connected and sorted out. The reader is not left with any loose ends. The characters are interesting and charming. Texana's husband is a vet, so there are even interesting animal characters. I particularly enjoy Phoebe, their pet bobcat who lives in the trading post with them. While some horrible things happen, we are not given such graphic details as to give nightmares. Simply, a nice old-fashioned mystery to wile away an evening."
4,Good game but too short.,Gun is an awsome game. But I was dissopointed that this game was to short because it only took me 4 days to beat this game. That is the only con about this game but there is a lot more pros. Wich are good voice overs in the game the graphics in the game are not great but they are kinda good and the best thing about this game is that there is a lot of violence in this game! This game is good you should buy it.
4,GUN,GUN is an awesome game where you play as acowboy in the 'wild west'. You can shoot indiansand other cowboys. This game is really good exceptfor the fact that it is very hard and is betterplayed by a skilled gamer.
4,Good overall,One of the few decent Westerns out their for any system. Be careful if you get this for kids as it is rated M for a reason (as I found out while my son played it) I would give it 5 stars but compared to what is out their now Red Dead Redemption and Juarez its hard to give it *****
5,Cover deceiving,"Did not think I would like the game when I saw the cover, but it's a lot of fun. Brings the wild west feeling back again."
4,GREAT (but short) game,"Gun is a very fun and enjoyable game, however, you can beat it in hard mode in about 12 hours. I tried it on insane mode and I still beat it quite easily and I've only had my GameCube for a few months. Aside from that the game play is fantastic! I never thought third person shooters could be better Metal Arms, but I was wrong. Like Metal Arms you move the icon around with the C anolog stick. No matter how fun it is this game is very mature so keep this away from the kids. There's scalping, killing, whoreing, cursing, and cruelity.As the title claims guns are the key to this game's enjoyment, there's rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, six shooters, and blend all of the above with a huge area to roam in(I dont care what the other reviews say sure there's only 2 cities but there's still plains, badlands, montains, and caves to explore, taking Not 5 minutes to explore but over an hour!) anyway the point is dont rent, buy and enjoy te west."
4,Short but worth it,This game is preety short but thats the only bad thing about it. The gameplay in this makes up for it. Plus once you've finished all the objectives and the story mode you can go around and cause Showdowns in the local towns.
5,GUN is number one.,"I just rented this game. Went through a couple of levels and I like it. Its like a western Grand Theft auto (except not as much criminal element and you ride horses). You do the main missions to continue through the game. Lots of side missions such as bounties, pony express runs, and other odd jobs around the western towns. Nice variety of old guns for shooting and a variety of other weapons such as axes for close (and no gun) combat. If you get a chance to play it, do."
4,great for the price,"I bought this game awhile ago so I dont remember how it shipped,I think it went fairly fast.It is about a guy named cole and when his boat is attacked by hostiles(indian/union soldiers)and his father is killed(or at least he thought he was his dad)he goes to get revenge and recover the truth.As you progress in the game you will recover more about his backstory.There are quite a few levels and they range from storming a city to sneaking into a fort.It is rated M mostly because of the massive amounts of blood.There are quite a few weapons and bosses are challenging.It is definately worth the price and i recomend it.Oh,the only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because of this level near the end of the game where you fight this boss and if you dont shoot him extremely quickly(he is on horse back) he regains his health."
5,A great educational book,"This book is a ""must have"" for those in the aeronautics field. It is well-written, comprehensive, and accessible. Mr. Hodgkinson uses a great deal of research and diagrams to support the information in the book. It was an invaluable tool in helping me better understand the relationship between the pilot and the plane."
2,Pretty basic for golf specific!,"I'm a Pilates instructor who has recently had a few clients who play alot of golf. I thought it would be a good idea to learn some ""golf specific"" exercises which I could incorporate into their Pilates routines. I ordered this video and found it do be not very different from a basic Pilates reformer workout. There was one exercise that I found to be ""golf specific"", all of the others you would already be doing with your clients if you follow a basic reformer routine. Wouldn't recommend this if you're looking for something a little differnt!"
2,Golf Warm-up on the Reformer,I recently purchased a Stott Reformer and was excited to receive and try this DVD. It was disappointing in that it was more of a warm-up as opposed to a workout. The other golf conditioning workouts (not requiring a reformer) were much more enjoyable and applicable to improving the golf swing.
2,KINDLE VERSION ONLY - Missing a page,"Hopefully they will fix it soon, but I just thought I would let anyone thinking about buying the Kindle version that it is missing an entire page. Apparently they forgot to scan it, and didn't even notice that the footnotes skipped a few numbers. I'm only about 30 pages into the book, so I can't report on any other issues yet.As to the book itself, it's been great so far, but I thought it would be good to let people know about this."
2,Errors in Kindle Version,"There are numerous sloppy errors in the Kindle edition. While reading Section 3 (which is pages 47-91 or so in the printed version, but pages 47-76 in the Kindle version, which makes me wonder if sections are missing) I came upon numerous mistakes. Lines are broken in the middle of sentences, spaces are placed inappropriately (l i k e t h i s) and in one case 2 or 3 sentences had been moved and placed a paragraph later than they should have been. I also found words that were spelled incorrectly (like 'hab' instead of 'had'). Bad form! If I handed in a paper like this for my grad classes I would have been docked quite a bit!"
5,Excellent reference for the beiginning bodybuilder.,"This book is one of the best out there on bodybuilding. If you want to get in shape, the guidelines in this book give you a precise program to follow. This book isn't just for beiginners but is also for intermediate and advanced bodybulders. Programs are giving for all stages of bodybuilding. The charts provided are nice because you can take them along to the gym and they show you which exercises to perform on what day. Bodybuilding history and nutrition are also nicely covered in this book."
3,Good acting but way too slow and drawn out.,From a history perspective I found the story to be interesting. From a theatrical viewpoint I found the acting to be good but the directing left a lot to be desired. History some might argue can sometimes be boring while telling the true story line. Regardless this movie moved entirly too slow for my taste.
1,Bad morale,"This film did not favorably portray the IDF. The soldiers had terrible morale and ineffective/cowardly leaders. Bad acting, bad script, bad, hmm, well bad everything."
5,Inspiring!,This book was full of revolutionary ideas on America's role in the future regarding its military and how it could work in the real world. It is about strategic and revolutionary thinking about developing disparate countries for the sake of benefiting ourselves and the rest of the world. It is truly a fascinating read.
3,Slightly warmed over neo-conservatism,"Tom Barnett's militancy is questionably-suited for a world the US once led because of the appeal of its ideals and culture rather than the coercive dominance of its military. Barnett's realization that the US needs to learn to ""win the peace"", however is a grand idea. The solution lies not in the neo-conservative inclination to military hegemony, but rather in Nye's emphasis on ""soft-power"". It seems that no American neo-conservative can really ""win the peace"" as the movement has been corrupted by association with self-serving motives, disingenuous, and a distaste for real dialogue and exchange of social and political ideas."
4,Barnett's Transformation is Compelling,"Barnett's prior book, The_Pentagon's_New_Map, presented a new explanation for the role of US military in the next decade or two. The book has raised controversies, not the least being ""How can we get there?"". In this book Barnett outlines the process for developing an international core consensus for a plan of action to handle unruly states and unruly non-state organizations. He shows how the US can make realistic arrangements with China and India to make them security allies in Asia, to deal with Asian problems like North Korea and deflate the sails of terrorist organizations. He calls for significant transformation in Blueprint_for_Action:_A_Future_Worth_Creating, but in return he points out how real ""peace dividends"" can be obtained. You won't agree with this book if your future rests on a large US military that tours the world on ever more powerful ships, planes, and tanks blowing up all who oppose our world view."
2,An interesting but dangerous idea,"In this book, Barnett is proposing a system of utopian collective imperialism - a system under which the developed world would cooperate to impose order on the non-developed world. Both to prevent trouble and for the recipient's/victims' own good.Leaving ethical issues of imperium aside, there is a serious question as to the viability of this plan. Barnett is very willing to sacrifice conventional warfighting abilities in order to support his imperial forces. This might work - but only if the rest of the developed world goes along with it. A dubious proposition at best.I'd recommend reading this book - but only to be able to refute the arguments."
4,Some of Sanborn's best!,"After owning the LP, then cassette, I finally bought this on CD. This is some great music from great musicians: Sanborn, Marcus Miller, Steve Gadd, Hiram Bullock, et al.Bad news first: ""Wake Me When It Over"" has not aged well. This one song is the only dated music on the record, however. Also, at a total playing time of 29:45, you're not exactly getting the most bang for your buck.Now the good news: ""All I Need is You"" could be the steamiest, sexist, smoothest piece of music ever recorded. EVER! This track alone is worth the price of the CD.I'll program my CD player to skip track 3 and listen to these smooth tones often. I would love to give this five stars, but with 50 minutes of room left on the CD, maybe they should have put As We Speak on the same CD for a world-class 2-for-1 (...)"
3,Fresh,"In ""Voyeur"", Sanborn joins forces with Steve Gadd on Drums and Marcus miller on Bass, delivering a relaxing and funky R&B; Jazz album.Although short, this is in general a nice fresh album, not overly memorable but quite pleasing.Recommended mainly for all Sanborn's fans.If you like this artist, or looking for his best album so far; check out ""Pearl""; you will not regret it."
5,Classic,"This was my introduction to David Sanborn's music and I've been hooked ever since. ""All I Need Is You"" is the most evocative love song you'll ever hear."
4,Great alternative to $400 sets,I bought this set 1 year ago and am still really happy. I needed some new pans since the set I was using we received as a wedding present several years ago and they were worn out. I didn't have $400 for the set I wanted and purchased these in a Friday sale for $49.99. It was great! I really like the design and how well they have held up. If I see them on sale again I will be getting a set for my new sister in law so she stops trying to steal mine!
2,Not great quality,"I know a lot of the other reviews are pretty positive on these, but either reference price or are relatively new reviews. I have a similar set from Cook's and I have to say the finish is not very good. My most used pan already has a finish that is failing (after about 9 months) and the other pans that I use I can see are starting to be worn. Honestly, I had a cheaper T-Fal set after my wedding and they held up better, longer.If these were more expensive, I would have given it a lower rating, but the price of these are low enough that I should not expect premium quality. Just know what you are getting - these are decent pans, but will not last for you."
3,Degrassi Starlet,"this CD is alright, the songs are pretty catchy and she has talent. I agree with the others though, it sounds really rough like a demo tape. Also, like most actors who try to become singers, this isn't amazing, she's great in Degrassi: TNG, not so great in this CD, if you are a fan of Cassie or Degrassi then i definitely recommend this for you =D"
2,Whatever it takes?,"Please make it stop!Cassie Steele is a beautiful and talented Canadian actress, on the series Degrassi:the next generation.As ""Manny"" she makes us question her choices and root for her, even as we know she is heading in the wrong direction, once again.As I said, she is a talented actress. As a singer, not so, however, if you are a Degrassi fan or a Cassie fan, I would get the cd, if only for the collectible value.10 years from now, she won't be singing."
4,"Great Album, Cheap Pictures","This album was great, hands down. I loved Cassie as Mannie in Degrasse and she is great at acting and singing. However, Degrasse changed her character to a slutty wannabe and I have to wonder if the pictures on this site reflect her or her character. Drinking beer and smoking is really cool if you like that sort of thing, but why is she trying so hard? Mannie is no different from Cassie when it comes to character, so her obvious attempts at seperating her life from her characters was squashed with those amaturistic photos of trying to be cool. Is she even 21 yet? If not, she really should not be broadcasting drinking since believe it or not her listeners are probably viewers of The N which is teen to middle teen. Because of the pictures she gets a 4 star."
3,better than you think it'd be,"So let me tell y'all exactly what this CD sounds like. ""HMFH"" is like the pretty decent demo tape made by that sexy high school chick at your school, circa 1981-1983. You know- the crazy girl who got drunk too often and made it her hobby to flirt with people, but secretly was a little sad on the inside.The production values are rough, to say the least. And a few of Cassie's songs feature some truly heinous lyrics (""Drink Me Dry, ""Love Cost""), but what can you do. She is only 15. I wrote some depressed, self-absorbed junk when I was around that age as well. Thank God I've improved. Let's hope she does the same.All of that said, this CD is my new guilty pleasure. Shh... don't tell anyone. The songs are hella catchy and I quite like Cassie's voice. Yeah, you can tell she's 15, but she sounds like a sexy 15, and that's cool by me."
3,it's cute....,"I do like the outfit! The only problem is the hat doesn't fit my daughter's head. She doesn't have a large head, and is just now 6 months. The rest of the costume is still QUITE big on her. It just wouldn't be the same if she didn't wear the hat, and I'm not sure if there is a way I can make the hat fit."
1,Dreadful,I read a lot of technical books in relation to my work as a software developer and also out of my interest in particular topics. I was highly motivated to read this book having a great deal of interest in the material. Frankly this is one of the worst technical books I have ever read. Actually I can only admit to getting to page 86 before giving up. Technically the material is good and the example code is well presented. Unfortunately the rambling text made the whole experience painful and ultimately I just gave up.
5,Excellent book - pity about APRESS.COM,"This is a excellent book and deals with constructive foundation patterns for AJAX. Talks about when and when NOT to use it.APRESS.COM on the other hand - do not have any source code online for these books and support is 'indifferent'!An additional book of note is ""Pro Ajax and the .NET 2.0 Platform"" ISBN: 1-59059-670-6 which is a simpler entry into AJAX.Also checkout http://www.telerik.com/Default.aspx?PageId=2692 about pragmatic ajax toolkit - this is a whole set of the foundation patterns hardened and ready to use."
4,I Love Lucy Cup,"I love this item, neat design, but part of the pant was already coming off the letters when I received it, new."
1,Fiesta Peachok 6 1/4 oz. fruit bowls,"I was disaapointed when i received these bowls just before Christmas. I thought i'd ordered the wrong style bowl. But now in looking at the photo Amazon just sent me with this request for a review I've realized that what is inaccurate is the photo on your website. Pictured is the small, straight sided cereal bowl, but described is the smaller fruit bowl with the flared edge. I'd wanted the straight sided bowls, but received the flared ones. I still have the bowls but didn't give tme to my daughter for Christmas as I'd planned as she doesn't use that type of bowl. I'd like to receive the small cereal bowls as pictured on your site.Thank you. Merrilyn St. Denis"
1,Wrong photo,"I bought these looking at the photo, these are indeed the 6 ounce fruit bowls and not the small cereal bowl that is pictured. THE PHOTO IS INCORRECT!"
4,Two Sons of Nippon,"Two Sons of Nippon was an interesting and emotional read for me. I was drawn to the strong characters created by J.J. Shay. Having recently returned from a stay in Japan, I was able to make comparisons of the Japan that I saw and the Japan of pre-WWII. Mr. Shay has done his research and presents some interesting questions about events prior to and during the war. He has sparked an interest and wonderment in me about this time in our history."
4,Effective stuff,Effective for relieving muscle pains. Although some people may not like the odor. (It does not bother me).
5,Razor Sharp,"This Razor Sharp kit works great. The wax keeps the blade's edge cool. The edge gets so sharp on my SOG vg-10 blade pocket knife that I don't dare lend it. If you follow the directions exactly, the wheels are safe. Great product."
1,Unuseable dicitonary with no support for Anglo-Saxon Characters,"This is a great reference work. It would be worth a lot more than 99 cents if it were useable. Unfortunately, It is completely useless in this version and is worth nothing. Anglo-Saxon (Old English) has characters that are not in the standard 26 Latin character set. This version garbles them so that they are not recognizeable. Even the text that you can make out ends up being split up in ways that make it hard to read. It is impossible to search for anything because of the character font problem.Too bad! I thought maybe I could search for an Anglo-Saxon word and find it. Does not work. Even searching for words in modern English does not work on this book."
3,to much salt,"and not such a good smell did try tyson was way better would not order it again , just wished to get more dark meat chicken with low sodium"
2,I Doubt It,"I as well as most other 25+ people grew up listening to R.Kelly, however it seems as if he going backwards, to date the last really good cd that he put out would be Chocolate Factory. This cd could have been good if he would stay away from club bangers and focus on the thing that make us love R.Kelly like the erotic love songs and when he gets in touch with his spiritual side. Although some may think it is a bit hypocritical, but most of us have the same personalities. Anyway, this cd seems really forced and I know he could have done better."
2,A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,This is not the R. Kelly we all know and loved instead this is a wannabe rapper (sorta like the Tyreese rap album)I don't think he can rightfully claim to be the king of r&b if he doesn't make r&b music! But in defense of this album I did like the slow cuts (even if some of them are a bit immature) and the Rock Star song is one of my favorites and definately a stand out.
2,Was a little bit disappointed,"I was a little disappointed with this album. Normally, R. Kelly makes really bangin' hits, but this time he fell short. Don't get me wrong there were some cuts, but not as many cuts throughout this CD like previous ones. I recommend that you listen before you buy, Mr. Kels needs to go back to the lab on this one."
4,Gotta luv Kellz,I received this CD as a birthday gift. While it's not the R'uh I am used to hearing crooning out lusty slow ballads it's a welcome change. Had I not gotten it as a gift I definitely would have purchased it.
1,A big disappointment,"I was really looking forward to his album, but once I heard the album I was highly disappointed. The only songs that I really like are Freaky In Club and the Zoo, I like those songs mainly because if the beat. R.Kelly you are very talented, please make your music for the older crowd, because we were all clubbing when we were buying your albums in the 90's."
1,somebody shoot this fool,"kelly's going to hell for real he's a freak, pervert, pedophile claiming he's the pied piper and understands michael jackson yes he's a freak who claims he foubnd god and heaven hug me lord forgive me only to go back to sexing minors and talking about giving girls oral while pouring liqour and claiming he's a gangbanger kelly please stop it I'm sick of you and your music isn't that good anymore do like ike turnwer and rick james and od."
2,Dissapointed,"I have been a long time fan of R Kelly but it is starting to seem like he is stuck in one place....in the club partying with women. I expected more of the crooner side of R Kelly since he is 40 years old now! It is especially dissapointing knowing he is capabale of such great CD's like TP2 and the Chocolate Factory. It appears he has done what with many artists are doing now, rushing through albums just to get something out there and lose focus what made them big in the first place. Carl Thomas CD is much, much better."
1,Not What He Used To Be!,"I will start by sayng that I am a 34yr old who was hooked on Kelly since his start with Public Announcement. I was 16 or 17 and Kelly was the bomb. Somewhere after You Remind Me, it went all wrong! I gues we, his initial audience, became to old for his interest so he aimed for the younger fans and got himself wrapped up.Nevertheless, I supported him. I remember when Chocolate City was released with the bonus Loveland disc, I was the only person waiting to purchase it and got it for only $7.99. Best purchase I ever made as I still play it continously to this day.Well, I have said all this to say it's been a long time for Kelly to still be in the game but it is time he realizes that a 40 yr old SHOULD NOT be still singing about being a babby daddy and tryin to get a number. I mean the same girl track, come on - he nor Usher is 15!I rated this album 1 star because I am not a 13 yr old and two, zeros aren't a choice."
1,grow up,this brother is a joke.he a 40 year old man acting like a 17 year old it's time to grow up. kelly seem to be stuck in a second childhood. the older he get the younger he's dressing and acting this brother got deep mental issue.it's sad if you really look at him he almost middle age his children must be real proud they got a teenager for a daddy.
2,This is NOT HOTT!!,"R Kelly or as he calls himself...""Kells"" is not doing it like he has. Seems like he has lost his focus with this one. To much cussing and talk about sex and strippers. If he continues to cater to the young crowd and the ""Thugs"" of society, he will lose his fan base and be a has been like MC Hammer. I mean, just look at his album cover, is he a thug now? Isn't that what happened to Hammer? Hopefully he comes around and begins to write music again for his loyal fans or else he will lose his over 30 fan base. NEOSOUL06"
5,Double UP,This album is great from beginning to the end. I enjoyed this CD. This album delivers a potent potion of pure signature R&B with some Hip Hop on top. He also joins forces with some of the hottest and best Hip Hop talent and the result is fiercely sexy. This album will have fans around the globe jumping at the oppurtunity to Double Up with R. KELLY
4,No matter what you say he's still the KING of RNB!,"Well yes I must agree with some of the reviewers on here when they say that R-Kelly needs to grow up and start making more mature songs! But is that going to stop people from buying his albums, NO! It sure didnt stop me! lol! but for real this album do have some crazy tracks but I enjoyed it! My favorite song is Bestfriend featuring Keyshia Cole, now that was jammin!"
3,Disappointing Compliation,"This new album compares nothing to that of TP-3, this album is laced with nothing that represents R&B.; He is singing in the style reminiscent of rapping. He seems to be drunk, unhappy, fighting, and targeting this album for clubbers, gangstas, and relationship phobics.R. Kelly usually has more love music, he seems to be very anger about something. I understand club music is what needs to be achieved for record sales, but this album could have been revamped to bring out the R.Kelly that his true fans would buy. This is 21 year old music coming from a veteran in the music game.I expected more from Robert. It is disappointing and typical of him as of lately. Joe came with a true R&B; album. If he is crossing over to reach a certain demographic, then I'd rather not listen. Musiq killed him with all the ballads and even uptempo jams. He needs to go back in the studio and reassess his focus back to Robert and let thug R.Kelly crawl back up under a rock."
2,Where the hell is the King of RnB???,"For the last 15 years I have been a die hard R. Kelly fan...I got a little shaky when the charges came up, But nevertheless I still rocked with him. NOW...I dont know. Its like I'm 24 and even I'm tired of the club songs. I want the R. Kelly that recorded Born in the 90's, 12play, R. Kelly, TP2, R. (2disc) and Chocolate Factory. TP3 and this double up, I can do without. As funny as ""real talk"" is, its nothing you can sing with...nothing you want to sing 10 years from now like you would ""Slow Dance."" This is disposable music thats he's putting out right now! COme on now, 40 yr olds in Doo rags in the club poppin bottles is wack!!! Kells its time to let it go and grow into the legend that you are destined to be...dont mess it up trying to conform to what everyone else is doing, you are much better than that. Tisk, Tisk...this is what Mid life crisis is about..."
2,"It's a shame, Robert","Double Up is right up there with TP.3 as far as being R. Kelly's worst album. Every artist is allowed a foul-up. Kells' foul-up was TP.3, but he's done it again with Double Up. It doesn't appeal to those who came up with him during the time of Born into the 90's, 12 Play, R. Kelly and R. Like many reviewers have stated, R. is 40 now. It's time to make music to reflect it. Double Up has some of the weakest lyrics I've ever heard from an R & B album. You're not 25 anymore, and neither are the majority of your fans. Don't just say you're the ""king of R & B"". Prove it to us."
2,Music for the indiscriminate,"This album is a symptom of a much larger problem as this is what passes for R&B nowadays. R&B has taken on the worst aspects of Hip-Hop radio style with every track being made to bang in the club rather than touch the soul. As the previous reviewer wrote, I too was expecting a little more maturity from a 40-yr-old with Peter Pan syndrome. Throughout this album I wasn't sure if Kelly was trying to get me to dance or just make me laugh. Tracks like ""The Zoo"" and ""Sweet Tooth"" are just to darn juvenile. A concept that you would think a person in his position would be trying to distance himself from. ""Sex Planet"" is just plain dumb and most of the songs dont say anything beyond the usual Rap themes of party and bull. The only saving grace is the tracks are banging so its okay party music to have in the backround if you can turn your brain off to the lyrics. My wife can do that, I'm cursed with the need for substance so I can't do that. 2 1/2 stars"
1,Pedophile,"Can't take any of his songs seriously, everytime I hear him sing I think he's tryin to sing to the 15 and 16 year olds. I'm 18 and I don't hit on girls 15 and 16 years old. R Kelly is about twice my age and he's hittin on little girls. Lost all credibility to me."
1,"Introduction is excellent, main body terrible.","I am excited about the growing field of DIY manufacturing technologies (I.e. any MAKE magazine).I picked up this book, excited that there was someone exploring the future of DIY. The first chapter was excellent, spot-on with what I thought the book would be able. The author ably described the exciting future and the possibilities of change that portable 3D printers, CNC, etc could lead to.The rest of the book (90%) is totally different. It is a short couple of pages on student projects from pupils of the author. Each 2 pages is a different project and summary, usually with a picture. That's ok, but it isn't the most exciting book then. The focus changes completely to just a list of ideas. Some are exciting, some are kinda boring. If you just want a list of cool, exciting ideas and projects it'd be much better to google the Make Blog and get an unlimited list of great ideas (with instructions to DIY).1-star."
1,Permission?,"I'd like to know why my daughter's experience at Fab Lab was used in this book without my consent? Let's see, she's been attending Fab Lab on Saturdays during the school year for 2years now. Why didn't that warrant a request or prompt someone to inform me of what's going on. She is a minor. I also read the section of the book that she's mentioned in and the information is inaccurate."
3,Not Focused enough,"In general the book was interesting, however it seemed unfocused. Often Gershenfeld seemed to be rambling from one point to another without a logical transition. Indeed, sometimes a whole section seemed to lack a discreet point, but instead was just a series of observations.If you enjoy the topic the book will be interesting, but it lacks enough detail to be useable as a reference and the writing isn't quite focused enough to be IMHO a good read."
2,Limited value,"It's hard to take this book seriously when it states (p. 8) ""The term neutral is not defined in Article 100 of the Code. The term is used very sparingly in the Code. Theoretically, there should be no potential difference between the neutral conductor and ground."" In fact, in the 2005 NEC Handbook, it is used twice in Article 100, and 644 times overall. (It appears 315 times in the NEC itself.) Further, the neutral is not always grounded. In a large sidebar in Article 200 of the Handbook, it states ""The grounded conductor is often, but not always, the neutral conductor. For example, in a single-phase 2-wire or in a 3-phase corner-grounded delta system, the intentionally grounded conductor is not a neutral conductor."" The author seems to have an inadequate grasp of his topic, both conceptually and factually. The NEC Handbook is a far better use of readers' time and money."
5,The best of Fritz,This was the best of Mr. Galts 5 books. I have read them all and have enjoyed each one. The Trap was hard to put down and get anything else done. An excellent spythriller and so in tune with our world today. I hope he is at work on another book right now!!
2,Did I just pay for this?,"Unbelievably poor read, this has all the makings of excellent pulp fiction that should have been left at the pulp mill or wherever."
2,OVERPAID,"product is fine, everyone loves them, but I overpaid DOUBLE the price. They are at Sam's Club for 8.99 for the same amount. Never AGAIN"
3,Intro to woodworking,"Feel that the information was valuable but the presentation did not appear to have been professionally prepared. The audio was sometimes muddied and when the presenter misspoke himself, as happens to all of us, there had been no editing to correct the minor mistakes. At this price, nearly $100, I expect a highly professional program."
2,Serious QC issues,"Mine came broken. There was a ground fault, resulting in loud buzzing noise. I returned it and ordered another, and that one had a broken selector switch. I don't know if it's Dean, Amazon or UPS, but I wouldn't get one of these here."
1,Cheap recording like the ones you can make at the mall.,"I cannot understand for the life of me why Sherrie and Lynda would even agree to such a low budget sound. I have heard better sounds from a karaoke bar. Sherrie and Lynda have great voices, why they stoop to putting out low budget sounding music is a disgrace not only to themselves but to the other great ladies that comprises the Supremes. Funny, someone mentioned that Mary Wilson was such an awful singer, if so, why did she remain part of the group the entire time. The woman can sing. I have seen her in concert. Mary is truly Supreme!"
1,disappointing,"Sadly, this CD is not anything but a hoax. Even though I love Sherri Payne and expected her singing there is an unknown on here doing most of the covers and they really should not be attempting to pass themselves off as The Supremes.THis is just a karaoke CD from an unknown for the most part."
1,Fakes.....,Please don't be fooled like I was once. Waste the money for a CD that I thought was a Supremes... Make sure you are buy the Real Supremes. The girls have made alot of money off the Supremes fans thinking they were buy The Supremes...
1,FAKE!,WHO ARE THESE LOSERS? THESE AREN'T THE SUPREMES! IT SHOULD BE ILLEGALFOR THEM TO USE THE NAME SUPREMES!AREN'T THERE ANY TRUTH IN ADVERTISING LAWS?
1,Don't blame Scherrie Payne and Lynda Laurence for this CD.,"Just so EVERYBODY knows, these ladies never promoted themselves as anything except FLOS, Former Ladies of the Supremes. Initially, there were three official Supremes in FLOS, Jean Terrell, Scherrie, and Lynda. But once Jean bowed out, they needed a third lady to complete the group. They have chosen talented ladies to join over the years, and now have Joyce Vincent, from Dawn, who was considered for the Supremes when Mary left before Motown decided to retire the group, since it would not have any original members without Mary.BEWARE! Music licensees took the recordings and of their own doing, released the CDs as THE SUPREMES. Please understand that. DO NOT BUY THE CD, but also, do not hate the ladies, who are very talented in their own right. The website Supreme Voices dot com will give you a peak into their history and also will connect you to Scherrie and Lynda's website regarding their latest efforts."
1,Not worth buying!,"I guess part of the problem is my fault, I didn't realize that 10x in a mirror could only be seen by closing one of my eyes. I could not use this mirror and so I returned it to Amazon and received a full refund plus shipping! Thank you Amazon!"
4,Very good magnification,"This is a great mirror for detail work like plucking eye brows if you are fair and have a hard time seeing strays. The only downside is the stand is not particlary frindly to use, you need to be cautious to hve the mirror inserted at a safe angle. But the mirror is clear and good quality."
3,It's OK,"It's a standard mirror. However, the plastic stand did not fit through the handle, so I had to use sandpaper on the stand. Also, even with the stand, it's not that stable. Stable enough though for three stars.This should be no more that $12."
3,Too heavy for travel!,"This is a beautiful mirror and great value, but it is much too heavy and large to travel with, especially by air with baggage restrictions."
2,not good,"This magnifying mirror works well...when positioned 1-5 inches from your face. At 5-12 inches, everything is a blur. At 18 inches, everything is upside down.In short, provides excellent magnification if you hold it right in front of you. If you plan to place it in the stand and sit back, forget it.I ordered this product after using a counter-top magnifying mirror in a hotel. No comparison!"
3,i should have bought the 5X,This mirror is too strong and after using a 5x I realized I made a mistake. I try to use it but the magnification is such that it is almost impossible.
3,Saves space and frees a hand!,"Inexpensive, cheap (yes, the bad kind), but not that cheap to say it was bought from a knockoff brand at Wal Mart. The stand is very simplistic and helpful. It arrived a bit after the initial estimation date using Amazon's Prime free two-day shipping but it's not like this was a critical item for shipment. The packaging was bare minimum retail and looks like it was inspected so that Amazon wasn't sending damaged goods to me. The sealed plastic bags were a nice touch since this item is glass and is delicate."
3,Very unstable,"It does what it's suppose to do, which magnify - and it does it well. That said, the stability is a real issue. The cheap and narrow plastic holder makes the whole thing pretty inconvenient to use."
3,A little disappointment,"I bought this jacket because of the pretty good reviews here. However it turns out to be con. The sizing is a big issue here. Small or medium size is a normal buy for me. This small size jacket still look huge for me. In addition, it is too heavy. I guess that is the reason this jacket has been on sale forever on [...]."
5,as advertised,"Take note: they come with bulbs, I ordered extra bulbs thinking I read that they didn't come with them. oops, my bad. For this price point you can't beat."
4,Plastic would last longer,Good price and provide the light I want. Only real problem is the metal corrodes and the light socket corrodes to mush after only a couple years. May be the severe SE Texas weather but I think the quality could be significantly improved.
4,LT9 Malibu light,"Just as advertised. However, it's made of cheap materials (China) and the female threads of the set screws on two out of three lights were stripped. That's probably normal for this type of device.Jeff Winholt"
2,Flimsy Construction,The cylindrical housing around the lens is attached to the body in a very flimsy manner and comes out easily
4,A good light for the money,"I'll make this short and to the point.PROS:The lamp head is made of lightweight but sturdy metal.The gasketing seems adequate. After a month's use I see no evidence of leakage.The beam shape is even without hotspots.The price is excellent considering the relatively high quality.CONS:The ground stake is plastic and not as sturdy as the lamp head.The power connectors are downright cheesy. Small and made of flimsy plastic, they looked like they would fail in the first week. I used 12 guage wire and the connectors are actually too small for that guage. To avoid problems, I coated mine thoroughly with silicone sealant."
1,get the 20W instead...,"I have just installed a system with both these 10W and some 20W lights, too. You would think they would be the same in all respects except the bulb. Actually, the 10W don't come fully assembled like the 20W and they are very weird to put together. It isn't much...you just have to screw the stake part on, but when you do this the wiring gets twisted and twisted . Poor design. The 20W ones are constructed of much sturdier feeling materials and I would only order more of these in future."
4,"Hilariously dated, but very informative.","The pictures in this book just make you imagine the set of a '90s Star Trek: The Next Generation episode. It's fun. But the author makes a lot of good points, and illustrates his information well. There really aren't a lot of books on this subject, and this one is good to pick up."
3,Radical Feminine Artistic Freedom for the times...,"""If I'm in luck, I might just get picked up."" Wow! A very honest and in your face declaration from an artist during this early period of the 70's. Betty Davis was no mainstream artist and by today's standards she would have been alternative/punk.This album explores the vicissitudes of being a woman and exercising independence, sexual freedom and the competitive nature of relationships involving women and men.Funky, grooves and straight to the point. Cleopatra Jones would have approved...:)"
1,the worst nevsky iv heard,"THIS STUNK BIG TIME,IT MIGHT BE MORE AUTHENTIC RUSSIAN SOUNDING BUT THAT DOES NOT MAKE IT GOOD (INTERPRETATION WISE, PLAYING)get Dutiot or even Slatkin OR DARE I SAY PREVIN.GERGIEV HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE MOST OVERRATED CONDUCTERS OF TODAY."
3,Missing Connectors!!!!,"The Brasscraft flex lines are very well made and the connectors seem very well made, but like other reviews this item was shipped without the 3/4"" FIP connector. Very poor quality control on someones part!!Now I have to try and find a way to either get them to ship the missing connector or bite the bullet and spend the 8-9 extra dollars and try to find one local. What a pain in the butt!!I don't want to return the item, but there is no option for missing parts."
5,When nobody else has what you need,Couldn't find this at any local supply house and I tried them all. Quality product. Fast service. Fair and reasonable price.
1,Not as described,"This was suppose to include flare fittings. One for each end of the gas line. But didn't. They offered me a 20 percent discount, but without the fittings it is useless. So I returned it and the return process was a breeze. They even had UPS come to my home to pick it up!"
4,"Not a miracle, but it is helpful","I have three litter boxes, and four cats. I scoop quite regularly and I find often, because my cats like the corners of the litter boxes that everything sticks there.So I used this in all three boxes when I did my monthly complete clean of the litter area. I sprayed this in and waited fifteen minutes as the directions said. It did still look wet, but I poured the litter in anyway and for about the first week of the month this spray really makes scooping a breeze. Then it seems to wear off and I have three weeks of the old sticky scooping before I do the complete clean again. So I find it helpful, but wished it would last longer."
4,Help with litter,"Anything that hekps litter not to stick to the rake or bottom of litterbox is appreciated Heard about this from a friend and decided to try it. It woeks okay and if you are having trouble with litter sticking to the littermaid rake, I would recommend you try this."
1,Not worth it,It worked for about two weeks and then the box was back to it's old sticky ways... unless your wiling to take your box and scrub it clean every few weeks and re-spray... it's not worth it.
4,Works and helps the smell,Does exactly what is says it will. We have 2 cats and they had no issues when we spayed the litter. And it makes clean up that much easier. NO MORE SCRAPING.
2,Not as expected,"The instructions say to spray liberally and let it dry. Guess what? Water doesn't soak in to hard plastic very well. Even in a warm room it took hours to 'dry'. Filling the box with litter afterwards still caused the bottom layer to get wet.It seems to make a difference after a day of waiting as long as your cat doesn't go more than once and scrap the bottom too much.Unfortunately the effect seems to wear off after two or three weeks. Since it's a pain to take the box apart, scrub it and then spray it with this I haven't reapplied the spray. I don't have hours to spend breathing cat litter fumes for the sake of saving a bit of scraping.The ironic part is that if you have the time to properly apply this spray, then you have more than enough time to scrape out the box on occasion. If you're pressed for time, the amount of time that it takes to apply this will be seriously longer than the time savings.In my view? Not worth it."
2,The item works if you empty and redo the litter box every three days,You have to empty the automatic litter box every three days and take the rake out and clean and spray every three days
2,NO STICK LITTER SPRAY,"Not very impressed. I would use Armor-All; Cheaper and just as good, plus more versatile."
2,save your money,"When the Smart Scoop No-Stick Litter Box Spray was shipped to me the bottle had leaked in the box, and had gotten all over several other items I had purchased at the same time. Overall, the spray didn't work very well. I followed the instructions, but the cat ""stuff"" still stuck to the bottom of the litter tray. I don't think I would buy form this brand again; the Smart Scoop Scoop-N-Sift I bought with the spray was worthless also."
5,This is a great product!,"As the mom in a multi-cat household, cleaning litter boxes was a three times a day chore made difficult for someone with a bad back by having to apply pressure to scrape the corners and bottoms of the boxes. With this new product, named one of the year's best by the editors of Cat Fancy, my ""chores"" are so much easier now! Basically a cat-safe ""Pam"" for litter boxes, this product is sprayed on the inside of the boxes, making scooping a breeze! The litter no longer sticks to the sides and bottom of the boxes, and my scoop (also sprayed) glides right through the litter now. The scoop stays clean, and this product also makes the litter clump even better, reducing the small particles usually left behind. I find that I'm using less litter, thus reducing costs as well. I highly recommend this product to anyone with cats, and am so glad I found it!"
1,No difference noticed,I have large cats and they tend to cause large amount of litter to stick to the sides of litter boxes. I had hoped that this would keep the litter from sticking but I am not able to see any difference. I have followed the instructions and waited for the spray to dry before filling the litter boxes but that does not seem to make any difference.
4,Fame Isn't Always the Way to Go,I enjoyed this book and was anxious for my teenage granddaughters to read it. Delilah comes from a small town. Her life is simple until she meets a good looking guy from Hollywood who asks her to be his date at the Oscars. It's a book that most teenage girls will love.Martha's Freedom Train
4,Money well spent!!!,"This book is a wonderfully rich source of information on the developement of quite a few turbine engines. The information is well researched and concise, given in a format that is broken down by the manufacturer. There is alot of information on some small turbine engines developed for cruise missle applications that I have not seen elsewhere. There are a decent amount of photos that give a good sense of most of the engines. I wonder though with all the research that was done for this book if many more interresting photos were left out?The introduction is good and the information they present with the problems involved in design and production of small scale turbine engines is very interresting.All in all this is money well spent for anyone who enjoys the history of gas turbine engines."
1,Huh!!!,"The second Telos book is a poor follow-up to the opening adventure of this range Time and Relative.I have never been a fan of Dave Stone since I thought his stories are too weird for my taste.Like Time and Relative, the Doctor hardly appears at all in this book.While Time and Relative focussed heavily on Susan, Citadel of Dreams does not give the same treatment to Ace.Citadel of Dreams instead focusses on a character called Joey Quine.After reading the book I was completely baffled on what the story is about. If you had better luck understanding the story then congratulations."
1,Moog is not what it used to be...,"Should have bought the Nissan part. Two years/~20,000 miles later I will have to replace this on my wife's car. The rubber is shot and that affects the alignment of the strut which affects the camber and caster of the wheel. Huge disappointment! Sad part is that I just learned I paid MORE for the Moog part than I would have paid from my trusty Nissan parts source[...]"
5,A Book to be Shared!,"This book was recommended to me by a friend. I had her book first and loved the feeling I had when I read it so I bought one for myself. I gave mine to my sis and bought me another. If you have a heavy heart, you need this book and if you want to FEEL GOD present in your life. Keep it close to you!"
5,GOD'S PSYCHIATRY,"THE BOOK IS EXCELLECT SOURCE FOR ALL MANKIND. i HAVE SHARED IT WITH OTHERS. LOVE IT , AND I KEEP IT IN MY PURSE AT ALL TIMES."
5,Good Christian book,"I love Christian books, even the ""old"" ones such as ""God's Psychiatry"". Excellent read, I recommend it!!! Am especially pleased to have it on my KindleFire."
1,Problems after 10 hrs of use,Bought from Menards. Used a total of 10hrs and the handle started leaking all over. Called up McCulloch company and they said they would and could only sell me the whole assembly for $50 + S&H. Never again will I buy McCulloch Junk!! Disatisfied customer from WI.
4,It's been a while...,"I listened to this album sometimes when I was between 14-17 years old, and now I'm 28. I loved it - not every song, but just his voice and the way he sang. The two songs I remember most are Through the Flame, and The Love of God. Back then I listened to the audio cassette, so I couldn't program my favorites and I had to listen to them all, but these are the only two I can remember.If you've never heard The Love of God - it is one of the most beautiful songs I've heard anyone sing. To me, it's on par with Rise Again. It's wonderful poetry set to powerful, moving music in the best possible way. Years later I still sing that song to myself on occasion, sometimes evoking a tear or two.The rest of the album I can't remember all that much, but I liked it a lot when I did listen to it back then, hence the 4 rating."
1,Expired lipstick!,Unfortunately this lipstick I believe it was very old. It does not smell fresh. I regret buying it. I wonder for how long the seller had it :(
3,quality product but wrong color,"I liked the lipstick ,had nice feeling on my lips and lasted fairly long. But the color was wrong for me. I am tired of buying lipstick that ends up being the wrong color... I have a collection of colors that don't work for me..wish there were more acurate descriptions of the colors..."
3,As advertised,"This product works as advertised. You should be very careful about purchasing this as it does not make your signal stronger, rather it repeats a signal picked up by the larger of the two devices. If your house has only 1bar all over, and you put this in your house, you will not receive any benefits.However, if there is an area where you receive reception much better then the rest of your house or apartment, this can be used to repeat that signal in one of the lower strengh zones. This was my situation, where I had 3 bars in my living room window, and 1 bar or nothing in the rest of the apartment. After setting this up it (most of the time) will give me 2-3 bars in the rest of my living room, and 1-2 bars in the connecting room (up from 0-1). It seems to work better in good weather."
2,Is it really worth the money?,"I'm a t-mobile subscriber. When I bought my current home, I had virtually no service, except for a few specific areas in the house or on the deck. This unit, although helpful does not deliver on its promises. I moved from zero-to-one bar to one-to-sometimes-two bars. The reception is better, but only marginally. I still have many dead spots in the house, even 15 feet from the unit."
1,Don't waste your time... It doesn't work!,"I followed the directions exactly, and I spend way too much time trying different locations throughout the house to mount the equipment. Nothing worked. I didn't get any signal improvement at all, not 1 bar!"
2,Not as good as First Lessons Banjo,Cumbersome to play along with the CD. Variation in speeds of each song is not productive.For more specifics see my review forMel Bay First Lessons Banjo
4,Banjo Primer,I got this book for a friend at work who is starting the banjofor the modern banjo style of bluegrass. This person likes itvery much. Everett Boxdorfer
5,The Bond Man,Nothing beats a cold winter night with the Bond Man and Ian Fleming-I only wish he would have written more books about Bond-some other writers have tried but he is the best-
4,One of the Better Villians,"I've heard rumors that this book was unfinished at the time of Fleming's death and that would make sense.I feel like this book really had a lot of potential. It starts with Bond in a very different beginning as opposed to the several books where he is simply called into M's office for a mission. The attempt on M's life and the realization that Bond ended up brainwashed by the KGB was quite novel for the Bond series.Of course M had to give Bond a chance to redeem himself and taking out Scaramanga is the perfect assignment.I liked how Scaramanga is introduced to Bond...the aura and the setting are just perfect.The plot does well but it seems to just end abruptly, which may point towards someone else finishing this work instead of Fleming. That or Fleming just ran out of time.Anyway, this is a quick book to read and it has some of the more memorable scenes of the series, in my opinion."
1,Horrible,"Seems like Mr. Fleming took the day (or week, or month) off when he wrote this one. Absolutely awful. Perhaps he was ill at the time, whatever the excuse, there IS no excuse for this sorry excuse of a book. Reads like something a high schooler would write. Scaramanga is the WORST Bond villain ever. Miss Goodnight is the WORST Bond girl ever. Bond fans, skip this one, it is literally unreadable bilge."
3,"Bond's final fun, suspensful novel","Although it wasn't one of the best, Golden Gun is an enjoyable read. It pits our favorite spy against a deadly assassin; a sucide mission in which Bond must keep his wits and his Walther ready. The action moves at a nice pace as Bond has to stay one step ahead of Scaramanga. It was a fun book, and I recomend it."
2,One of Fleming's Weakest Novels,"The beginning of the book was interesting, but goes downhill. Unfortunatly, Fleming died before finishing the book and the book was finished for him. The result is a weak ending."
5,Thank Goodness... it finally reached God's Country!,This is a wonderful cd and faded is a spectacular song...with a title like the one this review has...need I say more...oh yeah...BUY IT!
5,HOTTIES!!,"SOULDECISION'S 1ST SINGLE ""FADED"" IS 1ST SINGLE.THIS IS A REALLY GOOD DANCE SONG.AND THE RAP IS OK THEY COULD DO WITHOUT IT BUT IT IS STILL GOOD.AND THIS SINGLE ALSO COMES WITH A REMIX OF ""FADED""."
4,Buyer Beware (see Below),"If you are buying this from Amazon.com it's important you should know that all they are doing is burning the CD making a photo copy and dumping it off to you, There are no Credits (who's playing on the album) and NO LINER NOTES or pictures (other than the cover). I thought I would tell you because they don't mention it anywhere."
2,Great idea! Let's do Obama next,"This is a disrespectful production whatever your politics may be. Liberals are the ""kinder"" and ""more civil"" group, right? I can only imagine the screams from the left if this paper doll were Obama-themed."
3,Bosch Colt,"Not what I expected. The router was well used, beat up, but runs. Lock on height adjustment has adjustment nut that is not useable and has to be replaced before I can use the router. I wouldn't recommend purchasing a well used router(factory-reconditioned) from Bosch. It's on the bench waiting to be fixed some day."
2,Looks like it's been used for years,"I'll give the Bosch Colt 5 stars. It's a great trim router. As far as buying refurbished units, I'll not do it again. At $95 used vs $115 new, I'd take the new one any day. The first unit was so beaten up that I had to return it. I've had tools that are 5-6 years old in my garage that is in better shape. All scratched up, cord starting to crack. To there credit, and this is the reason for 2 stars rather than one, they exchanged it without much hassle. They won't cross ship it. But return shipping is free. The second unit is a bit better. Just a bit. I'm worried that with the amount of use, how long the motor brush will last before replacement. To those who got an 'almost new' unit, you are lucky. That may not be typical. This whole process took me over 2 weeks, a bit of hassle, and in the end I saved $20. Not worth it. Definitely not worth it. Save your self the hassle and uncertainty and go for the sure thing. Buy a new unit."
2,don't they test these things?,"The motor cut out on the first pass and refuses to restart. I'll send it back and get another since the features on this seem to be the best of the lot for the price, but you would think they would do a better job of thoroughly testing these before they send them out for resale- factory reconditioned should be more than just cleaning it up."
4,Outstanding Router...Factory Reconditioned--a Good Deal,I am very pleased with this Bosch factory reconditioned trim router. It feels good in my hands and is powerful for heavy work.I have purchased several power tools from the Bosch reconditioning factor and have been pleased with all purchases. I also enjoy the money savings that provides!Damon Shodrock
5,Basic coax coupler,"Nothing to special here, just a simple silver colored coax cable coupler. I used it to add an extended run of cable from my wall outlet to the other side of the room when I moved my TV. Threads are smooth and it installed easily."
4,Quick service,"I got this product really fast, however I can not use it ONLY BECAUSE ""I"" ordered the wrong item. I am saving it for the day I may need it. :)"
1,Doesn't work at all - keep looking,"I had an old, cheap Craftsman stud finder that worked well but died. I bought this one to replace it but it's terrible. There was no consistency to the readings - one pass it would indicate a stud, and then the next it would not register anything."
1,does not work,"doesn't work. i echo the other review here that says that it's inconsistent, gives different readings each time, AND, unique to my experience, i had to go back to the hardware shop when i opened the darned thing and a piece flew out, and it wouldn't close properly again. very poorly made, piece of crap equipment. i wish i had gotten the craftsman one instead even though it was about 5 bucks more. definitely worth it if it works! which is more than what this poor excuse for a tool can say about itself."
1,battery doesn't last,Battery failed after a year's worth of occasional light use. Tried to recondition per the instruction in the manual with no improvement.
1,Typical,Works great for the first month or two like most battery hand held vacuums...then it may as well be tossed out.
1,Poor Condition Upon Opening,"This product had a defective release tab for emptying dirt. While it is light and requires less space than other similar hand-held products, it seemed poor in quality. I purchased it from a regular retail store and may return it if performance is poor."
2,DOA,This unit arrived with a broken tab. This tab is to hold the dust cup and the motor together. I believe it was a desgined flaw since there is no damaged on the package nor the exterior shipping box. Return to Amazon was easy.
4,great for the price,this hand vac is a nice size and great for picking up small amounts of light things. i haven't tried it with wet stuff yet.
2,Cordless wet/dry Vac,"Well i cannot really comments on the actual product because when i received it, it was broken - could not be used.With i believe took place during Shipping.However, i must say that the return policy on Amazon is quite good, and responsive. The procedure was simple and to the point, with LIVE email correspondence from Amazon. I was indeed impressed."
2,Not as great as it sounds,This keyboard has a very cheap look and feel. Mouse touch pad is very jumpy. Not worth sales price at all. I returned it after 3 days. Key layout is horrid as well.
2,"cheap, cheap, cheap!","Terribly cheap keyboard, mouse started giving out after two weeks of use, and the keys seem to stick, it's very difficult to type with.You can find a better quality, wireless, for $40 at Fry's electronics.I was disappointed when I realized this.... Also, the wireless one advertised on amazon for around $80 is also terrible cheap, it's pretty much the same exact model, I returned it ASAP, don't bother with it."
1,"Nice idea, poor quality","I have the PS/2 version of this keyboard. See my review for that item. The trackpad, always unreliable, has failed completely.Adesso's products are poor quality, and their customer service is bad as well."
5,works great,"This is a great wireless keyboard. We bought it to use on a PC we hooked to our 46"" LCD TV. It is perfect. We can sit on our couch and use the computer on the big screan. The range is great and we have had no problems. We did have a problem in the beginning because were we stored it a key must have been pushed on and the battery died before the next use. We are now more careful how we store it. The mouse pad is great for sitting on the couch where there is no practical way to use a mouse or track ball. The size is perfect and light weight."
5,"Cut Loose: Stack. Slice, Switch, and Sew","I like her style!Jan Mullen is an Australian quilter who has a wonky view of regular quilts and making them fun. She calls them ""Stargazey Quilts"", which is also the name of her pattern company.""Cut Loose Quilts-Stack, Slice, Switch, and Sew"" really describes her style. Then she uses bright colours and unusual fabrics together. The key to her quilts is to be rule breaking. I have been a follower of her work for a while. No Quilt Police here!"
4,Think outside the box,"This is a very good book. Her explanations are clear, and she goes step by step. You can see that if you could just think as creatively/out of the box/sideways as she does that you could make this stuff as easily as she does. I can't. So I am greatful to have something to refer to over and over as I try to make something that I really like, but can not begin to create on my own. If you need a little push to make something unusual and beautiful then this is a good book for you. I have made most of the blocks that she shows for practice so I can attest that they are all pretty easy...if you can just get your mind away from sewing 90 degree squares.Buy it."
5,"Quilting book, by Jan Mullen","This is a great book for the beginner(which I am) all the way up to advanced. I love the choice of colors that Jan Mullen uses, as well as her ('ish') method. For instance in this book, no 1/4"" seam allowance . . . it is 1/4ish"" seam allowance. It is fun, and takes on a whole new approach on quilting, no straight lines, everything is 'askew' but ends up a straight square.Nothing but Fun/bright quilts in here!"
4,Exciting,"Jan really shows you how to step outside the box. If you ever get the chance, attend one of her seminars if you like colour and attempting something new. She is a great teacher and she also likes purple."
2,review,"I did like the book even though I wasn't what I thought, but I think it was tooo much expensive. My friend bought the same book at a book store two times cheaper than mine"
2,They tear too easily,"they did not hold up to one days wear, They are too thin and go a hole the first day."
4,good price,very good price nice quality...i was happy to find them at such a great deal some place's want up to $65.00 a pare
2,Extremely tight,"I found these to be extremely tight and about one inch too long to be comfortable on my legs. They appear to be well made, but I'm not at all sure I'll be able to use them on a regular basis. I understood from the description that they would be 'light compression' but discovered them to be quite the opposite. (I'm 5'11"" and weight less then 190#). Rubber gloves will be necessary to help put them on.Good luck."
2,Professional Activa Men's Light Compression Socks 15-20mm/Hg,"My first item of contention was the long time it took for delivery of package. Ordered online 08-02-2010, Did not receive package until 08-10-2010 via FedX ground shipping. To add insult to injury Amazon has a third party vendor that does not provide package tracking...You would think that would be a top priority for ALL items shipped that Amazon represents.After wearing socks for only two days the threads are starting to unravel. I am not a happy camper. Too frustrated to send back! Who knows how long this will take to be corrected."
5,Easy to install and sturdy,You can't beat the price! The shoe rack is sturdy and took seconds to install. You will see evidence of the clips on the exterior when the door is closed but what else would you expect? Because it mounts at the top and bottom there is no risk of swinging as you open or close the door. It is exactly what I wanted.
4,"A hip ""La Traviata""","Camille 2000 is a tale of a rich Italian businessman, Armand, who falls in love with Marguerite, a rich French Madam. The story follows the opera ""La Traviata"", which is not new territory for Metzger (Carmen, Baby), and is based on the Alexandre Dumas story ""Lady of the Camellias"". The most interesting aspect of this film is the use of color, the extravagant costumes, and the photography. This film has a reputation as being a sort of ""soft-core"" sex film, but actually it is very tame compared to many other adult films from that decade. The film does have some flaws, such as editing and acting, however it is visually soothing. The soundtrack by Piero Piccioni is the best psychedelic film music I have ever heard. A good choice for fans of that ""Peter Max"" look."
3,"The Films Are Classics, The Transfers Are Marginal","Own these films individually on DVD from Image Entertainment. Nice to have them in boxed sets like this though I must let Metzger fans know that the transfers from First Run are not as good as the Image versions. Where the Image versions are color saturated and sharp, the First Run transfers have murky, faded out color and soft pictures.Still, for the price, these boxed sets aren't a bad buy."
4,GREAT EARLY 70s PSYCHO-ITALIANA,"An old story gets a soft-porn twist in Metzger's 1970 outing. Some artfully framed sex scenes, Piero Piccioni's catchy, sexy soundrack, and some fun costumes of the period-imagining-the-not-too-distant-furture make the enterprise a cut way above most films of this genre. Production design fans will like it for no reason other than its aesthethic, which recalls Pietro Germi's great TENTH VICTIM of four years earlier (1966). This was Metzger's best foray before Zalman King usurped the genre (you know, TWO MOON JUNCTION and all that jazz). What one should really do though is find the incredible score by Maestro Piero Piccioni (available on Easy Tempo Records). It's a seductive tapestry of orchestral, psychedelic, and organ-funk sounds with a never-ending bass line.Art...uh, no. Wack, fun filmmaking of its period, most certainly."
1,"Review of the DVD, not the film: Image quality is bad","I purchased this DVD for Camille 2000 and expected to be swept away with the film's lush and sensual sensibilities. Instead, I had to stop watching it 30 minutes into it. The transfer is terrible. It's full of scratches and it's out of focus or taken from a very old film stock. It's truly terrible and felt that I was ripped off because DVDs today have a certain standard for image quality which this one obviously disregarded. It's not worth paying for this. Wait until a better transfer comes along."
5,Excellent Arizona History,"As a native Arizonan, I spent many years in and around the area of the setting of this book. The descriptions are crisply accurate, and the author's affinity for the West emerges on every page. She tells mini-stories with wry amusement spiced with realism so that readers are drawn into the daily life that cattlemen of that era lived. As shown in the wolf hunt chapter, the daily wrestle with nature and life in the West is not minimized into misled modern concern for animals with fangs. This is no glamorous depiction.Readers aren't treated to romantic fake napery and crystal settings on the table as so many popular Western writers like to feature. Instead, there are honest portrayals of a happily satisfying life among the cactus, cowboys and horses."
3,Not the best but OK,"It's pretty basic and wasn't as informative as I would have hoped for, but for the price, it does give you the basics of the human body.It loaded on my Vista plateform just fine, but the graphics and resolution seems outdated. Had I paid more for it, I would have been very disapointed."
1,Too small,"The clips are too small to hold a pin curl well, which also makes it too easy to tangle and trap individual strands of hair in the back end of the clip. I am looking for another clip to replace these. My hair is slightly longer than shoulder length, so perhaps these clips would work better on shorter hair."
2,It is just ok.,It is very low quality clips.. If you are looking for something sturdy and that last longer don't make a try with this...
2,Unhappy,Received the wrong item and I was goingto use them to make a gift for someone now I have to return and wait for the right thing to complete the gift. Or just make this item work. Not very happy.
4,Nice strong hold,"I purchased these clips so that I could make bows for my daughter's hair. Other than being a bit smaller than I hoped they would be, they hold her hair well and are consistently well made."
4,polly,The clips came in a timely manner but was not the clips I order what came was the double prong pinch clips. I kept them becauce I didn't want to go through the work of returning them.
3,Single Prong Clips,"I ordered these but had to return them. The quality of the clips and functionality are great. This particular box didn't have the right amount inside, and I received some of the clips broken. I guess I just got a bad box, this wouldn't make me not want to purchase these clips from Amazon again. Amazon was great with letting me return the item. I would have exchanged but I needed them sooner. I make homemade hair clips and hair bows for my daughter, this brand is one of my favorites. The price is acceptable too."
3,Ok,These are the same style that you can get at Hobby Lobby. I just don't care for hobby Lobby and it is farther than the other craft stores. They look the same but are not as sturdy as the ones you get from the craft stores. I think when I need more (I won't be using these for hair clips) I will be seeing if my closest craft store can order them in bulk for me. These will work fine for curlers but are not sturdy enough in my opinion for use when making children's barrettes.
2,Broken Box,I got the product and the box was broken so the clips were everywhere in the package. They were not the size I had wanted either.
1,Aliagator clips,I only received 65 of the clips when there was suppose to be 80. Plus half of the 65 clips were bent. I will not purchase these again.
2,Not what I was hoping for,"These clips are small and poor quality. They feel like they are going to break when you squeeze them. The teeth are not lined up perfectly either. Sometimes it is better to buy things in person to test them out, instead of purchasing on the internet and then being disappointed when you receive them 5 days later."
4,Good Buy,"I bought these because on a recent trip to the mall I encountered one of those carts that sell random stuff, this one sold hair ribbons for babies and toddlers. It was $5.50 for two, they were so simple looking I thought ""I could probably make thse myself with some ribbon, a hair clip, some glue and a charm. I was right. I bought some ribbon (3/8""), hot glue gun ($4.00 for countless glue), some charms (about 15 cents each), and these clips, which are about 7 cents each... It cost me less than 30 cents per hair clip and were super easy. As for the actual product, it is just as good as any other hair clip you can buy anywhere else. They seem to catch a tiny bit on my toddler's hair, but that is true of any hair clip of this kind. I would recommend these."
1,they need to say the size,i bought these to make hair clips but at an inch i cant do anything with them. If you are making clips for little girls or babies these are perfect but since i make for teens and adults theyre useless! In my opinion they REALLY need to say that these clips are an inch long so more people dont waste their money. Plus the one i took out of the box bent right away. Not impressed
2,Pass this book up!!,"I seriously doubt whether or not Diane Warner has planned anyone's wedding except her daughter's. Some of her ""brilliant"" money-saving ideas are just plain laughable. Can't afford a big cake? Make one out of Styrofoam and have someone stand behind it, serving a regular sheet cake. Can't afford a honeymoon? Tell everyone you know you're going to the Bahamas and stay at home for a week.Give me a break. Sometimes, cutting corners cuts good taste right in half."
2,"Not for everyone, but useful","I bought this book after I got engaged. I have since read it twice, looking for ideas that may help me save at my wedding. I found several ideas that I could try, although most are directed at the do-it-yourselfers. I can't seem to find the time to do all the planning, along with making decorations, baking food and growing flowers. As a young woman with a small baby to raise, I found this book helpful with some nice ideas, but without the time to do them in. Overall this was a good book for those that have the time and energy to make most of the wedding yourself. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people."
1,Save your money: don't buy this book.,"Luckily this book was given to me as an engagement present. I had purchased Bridal Bargains and had gotten a lot of really great ideas and Websites links. So, when I began reading this one I naively assumed that all money-saving books were of the same caliber. Yaaaah, no.Less than a chapter into it I had to look at the Copyright date to see how long ago it had been written. I'm sure she's a lovely person (I kinda feel bad for writing a bad review), but this book is really outdated. If you want to save some money, pass this puppy up and buy Bridal Bargains by Denise & Alan Fields: it's more comprehensive, practical, and up-to-date."
4,The book has some excellent ideas for a bride on a budget.,"Although some of the ideas in the book were a little bit to tacky, most gave me some great ideas to apply to my own wedding. There were some excellent reception themes and sample budgets."
2,Don't Bother With This Book,"This book is pretty much everything your friends and family suggested to you when you spoke of having a small budget for your wedding.The author herself seems a lovely person, but frankly, some of the advice is insultingly simple minded.The best book to buy is ""Bridal Bargains""."
1,"Pass this one, please.","When I ordered this book, I thought that it would be full of wonderful ideas that would help with planning a very budget-tight wedding. After looking through the book, I sent it back to Amazon. Some of the author's ideas were just a little too chintzy for me, like having the groomsmen and ushers bring their own shoes for the tuxes, borrowing flowers from people, or growing your own flowers. My suggestion- pass this book up and check out Denise and Alan Field's Bridal Bargains."
2,This was cute but...,"Cute book, but lets be realistic. Its 2012. This book is kind of old. Honestly i felt like the main points in this book were for an 'over done' wedding. Doves? Ice sculptures? NO! Not what i expected."
3,Good technical treatise.,"This book is a good reference for construction attorneys and construction principals. It did not go into the precise nature of the relationship between a sub-contractor and his general contractor regarding their respective obligations and expectations. In particular, I wanted to know if an electrical contractor is relieved of the ""design"" aspect of a ""Design/Build"" project if the general contractor hires an independent electrical engineering firm."
2,Unnecessary release of bad 1993 concerts,"Previously released as ""The Reunion"" in 1995 and later as ""Best of Ekseption"" (no less!) this is a cheapo CD containing recordings from two German concerts in November 1993.Playing is sloppy - the Hammond organ introduction to Peace Planet is downright awful - and these versions add nothing new to the original material. OK, so I have been a fan since day 1, but this CD fills me with feelings of shame. Avoid or at least be warned!"
4,"Good, but sometimes the plastic door comes open","I like this hopper a lot, the paintballs rarely get stuck. However, every once in a while the hopper door comes open and then it's a game of 173-pickup. Not good during the middle of a paintball game. But other than that, it is a good product and not bad for the price."
5,on the road to...,"i agree with jeff, review above. he says it all. the drumming is spectacular and inventive. really a joy to listen to max roach on this record. how unique to listen in a context of sharing time and space with one other player, only. allows roach to really stretch out. braxton solos are pretty cool. sometimes his tone is annoying but, then i am eric dolphy, bunky green fan. braxton is a iconoclast idea man; dolphy an idea person also {i like} but, dolphy kicks butt as an instrumentalist and improvisor. dolphy, leagues ahead of braxton on all horns, i believe; but, i like this modern approach with the exploratory ideas on this recording. worth the money. check out dewey redman and ed blackwell {tenor and drums} 'red / black: live in willisau' on black saint, also. mz"
4,heart breaking,"this book was so good it's my second time reading it. it was touching. i felt that the author left alot of things unsaid. what happen to chance an dani did the reconcile, what happen to maria, like i felt either the book should be longer or make a sencond 1 becuz the ending left you naked"
3,Not one of the best !!,"Valerie can tell a mean story. In Playing My Mother's Blues, I have to give her credit for the storytelling aspect. The storyline itself, I found to be rather shallow. The mystic lasts until the very end of the story, so you don't have to read very much longer after the story comes together. It depends on what type of material ""floats your boat"", as to whether or not you'll like this book. It is a quick read, so if you would like to read something light .... go for it ..."
2,Disappointed,"I am an avid reader and I enjoy most things written by Ms. Wesley. I enjoyed the story line, but I felt that there were too many things that were left unsaid. I felt as though the book ended rather abruptly. I was left with a lot of questions and was confused as to where she was going with some of the characters stories. She never really wrapped up the stroy. I hope that this means there is another book in the works to finish telling the story."
1,I wish I could give it a far lower rating!,"The Bickershaw Festival DVD, at 30 bucks I might add, is an utter ripoff.Either terrible or nonexistent camera work, terrible sound, repeated still shots instead of performances, shots from behind the artists, and concert footage that's not from the actual Bickershaw festival! With the exception of Captain Beefheart, NOWHERE on the DVD packaging is it mentioned you won't be seeing complete live performances. There's no footage of the Kinks at all!I would never pay $30 to see crowd shots, marginally interesting interviews, and one garbled song per artist.Avoid this DVD at all costs! Get the 2007 Crossroads Guitar Festival instead."
1,An Absolute Disgracee,"This is utter garbage, an abomination of epic proportions. Avoid the disapointment. The audio and the video don't match at all. I love all the bands, but unfortunately you don't get any real performances. The people who marketed this as a concert video should be ashamed of themselves. Apparantly the producers of this DVD are unfamiliar with the concept of shame. They should be. I bought this, and returned it the next day."
5,Unakite,I have recently become interested in gem stones and Unakite and Sodalite are two favorites. The color in these earrings is perfect and shows through. I am very pleased with this purchase. The earrings are beautiful and the length is wonderful.
2,Deceptive marketing,"One of the two reasons I purchased this modem was to try the Modem-on-hold capability of V.92 technology. (It is clearly marked on the box as a selling point.) What is missing is the NetWaiting utility. After 5 days and four e-mails to tech support, I was finally informed that the software for the Modem-on-hold does not exist and that they are working on a beta.It delivers faster connnectivity and speeds higher thatn 56K but if you want the modem-on-hold, go elsewhere."
2,Peelu Toothpowder,Plain indeed. I thought the taste was insipid with a yuck factor. I had to stop using it. I am sure it works fine if used.
1,You will need a bath after this movie !,"Another squeamish Isabelle Huppert monster from the back lots of the film noir school of French cinema. If you left the room for her role in ""The Piano Teacher,"" you'll need a double dose of antacid - or vodka - for this Oedipal tale of a young Catholic educated Frenchman vacationing in the Canary Islands and ""initiated"" to the joys and pains of S&M by his inebriated mother, the disgustingly creepy Ms. Hubert and her fetching younger friends."
1,putrid awful pretentious brain poison in filmic form,"Prime example of what is wrong with the French subconscious, and with everything else that derives and is born from it. In a world where there is no absolute truth and no right or wrong, where every tenet of beauty is thrown into the trash (ie postmodernism in all its hell/glory) this film is the product and final example.A bad remake of a film on Oedipal themes that's been done a million times before (mainly by French ""auteurs"") ..with nothing redeeming about it. Facile, shallow characterizations of morally defunct and corrupt people mixed with lots of bad, cheesy sex scenes. I fast forwarded through some parts and then went back to see if I'd missed anything, and it was more of the same, disgusting, debasing interactions between sick people with no conscience or humanity.Felt like watching a serial killer's wet dream as a teenage boy, I feel dirty even writing this review.Don't waste your time, throw this one into the bin."
1,Don't bother,Total waste of time. Tedious and pretentious in the extreme and ultimately disgusting. This film is a good example of why French cinema has such a bad reputation in America.
3,My mother was nothing like this,"This has some very deviant moments in it. Take for instance a woman, her lover, and her son all sharing a taxi. Her lover sits between her and her son. The lover then reaches under the son, pokes her finger where the sun don't shine then sniffs her finger and lets the mother sniff it as they talk about how dirty he is.The lover then promises that her first kiss with the son is going to be where her finger was, and later, in front of the mother, she gives that promised kiss!Is this a 'message' film, and I just don't get the message?"
1,One star is one star too much,"If you liked this movie you may also try gazing into a stool and stirring and sniffing for 90 minutes. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if they'd come with a sequel based on one's obsession with their own stool. It's not that these 'complex thoughts' don't exist in the human mind, but are more properly dealt with in a medical office. Someone mentioned Oedipus? Give me a break."
1,forget it,How many times can I can that this really sucked? A complete total waste of time. Unless you are brain dead.
4,Interesting Study,"I found this movie very interesting. It reminded me of Michael Haneke(see The Piano Teacher) in the way it uses aspects of human sexuality and psychology that are generally percieved as being aberrant or taboo and presented them to the audiences in an unbridled, no holds barred fashion. It used peoples own insecurities to provoke a powerful response that was ultimately satisfying and thought provoking. The only drawback that I could find was that I felt the movie did not explore the issues that it presented deeply enough-the oedipal conflict, incestuous desires, and the taboo versus the accepted. Also, the film was something of a coming of age flick, which was interesting. It was just more of a study and less of a complete, fully realized work of art. If you are into indie french erotic films, then this is the place to go."
2,Very Dark and Depressing,"Usually I enjoy movies that deal with the human condition, but the darkness and depravity of this movie ruined the eroticism."
2,"Two stars on the stimulation scale, maybe three for the story as a whole","When her emotionally distant husband dies in a car crash, his widow introduces their son to her parallel life of sex clubs and all-night partying (I guess it was an open marriage), hoping to bring the poor boy out of his shell a little. Somewhat provocative and engaging story is undercut by too much philosophical rambling, a general air of seediness, and a downer ending. I'm not saying that those elements represent weaknesses of the movie, only that they'll prevent you from enjoying the film on anything other than an ""artistic"" level, if you're inclined to do so. In other words, this isn't an exciting movie about a sexy mom introducing her shy son to her sexy friends. Though there is a sexy mom and some sexy friends. So, if the mere presence of those elements- underused as they are- is enough for you, go for it. Myself, I felt the movie wasn't a total loss, but I did find myself looking at my watch once or twice."
3,Meh,"Although I did enjoy this movie, I found some parts of it hard to follow. I thought it was beautifully filmed, but I felt like many of the sex scenes were gratuitous , and frankly, borderline pornographic. The scene where the three young adults (er, the son, the girl, the weasely looking guy) did the whole bondage thing...it just didn't seem necessary.The ending was pretty hilarious though (I'm a bad person). This is a good film and all, but not the best to come out of France, it is also pretty disturbing."
2,Pretty silly and pointless,"If you like your characters morose and uninspiring, your sex joyless and twisted, then this might be your movie. I didn't care about the characters, and I sure didn't find any of their behavior interesting or sexy."
1,Bad copy,Copy I received was some kind of internal review copy with words to this effect on literally every frame of the movie.
3,A challenging film?,"Ma Mere is another exploring, indeed probing French film. It seems to be dealing with three challenges. First is the sensual mother. She loves her teenage son to the point of wanting him to experience the edges of erotic pleasure. The thing is, she wants to watch as well. The second challenge seems to be her own need for yet more. She leaves her son to experience other things, with her younger `femme fatale'. Yet he is not left alone; the final challenge. A companion is provided for him. Over time, revelations emerge. The film concludes with a consummation; one that will shake some and bemuse others. Yet, that is what challenging cinema is supposed to do, I think. At the very least, it illustrates some of the contortions of love.Ian Hunter.Author of `e-Love'."
4,Grave Sight,"Since I enjoyed Charlaine Harris's Sookie series so much, I thought I would try another of her series also. It is an interesting premise that the main character, Harper Connelly, can find dead bodies, but this series was not as much fun as the Sookie series. Harper was traumatized by the event that caused her unusual talent, and relies heavily on her step-brother for emotional support. As a mystery series, it is interesting, and some of Harper's wise cracks are amusing, but Harper's fragility was worrisome to me. I'll probably read the next book in the series before I write this series off."
3,Okay read...nothing great.,"If you're looking for the exciting and dangerous love story as Sookie Stackhouse series, you'll be disappointed. Though Harper exudes the similar writing stye of Charlaine Harris, the story is just okay...not boring but neither captivating. There isn't much of the ""Danielle Steele"" lust the Sookie series has either."
2,Not as impressive as her other work,"I read all of the Sookie Stackhouse books in about a week. I thought they were the most original and entertaining work I have read in quite a while. When I ran out of them, I moved on to this series thinking it would be just as good. I am sorry to say I was disappointed. While the characters are more realistic, the plot made no sense. I don't want to give it away, but I feel like Harris built up a good mystery only to provide a conclusion that had no thought. I'll probably read the next one just to see if it gets any better just because I liked the vampires so much."
4,Introducing a new heroine,"I was intrigued by the concept of someone who can ""read the dead"", and it falls right in to Harris' favorite fictional devices. When you let yourself get over the concept that it isn't Sookie Stackhouse and it has a more serious bent (very little humor), you can enjoy it for what it is: a good, quick read and an interesting premise."
3,Good but not Sookie,"I enjoy the Southern Vampire series and in fact am rereading them right now. These new characters are ok but not really that interesting. The ""brother""/""sister"" thing is a bit offsetting as well as the over-dependancy for Tolliver. This book has a good premise but needs work to make it on par with the SV series. Hopefully, with a little tweaking it can be improved. The basic story line is great, needs something more."
3,Grave Sight,I was fairly disappointed in this book. It was definitely darker in tone than the Southern Vampire Series and lacked its humor and charm. I really had to work at reading the whole book. I prefer her Sookie Stackhouse books and hope that her next effort for this series is better.
1,disappointing,"Hated it! Harper is no Sookie and no fun. What a dark dreary, almost uninteresting read. There were no characters you could like. Harper and Tolliver were uncaring and clueless about their true feelings. Will not read any more of this series. Bring back Sookie!"
2,Dull and boring!,This was the first Harper story I read and it was dull. I enjoyed the Sookie story series. I won't be buying any more stories with this character. She just bored me and was pretty pathetic.
5,Attention Charlaine Harris Fans!,"Charlaine Harris has found creative Texas T bubbling in her brain yet again with her new heroine, Harper Connelly. Harper was struck by lightning as a teenager, and with the support of her pseudo-brother Tolliver, she finds dead bodies through a psychic-like sense. Fans of her darker Lily Bard series will enjoy the touch of dry wit and fans of the slightly lighter Sookie Stackhouse novels will appreciate Harper's unique supernatural situation. With her hint of romance, thick mystery, and sense of humor, I personally will be enjoying this series for as long as Harris chooses to write it."
5,Gravely Entertaining,"Female character that has a difference that makes her all the more remarkable. Her gift causes as much problems as it solves, but she is the better (as is almost everyone involved) for it!"
3,Passive heroine,"Unlike the lead characters in Ms. Harris' other books, Harper is somewhat passive. I found the characters believable and interesting, but I can understand how others who have read the book found them annoying or a bit dull.The story is quite dark, like the later Sookie Stackhouse plots.Maybe not for everyone, but I am glad I jumped into this paranormal series."
4,Supernatural Whipped Cream,"Charlaine Harris has such a fun, light style of writing. If you like her Sookie Stackhouse novels because of their wit and sarcasm as well as their creatures, then you can read the Harper Connelly books for dessert. So, grab a couple scoops of frozen Cool Whip, and settle down in your favorite chair, and prepare to enjoy a slightly altered reality for a couple hours.FYI, for such a quick read, Charlaine provides superior character development and sound geographical references. And if you read with an open mind, she finds a way to poke fun at all the bigots in the world, without offending anyone in particular.Hope you enjoy it as much as I did. I will certainly be reading the follow-up books."
4,grave sight,"This book lacks the supernatural element in the Sookie books, but it was still a very driven mystery. I enjoyed it, but I felt the ending was too predictable. I didn't feel any real buildup in suspense. I enjoyed learning about Harper and Tolliver more than the acutual mystery. I would definitely recommend this book to any fan of Charlaine Harris."
4,fairly good,"I too read this b/c of vampire series. I expected this to be different, and it is. I liked the grimmer heroine but found the plot predictable. I figured out who the killer was by page 5, but I kept reading anyway b/c the book was enjoyable. I also found the romance lackluster, but that too was okay b/c Harris' eye for atmosphere kept me reading."
3,Grave Sight.,"It was okey, but I'd skip pages to get on with the story, To me it wasn't a hang on every word book"
2,Not My Favorite,"I usually enjoy Charlaine Harris so much, and was excited to read a new series. I did finish this book, but I never connected with the characters. The story wasn't edgy enough. The characters weren't charming or funny. I had a difficult time making myself finish, secretly hoping something wonderfully exciting would happen and save the story. This one is definately not my favorite Harris book. Don't waste the time, just re-read one of the Sookie Stackhouse books, it's much more fun!"
4,Really Great Reading,"Harper is a very interesting heroine. I really enjoyed this book. It is by far not on the level with some of her other works, because I have found a lot of inconsistencies in this series. I have to say though it is a great quick read and interesting."
2,Very dark,"This is a very dark book-even darker than the Lily Bard series. I have always enjoyed Ms. Harris' books-especially the humor and characterizations of the characters. None of that was present in this book-it was populated with deeply negative characters and the storyline itself was negative and depressing.I found the intense-and borderline psychotic-neediness and dependency of Harper to be very unattractive and unsettling. I, like previous reviewers, just don't like weak, needy women."
3,just so-so,"I am a huge fan of Harris' Sookie Stackhouse series and her Shakespere series. I bought this book expecting to be equally thrilled. I am pretty dissapointed in it.The book is good-it just isn't great, which is what I have come to expect from Mrs. Harris. The who-done-it is fairly easy to figure out early on and there really isn't much suspense in the book. I picked up on some possible sexual tension between the two main characters. Honestly they ARE step brother and sister...but it is still kind of creepy.All in all I was dissappointed with this book and don't reccommend it as a hardback buy."
2,not what I'm used to from Harris,"While this book about a woman who can sense dead bodies and see the how they died, is from one of my favorite authors, I have to agree that it didn't keep my attention like her ""Dead"" series. I agree with most reviewers, that I was uncomfortable with the relationship she has with her stepbrother. I know they depend on each other, but I thought at any minute they can jump each other and it gives me the creep out factor. The book was an easy read, but I wasn't sure I enjoyed the experience. If this is the beginning of a new series, I'll probably wait until it comes out on paperback before picking it up. I came away from this book not really caring about the main character, unlike Sookie ( who I can't get enough of!). Sorry, just not a great book overall."
2,Not Great,"I've read all of Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse books and although the first book was a little hard to get through, they continued to get much better and I loved the series as a whole. So I was excited to start on this series even after reading some not-so-great reviews. I was not impressed...at all. It started out good. I had high hopes. But the bad guy was soooooooooooo obvious right from the beginning. The jail time story line was a page filler at best. This book is not terribly long to begin with and it could have been cut in half without losing any important information. I enjoyed the two main characters, Harper and her brother. I plan to read the next book in this series hoping that they will improve like the sookie stackhouse series did. But this book was a disappointment."
2,Grave reading.,"I found this book hard to stay with. It was dull, boring, and I had the killer and the plot figured out before I was half way through the book. Such a disappointment after reading the Sookie books."
5,Good read!,The book Grave Sight by Charline Harris is a really good mystery book. I love the charters in it and I love the twists and turns in the book!
4,Grave Sight,This book is overall really good. It was slow off to start with and I actually wasn't sure if I was going to finished it but I started reading more of it I couldn't put it down until I was done with it. Will be buying the other books in the series
1,I'm glad i didn't buy it,"This book did not live up to my expectations of the author. I really enjoy the Southern Vampire books, and this was no where near as entertaining. The story is plodding,even the action is monotone, the characters have lots of potential, but are dimly painted and i just couldn't care for them, the plot is predictable, the motives obvious but unrealistic, a blatant knockoff of Laurell K Hamilton's Anita Blake...all in all this was a sad attempt at mystery writing. This book gave me so little, i can't even give more of a review. If you must read it, please borrow from the library."
2,Not my cup of tea...,"Coming with great enthusiasm from the sookie books, I was hoping to find an equally as good series to start reading. Although the book is well-written and interesting to those who enjoy this stuff,this genre just doesn't do it for me. It's more detective story than I expected, and it was slow-goin' for me. This Sookie fan was disappointed. P.S.- there is nothing romantic about this book. At all. And no sexual tension between the two main characters."
1,Uggghhhh...,"What a bunch of drivel...the main character couldn't have a drier, more uninteresting personality if she were a soda cracker! Beyond being totally predictable as a mystery, the rude, dismissive, and completely cold and colorless attitudes of the two ""siblings"" made this book almost unreadable. Why should the reader care about anything in this book when the humorless main character barely can bring herself to care acout anything but herself? The characters in this book, with the possible exception of the policeman, are ridiculously flat and self absorbed. I've never felt the need to write a review before, but I couldn't let go of the irritation that felt reading this. The most irritating thing about it is that it could have been executed so much better by an author who even pretended to appreciate her readers by inserting even an ounce of personality into her characters. I felt like I needed to wash the dust off my hands after reading this formulaic and shallow piece of...work."
2,Snoozzzzz,"One thing that I have to say is that it is a fast read. Besides that the book is a total letdown. First off, I kept reading it thinking it is going to get more interesting but sadly it did not. The characters are extremely uninteresting and undeveloped. The main character was hit by lightening at a young age and now can sense the dead. Besides that, that is truly all we learn about her. Oh and she has a strange fascination with her brother. Then the book takes place in the most boring town that sets the backdrop for the whole book. And lastly, you know who did it from the very beginning but you keep reading in order to find out why he did it. And the reason on why he did it is not even that plausible. I am truly sad to say that I read this book."
1,Looking for the next Sookie or Bella?,"I am book worm in a readers block. I loved the Sookie Stackhouse Series and enjoyed Twilight. I am an avid reader and have been downloading sample of some books for the last 2 weeks. I decided to give a try to Charline Harries first book of the series Grave Sight. I must say that at the point I reached 50% exactly on my Kindle I started screaming in frustration. I figured out the answer to the obvious mystery. I would not recommend this book, if you are looking to continue after Sookie or Bella, it's a very fast pace book with a bunch of filling in between pages. Charlaine is a great writer it's a fast read and its not a heavy book, but honestly it's a very weak mystery."
3,Good but predictable.,"I liked this book because I had read all of Charlaine's Sookie stuff, even the Sookie-verse short stories. I wanted to keep reading her stuff, so I gave this one a chance first because it had a supernatural twist. I found it to be a good read, but it was a little simple in a childlike way and way too predictable at times. However, this is her first book in the series, so I knew it would take a while for Charlaine to get into her characters and flow. The books get better as they go, so give this one a chance so you can start the series."
4,"Great story, very interesting","As a fan of the Sookie Stackhouse novels, I am a big fan of Charlaine Harris. Though I'm not really a mystery book fan, I really enjoyed this book. Charlaine has a way to draw you into her books so that you can't put them down. She is a fantastic writer and I am so glad that I found her. It is because of writers like her that I got into reading in the first place."
4,Pleasant surprise,"Hopefully I won't offend the author when I say I had never heard of her before about a week ago, but now I'm very glad I have. I really found this first novel in the series a good read, it piqued my interest so much so that I had a hard time stopping reading. I purchased it for my Kindle and as soon as I finished it, went back and got book #2 and I haven't regretted either one."
4,Good Start to a Good Series,I've actually read all 3 books in this series but thought I would put a review here to help others pick up these books. I'm a HUGE Sookie Stackhouse fan and these books are not as amazing as the Southern Vampire Mysteries but they are good enough to get into. After reading book 3 I am definitely hooked for however many CH decides to write. Interesting characters and good plots. Give it at least 2 books and then you will want to read book 3 and soon 4 which comes out in October 09.
4,Great summer read,"I enjoyed this book quite a bit. I initially began with the Sookie Stackhouse novels, so naturally I wanted more. That said, I was hoping this would fit the bill. Though it is a fun and entertaining read, I'm certainly not addicted in the same way. Either way, if you're a fan of Charlaine Harris you should like this."
1,This is NOT a Sookie Stackhouse....,"I love Charlaine's Sookie Stackhouse series. Based on the love of that series, I decided to give this series a chance. Sadly, this series is such the same story over and over again, with some small changes here and there. I read 3 books from this series and the last one made me yawn.Not that much fun."
3,A little disappointing,"From the description and other reviews, I was picturing something somewhere between Agatha Christie and LKH. It fell WAY closer to Agatha Christie, however, and was a fairly predictable run of the mill mystery."
2,A difficult character to like,"Like many other reviewers, I'm a fan of the Sookie Stackhouse series. You get sexy vampires, violent murders, comedy, and Sookie. Sookie is the main reason to enjoy the series; she's just such a likable gal, despite everything.Not so Harper, the protagonist of this series. She's depressed (or seems to be), deeply cynical, and just plain negative. In real life I find these sorts of people draining. OK, so maybe it makes for a well-rounded character of depth, but really, is such a person enjoyable to be around?I think I'm going to skip the rest of the series and try one of Harris' other books."
3,Grave Sight,"As a avid fan of Charlaine Harris, I grabbed this book and looked forward to being entertained. Well, yes I enjoyed the book; however, the story wasn't as adhesive as her novels usually are. This is understandable as she is beginning a new series, but I hope the sequel has more substance to it. Her characters are well shaped; but repeating the same ground very times was irrating. While I was disappointed by several parts of the story, I eagerly look forward to the sequel and hope Ms Harris is back to her old self next time."
5,Kept me interested!,I wasn't sure that I would like these books. I read all of the Sookie Stackhouse books and watched True Blood on HBO. I started reading these and I am already on the third book!! Love them!!
4,Nice Surprise,After accidentally purchasing this book I was pleased at how enjoyable the read was. There were a few typos but nothing that took away from the read.
5,"Fascinating premise, great character","I loved every book in this series; if you like the paranormal, with some maybe-actual-science and good mystery thrown in, you will appreciate these books."
5,Keeper Shelf Material,"The books that Charlain Harris writes have been ending up on my keeper shelf for years. This new book seems to be keeping right up with her older series for entertainment value, so if you like your mysteries with a bit of paranormal spice, this one will fit right in. I enjoyed it very much and will be looking for more in the series."
3,3.75 Stars,"While lacking in the humor and warmth that the Southern Vampire series has, this first entry in Harris' potential new series was still a page-turner. At least after the first two chapters were over, that is. The heroine of the story has the power to 'listen to the dead' and finds bodies of deceased people by following their call. An interesting idea, and one that I wasn't sure could hold up over an entire novel. To Harris' credit, she pulled off the mystery, and was wise enough to keep it under 300 pages. I was intrigued enough to read the whole book, but found plenty of material skippable, especially near the end, which seemed padded with extra details.I will try another book in the series if one comes out, but won't be disappointed if it doesn't."
2,Had to DIG DEEP to finish this book!,"After reading Harris' Sookie and Aurora series, I was excited to meet Harper. I will NOT be reading another Harper book. The plot was lame - through the entire book the reader finds themselves asking ""WHY are you staying in this town???"" Then, Harper and her brother finally decide to leave, only to agree to a last meeting with the townsfolk. The meeting is predictably a trap that Harper manages to escape from.If you are dimwitted you will like this book."
2,No Sookie Stackhouse,"Harper is no Sookie. I love the Sookie Stackhouse books, and was excited to read these, but I had to force my way through Grave Sight. Harper is whiney and moody and all she ever wants to do is ""get out of this town"". Tolliver, her brother is not any better.These characters definitely don't have much appeal. I read the 3rd book first and liked it better. Mainly because there was some relationship tension between the 2 characters.I wasn't entertained."
4,Good mystery...,"This was a nice, easy light read. I tried to read Harris's other series with Sookie, where the HBO series True Bllod is based off of, but it was too strange. The character in this series, Harper Connolly, has the ability to find dead bodies and identify how they died. Harris's writing flows well and she can tell a great story. The ability this character has is almost believable and not as strange as her other books. I recommend this to other mystery readers."
4,I liked it better...,"I have read all of the sookie novels and really enjoyed them, but this was better. It actually made me want to try a couple of her other books. I hope this series is long running!"
3,Chillingly odd...,"This was a very different story from an author that has always stood out. Best known for her Sookie Stackhouse series, Harris gives us a new tale about a woman who was struck by lightning and given the gift of sensing the dead. She uses this creepy power as her livelyhood, finding lost bodies, clarifying the last moments of the deceased and how they actually died.Harper, our main character, has travelled to Sarne, Missouri with her stepbrother, Tolliver, whom she seems to have a somewhat creepy attachment to. She does her job and tries to leave only to find herself drawn into Sarne's dramas. Tolliver is imprisoned on trumped up charges, her flings wifes death isn't solved, and some one keeps trying to kill her. Not you average work week but one that Harper will have to work through to solve the mystery of what's going on in small town Sarne and get on with her life with the afterlife."
1,ewww....,"I didn't care much for the book at all. Infact, I can't really think of anything I did like about it. I didn't care much for Harper's character. I found her annoying and her reaction towards her brother's one night stands are somewhat creepy. Tolliver wasn't much better. He travels all over with his sister and picks up waitresses. I got bored with Harper's story of being struck by lightening repeated again and again and again. I had a difficult time getting into it since I disliked the two main characters and found their overly close relationship rather creepy."
4,Kept me reading,"After reading Charlaine Harris' Sookie series, I wasn't sure she could keep me interested in another heroine. Harper is interestingly portrayed and I was anxious to get back to my book. Since I love to read about vampires,paranormal activity, and any super powers on the common person, this book fit the bill. I think Charlaine is an exceptional writer. I like how her mind works."
1,This series(and book) are both confusing and going downhill,"I have a question. In this book it says Trib is a buckskin. But the cover, and parts of the book, has him as a paint. I hope that the series will come back. Sammy, Cindy, Max, Heather, Tor, Mandy, and Asheigh. You're proboly thinking, hey, Ash is in the book? She isn't! This is not the same Ash! Joanna, please oh please come back and make the series about racing!"
1,Christina is SUCH a brat!!!!!,"Ok, look I totally LOVED the book Ashleigh's Christmas Miracle because besides that book just being all around great, I really admired Christina in that book.....she was brave, nice and not bratty. I liked her attitude in that book. So then I heard about these books coming out in the series about her and I was really excited and I started reading them and really DISLIKING them. Christina has SUCH a bad attitude and she's so bratty, stuck-up and spoiled. So either they change Christina's attitude or get the books back to racing....and if they don't then the TB series has just lost another customer! So change the series so your readers can enjoy the books again!!!!!!"
3,Okay,"Okay, so I haven't read this book yet but I wanted o say something. I think the new charachters are cool and everything, but what happened to the old ones? Especially Cindy???She wasn't exactly my favourite charachter but all of a sudden in number 24 she had suddenly dissapered!So had Len, the old barn manager. What happened to him??? Did he die??? I'd like to know. What happened to Cindy??? And what about Sammy??? Did she ever marry Tor???"
1,What Happened Here?,"I haven't read this book, and I don't plan to! What has happened to this series? It was set up perfectly when Glory's Joy was born, and I thought Honor Bright was going to make a good star. But it didn't get far enough to reach full potential! Is this series up for sale, and whatever crappy ""author"" wants it can buy it and write a few books, until they are booed down from their pedistol by their ""adoring"" fans? The series used to be mediocre, in my opinion, but it has progressed to downright INSULTING! Don't expect me to waste over four dollars on what is worth only the paper its printed on! The awful ""Thoroughbred"" series has just lost yet another customer!"
1,Another Camp Book,"In this book, Melanie has to win the last show of the session at Camp Saddlebrook. Otherwise her dad will take her home. Lately, lots of wierd things have happening and Melanie's been blamed. Can Melanie prove to her dad that she has changed before he takes her back to New York for good?"
3,boring...,"This book was OKay. I like the tint of mystery to it. I think it adds spark. But it's kind of slow and easy to put down. That's why I didn't give it five stars like I usually do. Don't get me wrong, I still recommend reading it because if you skip it you might get confused in Dylan's Choice, the next one. I'm just saying it isn't as great as it should be."
2,They are getting a little better....not enough though,"I have to agree with everyone, the books are hard to write. I have written 3 short stories, titled- ""The Black Colt"", ""You Killed My Sister, the Devil Shall Kill You"", and the third isn't titled yet.Also, these books do haev some mistakes in them. Like when Princess got hurt and in book #16, page38 and 39, last line on pg 38 and 1st 3 paragraphs on 93 were saying that Ashleigh didn't want to ride another horse in the Derby except for Princess, but Ashleigh was NOT Princess's jockey. There were a lot of mistakes in all of the ""new"" books, expecially the ""newer"" ones- like 23 and up.all in all this book was ok, though very predictialbe. The only charater that I don't like is Christina- but only at times.hopefully the books will get better. If anyone wants to talk bout them e-mail me at LuvTBracin@aol.com (love thoroughbred racing)"
2,Shut up!!,"All of you stupid people who are dissin' Melanie should look at this more closely. Melanie is a girl who was bad just to get attention since she got so little at home with her father. As you can see if you really read these books she is trying to clean up her act. I only gave this book 2 stars because I haven't read it yet. I miss Joanna as much or more than the rest of you but I believe that we need to give these books a chance. I really loved the books about Cindy and Max and I want to know exactly how their relationship turned out. I would love it if either Joanna Cambell or Karen Bently came back they were both extremely good writers, well the more I think about it I liked Karen Bently better 'cause she gave the books more feeling and emotion. I actually cried when Cindy and Max fought, that's how good she was. Okay I just wanted to say to stop dissin' Melanie. Good-Bye."
3,Jumping Is Better!,"I am so glad that this series has moved on to jumping and doesn't have as much racing. I am 16 years old, but I still read this series because I love horses and I compete in jumping. In my opinion, jumping is more fun and more exciting than racing, so I really enjoy reading about Christina. But, these books don't focus as much on horses as they used to. Now the books are only about personal problems, like this book, # 28, and # 30. But because I like jumping, I'll continue to read this series, and hope it will get better. Also, what happened to Dylan? And Cindy and Glory? I never thought they fit in to the story, but where did they go? ( )."
1,It STUNK!!!,I used to be a faithful TB fan. All I can say is that I hope some major changes will be made. Where did everybody go? What happenend? WHY DID IT HAPPEN?!!! Who cares what happens to Melanie? I don't. Open ur eyes and realize before this mistake is made again.
1,Not as good as Camp Saddlebrook,"What happened??? Camp Saddlebrook was the best and then it dropped into the toliet! You lost your touch! Camp Saddlebrook was the absoulte best, but this one just fell off the cliff! No good! Mel needs to have her pesky attuide and funny fever, like she did in #28, but she lost that all in #29. I have to say this book is not on my #1 book list. I own all of the Thoroughbred series, and this one just makes stop and wonder if it was really worth it and will it still be worth it. Also I still think Christina is and always will be a brat. What kind of kid cries when she gets a horse on Christmas and her birthday, just because it's a racehorse and not her dream eventer? Come on! Get Real!"
2,Better,"I think the reason Melanie books are better then Christina ones are because Melanie is not a brat. The author does do a good job conveying Melanie's distress at being wrongly accused of all the pranks. I miss the horse racing aspect of this series, and I'm glad to read it will be coming back. In an answer to a reader who asked why I love Joanna Campbell so much: I don't like Karen Bently because her writing was too happy and the horses were always wining. Cindy was obessed with wining. I don't like this new series of authors, not because they are bad writers, but because they failed to follow the story line and added a whole set of new characters without telling us what happened to the new ones. When Mrs. Campbell comes back, she'll at least know whats going on. I know maybe her books will be as bad as the rest, but hey, anything can happen."
1,Campbell is not writing these books,"There is another writer, which we all know will be fired in a few months like all the others. You would think that they would find a REAL writer and not a jumping instructor. Joanna Campbell will write THREE books that come out in AUGUST. If the new writer reads these book reviews, WHY DIDN'T YOU READ THE SERIES?!!!! WHY DON'T YOU RESEARCH? It isn't hard to write about racing. Anyone can do it. Why do you have to go and write about what you think you know? Geez, that's selfish. The world doesn't need another jumping series, but I guess that is what we have now isn't it? Why don't you want to be original? Are you scared? Did you think that you can't handle it? What is the reason? Why jumping and eventing and camp! of all things? Why couldn't you bring the readers back? The one's that left when it suddenly went to eventing? Didn't you hear? I know that you didn't change the series to jumping but the series is still eventing and I am one of the ex-readers."
2,have not read it,"Ihave not read this book, and don't need to. Thoroughbred was a wonderful series, it was about racing, not jumping. This new author is awful. What happened to Samantha, Tor, Cindy, Max, Mandy, Tor and Sam's baby, Len?? The Saddle Club books are for jumping and eventing, thats what made Thoroughbred so different from every thing else. WHERE IS JOANNA CAMPBELL????"
1,JOANNA COME BACK,Why are all of these other authors ruining the Thoroughbred series. Please Joann come back and pick up the story where you left us.
3,GET TO THE GOOD STUFF,"This auther stinks.- I WANT JOANNA CAMPBELL- They should get Snot Faced Melanie out of the picture. And get back to racing and Whitebrook. There was 1 race in Melanie's Treasure, its ruining the books- they are supposed to be about racing. And Melanie as making Christina look bad! Does anyone know what happened to CINDY????"
3,I do not like the way Allison Estes writes!,"I really hate the way this new author writes. I hope Joanna Campbell sees all these reviews and starts writing the TB books again!!! Just about everyone dislikes the new author. JOANNA CAMPBELL, PLEASE COME BACK!!!!"
3,I Hope Not,I hope this is Melanie's Last book I Hate her. Get Joanna Back. Get Allison out of hear she stinks.
4,GREAT!!,"I really liked this book. The story line was good and i loved the suspense. I do think it concentrates a little much on the people, not the horses, however, and the racing ones are the BEST. i really reccomend this book, though."
2,why cant we buy from canada,I think these lights are great but you cant find a recomnded trainformer for them or order them from canada
1,Huh? Where did you learn to measure?,"The fixture looks very nivce, but your measurements leave me confused. According to your description, this fixture ""Measures 32.5"" in length, 15.5"" in width and 4.75"" in height.""If this is 4.75 inches high, what good will it do for lighting my sidewalk? And if it is only 4.75 inches high, what are the other measurements listed.Do I have to lay the fixture (or myself) on its side to measure it? This method will probably be useful after I trip in the dim light it casts from 4.75 inches above the sidewalk, and I want to get all of the correct information immediately into my lawyer's hands.Does anyone edit your information? Can I trust the remainder of what you print???"
5,Angel Shannon Is A Treasure,Angel Shannon shows her multiple talents here.She can hold her own with anyone in English letters.I'm writing this note in the hope that she sees this and continues this level of excellence.
4,Just what I was looking for!,"This book is an excellent source of information for any cook looking for schools or educational programs, whether at the professional level or just for fun. Information is separated by Career/Professional Programs versus Recreational Programs and is indexed by state and country. It includes costs and contact information. Only additional piece of information I would have liked would have been assessments or recommendations on quality of the programs offered."
5,works far better than expected,"This was the best purchase I've made in a long time. 12 bucks to restore my ipod 3rd gen to it's old lively condition. I now get to use my ipod all day long and some rather than it dying upon hitting ""play"", when not plugged in. Replacing the battery saved me from buying a new crappy mp3 player that i would like less than my ipod and therefor about $100. not bad!i got my ipod open in about 20 seconds. it was fairly easy to install. but then again ive dropped my ipod a few times and it's popped open before. but you probably have too. stays shut just fine. the instructions are adequate aa are the tools. but i also used my thumb nail a bit to start.you really should buy this if the only thing wrong with your ipod is the battery. dont buy new crap when your old crap just needs a little love."
5,Amazing stories of great places,"""Solving Sprawl"" made me want to live in the places the authors describe. For my job, I typically have to read a lot of dry, boring reports and books about planning and policy. By providing great, color photos and true stories about how many of these places were created, I couldn't put this book down. ""Solving Sprawl"" does something that many people have tried, but few have done this well: it makes the businness of creating more livable communities interesting and engaging. Suddenly, smart growth isn't just something I read about happening in some far away place, it's something that can happen in my town, or anywhere.If you are interested in how to make your community a better place to live without being bored to tears with ""legalese"" and ""policy wonk talk,"" buy this book!!!"
4,eternity ring,"The customer service with this company was fantastic, and I am very happy with my purchase. I have to admit, though, it looked a little more antiqued online in the photo, and I'd have preferred that appearance. That said, I wear this ring every day and have received numerous compliments!"
4,Shines good but kind of uncomfortable,"This ring is really thin, perfect for small hands like mine. The workmanship of this ring is so-so, but it's so small that it doesn't matter(you really have to look real close to see it). It is a good ring to wear during the day, it has a ""feel"" to it like when you are wearing platinum, but it's borderline discomfort that I have to take it off during night time so i can go to sleep. It shines alot. I told my boyfriend I wont mind this being my wedding band in the future. (it's a promise ring for now.. haha)."
4,Beutiful vintange but bulky,"I LOVE the looks and shine of this eternity vintage ring!! I found it a little too bulky is best to order a biger size because if u order your size it will bother your other fingers if ur always gonna have it in a middle finger. But thats just me, i like thin rings.Thats why i did no give 4 stars."
2,This is no walk in the park...,"I am an avid reader of Jane Austen and the main reason is her use of wit and empowered female characters. Unfortunately, Mansfield Park has neither of these. It is touted as one of Austen's most ""complex"" and ""intricately plotted"" works. I enjoy the sense of fun that is so evident in most of her novels, and perhaps, I simply find Mansfield Park to dark for my taste. I could not relate to the main character, Fanny, who, in my opinion, was an extremely naive ninny.While I pleasurably breeze through Austen's other novels in an afternoon, I found Mansfield Park took me several days to read, because of the breaks I took when I became bored with the story. (Something which has never happened to me with any other of her books.) This novel is not a style I find appealing, but, who knows, you just might enjoy it."
3,Not Austen's best,"Jane Austen is unquestionably one of the most talented writers ever, but Mansfield Park is not up to par with the rest of her works. To put it quite bluntly, Mansfield Park is boring. The number one cause is the weak heroine Fanny Price, who doesn't measure up to Elizabeth Bennett or Emma Woodhouse. The spark and vivacity that Austen's other protagonists have simply isn't there. Austen still wields the English language like a true master, but the plot isn't vibrant enough. Austen only published six novels so Mansfield Park is worth reading for an Austen fan, but I wouldn't recommend it to the casual reader."
3,A really long walk,"Ok, I'll admit it right here. I skipped to the end of the book. But how could I help it? Between Edmund's confused love-life and Fanny's martyrdom, we were getting no where. It's like in one of those movies where you yell at the characters ""Just TALK to each other!""Do you like the tv show Felicity? Then this is the book for you. Here you have two people who totally understand each other. They're soul mates. Yet they just can't seem to get together. The very characteristics that make them so right for each other are the walls that separate them. I have a feeling that Jane Austen was tired of being so nice and then getting the bad end of the bargain. Maybe writing this book was some kind of outlet for her. And she must have had LOTS of free time on her hands when she wrote this.So if you have lots of free time on your hands, and you're a die-hard Austen fan like me, go ahead. Take the challenge. See if you can make it all the way through Mansfield Park!"
2,Certainly not one of her best works,"Generally a fan of Austin's writing, I was surprised at the dullness and ineptness of the text. The story dragged on leading the frustrated reader in no direction. Do not recommend this as a first Austin read."
2,"Dull, dull, dull","While this book touches upon the society of English countryside gentry and their sexist, classist and patriarchical lives, it is quite dull. The plot drags and the characters, though their personalities are developed, don't do much. Nothing interesting happens until the last 50 pages or so. Overall, a good book to fall asleep with."
3,School readings,"Mansfield Park is a classic. Again, it is not the easiest read to follow but it is a good story."
3,Price of Fame in the 17th Century,"Mansfield Park, a novel of Austen, focuses on love in soceity. Austen proves that love certainly overcomes all. Fanny, the protagonist, faces many barriers that affect her life and overall existence. She is from a poor family and is now living with her wealthy aunt. She is in love with her cousin, Edmund, and is faced with a dilemma of making him happy while not trying to be with him. The status of wealth and poverty places one's position in society. Austen, on this rare occasion, adds a divorce to add more drama to this romantic plot. The novel is a long tedious one but it has a signficant impact to all those who read it. If you love Jane Austen this is a DEFINITE MUST BUY."
2,the worst book of my favorite author,"Fanny Price is the poor, orphaned girl who virtually serves as a servant in her wealthy cousins' house. Only her cousin Edmund Bertram treats her even remotely as an equal, even though she is of a higher moral character and behaves with greater refinement than they. When newcomers (brother and sister Henry and Mary Crawford) come to town, they charm the Bertrams. But the Crawfords are shameless and lead various members of the family into ruin.I read this book for the first time in either high school or college. I found Fanny so preachy and pallid as to be unpalatable. Even after re-reading (I thought, ""Am I missing something?""), I hated the drab main character so much that I can't find one nice thing to say about the book. Read any other Austen book--they are all delightful."
5,Fantastic,"Great quality, love the penguins hardback classics. You won't regret buying these, worth every penny.A great gift as well for any reader, especially a Jane Austen fan."
4,Nice and comfortable,Another Jane Austen that I like to read on occasion. It is romantic and has a predictable ending. Recommended for romantics.
5,easy and entertaining,This was an easy read and the characters were great. I do love Jane austen. The book in its description of places and people make it come to life. It would make a great movie.
3,Not my favorite.,"I finished this one many weeks back now and have struggled to find something to say about it. If you are looking for a book by Austen, I think you can skip this one unless you must read all of it. Here, Jane's characters reach their most insipid form and the author has them expending their time and energy in search of minutia. The book could have lost 1/3 of its size and the story would not have suffered.At the same time, the novel's back story might contain her best example of the worst parts in Regency gentry life. So, if you read Austen was as a critic or satirist primarily, you might find something here. Just look past the main character and her interests to find it.Her language is, as always, wonderful."
4,A little slow-but it sure picks up!,"I read many novels, many of them classics in under a week. This one took me a MONTH! I found the beginning to be extremely slow, but the book did pick up in the end. I can't really decide whether or not I liked Fanny, but she did need a little self-confidence. Edmund seemed a little too good to be true, and Aunt Norris was a total witch. I had a hard time believing the character relationships in this book as they seemed impossible because the people were HORRIBLE to eachother. Also, Uncle Bertram seemed to have a complete reformation that was a little unbelievable. I dragged through this book until it picked up at the end. I was sad to see it end, and I think Austen could have devoted more than 2 pages to Fanny and Edmund's romance at the end because it took so long to happen, though who am I to be a critic, I could never write anything close to Jane Austen! Read this book for the ending, but don't expect it be a fast read!"
4,Mansfield park,I thought the book was very good. It was my first read by this author and I will continue to read her other novels. I did at times get lost in her sometimes long conversations and I would have to back track a little to see who was talking or being talked about. Overall I would recommend this book and enjoyed it very much.
2,Not Jane's best work,"Having read Jane Austen's novels numerous times, I realize why Mansfield Park is so forgetable. While the story takes place during the same era of her other novels, this novel was not as exciting. It was an effort to read through to the end. I found it a rather laborious read, in that, friendship between Fanny and Bertram was the only emotion with no undertones that give Jane's other novels more depth and romance. The other characters were colorful and/or eccentric, however,the story was rather dull. The ending is also underwhelming. I just didn't find it as engaging as Pride and Prejudice and Emma."
5,One of Austen's best,"I have read all of Austen's works and ""Mansfield Park"" is one of the best. I could usually feel for the main character, Fanny Price, and relate to her. By loving her cousin Edmund so completely, she suffered greatly when Mary Crawford drew his attention and admiration. I would have been rather angry if I were Fanny been left sitting alone for a whole hour while they walked through the woods. Mr. Crawford's love of Fanny rather surprised me, because he didn't deserve her after flirting so mercilessly with her cousins. I was a glad that there was a happy ending. I believe the most satisfying reads (like those by Jane Austen) always have happy endings."
1,"I love Jane Austin, but ....","I really couldn't get into this one for some reason. Maybe I'll pick it up later and give it another try, I just found it so boring.."
1,"Good Descriptions, No Plot","I found when reading this book the story strayed from it's main character, Fanny, and went on for several pages, and sometimes entire chapters, about points which are irrelevant to the story. I also found the writer using excessively long sentances, and drawing out passages which could have easily been put in many less words.I also found that the story seemingly goes nowhere. There is little or no character change, and there really is no conflict in the story line.So if you want a dro pdead boring story with no action whatsoever, read on, dear reader, read on."
5,The best of Jane Austen,"I have read all of Jane Austen's book and think this one is the best! You will fall in love with all the charactors especially Edmund. He proves to be a true, honest, wonderful, gentleman. They have yet to make a movie of it that compares to the book!"
3,My least favorite Austen novel,"Mansfield Park is probably my least favorite of Austen's works. I disliked or felt indifferent about most of the characters in the book for most of the story, and while it does have some themes which could be considered important for the times, I felt that those same themes were treated better in some of Austen's other novels."
2,Not one of Jane Austen's best,"I am a huge fan of classic novels. I had to read Pride & Prejudice for English Lit in high school and I've been hooked ever since. I've read several of Austen's novels and I had trouble making to the end of this one. I felt like throwing the book down in frustration several times because it was so slow and hard to follow. Fanny was too quiet for my taste and I never understood Edmund's interest in Miss Crawford. If you're a fan of Jane Austen, go ahead and read this book, but make sure your wide awake, otherwise you might just fall asleep due to boredom."
5,Her masterpiece?,"This is Jane Austen's most difficult and least sparkling book. It is also, however, very possibly her best. Nowhere else do we see Austen treat immorality and its consequences as she does here. Her ""villians"" are usually laughable. Here, they are pitiable and deceitful. Fanny Price is certainly not a very entertaining character, but she is a very compelling one. As for those people who say that she is weak, they are correct. She uses all of her strength, however, to her advantage. Yet, she never does anything which would violate her strict moral code. Nowhere is Austen's keen insight into English social structure moral visible than in this ambiguous and moving tale. A wonderful, yet very difficult, book. Read her others first, then, when you think you know who Jane Austen was, read this. You'll be amazed."
3,Meandering and Pointless,This book goes on a long time without ever really getting to the point. The main characters are do-goody and self-righteous and you won't find any of the clever banter from other Jane Austin books like Pride and Prejudice. It's boring. Avoid it.
3,Dissapointment,"Don't get me wrong- I love Jane Austen. And thats the reason I gave the book 3 stars. But this is not her best book. Is not because it's too long, Emma is longer, but is a lot of talking, and she doesnt develop Fanny and edmund relationship enough. they fall in love and get married in the last two paragraphs. I sincerely didnt like it. I only finish it because Jane Austen is my favorite author."
3,Ugh...,"This book seems like a rough draft for her other, better, novels. I'm a man's man-I like Hemingway, professional boxing, and dog fights--but I've always enjoyed Jane Austen. Not with this one. I feel like slapping all of the characters and telling them to shut up. ""Stop talking about yourselves!"""
2,wait for the movie,"It's rare when the film version triumphs over the novel original; however, that's the case with Jane Austen's ""Mansfield Park."" Unlike the clever Elizabeth Bennett of ""Pride and Prejudice"" or the lovely and lively Emma, Fanny Price is moralizing and priggish to a fault. Even Austen's own mother declared Fanny ""insipid""! I love the other novels, even the underrated ""Lady Susan,"" but I could not finish this one.Instead of reading the novel, enjoy the 1999 film version:Mansfield Park (1999). Frances O'Connor creates a spunky, witty version of Fanny Price that deviates from the novel and is all the better for it."
3,Not My favorite but Still Glad I read it!,"This is my least favorite of Jane Austen's novels. I am glad that I read it of course and I would be tempted to pick it up someday again and see if I think differently of it. It's strange because you never fully connect or actually like the heroine. It's the only book I've ever read where I was hoping the main male character ended up with the heroine's competition! Likeable book, unlikeable heroine would be my way of summing it up."
4,A Fan of Fanny,"I have read this book many times. It isn't as fun to read as some of Austin's other works, but I enjoy it anyway. It is a bit like a Cinderella tale."
2,If you like bad books... This is a must have!,"Definitely one of Jane Austen's worst books. At the beginning you think ...What?!! At the middle you think... Pretty good! But by the end you think... Give me a toilet so I can flush it down!!!!!!!!! You wait the ENTIRE book for something that happens in the last 2 pages. I quit 3 pages before the ending positive that Fanny would never get married. But then my sister said, ""You just have to be patient."" Then I told her that I had been patient for the last 384 pages and I certainly was not going to ""be patient"" any longer! Well I was patient and finished it, but I must confess I no longer know where the book is. Because when you turn around and throw a book into a cramped toy room. It is incredibly hard to find."
2,Fanny is bland and insipid.,"With all of Ms. Austen's delightful, engaging heroines, couldn't she have done better with this one?WHAT a tiresome prig she is!"
2,I can't finish this story.,"This is the second time I have read this book, and I just can't finish it. I purchased ""Murder at Mansfield Park"" and had to remember the characters. Unfortunately, it's just too boring. I'd like to take Fanny and knock some sense into her. Tell her to be more human, more tolerant, more likeable. However, that's how things were back in Jane Austen's time. Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, Emma, were not as hard to get through. I will not waste my time on Murder at Mansfield Park."
3,mansfields my name dont ware it out,the name of the book is what caught my eye because my last name is Mansfield and was happy to find out it was a pretty good book :)
3,"I, as a devoted Austen fan, was disapointed in this book","I have read all of Austens books, excluding Persuasion, and I think that this was the worst of her novels. The main character was boring and a pushover if not unlikeable. However, that is not my reason for not liking it. I found it boring and last 3 chapters or so scandal breaks. Not only are the chapters leading up to these scandals dull but when they occur they happen to people who have been so far removed from the plot that one cannot sympathize with them. The movie was actually better than the book. A rare occurance and one I did not expect from the acclaimed Miss. Austen."
1,This is a tough one,"I guess, if one were to compare Mansfield Park with a book by almost any other author, it would stand out. Unfortunately, however, I compare Mansfield Park with the rest of Jane Austen's oeuvre, namely P&P, Emma, Persuasion, Sense & Sensibility, etc. Against that kind of competition, Mansfield Park is weak. Fanny Price is an insipid wimp who watches life pass her by. I have always found it hard to believe that the woman who gave us Lizzy Bennet, Emma Woodhouse and Elinor Dashwood could have given us Fanny Price. The former do not suffer fools lightly, and Fanny is a fool who enjoys suffering.I do recommend that people read this, but only AFTER reading Austen's other books because Jane Austen at her weakest is superior to most authors at their best."
1,Oh geez...,"This is one of the dullest works by Austen. However could someone get into the book and actually finish it without having fallen asleep. A dreadful book to read, indeed."
1,Buy a Different Edition,"I love Jane Austen's stories so my problem is not with them at all - the physical book, however, was awful. The pages are that of books from a book club. The paper was coarse and had uneven edges.The information in the book was great, including other movies and books inspired by each novel. I really like that part of it but could not get over the lack of quality in the paper and presentation.Unless you do not mind the eyesores and absent neatness, buy a different version of this book."
1,Avoid this ripoff!,"This is a horrible excuse for a printed book. It was evidently downloaded from a site featuring public domain books, and printed with an on-demand printing service, with absolutely no formatting or other work done to the book- as evidenced by the fact that the header at the top of each page ACTUALLY SAYS ""Mansfield Park.txt"". The font is an unreadable san-serif font. This is an unbelievable rip-off, pure and simple. AVOID!"
5,Jane Austen's Mansfield Park,"I admit it, I'm a rabid Austen fan. I like Pride and Prejudice best, closely followed by Mansfield Park, Sense and Sensibility and Emma. The characters are well-drawn and internally consistent; the story line flows with a sense of inevitability that is both charming and compelling. My preference for P&P has to do with the like-ability of the central characters to a late-20th century (or, now, early 21st century) reader. I find Fanny just a bit too much like a frightened rabbit and Edmund just a bit too much like toast soaked in warm milk. But I love the book and return to reread it every couple years. And how better to do that than on my Kindle?"
3,Not a bad book - just not phenomenal as I had expected,"I wanted to love this book - of course I wanted to - I wanted it to have the magic of Austen's other work. Sadly, I was disappointed. It is absolutely not a bad book - just not a phenomenal one as I had expected. The plot and the characters come across as far too didactic and judgmental and perhaps even (gulp) a tad anti-feminist. I'm trying to rethink the book so that I can reach any other conclusion - I'm trying to remember it was a product of its times - yet, I haven't been able to come around yet.Would I recommend this book for you? Are you hoping for another Pride & Prejudice or Sense & Sensibility? Well, then no. Are you looking to enjoy Austen's lavish prose, intricately developed characters, and an accurate depiction of what women realistically could strive for in the early 19th century? Then absolutely, you'll love this book."
3,"sick, yet gripping","It has been over 35 years since I read this, but I do recall that once started, I couldn't put it down and even cut classes that a.m. to finish it. I recall also that my eyes were popping as I read of the increasingly weird adventures of this girl who back then seemed utterly stupid and unbelievable. Today, I'm not so sure what message I would receive from Candy - - will have to try a re-read. I also remember feeling physically ill after finishing it and skipped lunch too that day."
2,What happened to the rest,Unfortunately I did not know there were multiple versions of this book. The one I got was edited - I wish there had been a warning
4,Yes,"Read this in college and again recently. Still wicked, and who can forget that last page. A satire that is as revevant now as it was when first published"
3,Good grief! What a strange story!,"What in the world was this book about? I'm all confused. Indeed it held my interest, but what a bizarre way of doing it. I don't remember recognizing a plot, only lots of sex. I can't say it was either a good or bad read, because honestly I have no idea. It was definitely different and unlike anything I have ever read. But, if you're interested in a quick journey down Weird Street, this novel will absolutely take you there."
2,candy,"Perhaps it was because I have yet to read Voltaire's Candide, but Southern's Candy was completely lost on me. There was enough perversity and bizarreness to keep me reading until the end but I was left feeling that it was a bit incomplete and a bit pointless. Nevertheless, I get the feeling that Southern is a talented writer, and perhaps this just wasn't one of his better works."
1,Don't waste your time.,"This is not a satire of Candide, it's not a slice of pop culture. It's a dirty old man's idea of what sex should be like. A dirty old virgin man.It's boring. The writing is atrocious. It has several rapes and incest scenes in it. It has no more than one instance of a woman enjoying sex (and I can't be sure about that one) with sex on nearly every page. It is racist and sexist and boring. If you want 80 variations on what to call a woman's sexual organs, this is the book for you (honey pot, lamb-pit, sugar scoop, ever-sweeting, etc). If you want a book indicitive of the culture of the time, or just plain full of sex, please look elsewhere."
4,Obsession I can understand,This movie promises much but delivers a product that does not do the actors justice. It suffers from a disjointed script and is way too ambitious in trying to cover the scope of true obsession. I did not get to grips with the charactors as deeply as I would have had hoped and despite a stirling job from Daniel Craig and Heike Matkatch they seem to wander around in a dream at times.Obsession in itself is a highly charged emotion and there are some good scenes throughout this movie but ultimately this film suffered in the editing room and it's a real shame. I enjoyed it but not at the deeper level I was looking for. Also I didn't get the ending. You are left wondering what happened. did they all live together?Great performances from all the actors involved but as for the director - could do better
3,"Watch it if you love one of the actors, otherwise...","Watch it if you love one of the actors, otherwise this story makes little sense. The actors do a great job, but the disjointed editing leaves the viewer wondering what is going on most of the time and, ultimately, there is little or no resolution to the movie."
3,Quirky but would watch again,It is surely not an american film but it was different and a love triangle so I watched. I would watch again.
3,Overview is lacking in some regards,"The author's choices are a little strange to me. Why spend so much time on the pre-Buddhist vedic tradition and then say absolutely nothing about Buddhism in India post-Ashoka? Granted, he mentions that there isn't much information to be had about Theravada in India, but there is some. He cuts right to Sri Lanka though.Otherwise its a decent overview. If it was titled ""A Social History from 430-300 BCE and 1100-present CE"" it would be much more accurate."
4,Holiness,This book is very detailed and covers the subject very well. It is not written in the easy to read style of modern books and demands concentration. Ryle backs up his thoughts with plenty of references to scripture. His thoughts would be in line with the Puritans. The book is both challenging and encouraging.
4,something to chew on..,very fascinating perspective with so many parallels to present day. Am only half way through but have been enjoying the depth of the writing. Have run into a couple areas of doctrine that I'm still chewing on to determine how I actually feel about the scriptural foundations of the author's convictions. A book worth reading.
5,Enormous weight to the writing,"One of the best books I've ever read. The book was written over a century ago, but remains highly readable and relevant.What has grabbed me above all is the weight and depth to Ryle's writing - what used to be called 'unction' in former days. I doubt that any studious reader could fail to find great benefit from it."
4,Review of Tornadoes of the United States,"I first read this book when I was very young. At the time, I didn't see a great many books dealing with this subject that had such great pictures. It was one of the things that drew me to this book. After checking it out my 100th time, I finally read it. It is a well put together book although nowadays, it would be considered outdated by some of the science in what makes a tornado go (I believe the book leaves off in 1953 or 1954 when it was published). Barring that, it is a well researched book and it gives some good insight as to what it was like to experience tornadoes before the days of Doppler Weather Radar and even regular radar. All you had was some good country sense and hope that somebody spotted the storm before it reached you...a lead warning time of just minutes usually. I would recommend this book for the die hard tornado enthusiast since it shows just how far we have come to understanding and predicting these marvels of nature."
4,Awesome Gift,"My 7 year old son is a huge Bears fan and loves this truck. It was not expensive and it is very durable, which is key since my boys play with it all the time and are typical boys in their style of plan, rough."
3,Not what I expected,"These songs are techno re-mixes of the originals, which can be found on the earlier CD - ""Piccolo Amore"".I don't like techno. It's just drum rythm and not enough melody.Sadly, I didn't know what I'm buying.I will buy the original ""Piccolo Amore"", it reminds me of my youth."
1,I'm a Maria fan,"I only bought this for the track ""Mamma Maria"" which I first heard when I was in Europe in 2006. It has obviously been a perennial hit. Can't comment on the another tracks."
4,"Transformers, Bumblebee","These transformer toys are awesome and enjoyed by allboys. The Transformer movie has inspired the sale of thesetoys. They are easy to transform and the kids will sit and play for hours with them, mimicking scenes from the movie."
5,bumblebee transformer 1974 camaro,"Transformers Movie Deluxe Bumblebee 1974 CamaroMy Grandson asked for this transformer for christmas, He enjoyed it and played with it christmas Day and had alot of fun. I would reccommend it for other children."
2,"A waste of money, unless you can't get your hands on the '08 model","When you stand this Bumblebee up next to the other movie Transformers, your first reaction will be extreme disappointment. Although it's not the crappiest Transformer I've ever seen, it doesn't hold a candle to the 2008 Bumblebee. It's much less aesthetically pleasing, poseable, and accurate than it's more stylish counterpart, and the color is just wrong.Did I mention that it's easy to break?Don't buy this unless you desperately want a Bee and can't find the '08."
2,Not worth the money,"This Bumblebee breaks easily, and it's the same size as the bumblebees that sell for $9.99 everywhere. It's almost identical to them, unless you count the guns that are easily lost. We were really disapointed, I can't believe they're charging this much for this piece of junk."
1,Yeesh,"Well, I wish I had listened to everyone that said it was flimsy and breakable. Ours isn't broken yet, but I'm sure it will be soon. This will be our yardstick for years to come when we think about overspending on a toy just because our son ""has to have it."" No, he doesn't. And I wish we'd saved our money this time around."
1,Misleading,"I was very dissapointed with the toy, it is very small and not worth the price you charge. It was 8inches long and it transforms in to a very small doll. It was extremely overpriced."
2,What a ripoff!,I would have rated all 1's but my son does play with this even though it does not transform. I have read similar reviews; the front end as a Camaro will not click into place. If this toy were cheaper I could have lived with it but this is such a ripoff! As far as educational value it teaches kids that they won't get what they pay for and to not trust toy manufacturers!
3,Deluxe Bumblebee - Disappointed,"I bought this as a birthday gift for my nephew at his request. I looked in the stores and found they were nowhere to be found. I had no choice but to order online. For $50 + I ordered this item and thought - it's probably too expensive but he really wants it. When i finally saw my nephew and he showed me his birthday gift, I couldn't believe my eyes when i saw this 4''plastic toy that cost me over $50. As long as he was thrilled with it what could I say. but.....I will never do that again."
3,"Well, its sorta Bumblebee","Having purchased this early, I must say I want to like this figure. Considering that because of VW's stubbornness this could not be a Bug but instead a Camaro, it's not bad, although I would have appreciated some typical Bumblebee horns.In robot mode, it has some stability problems, but I've seen worse. In car mode, it nice. [...] But even afterwards, I still haven't been able to totally transform it back to car as the front of the Camaro won't stay put; it keeps flopping down. Just the initial transformation was worrisome; I kept thinking I am about to break the toy, and now when I want to turn it back to car, it won't go back in position.If you like Bumblebee, you'll probably want him, but he's more for a collector to have on his shelf than for a kid to actually play with."
1,trust those who say bumblebee is broken..,"Like the many who reported having bumblebee's front part of the camaro refusing to stay put, I have the exact same problem. The latch to keep the stupid spring loaded front hood is of the wrong side which basically makes this version of bumblebee unable to transform to a car. You're basically stuck with the robot.Barricade is extremely hard to transform back to a car but I was eventually able to do it. I can't believe it took me that long too. I bought my kid maybe 5 other transformer toys and this is the first time I have been disappointed. Stay away from the Bumblebee/barricade combo toy. You'll only regret it later...I definitely am."
2,This is a good toy but there are some bad version of this toy out,i got a another bumblebee that was one of the good version and i love it i would pick this up 4 and transformer fans and classic car fans.
1,"Smaller than looks on Ad, falls apart","This toy arrived, well packed much earlier than I thought and I thank seller for this. However to my surprise, it was much smaller than I thought. It gives impression that it is bigger in photos here. Wasn't impressed with quality. On first conversion attempt, parts started falling apart and by end of May most of them have chipped away one by one even though I tried converting it carefully myself. Wouldn't recommend this product."
2,Doesn't lock together quite right,"Warning: once you transform this toy into robot mode, you will NEVER be able to put it back into perfect vehicle mode. The front end keeps popping off instead of staying in place. There's this pedal-like structure underneath that's apparently supposed to do something, but I don't know what it's supposed to do. The front end pops off whether the thingie is pushed in or extended."
1,"Broken, WARNING to all!",Do not buy this toy. The front hood will break when you put it into robot mode or back into car mode. This is why the Bumblebee toy is so hard to find.STAY AWAY and keep your money!
3,Bumblebee,"Well I was excited about finally finding bumblebee, but foudn two. oneis to open, and one is sealed.well I opened it and wondered what exactly is automorph? all it was was the front popped down. big deal. whats so automorph about that?then I broke the arm off, and his head fell offI'm [...], so whats to expect from a [...]trying to play with it.It took a few minutes to get him actually together since the instructions only tell you how to morph him from car to ""man""its now just sitting on my desk.Toys now are way too expensive for what you get. like their marvel legends and others.whatever happened to the quality of transformers. when I was 5 playing with G1 toys, I had no problem at all!"
1,disappointed,I bought this toy as a Christmas gift and was very disappointed. It is about 4 or 5 inches tall and very useless for a 5 yr old who was wanting something a bit larger. I thought I was getting something of decent size (aka 10 - 12 inches at least). I had to go buy something else to go with this gift so he wouldn't have been disappointed.
1,Disappointed!!,My son loves the bumblebee transfomers!! We purchased this bumblebee for his birthday. When we received it and took it out of the box the right door fell off. It was cracked and not fixable. My son was so sad because we tried replacing it for a new one but we were not allowed to. They would only allow us to get a refund that would take 4 weeks. Horrible!!!
5,A must have for all kids!,"My son was 8 years old when we purchased this a year ago. He is now 9yo and still plays with this toy. Makes a very fun and unique way to work on mechanical abilities and problem solving skills. Some of the movements needed are a little too hard for even me to perform, but in general a child can do it on their own, and they learn to read the directions to do it! Kids love these, they are still a big hit!Thanks"
3,Hood hinge broke easily: advice on how to avoid,"I bought this for my 9yo, but ended up opening it before he had a chance. When I went to convert it from car to robot, the latch stuck. Not knowing this was the case, I continued the transform and part of the cam/hinge easily broke off. The hood/shoulders still move, but there's a little coiled spring inside that's exposed now and likely to fall out soon.Lesson learned: FULLY depress the air-intake button on the hood before moving hood. On mine the button would have needed to be depressed below the surrounding hood in order to clear the stop on the cam/hinge."
3,BumbleBee,"First of all, congratulations to the group of people who think and model this toy. It has a very good design. However, the quality is poor, and the connections are slightly loose. The arm (which becomes the door) keeps falling off. My son takes good care of his toys (he hardly breaks anything, but I don't think this will last for more than a month or two. Slightly expensive for the life it carries."
3,No more than meets the eye,It's smaller than it looked in the picture so all the pieces are smaller too. But my son still loves it!
2,Bumblebee broke down...again!!,"I have now had this problem with the hood of my sons Bumblebee. My 7 year old bought Bumblebee with his own money, and found out after a day, that the hood would not latch, which is the same problem everyone else has. I have examied the toy, and found the little yellow piece that is attached to the hood, and the button, is very weak, and part of it just snaps off. So, we just got home from taking it back to get another one, and we have not even been home for 1 hour, and the same thing happened again. The toy is a good toy, but now my son is also stuck with a robot, and not a car. I will not keep wasting gas to exchange this toy, but I will try it one more time. I think it would be fine, but you just have to be extremely careful with it so it does not break. I'm willing to bet, that out of every ten people that buy one, at least 8 will break. Just my opinion."
2,Slightly Disappointed...,"As one of the first TF toys I saw in the store, I snatched up the ""classic Camaro"" version of Bumblebee. Unfortunately, it has a pretty poor paint job. His face is missing some of the silver markings that should have been painted, and the ""missile launchers"" are solid yellow instead of the translucent purple that are shown on the package. Also, the windows are painted instead of being made of translucent plastic like on the Alternators. The legs of the robot are awkward and hard to pose, and I had a hard time on the very first transformation sequence, where you push a button to fold down the front of the car. I was afraid I would break it, but you have to push the button very hard to get it to work. I hope I don't have one of the defective ones.It seems like every time there are new TF toys out they get more and more fragile. Not much of a play-toy, more of a collector's item."
2,what happened?,"i remember transformers as a child being a LOT more durable then this hunk of crap. parts fall off, legs come out of joint. if you must have one buy a different model i know there are better made t-formers out there"
3,"It's ok, but not a great movie","There are a handful of fun scenes, but overall it is a fairly predictable movie. More than a few things about it are highly unrealistic though and it portrays Americans in a very poor light. I didn't spend much for the movie but even so I feel like I spent too much on it."
4,Light and Hardy.,I got this bag 3 months ago and love it. It's much lighter than most luggage bag in it's size category and yet it's body is quite strong and hardy. And the best part is it's low price tag.
5,Flowery language married to an unforgettable story,"Although history-challenged readers may want to beg off, the story of the most notorious woman in the ancient world and her lover Pericles is one of the most romantic sagas. This union died all too soon with Pericles' death from the plague, but the words, emotions, and example live on.The effusive verbose rich 19th-century language (""I wish the gods would sweep [Aspasia] up to Olympus where she belongs"") and the ancient references (fyi: Hekatombaion is a month), as well as a culture where sixteen-year-old girls get married off, are a bit daunting, as are many endless debates about religion vs. science, and more political maneuverings than the last ten presidential campaigns combined. But this story reminds us that we are not so very different from our ancient ancestors, and we still enjoy a great drama!"
5,Great Mommy Bag!,"This bag is excellent for carrying items for kids, school, and groceries. It's easy to carry, and tough enough to withstand even the most daunting of items! I love it! I use it to carry the things I use to teach Preschool! I have to watch or my kids will try to borrow it! It cleans up really good too! I'm getting ready to buy one for my mom!"
4,good book that contains useful information,I read this book when it first came out and I have been doing the face excercises almost everyday since then. I am very pleased with the noticeable results. The book contains easy to read exercises for your face. It also contains techniques that will actually reverse your facial lines.the book talks about facial massage and the proper make-up to use on all kinds of skin. I'm very pleased and I have bought several copies of this book to pass on to friends.
3,Rachel Back In the Day,"I bought this book and Rachel's products beginning in the 1970s. The book is appropriate if you have access to the skin products. I recently searched for Rachel Perry products(which I usually bought at my favorite 1970s health food store) and discovered that her company no longer produces the creams, masks, eye colors, blushes that I bought back then. Wonderful products. Visually pleasing packages. The smells were fantastic. I loved her blue clay mask.I really think that this book is a moot point without the product. Such a shame that the product is no longer made, with the exception of the lemon citrus cleanser(yum) and a couple of other products that I have never used. Rachel, we miss you."
3,Some Good Advice But Not Quite Enough,"I thought this book contained alot of facial exercises and bought it on the advice of a friend. I was dissapointed in the amount of facial exercises offered. The exercises are too few and most of the book is about skin care. The author recommends her own skincare product line (beware of authors who try to push their own products). The book is pretty good for someone who needs basic information on skin care. For those interested in serious facial exercise I would recommend Carole Maggio's book and video ""Facercise"", and also a video called Flex-Effect by Deborah Crowley. These really work."
2,Reverse the Aging Process on Your Face : A Simple Technique,I was quite disappointed in this book. Author shows pictures on how to do the exercises but try as I might I couldn't get my face take on the same look as she did or to use the same muscles. Also to do her technique you would need at least 45min a day .. Who has that much time to spend??? The photo at the back also takes away from the book. In the book she tells us that you can look beautiful at any age without a face lift and on the back cover author looks like she's had several of them... Her skin stretched to max. Very disappointing ...
3,Black and white becomes this thriller,"It is a good movie but I am tempted to think half the reason it works is it in black and white. In color with the same direction, script, and actors this film would have been much less scarey. The pod folks once they (with talk) reveal themselves are vaguely explained, not very frightening and not very threatening either (the '78 version of IOTBS explained them way better). A few kudos to lovely Dana Winter for her fine portrayal of Becky Driscoll."
4,Above average for its vintage,"This is better than many 1950s sci-fi films, though it still has its share of horribly clunky dialogue and absurdly chaste relations between the men and women. There's not much for special effects here, just the giant pods. If you want to be transported back to a more innocent era, this oldie still holds up."
3,Can't get the sound to work,I purchased one copy and the sound didn't work. So I sent it back for a new one and the same problem. I have a Visio 5.1 sound bar. I also tried hooking it up using my tv speakers. I really would hate to return this knowing that others didn't have this problem. I rated it a 3 star giving it an average rating like most people. Any ideas or help would be greatly appreciated.
5,Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"My personal 50s sci-fi favorite, ""Invasion"" is an ingenious nightmare vision that reflects the paranoia of the time created by McCarthyism. Absent of the effects that characterize more recent entries in this genre, the film remains genuinely creepy strictly on the basis of story, direction and performances."
3,Not as scary.,"After seeing that another remake of this story was being filmed I had to get my own copy of the original. I had seen this film when it first came out many, many years ago. At that time I was terrified. This time around I found it not as scary as I remembered. The story line is the same as the remake with Donald Sutherland. It is fun viewing these older films and seeing the way film making has changed over the years."
1,Amazon.com sells COLORIZED version of 1956 film,"Film is great, but avoid the colorized version. It's unfortunate enough that the studios altered the film in the 1950s by adding unnecessary footage to the beginning and end. But at least the original film remains as the director intended in between the extra footage. The film is terribly damaged, however, by colorizing it."
4,We are not who we are,"Body Snatchers is good old fashioned B-Movie hokum that gives more bang for its buck than expected. It was an instant classic hit more than just a popcorn fodder monster flick. What make Body Snatchers work is that it is powerfully psychological. There are no makeup effects or monsters but just people like you or me who are not what they seem. This is an amazingly effectively ploy that creates edge of your seat paranoia and hyper tension throughout. It is high concept paying off in aces.Dr Miles Bennell finds people in his town coming to his practice complaining that friends and relatives are not what they are. Eventually his scepticism turns to fear and he uncovers a horrible truth that the town is being taken over by aliens that can mimic humans. It is also directed by the man who brought us Dirty Harry, Don Siegal."
4,Film transfer much improved over DVD version but no extras a minor flaw,"Perhaps the finest science fiction film released during the golden era of the genre is finally given a decent and much improved transfer over the DVD release some 10 years ago. There is no mistake that the original version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers remains the most potent depiction of 1950's paranoia with one of the most chilling presentations the loss of identity theme ever committed to celluloid. This film also marked the beginning of Science Fiction Film Noir and remains the finest of the four filmed versions of Jack Finney's celebrated novel. For such a landmark in the science fiction film genre, it is a pity that there are no extras. The film deserves a 5 star rating and this Blu Ray transfer is probably as good as it will ever get - a vast improvement over the previous DVD release but it deserves extras worthy of this masterwork."
5,A True Horror,"The real horror is not of the invasion itself nor the changes in people, but wether or not one can escape it. What if the plot of the movie realy happens? I asked myself these questions when I saw the movie. It starts in one town, but they plan to ship the pods all over the country and the world! This is a movie with no ending to it."
3,An 80 minute movie with a 4 hour plot,"The film moves too fast and would have been better as a mini series. Too much is happening but the premise is easy to follow and the acting is acceptable. Whenever I watch this film I am always left with a creepy feeling of dispair. Overall, if you enjoy 50's science fiction, you will probably be satisfied with the video."
3,Good,"Will look at it again to give better review,as when it was viewed I may have been distracted and not able to get into the real plot"
3,Bashful's DVD Summary #020,"Best:1) It's a great example of a B-movie that became a genre classic. That alone makes it worth a look.2) It shows how black & white filming can add elements of creepiness that's hard to duplicate in color.3) It still makes you think about the possibility of ""pod people"" alien takeovers in real life (especially when one of your friends starts acting strangely).Worst:1) Although it's great 1950's fare, it's still low-budget and the acting was generally period melodrama. Older folks will appreciate it more than young people.2) Aside from a short interview with Kevin McCarthy (for a talk show sometime in the 1990's) there are no special features at all. That's a real shame for this one, being that it deserves more discussion.Recommendation:Lovers of great oldies rate this one highly for it's nostalgia value. Others, however, may find it a bit corny by today's standards. Regardless, it's a must-have for any serious sci-fi/horror movie collector."
4,DVD movies,"Another classic SciFi flick. I remember this from my childhood, watching TV late on school nights when I was supposed to be asleep. Alot of fun!"
3,Bare Bones Issue,I just got this an hour ago. The picture and sound are superb. For the amount of money spent I sort of expected some extras on the disk and at least english sub-titles. There were none of either and that's why I only give this 3 stars.
2,Not the good version,"This DVD contains the revised ending of the film, not the original, truly distrubing ending. I would wait and purchase the film with the original ending."
5,Absolutely great,Want a fantastaic sci fi movie? This 1956 goodness is perfect for anyone who likes the amazing cheesy stuff; stay away from the newer one---the black and white is worth it!
2,Should be in the 'bargain bin',"What a letdown.The blue-ray disc of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" has absolutely no extras included. No trailer. No commentary track. No subtitles for the hearing-impaired. The movie itself is terrific. The blue-ray transfer is done very well. I especially like that the original ""Superscope"" aspect ratio of 2:1 was used, not quite Cinemascope, but more widescreen than the standard 1.85:1. But for the price, this release should have all the standard extras that are included on practically every other blue-ray disc and dvd. This bare-bones disc belongs in the bargain bin. The movie itself rates 5 stars, but due to the lack of added features this disc rates only 2 stars."
3,"Blu-Ray: Okay, but I could have done as well with DVD","Sometimes, especially with some older movies it's hard to tell the difference between a DVD playing in an upscaling DVD player vs. Blu-Ray Disc in Blu-Ray player. To me, this is one of those times, where I could have saved a few bucks and been just as happy with what I saw on the screen. There are exceptions when the Blu-Ray is actually less expensive than the DVD, but not very often."
2,"Yes, it's a classic but...","It's severely spoiled by the imposed framing story - where the authorities defeat the Pod People after all - and (for me) by the obvious right-wing bias of the filmmakers. Let's be honest, this movie is all about the creeping Soviet menace and how Communists are slowly taking over the Land of the Free and Home of the Brave. Check out director Don Siegel's Dirty Harry if you don't believe me."
1,Pathetic!,Everybody in my class hated it.I watched it.Not scary.Not scary at all.The remake wasn't scary either.But it was better.
1,More bootleg garbage from Telavista,"Don't be fooled by the better-than-average artwork (compared to their usual sh--ty-looking color Xerox sleeves), because this is the usual Telavista con job: a bootleg DVD-R 'mastered' from a 20+ years-old VHS cassette (maybe, if you're lucky). BE WARNED and do NOT support these pirates!"
3,clear sound quality but mozart should be happier than brendel,i like gulda stylei think brendel is better at schubertnot mozartthe style is cerebral not musical
2,Disappointing!,"This DVD showcases some mouth-watering male specimens, and they might have had a chance to heat up the screen if less time were spent on the photographer yakking. In fact, just about the time the photo shoots get intesting, the filmmakers cut to images of unrelated, inanimate objects or to the (relatively unattractive) photographer again. And the music is simply AWFUL, like bad '80s porno music mixed with mediocre dance music. I expected this DVD to be similar to the ""Dieux du Stade"" releases, but this seems aimed at teen girls. There's just not much that sexy, or even that interesting, here."
3,Man cake,"This is a good insight to how the calendars are in a interesting way.There is no full frontly nudity,but more then enough to keep the Ladies and gay man smiling.Truly mens bodies at their finest and all for a great charty."
2,flat football,"waste of time. didn,t even watch it to the end. some of the sound was bad. the intention was good but the film fell short."
2,OK,Not worth the price - should be free. Why are the charging to rent something when it should be free.
3,its ok,"its seems to jump from part to part to much, not what I like in a movie but its for a great cause and it was ok"
5,The best flavor!,If you need pedialyte grape is the best flavor you can buy. I swear by this stuff and its never let me down.
1,Also Contains ZINC,"The description does not tell you that this product also contains ZINC. If your like me and cannot have anything ""extra"" in your pedialyte, this caused me to buy an entire case that I cannot use. If your going to add ZINC, then at least put it in the description."
4,Rasfox Carry Case for Portable DVD Player,"This carrying case is a good sturdy case and has all the features you want for your portable DVD player. It keeps it safely tucked away or fastens to the seats of your vehicle for viewing. All the straps needed are included. The extra storage pocket is great for holding cords, headphones, DVD's, etc. Be sure to measure your portable DVD player before buying. Mine fit the measurements listed on the ad page but it is a very tight fit, and keep in mind how the DVD player will sit inside the case, if yours has buttons around the sides of it then you may want more room around the player to get to those, add these extras into the size of the player when measuring. All in all it is a great deal and well worth the price."
2,Not worth it.,You might as well not waste your money on this cheapo case. Spend more money and get something better.
5,Great Show!,"Never saw this show before I got it here on Amazon. Turned out to be very funny, and a worth while show to watch. The quality is perfect for computer use (good clear image, while downloading fast. No buffering needed if using a Cable connection or higher, haven't tested with DSL or lower) No commercials make it easy to watch and you hardly notice where commercials would have gone. Little about the show: Zoey (Jamie-Lynn Spears), is a very down to earth ""average"" girl who starts school at PCA [Pacific Coast Academy] which is a private school that used to be a all boys school. She moves in with her two roomates, meets her best friend, and several other friends. Each episode is based relatively on day to day life living at school. Highly recommended show. According to wikipedia, the show was takin off the air partly because of background reasons with the main character, but the show is still good, and I see no reason to believe otherwise."
5,PCA kicked off with a bang and Nickelodeon's best ever show is now on DVD,"This is something I've been wanting to purchase since watching on Nick in 2005.The show contains all 13 wonderful episodes, my only concern is there in letterbox and the show was made in 4:3 meaning I have to change my TV settings to watch it but I have watched each episode 3 times anyway and even my grandmother at 80 has been brought recently into liking this show so I'll hopefully get season 2 soon but I am waiting on a few other season 1's before I move on to more action at PCA in Zoey 101, Nickelodeon's greatest ever drama series."
4,Brought back summer memories...,"The moment I saw this was on Amazon instant I was hesitant to buy it because of the price. However after thinking about it for a day or two, I finally buckled down and bought it. I'm rating it four stars because at the moment, only certain episodes are available on Xbox 360, which is my primary method of entertainment next my Roku. The quality is excellent, and so far I haven't run into any problems."
2,works but 1 use?,"The comb works great but where the blade is inserted, the clip holding it in falls out and allows the blade to fall out of the comb...DANGEROUS! It did this the first time I used it and unless I get out the duct tape, I will not be using it again! DO NOT BUY!!!"
4,zigirl67,Cheap and really sharp. It does what I was hoping it would do to my hair and I'm glad I bought it. Although it does cause some split ends.
5,One of JD's best albums!!,"This is a GREAT album for the JD fan, especially like ""A little further north"" you can see his need to get away for quiet and peace, and you feel that you can see him where he sings about...and ""I see you sleeping"" makes me think of when Jesse Belle was born, the words fit perfectly.""Horses and Eagles"" has always been one of my favorites and this version is AWESOME, the music background he did in this one, REALLY brings forth his talent. A MUST album for anyone who loves JD's music!!!!"
5,Excellent! Great source of information,"I read this book non-stop. Great source of information. I am currently reading the second volume, which is just as good."
5,Brilliant,"I know it's all been said before, but previous reviewers are right on the money. This book, without doubt is the best resource for No-Limit Hold-Em tournaments. You will not find one better. Volume 2 is just as good as well.Thanks Dan"
5,wow just got this book.,"just got this book i have 14 poker books now but this is the best of all of em.no messing about like in most poker books with basic play, rules, how to play etcthis gets straight into the heart of a tournament by assuming that you already know how to play poker.at 374 pages long this is a good readonly on page 55 and already learnt a lot of thingscant wait to get book 2"
4,Harington on Hold'em Vol I & II,"If you play no limit tournament Hold'em these two books are the definitive guides to successful play. Vol I deals with the early stages of a tournament when stack sizes are roughly the same, they are much larger than the blinds, and the money is far off in the distance.Vol II shows you what happens when those conditions break down. The blinds go up and the stack sizes become wildly different.He uses tons of examples to explain his ideas and concepts. Very well written."
5,Harrington Volume I,"I've read about ten Holdem books and another 20 poker books over the years. This is probably the best book I've read on Holdem (I've read Brunson(2), Helmuth, Gordon(3),Warren, Caro, Ciaffone/Brier -- all good). Harrington really knows his stuff (obviously). What surprized me most was the quality of the writing. I've written several books and knows what it takes to get a readable, enjoyable non-fiction book; it is really tough. Harrington organization, exposition and examples (problems) are all first rate. I'm going to buy the other two volumes. Any serious student of Holdem needs to read Harrington."
4,Excellent overview of tournament play,"This is a great book on NLHE tournament strategy. It has an easy-to-read style, and focuses on advanced topics. This is probably not a beginner's book, but will be very helpful to intermediate and advanced players. I consider this to be the best poker book I have ever read, and I've read most of them. Even if your style differs from Harrington's (and he does tend to be of a more conservative mentality than most), this book will absolutely add to your game."
3,Harrington on Hold'em,I thought I knew how to play poker until I read Harrington on Hold'emIt's like getting private lessons from a pro who's been there.jb
5,Kudos to Dan and Bill,"Finally, a book that actually improved my game. Great job boys. Can't wait for the next 20 volumes !!!Of all the poker books, I've bought over the years, this is one of the few that I can remcomend."
3,Good beginner book,"I purchased this book due to all the good reviews. This book is written well with some info that is good for people do not know concepts like pot valves and counting how many outs your hand has. I feel that most people who play at a higher level may find this book not to be much help if they play at an advanced level. I like Slansky's books a little more and are a little more involved. Not a bad book , but not what I was looking for."
5,Finally a book different from the rest,"Harringtons book is about the sixth book i have read on No Limit hold em. I found that after a certain amount of understanding of the game, information becomes somewhat repetative to the advanced player. I had read about pot and implied odds quite a bit before but i always seemed to find myself making quick calls without really speculating the hand. Harringtons book talks about these concepts with great detail while making them simple to understand. If you implement these strategies into live poker as well as online, results will be seen quickly and often. Definetely the best read on No Limit hold em i have come across. I recommend this book for the player that has a decent grasp of most concepts already, but i don't think it should be the first book you read on hold em. Definetely a must read for anyone trying to succeed at poker."
5,Worth every penny,"Must buy. Worth every penny. This with volume two are great and if the material is mastered, your returns will be greater than you expected. Aides through all the lower to middle levels."
5,Winning Poker Book,Great book for INT/ADV players. The problems and exercises presented really support the material in the chapters. Good post flop analysis.
4,Great book,"If I would make a list of top needed books for a Hold'em pro, this one surely goes into the first three. Add Slansky's 'Hold'em Poker For Advanced Players' and Barboianu's 'Texas Hold'em Odds' for full coverage on odds and math and you will have all you need to know for winning. The rest is practice and patience."
5,Solid Book,"There have been many in-depth reviews of this book so I will make this short. If you spend time going through this book it WILL improve your game. The strategy is well laid out and the explanations in the examples gives insight into a top poker players thought process. Many examples state that some of the other answers are also plausible for certain reasons, but he states clearly why HE thinks one play is better than another. A must read for any No Limit Poker Player. str"
5,Awfully Perfect,"It is really something !!! First few pages are average, but then the tension is increasing and increasing and increasing and you want more and more and the you will go ahead and buy next two volumes :o)but seriously, well written and very, very good from advice / strategic perspective +++For me Poker Bible :o)Thank"
5,entertaining and informative,"As other reviews have pointed out, it distills Sklansky's and Brunson's thoughts into digestible form. I thought it stood out from both of those books, though, for 2 reasons: its flexibility and its personal style.Harrington is of course known for a particular style of play, and he explains its merits in the text. He also explains its disadvantages, though, and presents alternative approaches with a balanced review of their strengths and weaknesses.Moreover, the book is written in a wry, personal, occasionally very funny tone, and was fun to read. The practice hands are extremely deep and well-explained.One minor complaint (also noted by another reviewer) is that there are a number of mildly irritating typos and grammar errors; I'm the sort of person who gets annoyed at such things, though, and it didn't hamper my enjoyment of the book.I eagerly await the second volume."
5,WOW! This book is really good,"After reading the super system, I did not find any good book on Hold'em and I have read many like David Sklansky among many others but I really wasted my time and money until now, This book is really good book that covers all aspect from position to bets, besides styles and many other things that super system and other books do not have, believe me this is the book that you have been looking for. I cannot wait for volumen II."
5,Very educational.,I have learned so much about playing poker from this book. Hopefully I will also learn to be a better poker player.
4,"Good, heavy on the situational","I have enjoyed reading Mr. Harrington's tips and strategies. It has definitely given me some insight into approaching tournament hold 'em. I did think it was a bit heavy on the situational descriptions, but I was able to pick up the main points. I would recommend for someone who has played hold 'em in a recreational way, but looking to start playing some tournaments."
5,Nice change of pace,"I've been assembling and refining the same deck for about 2 years now, just pulling out some old ones and adding new, every once in a while. Most of my deck is dragons and dark monsters. I decided to get Spellcaster's Judgment just to have an alternate deck for every once in a while, and it's refreshing to have it, plus, there are some pretty cool monsters in there. I only duel with my 9YO son, so I don't need some ""killer"" deck, and this is just fine."
2,What a book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This wasnt my favorite book of the ""Polly"" series, but I really enjoyed finding out what happened to all the charecters, mostly Polly.I wonder why the author made Jasper be their uncle? It doesnt seem right for Polly to marry her uncle, even if he was her age, and not related by blood, but by marriage.Ive also noticed about the books that the Five Little Peppers scream and cry and dance and twirl and spin and shout very often. People are always geting hurt ,not on purpose, all the time. in this book, i think Polly broke her arm in a train wreck.But Im glad there was one last book about the dear Pepper family. i wish i could find out what happen to the rest of the clan though.Well good luck. Read this bookVERY WELL formated for KINDLE."
4,Nice Set!,"I was very pleased with the set, and the quality, nice heavy, big dishes. My husband is from Ireland and likes the mugs, very nice size for tea or coffee. I was only dissapointed to see on the back of the plates ""Made in China"", however it does include the Pfaltzgraff name on the back and the name of the set ""Circle of Kindness"", my only reason for giving it four stars, I would prefer it was made in the US, can't recall it stating this was made in China in the description, or if this informaiton was left off."
5,Student of Spanish at university.,If only my text books were this straight-forward and simple!This is the best Spanish teaching book that I have ever seen.All you have to do is read the words that are orgainized into their natural groupings! It's that simple! It's almost instant!
5,An awesome novel about an awesome God,"Sometimes Christian novels can be a bit too other worldly, a bit too trite and often a bit dubious theologically. Here is an amazing book that tells of God transforming one man and changing a community, all cunningly bounded in an exposition of John 15 (which I'd always found hard going in getting beyond the obvious). It may only be a novel, but it challenges as much as any biography and teaches as much as any hardcore theology books. (See also ""When the Spirit comes"" by the same author)"
5,Swanson's canned white meat chicken,"My last order came in cans with the pull top. It is good and I have used it for casseroles, sandwiches, and salads. I put it on the automatic shipment thing, so I must like it fine, wouldn't you say? I let my spoiled pooch have it for a very special treat once in awhile and he adores it! Expensive dog food, eh?I don't know whether it is a bargain or not. I have not priced it in the markets. I am getting it regularly now for the convenience. It arrives promptly in pristine condition."
2,Ambiguous product!,"I love buying stuff online: food, clothes, books, whatever--anything I need, I'd rather get it online than deal with driving to a store, finding out they don't have what I want, driving elsewhere, carrying around a lot of heavy stuff, and so on and so forth.That's why it makes me angry beyond all measure when a company abuses the partial anonymity of the online marketplace to sell two different products under the same label.In this case, I can look back at my Amazon purchase records and find that I have ordered this exact item twice. But when I look in my kitchen, I see two different products: one is a can with a pull-top, while the other requires a can opener and appears to contain meat of a different quality.Generally, I recommend the pull-top cans. But you have no way of knowing what you are getting: beware!"
4,DPW,I made two mistakes when I bought this collection. It is the second of two sets and it is only available in Japanese with subtitles. I hate reading subtitles and my japanese language skills are limited. Maybe I will think better of it when my understanding of Japanese language improves.
2,The DVD's quality was not good,We were not able to see the complete movie as the movie was stuck in the middle and was not able to watch it.
5,I love it!,"I bought the CD after being awed with the music that I heard on the recent TV series on russian history. The cd is encaptivating, mixing classical with newer sounds. The best way to describe it is just listen for yourself, I for one, would really recommend it."
4,Better without the narration,I really liked the History Channel documentary RUssia Land of the Tsars. But I thought there was too much talking. I liked what I heard of the music so I decided to take a chane and buy it. It is a really great listening experience. Fun to listen from beginning to end. My only wish is that there were less pieces and each was longer. Has this composer done other films?
1,Poor quality garden light.,"These are pretty garden lights. BUT break easily. The metal rod breaks off from the plastic stem of fixture stake. This pastic fixture stake, once in the ground, is supposed to support the metal light fixture. There is no way to repair it."
3,Reading with Tequila,"Why read: Enjoyed Brave New WorldWhat impressed me: I loved the concept of Huxley writing essays commenting on how the things he wrote about long ago in Brave New World translated into modern life.What disappointed me: Unfortunately, modern life isn't what it once was. While Huxley drew parallels between things he created and that which ended up actually occurring in the course of his lifetime, his lifetime ended over 50 years ago, making the book less than accurate. Things he foresaw coming to pass soon never did and things have changed in ways he never imagined or at least mentioned.Recommended: Not really. Too much time has past since Huxley wrote Revisited and it just doesn't hold up given modern developments."
5,Predictions Come True,"If you're trying to understand how our country you got into the predicament that were in. this book will show you how it happened. Is another instance where art predicts the future. Revisited shows how Hitler accomplished his takeover of Germany.And how big business using the very same techniques taken over our government. How they Corrupted every facet of our government. How even the Supreme Court has fallen under their spell.It is a fascinating read! I purchased my copy on Kindle, and I have read it three times. Each time I discover another truism.Ron Mahon"
4,BNWR,"I like this book better than Huxley's first installment of Brave New World. However, for a skinny book the asking price was too much. Other than that, if you're into science fiction and other dystopian novels this is a great read."
5,The world is ripe to take Mr. Huxley more seriously,"Mr. Huxley started warning us in 1932, with his masterpiece, ""Brave New World."" In this essay-style analysis of his own book, written twenty-six years later, he takes it one big step further. Addressing everything from overpopulation to overorganization, his words ring more true with every passing year. Our society needs to lift its head from the computer screen for a few hours to read this critical work. Few, if any, have said so much in so little space. Mr. Huxley is one of the greatest thinkers of the twentieth century, and it is a criminal shame that his words are not more widely read. We should put down our endless self-help manuals and learn where our ills really begin. We need to understand how the roots serve the tree before we can improve upon the tree. Mr. Huxley is an expert gardener..."
2,Not like the regular Bob the Builder videos.,"This video was ok only. It was not a story like the regular Bob the Builders, it was sorta documentary like. My son still enjoyed it, but I was disapointed enough to not buy any other ""on site"" videos."
5,Bob the Builder On Site DVD,"This Bob the Builder On Site DVD shows how skyscrapers are built. My 4 year old grandson likes it very much. It combines animation with real life scenes. It is educational, interesting, and entertaining."
4,Good Movie...Keeps his attention,"My son enjoys watching this video. There are excellent real construction scenes mixed in with Bob and his crew. My only complaint is that they reused a bunch of the ""real"" footage in the different segments but that doens's seem to bother my son."
1,"NOISE, NOISE, NOISE,",This moden is the noisest thing I have ever heard. I used it on my computer for the answering machine and i can hardly hear the messages that are recorded. I give it one star only because it does work.
2,Not reliable as a faxmodem,"Apparently compatibility specs with windows on fax-modems are with regard to the data portion of the modem and not necessarily the fax side. The modem would send faxes w/out problems. However, it failed to detect a ringing phone to receive a fax unattended. All was ok if someone was always around to tell the modem when to start receiving, but that's not what we were looking for in a fax machine replacement. So I can't speak to the data operability of this modem, but if you're looking for fax, I'd look elsewhere."
2,No Caller ID as claimed,"This may be a great modem, but it doesn't provide Caller ID as I expected. While it does provide caller ID as part of Modem-On-Hold, it doesn't provide it for every incoming call. If you check out this product on the zoom web page, it says* Caller-ID. No caveats or mention of Modem-On-Hold. This is false advertising, so I'm returning my modem."
5,GREAT product!,"I bought this swimsuit for my 4 1/2 year old grandson - it was worth EVERY penney and MORE! Unlike some other models that appear to be the same, THIS SWIM SUIT is the BEST - it keeps his head above the water - when he jumps in - it brings him upright to the water surface. He LOVES it - makes him feel secure, where before he was afraid of the water. Just make sure they understand that they can't do everything WITHOUT this suit that they do with it, unless they know how to swim!!! Thanks for the GREAT product! His friends and their parents wanted to know where he got it!"
3,How is this suppose to fit???,"I got this product in hope that it would fit my 20mos son. But when I had my son try this on, he looked like a turtle in a shell. Don't know if that's how he is suppose to look, but I wish I had some pictures to show me how this swimsuit is suppose to fit."
1,TOO BIG FOR BABY BOY 30LB,"WELL, IT SEEM TO GOOD ALL OVER, THE STYLE , THE MATERIAL, THE FABRIC, EVERYTHING VERY GOOD, ONLY COMPLAIN THAT IT TOO BIG, BULKY FOR BABY 30LB."
4,Heavy duty,"I selected these after reading several reviews. I use hand exercisers as I jog, a half hour a day, 50 reps at a time then change position. I've used a few products before, all with plastic handles. They usually lasted 2-3 years before the handles would fail. This time I sought out something more durable. The reviews made me question the right weight to select, I was afraid the 100 lbs. would be too easy. But I do a lot of reps and I'm glad I didn't get heavier ones. The handles are grooved metal and will tear up the skin on your hands until you develop calluses or wear gloves. I'm curious to see how long they will last but I feel pretty confident that they will outlast any of my previous ones."
4,Quality product,This item is made completely of sturdy metal and the knurled grip does not slip in your hand at all. 100 lbs is not as hard to squeeze as I anticipated and I regret not starting with the 150 lb one instead.
3,poor knurling,"This product seems pretty solid. Unfortunately, the knurl smoothed out almost immediately on one of the handles making it rather slick. I would've returned it, but I had hurt my wrist, set it on the side when it arrived, and forgot about it. By time I finally got to use it and realized the knurling was poor, I figured it was too late to send it back. It has also developed a squeak, but is not too bothersome. I'll have to try a drop of oil on the spring. I'm breaking out the 200 now and I'll see how those knurls hold up."
5,Hand grip,"The 100 lb hand grip is very light weight for me, but it let me know how much I have increased the power in my forearm"
2,Not very good,"These handgrips are poorly made. They are not at all what the description says. I purchased the 200 and they are as easy to work out with as the cheap ones you buy at a department store. Very, very disappointed"
5,Ooooo WEE!!,Just got the 350 a few days ago...half way to closing it. I have had some pretty good ones but this one is the best...texture...and durable...lets see if I break this one from over use like the others.
5,Seems OK,This product was given as a gift based upon the recipient's wish list. When he got it he was happy with it and said he was confident it would be just what he wanted.
3,Crud but good,The product is very crud and since it is heavy the handles are very rough and you will need gloves if you want a serious workout with it. I would expect a more refine handles. The spring make noise while contracted. pretty much a rudimentary product
3,good product but really used and scratched but it works,good item but lots of wear and tear. will buy from again but next time include more details on used products
4,Great bargain!,"The item feels to be of high build quality and it is reasonably priced. My only issue is it gets a bit slippery when you sweat. Other than that its a great item to have. Btw this item is also quite tough to workout with, maybe I should have started with an easier level like the 150, I would have to say this is definitely a long-term workout item."
5,Grip training beyond the plastic handled devices.,"I love the way the machined gnarled handles feel, although you can count on the formation of calluses.I first purchased the 200, and found it to be too difficult for a full range of motion. I next purchased the 150 and feel this is a resistance I can train with. I would not mind having a set of 100's for warm ups and multiple reps. These are great tools to keep handy in the car for quick forearm workouts."
1,weaker than CoC,"I bought this gripper thinking it would be tougher to close than the trainer (100 lbs)of the CoC brand. Even though this product was rated for 150 lbs of resistance it was easier to close than the 100 lbs CoC. I feel ripped off, returning this as soon as I can."
2,Southern Heritage Pies and Pastry Cookbook,"I am elated to be able to add this book to my collection that I started many years ago when these book were first offered thru mail-order. I refused the Pie & Pastry Cookbook, thinking I would learn from my Mother. She died before she could teach me all her wonderful pie making secrets. These are the only Cookbooks that any one needs in their Collection...That is if you love Southern Cooking!! Who doesn't?? Thank you for providing me this book and the super fast shipping. It was a pleasure to purchase from you."
3,An odd collection...,"I say that because this is simply two previous releases inexplicably rolled into one and repackaged & renamed. CD1 is the collection called Colin Blunstone Sings His Greatest Hits. The songs are, by the way, RE-RECORDINGS, a fact the package doesn't reveal to you until after you've opened it and read the booklet or listened to the CD. I felt a bit ripped off by this, but the music is good nevertheless. CD2 is Colin's late-90's solo effort, The Light Inside--a decent album if you like 80's-style pop.Anyway, since no one else has reviewed this item, I thought it'd be best if I did just so anyone else who is considering purchasing this collection knows exactly what it is."
2,"Cool, but poor construction","These headphones are resole under diffrent names over and over. Let me tell you something, they are expensive and are [bad]. Sure it vibrates but if you feel the construction there is something wrong. Fake wire stoppers, bad middle unit position, weak screws, [bad] hardware overall. Do not get this unless you like RMAs."
2,Pretty faucet has maintenance issues,"We have had this type faucet for 4 years now. The design of the body requires 3 separate large rubber o-rings to keep water from leaking out from the top and bottom. These need regular re-greasing with silicon grease or the faucet is hard to turn, and leaks small amounts of water which lead to mold and discoloration. This gets worse over time. I have replaced the o-rings in the hopes that things would get better, but it was only a slight improvement. It's just not a practical design. My wife hates this faucet!!!"
1,Company does not stand behind their product,"We have a Newport brass kitchen set in our house that is only 4 years old and the spray head is leaking. Absent the original invoice for the faucet set the company will not stand behind their product. Needless to say their 10 year guarantee is worthless. Considering the premium price they charge for their products, their customer support is horrific. Avoid like the plague."
4,Good for Germans to understand how others might see them,"Very funny, and very true. This is also a great helper for Germans to understand how others (non-Germans) might see and perceive them, and of course it's quite useful for non-Germans to understand German behaviors and habits in a better way.But: Some observations are a bit outdated as things changed during the past 10 - 20 years, and globalization finally arrived in Germany as well (and frankly speaking: There is not the ""one specific German culture"", there are many!).So you should take everything really literally, but nevertheless you get a better feeling for ""these strange German ways""."
2,Alan Paton: an acquired taste,"It's been almost 30 years since I read Cry, the Beloved Country and I'd forgotten how strangely Paton structures his books. This novel gives us some excellent insights on how sick a society South Africa was in the 1950's. However it's an extremely difficult read; shifting between past and present tense, dialogs were the author doesn't explain which characters are speaking, a great many references that are unclear to readers who know little about South Africa. Another reviewer called the novel ""docu-fiction"". That's exactly what it is. It has no protagonists. We learn very little about who these characters are and have trouble caring about them, aside from the grief inflicted on them by hateful Afrikaners. This was Paton's last novel. He was pushing 80 when he wrote it. He still had plenty to say. His ideosyncratic story telling detracts from the message."
4,These replacements work fine,These work fine for a replacement. Just beware that the holes don't always line up with your previous holes. I had to re-drill two new holes because they didn't line up. Otherwise they make a great replacement.
3,Not What I was Expecting,"I've been listening to Greenie and Golic for years so I know the whole schtick. I guess when I bought this book though, I was expecting more insight about the radio program or about Mike's past experiences as a sports journalist. I definitely wasn't expecting a recap of his diary that he wrote on his psychiatrist's instructions. He came across as rich, pompous, and arrogant. It's certainly a different feel from the guy I listen to every weekday."
1,Things you should know before you buy this!,"I used to listen to his show every day, but after reading the book, I can't bring myself to hear his voice... I for one was disappointed that the ""book"" was a compilation of his therapy journals. I had always considered Greenie a sort of 'everyman' sportscaster... a real fan with a real fan's perspective. Now, I consider him to be a self serving pompous sportscaster like the rest of them. ""everyman"" would never refer to himself continuously as ""a little famous,"" and a neighbor of billionaires, and certainly would never have the unmitigated gall to compare an internet rumor about himself to the fan adulation received by Bo Jackson! If you really want to read this, get on the waiting list at your library, borrow it from a friend or at least wait until the paperback."
1,Not sure who this book is written for,"I occasionally catch Mike & Mike on ESPN2 and usually enjoy the show. Since I don't watch the show that often I didn't realize the Greeny was such a diva. I mean every time I see him on TV he has on a casual shirt over a t-shirt and a pair of jeans...kind of like what Ray Ramano wore on ""Everybody Loves Raymond"". He seems like an ""everyguy"" and I enjoy his wit. But....in this book he comes across as very shallow. Why, because he constantly has to punctuate his stories with design-label name dropping, as if he's looking for affirmation....and whose affirmation would that be, the fans of Mike & Mike (NO!)...so who? Which leads me to the question, who is this book written for anyway?All in all the Greeny comes across as someone who doesn't have much meaningful to say. Like many other reviewers I find him spoiled, privileged and out of touch with the REAL people who watch/listen to his show."
3,Would have liked more sports,"People listen to Greenberg and Golic's radio show mostly for the sports talk, not to hear about Greeney's family life. While some of his off-air activities are amusing, I wanted more of the book to be about sports. Mike thinks the public likes hearing his metrosexual talk and off-air stuff more than they actually do.Incidentally, to the reviewer below, screen name ""DJK ver 2.0"", this book in NOT a novel. It is non-fiction."
3,maybeline wrong colour,"i ordered light 3 and recieved two different colours even thought the bottle said light 3 ,i could tell by comparing it with a bottle i had at home."
4,In Search of Ghosts,"When I was a student at Hammel-Actual Business School in 1975 and 1976, I thought I read every book Hans Holzer ever wrote. But I was passing B. Dalton Booksellers in the Mall at Sierra Vista and saw this book from the corner of my eye on the sales rack. I did not remember seeing this book so I bought it. And somehow I had missed this book back in 1976! I have to say that, although the book is good, it is not up to the Hans Holzer standards I remember from 32 years ago. It does not have the scientific inquiry approach I remember from the other books. It is more simply stories of investigations of ghosts."
2,Disappointed for the Money,"This item is ok . . . maybe it's just me, but we have had some issues with it. It was ok at first (age 1), because my son couldn't reach the pedals, and his feet just kind of dangled. But as he got a little older, he always seemed at a loss with what to do with his feet. (There's nowhere to rest them.) He would try to rest them on the pedals, and inevitably jam them with his foot. Now he can reach the pedals (age 2), but hasn't mastered them yet. But his feet are dragging the ground. I guess I can raise the seat up, but this still won't solve his dangling problem. Secondly, the canopy and cup holder are useless, and our bike doesn't steer particularly straight, even though we have tried to correct this. My sister's son is same age as mine, and she has the same problems. It is very cute, and we always get compliments on it, but is not nearly as functional. Wish I had gotten something else."
4,Great Product,"Overall it is a great product. Thank you guys for the reviews.Pro:1) trike and parts are very sturdy.2) seat is adjustable, useful as your kids grow bigger.3) color is wonderful.4) bi-pilot system feels great.Con:1) attentions are needed to assembly, e.g. you need to be VERY careful on installing tyres to their correct sides, because there is no remedy if you put wrong.2) you need to have strong fingers to remove the pull handle.3) the canopy is of no use.4) need to mark your trike to separate from others who have the same trike. :DSuggestions:The best way to assembly is first to layout the parts on the ground to their relative location, and then assembly them. Enjoy!"
4,Very good - but I don't use the canopy,I've had this for months now. It's a fun toy that is generally well built but not perfect. The canopy is more trouble than it's worth and I've had some minor issues with the pins that hold the steering but overall it's worthy of 4 stars. The seat is adjustable for growing legs. The handle for the parents is great and gives easy control.
4,RF Ultimate Canopy Steering Trike a Decent Buy,"What others have said about the canopy and cup holder is true -- these are worthless. (Don't even put them on.) BUT, the inflatable tires make the upgrade to the ULTIMATE worth the extra bucks. You could spend an additional $140 to get the Kettler Mac-Daddy Benz of trikes, and it would likely be a higher-quality machine, but you'd have spent over $200 on a tricycle for your two-year-old. If you like what that says about you, here you go: [...]If you'd rather get your kid a decent trike without having it do your bragging, the RF Ultimate is a decent choice."
4,Best trike for the money!,"I bought this trike for my just turned 2 year old that is the size of an average 4 year old and it fits her great!! I was hesitant to buy her a trike because of her size but this one works perfect. For reference she is 37 1/2 inches tall. It will probably last only a year but that is fine, she was definitely not ready for a bike with training wheels. It was difficult to put together and the child needs a place to put their feet besides the pedals when you are pushing them. My husband also did not have a problem pushing her in the trike because in the past strollers are too low for him because of his height. The canopy is useless too! So overall this trike is a great find."
2,Fun At First but then hard to fix,"My kids loved this bike until it got a flat tire in the front. The back tires you can fill with a regular pump, but the front tire is special and I was told to fill it at a gas station. I tried but it didn't work. I am trying to find a replacement tube b/c I fear it may be flat but am having a VERY hard time finding it. The design on this bike is stupid. Why make it so hard to fix! I am very disappointed and I expect more for the price I paid."
4,Nice features but room for improvement,"This tricycle has nice features such as parental steering, bell for child to ding, and storage box. Though the age range for the toy is from 2 to 5 years old some children may be too small to reach the pedals - the seat is not very adjustable. This can be disappointing if you are intending to help your child learn to pedal as it then becomes nothing more than a fancy stroller. It seems a little expensive, but if you can get it on sale (and maybe pass on the sun shade) it may be well worth the cost."
3,Peg holes don't match up on 2002 VW Jetta.,"I purchased these under the impression that it was an exact fit for my Jetta. While the mats fit well in place, the holes for the pegs designed to keep the mats in place don't line up. Otherwise, they're good quality mats. I would've given them a 5 if the pegs lined up."
3,Novel of ideas,"A novel about the French Revolution. More a novel of ideas than of action and character. The opposing ideas are interesting, but the characters lack rounded complexity."
1,This is an addendum,"Sent word to Amazon that this battery did not fit the Motorola i530. (Got message right on the phone screen that the battery was incompatable. The connection part is different the the factory-installed battery). Amazon said that they would forward the message to the company from which it was purchased. Have heard nothing.Remember the old adage, you can't get something for nothing. Spend the money and go to directly to Motorola for replacement parts."
2,It's all in the eye of the beholder,"I borrowed this book from the library, and I'm very glad I did as I would hate to have spent money for it.If you like a contemporary mid-managerial approach to photography, then by all means, enjoy this book... I know nothing about Fremier, but the book has all the popuar buzz word approaches to ""managing"" your photography and solving ""problems"". If you just like photography as a hobby, and pursue it for pleasure, try another book."
1,Nothing That's Not In Other Books,"There's nothing in this book that isn't in many other photography books. Much of the book is taken up with definitions and discussion of equipment and techniques, rather than approaches to creativity (as is implied by the sub-title of the book). The photos are far from inspiring. I didn't learn anything from this book."
2,Poor Quality,"I bought these bowls in hoping to use them as mixing bowls or serving dishes to match the entire rest of the set I have. I went to use them to serve vegetable(potatoes) in and when I put a metal spoon in and stirred it left scratches all in the bowl. The color completely came off and they would not replace them for me.I am very disappointed and now am using Pfaltzgraff, at least it does not scratch off the color when serving or mixing. Do not waste your money on these poor quality bowls."
1,Unreliable,Simulators and Controllers book sellers are undependable and do not respond to e-mail. I plan to turn this meager order as fraud to the attorney general's office in Nebraska. Maybe we will get the book some year. Amazon.com needs to drop these idiots for just failing to respond to customer questions.
4,Armchair Pilot's Wife Comments,"I purchased this FS 2004 for my husband, and it arrived on time. He was very happy with it, and says that the graphics are greatly improved over the 2002 simulator which he has been using for a year.Someday he hopes to have the FSX version which has even better graphics. (When he gets the computer upgraded).The only drawback, he says, is that the display panels on the instrument flagging didn't make a clear precise sign, For instance, the instrument panel, when clicked on with the mouse, resulted in the spelling running out in a line. Let's say he presses ""altimeter"". This is what happens:. ""altimetertivtimet"". He is not sure if it is a program problem with the disc or if it lies in our computer itself.The best way to keep a fellow happy who would like to fly and does not have the funds for an airplane, nor for flying lessons is the flight simulators. Thank God for them!An Armchair pilot's Wife!"
3,"Nice reference, not complete but a good start.","Decent book, worth a read. There is much information between the cover for the beginner, however like mentioned in other reviews, I wish there were more ""complete"" details. I too was saddened by the references to what already came with MS FS2004. It's rather frustrating when a guide doesn't stand ""on it's own"".Poor Sky King who posted here posted a review of the game here in error. (And yes, Sky, it is a game first, then a learning tool second.)"
2,Limited Use,Might be a good book for someone who is unfamiliar with MS Flight Sim. For me it was way too basic. Suggest you try something else if you have any experience with any MS Flight Sim.
1,Don't Waste Your Money - This Book is Not Worth it!,"While this book may be good for an absolute first timer, it is a total waste of money for a familiar user. I purchased it in hopes of learning how to properly use the instruments for approaches/landing and the control tower. All of the lessons in the book refer you back to the ""Learning Center"" (on your computer) - why even bother using this book. For someone looking to have a paper reference to coach them through something, this book is not it! I wanted a step by step lesson and it gave me ""try the Learning Center."" It also skips over a lot of the key steps and assumes you already know how to do certain things. What makes this book even worse is that it doesnt even provide a list of common commands. My advice: Don't Bother."
2,Nothing New Here,Nearly everything in the book is just a re-hash of information that is in the learning center section of Flight Simulator. More depth and breadth of information is needed to merit purchasing this book.
3,OK stuff if you don't want to read online manual.,"This book contains tens of pages about aircraft information which is easily obtainable from the internet. It does have some useful FS usage information, but even that can be obtained from the online manual.It is not a total waste though."
2,Nothing useful here...,"Although there are some interesting excercises in this book, it didn't have the extensive, detailed ""nuts & bolts"" information I was looking for. Each subject is a basic overview followed by ""see the learning center for more information"".I was hoping for detailed information on all controls and instruments, the information that's NOT found in the FS2004 learning center.In short, don't waste your money."
5,"Perfect, but not their best","Overcast is the perfect first album...not counting ""headshots""...that any hip hop group could release. It's been called ""life music"", and that pretty much sums it up. The beats are much more laid back than anything else that they've put out, and WAY less...""emo""...for lack of a better word. Spawn isn't up to par with slug, but very few people are, so its not a very big deal, and he doesn't stand out or anything. All the songs are amazing, well produced, and essentially perfect. but again, this is not atmosphere's best. Lucy Ford is by far the ultimate atmosphere cd. but even still, this album is not mediocre..or anywhere remotley close to that. buy this now and cry tears of joy"
2,self titled,"great album, more punchlines than i am used to in slugs flows but that added humor had me laughing at stuff that shouldn't be funny..."
5,Old School Underground at its Finest,"Listen to true a hip-hop head when I say it doesn't get better than this. This album is what underground hip-hop should be like. Slug has the [most awesome]lyrical style with the rhymes to back it up. His use of words and phrases put all others to shame. And he is at his best on this album. Spawn is [awesome]their voices mix perfectly. They are complimented by hardcore oldschool beats from ANT. To all heads who are reading, this is true hip-hop."
3,"Great Card, But Overpriced","This is a great card. I am very happy with my purchase of it back in January '06. The only reason for the 3 star rating is due to it's price. $485 is just too much for a second tier card. The 7900GTX is only $520, and is much more powerful than the 7800GTX. At this point, do yourself a favor and get the 7900GTX."
2,Not what it appears to be,"I bought these, and the concept is better than the delivery. When you fix it the box only looks 1/3 full. Makes me wonder why they did not just use a smaller box. Anyway the flavor was OK, but the salt is a little high for me."
2,Back to the test kitchen please!!!!,"I wanted to love this sooo badly. I adore red curry noodles. They desperately need to revamp the recipe. You can eat this, but you won't enjoy it much. Definitely do not buy without trying a single pack first."
1,"Noodles, yes but Thai red curry this is NOT!","I have had red curry in many places, both in the US and abroad and this is nothing like the real thing. There is hardly any curry or coconut flavors, and in fact it tastes more like pine sap than anything else. I followed the stove top directions (cooking food in cardboard seems weird to me) and was slightly put off by the aromas. They weren't horrible, but didn't smell like curry either. At first bite, my heart sank. I was expecting a rich, tongue-wrenchingly spicy red curry, and all I got was an artificially thickened, oddly pine needle tasting and not very spicy concoction. There are much better choices if you want easy, microwaveable lunches."
1,these taste like cr@p,"I just cooked these up in a pan on the stove. They tasted kinda ""okay"" for a few minutes. But since they needed to cool I put them down for a few minutes. When I tried them again, the taste was horrible.I am open to a drop in flavor over a genuine homemade curry noodle dish, but this is just awful. I will eat a thousand packs of oodles of noodles or ramen noodles before I ever try this again. Yuck! I can't believe this product made it out of the test kitchen. Yeah....it's that bad."
3,Heat with a bit of flavor,"I've been looking for a substitute for standard Ramen Noodle lunches so I figured I'd try these. They aren't bad, but the red curry noodles didn't seem to have much flavor. They do have a perfect amount of heat for me. I think that theA Taste of Thai Peanut Noodles Quick Meal, 5.25-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)were a little better due to the flavor and texture added by the peanuts, but they are both still edible. I think theSimply Asia Noodle Bowl, Spicy Kung Pao, 8.5-Ounces (Pack of 6)noodles are significantly better though."
1,The most disgusting thing I have ever tasted,"I did not buy these on Amazon. I just picked up a couple of boxes in the store. I thought they might taste pretty good but boy was I wrong. They have a terrible smell and taste even worse. I thought I was eating some sort of poison. I ate two bites, only because I couldn't believe how bad it was the first bite. I think I would rather starve then have to eat these noodles. Only gave it one star because I had to."
3,"not as good as the other taste of thai noodles, but not bad either","I bought these for variety mainly. Both the peanut and coconut ginger flavours are strong favourites, though it's nice to mix it up once in awhile. I have to agree with the other reviewers that this tastes nothing of curry and is a bit on the bland side, but I wouldn't go so extreme as to say it tastes like trash. It does smell of fish, which, if you aren't used to, may be offputting. It is much healthier and tastier than common ramen noodles, but there are better flavours out there. I wouldn't recommend this particular flavour to anyone who's trying taste of thai noodle for the first time."
2,Must be an acquired taste,"The fish sauce used for this one is REALLY strong - it overpowered everything else. I like the Coconut Ginger one and Thai Peanut a lot, though, and they're both gluten free, too."
5,Great product. Inexpensive.,"This is an excellent product. Similar ones from other companies are 2 to 3 times more expensive. The software is also great. Easy to install, a lot of functions, and it is free! You should download and test the software first to make sure it works on your PDA. The only thing is that I wish this device would work on a Palm!"
5,A jaw dropping masterpiece,"There are very few albums that can totally rearrange your ideas about music. This album along with Highway 61 Revisited, Pet Sounds, Swordfishtrombones, In a Silent Way, and East of the River Nile totally changed how I perceive music. A landmark album and easily one of the greatest instrumental albums ever recorded!"
4,trident,Product was as listed...shipping seemed a bit excessive for size and wt of product...could have gotton it for the same price by the time I paid shipping...saved me having to leave the house I guess
5,trident gum,I have to order this gum online as it is not sold in the stores in my area. trident cinnamon gum
4,Very pleased,I am very happy I was able to find this gum. It is not availble in this area. The price was the best I could I find and the shipment was rather fast.
5,More phones should use this concept.,"I love the dual battery concept. If you need the power stick it on, otherwise leave it off. It gives me so much more functionality than just having one battery. I can have this on me all day, and then take it off for a dinner date at night so my phone fits invisibly in my pocket. It gives you at least twice the power as the normal battery alone. I can go on a two day trip without my charger with this battery. It is not heavy at all, but it does bulk up the phone some. I still wear it on my belt without noticing it though. I highly recomend this if you need the power."
2,Martha Stewart meets Maine!,"Terry Silber deserves credit for making her move to Maine work. It should be noted that farming is not the reason for her success, retail would be more accurate. Throughout the book there is the feeling that she feels herself above her new neighborhood. I would be curious to see how her new homestate views her. A finacial success; she has achieved. Beyond that?"
3,Soap injecter,"Well, it was easy to install, but I found that once the injecter was adjusted to suck up the soap, the pressure drop was more than I was anticipating. I was dissapointed in the performance."
5,Farscape was the bomb (or La Bomba!),"As fans and even casual TV views have asked, how could the SciFi network keep Stargate SG-1 and dump this gem of a show? It was only 12 episodes away from achieving syndicated status when it was cancelled in 2003. These last 4 episodes certainly are memorable. In the 'Were so Screwed' trilogy, John Crichton builds a tiny atom bomb and goes to a secret Scarren base to rescue Aeryn Sun. The acting, writing, cinematography, and SFX are all top-notch in what is arguably the best 3-part story in the series. The show's humor is what made it so appealing and entertaining. With subtle nods to Blake's 7, Star Trek, and Star Wars, Farscape still became an original and innovative sci-fi adventure. This set completes the release of all 88 original episodes on DVD. Despite some horrible packaging decisions for seasons 1-3, the 5 DVD sets for Seasons 3 & 4 have all been winners for ADV Video. I can't recommend this enough to anyone who enjoyed this show."
4,Reversing Hypertension,"Causality is very important in recovering/healing from disease. Preventiion, Treatment and Reduction are lifelong goals."
5,Solving the mystery`,This book is a wealth of information whether you chose to follow it or stay within the conventional medical system. At the absolute least this book provides information to allow you to be in charge of your 'own' health care on this important issue. A best it can provide you with a safer and healthier natural alternative to unsafe and ineffective medications. I have bought 4 copies of this books and given it to people I care about.
1,Hypertension book.,This is the wrong message based on theory and speculations. Facts are confusing and not backed up by good controlled data. Ther are numerous less well publicized but more scientific books available on this subjectsee hypertensionfoundation.org for simple accurate information
4,Narrative approach to learning symbolic logic,"Apart from a couple of typos that will make some of the explanations of Frege's system difficult for those not already familiar with symbolic systems, this is another excellent effort by Anthony Kenny. Unlike his book on Wittgenstein that was much more of a biography, this book really concentrates on the symbolic system. This will be a good read for students studying advanced symbolic or mathematical logic."
4,Soft porn telling,"Beautiful bodies of young women and self-services of male students ground a story of lustful dad, young one from contemporary approach himself, very much.Good viewing after midnight as a prelude to more active actions."
5,"A really excellent novel, outstanding","From the very start of the novel, I couldn't take my eyes off it. It is a psychological tale, but also talks about feminism and many other things. What impressed me most was the way in which Atwood describes Elaine's feelings, like if it was herself. It really is a good book, and -I'm not exaggerating- it makes the reader realise some important things about life. Besides, it goes deep into human feelings. It's worth reading."
2,I couldn't finish it.,"I gave it a fair shot, but it never really grabbed my interest. I still may try some of her other titles."
4,A Parallel Universe,"The predominant environment of this novel is enveloped by the mud and by a sad autobiography of a child with a father interested predominantly in its works and an absent mother.The main character are Cordelia, a cruel friend and a Cat's eye as a perfect surrogate of her parents.CheersItalo"
2,Bright points more evident the first time around,"I first read Cat's Eye about four years ago. I loved it then, which was why I picked it up again when I had to write a major paper. The second time around, the book seemed pretentious, and self-indulgent. The character of Elaine, who had seemed so strong the first time I read it was reduced to a one-dimensional weakling.There are always bright spots, however, when reading Margaret Atwood. One of these is her poetic style. (I hate her poetry, but the translation of that same style in her prose is more enjoyable).I wish that I hadn't read Cat's Eye a second time. My opion of Ms. Atwood and her work would have remained more complimentary. I would recommend Cat's Eye to adolescents around the age of sixteen or to those readers who are not looking to read with a critical eye.My suggestions, if you are looking for a novel by Margaret Atwood, are The Handmaid's Tale and Alias Grace -- both better expressions of her talent."
4,I DON'T SYMPATHISE WITH ELAINE !!!,I read this book for my A- level course and i enjoyed it. Atwood is a very talented writer and this book is evidence. But i can honestly say that i don't sympathise with Elaine. Cordelia seems to give a reason as to why she bullied Elaine (not that that means she should have) but Elaine had no reason to bully Cordelia herself. She took advantage of Cordelia's deterioration .Everything is in her mind...... and she is a psyco. But the book is very interesting and i don't regret reading it
4,Excellent-A disturbing look at the relationships women have,"I really enjoyed Cat's Eye by Margret Atwood. I found it to be not only an intersting look at women's relationships with other women, but I also thought it dealt with how early relationships in life effect a woman's relationships with men. The writing was excellent, and the imagry was absolutely haunting"
4,engaging,"The Cat's Eye by Margaret Atwood is one of those books that really draws you in. Her description of Elaine's childhood paints a vivid experience for the reader.At times almost disturbing, the story of her childhood memories and journey to overcome them was great. I am not a huge suspense type fan, for a book to keep me engaged through to the end is an accomplishment in and of itself. @herbookreviews"
4,Cat's eye seen through my eye,"This amazingly close to home account of a young girls struggle to try and fit in with her ""friends"" as they torment her is chilling. This novel is riviting I could not bring myself to put it down. Margret Atwood delivered with her amazing account of Elaine's persona and along with the encouragable Grace and Carols persona, were spectacular, and in your face. Atwood's attempt to put a little humanity in Cordelia's persona was not greatly accepted by myself. I will always veiw Cordelia as a coniving, vendictive,pretentious little girl who takes pleasure in seeing others squirm in her presence."
4,Emergence of an artist,"This was the gripping portrayal of a girl struggling to find a place in the treacherous world of young females who developed strength through her experiences and emerged as a successful artist.The vivid details of Elaine's return to her childhood home of Toronto and her recollection of growing up was insightful and, of course, beautifully written.While fighting the cruelty and games of pre-adolescent and teenage girls, Elaine was also trying to forge an identity and hold her own with parents and an older brother who all possessed a strong sense of self. She emerges as a confident woman, who has learned who she is and expresses both the pain and beauty of her experiences in art that is uncompromising."
4,Very good book,"I really loved the part of the book that delves into Elaine's childhood & the abuse she suffers at the hands of her ""friends""; I thought it was very convincing and realistic. Anyone who's been the victim of any kind of abuse (whether in their childhood or adulthood) will be able to relate; it is heartbreaking.I found it a tad boring once Elaine grew up; I've read 3 books by Atwood so far, and in 2 out of 3 of them, the adult characters bored me to tears. In this book I found the descriptions of the various artwork (done by Elaine and her friends) way too detailed. Maybe if I were an artist myself I would have been more interested. It just seemed overdone to me, and like she was trying too hard to be deep and ""abstract"" or something. Luckily, the rest of the book greatly compensated for this, in my opinion.Atwood's writing style is beautiful and poetic. I'm definitely not easily pleased with most books, but this one's a winner! My sister loved it too!"
5,"Great story, great reader","Kate Nelligan does a superb job reading the story, and the story works very well on audio."
2,Not my cup of tea,"This is a well written book, a page-turner; I like the details of Elaine's past and am interested in what viewpoints formed her as a person. However, I also think it is quite depressing. I read it a couple of times, years ago. When I saw a positive review on it I read it again, and each reading makes it more depressing. Her outlook is bleak, and I really don't see anything positive or uplifting about it."
2,Dull....drags on a bit. Not tied together well.,"This is a story of a woman growing up. The childhood friends that you have, the choices you make/the consequences, and how the past can haunt you. I have read two other books by Margaret Atwood and I liked this one the least. (Oryx and Crake, The Edible Woman) I feel the book was too long for the material covered. Also, the book talked about the children too much and the last half of the book has little to do with the first half. I wouldn't recommend. I also have a friend who read the book who had a different view of what the story was about (feminity/coming of age as a woman in a different time), but she also found the story to be lackluster."
1,"Pretentious, tedious and incredibly dull.","I had the experience of studying this book for A-level. It is full of uninteresting detail, its heroine is self-pitying. The novel is composed of incredibly long sentences with the occassional very short sentence that is obviouisly intended to be 'significant'. THe self conscious imagery and style make this one of the worst books that I have ever read/"
1,Frustrating Eyeball,"Horrible. You can't understand a thing. The writing has too much detail which is hard to follow. There are still questions unanswered. There are problems unsolved. This book is frustrating to read. A book that takes forever to read which seems more like an autobiography than a book to read for pleasure. This is a book to read just to say you have another book under your belt. There never is a climax, nothing is really solved. The book seems like a huge run-on sentence that has too many flashbacks. One can get lost going back and forth between past, present, and future. Maybe when I'm older I will understand the thoughts and flashbacks as an elderly woman, but right now this book seems like a waste of time."
1,Nostalgia ain't what it used to be,Material which is fresh and immediate in The Edible Woman loses its edge in this rehash of scenes from the Toronto of yesteryear. Retrospective wisdom and insight which might compensate for the loss of intensity is in depressingly short supply. A lazy and derivative book.
3,"brilliant writing, but a little slow and overly descriptive","Ms. Atwood is a tour de force. The give and take bullying in Cat's Eye is so brutal, I almost stopped reading it, except her writing is yet so marvelous, so smart. The other reason I slowed down was because of the over description and the slow pace of the book. For example, there's a scene where our little girl protagonist takes a marble out of her purse and puts it on her bureau and goes out. And I thought, wait, Ms. Atwood, aren't you going to describe where she puts the marble on the bureau so it doesn't roll off and what else is up there and how the light is falling and... you get the picture. It also had a bit too much Christian imagery for my tastes, although the science bits were great. Still, I'm in awe, and highly looking forward to my next Atwood tome."
3,Relationships,This was a wonderful read about the growing pains that most young women go through and the way that we learn to become functioning adults. I remember girls from my childhood that acted very much like Cordelia and Elaine. I think this would be a great book for girls in high school to read to give insight into their own world.
4,Checkov's Gun,"This book is beautifully written. Elaine's early experiences with Cordelia are pivotal to who she becomes. However, if you spend most of the novel waiting for Checkov's gun to go off, you will be disappointed. Thematically, I understand why it doesn't (the past is the past, etc.), but I still feel cheated and manipulated when the central reason for turning the page is a ruse."
1,A networker with a network that prohibits networking . .,"The Greatest Networker has a network that prohibits networking . . also claiming 10,000 guests.An exclusive inner circle elitist group that doesn't want to hear from anybody, all arrogant self proclaimed marketing genius's providing various snide comment messaging systems. A website devoted to selling their books. Great? I really don't think so!The 'greatest networker' discourages networking."
3,This is a Spanish Heavy Metal Band,"don't be fooled by the editorial review [as i was], this is not the usual Luis Salinas CD... this is a Spanish Language Heavy Metal band that Salinas apparently plays in- totally electric guitar music from start to finish... don't let Amazon mislead you on this one [as they did me]into buying this expecting one side of Salinas but getting another... Amazon- change your description of this CD so as not to mislead buyers like me..."
1,Not that hot,"could be a fairly good ""first draft"" of a book, but clearly not ready for publication. Many of the primary Oracle Forms features are not discussed at all and what is is done in a very confusing fashion. The entire book appears to be straight out of a word processor.For the money, a user would be far better off referring to the on-line documentation that comes with forms."
2,Riddled With Errors,"The workbook does a fair job of exposing the reader to Oracle forms, but there were errors on almost every page, which makes it extremely frustrating to figure out what was meant. You have to read between the lines. Also, the writer's style leaves a lot to be desired. For example, he says, ""what would happen if you were to do such and such"" and then 3 steps later you figure out that you were actually supposed to do that thing. Other times he presents you with this question, so you assume you're supposed to do what he says, and then later you realize you shouldn't have! No consistency whatsoever. I don't believe anyone proofread this book before it was published. There are literally hundreds of serious typos which leave you scratching your head. A current book on Oracle 9i forms is desperately needed."
1,"Buyer beware, Don;t buy this book, It is useless!","This is the worst computer book ever written, this book has numerous errors and is absolutely not helpful. I was very disapointed, it does not contain any text regarding oracle forms, no sample code, no explanation, no examples. Instead it contains a bunch of labs which the readers are suppose to complete themselves without any knowledge.Absolutely not recommended for studentsNot recommended for intermediate and advanced developer either, because it has not information about oracle forms.I ordered this via next day shipping, since I needed it urgently as I am taking an adavnced database course at university.I am returning this book immediately."
3,Horrible layout,"While this book is good for learning Oracle Forms 6i, and allows you to learn in the step-by-step as advertised, the layout of this book is horrendous. The chapters are literally 2-3 pages long. Then there are 3 pages of questions, followed by 20 pages of answers and their explanations. As another reviewer said, the questions asked are not meant to be known by the reader. Instead it's a quick way to make a point about what should be known, and then it's answered for you later. What I hate and got more and more frustrated by with each passing chapter, is that while the answers section of each chapter relist the question, it does not relist the steps you're supposed to do between each question. So while it would be nice to just skip the questions and go to the answers where the questions are anyway, you're constantly flipping back and forth to know what to do next. It's good to learn Forms 6i, but be warned that you're going to be frustrated by the format/layout."
1,This book was NOT helpful!!,"Don't let the reviews above fool you. They must be written by members of Prentice Hall. The book was NOT helpful. It was a nightmare trying to set up through Prentice Hall's Web Site to actually perform the labs. Furthermore, their Tech Support was (and is) a non-entity. Don't make the same mistake I did in buying this book."
2,Frustrating book...,"I bought this book for a co-worker and it did not help him. It is hard to find the right solution in this book. You are forced to perform the exercises and hope that the exercises provide you with the answers and skills you need to complete your work. I am a little disappointed in this book, because I was looking for a book that would teach me the basic and intermediate concepts of Forms."
3,Good coverage but frustrating,"Author covers all necessary aspects of forms development in a true hands on fashion. However, I found numerous inconsistencies between the text and sample data, references to topics not yet discussed and typos in the code."
1,The worst book ever,"This is the worst book ever written. It has so many errors in it that one would wonder if they even edited it before they decided to publish it. If you are smart you will not buy this book. In addition to all the errors, it is extremely hard to follow. There is almost NO text. The ""text"" consists of tedious exercises that teach you very little if anything at all. Each exercise contains very vague instructions and ""Test Your Thinking"" sections which rarely make any sense.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! YOU WILL REGRET IT!"

2,grass,"Well I did receive the seeds and in good condition, but i think you or they may have sold me regular grass . It is sprouting now and looks nothing like any Yucca I have ever seen in the wild.I hope I'm wrong."
4,Four Herrings for this book,This is a good book on the kernel.only thing lacking is Linux 2.6...guess it must be hard to write an Uptodate book on the kernel.
3,"Good detail, but very borring","This is very very borring. You need lots of pep pills to keep reading this day after day, and not really learning how to do something practical....just lots of theory stuff."
2,Amateurish Prose,"Don't believe the reviews! Contrary to the rave reviews this novel received on Amazon, I found the characters to be poorly developed and the plot very predictable. The pages were difficult to turn from the weight of the numerous cliches. I could not associate or sympathize with any of the characters and the plot was somewhat implausible. We all know that D-Day was a success and this story never had me in suspense that the landing in Normandy was jeopardized. I managed to slog through the story hoping for some form of redemption...wrong. If you want to read a poorly constructed, Jr. High level of writing, then this book is for you. Want to read intelligent spy and espionage stories? Try any novel by Alan Furst or Phillip Kerr"
2,No Real Hero or Heroine,"Hard to believe that a book about WWII could lack ANY thing significant to write about. There is no real hero, no real heroine, and one bad guy. The problem is that since the spy names/personas are being used, you don't know enough about the main female character to truly deel anything for her when she is in danger. Same goes with the main hero in the book."
4,Strong and gripping,"A very thrilling buildup to D day, 1944. Nice historical fiction. Good follow up to ""Preemptive Strike"", which I couldnt put down."
1,"the product description says many things,but not what this item is,","I do not own this item, but am angry that the Product description, doesn't describe the item in question. VERY Annoying! I love E.H. Products, but you fail to sell this one."
4,Celtic Daily Prayer review,"For anyone with Celtic roots, especially those who are Christian, or who resonate with Celtic spirituality, this book will provide the tools to immerse oneself in ageless prayers and timeless religious practice. The book can be used as a kind of devotional with prayers and readings for everyday. There are two complete sets of readings that can be used for morning and evening devotional time. The first part of the book contains outlines for prayer time in the morning, during the middle of the day and in the evening."
5,Another wonderful book by David Adam,"David Adam brings a holy hush to my day. I am able to set aside the worries and concerns of my world and enter into a peaceful existence. There is a holiness in these prayers that calms the soul and brings your heart back to God. Highly recommended, as are all his books."
3,Great addition to the series.,"""Mardi Gras Mambo"" has wonderful insider details about Carnival in New Orleans and a rip-roaring, action-filled conclusion.Fans of the series should certainly read this entry, but fans of gay mysteries or New Orleans mysteries should probably read the earlier two books first, in chronological order, because they introduce characters and themes carried forward here."
4,Not the best collection,"For Dilbert fans, this is a must buy book. However, for those that are starting out on their Dilbert trek, I would recommend reading ""Still Pumped from using the Mouse"" or ""I'm not Anti-business, I'm Anti-idiot"" before purchasing this collection. Scott Adams did most of his damage in the late 90's and has not been able to pick up any momentum. Sometimes it feels like some of the newer Dilberts are just not as funny or even recycled. However, this book still has some great laughs and storylines. For the office slave worker, Dilbert will probably never cease to be funny. If you love Dilbert, you're going to buy this book anyway, and if you're just sort of interested, you should by some of the earlier ones."
4,cool one! may not be the best in the series,"Good one, but why those marvelous episodes circulating in the e-mails are always in the 'other' books?"
1,You get what you pay for.,"I bought this after reading the one and only review on this product. Like the reviewer, I also was looking for two aspects.1. the ability to perform in low light. 2. close up capability.One the first requirement it failed miserably. Really it is joke.I have seen better image out of cameras that have been operated in the dark with only the light from the monitor. I could shine a75 watt bulb a foot from my face and still the camera could not pick it up properly.As far as the close up requirement, I would say that it can perform at about 3 inches away from the object. With lots of light. Really lots and lots. Not very happy with the purchase.Oh, another thing, the set up was not very smooth. Ater doing everything the way they have written up, I could not get the camera to work. I actally was thinking of returning it. Then Viola!! then next day, I noticed a green light shining on the camera and was able to get a picture."
4,PRETTY GOOD!,"MY 2-YEAR OLD GRANDSON LOVES TO HELP HIS MOTHER CLEAN! HE KNOWS WHAT TO DO WITH ALL OF THE ACCESSORIES! HE LOVES TO SEE THE ""DIRT"" IN THE VACUUM CLEANER MOVE. ALL OF THE PARTS ARE REALISTIC! THE ONLY DOWNSIDE OF THIS TOY IS THE TROLLY PART OF IT COMES APART WAY TOO EASILY!ALL OF MY PURCHASES FROM AMAZON HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE AND THE SERVICE AND DELIVERY OF THE ITEMS HAVE BEEN GREAT!"
2,Cleaning Trolley Set for children,"I bought this for my grandson and although he still plays with parts and loves it, it started falling apart almost immediately. It is very cute, but not at all durable. If it were a lot cheaper, it wouldn't be so bad. If something fell apart, it would be more understandable. But, for the price, was definitely disappointed."
3,Six in one hand and half a dozen in the other,"My son LOVES this toy and plays with it constantly. He is 2 years old and loves to feel like he is accomplishing helping out with the household chores. However, this toy is not durable, did not come with directions for assembly, the vacuum cleaner does not lock in the upright position and cannot be stored on the cart. It is nearly impossible for him to remove the dust buster from the vacuum cleaner w/out help, which is more of an annoyance for us than it is for him. The price is too high for this toy as it is cheaply made. The idea of this toy is great, but the execution leaves much to be desired."
1,toy vacuum,"pretty cheap! Good for my daughter to be the big girl, help out & have her own ""stuff"". Cart comes apart very easy, hard to keep vacuum in it if they want to use it alot. The other pieces are fine, it's mostly the cart"
3,Just ok,"This product has all of the components as described, but it is of poor quality. All of the parts fit together and are easily assembled, but nothing snaps together, so it all pulls apart again with little effort. Not quite the level of sturdiness I expect for a $59 toy. Also, there were no instructions included. As a result, it took us a while to figure out that you have to partially disassemble the vacuum to attach the handle. The cart itself is cute, but I feel my money would have been better spent on a Hoover Jr and individual cleaning components from the dollar store."
1,Not worth the money!,"After reading numerous reviews, I tried to superglue this cart together before it even got played with. Didn't work, the cart disassembles constantly. However, the vacuum, to my surprise really works, minimally. I guess since she enjoys the broom and dustpan so much, as well as the spray bottle and sponge, I shouldn't complain, but it costs way too much for a fall apart piece of junk that it is."
4,great toy,"We purchased this toy for our 17 month old son who loves playing with my broom and vacuum. He LOVES it. He walks around the house all day ""cleaning."" Even his older brother who is 4 1/2 loves it. The pieces are fairly durable. The actual cart sometimes comes apart, but it is easily put back together. I would recommend this to anyone whose little ones loves imitating and pushing things around."
5,Sets up for sucess!,"My 16 year old daughter has been begging me to help train her in the art of janitorial maintenance. Purchasing her this set has allowed her to train for hours without my supervision. she can now put on her application that she has experience with a industrial grade cart, can handle vacuuming stairs, moping floors, she even understand the basics of dismissive behavior when visitors attempt to ask for directions. this set has set my child up for success and i hope you have the same results!"
1,Rivers Edge playing cards,"Don't ever order anything that will be shipped from MIDWEST MARINE AND SPORTING GOODS if you want to receive your item in good condition. Our order - Rivers Edge Lures of the Past Double Deck Playing Cards in a wood box, was shipped in a mailing ENVELOPE. The mailing envelope was taped from end to end from the postal service. The box was chipped and damaged. Why would anyone ship a wooden box in a mailing envelope. We emailed Midwest Marine and stated that we would like a replacement box and they did not respond to our email.We rate them ZERO!!!Carol FreitagZephyrhills, FL"
2,Box was warped,"It was given as a gift. Person didn't want to bother to return it, but the box was totally warped. The cards were fine and it's a nice idea but whoever packed it was very careless or they're all like that and defective."
2,heavy mask,This mask is so heavy your head and neck will rebel. I don't think anyone would want to use it for a full game. It's not expensive but you'll pay for it with a stiff neck.
2,"Very bright, break easily",I bought these lights after years of using the cheap plastic malibu outdoor lights. They are very bright (using a 18watt bulb) and look very sturdy.The main problem with these lights is the stem. The stem is a 2-piece construction and the light assembly is heavy. The result is I have had several light stems snap where the 2 pieces join togeather. It seems like to much stress is placed on this point. I have gotten tired of replacing lights and am now looking for a good light with a better design.
4,"spacey, minimal, deep techno","beltram has been a guiding and originating force in the techno scene from it's inception (energy flash being one of the first techno dancefloor anthems for those oldschool enough to remember) this album finds mr. beltram working his craft on a collection of sparse, heady techno, showing off his finesse in the almost forgotten art of taking the listener on a mental ""voyage"" through the set. Although i say sparse, and minimal, it's not so much the absence of layers (indeed, there is a bit of layering here), but rather the way they come together, always just enough to fill each knob of the mixer without being ""lush"". the phrasing of the set works quite well, and the trim is outstanding in these tracks. This can be considered nothing but pure techno..."
4,raw banging techno...kiddies and ravers look somewhere else,"this is what i'd like to think of as ""pure"" techno. along with early jeff mills and robert hood's ""internal empire"" lp, this is definitely one of the best of it's style. some of the tracks are hard enough to scrape the enamel off you're teeth. repetitive as hell, but that comes with the territory. i was suprised to hear some dub-effects here and there, but mostly this focuses on acidy synths and machine like rhythyms. in fact, this is vaguely similar to the harder sides of house music and not quite as ""smooth"" sounding as most minimal, detroit styled techno."
5,Awesome,Awesome for Magic. I especially bought these for my magic deck. They fit perfect and fell very durable. Also they are amazingly slippery.
3,What you'd expect,"I really wouldn't have placed this as a toy, because it isn't a toy, it's an accessory for collectable cards, and to put it simply, it does exactly what it's supposed to, it protects the cards. They're good enough for their price but I have broken a few while shuffling them."
4,Works Well,"These card sleeves are thin and flimsy as you would expect. However, when you insert a card into them, they seem like they will last. If you are looking for a stiff sleeve, this is not for you. They fit almost perfectly with Pokemon cards, but leave a lot of space when placing a Yugioh card. Nonetheless, I would recommend these for anyone who doesn't want to spend too much money and is looking for decent card sleeves."
2,Overpriced,"I have these and a number of packs of generic brand from a local comic book store.Generic brand is 50cents. Price of this is now over $2. And I do not see a big difference between them.I do not think either of these are durable enough for you to play with daily/weekly (MTG, Pokemon, etc ...)The generic ones are perfectly fine (and thin) for archiving though. These are a bit too expensive to buy in thousands.If you are looking for sleeves for cards you touch often, try those that have one side clear, with back solid. They will last longer and are not as slippery as these."
2,Crap,These sleeves are not good quality at all they feel super cheep and are not good if you are using them for a game like YuGioh it took nearly a month for me to get them not impressed
3,MOTIVATION,"If you want to have a day with just random, crazy nonsense then this is the series for you! It had its really funny moments, but if you are looking for something romantic, action-packed, or sad; this is not the series for you. Even though there is a little one-sided romance and some sport action, but if you want something more than that look for something else. This is a series that is for the lazy day with nothing else to do."
2,Comedy is the ony thing going for it...,"I have watched ~18 episodes out of the 26 episodes available. Azumanga Daioh is only for people who are interested in its nonsense comedy. I found the jokes funny at first, but it gets old afterward; the same or similar jokes reappear across the episodes. The series is also episodic. There is practically no story (i.e. no overarching goal). I prefer a good story over having good comedy, but I did not find the comedy funny after the first 7 episodes or so; thus, I do not recommend this anime."
3,Not as good as the manga,"I'm a big fan of the Azumanga Daioh manga so I had high hopes for this show. Truth be told, I was a bit disappointed. The show had its moments, but I found that many of the jokes from the manga simply did not transfer that well from print to animation. The Azumanga Daioh anime seems to be focused on the slice-of-life aspect of the concept more than the humor. Also, many jokes are drawn out without moving on, which gets a bit annoying.Now, this is not a bad show per se, and it certainly wasn't painful to watch. It simply fails to capture much of the charm that made the manga so great."
3,"Good show, but do be careful with the DVDs.","I'm not going to say anything bad about Azumanga Daioh. I do not believe there can possibly be any factual basis for this. Watch it. Failure to do so will render you anime-illiterate, because it is brilliant.But I will say I find the way the DVDs were packaged in the case to have been, well, haphazard at best. All six discs are stacked on a single spindle with nothing in between them. I ended up just transferring them all to jewel cases. I recommend either having six jewel cases on hand or looking for an older box set. Recent re-releases of a lot of box sets have had problems with this particular kind of material minimalism. If a ""six-disc set"" comes in a box an inch thick, something funny is probably going on in there, and by funny I mean scratchy."
5,"A great story, told by a true patriot","Nothing I can write would express my gratitude and respect for J. Francis Angier and others like him. I've read a lot about the 8th Air Force and the bomber war but this book brings home the stress and horrors of war more than any others I've read. It's a terrific read, full of interesting details on subjects ranging from farming to flying to surviving as a POW, and a great description of the life and career of a truly heroic WWII combat pilot."
2,"Moderately Amusing, Moderately Offensive","This collection of stories is a jumble of humorous anecdotes, not well connected or introduced. The only unifying elements are an over-elaberate mocking of Chinese literary conventions in English and a common narrator in Kai Lung. This is as a hut made of ill placed and random sticks. Some of the sticks may be interesting, but as a whole they do not provide much shelter."
4,A nice collection,"The many songs in this collection brings back so many memories of my youth. One folk singer is absent, Harry Chapin'.....sigh There needs to be more ""real folk singers"" Pete Seeger etc."
4,excellent,"You gotta hand it to Betty Davis, wife of Miles who called her Madmosele Marby in one of his best songs.If Helen Reddy was women, Davis was dangerous women, back when a sexually free African American women was truely a threat to social finger sandwhich pickers.Davis' uncompromising funk is all bump and pelvis grind, driven by heavy bass, clavanet, and Davis' estrogin throttled voice. She does not do the ballad, she does not experiment with softer nuance. This stuff chucks viagra arrows into your concious, and stays there.Her voice has the grit--it is sometimes a littie sandpapaer in the upper register. But for what Davis accomplishes on this and other 1970s albums likeBetty DavisandNasty Gal..........well, trust me, you'll be thinking of Betty the whole time"
3,Some good parts,"""Live Air"" is made up of two shows. The first two songs are from a loft performance in 1976, and the second two songs are from a live show in 1977. There is some good stuff on this disc, particularily in the shorter songs. Unfortunately, the opener (""Eulogy For Charles Clarke"") is too abstract for me, and gets the album off on the wrong foot. I recommend this for fans of the freer style of jazz -- people coming at this disc from Henry Threadgill's more recent tautly coiled music may be disappointed."
2,Not real Tiffany,"i have used Tiffany for many years. i have the parfum, the eau de parfum and the body cream and.........this is not the same scent that i have grown to love and crave. i'm quite disapointed. The scent is quite different. the only thing that is the same is the price! :-("
3,Very Ordinary,"Wasn't impressed with the preformance. Compared to Mantovani and Stanley Black, I just found the performance very ordinary."
2,Bang! Bang! Dead Target.,"A black target makes the bullet hole hard to see. The head should have a point score and it doesn't. Other than that, it's ok."
2,Flimsy Targets,"These targets are made of very thin paper and tear easily. I store and transport the targets in a cardboard tube, but they still shred and tear even with careful use."
4,Right on target,"Bought this product for handgun practice. Works exactly as advertised. Paper is heavy enough not to flop around, hits show clearly from a distance. Will reorder when these are gone."
2,Not One of Norris' Best Efforts,"Firewalker was meant to be a combination of Romancing The Stone and Lethal Weapon, and what it is instead is a horrible mismash that wastes the talents of two fine performers - one, a great action movie star (Chuck Norris) who knows how to be charming without going the full fledged comendy route, and a great actor (Louis Gossett, Jr.)whose desire to star in a potential blockbuster may have overwhelmed his judgment.In Firewalker, Norris and Gossett play two adventurers that end up on a quest for lost treasure, and run afoul of an evil spirit who doesn't want the treasure to be taken. That's as good (or in this case, as bad) as it gets. It's not fun, or particularly excting, and while it might have seemed like a good idea to give Norris a hand at comedy, it doesn't work.Firewalker is quite missable. Both actors have made many other movies that are a lot more entertaining."
2,Another flop from Golan-Globus.,"Those execuative poroduces Golan-Globus gave us yet another flop. Firewalker has some funny moments but it is too hokey to be believable. The cave sets look really fake and laughable, not to mention the acting. Many Norris fans many disappointed with his stab at comedy, but I enjoyed it. First rent, then buy."
4,Glad I own a copy,"Yes, it is one of the goofiest pieces of, um, processed food that ever came out of Hollywood - but it's bad with such good humor! As though everyone said ""You want me to do WHAT? Well, heck - why not?"" One thing I'll insist upon - the relationships between Norris's character and Gossett's character is a dandy - and the one between Norris's character and Anderson's - Anderson's character is a Jim Peach. ""FRUITCAKE?"" shouts Anderson, after bursting into Norris's and Gossett's hotel room. ""Are the walls that thin?"" waffles Norris. ""No, your mouth is that big!"" comes her retort. And John Rhys-Davies as the adventurer who has taken over the Central-American rebel army - wonderfully crazed! Forget about the Academy, this is just plain fun."
3,transformers,"Received this product for my son for xmas and was a little disappointed with the size of the transformer. Overall, it won't make a difference with him but in the future the overall size should be included."
4,Petty good toy,"This is a pretty good toy, it is fairly poseable and made of quality plastics unlike most of the Movie Transformers toys. The transformation is fairly simple involving only about 6 steps and all parts of the toy can store on the toy, both in robot and vehicle mode.I collect transformer toys and I love Optimus Prime, so this toy was a no-brainer for me to buy. Having said that, this version of Optimus Prime only appears in the movie for about 2 minutes, and during those two minutes he is very hard to see (dark, hidden behind objects) so there is no real way to tell how movie accurate this toy is.All in all it is an interesting and well made version of Optimus Prime, but aside from the packaging it is hard to tell which character this is supposed to be."
1,Too many errors but read for the info not the recipes,"When this book first came out it had so many errors that it was recalled and reprinted and supposedly corrected. (Or so I read on a message board). I own the 2nd printing.I really like Alton Brown. I admire and respect him. I think he's a wonderful person (I've met him), a great educator, and a good cook. But this book makes me embarrassed for him. I have the version that is supposedly ""corrected"". Yet each time I make a recipe there are so many mistakes I'm scared to make another. I've made the bread recipes and each and every one has ""issues"". I have written myself a note in the book to not make any more recipes but to use the book as a reference and a learning tool. As a ""why does this happen"" book, it's great. If you make any of the recipes, proceed with caution. The Focaccia recipe on page 260 is great, if you add an extra cup of water. Eat is right out of the oven. Yum!"
2,"Next time, make sure the recipes are RIGHT","Have a first printing of this book.... and very, very mad at it. Sure, it's great, explinations are wonderful, love the layout of the book... but they must have spent so much time on all that, and overlooked the recipes. The errors in this book make me very disappointed. I write instructions for a living, and totally wrong ingredient lists and instructions are inexcusable, for any cookbook and more so for something with Alton Brown's name on it. The first recipe I tried out of this was the pizza dough, which was so filled with errors (that I learned after the fact) that it was a disaster. If you do buy this book, check out AB's website after you get it and make sure to correct everything you need to."
2,Too Many Printing Errors to be Useful,"Well, this would be a really interesting cook book if the editors and author had done their editing jobs. The mistakes make several recipes impossible to make unless you look up the corrected recipes online- some of which don't even resemble the recipe in the book. For example, the brownie recpe in the book calls for steeping the cocoa- but gives you no volume of the water (""tk"" is not a volume measure). However, when you spend some time searching the web for the corrected recipe and finally find it, there is no steeping of the cocoa at all! That's a MAJOR error- not just a typo. If you want this book, wait until it is re-edited... or buy something else."
5,Alton Brown is among the best.,I find Alton Brown's recipes to work - always. I also learn a tremendous amount about wh these recipes work and learn to think on my own about cooking. I love it.
3,Baking is an exact science,"This book is analytical, scientific, and fun! Alton Brown shares both basic and critical knowledge of food chemistry. If you want to know why and how, this book is for you."
3,very good book .but has not got any photograph of foods!,I like The good eats from TV .So i have bought his baking book.I like that book .but i think his book and every cook book should include photographs.so i give that book just 3 stars.and I ve got the first printing of this book.How could i get the correction list of second edition?
2,Disappointing at best,"I am so angry with Alton Brown for putting his name on this book!! Remember when you were young and you thought the world of your parents, they were like gods. I think of Alton Brown in a similar way to a knowledgable relative. He brings science and cooking together with a heavy sprinkle of humor, so brilliantly that he constantly inspires me to cook. I look up to him as a role model and thought he could never let me down. Until now, with this book. Sure the techniques are sound but the recipes are TERRIBLE! Where did they come from? You won't find them on episodes of Good Eats, or even the Food Network website. I found the bread and biscuit recipe to be a complete failure with far too much liquid to dry goods. What a mess. I was cursing Alton's name. How could he let me down by putting his name on this terrible failure."
2,Many errors in this book.,"I have the first edition of this book. My husband and I have both baked recipes in it, and we've slowly come to the conclusion that it is not to be trusted. There are many errors, especially in measurements, which is funny because Mr. Brown seems to be all about weighing everything, in order to get accurate measurements. I went to the website that someone mentioned on here to correct some things, but I know from personal experience that that posting does not cover all the mistakes. Also-- Mr. Brown uses a lot of buttermilk, and when he uses buttermilk, he seems to also use a lor of salt. Either that or buttermilk is naturally salty? At any rate, everything we made from this book that had buttermilk in it was too salty for our taste. I cut the salt in half on those recipes."
3,Fun read,"Perry Mason books are great ""pick up, put down"" reads, and for the most part this novel was that. Part of the mystery deals with multiple murder weapons and that seemed to get so confusing to me, the reader, that I stopped trying to understand it. Otherwise, a nice visit with fiction's greatest lawyer (apologies to Atticus Finch)."
3,It's okay...,The movie is okay. It has a few funny moments. For a couple bucks it is worth a watch. Definitely not one of Stiller's best. Look for Tropic Thunder or Flirting With Disaster instead. The quality of the picture and sound is good on this disc.
1,Really disappointing!!,This movie should have been so funny and easy to watch but it is neither of these things!! Really not even worth watching!! I do not recommend it. I was very disappointed with the ending!!
1,"Terrible, that's all that need's to be said.",This movie is not funny at all. They set it up to be a possible funny movie but never deliver. I think this is Ben Stiller's worst movie by far. What a jerk. And not even a funny jerk.
1,Weird,"My husband rented this movie because he needed a good laugh,however there was no sound at all. Tried restarting amazon on the tv,still no sound. Tried to watch again the next day and still nothing,idk what is wrong with this instant video but we had no luck watching it."
2,Just bad,"You know when a movie has a couple of out of place BAD gay jokes within the first fifteen minutes, it is going to be a boring movie. Viola."
4,Entertaining,"I haven't seen the previous version of The Heartbreak Kid (or the play on stage) so I have nothing to compare this to, but I was surprised by the terrible reviews this movie got. No, it's not brilliant -- and it's not nearly as funny as There's Something About Mary (to mention a previous Stiller film) or as touching as The Goodbye Girl (another Neil Simon play that was made into two movies).But it's an entertaining look at a man who falls in love with a woman -- while he's on his honeymoon. Malin Akerman and Michelle Monaghan provide OK support, but not much more, as the crazy bride and the girl he falls in love with, respectively (I really don't get Monaghan's appeal, but maybe that's just me.)"
1,disgusting,"I didn't buy this movie on here but thank god i got it on sale, and i didn't waste too much money. VERY disappointed. i would give it 0 stars, but i have to give it something, besides 2 thumbs DOWN"
2,"Watch only the first half--Don't buy, rent (2.5 stars)","The Farrely brothers (Dumb and Dumber) created this film and at times I laughed so hard I cried. However, half way through the movie the laughter stops and the momentum drags. I admit, I thought the first half was so funny, I broke down and bought the DVD. However, I will not sit through the second half again; it simply is a waste of time. In fact, watching the second half actually could detract from how much you enjoyed the first half. My advice, rent the movie, watch the first half, and pretend the DVD is damaged and you simply cannot watch the rest of the film. Trust me, you'll thank me for saving you 45 minutes of your life."
4,Great movie,"Very underrated movie, lots of laughs the entire movie. Jerry Stiller is great. Only drawback is uncle Tito(carlos mencia), he sucked"
5,One of our favorites,"This is one of the few movies my wife and I come back to again and again when we need a laugh. You have to like Ben Stiller, you have to accept some very crude humor, and you have to appreciate subtle nuances that enhance the comedy immensely. I'm sure it isn't for everyone, but we love it."
5,Heartbreak Kid,"Very funny movie. Saw it on cable and had to buy it. Never was a big fan of Stiller, but he did a good job with this movie.Plot is pretty simple. He has no gf/wife, finds random girl marry's her on a whim, then while on his honeymoon, meets another girl, breaks up with his wife, girl finds out he's married and leaves to marry some random guy, stiller shows up in that girls bedroom with her husband sleeping next to him, she tells him off and he leaves for mexico, 13 months later... girl shows back up in mexico to tell stiller she loves him and she divorced her husband for him, she leaves for a fam event... and he had remarried during the 13 months to Eva Longoria and then wants to divorce her...Friggen plots... Actually this movie has 2 good sex scenes in it and shows some big boobed girls [...] bobbing up and down in the water as she's in a hot tub with stillers real dad Ben.I paid a buck for it and it's def worth checking out."
3,Kitty Ring?,This movie was funny. When I saw it was by The Farelly brothers I knew what to expect. They are notorious for their outrageous and crude humor. This movie had all that and made me laugh outloud quite a few times. For what kind of movie it is... it was a good one.
2,Heartbreaking,"Don't waste your time, see the original. Too long, not funny enough (although there were a few funny scenes), kind of mean-spirited, and the usual Ben Stiller character. He needs to expand into something else beyond Zoolander.Did I already say, see the original?"
1,Disgusting,Vulgar and tasteless. This movie crosses a line when it comes to funny. I regret watching the movie.
1,"Crude, tasteless","Let me first say that I am not a prude--I enjoyed ""Meet the Fockers"", ""There's Something about Mary"" and others in that venue. However, I seee nothing of value in this movie. The sex scenes are so tasteless that they aren't the least bit amusing, much less laugh-out-loud funny. The language Jerry Stiller uses seems beneath someone of his age--you'd think, as old as he is, he'd have acquired at least a modicum of diginity. I hung in there until the finish hoping that, at least, the movie would end decently. Sorry I bothered!!! I wasted my money. I also wasted something more valuable--2 hours of my life!!!"
1,No where near Stillers best,"I hated this movie. It had such great potential. And as the other reviewers say, the ending is horrible too. Ben Stiller has such great films but this one could possibly be a career breaker. NOT a good movie at all. The character of Lila, Eddie's wife, is beyond annoying. She has this laugh that makes you want to through things at the TV...seriously. Almost didn't even finish watching. And the attendant at the resort they stayed at was not funny either. The plot line had potential like I said but falls short of achieving. If you are absolutely that curious, spend the 4 dollars and rent it."
1,bad,"Thanks to other reviewers for the warnings. I rented this on an unbox sale and used the fast forward button to skip through Jerry Stiller's foul mouth lines, and the fornication scenes. There was still too much foul language for no reason though even with editing it. What was left after the fast forwards to get rid of the worst garbage was an unsatisfying story with little comedy and a blah ending."
1,Don't Waste your time on this one!,This movie has a bunch of trashy language. Ben Stillers Dad has a real dirty sick mouth in this movie. There are a lot of bad scenes. I would not buy this movie. It is trash.
1,"An experiment that went horribly, horribly wrong.",This was hands down the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I would rather spend 2 hours getting paper cuts on the most sensitive parts of my body than to watch this movie again. The plot is non-existent. The weak attempt at humor is tasteless and just awful. The acting is like a home movie that people forgot to turn the camera off and recorded two hours of nothing. I am astounded at how bad this movie was. I mean it wasn't even cult classic bad. It made Army of Darkness seem like a modern art masterpiece. This movie is so bad that the people who made it should be prosecuted for wasting so much money on a movie and not spending it on something worthwhile like another Rambo movie. Wow.
2,Not So Good,"The fist half of Heartbreak Kid had some laughs. The second half was pure boredom. My wife and I simply didn't connect with the typical Hollywood ""marriage is horrible"" tripe, especially considering that this was a movie for couples.And that brings me to my main point: on the surface, this is a movie for couples, but the movie itself is very anti-couple friendly. There was a ton of crude humor moments that my wife and I both hated. For example, there is a scene in which a woman's hairy lower region is revealed in all its very hairy glory (no kidding), and the woman proceeds to urinate on the back of Ben Stiller. This is completely seen on film; every aspect.It was at this point that my wife checked out. I did as well, not knowing what this movies was trying to be.In the end, The Heartbreak Kid had zero chemistry and was utterly forgettable. Don't put your wife through this."
1,Don't Waste Your Time!,"This movie ""broke my heart"".....what a disappointment. Do yourself a favor and get the original with Charles Grodin,it is excellent."
2,watch it on tv,"What happened to the farrely brothers??? they probably lost their talent in cabo while filming...Anyway, to be short, i'm a huge fan of stiller, the farrely's...but this movie is only worth a watch on tv. No laugh around and certainly nothing close to there's somethiong about mary...HD DVD is of excelent quality, sound and picture are crystal clear...but that's the least they could be on such a media.Too bad"
1,Sideshow Ben - Not home for the holidays,"While the 2007 production of the Heartbreak Kid had the makings of a holiday film event, this misdirected, ingenuine script manages to bring the romantic comedy genre to a new low. Heartless and awkward, Ben Stiller is as confused about his sexual preferences here as we are with his lack of sincerity or sense of relationship. An afront to thinking men, women and children this venture finds no value in Mexican culture nor the animal world (in a graphic scene of bestiality). Unfortunately, better cast members than BS are taken down with this sticky man of war and will no doubt regret all but the great Mexican beach location. As for my family holiday movie wish list, I wish I had left this stinker on the shelf."
3,Typical Ben Stiller sad-sack movie,"Ben Stiller has made variations of this movie before, including ""Meet the Parents"" and ""Along Came Polly."" Sad sack meets girl, gets hitched, complications ensue. This one features the always-funny Jerry Stiller as the dad. The crazy wife isn't all that crazy, but there are moments. The only laugh I experienced came near the end during a sequence showing Ben being rounded up by immigration officials as he tries to re-enter the US from Mexico. Oddly, the movie seems to end at 90 mins, but then carries on another half hour. This is easy watching."
4,Really funny movie,Don't know what's up with all these people leaving so many negative one star reviews. I really enjoyed this movie.
2,An what was the point of this movie???,"There were a few laughs to be found in this movie, but they were few and far between. Gross humor!!!!!"
4,Just Eat It!,"An excellent little book with sensational illustrations. This book explores some of the foods from around the world which different cultures enjoy, but which may seem disgusting to us. Everything thing eaten is not in here but there is a good selection. What was eaten throughout history around the world is also included.My favourite section is part three - Strange Stories from your own Kitchen which explains what cows eat and how that food gets turned into the milk which we drink. There is also similar information on how bees make honey.There's also a few recipes and 19 poems as well. I am not really into poems so they didn't do much for me but if you are into poetry then this may well be a bonus for you. The illustrations in this book are sensational though, and worth the price alone."
2,Poorly constructed and overpriced.,"I am going to be lenient by giving this product two stars only because it looks decent. Functionally, however, it deserves a negative (-) 7. The case is poorly contructed, what kind of company uses a METAL internal latch, which SCRATCHED my psp. It wasn't a light scratch, it is deep enough to the point where you can feel it if you run your fingernail over the scratch. I would never buy this case again, even if it was 1 dollar. I'm returning the product and I am most likely going to lose most of my refund money from the shipping costs, but that's fine with me because this product is really horrible. I am never going to buy a Nyko product again."
4,"What a nice, easy read...","This was a very sweet book. I loved ""Bear"" and Diamond. Their relationship was believable and the setting was very interesting. It was the first book I had ever read set on the construction of a railroad. It was a quick read, and not to mention quite funny at times. I recommend it to anyone who likes sweet, lighthearted romances."
2,So-So,"This book barely held my attention. Sure, it has moments of humor and moments of sweetness, but I couldn't help but become unbearably bored after the first several chapters. Perhaps I'm becoming jaded, but the passion between these two characters seemed forced and banal."
5,It is one I recommend!!,"I'm only 13yrs old and I thought that it was excellent. Sure I thought the first couple of chapters boring but after the characters Diamond and ""Bear"" met everything turned upside down. Bear's words wouldnt come out right, he can't keep his ""hormones"" on check, and he can't keep his temper! Diamond is the same way. Only her words will come out right, she can keep her ""hormones"" under check sometimes, but it's ussually her feelings being hurt. I picked this book up because I couldn't find my ussual author, Candice Proctor, and my friends were impatient. Now all i want to do is read more of her books!!!"
3,Disappointing and boring.,"I WAS a fan of Ms. Krahn, based on her prior books. This book should have been another winner, based on the premise. Unfortunately, I was bored almost from the get-go. I felt no compassion for the characters, I didn't see any chemistry at all. If I was asked to recommend a book to read, this wouldn't be the one."
3,Not polished enough,"This is an interesting but half baked game. From a franchising side there are plenty of characters to play with. However, only a few are available at the start and the progression for unlocking characters is slow. Gameplay is a bit sluggish and lacks the depth of fighting game. There isn't much in the way storyline and the levels can be beaten by surviving long enough. Overall, this game looks and plays as if very little effort was put into anything other than having a large cast of characters."
5,this is a must for anybody who likes fighting games,i bought this game nervous about the bad reviewsbut it turns out it is one of those games you cant put downthey have great monsters and 2 new ones this is great
5,Godzilla Fans Dream Game,This is more than any Big G fan could ask for. The roster is amazing for this game 26 monsters in all. The boards and monsters all look great and the controls work pretty well. This was the reason I bought a Wii and I was not disappointed I don't see how they could top this one I definitely reccomend this to any and all Godzilla fans.
3,I think it needs improvement,"This game isn't bad but it isn't the best either. At first, it was great, then it became difficult. Later on in the game, the controls became difficult to use, the remaining unlock-able monsters became very hard to get and it took me hours to complete a certain task. The game is fun but very frustrating and time consuming at the same time. It is a big step up from the last Godzilla game :Godzilla: Save the Earthand is a lot better than theDS Edition. In All, I thinkGodzilla UnleashedforPlayStation 2is the better edition of the game."
1,what happened?,I never did get this game from you guys and after about 2 months i forgot about it. until now is there something i could do or is it to late?
5,Kid's Review,"Very Fun, This Game Is So fun that I play Whit it Day And Night. and Can You Believe this. I'm still 9 years Old and I'm not scared. But my mother Does Not Like To hear the Monster Sounds. And all my mother could say about this Game was that ; Where did the People Get these Monster sounds, but I still Love this game and there is a Realy Ugly monster Called Biolante. Its Just too much fun."
3,"Not bad, fun for awhile.","Earth is under attack by an alien force. Power crystals appear which give off radation and all of the classic monsters return and get very powerful. You begin as Godzilla and are assigned different missions all over the Earth. You can choose your own path. Will you help the aliens invade, or will you fight them off.You earn points in what ever plan you choose. These points can be used to buy additional things to help you in your quest. You can also combat one-on-one with friends. For me this was the most fun aspect of the game, as the silly story line would get old after awhile.This is an average game, made available on the WII franchise. There is nothing spectacular that sets it apart like some of the other great games that make use of the very unique system that is the WII."
3,a bit slow moving,Game has some good potential but felt too limited. Would benefit more from a more open environment.Also the controller doesn't feel as intuitive as I would like. This makes the action feel rather sluggish.
2,"Somewhat fun, but gets old quick","I lasted a total of maybe 5 hours before I had the base game beat. I then let my daughter have her fun with it, and she lost interest after not even an hour. Since then, it has been collecting dust in our library. Although it is somewhat fun for a while, this game should've been released with a 19.99 price tag."
1,Godzilla Unleashed: Not Worth the Money,"if you absolutely have to own this game, wait for it to hit the bargain bins. it looks like it should be fun, but the controls are really confusing. the levels end abruptly and there isn't a lot of incentive to unlock stuff."
2,"Looks Great, Plays Bad","'Godzilla Unleashed' is like dating a supermodel with a serious amount of baggage. She looks great on the outside but once you start peeling back layers you can see she's not all she's cracked up to be. The graphics and look of this game are great. With the graphical ability of today's games you can make a game that is very eye appealing and not spend any time on the gameplay or AI of the game itself. This is exactly what is going on here. The writing is poor, the premise is boring, but having said all that it's great to look at. If you are looking for a fun game with great gameplay this isn't it. If you love monster premise games and are more concerned with the look you will probably be happy but don't say you weren't warned.** NOT RECOMMENDED"
3,great game but....,The controls for the wii stink. The monsters are awesome and the game itself is amazing but the controls are so awful that it ruined the game for me. If you can get use to the controls then its a great game.
1,"Not charts, but just outlines","The whole purpose of buying a book like this is to convert the information into a visual format, such as into chart form. Nevertheless, you can see from the samples that much of this book consists of ordinary outlines, not of charts at all. The author's ""Charts of the New Testament"" on the other hand, is quite good, and is almost entirely composed of charts in visual form, such as one would use on an overhead projector, to help the students to visualize the material taught.Let us remember that Zondervan is in this business to sell books, more than to help readers learn. Just as the ""Dummies"" series is nothing more than a marketing strategy for a series of how-to books written by unrelated authors who pay the fee to use the name, likewise not all these Zondervan books of the ""Charts"" series are created by the same authors or for the same noble purpose, but mainly to identify themselves with the successful series, and to sell. Be careful before you buy."
1,"Research, research, research","I haven't read this book in its entirety but have noticed that it is quoted on a website about cults and used as an authority. On reading excerpts about Jehovah's Witnesses, I wonder if Dr. House didn't really do the research needed to form his opinions. The opinion that Jehovah's Witnesses are not allowed to read or study any bible but their own is not true. Having been around JWs my whole life, I know that many have several translations of the bible on their book shelves. Without having his book right in front of me, I can't pick it apart bit by bit, but this is a pretty basic mistake and makes me wonder if he's formed his opinions independently and through his own personal research and interviews with real members of these cults/sects or relied on others misinformation."
1,This textbook is TERRIBLE!,"This book is written in unnecessarily complicated language and does not present information in a way that is easily understood. I teach graduate courses in quantitative methods and I made the mistake of ordering this book for one of my courses without reading it first. It was a disaster!Unless you are getting a doctorate and need to know lots of complicated formulas without adequate explanations, DO NOT buy this book."
3,Quant Methods Book,"I have used this textbook for an upper level math class and although the book was hard to follow, I really feel that it did present the information in a well laid out format. Some of the words were hard to grasp, but as for the problems in the back, I found them very useful. I hope anyone out there will in fact give this book a chance."
3,Oxycise level 2,Seems to be ok but too many postion and it a bit confusing. I'v doon Greer's beathing and like it better
3,Excellent to get your body breathing,"I can't say I have lost inches and inches; I have only been at it for two weeks. I can say that I feel great after finishing a set, I have worked up a sweat and my energy levels have increased significantly. I believe that with consistency, more exercise (in addition to this) and a very healthy diet, there will definitely be results. I do like that you are encouraged to this while pregnant as well. I think that is very important. I would recommend this."
1,"Horrible films, unless you're looking for an example of shoddy scholarship","The films in this series are poorly made, unresearched, propaganda films. The information which they present is inaccurate and sometimes downright hateful. There are far more accurate religious films out there."
2,Design error,I have a similar experience with the same fixture but different finish. What actually seems to happen is that the water trickles through the wire connection in the top and drips on the bulb. I have four fixtures and I'm usually replacing a bulb every couple weeks.
2,Disappointed,"I've had a set of these for about four years and have had similar experiences with bulbs burning out due to water infiltration. I even tried sealing the small openings with silicone sealant and that didn't help. I've also had problems with the upright ""post"" section becoming loose because the threads on the in-ground part deteriorated. I'm going to pull these lights up and see if I can get the manufacturer to replace them with another style or give me a refund. The only reason I didn't give them 1 star is because they are very attractive and the finish has held up very well."
1,Poor Product,I bought 2 of these lights last weekend and when i tryed to use them the first evening out neither one of them would work correctly when i got a bite on one just the sound came on whichis not very loud so we didnt hear it and the other one didnt work at all. I was very disappointed in this product. It is a very poorly manufactured product Dont waste your money on it spend a couple dollars more and get one that works
1,Get a flea collar instead!,"I have a Bichon Frise and after 24 hours of applying the treatment, he developed an uncontrollable and unstoppable scratching frenzy. After one more day of watching the poor fellow suffer to the brink of insanity (he was starting to cry with frustration), I realized that matters were definitely not improving - as recommended by a veterinary website, I bathed him using dish detergent which stripped the medication from his skin. Thankfully, his scratching frenzy subsided quite soon after. Amazon were great, by the way, and gave me a full refund on the product after sending it back to them. It's not usually their policy to refund on a product, but I guess they have had a lot of complaints!I then decided to buy him a flea collar instead which has been very effective with no reactions and is MUCH cheaper (it costs $5 and last 6 months!). In conclusion, I would recommend trying a flea collar FIRST before going to the hassle and expense of Advantix."
1,Bad Skin Reaction,I applied this medicine to my lab mix dog and it was terrible. Within an hour she was panting very heavily. Then the next day we noticed that he back was so sensitive that she wouldn't even let us pet her. We washed her and tried to get as much of it off as possible but so far she is still too sensitive to pet. Please be careful when buying this product. After this happened to my dog I've been doing some research and bad reactions to this product are common.
1,Be VERY careful using this product!!!!!,"I purchased this product (K9 Advantix 21-55 lbs.) on the advice of my vet. Since it was vet recommended I didn't take the time to read reviews. That mistake led to many days of suffering for my dog...horrible itching, panting, erratic & frantic behavior, biting himself & us, hives on his legs & irregular breathing (in the short periods of time he was able to sleep). MY COMPLAINT IS WITH THE MANUFACTURER OF THIS PRODUCT for not listing the potential side effects. Although, stupidly on my part, the ""HAZARDOUS TO DOMESTIC ANIMALS"" warning on a product I was about to use on my DOG should have clued me in. We'll take our chances with the fleas."
1,danger,"My 2 tear old dog is in the 24/7 emergency hospital for the past 2 weeks with anemia and an autoimmune problem... only thing that was different was that we applied k9 advantix. Her red blood cell count dropped to as low as 8 ( normal range is 35 - 50 ) and she has had 2 blood transfusions. there is another dog in the same hospital with the same thing and in talking with the owner the only thing that was differnt was a flea treatment. Please be careful with these chenicals as they are dangerous. Thousands of dollars later her blood count is slowly rising.... but she is on 2 steroids and 3 stomach meds as steroids are very bad on the stomach... Do not use K9 advantix... if you do and you see any adverse reaction give the dog a bath immediately, Donot use k9 advantix Buy A flea comb... any chemical applied to your pet can cause side effects...Ths time it could be deadly... Still praying that she keeps improving and doesn't relapse.I will be contacting BAyer and the EPA in regards to this...."
1,Dangerous Side Effects,My Shih tzu almost died after using this product. Before you put this on your pet do some research. You will find that many many dogs have had serious allergic side effects from this product and many have died. We still do not know if my Shih tzu is going to live or not. PLEASE DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE YOU BUY THIS PRODUCT
5,Great Product - Fast Delivery,The product was received fairly quickly and it is exactly what I ordered. Will order it again from the same vendor.
3,Flea bite,Application is easy. This product is obviously for the occasional bug. If the dog goes frequently to an infested area then this is not an appropriate product unless you are willing to subject your pet to repeated assaults from the bugs. At some point the bugs will reduce in number to zero. When I say bugs I mean fleas. Have had not had tick problem at all so I don't know the true value of that feature of that application.
4,Very pleased,"I was very pleased with the quality and shipment of this product. It shipped and was received very quickly and was exactly what I ordered. Great product, great service!"
2,ineffective,"I applied this product to all three of my dogs, which are all under 10 pounds, and it is not working. It has not quite been a month and they are still scratching with fleas. I will not purchase this product again. It is too expensive and does not work effectively!!!"
4,Flea and tick control,We use this product in addition to a collar as we live in wooded area with many deer and other animals that carry ticks. Works well for our lab who loves the outdoors and water.
2,Just ok....,I had to apply this stuff once every 2-3 weeks. I didn't think it was all that great. I will be buying a different brand next time.
1,Horrible,"This product is trash. It seems to make my dog's condition worsen after I apply it. I told myself maybe I applied it wrong, but four times in row, shame on me for putting my dog through this misery. I will never use this product again. The price way outperforms the product."
2,"It's okay, just like the others...","This works okay but it does not get completely rid of the fleas. Our yard is treated, as well as all 3 of our dogs and they still have fleas. Not near as bad if not treated but they still have fleas."
1,WORTHLESS FLEA TREATMENT,"This product is worthless against fleas. I used this flea treatment exactly as the directions stated and got zero results. My dog has as many fleas now as she did before. If you spend one penny for K9 Advantix you will have spent too much. Waste of money! Whats really bad about the whole situation is I'll have to wait 30 days before I can put any other medicine on my poor dog. DON'T BUY,DON'T BUY."
5,Flea control,I have used this products over the last three years and am pleased with the results of keeping fleas and ticks off my dog.
1,Doesn't work well,"I have used K9 Advantix monthly on my dog since she was old enough. She has had flee bites and I have pulled numerous ticks off of her (already feeding). I have to take her into the vet tomorrow because she has bull's-eye marks on her (possibly Lyme Disease). Maybe it could be worse if she was not on anything, but it defiantly doesn't work as advertised."
1,Company sent wrong product,I ordered this product but received advantix for dogs over 55 pounds. Thank goodness I noticed before using on my 5 pound chihuahua. I sent an email to the company 3 weeks ago through amazon and still haven't heard back!
4,CocoJax,The product performed well and did not have any major sidefects. Another brand caused my pet to itch when applied.
1,Stay away!!!,"Two hours after using this product on our sweet little bichon he started screaming. His skin turned bright red and was swollen. We washed him, but the next day he continued to shriek every time he moved. Two days later his back was covered with thick scabs. He was burned. A few days later his front legs broke out in scabs, like it was burning him from the inside. Weeks later we are still seeing new scabs on his front legs. The Advantix helpline vet told me that next time I should put it in several different spots instead of all on one spot! As if I was going to use it again!!!! Stay away!!!"
1,Didn't work for me.,"I bought this and used as directed. My dog is covered in fleas. I tried it an additional month just to see if it would work, and no luck. I've been using K9 Advantix for years and never had a problem until I tried this less expensive way. I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Very good price,This was the best price I have found for the Advantix. It has always worked great for us on our Golden Retriever.Ordering from Amazon is always quick and easy.
2,Does not work well,Put this on both my dogs. And they are scratching 2 weeks later. And still have fleas. Do not buy this product.
1,Toxic,"I have three different dogs - a shi tzu, lhasa apso, and jindo. All are experiencing diarrhea, twitching, and lethargy. Worse decision ever to switch to Advantix."
2,Doesn't work,"I received the product quickly. However, with fleas being so bad this year, I found this product did not work. I found another product worked better, that I bought from a local pet store. I removed carpets from my home, and sprayed the yard. Still Advantix did not do the job. The service was great, but the product didn't perform."
4,K9 Advantix Application,"The product is good, works very well on my dogregarding fleas and ticks. I still wonder if its really works for mosquitoes and flies bites."
3,Helpful but not perfect,The advantix for dogs 21-50 lbs worked fast removing most fleas. But a week or so later there still were some fleas still annoying my dog.
5,Best product on market for this!,"I love K9 Advantix because it not only protects my kids from fleas and ticks, but also from mosquitos, which is very important!"
3,It's Flea control,"So the item got to me, but it took a very long time, I think it was lost in the mail. but it's flea control for my dog, it got here and all is well."
1,Advantix Fatality,"Please if you love your pet, do not use this product. My beloved 15 year old yellow lab Barney died from liver failure after the administration of this product. There is a formal investigation being conducted by the EPA NPIC (National Pesticide Information Center)1-800-858-7378 and a class action lawsuit by Positive Legal Group in California. The investigation is for all manufacturers of all spot-on treatments. Please be very cautious if using any spot on treatment."
1,dangerous pet med!,"30 pound dog Advantix applied according to directions. She became tachycardic, and experenced lethargy, vomiting, rapid breathing, frantic scratching and biting her legs. I though we were going to lose her. Finally in desperation gave her a vigorous bath and within just a few hours breathing and heartbeat returned to normal. Still lethargic, but somewhat better. This is a horrible drug that does not come with enough cautions."
2,Bad Batch,i have used this product before and has worked great. however this batch isn't quite up to par. it repels fleas(but not much problem with them in winter anyway) but has not been effective against ticks. hopefully second dose will work better.
3,I'll stick to Frontline,"It works, just not too well with other dogs around that aren't treated. I get better coverage for my buck with cheapo Hartz brand stuff. So far Frontline has been the best product I've tried. Lasts long and works with other flea bags around. But every dog is different."
2,WORKS LITTLE,"FOR THE MONEY, YOU ARE BETTER OFF GOING TO WALMART AND BUYING 2 PACKS OF PET ARMOUR, WHICH IS, GENERIC FRONTLINE PLUS AND WORKS BETTER- KILLS EGGS AND HAS BIRTH CONTROL FOR PEST BUILT IN!! SO DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
3,advantage,"cheaper than at the pet store, but you only get 4 months worth instead of six., so its not really cheaper. Probably will not order this from Amazon."
1,Neuro side effects,"Tried this product on recommendation from my vet...my dog a cockapoo-wheaton mix 30lbs, had a severe neuro reaction!!!! Similar to a seizure, disorientated, unable to ambulate, within 12 hours of application"
3,was given wrong order!,I ordered Advantix and was sent Advantage. Now i'm forced to go to a vet store and buy the right stuff because my dogs are overdue. Won't purchase this again through Amazon.
4,Flea control,"Seems to work. At the height of flea season, the dogs (2) scratch occasionally. But they are flea magnets and it seems sporadic. I suspect they are picking up occasional fleas, but they don't last long. I haven't seen signs of a real infestation. I'll keep using Advantix."
1,Very Dissatisfied,"I have a Shiba Inu and previously I had been using Frontline with no problems. I put the K9 Advantix on him on a tuesday and when I came home from class thursday he was freaking out hiding in my closet (he has never been in my closet before). He was panting heavily and didn't want me to touch him whatsoever. Anytime I made him get out of the closet I noticed he kept trying to bite something on his back.. I'd imagine this was his skin becoming very irritated. I had no idea what was wrong with him until I realized the only thing I changed was his flea medication. The effects wore off by the 3rd day, but I was afraid for his life. I tried calling the number on the box.. I left my name and number, but no one returned my call. I will never use anything by them again."
1,"Yea, It's Works, but at What Cost to the Health of Your Pet?","I have used this product on three different dogs now (all under 20 lbs) and two have had extreme reactions. At this very moment, my poor dog Henry is absolutely suffering. After an application 2 days ago, he cannot stop pacing, panting, panicking, crying. He cannot even stay still long enough to take a drink of water, eat or sleep. Of course, the vet says it is just a coincidence, that it can't be the Advantix. They have to say that.. they sell the stuff! Please read other user reviews and blogs online very carefully before applying this to your dog! I regret that I did not."
1,SIDE EFFECTS,"I can't tell you if this product works or not because my dog is having a bad reaction after only applying it. They don't mention anything about side effects, yet, I've found many stories on the internet of bad reactions. My 4 year old pug hasn't been the same since I applied it. Shes not being herself, shes walking weird and she keeps scratching her back. I will never use this product again."
5,Flea and Tick Control,"Actually, what I find interesting is that the negative, 1 star, ratings. Seven (7) of them are by the same person (Rick), Three (3) of them are by (D.Defenbaugh). Doesn't Amazon employ individuals with a little common sense. Can they not read? The negative responses are all the same. HEllO!!! I have been using this product for two (2) years and both of my dogs do not have any fleas or ticks. So I gave this product five (5) stars."
1,K9 Advantix is too dangerous to use!!!!!!!,"My dog almost died from using K9 Advantix. I used it on her in January & within 24 hours she started vomiting for 3 days straight. She was disoriented & could barely stand. Although I washed my hands after applying the product, I became nauseated after petting her & also vomited. Thinking it was a coincidence that we both were sick at the same time & not realizing the toxicity of K9 Advantix because those side effects are not listed on the package, I used it on her again last week (mid-March) and we both developed nausea again. This time my dog threw up for 4 days with blood. Because the exact same thing happened within 24 hours of using this product on 2 separate occasions, I was able to make the connection. Then I searched the internet & found hundreds of dog owners complaining of the same problem. Bayer needs to remove this product from the market!!!!!! Shame on them."
1,did not work at all,this product did not work at all.i have used this before and it was fine.this time NOT!i just heard on tv some meds ordered onlineare fakes.that must have been what happened to me.dzK9 Advantix Flea Control for Dogs 21-55 Pounds (6 Applications)
1,Not effective for ticks,"I switched from Revolution to Advantix for the tick control. Bottom line, this product does not work as advertised.I took my dog (treated with Advantix - advertised tick protection), and my mom's dog (control - no tick protection) into the hills for a hike. Both dogs were kept mostly on the trail, both dogs did brush against the grass. After the hike, my mom's dog with no tick repellent picked up 7 ticks. My dog, 4 days after Advantix application (no baths), picked up a dozen ticks. Not only did we pull 12 ticks off him within 48 hours of the hike, none of them appeared to be dying. The advantix may work a little... both my husband and I found ticks crawling toward our heads after sitting on the couch with the dog. The ticks don't die and still attach, but watch out... they may look for a tastier meal at home - YOU!"
1,"Well... I wish I could tell you, but I don't know!","Since I never actually received ADVANTIX, I couldn't tell you. I ORDERED Advantix, but the seller sent me Advantage II instead. Being that I was desperate, I went ahead and tried it. What I CAN tell you is that Advantage II is about as worthless as the drug store brands.I believe I'm just about through with Amazon buying."
4,Works for both of my dogs,"I have used this product on both of my dogs (approximately 40-60 pounds)for a number of years with no major side effects. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars, is that my dogs don't really like the smell. It really helps with the ticks. We live in a wooded area, and without this product, my dogs would be covered in them."
1,K9 Advantix,So far I have put this product on my dog twice and she still has a problem with fleas. not satisfied with the product.thanks
5,K9 Advantix Flea and tick control,"I use the product mostly to prevent ticks from getting on my dogs. Advantix works really well. Once applied Advantix is totally effective within two days. Even during this first day or so tick might get on the dog, but will not break the skin to feed. After a few days the ticks will not even get on the dog. I check my dogs after every walk and do not find any tick or fleas. I find the application lasts more than a month. This is a very effective product, also does not irritate my dogs skin like some other product I have used. I would recommend this product to a friend."
5,Great control!,Bought this for my sister who has a dog that was basically infested with fleas and after a few treatments she is good as new. Highly recommended from own experience.
4,K9 advantix red 21-55lbs,This product works great...knocked back the fleas for over 3 1/2 weeks. Saw it begining to lose potency after this time but the loss of a couple of days does not take away from the great value of this product.
5,K9,arrived in time and in good shape. thanks.arrived in time and in good shape. thanks.arrived in time and in good shape. thanks. great product
