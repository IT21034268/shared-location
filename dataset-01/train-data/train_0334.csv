2,A little too dark,"The last Eminem CD was quite a bit lighter and was a lot of fun. This is much, much darker. There is a lot of murders, beatings, rapes and the such in this CD. Eminem went from party rap to gangsta rap. I don't care for this CD nearly as much as the first one. ..."
2,Nothing Compared to SSLP.....,"When i bought this album i was expecting better, much better, i think this album is much worse then ""the slim shady lp"", and i wish it had been better so i wouldn't have had to waste my [money]..... theres only 2 or 3 good songs on the album, which are ""criminal"", ""stan"" which is getting annoying after a while, and ""drug ballad"", slim's new single ""the way i am"" is scary and makes me want to throw the album in the trash even more then the first single ""the real slim shady""....... truthfully i cant wait for Slim's next effort because i think hes a good writer but he put his abililty to waste on this one..... hoping for the same record sales but better results next time...."
2,"Good Album, 2.5 stars, not classic, don't get confused","This is a good album compared to the Nellys and P. Diddys of the rap game but even I could outrap them, this is nowhere a hip-hop classic that some of you said, you're disrespecting the true pioneers of hip-hop when you say that, Em disses pop stars but he's a pop star and nothin' more than that, if you're lookin' for one buy Eric B. and Rakim's ""Paid In Full"", Run-Dmc's ""Raising Hell"", Nas ""Illmatic"", LL Cool J's ""Mama Said Knock You Out"", or Slick Rick ""The Great Adventures Of Slick Rick"" instead of this one, even Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince's ""He's The DJ, I'm The Rapper"", that's right Will's even a better mc than Eminem too, show some respect punks, but if you're looking for a good pop rap album buy this one, don't buy his other ones 'cause they all suck, this is his only good one, I think he's only famous 'cause he's white, if he were black he would be just an average rapper."
4,Eminem pulls it off again,"Normally I don't like rap music but I can't imagine it without him. Being one of the few white rappers out there, he's proved that he can run with the big dogs and this cd proves it. Not only are his lyrics clever, but they're funny as well. If you heard ""Real Slim Shady"" on the radio than you know what your in for. The only downside to this cd is the song ""Kim"". I don't know why he put it on there put it is the so unecessary. I would never rap about killing my wife. Other than that an excellent cd. Buy it. Now."
4,"Great, but the first one was better...","Eminem has words that ring true. However, this album is missing a slight something that the Slim Shady LP had... But, it's nothing detrimental, nor does it give any reason to slam this album."
1,This CD is overrated live with it.,"The Marshall mathers lp has got to be the most overrated album in the history of hip-hop and music, to say that this is better than classics like It takes a nation to hold us back, Ready to die, Illmatic, must be on some kind of acid trip, I Thought every single song was useless, eminem claims he's anti-pop, yet he has the same fanbase as the backstreet boys & NSync, the real silm shady was a ridiculous song and everything else is just silly. (with the exception of stan)This rapper paved the way for so-called hardcore rappers aka Poseurs like 50 who's making rap look bad then ever.and 50 didn't get shot 9 times, that was just a gimmick, he got shot 3 times.If you want a real good album of 2000's based on a white rapper look no futher than Bubba Sparxxx's deliverence.Eminem is not for me, only for pathetic useless stans who only thinks this is a good album.This album is the most overrated album of all time live with it."
1,WTF?,This isn't what its hyped up to be.. just like fem himself. A 4 year old bad mouthed kid could do better than this. 1 star is too much.
4,Great album!,"EMINEM rule, sure... This album shows that he really rule... You can listen to hits like Stan, the real slim shady and the way i am... but it's much more than that... eminem saz what u always wanted to say but you couldn't, cuz you would probably be fired... listen to it and then, aw..."
3,"Uhhhhh, I dunno","Ok, this cd is so weak compared to Slim Shady. Its got some strong points like Marshall Mathers, Drug Ballad,Under the Influence and B____ Please 2. But the rest are weak. Like oh my god, why the hell would you make Stan a single? That isn't rap, its crap! Along with the real slim shady, I'm Back, The Way I am, Kim, and every other one on the album, [...] Slim SHady came out before he was a TRL icon, before he went Hollywood, so that was good stuff. And if you can find it, pick up his 96 debut ""Infinite"". That is rap in its purest form. With positive and upbuilding lyrics, before he had any Slim Shady in him. He gets 3 stars because of the 4 good songs. I hope on his next solo he won't make the same mistakes."
5,This cd is even better then the jerkey boys,wow I just got this cd on friday I loved it so much I listend to it 6 times my favroite song is Kim all the bad words and stuff are so cool and he made this record better then the slim shady LP so for all you rap fans out there buy this cd
3,Not a bad album but often scandaluous for its own sake.,"Eminem is a brilliant lyricist. No doubt for those who heard him on the wonderful Soundbombing 2. However, this album continues the path he set on the song ""Dead Wrong"" with obsessive lyrics. It's rather fascinating to examine the twisted mind of a downtrodden figure but often at the expense of its profundity. For example, the skit Ken Kaniff is supposedly a wonderful satire but I think that it was too disgusting to mention. Eninem should try to become a little more mature in his subject matter but he ought to retain his wonderful talents. Of course, the pictures in this album are just better than the first album. The production is okay but I think that instrumentation of the sampling is much better than the first and I really think he deserves lots of props for his unique voice in hip-hop."
5,"Great Debut Single, EXCELLENT CD!","First off, I have been a die-hard country music fan for 18 years.After hearing ""The Real Slim Shady"" a few weeks ago, I had to find out who put it out. May 26th I bought the CD. I love it. I love all the songs. I really, really am surprised at what I found. I expected a rap CD about killing everyone. I got that, but Eminem backs up his argument very well. He lets his audience know that he is just a music artist, and that everyone needs to loosen up sometimes.His best songs are ""Stan,"" ""Kill You,"" and ""Marshall Mathers."" ""Stan"" stands out of the CD the most. It is a song about a crazed fan. His songs are very well-written and I hope he gets a Grammy. ...After Garth Brooks, George Strait, and Brooks and Dunn, I have grown tired of country music. Eminem is a great switch, as far as I'm concerned.wilsonaw@email.uc.edu"
4,HITTIN THE LYRIC,"EMINEM is back with a HOT album that is just one cut below his debut joint which was almost perfect. from the 1st track, kill you, to the last, criminal, this cd has some tight lyrics and great chorus'. eminem sticks to his style which most artists dont and is more edgy and cunning in this album. he gets his message across and doesnt care what people think. this is a must have for any rap lover."
5,This CD rocks the household!!!!!,"This cd is so funky!! I know some of you out there don't like Real slim shady so i'll keep this short. The song is so funky!!! I love it and I love The way i am. like, e-mail me if you want. From,"
4,i liked it alot...but not a classic,yea....eminem is pop but he still can make a nice song.i enjoyed it a lot.the only complaint is he didnt rhyme as good as he did on the slim shady lp and wasnt as funny.but still rhymed crazy!id reccomend to anyone.
4,he IS the real slim shady,"Eminem's new album the Marshall Mathers LP might be more intense than his last album the Slim Shady LP, but he still speaks the truth. On this album, he disses out artists like Christina Aguilera, Insane Clown Posse, Puff Daddy, Will Smith, Britney Spears, and all those bubblegum boy bands, putting them in their place. The most spine-tingling track on the album is KIM, with his violent screams and antics that make you listen to him like you ain't never heard him before. If you liked his first album, you absolutely must get this one. He definately is the real slim shady, and there's a little in all of us."
5,"Awesome, Pure Awesome.","This is, In my choice, Slim's best album, If you're a fan, You must buy, When I bought this album, I listened to it, I'd say everyday for about a year, And, Well, I still listen to it, To this day, One of my all time favorite's..So yes, Should you buy?Yes, You should, You will love it, Maybe as much as I did. =D"
5,Best CD of the year,"Eminem is unbelievable. His skill with words, his anger and his passion are all revealed in this album. I loved the Slim Shady LP, but this CD is out of this world.The amazing thing about this album is Eminem's ability to let us into his world. The album covers the emotional spectrum. The heart renching cut ""Stan"" shows Eminem's sympathetic side while the track ""the way I am"" demonstrates his anger.I hope that Eminem continues to make records, because this CD restored my faith in rap."
5,Kim Me Anyday,"My god ! I thought I was going to be dissappointed with this cd because I thought it wouldn't live up to the first one but I was wrong! It was da BEST cd ever . My favorite songs would have to be Kim , Stan , and Marshal Mathers . He is who he is , and people look down on him because he says it how it is . I think he's got more nerve then anyone in the music industry right now . He's da bomb !"
5,no sophomore jinx,With this album Eminem is on top of the world. Dre and Mel-Man take care of the producin and beats. It is a winning combination. If you don't have this album get it A.S.A.P.
5,The decade's best (so far),"Eminem's sophomore album dropped like a hydrogen bomb on the world in 2000: I remember back in the day when everything was about Eminem, endless conversations started about his lyrical prowess, his ""hate crimes"", whether he was serious about his gay-bashing, his personal problems. The album may not be perfect, some of the songs are lame and tired gangsta retreats, but when Em is on, he is On. His rhyme skills are almost unparalleled in the field of commercial hip-hop, and he has proved since this album that he is more than a one-trick pony. Rhymes such as those in ""Stan"" ""Who Knew"" ""The Way I Am"" and ""Marshall Mathers"" are simply brilliant. It is a tumultous record and it's hard to keep your ears away from it. Love him or hate him, you must have this album."
4,eminem,"looks like he likes to sing! He sings about life and like cool stuff like that!!!!! why is the typing so far a part? by, tim nelson."
5,m&m has done it again !,"At first i thougth he was going to be a 1 hit wonder. But he has alot to say, makes me wonder if his childhood was rougth. The only thing is the man can't his messages or lyrics without a curse after each word, maybe it's a way of stunning the young masses into buying his cd's. But, for the first time i saw editted cd's, so now i can get my 12 year old bro his cd's without my moms worrieing if the cd is to much for him. Thanks amazon!"
2,Who wants to listen to this crap?,"This is one of the worst albums I have ever heard. The CD starts with the violent song ""kill you"" were Eminem talks about raping his mom. Then ""Stan"" a story about a fan who kills himself becuase Em won't wright him a letter. Then song 12 ""ken kenith"" it's basicly a three man orgy (witch made me feel sick). Song 16 the prequil to ""97' bonie and clyde"",""kim"" is about Em killing his wife (kimberly mathers). Criminal is just a use of profanity for no reason. I don't recomend this to anyone."
4,Great product,"The material of the album is amazing. The CDs themselves didn't have scratches and play perfectly, the only problem I had was the way the case was treated. There was a sratch/break in the case, even though it was brand new though. Ordered one day shipping and they met my expectations with that as well."
3,"this is one nasty, sick MFer!!!!",the marshall mathers LP has good beats but the lyrics are twisted as with the Slim Shady LP. Eminem does just want the attention(negative or not)it sells albums. Glad i bought this used for little $$.
4,Pretty Good,"Eminems desire to become a serious member in the rap game has come through as he shows all sides to his ability. This is a full album with various styles and flows that show a full array of head noddin. But, when will real hip-hop come back! No gimmicks, no controversy just pure lyrics and beats."
4,Nothin' but attitude,"Eminem really sounds angry in this cd. I warn you, if you get offended easily, this cd is NOT for you. Basically, this cd trashes homosexuals, talks about how Eminem doesn't give a care about anything, and disses ""pop"" groups. ""Kim"" is nothing but a screaming fit given by Eminem. ""Slim Shady"" is a good witty song. The rhymes and the beats is the reason I gave this a 4 star rating. Another thing to look out for is the cuss words. I would recommend this cd, but if you get offended easily, please don't buy it."
3,NOT AS I EXPECTED,"When I got this cd, i expected it to be as good as other peeps say. But, when I listened to it, I had a hard time getting through some very disturbing tracks. The track that was most disturbing was the one about his wife. I just feel that that isn't right at all. Despite that, all the other songs were ok. One of the songs that I wasn't expecting was Stan. It didn't seem like Eminem would have that kind of song. Other than this, I would only recommend you to buy this album if you are a hardcore Eminem fan. If not, you should get something like Cypress Hill or somethin like that."
5,Eminem's Best Album,"This is definitely Em's best album. This was probably when he was at the peak of his career. Even for how long ago this came out, if you listen to it now, it still is good. This is when he really cared about rapping, if you were going to get any Em album, get MMLP. Even though Em fell off BADLY, he is still a Top 25 MC based on skills alone, dude is a better rapper than half of the people out now. His multis are crazy when he rhymes, but you have to hear it for yourself."
3,"Eminem, SlimShady or Marshal Mathers? Who the hell made this","I dont usually listen to rap. Ive tried. Ive listened to DMX, Cypress hill and many many others. Just doesnt do anything for me. Im more into punk grunge and rock. When I first heard of Eminem I thought ""oh gee another Vanilla Ice."" I was wrong. His first cd was full of dark humor, But it commits the ultimate sin by making fun of Kurt Cobains death. This cd is darker than ever, but keeps its special brand of humor throughout. Be warned ""The real Slim Shady"" doesnt really fit into the rest of the album. The best song is the dark, poignant ""Stan"" in which we see the mental breakdown of an overly obsessed fan through increasingly disturbing letters. If you like rap, or even if you dont, and arent easily offended give it a try. It might do more for you than me."
5,The Marshall Mathers LP ~ Review,"In short, this CD is great. Fantastic. Eminem has matured as an artist and you can see it in his music. The way that he shares his thoughts with the world may be somewhat vulgar, it was better than my expectatins. I love it. You should try listening to Stan, I'm Back, Marshall Mathers, Kim, Under the Influence, or The Real Slim Shady, which has been on the radio. The Real Slim Shady is one of a kind though, and it is the only song like it on the CD."
5,This cd is tight,Slim's lyrics are hot. Hes not afraid to say whats on his mind and his beats are pretty phat. I definitely recomend this to anybody.
5,A fan,"I have been wanting to but this cd like forever, i heard it when it was new but never had the money for it. Well found it for a good price and it came in pristeen condition."
4,Great rap cd but...,"This Rap cd is by far very amazing material by the artist and rapper Eminem but I had an issue with three tracks off this cd of his. Those tracks were 9, 12, and 14. Rememeber me was track 9, Ken Kaniff was track 12, and Amityville was track 14. But as for myself my favorite songs were The way I am track 7, Track 18 Criminal, and track 11 Marshall Mathers. This cd got a lot of heat when it came out from lot of religious groups and political groups and so forth. Just like his first album I believe this surpass the first one both in style and lyrics. But if your a true fan of his material both in style and lryics then pick this cd up if you dont have it by now and listen to it with open mind and be prepare to be amazed by the album."
3,Good Album,"Being an owner of the explicit Marshall Mathers LP, I can say that it is way better! I am reviewing this album for one song, which is the Kids. I find this song hilarious, and one of Eminem's catchiest and greatest songs. The kids that do vocals in the background are funny, and they sound like the kids from South Park. The song is great! Oh, and by the way, if you can, get the unedited LP. It's better and ""Kim"" is a great song. Its not on the album because it is too explicit."
5,Marshall Mathers LP,"This is definitly the best thing to get for your money! This CD is sooooooo awsome, it shows what a great rapper Eminem is to really be able to express everything going on in this life (good & bad) on paper! Every single song on this track has a catchy beat and although some of his rhymes are a bit chilling you will get addicted and want more,more,more! That was how it was for me. The first time I heard ""kill you"" (the second track) I couldn't believe my ears! But then a day later it became my favoraite song! That's how Eminem is: the first time you hear him you are in total shock, but after a while you grow to love him!!!!!!"
5,Eminem is still Da ...,After Eminems Debut Album The Slim Shady LP it was hard to tell if he could keep it up and he did. I like this album because of the personal being. This really brought out Eminem. My favorite tracks are Under the Influence( I can really relate to that ) and Drug Ballard. These i consider great out of just good. All the tracks are good but these two grabbed my attention the most. Under the Influence just boosted me up. I would love to tell someone that. Its great to get trashed and high to and so is Drug Ballard. I would reccomend this to any gangsta rap fan. This is a gotta get. so go out buy it!
3,This Guy is Sick,"I do enjoy this CD to a certain extent. The Real Slim Shady is a really good song, PSA 2000 is freally funny and I enjoyed Paul (skit). But when it comes to songs like Kim and Stan I don't even know what to say, those songs are just sad, I don't appreciate the song Kim at all, it is disgusting, stuff like that really happens and Kim sounded pretty close to the real thing. I would recomend this CD to certain extent."
3,"Overrated, slighty dated, but still brilliant in spots","3 1/2I will agree with the majority that Eminem's 2nd major release was his strongest, lyrically and creatively- but I will not go so far as to call this album a masterpiece, or even a classic. For every innovation there is a mediocrity. For every genre-busting crossover ""Stan"" or brilliantly deranged ""Kim"" there are just as many generic party anthems dwelling in the forgettable. No one can deny however, when Dre's production truly rises to Eminem's lyrical best- as brief segments of the record often flirt with, mainstream hip hop had risen to a new standard."
3,decent....but could be better,"After listening to the Slim Shady LP and some of Eminem's underground stuff, i was looking foward to getting this album. However, i was kind of dissapointed after listening to this album. Eminem is a talented rapper, but it gets kind of boring hearing him make fun of celebritys and gays. The best track on this album is Stan, which is one of his best songs. It has a important message, and he didn't need to make fun of anybody to get his point across. I am a Eminem fan, but this album isn't really that great."
5,Clarification...,"""Do you fools listen to music, or do you just skimp through it?""Powerful words from Jay-Z on the ""Renegades"" track off his Blueprint LP, and never before have they been more true.People dis Em because they say he complains too much and just wants people to feel sorry for him. That's not what it is. If you looked a bit deeper into the message he was trying to convey, you'd find that this album is the story of Marshall Mathers. A biography from Marshall's point of view. The first album was from Slim Shady's point of view.Em speaks the anger that's on his mind. I'll bet that everybody goes through a period of anger through something way less significant than the matters that Eminem speaks of on this album.This LP is nothing short of brilliant, Dre's production shines and Em has genius lyrics. If you skimp through music as the quote above states, then you will not appreciate this album as much as it deserves to be. But if you look a little deeper you'll find a masterpiece."
5,HOT,"The darkest of Eminem's three albums. Though a little immature at times, he lives up to his poterntial"
3,Brutality at its best,Well if u r one of those ppl hu love violent rap lyrics. this is 4 u. Im not one of those ppl but i still think this album is well presented. i like how eminem is prooud of being white instead of just trying to be black
3,curious...,"Once apon a time (not so very long ago at all) you heard a song on the radio, found out it was a #1 ranking song, and could go to the store (or Amazon!) and buy it on an incredibly overpriced single. But that was fine, because you had your song you liked, and didn't have 16 some others you couldn't stand, like you'd end up with if only a full album were available. Well, song singles are becoming extinct and now we are all, more often than not, faced with the perplexing question 'to buy the entire album or not?' In Eminem's case with this album, it's a shame I must say it, but I'll have to pass. I adore 'The Real Slim Shady.' I think is shows pure ingenuity and talent. And I don't mind the profanity or the people bashing, but there is one song on this album, one I have not seen one complimentary comment made by any reviewer (thankfully) that makes it impossible for me to even consider buying it for myself - 'Kim'."
3,Overrated. Nothing compared to The Eminem Show,"This album is extremelly overrated. I didn't say I didn't like it but sort of regret buying it. I brought it because this album is supposed to be gritty, hardcore and one of Eminem's best work. This album...is NOTHING compared to The Eminem Show. Only a few decent tracks on this album. The Eminem Show - ALL the tracks are good. There is harldy any consistancy in this album. The Eminem Show - true consistancy. If you people think this is good then I beg you to purchase The Eminem Show because this is nothing compared to The Eminem Show album"
1,0 stars... will the real poser please stand up?,"This guy is talentless. He's on MTV yet mocks MTV. Hypocrite. He writes songs about himself and how hard his life is/was. Redundant. He writes songs about people that don't like him/he doesn't like. Boring. The songs are stale, the beats are wannabe, and the voice/lyrics are really stupid. Eminem is for kids who don't know any better. If you are an adult and you own Eminem, shame on you.Eminem has opened the flood gates for MTV manufactured, talentless posers who seem to want to just look tough yet cute and sing about how hard life is and use the same sounds over and over again in each ""song"". Please throw away your Eminem material. Don't sell it, just toss it. Thre is NO WAY that Eminem is cool. After a few years pass and the kiddies grow up, this will be (already is) an abomination to music collections through time."
2,The Beginning of a Legend,"Arrival, the first 4 episodes in the Dragonball Z series, takes place a while after the Dragonball series left off. It introduces Gohan, Goku's son and sets up the storyline for Dragonball Z. It features the evil villian, Raditz, and is filled with great action scenes. I suggest this DVD for any anime fans that love great action toons. This is also appropriate for smaller fans, I'd say 5 and up."
2,i like DBZ but not when its censored,"not when its censored. this verison was done by Pioneer Animation thats why there is no uncensored version of it. Personaly i think its a waste of resources and money, to put an uncensored verion of a movie or a series in a DVD. but Pioneer Animation messed up and did that.This volume starts the whole DBZ series. this is where we first learn Goku's reala origin. it picks up where the regular Dragonball left off, for those of you that are familiar with the regular Dragonball. this volume goes by so fast because a lot of things happen in such a short time. GOku's brother comes to earth to remind him of his true identity, that all saiyans are born to dominate and destroy the weak. Goku being the defender of the weak, has to defend his home along with a very unlikey ally..."
1,"Give me more , will ya ?","This dvd stinks , don't buy it . It has no Japanese version and that is the only reason to buy dbz dvd so we TRUE fans can escape from this english [stuff] on tv . If your a fan of english dbz , no hard feelings , buy the vhs version it is cheaper and the same thing . This dvd has 4 episodes . The first episode is really two epps . It was edited so much that they mixed the second to fill in the space . Only buy this dvd if you enjoy getting riped off ."
1,"OHH no, not a EDITED (! ) version.....","This DVD would be great if there was a uncut, unedited version on it. But NOOO... VOLUME 1 UNTIL 17 EDITED ON DVD! WHY? WHY is my question. The only reason that I not buyed the VHS version is that it was EDITED. I thought it would be different.... BUT NOOOO. WHY? It couldn't be so hard to change it? YOU made it EDITED, so u can ""UNEDIT"" it! (I think FUNimation and Saban have also the japanese version). (It's even easier to unedit it in stead of editing). FUNimation, why don't you understand that this is, what the DBZ fan wants? It's a crying shame...."
3,"The picture is not good on this DVD, don't konw why","Only this one have bad quality during the movie, maybe something wrong with pioneer the company who made the disc or maybe i got a bad quality disc, anyway whose fault is it? Pioneer."
1,DBZ-Three letters that make anime lovers everywhere cringe,"DBZ is only technically anime. Any true anime lover out there would tell you that they wouldn't wish DBZ on their worst enemy. I only care enough to warn those beginning their collection (or worse, seeing their first anime) To steer clear of DBZ, for you will forever hate anime. Friends of mine think I'm childish because I'm an anime lover and they saw DBZ. I've only seen about 10 episodes of it (I kept telling myself ""IT MUST GET BETTER. IT MUST GET BETTER"" to no avail). Oh, I see the merchandice-toting mobsters outside my door now. Goodbye"
4,A good start,"Dragon Ball Z is one of best anime ever created and this video is where it all started. This video and it's battle is great, it's not the best in the DBZ series, but it is a taste of what will come. It's to bad we cant't get DBZ subtitled in the US because the US dub isin't even half as good as the original. However DBZ is still one of the best shows in America and you have to watch this video to know what I mean."
3,Nicely done animation,"Dragon Ball Z has very good animation, however, its characters, known as 'Saiyans', are far too powerful and the story isn't the greatest. Good if you are young, just want to expand your anime collection, or don't really go for the story but the good artwork involved. Otherwise, I would reccomend something like 'Akira' or 'Fushigi Yuugi'."
2,Great if you like WWF Wresteling.,"DragonBall seems to attract an almost fanatical following, so take the five star reviews with a grain of salt when reading them.This title will be great for you if you like posturing characters, cheezy dailogue, and *lots* of fights and action sequences. It seems to be a favorite among male anime fans in the 10-16 year old range. If you are looking for a gift title to give a boy in this age range, then this is a good choice. It has violence, but little else to offend.Older viewers will most likely find this title annoying, and would be best served looking to another title as a first pick. A good recommendation would be Ranma 1/2, which is also available through Amazon.com."
2,Disappointing,"I am a big fan of DBZ (and anime in general), but have always wanted to see the original, unedited, Japanese-language version of the shows. When I saw that the shows were available on DVD, I was thrilled that I might at last get the opportunity to see the original versions. However, upon receiving the first 4 volumes, I was extremely disappointed to find that only the edited American versions were on the DVDs. If you're looking for the original version as an option, make sure the DVD offers that feature."
4,Matt's Review,"Ok if you want the dead truth I would buy this video if I were just coming into the DBZ thing because it has the first three episodes that really set up the whole plot which would help you if haven't seen them, and if you watch the show you'll see what I mean.But this is only my suggestion, anyway I'm a big fan of DBZ. NOTICE : If I were you I would BUY THIS VIDEO !"
4,ONE STEP BENEATH EXCELLENCE,"At 1773 pages, the ""Manual of Clinical Microbiology"" is a good (medium size) reference for a clinical or diagnostic microbiologist. It offers detailed information on both practical and theoretical aspects of the subject. Its authority is unquestionable. Pathologists, doctors, pharmacists, nurses, and anybody whose business concerns infectious diseases will find the book useful.The only setback is that it is awkwardly expensive. Many potential buyers would be enticed by cheaper alternatives: there are lots of them out there."
1,Fake perfume,"It looks absolutely like the real one but I've had it before and cannot make a mistake. It's close to the real fragrance, but lasts no more than 10 min. Now I use it for home fragrance, or fabric refresher but I believe Febreze is a way better. I had never had a fake product from amazon, but I believe I'm not trying the perfumes anymore"
4,Becomming a classic in the Dior line,"As Poison has become the ultimate classics in the Dior line, so will J'adore. It is very sweet, can be a bit too strong but very nice nontheless. I use it as an everydayer."
1,90 grams isn't 32 ounces,The item description says 32 ounces and the picture says 90 grams (3 ounces). Which is it?
2,Needs more practice,"Although the production on this CD is very good, I think Mr. Bright needs to improve his ability to solo. At times, his tone sounds rough. Sometimes,he also plays out of tune. I hope he will improve on future projects."
2,Does this book have a sequel that I don't know about?,I have to say that I was somewhat disgusted when I finished reading this book. It had good ideas yet the story just didn't appeal to me at all. The main character seemed to have an attitude and many things were unexplained. The story has potential if it was extended into a series. I felt as though things were just beginning and I was just beginning to find things out when the story suddenly ended. Hopefully there is a sequel that I'm unaware of to balance this odd work out.
1,Really disapointing,I can't say I liked this book. I found it was incredibly boring with no writing style whatso ever. And the plot could have been taken from a 'typical science fiction' receipe book. Honestly. I barely managed to finish it. Thora had potential. Nothing else did. She didn't even change in the course of the book. Leave this one in the bookshelf. Its not worth the time.
3,mooncalled,are we talking about the same book i loved it and after 9 yrs still want it in my library my kids tore my copy in half and have been forlorn to replace it for years and yes if there is a sequill i want that too.
1,Dick Morris Simply a Disgruntled Employee,"This Book has Absolutley No Redeeming Quality and is just another Way For Dick Morris to get back at his former Boss because Bill Clinton had to ask for Morris's Resignation after Morris was Involved in a scandal of having an Extra Martial Affair! If Dick Morris was So Upset and Outraged by Bill and Hillary Clinton, why Continue to work for them?? Anyone who takes the time to write a book in which the theme of the book is to simply trash another Book, that author is in need of Help and Counseling. It is obvious that Dick Morris has an Obsession with Hillary Clinton and that he is Clearly Jealous of her! Dick Morris should just go slither back under the rock that he came from! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS TRASH!"
1,"Liar, Liar","If you read this book and feel that it's the truth, read The Clinton Wars by Sidney Blumenthal and A Vast Conspiracy from Jeff Toobin. Those books contain more facts, sources, and history that ""back up"" what Sen. Clinton writes in her book. Morris is so blinded by his jealousy that he can' see straight and it shows in this book."
1,"More Lies From A Toe-Sucking, Right-Wingnut Hack","Ho-hum, another work of fabrication by that paragon of virtue, Dick Morris. Without him, where would the hookers that specialize in having their toes sucked find a paying customer? For those stupid and/or corrupt enough to actually pay money for potential toilet paper, take comfort in the knowledge that your dollars will end up in the bank account of a whore."
1,Needs therapy,This is an author in need of some serious therapy. Reminds me of a 10 year old boy who gets caught telling lies then blames everyone else for making him tell the lies. Incredible mindset here.
3,Some truth behind the sales pitch!!!!,"This book can be taken two ways: A person that wants to make a quick buck off of raking the coals over one of the most popular first ladies of recent years or a person that is revealing the Mr. Hyde side of the Dr. Jekyll Hillary.I, personally, have always believed Hillary to be an ambitious lady willing to stop at nothing for power. One has to remember no further back than when Bill ran for President the first time and she was the happy, loving Mrs. Bill Clinton who suddenly transformed into Hillary Rodham Clinton upon his election. Despite my agreement with the author that she is marketing an artificial image for personal gain, I found this book to reach the limits of the Clinton bashing in an effort to make money. I recommend that the readers take heed to the message of the book without taking the actual scriptures too serious."
5,What a bee-yatch!,"I always knew she was not as she appeared. What a nice exposure of what a modern day witch she is. I will definitely not vote for her in any elections. Thank you, Dick Morris."
5,Is it fair to use the same letter twice in rating this book?,"Amazon, it doesn't seem very fair to use the same comments from the same writer twice to rate this book. Why not use the comments of the writer giving this book 5 stars twice as well, this would be much more fair in rating this book, don't you think? Duplicating only the writer's comments which gave this book 1 star has skewed the results, or don't you see it that way? Obviously this duplication has dropped the Morris book down to 2.5 stars, not a very ""sporting"" thing to do is it Amazon? My rating of 5 stars will at least make this an even match again--unless you have some other agenda."
4,Mrs. President?,"I'm assuming that what Clinton wrote in 'Living History' is entirely contrary to what Morris wrote in 'Rewriting History'. So, I chose only to read this one and take into account that her version would be the exact opposite of what he wrote. I hope dearly that she's not elected in 2008 or any other year and (God help us is if she is) that she's completely through a hormone-driven emotional menopause if she is. Having said that, this book is written with so much animosity. I wish Morris had just stuck to reporting the facts with a little less melodrama."
5,For anyone who thinks Hillary should be president...,"For anyone who thinks Hillary should be our next president, I highly recommend reading this book. For anyone who thinks Hillary DOESN'T need to be president...you also need to read it! Dick Morris was an insider, he knows and writes the truth! Do you want to know the truth or do you choose to ignore it?"
1,Propaganda at its best,"This is another example of the conservative dominated media pandering to the public. Despite what he claims, Morris realizes that the country is conservative leaning today (despite being liberal leaning when you evaluate Americans views on each individual issue) and sees an opportunity to make money by giving the public what they want to hear.PS: Before you respond to conservative media comment, remember the primary purpose of the media in our capitalist society is to make money (not reporting the facts). Therefore, if you continually give consumers news that shows that they are wrong in their beliefs, they'll tune out (i.e. report the facts in a non-bias manner when the country is conservative leaning, especially since 9/11). In all fairness, the media was liberal leaning in the 60s because the country was leaning that direction. However, Reagan made sure that trend didn't continue (at least when he was awake a cabinet meetings)."
1,Once again!,Haven't we heard enough of this idiot?? He is about as reliable as a rock. Nothing in this book is factual.
1,What a load of crap !!!,This book is so partisan and filled with opinions masked as facts that I couldn't finish it. What a waste of dead trees.
2,A weak and padded book from nihilistic Dick Morris,"Hillary Clinton is a cold fish who has the same traits as Richard Nixon. She does not abide criticism, is secretive and imagines conspiracies when she makes mistakes. She deliberately lied about where she was during the 2003 blackout in order to appear ""just folks"" to New Yorkers. She is a feminist icon but lets herself play the weak, credulous victimized wife of the man whom ""she knows better than anyone else""(sic). Hillary also tried to gain sympathy by falsely claiming daughter Chelsea was in danger on 9/11. She rode Bill Clinton's coattails in Arkansas for monetary gain and Washington for political gain but pretends she made it on her own.There. I just saved you four hours and 20 bucks."
3,"Yes, but...","I'll tell you what. As a right-winger myself, I can say flat-out that I have no respect for Morris. He compromised the values he had to be another Clinton lapdog. And now, when it is no longer politically expedient to be associated with them, he turns on them. And as far as Hillary goes, brother, let me say this: hatred drives this woman. Her hatred for America and the American people is second only to her hatred for her own background."
2,Could have been better...,"This book just wasn't written in a way that made me enjoy it. The facts that were presented just felt too dramatic, and instead of making me a believer, I felt like I was listening to the petty ""I don't like you"" fights of 6th grade girls.And I don't even like her."
3,"Why does Dick Morris always pick on Hillary? I can't be objective, but ...","I personally really like Dick Morris, and respect his thinking and product, overall. But, I think Hillary is absolutely perfect and beautiful, yet he just does not seem to like her. I can't understand that, but I still really like Morris, and I truly love Hillary, forever. The book is interesting, though I don't know how accurate and objective it is. Decide for yourself, but if it's about Hillary, it will always be an interesting read. I guarantee it!"
4,Decent read - excellent for a flight.,Dick Morris is a good writer. I fount that this book is very well organized and all the sources are clearly identified. The conclusions seem somewhat outrageous at times but easily accepted as just the authors' opinions. My book was autographed by Mr. Morris at a book signing and I was impressed by his book introduction. I still think 'Off with Their Heads' was a better read.
1,"Nothing to see here, folks, go read a real book","This book claims she is self-centered, a control-freak, insincere and vindictive when provoked. Do readers really believe other politicians (their heroes)are any different??The American political process has become nothing but a series of personal, unsubstantiated attacks, and it's being led primarily by Republicans, and it works. Scary for the future of democracy, I'm not kidding. Go read a book about Germany in the 1920s and really learn something."
1,Where are our views?,"If Dick Morris is going to write a book about Hillary Clinton, I think it would have been wise to talk to people who know her i.e. her friends and family. Dick Morris sees things from a very distorted angle. I am glad this book is a flop!"
1,Who wrote this?,"I received the free Chapter 1 by email, and read up to the line: ""When Al Gore claimed to be the father of the Internet..."" What? That old chestnut? Sure, a lot of people believed it, but I can't conceive that Dick Morris, who was in the Clinton administration, does not know better. It leaves me wondering who *really* wrote this book."
1,Laughing Stock,Dick Morris has made himself the laughing stock of the publishing industry by writing this book. I am just glad Hillary has stayed above the fray and shown herself to be the classy intellectual she is! Go Hillary!
1,Sour Grapes - AVOID THIS BOOK,"Why anyone would purchase this book is far beyond my comprehension; I was misled, misinformed, and mistaken. Having read some of the fiction Mr. Morris has written previously this appeared to be THE one book in which he examined the day-to-day events of Hillary; unfortunately, this was not the case.Mr. Morris should ""stick"" to creating fiction of his own; this book was poorly written, poorly organized, and woefully lacking in FACTS and CREDIBILITY.I ""wasted"" my money purchasing this book. It tells nothing new about Hillary; however, it says volumes about Mr. Morris and his sour grapes about having been left out of the POWER GROUP.Save your money - AVOID THIS BOOK."
2,Rewriting History,"He writes well and it is an interesting read, yet so many ofthe criticisms are subjective nonsense that could be dumped onany female national politician. Clinton will continue as an effective politician and Morris, as fly on the wall will fade with time. This book is a popcorn partisan read - Those at Fox would welcome such a book!!"
1,6th grader essay without back-up,"When I read Morris's book, I felt like I was reading a 6th grader essay: A lot of claims with no real evidence to back it up. I would like to actually read something where Morris can make an argument and actually have references to validate what he's saying. That's my major complaint which left me unsatisfied with the content in the book."
1,Morris the Leetch,"I read half the book so I cannot give a full review, but thus far, it is mostly garbage. I'll plod thru the rest, but after reading Morris in the NY Post for the past few years, there is not much new here. Save your money, the book smacks of jealousy"
2,Damn the Truth: Full Speed Ahead,"This book appears to be a whiney ""tell all"" that adds to the difficulty political figures will have, in the present and future, in trusting their most trusted aides! Morris posits many judgements about Mrs. Clinton that appear to have been inspired by personal pique rather than political/personal truth. Another example for this society that truth has been the biggest victim of this generation of writers."
5,Madame Hillary,"I wonder if all the top leaders of the Democratic Party and the Senate are all giving out orders to give 1 star reviews to every single right-wing book. Look at the average number of stars on Left-wing books and then look at right-wing books. Maybe the amount of liberals outnumbers conservatives on this site but it seems to me they're a mission to give 1 star reviews to EVERY conservative book out there. Being the supposed party of ""tolerance"" look at the names liberals give Republicans and Conservative. Well, I guess if you're in the majority then tolerance no longer applies to you. I commend Dick Morris for revealing Hilary's reign of terror whether it's piggy-backing her ""hubby"" Bill or using New York to get further. If anyone wants the truth (or for what most of us know as the truth) read ""Re-Writing History."" By the way love the cover!"
2,Not what you expect,"I'm a conservative; no doubt what the New York Times would call the extreme, right-wing fringe.However, I found Dick Morris' book a tome that didn't want to ""dis"" Hillary as much as a man seeking to find reasons to praise her.He comes across as a true left-wing moderate, one wanting for Hillary to be bold in her espousal of left wing causes and honest in her past history.This, he reveals, she has sadly failed to do. In her laser-like focus on gaining political power, she shifts with every political poll.He reveals how she has thrown away every core principle except her pursuit of her own definition of women and children's rights.It portrays her not so much as political savant as a desperate woman seeking to validate her own life and her many ambitions.It's a difficult read for the true right wing, such as myself, however it's an entertaining discussion and Dick Morris carries the story well.It's also a telling insight in the woman who would be president."
4,Abut heavy for reading - need to be ready to,Ditto headline. Abut heavy for reading - need to be ready to read it. But accurate and should be taught everywhere. We need to stop boring Terrorism like having federal holidays that do.
1,Don't believe everything you read - this book especially...,"One reviewer claims this should be taught in schools - This is just another jewel for revisionist historians. We do not need this type of material to be taught in our public schools. Although the author claims to have used primary sources, his interpretation of these sources should be questioned. Our young children should learn to search for truth, but not be misled by one man's erroneous opinion. Undermining our History texts only teaches students to distrust teachers and schools."
5,Awesome,It was exactly what I needed to get my suspension back to normal. The stock ones had about 120k miles on them and were shot!
5,A book to read again and again!,"My grandmother gave me this book to read when I was a teenager, and in the 25 years since, I have read it over again many times. Gram told me how, as a girl, she and her friends read this book wrapped in brown paper so no one would know they were reading such a racy book! She thought it had been banned in Boston! Of course, that made it much more desirable. Each time I re-read ""Amber,"" I feel differently about the character."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed after reading this book. The book was great until the last 200 pages. It honestly became boring. I saw myself skimming through the pages waiting for something interesting to happen. The end was horrible. I also agree with the other readers that the author had nothing more to say or just got tired of writing...
5,EXCELLENT,"I LOVE historical novels, esp. ones that involve Kings and Queens! I can totally see how this novel compares to Gone with the Wind - Amber is another Scarlett, Corinna a Melanie (sort of), Bruce an Ashley, and perhaps Almsbury ended up as a Rhett (?). Although Amber does make several bad choices and uses everyone around her as a way to get what she wants, she still loved all her children and decided, finally, to go back to the country where she truly belonged. I did not much care about Charles and his family - I just wanted to hear about Amber! But, the book was awesome, and although it took me awhile to read, I could hardly ever put it down and got caught up in everything Amber did. LOVED IT!"
1,Not Crazy For Amber,"I gave this book a star only for the historical details, and for Barbara Palmer's side story. Otherwise, I didn't care for it at all. It's very long - which is fine if the content changes to keep your interest - but how many times can one really stand to read about Amber's ongoing infatuation with Bruce Carlton? The man clearly has no intentions toward her being anything more than his mistress, and yet she chases him and chases him and acts like ""a silly whore"" or ""a useless jade"" for the entire novel. A poor female character, Amber embodies every stereotype of an ill-bred country innocent. I felt sorry for Bruce Carlton, not Amber, to the point where when he strikes her, I actually was on his side. Enough with her stupidity already!"
3,Forever Amber,"This book was okay. Not very believable to me. I have read a lot of books set in times years ago, but this one just didn't ring true with me."
5,Read this book!,"This is by far one of the best books I have ever read. I truely did not want it to end and wish there was a sequel. You will be transported back in time and feel the suffering of the protagonist, Amber. You will at the same time hate her for her selfish, arrogant, decadent ways and cheer for her as she survives the horrors of London under Charles II."
5,Forever a great read,"I just reread this book for the first time in years, and couldn't put it down. From the first page, Winsor grabs the reader and takes you on an extremely entertaining, fascinating journey through one woman's life against the backdrop of Restoration-era England. Amber is far from a moral paragon, and makes foolish decisions, but her story is still gripping years after this book was written. Other historical romances are pallid when compared with this vivid narrative."
4,Still readable after all these years,I first read Forever Amber back in the 60s and have to laugh when I realize that everything I know about 17th Century England I learned from this book. It's very well researched and extremely readable. I recommend it!
4,Incredibly fun reading.,"Supposedly the first ""Romantic novel"" ever published, Forever Amber details a life of a 90's woman living in the 30's....she's just a tad ahead of her time. You will recognize current day New Yorker mentality in her because she knows what she wants and stops at nothing to get her man!! Makes for light fun reading.... and ""sexual"" scenes are hardly what we consider to be so nowadays. Fun for your teenage daughters to read...a love story without the steammmmmmm."
2,Wretched Ending,"The book was absolutely captivating. I passionately hoped that Amber and Lord Carlton's would persevere and they would marry despite the fact that she was supposedly the daughter of a country man. Which she was not, she was actually the offspring of great and powerful people, this was never discovered by Amber or Lord Carlton which disappointed me. But i still had hope that they would still marry but this was diminished when he married another girl that he met in Virginia while Amber slowly climbs the ladder of high society. She becomes wealthy and gets the title of a duchess. She is loved and envied. The only man she ever truly loved, Lord Carlton is now married, but i still have faith that they will be together. All my hopes shatter in the end of the book. It's a great book but the ending is wretched."
3,Took forever,"i'm actully rather conflicted. There where parts of this book i liked, but the ""heroine"" was not one of them. I found Amber St Clare to be selfish and hateful. She's the daughter of two noble people, who, due to the civil war in england, never married. Her mother died in childbirth, and her father vanished off the face of the earth.Now don't get me wrong, the book was well written. It kept me reading almost to the emd. I say almost, i couldnt stand the repetiveness any longer. there were no sex scenes to speak of.What i did like . The way Bruce and Amber struggled to get through the plague together.What i didn't like. An event like that should bring two people together, it does not.The book ends rather abruptly, with no real resolution for either the charatrers, or the reader."
1,Forever Amber,"I read Forever Amber as a teenager and did not remember the ending. On reading it now, I realize that I didn't want to remember the ending. It's a most depressing morality play that leads the reader down a dark emotional hole. I don't recommend it unless you are judgmental and will be happy to cheer for the utter demise of Amber and her dreams."
2,Disappointed,"This book was recommended to me by someone who knew of my entrancement with Gone With the Wind. All I can say is Amber is no Scarlett O'Hara. I would have enjoyed the book far more had it just been a work of historical fiction without the lovesick heroine who I did not feel anything for other than pity involved. There were storylines in the book that I thought should have been explored and weren't. I forced myself to finish the book, because I don't like to leave books unread but this is one book that I am severely disappointed that I purchased and didn't just take out from the library."
5,Make it a Nook & Kindle Book~,Why isn't this book availabe on Nook and Kindle? Who wants to carry around a heavy book when it can be so pleasurable to read electronically?
2,Forever Amber,"The book is interesting, but the Heroine is horrible. People who pick this up because they think she is like ""GONE WITH THE WIND""'s Scarlett are going to be disappointed. Scarlett is a survivor, who (IMO) does experience some personal growth and at times was unselfish, in spite of herself. The only time Amber thought of anyone other than herself, was when Bruce was sick. Otherwise, she caused many deaths because of her stalker obsession, and only one guy really deserved it. Awful, terrible woman and the ending was not good.That said, If you like to read about Princess Diana's great great great (whatever) grandmother Barbara and Restoration England, it's a page turner-- for at least that."
4,kept you on the edge of your seat,"**don't read this unless you have already read the book**I thought it was a well wrote book, however I loved and hated Amber. I loved Bruce till he married someone else. After the plague I thought that was it they would finally get together, but he left her again. She made so many mistakes, if she only had gone back to where she was raised and at least talked to them. Geez, I was just constantly hoping the whole book she would, which never happened. I guess it is always good to have a book in there that the ending is not what you want. But it is so heart breaking when they don't. It was definatley a classic, but not one of my favorites, my favorite will always be the Liz Curtis Higgs series Thorn in my heart. However Through the glass darkly was a lot like this book, it was also good."
2,forever incomplete!!,"Forever Amber was a complete disappointment! The book was interesting and the history intriguing, but I was utterly thwarted by the absolute lack of character development. The author never explains or alludes to the reason Bruce won't marry Amber. The book lacks a climatic ending. What happened to Amber's family, her father? She never finds out about her mother? These questions were never answered! I was so frustrated!!! I also got bored with the repetitive story...it was so long one would expect Winsor to answer these unanswered questions. She simply did not complete the story and I was left feeling relieved that it was finely over and aggravated with the crappy ending."
3,"Elegant Writing, yet not Satisfying","Forever Amber may be historically accurate, yet it is not a satisfying novel. Winsor has an elegant writing technique and conveys her words well, but, at times, I have asked myself ""Why didn't she end here?""The entire novel would have been classical if a few of Amber's husband's were deleted and her escapades overlooked. But, instead, reality fades away into an absurd amount of ""fluff"" and unreal situations.Overall, I enjoyed the novel for I wanted something just to read. Yet, the familiar sense of satisfaction that envelopes me after reading a wonderful novel had slipped from my grasp after reading this selection.I shall recomend this book only if one has time on their hands and desires a book that will merely be for idle reading."
3,Mixed Emotions,"I varied from pity to disgust in regards to the main character. I can see why the book was banned in Boston when it came out in 1944, but is pretty mild by today's standards (unfortunately!).It is worth reading - a good, settling into book."
4,"Really good fiction, great sense of place","Forever Amber is a striking novel, maybe even five stars, but the rest of Kathleen Windsor's writing is forgettable, unfortunately. I think success ruined her. Or she was a one novel author from the start."
5,Don't Miss This One,"I first read Forever Amber when I was in college many decades ago and have re read this book several times since then. It's rich and sassy and so very well written that it has been my favorite book for many years. Read it, if you haven't, and recommend it to a friend if you have."
5,The only possible equal of GWTW,"""Forever Amber"" is the only book that to my mind can stand alongside my all-time favorite novel, ""Gone with the Wind"". I've read both several times in the past 8 or so years, and each time is better than the last. The endings of each especially appeal to me."
3,Kept my attention for the most part,"This book kept my attention for the most part. If you like a book that some what follows history you will enjoy this read. I liked the history part however the author is very detailed and I could have used a little less description. I would have given this book more stars if it had ended the way I wanted it too. There is a twist at the end. This book has adventure, history, romance."
3,Forever Amber forever long long book,"Amber is the (trashy) Scarlet O'Hara of London. I wonder if Kathleen Winsor read Gone With The Wind herself before writing Forever Amber? The story of Amber is very very long. I must say, I was disappointed in the book. Maybe you'll like it better than I did. Another thing that is done over and over again in this book is abortions and women who on purpose cause themselves to miscarriage."
5,rivoting read,"Bought second hand but in perfect condition,actually had to look twice to see if it was new.Great value for money"
5,Makes you feel like you are right there,I loved every last page of this huge book. The storytelling made me feel like I was right there. I could see the sights and smell the smells and hated the moment it was over.
4,Looks long...Feels Short,"When I picked up ""Forever Amber"" I wasn't sure if I'd be able to finish it. Unless a book is really, really good (like Gone With the Wind) I won't finish it if it's 600+ pages long. But this book was surprisingly good. From the moment it began to the moment it ended, I couldn't stop reading it. The story is about a precocious girl named Amber who will sleep with anyone and stab anyone in the back to get what she wants.The only problem I had with the novel, was it's characters. Amber was a disgusting, selfish girl, and Bruce was a stupid, selfish man. I thought that the characters should have been a little bit more likable (especially Amber, who I'm pretty sure you were supposed to sympathize with). Overall, I give this book 4 stars; I took one away because of Amber. Sorry, Kathleen!"
4,Forever Amber,"If you like historic romances, then this book is for you. All in all the book is very good, very well written, specially if you want details of what life was like during the times of Restoration England. The main character is very young and beautiful and makes a lot of mistakes, but the time it takes her to learn from them doesn't seem to interfere with her goals which obviously include getting into Court as well as the Kings bed. Lots of romance, love, hate, vengance and sex without it being explicit, leaving it up to your imagination. Couldn't put it down!"
3,WHAT HAPPENED AT THE END?,"I will make this short and sweet. Why did I read this book to find that the last 200 pages spun out of control and had nothing to do with the main character....Read because it is such an interesting story. The main character has no morals whatsoever but it doesn't seem like anyone did back in these days.SPOILER ALERT:My problem is that I invested, as I do with every book, my emotions to find out that Amber never learns who she truly is. Hello, give the story an end. Let it be that she never finds the true love in the end but at least she knows that she came from something she always wanted?! I am just so confused. I read somewhere that when Kathleen Winsor submitted the book to a publishing company they pretty much cut in half. Bad publishing company. They could have made this book a true classic had they given the story a complete end. It just stopped. Ugh!!! So frustrating!!!"
3,soapy trashy fun,"First, I disagree with the description on the back cover of the book, hailing this work as a ""timeless masterpiece"". OK, OK, it's a fun read and all, but it is at heart simply soapy trash set in Restoration England. It's really not all that different from lots of other books and movies about gold-digging girls. Nevertheless, you'll find this book hard to put down."
2,I forced myself to finish,"I do not insist that I love or identify with the protagonist of a story. Rarely have I disliked one as much as Amber. Not for any moral reasons, though she is vapid, greedy, and (spoiler)somewhat murderous. I found that to be fairly accurate of the times in which she lived. As another reviewer noted, the story goes on a loop. I love you Bruce! Bruce leaves! Amber becomes involved with someone else....just rather tiring. Amber is naive in the beginning, but doesn't seem to learn from her mistakes. I would say I disliked her most for that.I did enjoy the portrayal of Charles II and the events surrounding the story-hence the two stars."
4,Excellent Recipes!,"I used this book along with the 30-Day Gourmet and Frozen Assets book for my first freezer cooking adventure. This one has the BEST recipes- can't go wrong! It is not formatted for bulk cooking though, so I used the 30-Day Gourmet book's format (which is excellent!)and some of its recipes AND information and some recipes from Frozen Assets for my adventure. I am very pleased and am going to cook more and more of the recipes from the Best Freezer Cookbook. Make sure you try the Best Meatloaf (or whatever the name is) recipe!!! I used it for loaves and balls and have served them with sauces found in the 30-Day book to our delight every time!"
2,Misses key Vista features!,I went to the Search Inside box and typed in a few new Vista features such as ReadyBoost (a feature that allows you to use a USB 2.0 key flash drive as a fast paging device) and they were not found in the book. So this book is already way out of date.
1,Be Careful ... Beta Version Book,"This book was released last July, a full 6 months before the official release of Vista. This means the information used to publish it was from an early Beta version. A LOT has changed with Windows Vista since then, so I find it hard to believe this book would be very useful. Please note that I have NOT purchased/read this book. I just doubt that this would be a very good user guide/manual. It's only a PREVIEW book. Just throwing caution to the wind ... Caveat Emptor!"
4,Windows Vista Beta:,"This book is about the Beta, not the finished version of Windows Vista, therefore, a good deal, but not all of the information contained pertains to the released product. I have however, found things I never knew existed in Vista. So overall, I have found this to be an informative and interesting book. Definetely not a waste of money. MJ"
4,"""Introducing Microsoft Windows Vista""","This was the first book I purchased and read. Although it is based on beta prerelease versions of ""Windows Vista"" it did come in very handy at times. I'm giving it 4 rating due to fact of it being based and written off of beta versions of ""Windows Vista"" and something's have changed.Dennis KBest Buy Geek Squad IT technician"
4,"It's not just a ""preview""","Well, I've been running the Beta version at home for about 6 months now, and the book was adequate for learning some of the new tricks and tips."
4,Food for thought,"I read this book a few years ago (knowing almost nothing about Timothy Leary, except his status as a 60's icon) and really enjoyed it. It helped me to redefine the way I think about pleasure and society's relationship to it. I was raised with such a puritanical ""if it feels good, it must be evil"" way of thinking that Leary's point of view - ""if it feels good, it's probably good for you"" - was downright liberating for me. Although I don't subscribe to everything Leary says in the book (for example, I don't think doing LSD once a week is a good idea), his essays are always provocative and full of food for thought. Even if you're put off by Leary's associations with hippie and drug cultures, I'd still recommend reading this book. Leary was an intelligent man with ideas worth listening to."
5,Wonderful!!!,"This book is wonderful! Its very honest in understanding Timothy Leary's mind. If you can get your male partner to read this one, you will have made great strides in what we need and desire from them!"
3,This bodkin vs. my trusty safety pin...,It works just fine but it hasn't replaced my safety pin. My trusty safety pin does the same job and does it well for a fraction of the price.

2,A Year to Live,"A Year To Live by Levine proves the old saying: ""There's nothing new under the sun."" This book, which claims to be on the cutting edge, might offer something to someone who has never given the subject of dying a second thought, but the banal, maudlin, self righteous approach left this listener - I bought the tape - begging for silence. On top of that, Mr. Levine reads his work as though he were trying to induce a hypnotic trance or s p e a k i n g to the mentally impaired."
2,Not very practical,"This book has potential but it does not spell out very clearly what to do, How to Live This Year As If It Were Your Last. It is mostly poetic and full of jargon that the average person will not relate to. Maybe if one knows his language from being more familiar with the author it would be more clear, but this book on it's own is not easy to ""grok"". I like the premise but it's not a very useful book. It might be improved if there were a ""workbook"" with which to pair the poetic with the practical ""how to"" aspects of such an ""experiment""."
4,moving and helpful even for the non-religious,"I'm not a Buddhist or anything else, and I don't often find ""spiritual"" reading very accessible, as it often strikes me as vague, abstract, and jargon-y. I didn't think this was the best-written book I've ever read--Mr. Levine, please, please, please look up the definition of ""enormity"" before you write another word--but I nevertheless found the insights unusually moving and helpful in a practical sense."
2,Inferior sequel - more mean than funny...,"Talk about cold leftovers. ""Darwin Awards #2"" is as weak as most sequels to successful 'humour' books. I read the first volume aloud to my friend while on vacation - at one point he fell to the floor laughing. (I think it was the story about the sad sad man who clipped dozens of bunjee cords together and forgot that those cords do stretch. He leaped from a high place, and hit the ground like a rock. He died of course.)The first ""Darwin Awards"" was hysterical. Virtually all of this sequel is obvious filler that was rejected for the first edition. Interestingly, the focus of the second book shifts from seriously dull people doing idiotic things with predictable outcomes. It shifts to average people dying from too common bad luck. And that's not funny - just sad. This book left me cranky & paranoid.(If you do buy this version, I'd suggest ripping out the 4 or 5 funny entries and folding them into the first ""Darwin Awards"". I won't be waiting for a 3rd volume."
1,Get Her Out of the Gene Pool!,"That this author sets herself up as arbiter of who among us are too stupid to live is appalling. That she relishes the report of a hapless Bedouin shepherd shot to death by a wayward sheep stepping on his unsecured rifle funny enough to warrant a pun (and a bad one at that), ""ewethanasia,"" is puzzling. What is amusing about careless, but innocent people wounding or killing themselves? Where are the chuckles this arrogant writer claims to offer readers?I welcome gallows humor that's crisp, novel, and <*gasp*> enlightening. There's plenty around...try the Annals of Improbable Research (AIR) and its IgNoble Prizes, f'rinstance. You want funny? You want depraved funny? You want good writing? Try The Onion. Two different genres, but then, Northcutt is in a class by herself...too bad she may be spreading her genes around...."
2,Second volume a weaker effort,"The first volume of this series was great. This volume is considerably weaker. I can't believe it, but perhaps the gene pool has thinned out most of the idiots so there isn't as much stupidity to report."
3,It's amazing we've survived this long!,"How the human species has survived is a mystery to me after reading this entertaining book. From people trying to save chickens in a well and drowning themselves (the chicken flew out), to a six-foot man diving into a four-foot pool, to my personal favorite of the mother smearing her son with honey to get a good picture of a bear -- I have little hope we will survive much longer. I will say that after several accounts, one's head begins to spin, and the references to other accounts after every entry is confusing. I did enjoy the introductions to each chapter, which dealt with science and other related topics. Fun read."
1,"Put me in the ""save your money"" camp","Helloo? Haven't we SEEN this all for FREE on line?????Talk about a waste of bucks -- this is all old rehashed ""it's been on the net, but I've collected it in a book.""Shame shame!! Bad bad!! (But gotta give the author credit for cashing in, I guess....)Word to the wise: Don't bother."
3,ha ha,"Funny book, except the author is obviously biased against men. It doesn't take much research to turn up the fact that women are much stupider (in general) when it comes to basic common sense stuff. Thus, there should be at least as many instances of stupid women snuffing themselves out as there are of men. This book is better than the previous one in this aspect. However, she still hardly touches on this vast sea of unused book fodder."
3,Meh ... not much new material here,"If you read the first of this series, you really needn't bother with this one. Unlike most series out there, it makes no difference which order you read these in. Just a collection of stories of people who are too stupid to be alive, and aren't. However, one glaring flaw in this book is the constant listings of tales that are ""unconfirmed by Darwin"". If the story is unconfirmed, essentially meaning it is untrue, why put it in a book of ""true stories"". A few of these false Darwin's would be OK, but this book is nearly half full of these falsehoods. It was a little disappointing. However, it is amusing to read the tales and imagine what kind of morons would partake in such activities. Really you could read any of the books in this series; they are essentially the same, so if you have a choice between the 3 (so far) pick the cheapest.T"
4,Not As Good as the First,"The Second Edition of Darwin Awards is not nearly as funny as the first. It is usually the case that the sequel is a bit of a let down. This book is appropriate for its use, a book from which you can read a few pages each day.A good addition to this book is the ""Not A Darwin Award"" Chapter in which the author shows stories which were unable to receive a Darwin Award for various reason. If nothing else, this demonstrates the logic behind the awards. The book has many entertaining stories which demonstrate that there are a lot of stupid people in the world. It is all the more reason for the intelligent ones like us to be careful.My strongest objection to this book was chapter of recycled classic stories from the first edition. I would prefer to read new stories rather than ones I have already read. If somebody has not ready those stories, they really should buy the first edition. The second edition is also worth the price."
3,Entertaining... In a way...,"Here is the much talked about Darwin awards, where dumb people do dumb things and usual end up dead. A lot of people have said that the book is hilarious, but actually, it's just okay. ... but It's meant to be funny, but it doesn't quite strike a chord with me. Still, it's definitedly a good way to kill time... Worth checking out."
2,Wasn't impressed,"I picked this up for my Dad to read during his chemotherapy sessions. I read it first tho. I wasn't impressed.Tho not given a Darwin award, just honorable mention, the only truly notable one was LAWNCHAIR LARRY page 200. The very first Cluster ballooner. He was great. Google 'lawnchair larry'. He's in Wikipedia.This was my only Darwin Awards book. Maybe the first one was better. I don't think I'd do an inter-library loan to find out tho."
2,Burns their eyes and requires a lot to make bubbles,"I have to pour a ton into the water to get a nice full bubble bath. But worse than that, it burns my boys' eyes. They have bloodshot eyes and red eyelids by the end of the bath. My little one (14 months) cries if he rubs his eyes and my older boy (2 3/4 years) yells for me to dry his eyes if he touches them. It's really sad. :( I see so many great reviews, but I just don't get why. Seems like most people like for the nostalgia. I'll try Johnson and Johnson's tear free bubble bath and I hope it's better!"
5,Old School...,I'm giving this 5 stars based on the Mr. Bubble that was out when I was a kid... in a box... in powder form! Anyone else remember that? It smelled so good and some would always go up my nose LOL couldn't wait until bath time. Ahhh the glorious 70's :-)
2,Physician's report on this book compared to others,"I found this book to be quite simplistic and full of self-serving letters to the author about what a fine surgeon he is. It supplies information that is so basic that it is almost worthless. He supplies lists of questions to ask a potential surgeon, but does not discuss how to evaluate the answers one might receive. A far better book is ""A Smart Woman's Guide to Plastic Surgery"" which is full of helpful and specific information."
5,Extrememly useful book,"Thank you Dr. Kotler for publishing an extremely useful book on cosmetic surgery, especially for us Canadians. Secrets of a Beverly Hills Cosmetic Surgeon helped me find eight highly qualified cosmetic surgeons in the US with over 10 years experience, which I short listed to four. After reading the book and consulting with the four doctors I short listed, I learned what surgery I really require (and do not require) along with all the associated costs and risks. I also learned to first try collagen injections and medical pigmentation to reduce wrinkles and scars before considering cosmetic surgery, such as fat grafting. Thanks again, Dr Kotler for your very informative book."
5,Outstanding!,"I have wanted cosmetic surgery for a while now, however I did not know where to begin. I was in the library and came across this book by Dr. Robert Kotler. What a fabulous book! It explained everything. A must read for anyone considering plastic surgery."
5,Very helpful,"I wish I had access to this book three years ago. Had my nose done and it turned out poorly. Looks worse and my breathing problem is no better. After the surgery I found out my plastic surgeon had very little experience in nasal surgery. He was board certified and I thought that qualified him to do my surgery, but in fact his practice was mostly auto accidents, hand surgery and cancer work.. Dr. Kotler's book tells you how to avoid this misdirection"
5,Two Thumbs Up!,"I'm a bit of an introverted guy. I've been considering cosmetic surgery and know some people who have had it done, but was reticent about asking them. But I was hungry for knowledge and so I bought this book. The book did me a great service on two fronts. One: it gave me lots of practical, really helpful knowledge. Two: it has convinced me that I would be silly not to ask my friends about their experiences. It seems that first hand knowledge is the best way to learn."
4,Great Book to Introduce Your Child to Chaucer,"This adaption of the Nun's Priest's Tale by Chaucer is an excellent picture book to introduce your children to Canterbury Tales. Barbara Cooney won a Caldecott Award for her illustrations that beautifully reflect medieval art. In my opinion, the negative reviews of this book do not take into account that this book is an adaption of an older classic piece of literature.One criticism: I think that a more modern translation of Chaucer would help this book be more understandable for small children. I would rate the book as for 4 and older not 2 and older.Despite the older translation, my child (age 3) loves this book and asks to have it read frequently to him.I have a full review with photos and a complete summary at: [...]"
2,Won't be reading it to my children,"I read this one today to preview it for my children. While I like the moral of the story, do not trust in flattery, it comes about in a disjointed way at the end of the book. I had to read the rooster, foxes, and woman's comments twice to be sure I was getting what each one said!Throughout the book there are references to ""all the rooster's hens,"" ""his 7 wives"" and so on. I find this inappropriate for a children's book. Including ""when I see the beauty of your face...my fears die away"" and ""groan in his throat like a man troubled by his dreams."" Too many references as though this rooster is really a man. It was just a weird book to me.I will not be reading it to my children."
1,Pretty boring,Neither my kids or I found this story very engaging. Just not interesting enough to keep anyone's attention for long. Pretty boring.
4,Don't buy unless you don't mind being a coke addict,"Went through an entire bag in less than a month, eating them a handful at a time. Not sure if that says more about how good these are, or more about how much self control I have. Either way, I highly recommend these to anyone who likes gummi candy."
4,"Great Deal, dont order in the summer","I ordered these cola gummies to keep my addiction going but failed to remember that Atlanta heat (100 degrees) plus sitting at my front door equals one giant block of gummies. Yes, all 5 pounds had melted into a solid block of gummy. I have since used kitchen scissors to cut of pieces when I need a fix. I will remember to order this next time during the winter months."
2,Not impressed,Will not buy again. The flavor was not what I would call cola. they really didn't smell like any cola I have smelled. Sure won`t buy again. Really was disappointed.
4,A little bit goes a long way,"Just a note: this is a LOT of candy. If you are ordering this make sure you have a lot of friends and family that will help you finish off the bag.After the first handful (which is excellent, mind you) I was set for a few days. Apparently no one else in the house cares for gummy candy and it took me a few weeks to finish up the candy.Other than that, they taste good (although not entirely like cola) and have a good consistency."
3,yummy gummi! -- but too hard,"I love the cola flavored gummies. LOVE it! but these are a little too hard/stiff for me. VERY chewy, almost a stale type of chewy. wish it was more like the soft gummies that you can get from the grocery stores. but the flavor is good though. price is great for 5 pounds but it's only getting 3 stars. it would have gotten 5 stars if it was softer."
2,pleasant gummies,My son has accepted these gummies immediately. Their chewable form and the cola flavor are pleasant and they complete his diet so well. Besides his attention has improved and he is calmer.
2,gummy cola review,"This particular batch was lacking the usual ""fizzy"" taste and texture. However, they were sweet and chewy."
1,disappointed,These candies are not bursting with flavor. I don't know if I just got a bad batch but they are rather bland.
1,Haribo Gummi Candy Happy-Cola tastes terrible,I thought this gummy candy would taste like cola - turns out it is citrus flavored and sour. Not at all what I expected.
1,Haribo Cola Gummies,I love the regular Haribo gummie bears but these taste like artificial green lime. They do make me burp though!
1,Kinda hard... dried out?,"Received 5 lb poly bag of cola flavored gummies....very disappointing... they are harder and difficult to chew. Not like the Haribo Gummi bought at Walgreens in a small package, which were soft and easy to chew. Are these dried out? Old stock?"
1,Taste good? No. Edible? Barely.,"I took a chance on these because of all the positive reviews you find on this product on multiple websites. I ordered a 5lb bag of the Haribo Happy Cola's and I have to say I'm very disappointed. They are extremely chewy.. it's literally like chewing on a dry piece of caulk. No matter how long you chew, it doesn't break down.. it may as well be a piece of rubber. If you suck on them they last for quite some time, obviously, but that cola taste is not there. You get a slight hint of cola when you first pop one in, but after that time passes (5-10 seconds in) you're left with a wet noodle made out of caulk that tastes like corn syrup.There must be a huge group of people who like generic candy out there or a heck of a lot of Haribo workers boosting these reviews. I certainly do not see anything positive what-so-ever to write about this product and I absolutely do not recommend anyone buy these."
2,I don't know what all the fuss is about.,These are ok. The best way to describe the taste is that they taste exactly like pepsi cola that's gone flat. They're not terrible but they also aren't that great.
5,Great service!,This is my son's favorite candy. Thank you for the prompt delivery. It's exactly what I ordered!
5,Great product!,"I love any gummi products. This is definitely one of my favorite flavor. If you haven't tried it, you should."
4,arrived fresh and was good,it took a bit longer than i expected to get it in but it was certainly worth it. they are chewy just enough. and this really is quite a bit of gummy colas. they would have lasted longer buy my sister got ahold of the bag and ate half in one sitting lol! they are that good.
3,Country of Origin Changes Depending On Supplier,"I am a long time Haribo fan. I was first introduced to Haribo gummies when I moved to Germany in 1979. The Happy-Cola gummies are my all time favorite, so I have really enjoyed ordering them in the 5-pound bags over the past year.Unfortunately, the flavor of the gummies varies depending on where they are made. When I first started ordering them on Amazon's Subscribe & Save, the Haribo Happy-Cola gummies were made in Spain and they had the flavor and texture of the original Harbio gummies available in Germany (5 stars). However, the bag I received in my most recent shipment shows that they were made in Turkey.....and the flavor and texture are both lacking (2 stars), likely due to the quality of ingredients used.So it saddens me to cancel my future Subscribe and Save orders of the Haribo Happy-Cola gummies. I wish there was a way to know the country of origin but it varies depending from which supplier Amazon is sourcing the product. :("
5,If you're into Gummi Cola...THIS IS WHAT TO GET!,"Warning though, not figure friendly, because once you get them it's hard to quit!My order came quickly and very fresh vs the overpriced candy stores where they're in a bin and you don't know how long they've been sitting there, or spending almost $2 for 5 ounces. Great deal right now, and with 2 bags, you get free shipping!"
4,Great Value!,Great Value compared to buying in the store!Only problem I have at times is that sometimes they are really dry and hard. Seems to be a problem resulting from the weather though.Overall still great!
5,Answer to a sweet tooth,This is my husband's most favorite candy. He was very excited to find it here and separated the 5 pound bag into smaller portion ziplock bags to satisfy his sweet tooth.
2,horrid hard slight cola flavor-lemon albanese bears are the best,"after trying different flavors of albaneese gummy bears --- The lemon Albaneese gummy bears have a distinct realistic lemon flavor and is not too sweet--these cola gummies are hard to chew on- the flavor is a slight cola flavor,the degree of sweetness is bland--if you like chewing and biting on a gummy for lenghty time that's somewhat bla this is a description of this product"
4,Good information,I found this helpful in getting to know some of the background of all those events in Scripture. Part of the confusion we have in understanding Scripture is the different customs and lifestyle then.
5,Awesome Performance!,"This magnificent & wonderfully detailed recording of Turangalila Symphony surpasses most of rivals including somehow over-rated Rattle's EMI recording. Previn captures the kaleidoscopic complexity of the music vividly as well as structural coherency of the whole. Slow movements are as evocative as can be. The finale is overwhelmingly powerful. As with his acclaimed EMI recording of Vingt regards, Michel Beroff is brilliant, displaying masculine yet sensitive pianism apt for Messian's music (You can enjoy this work as a piano concerto too, with such a awesome playing).Poulenc's two concertos are given equally impressive performances here, but the music itself does not interest me.Recording quality of all works included here is top class."
3,"Good, but not his best","This was one of the first Louis L'amour books I picked up and while it wasn't bad it just seemed to be lacking. The few other books of his I had read were GREAT and this one wasn't bad and was hard to put down but I think the main problem i had with it was the ending. It was just sort of anti-climatic. Now dont get me wrong, this in no was was a bad book and it was deffinetly worth reading, I just wouldn't read it as your first by Mr. L'amour."
3,Lime Green Multistrand Stretch Beaded Cuff,"My bracelet is not as attractive as the bracelet shown. The cut out on the buckle is rough and looks slightly flawed. I would not give this item (my particular one) as a gift, but I wore it to work today and got compliments."
4,"Fresco, vibrante y con bellisimas letras","Escuchar una canción implica involucrarse en un mundo de sentimientos y sensaciones. Este CD de Eleanor McEvoy tiene la virtud de transmitir honestidad. Bien cantado, bien contado y con arreglos musicales muy interesantes. Escuchar con atención ""Go now"", ""Music of it all"" y ""For You""."
3,"""make it lighter""","heavy set.buy if its must.only if matching serving casseroles needed, not otherwise recommended. lids heavy too."
4,'ELLO,"From that classic opening drum beat and ""'ello"" you're in prime rock'n'roll territory from the legendary solo artist and former singer of Mott The Hoople. Is there a better rock story in a song, from the slow build up to the onslaught of guitar from Mick Ronson...then the shredding solo. Classic. Yes that's by far the best track on the album, but the mix of midtempo rockers, mannered ballads (""Boy"") and earnest poetry (""Shades Off"")are all worth a listen...more variety and imagination than most of the homogenised pop on the radio today...AND you get 6 bonus tracks. Value! Off to re-read my copy of ""Diary of a Rock'n'Roll Star"" now..."
2,Eehhhhhh,"I bought this to help keep me from tearing/biting my nails, and I was kind of disappointed. It goes on just fine, and dries quickly, and at first it looked really nice. However, it also peels off really easily, leaving my nails looking worse than before."
5,5 stars for the cute daughter,"who has grown into a lovely young lady. fact is folks, a juggling book isn't realistic, as you need to see juggling to mimic and learn. though when I got this I was terrible, so it was helpful for a little while. truthfully, if you can, videos and dvds (dvds for loop factor) is the way to go so you can see it, SEE IT, over and over. a book forces you to visualize, whereas when you start juggling you just want to SEE IT, so you can mimic and learn, then get the form down and all that stuff, even the simple stuff like a 3 ball cascade/reverse, 4 ball fountain, you need to see these over and over. but the humor in the book is good, and the pictures are good, so that's why the 5 star, and the daughter...........sorry I dazed for a second there, for a true beginner (less than 3 months), it's worth it."
1,smh,"I finally bought the nintendo monopoly and the first thing I notice when I open the box is that the Master's Sword is labeled as Zelda's sword.Yes, it belong to Zelda's family but IT'S NOT ZELDA'S SWORD. IT'S LINK'S SWORD! I SWEAR!! If the company knows nothing about nintendo, why make it?! Seriously!!"
5,Monopoly,"As usual, you have monopoly, which, everyone knows, teaches one how to manage one's money wisely. This particular version is nintendo themed. I almost kept it for myself; the boys absolutely love it!"
2,THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT PICTURE!!,"It is not the seller's fault, but this version of the game has been discontinued and Amazon will not update the pictures!!! You will get the new monopoly where all the characters are pictured across the board the same size. Eeeergh Amazon!!"
4,board games,"My kids just love this game lots of fun gets them away from those video games, would reccomend to friends"
3,Nintendo Monopoly a bit of a dissapointment,"I bought this Monopoly back in 2009 for my boyfriend for Christmas. Being big Nintendo fans, we were both disappointed. It is essentially Monopoly with a few images from Nintendo. I was expecting them to go all out like they did with the Star Wars edition, but the houses, 'jail', 'free parking', and a few other squares remained the same as the original Monopoly. It's not a complete loss, I just feel it could have been so much more."
4,Monopoly,"Hello,I purchased Nintendo Monopoly, it was not exactly the one they had pictured, so that should be changed, although not a big importance in the end, it was actually the one we were after.. Not the Collectors edition.Good game, everything included, came on the date it said it would.Thankyou,Mitch Greenacre"
3,Nintendo Monopoly,"I was disappointed with the Nintendo Monopoly. Other monopoly games like the star wars one have different objects for the ""hotels"" and ""houses"". This game calls them ""power ups"" but they are just the same houses and hotels. Also the Railroad and the utilities aren't as Set off or different on the board. ( For the price I would think it would be better.)"
3,Pretty Good,"you can tell this set was thrown together.it covers different time periods of Miles&the Bands He had.you can hear the change in direction he was going with as well but this Album is more for your Collectors&for having it sakes than a Must have from Miles.""Tow Faced"" is probably the standout track for me here."
3,Glorified outtakes of varied worth,"Plenty of fluid ideas throughout on this early fusion release, but not much to gel all its fragmented interplay convincingly, WB nonetheless grows less indulgent and more relevant as it proceeds, ultimately proving an interesting bridge-builder for a blossoming electric experimental phase is this storied career."
1,Same as 5 disc collection,"This dvd is the same as vols.1 and 2 of the 5 disc Chaplin collection,of which never got more than one star rating.Don't bother with this one."
4,"Tips To Live Healthy, Wealthy, & Wise","This intriguing collection gathers wisdom from throughout the Western world: marriage counselors, the Bible (and Bible scholars), Poor Richard's Almanac, health professionals, moms, dads, kids, and grandparents. It is at times inspiring (interesting sections on when good virtues turn bad and on deadliest sins), at times impractical (one hour of reading for one hour of TV viewing? Binoculars made from toilet paper tubes as a kids' toy?) and even saccharine (We're supposed to use our TV time to snuggle and rub backs! I cringed when I read that line.) But then again, much here will admonish, console, and refresh and mostly, remind you of what we ought to do but often don't remember to. A good gift for those who enjoy Christy Lane, ""Touched By An Angel,"" and all wholesome things - or need to."
4,Great! except for 2 things,"This soundtrack captures the mood of the movie perfectly. The only 2 things I found wrong with it, was it doesn't have the original version of ""Gimme Some Lovin"" by the Spencer Davis Group & there wasn't any of the score tracks on the album. My favorite track is Joan Jett's ""Long Live The Night"" The rest of the artists do a great job as well. The cover of ""Knockin' on Heavens Door"" by G&R is awesome!"
2,Where's the score?,"While this CD is ""OK"" (not great by any standard), one question remains on everyone's mind.Where is the Score for this movie? The greatest disappointmen of Hans Zimmer's career is in not releasing the score to Days of Thunder."
4,Bring back memories of when Tom Cruise loved Nicole,"Great to listen to a soundtrack to the film that consumed my life in the early 90's,"
1,If you want the BGM...don't buy this CD,"This is the first time that I have been compelled to write a CD review. I was so, so dissapointed at this CD. Where is the great BGM that was in the film?! It is certainly not on this track list. This CD is an incomplete work. I advise that you save your money!"
4,Fit fine and seems to work,"Well, the front wheels of my excursion 4x4 haven't fallen off, so I gues these work."
3,"Nice Boleros, but..","Charlie Zaa did a good job on selecting the boleros to interpret. But perhaps he should have paid more attention to his interpreting. His interpretation is rather average, and to be honest (and not rude), I find his voice rather annoying (not to mention his artistic image). I think Los Tri-O have done a better job bringing back the beautiful music of Bolero. I gave it 3 stars for the selection of songs, which is very good."
3,Very good selection -- oldies but goodies.,"Great album for the bolero enthusiast. Great gift for mom and dad as well. Most listeners will recognize and enjoy the cuts on this second Zaa CD. Great CD, but I gave it a three because of Charlie's voice and his syncopated delivery. His voice reminds me of Julio Jaramillo (for those of you old enough to remember)."
4,Good review for microbiology,"This book covers a lot of subject area for microbiology. This is a very good reference book. I used this book for my undergraduate microbiology class along with the following:Microbiology Study Guide: Key Review Questions and AnswersISBN: 0971999635These 2 books helped me to get an ""A"" in my class. The second book which I also got on amazon.com is so specific to the type of questions I saw on my test. I was recommended the microbiology study guide by a friend in med school who used it for his USLME exam and found it quite helpful."
5,schaum's microbiology study guide,"taking online courses, this book helped with more information and quizzes at the end of each chapter."
5,New pull strap.,Strong material and overall length is perfect for a full size awning. A bit tough to get into the slot when replacing but works well.
4,As Advertised,What can I say? This came in the mail a few days after I ordered it and was exactly what I wanted. A replacement strap for my RV awning.
2,Love Potion: RED,"the boyfriend is *NOT* a fan. Personally, I find myself feeling ""candied"". And though it fades well enough, I'm not thrilled about the scent I have to deal with before arriving at the fade."
5,So Good it is Scary,TO SAY THIS ATTRACTS MALE INTEREST IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT! Dunno if it's the pheremones or just the yummy scent --But do not wear this stuff if you want to be alone!

I have bought other body washes that are too runny, which makes you use too much. I think this product helped my dry skin somewhat. I thought the scent was a little odd, something like Bubble Yum bubble gum, but it smelled okay on my skin. I probably wouldn't tell my friends and family to rush out and buy this product, but if they asked me if I've used it, I would say that I like it."
3,I found this product to be better than ...,"I found this product to be better than some, but not as good as others that I've tried. The product had a pleasing fragrance, but I didn't find it to be as moisturizing as I'd have liked it to be. In fact, by the end of the day, my skin felt a bit heavy and dry. I never have this feeling with my regular body wash. I will be sticking with my favorite (Oil of Olay) and wouldn't recommend this product to friends or family."
3,The Dove Ultra-Moisturizing Body Wash didn't seem any ...,"The Dove Ultra-Moisturizing Body Wash didn't seem any different from other body washes. There was nothing that really stood out about it. It smelled good and the scent lasted for a while. But it didn't make my skin feel any different. It felt good on my body after I lathered it on. I wouldn't really rave about this product to friends and family, but I wouldn't disapprove of it, either."
4,I really liked this body wash. It's thick ...,"I really liked this body wash. It's thick and creamy and has a very pleasant scent. The soap doesn't lather very much, but it's very creamy and delightful to bathe with. It did a good job of moisturizing my skin. I loved the way the pleasant fragrance lingered after showering, and I would buy this product again. However, the one drawback is that on certain sensitive areas, the soap did have a tendency to sting a little. Both my husband and I noticed this. But overall, it's a very pleasant soap and delivered what it promised."
5,Very happy,"It was exactly what I wanted. At first my shipment did not arrive when it was supposed to, and I found out that my order had ""fallen through the cracks"". The seller sent it to me promptly upon my email along with a nice note of apology. I'd do business with them any day!"
5,God's hand in history and the future events described,This Illustrated Great Controversy gives the reader insights into how God has been involved in Western Civilization history and will be involved in our near future. The illustrations add sound documentation to the wonderfully written text. A must read for serious Bible students.
5,It's about time!,"Just received an email from Amazon about this new DVD release, well it's about time! Western fans have patiently waited for the next season of Bonanza to be released on dvd, and glory be, we get a FULL season too boot. Yee Ha! What a great television series! If you like TV Westerns you will love this series! Bonanza fans: Encore Western Channel will be airing Bonanza; The Lost Episodes, in July 2012. This is a must see for all true fans."
5,Bonanza DVD,"Bonanza was a sequel series in South Africa broadcasted by the then SABC in the late 70s. it was usualy a Saturday evening treat and we as a family were looking forward every week to another episode.It normally involved my late parents, my wife, my brother and his wife.We could associate ourselves with the family values of the Carter family and the stories were always good fun and moralistic.I have bought all the series DVDs now and watches an episode with my wife and my brother's youngest son as part of Saturday night entertainment.I am not hooked on TV and use it sparingly-but nice DVD's like Bonanza is something to have as a collection and if I still a few years left, I will again later on watch them again.It remains a challenge for contemporary movie makers to write scripts with equal moral values without swear words and obscene incidents.Sad that none of the Bonanza people are alive anymore. They left a legacy which can still provide sound entertainment to may people."
5,Bonanza Season 3,"I now own all 3 seasons that have been released. I pre-ordered Season 4 this week. I received Season 3 this week and am so impressed with the quality and the content. The picture is so sharp and clear. I noticed little details that I hadn't noticed in watching the show on air. The extras are pictures and interviews never heard or seen other places. Whether you are already a fan or new to the show, these dvds are excellent. I look forward to more to come. I am so glad to see them being released on a quicker time table now!!!!"
2,Not Great,"The ""airtight"" seal is not so airtight. When fully latched you can move the lid around and even lift it a little. The latch doesn't even hold tightly, just tipping the jar sideways releases it. So if you are looking for an airtight canister to hold your coffee, this isn't it."
2,ok book,Not as good as I expected. book came in perfect condition. Seller is good. But book was not as good as I expected.
5,Wonderful book,"Very interesting look at another culture through the eyes of children who are experiencing great suffering. However, the book is inspiring and hopeful throughout."
2,Boring...,"If you are a normal person, you find find this to be a slow and boring book. Yes, it deals with real issues, but who cares. I feel sorry for the characters, but it's not like you can do anything in REAL LIFE."
5,PURE BLISS,Julie Andrews at her very best. I was lucky enough to see her performing this album live at the Royal Albert Hall with Andre Previn and the LSO. It was pure bliss and afterwards the street outside the stage door was packed with hundreds of fans all singing songs she had made world famous from those blockbusters Mary Poppins and The Sound of Music. It was quite a night and it's so good to see that it's now on CD. A great buy.
4,Great Debut,"Wow. This girl has some voice! The songs are catchy, lyrics are inspiring, and her voice is near-perfect. In a few years, she could just be the next Christina Aguilera in the U.S. ;) Bottom Line: Great voice, good songs, second CD should be better."
4,Good but not definitive,"Muti is better known for his conducting of italian opera, which is music in a lighter vein. His qualities are better suited to the symphony no. 1, to which he imparts remarkable momentum and ease of flow, especially in the last movement. In the fifth, however, which requires a more dramatic approach, he does a bit of smoothing over some key emotional points in the first movement. The second and third movements are nicely done, however, and the finale is just terrific. I don't think I've heard a reading of this fourth movement more full of joy and excitement. The Philadelphia Orchestra is good, although one could expect more from the brass section. The EMI recording is also good, although it doesn't give the bass enough emphasis."
1,Dr. Scholl's Shout Review - Avoid,"I just bought these sandals. I was disappointed in how cheap they look in person. Had I looked at them in a store I might have paid $15. Also, while they feel comfortable to step into - the patent ""leather"" cut my feet after a few minutes of walking. In addition, the cross strap ""bled"" black color and particles? on my feet. Avoid."
3,This soap does exactly as it claims -- ...,"This soap does exactly as it claims -- it left my skin feeling soft and moisturized without the feeling of a soapy residue. However, it doesn't smell good -- it has a very strong soapy smell. It somehow doesn't smell clean and it's unpleasant, as it lingers on the skin. Even though this product works very well, its odor left me feeling like I'd used an inferior product."
3,"The product is nice, but it doesn't lather ...","The product is nice, but it doesn't lather all that readily. The scent is pleasant enough, though I wouldn't mind the fragrance being stronger. Its best feature is that it does seem to leave my skin softer than other soaps."
3,"It could be better, but it's good","It's a good book, but I thought it was better, because there isn't much project's description, but there's a lot of pictures"
2,Another dreadful transcript of a Fabulous book,"I should have read the reviews first! In my enthusiasm of finding the Golden Torc series on Kindle, I went ahead and bought them all at once.The first 2 books were marred by occasional transcription errors, but not so many as to spoil the experience. Not so with the 3rd and 4th.In have really tried to get over the constant misspellings created by a very poor OCR product, and without any perceptible quality control, but when they are so frequent and of core words too, it's impossible.This has detracted to such an extent that the joy of re-reading a much loved classic in Kindle format has become an irritant.Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to go on without rectification. Others have previously commented on this and you have done nothing about it. Do you actually read the product reviews?Bottom line, overpriced for such shoddy quality. Please sort it out."
3,Pliocene Exile -- A review,"I read the series on recommendation of a friend, who was intrigued by it. I have about 1/2 of volume 4 to go. I found that the story was not a nail biter and the presentation suffered from horrible editing. It appears that the books were scanned in but never proofread. The story has too many characters without any real threads to hang on to."
2,too time consuming,"Really not worth the time it takes. I play Mexican Train and thought this would help organize the hand. Not so, after two hands I put them aside and went back to old method on the table. Dominoes are too close to each other and only on one level."
1,Don't Buy,I have purchased other domino trays from other manufacturers and this brand is not even functional. Should be taken off the market.
3,Domino Tray,These trays are ideal for playing Domino games such as Chickenfoot and Train however the wood has a fishy smell to it that is distracting. I have kept them outside in the sunshine to help eliminate the odor but that hasn't worked so yesterday I bought some spray lacquer and am trying that. I can tolerate the smell of lacquer better than the odor of dead fish!
2,Domino Trays,"I ordered too many trays, but the trays worked out well, and will used the extra ones I bought for another gift for another grand daughter."
3,Great accessory,The wooden racks are a wonderful accessory to the Mexican Train Dominoes game. They enable you to keep you tiles in front of you and give you the ability to lay out your moves in advance. Much better than trying to do this on the table surface. Wish somebody would include them in the game.
3,Not Bad,These are ok but we found that the tiles are a little too close together to be able to see the dots (or numbers) on the tiles. My friend used one as a model and made me a new set slightly wider which works great.
3,What?,"I'm afraid to report that SYR3 isn't nearly as accessible as the previous two editions. However, there are some serious sounds that evoke B Horror films and Sci-Fi from the 50s. Blirps and whizzes. But at times, it sounds like Indian raga music.Swinging from camp to transcendental. How sublime!This is definitely music that you would want to play loud to get some attention."
3,What A Loooooooooong Night!,"This whole story happened just in one night. A group of teenagers go to Fear Island to throw a party for Cindy, one of their friends, because it was her bithday. Soon she gets murdered in the island. Everyone is so scared. I don't recommend this book, but you can go ahead and read it if you want to."
3,"It would never stop, you couldn't put the book down!",R.L. Stine has a very good imagination for these kind of books. Not like other writers he has breathtaking things going on at once which makes you not put the book down!
1,"ATTENTION, ATTENTION! THIS IS THE WORST BOOK EVER!","Disregard all other reveiws except this one! This book is a total stretch! You are led to believe one killer did it, then another, then you found out it is the same person you started with! I was terribly dissapointed at the ending. What guy in his right mind would plant evidence on himself/herself to throw suspicion to someone else. This book is not worthy of your time, it is not worthy of your money, to say the honest truth this book is not worthy of the sugar-coated review I'm giving it now! Don't buy this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you want a good, suspenceful read, try TRUTH OR DARE. You won't be able to put it down and it is much less amature than this book."
2,Stine must have pumped this out in 90 minutes,"I'm usually a fan of these Point thrillers, even though i'm probably too old for them now (i'm 20, but they were a big part of my childhood!). ALL NIGHT PARTY was a huge disappointment, I knew who the killer was going to be inside the first couple of pages, from then on nothing much happened. Of course, if I was half my age (i.e. the intended audience), I may have enjoyed it, so I'm probably just a whinging grizzly-guts. Go read HIT AND RUN instead. Or THE FUN-HOUSE - I lent that to somebody nine years ago and still haven't got it back..."
3,pretty good,"I have read as much as I could of R.L. Stine's books as I could since goosebumps one. Most I couldn't wait to show my friends. This one I left on my shelf and was hisitant to tell my friends about it.R.L. I know you can do 10x's better than this. I mean is this logical, A girl turns 17 and on her birthday she gets murderd? Don't get me wrong R.L. Stine ROCKS but this wasn't one of his best!"
3,Eh...,It was an okay book. About a bunch of teens having a birthday party on a remote island. Most people leave the house then when returning one girl finds a surprize in the kitchen. The main problem in this book was that R.L. Stine tried to put too much suspense in it and it sort of gets old. just buy a used copy for a penny for reading when you have nothing else to do. I reccomend that you get the babysitter 1 by R.L. It's one of my favorites!
4,Party party,On Cindy's birthday her friends throw her a surprise party on Fear Island. It should've been great except that there's a madman loose on the island who crashes the party.Good as usual from Stine.
4,This was a really good book,All Night Party was a really good. The action began as soon as the story started and in my opinion that's a plus. I never got bored reading this book and the ending was totally unexpected. I can usually guess who the killer is but not this time. The characters were okay but not as likeable as some of R.L. Stine's other works.I definitely would recommend this book. Especially to anyone who likes mysteries. I finished this book in about 2 - 3 hours.
1,Horrible.,"Dont waste your time. Horrible graphics, lousy interface, hard to understand. DONT buy this. Try ANY other game. Bought this game because its was ""cheap"" and seamed like a nice topic, i really regret wasting my hard earned money."
4,Its a Fair View,"The book provides historical background as well as the context to understand Islamic Politics. It begins with how the early Muslims use their faith to shape Islamic Ideology for both state and society. The book also discusses the rise of Islam, the many empires that flourished and as well as declined. Lastly, The book nicely make its way out by talking about the modern fundamentalism. This book doesnt really convince one to take sides or anything like that. It just sheds a perspective on the basic timeline of Islamic Politics. One could grasp a scope on how much the Muslims deviates in modern times against the original Islamic societal principles and why so this happened."
1,Huge disappointment,"I have to agree with the disappointed fan below -- I'm greatly disappointed with this CD. If you're looking for catchy Cracker tunes like what you'll find on all their other CDs, this is the wrong place to look. For me, a good Cracker CD is one that has a couple of immediately catchy songs and then others that grow on you with repeated listens -- Forever was a good example. So was Gentleman's Blues. So was everything they've done, until now. What happened? In these days of dying rock stations I thought I could count on Cracker, but I guess I'll have to stick with their previous releases."
4,Return to Rock by Cracker,"Cracker's 7th studio release 2006's ""Greenland"", is the follow up to the country themed album ""Country-sides"". Cracker returned to the rock they did on ""Forever"". The highlights include: ""Something You Ain't Got"", ""Where Have Those Days Gone"", ""Fluffy Lucy"", ""The Riverside"" one of there best!, ""Night Falls"" and ""Better Times Are Coming Our Way"". The band: David Lowery, Johnny Hickman, Frank Funaro, Kenny Margolis and Victor Krummenacher."
4,Odd in the best sense of the word,"""The Dybbuk"" is a 1937 Polish film by Michael Waszynski, more or less loosely based on the eponymous play by S. Ansky. Inspired by apocryphal Jewish myth, it tells the story of a spurned lover who comes back from the dead as a spirit (a dybbuk) to possess the girl he loved. Tremendously stylized acting (that some might see as bad), camp in spite of itself, and very very odd, in the best sense of the word. It speaks volumes about gender."
4,Harmonica & Jazz?,"I have too admit I am not a jazz harmonica fan. Yes,I've heard Toots, but he does'nt really do it for me. So you can imagine my surprise when I found myself drawn to the sounds of Hendrick Meurkens! The sound is relaxed and sophisticated. He shares ample space with sax man Eric Alexander, and a wonderful rhythm section. Harmonica & Jazz? Well I have too admit that I have practically worn this CD out in the first two months of ownership. If you like Hardbop & Cool Jazz, buy this! It's a ""10""..."
4,LIBERATE!,"This is one helluva comp. An incredibly accurate reissue of the comp with crass, conflict, icons of filth, etc. BUY it if you wan't to live."
1,You get what you pay for,I needed just a little light to assist on some tight shots. I could have trained a monkey to sit on top of my camcorder with a lighter and it would have been brighter than this thing. Spend the extra money on something else. I heard the Sunpak was good.
3,Great little light,This is a great little light if you don't want to spend a lot of money for the one or two instances when you need to shoot in the dark.
4,A Great Movie For Horror Lovers,"This Movie Is Great! Both Of Them. I Like Both Of Them. I Thing The People Who Like ""Sometimes They Come Back"" And ""Sometimes They Come Back Again"" Should Try ""Sometimes They Come Back For More"""
4,Sometimes They Come Back/Sometimes The Come Back Again,"I found this double feature dvd sealed at a truck station last week. I had the original on dvd by mgm. I love widescreen, but for $7.99 it was a steal. Yeah the second one is cheesy and has satanic overtones, but it's still watchable. The first will always have a warm place in my heart, but the sequel is just fun to watch and laugh at. It's strange I found the dbl feature dvd. The store had like 5 left. Guess im going to sell them. Not for $117.00. I beleive in karma, so they will be affordable."
1,False Advertisement,"I purchased this product thinking it was both movies on one DVD but when it arrived in the mail it was only ""Sometimes They Come Back."" I reordered the item thinking it was a mistake with shipping and received the same item again. This was the first time I've ever been through something like this with a Amazon purchase and I'm very DISAPPOINTED!"
1,disappointed,"The story was a ""cartoon"" with a narrator and a person ""signing"" for those with hearing difficulties. Both detracted from the story and seemed to overpower it. There was no oppportunityFive Little Monkeys Jumping on the Bed... and More Favorite Children's Stories (Scholastic Storybook Treasures)to show or nor show the ""signing."" If I knew what the video was like, I never would have purchased it for my grandaughter."
2,Not like the rest of the series!,"We own many of the Scholastic Video series DVDs and really enjoy them. This one is geared toward hearing impaired children or someone learning sign language. While I think this is great for hearing impaired children who can not yet read, if you are thinking you'd like to add to your library with a few more stories you don't have yet, you might reconsider this one. The people doing the sign language are right in the middle of the screen in front of the pictures and are quite distracting from the story. We love these stories and were disappointed that it was not very enjoyable to watch in this format. Too bad they don't make another series with all of these done for hearing impaired children and another done the original way. The product has a sign language icon but on the cover but be warned it isn't an option to toggle off and it's very intrusive to the story being told."
5,Get your kicks too!,"This book has become my introduction to the Mother Road legacy and it was unforgettable experience! Perhaps, its most thrilling feature is in a ""stereoscopic"" layout of the pages where vintage and contemporary photos neighbor ""native"" food receipes and period vehicles. Now that I have sensed ambience of the past and have get my kicks I can readily recommend reading this book before, during and after a real trip."
3,The bubbles in this bubble bath were quite ...,"The bubbles in this bubble bath were quite adequate. They were thick and long lasting. The scent was appealing. However, I would've preferred the scent to be stronger especially after being poured into the tub. It smelled very nicely in the bottle, but was undetectable in the bath."
4,Space Oldie but Goodie,"One of the old black & white (converted to color acceptably) space movies that was so popular. The spaceships may look old-fasioned by todays standards but back then, they looked High-Tech! This is a movie that can be enjoyed for its own sake & doesn't need to be a deep/meaningful movie that takes a lot of thought to understand."
1,Lost in space (and not worth recovering),"2001: A Space Odessey it's not. More like a poor man's Twilight Zone episode on valium. I saw the MST3k version of this formulaic space dud and if it weren't for the bots' jokes, this movie would make you cry. Tepid, mundane and bland--and that's just the actors. The cheesy effects are only matched by the fact that the whole thing must have been filmed in the director's basement on a rainy day. The women are from a dated Max Factor ad, the aliens speak English better than an NYU grad and the plot fell and couldn't get up. For a good chuckle, though, check out the chest on our manly, pre-Capt. Kirk hero, Frank Chapman."
2,SCHLOCK MEETS CAMP,"The plot involves something about astronaut Dean Fredericks landing on an asteroid where he's shrunk down to miniature size by a race of miniature people who ... Oh, forget it. This minor curiosity from the early 60's combines the schlocky production values of Grade-Z sci-fi films from the 50's with a bit of the campy excess found in the Saturday-matinee serials of the 1930's. The result is watchable but not especially fun.Dean Fredericks (better known for his short-lived ""Steve Canyon"" series on TV) is stiff and humorless as the astronaut but he has the right looks and he gets the opportunity to do an extended bare-chest scene. (If you can't act, flex.)An old, tired, and almost-pathetic Francis X. Bushman pops up in a small part. It's sad to see ""Messala"" wearing such a tatty costume in such a low-budget movie."
1,Nah.,Phantom Planet bills itself as an unintentional comic cheeseball on the level of a 50's cult classic- It isn't; it's rather and early to mid-60's snooze-athon. The haircuts are maddening and the babes aren't cute. Resist the Phantom Planet. And remember I warned you.
2,Scared Little Guy,"I saw this movie when it first came out, (I was six or seven years old). It scared me pretty good, I couldn't walk down darkened hallways or into dark rooms. My older brother (by almost four years) however, exploited these conditions fairly well, and succeeded in terrorizing me even further, every chance that he got.Without a doubt, this movie is hokey by today's standards. But it was well worth the purchase price to relive an influential fraction of my childhood."
4,Really great Bad Sci-Fi,"This movie is an all-time classic. It is one of those movies that are so bad they hysterical. Watch for ""The Prisoner"" who is in a cage in the basement. He is the prototype for ""Gromet"" in the Wallace and Gromet movies - something never before discovered and a great trivia question."
3,Late Night fun as a kid,This film is no classic but it is a fun one i remember as a kid. I saw it late night of course and enjoyed it then and i have seen it since and realize that you should take it as it is and not look for extreme quality acting but if you are a sci fi fan and enjoy old flicks then you will have fun with this one. Break out the popcorn and gather the kids for a good viewing.
3,Tedious,"I'm a SLP major and have read a few of Robert Owens's books. They are all drawn out and tedious to read. Obviously, it's an educational book, so I'm not expecting to be exciting. But, he could have made the book more concise and easy to read.I don't experience this problem with other authors either."
2,Not good,"20 authors, 20 styles, too little editing, and not a single map. Not one. This volume is too long and arbitrarily detailed for a casual reader, and not scholarly enough for a nonspecialist academic in need of a fix for a class."
2,Not a Corelli fan and even less now after hearing these CDs.,"Corelli's voice was quite large,but I'm not very sure about it's beauty.He is much better in operas,but on these discs,I find his singing annoying.To the reviewer who wrote the Major Disappointment review and included Di Stefano in those not having a beautiful voice,I'd have to say that you obviously don't know what you're talking about.Music fan from New Jersey."
2,I definitely wouldn't buy this product or recommend ...,"I definitely wouldn't buy this product or recommend it to my friends or family. The scent is too harsh. Also, it made my skin feel very dry. The lather was fair, but I definitely like the rich moisturizing Dove or Caress body wash. The price is entirely too much. You can get a better body wash for only a few cents more."
4,Inspiring,"This book gives a basic overview of beauty as it pertains to every age group from 20's up, as well as specific situations such as dealing with cancer, job interviews, special events, pregnancy and the like. The highlights of the book are the stories of women who radiate beauty despite the fact they are approaching 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or even 102. The book skims over actually applying and using makeup, and some readers might findBobbi Brown Makeup Manual: For Everyone from Beginner to Proa better choice for learning how to apply and use makeup. Overall this book is highly specific to women's lives and routines, and the information in it is very good."
1,Useless. Did Bobbi Brown really write this?,"My daughter ordered this book and has these comments:This book attempts to cover each age group in the population, suggesting targeted beauty, well-being, and health tips. It fails miserably, because it is not accessible for most readers, who might get a single page devoted to them personally. The tips are mostly common sense (exercise, eat right, etc.), and while this book tries to be holistic in it's scope, we all know we should take care of our bones and relax...it's nothing new or anything to get excited about. It is a bare-bones collection of photos of people who could walk the runway at any age, and tips that read more like the sugeon general's recommendations, and less like a true beauty insider's secrets. Really no practical info here, I expected more from a makeup guru like Bobbi Brown. Did she even have any part in this book's production? Seems like it could have been written by anyone...and had her name slapped on to sell more copies."
2,Not very helpful,"I was hoping that this book might give me tips on how to apply makeup, what would work best for my face shape, lip shape, eye size, skin color, etc. But it was too general in my opinion. I haven't found any tips that I have carried with me. So I'm still looking for a good book on how to apply makeup!"
4,"Things you know, plus some you don't","I had this book for a few weeks before I picked it up to read. I was pleasantly surprised. Going in, I felt as if I knew everything there was to know about makeup already. Years of reading fashion magazines and getting makeovers had put me into a comfortable groove. Yet Bobbi did teach me a few new tricks with the tips she suggests in this book. I whizzed through it in one evening and found it to be an easy read. I think the biggest thing women forget is that if they're 40 and still treating their face as if they're 30, they're not doing themselves any favors. Bobbi reminds us of the essentials we need to know at each age. Sure, there are some unnecessary bits in the book that I already knew. But maybe the next woman won't know those things already. Everyone can just pull from it what they need."
2,"Basically A Rehash Of ""Bobbi Brown Beauty""","I am definitely an admirer of Bobbi Brown, whose lovely makeup designs can actually be worn by real women in real life. Her book ""Bobbi Brown Beauty"" is one of my favorites. However, much of the advice in that book is repeated in this one. There are new features in this book; for instance, a section on makeup for cancer patients and sections on makeup to wear for each decade of your life. However, about seventy percent of the advice in this book was dealt with in the previous publication. I would only purchase this book at a bargain price."
2,Nothing you haven't read before,"I'm a makeup junkie, so I eagerly awaited this book. If you have other makeup books, especially those by people like Kevyn Aucoin, and her earlier work ""Bobbi Brown Beauty"", save your money. It is just a feel good about being a woman book, not a makeup book. The only reason I gave this book two stars is that right in the beginning a compare/contrast section shows how photo retouching remarkably alters photos. That section should be recommended reading for all persons reviewing fashion magazines."
3,"Average ""Caper"" Novel","William Blankenship's ""The Leavenworth Irregulars"" is a caper novel with a difference. Good idea, but not handled well.The ""caper"" is an army payroll heist from Fort Riley by three ex-GIs who met in the army prison at Fort Leavenworth. The heist is well thought-out and well executed, with no one getting hurt and the gang getting away cleanly.The kicker is that a couple of Fort Riley soldiers figure out who did the heist and determine to recover the money for themselves. The tone changes from cleverness to brutality as these bad guys pursue the good thieves.Plot is above average for the heist; so-so for the hijacking of the loot. Characters are pretty much cardboard. Action scenes are not bad but predictable.If this were a movie, I'd say it was ""made for TV"". Not bad, somewhat entertaining, but not satisying."
2,pee wee's first major dissapointment,"paul reubens character was one of the greatest comedic events of our time.. From the early variety show, to the playhouse, to the big adventure - pee wee could not lose.. I remember seeing big top pee wee in the theatre - and feeling very dissapointed with a movie that was just not very fun or interesting.. Whereas 'pee wee's big adventure' explored more of pee wees quirkiness (remember the scene with the tape in the bathroom) 'big top pee wee' tried to take the character move him to a different setting and make a sort of romantic comedy.. This is probably where it all falls apart.. pee wee should not be a romantic figure - he is the opposite.. he is best when he remains a sort of neuter or man child.. the second romance enters the picture.. pee wee loses all of his charm and comedy.. there are a few funny moments in big top pee wee but on the whole it falls flat."
2,Big Flop Pee Wee,"I don't like to say it as a major Pee Wee fan, but this movie can get as low as the ground Pee Wee walks on. It has too much kissing, and even though it starts out all right, it starts to get weird and boring. The tricks are not at all mysterious, and I have come to expect a lot more from Pee Wee. It has a couple tiny laughs, but they don't last long. I don't think this movie was one fifth as good as the other, 'Pee Wee's Big Adventure'."
5,no issues...,Book was receive in expected condition as agreed upon. And it made a good gift! All is good. :-)
2,Watch Pee Wee's Big Adventure instead,I remember watching this when it first came out and I was around 12 or 13. It was crummy then and it's crummy now. I've read some of Paul Reuben's interviews and even HE said he wasn't too happy with it. Pee Wee's Big Adventure is leaps and bounds better than Big Top
2,It is stupit but watchable,I have to agree this movie is pretty bad but yet again you can watch it. The kids might get a kick out of it but some will and some won't. I saw this movie in 1988 in the theater and I liked it then but I know my parents hated it by the looks on their faces. But as you grow up and get a chance to view this movie you really look at how rediculous this movie really is now all I am interested at looking at it is that chick named Gina in it WOW! But other than looking at some of the attractive circus women in this film it's pretty darn sorry.
5,big top pee wee,"got my dvd very quick, and the dvd works great. my grandkids are very happy with this dvd. thank you."
1,Yuck!,Pee-Wee's Big Adventure is a great movie and totally hilariously funny but this sequel Big Top Pee-Wee is horrible. It's not funny and it stinks like a pile of dirty diapers!
2,Not for kids,I watched Big Top for the fist time since childhood and I really don't think it's apporprate for young folk. It wasn't half as good as Big Adventure.
2,Big Top Pee-Wee,"The movie was not new. It had an extremely faded cover, labels from another location, and the tape was wrinkled. I was very disappointed."
3,Old time favorite,My daughter remember watching Pee Wee on TV so to see him again is good. She really enjoys watching movies.
1,DANGER DANGER!!!,"WARNING! This is the worst movie I ever saw in my childhood...the worst of the worst was that Pee Wee falls in love with this acrobat Gina, thus cheating on his fiancee Winnie(I mean c'mon, disliking egg sandwiches is a real excuse for a breakup??? Yea I know the film was meant to be funny, but I don't have the heart to appreciate humor that involves infidelity and sheer cowardice). Pee Wee was supposed to be fun and childlike, like he was in ""Big Adventure"", but he acted like some other Joe Schmo in this sequel. Most sequels bomb, but this one bombed the size of an atomic bomb. And untimently at the end, ends up with Gina??...ugh what lunecy, what a pervert. I have a fiancee and looking forward to a happy marriage and I will never cheat on her.Anywho, this is advice to anybody who is deciding on what movie to watch when browsing in the 80's comedy section and finds this movie on the rack. Unfunny!! Don't spend a penny on!"
1,HORRIBLE TRANSACTION! BUYERS BEWARE,Did not even receive the product that I purchased. I will be filing a claim with Amazon for sure
2,Not Funny,"This movie is not as funny as Pee-wee's Big Adventure. This movie should have more funny parts and less romance. When I saw this movie, I didn't like it. Big Top Pee-wee should have been more like Pee-wee's Big Adventure and I think it should of had comedy material instead of romance material. THIS MOVIE IS NOT GOOD AND NOT FUNNY AT ALL."
1,It's a stupid movie!,Nothing great about this sequel. At least the girl he falls for is hot. I like that girl Gina but this movie is so ridiculous. I don't know what's up with the good reviews. Tim Burton didn't direct this one. At least Pee-wee Herman writes the script which is good but Pee-wee's Big Adventure is way better than Big Top Pee-wee. I mean come on Big Top Pee-wee fails. Stick with Pee-wee's Big Adventure.
1,please stand by,"Dear Amazon.ComMy dad saw this movie when it came out and didn't like it because ofall the romance in this movie infact I am working on a looney tunes mini-movie for Warner bros. (the people who made Big Adventure which my dad like better) and I am not putting the part with the kiss into my movie and what would the animated me think about this anyways as the animated me said in my mini-movie ""the original release [of big adventure] was a classic"" in ways big adventure is considered as classic moviemaking but this was notsigned Michael E. Jones"
3,Wonderful story,The story is nice but the acting...well let's just say 5 years old can do better than that. and again I blame it all at the director...did you take some acting class before ?? or may be he didn't pass cinematography school.
4,Sexy fun Independant Film,I think it's great that many studios are supporting the gay community by releasing independant titles. I think this movie is super sexy and fun!
5,Mentadent Advanced Whitening....not.,"Although I ordered this product, I was sent the Mentadent with baking soda instead. I don't really care. I've used Mentadent for years and like it very much, although this is the first time I've had this variety. I like it, too. The toothpaste is very good, IMO, however what I really love is the delivery system. If I could buy refillable dispensers like this I certainly would. Since I've been unable to buy any Mentadent toothpaste locally, I'm pleased to have found some on Amazon."
4,"Cute, but use sealant!","I bought this table for my 2 year old daughter and love the look of it. It is a little bulky and takes up quite a bit of room but it was easy to put together and is the right size for a young child. The only issue I have had is that the paint scratches/chips easily, even without rough play. For example, a plastic horse has left black hoof marks on the top that cannot be removed, and red play-dough stains it and is hard to clean off without removing paint. I wish I had known this when I bought it because we would have used some sort of a sealant on the paint to avoid this."
5,Really Happy with this table,"We looked for a long time to find a table for our daughter's room that would be a functional yet ""stylish"" addition to her room. We didn't want Dora or Disney Princess tables as that didn't match the rest of the furniture in her room. This table is perfect and I love the little bit of extra storage that the bins give you. She thinks she is ""so big"" now with her own table and chairs. Would highly recommend this!"
2,KidKraft Kwality,"I spelled it wrong for a reason. Ordered this table for my daughter at their highly above market price because I wanted the specific color combination. It arrived just fine. The problem was the lack of quality control or any oversight I guess. The hearts cut into he chair backs were lopsided on one chair and in the other there was a large divot cut out like the router/jigsaw skipped and flew. They just painted over this and sent it out. The hardware to attack the table-top to the base is sub-standard metal that was bent in shipment and i was able to bend back with just my hands. The holes drilled never aligned to the hardware or matching pieces. Is it attractive, yea ideally, and the idea is wonderful, but I shouldn't have had to spend a day woodworking and painting to correct their mistakes for such an over priced item."
4,Kidkraft Hear Table and Chair Set,"This is a very cute little table and chairs. My four year old granddaughter likes it very much. It appears to be sturdy enough to last for a few years. Shipping was expensive, almost $[...], that's the only problem I had with the table set. Shipping cost was almost as much as the table set."
4,Cute and Fun,"I had just purchased a new bed for my 2 year old granddaughter and felt we needed a table for her to play on. This table and chairs are perfect and as cute as can be. They may be just a little premature for my granddaughter as she is more likely to want to stand on the table than to work on it, but, hopefully, it will last for awhile. The cute storage compartments are also great, but not as much for a two-year old who takes things out of them and doesn't put them back. Not only do I have problems with the 2 year old, but also I have problems with the puppy who does the same thing. My ADHD grandson has also already broken one of the chairs, but I think with normal wear and tear it would have held up well.I'm glad I got this really cute ensemble, but I do realize my granddaughter won't appreciate it as much until she is possibly another year older."
5,Toddler table fun,I bought this for my 18 month old daughter. She is able to get in and out of the chairs all by herself and loves sitting at the table and coloring. The chairs are very sturdy - enough for an adult to sit on - and the table cleans really easily. A Mr. Clean magic eraser wipes crayons off the table top without much effort. This was well worth the money and I think we will have it for years to come.
2,Missing Parts,I purchased this from amazon for my girls...delivery was fast but when I went to put it together there was no hardware in the box...I called Kidcraft and they sent me the missing hardware.... Just beware if you buy this you may have to wait for parts!!
5,Great Table and Chairs,"THis table and chairs took about 2 hours to assemble, but the directions were fairly easy to understand. The table and chairs appear to be very good quality and sturdy. The bins are nice for extra storage. Our daughter-in-law picked it out and we were very happy with all aspects of it."
3,Marks on tabletop,"This product is nice and sturdy, my only complaint is with the table top - the first one had all these little brown marks on it, so we requested another one. The second one they sent also had brown marks on it. I gave up at that point."
1,What a big waste of money and false advertising on the box.,"This software proved to be worthless. There are no lessons as mentioned on the box. It is nothing but 10 question quizzes. Giving it 1 star is generous. More time went into creating the lies on the box than into the software. Can not believe they have ""#1 best selling educational suite"" on the box."
3,"Mild not-at-all fishy, slightly sweet","I like a strong mustard-y sardine and these are mild, mellow, perfect with sweet onion and sharp pickles. Not my favorite sardine, yet, quite a nice meal for the family."
4,Yikes!,"I actually ""ghost wrote"" about half of this book! I didn't keep a copy for myself, and just on a whim I typed the title into Google today and discovered two copies available.I've ordered one of them.Small WorldSB (I didn't think it would be fair for me to rate the book but the software wouldn't let me post without doing so)"
3,If I was a teenager again.....,"I liked it..well kinda. I guess I was expecting an adult romance and it wasn't. I recently read a review in a magazine that placed it with adult paranormal reviews. I love hidden gems in this genre! This is one, but for the 13-20 set.I realy liked the voice of the author. She is very discrpive and often I found I could ""see"" what she wanted me to see. However the Romeo is almost predictable in his thoughts, words, and deeds. I like my paranormals to keep me guessing..at least a little while..If I was a younger reader I would love this book!"
5,Eye-opening series on lawyers and law school,"It's hard to review an achievement such as Lawrence Velvel's tetrology ""Thine Alabaster Cities Gleam"" but suffice it to say, the struggles to create a law school""for the people"" are portrayed in these books in exquisite detail.The accounts are fictionalized, for obvious reasons, but as fiction, this is of course a flop--it's not even a roman a clef. This is a documentation of political infighting, conflicting goals, treachery and unbridled power-grabbing. As a depiction of American politics at any level, corporate, governmental or scholastic, it's a winner. You really have to read the entire series to get the full impact, so I won't review each individually. If you have been to law school, deal with lawyers or professors or if you want insight into political scheming, this is a text of huge merit."
3,So-So,"The other books in this awesome series soar above this one, mainly because, if you have nothing in common with this sligthly morbid girl, you can't appreciate her story. There's hardly any dialogue and too many flashbacks to make it interesting. However, if you read the rest of the series, this is a good one to read, too, because you'll understand Morgan better in the other books."
2,Very Realistic.,"I hated this book. First, it wasn't all that interesting, and second of all, it was really boring for me though. This wasn't the best book Rachel Vail has ever written."
5,Both Enjoyable and Thorough,"You simply cannot choose a better overview of intelligent agent modeling. Wooldridge brings the reader from an extremely non-threatening, non-technical treatment of the basics to formal modeling of individual agent properties and multi-agent interaction using (essentially) constructions of formal logic.This book is clearly intended to communicate a particular theory in a very effective manner. However, it does not (nor does it pretend to) provide a path to implementing any of the theory, so dilettantes beware."
5,Perfect for energing readers,"My son just started 1st grade. He was just starting to read at the end of Kindergarten. Over the summer we worked on trying to read more and now, this book (Fat Cat on a Mat) is perfect level for him. It isn't too hard - and not too easy either. He gains confidence in his ability to read when he reads this book. The words are written in simple sentence structure for emerging readers. I am getting more of these to encourage him to keep reading!"
3,"An old book, but still useful","Influence of Sea Power may be old, and written in the nineteenth century, but it is still a useful book. Mahan outlines six principles of what makes a strong seapower: geographic position; physical features; territorial extent; population size and character; and finally, the government's policy.The basic strategic principles are still valid: the seapower has the ability to drive his enemies flag from the ocean, and oceanic wars are won by decisive battles between capital ships at sea.But Mahan also warned his readers that seapower was not the only driving force behind historical events; it was but one element. An aspect of Mahan's work that is often forgotten by his extremist followers.Mahan's work covers the period in good detail, and is a must read for anyone starting out in naval history. But one must remember, it is a history, and Mahan was looking to the past for laws of human behavior; a popular style of history in the late-nineteenth century."
1,Serious Errors in Printing,"Got a copy of this for Christmas. This reprint is full of formatting and content errors. Chapters begin in the middle of a sentence. Strings of unformatted characters are randomly inserted. A very sloppy printing job, look elsewhere for this classic."
3,"A Good Thesis, but Unproven","Mahan, in this book, puts forward a broad thesis, that a nation, in order to be a great power, must be a great sea power, both militarily and commerically. Unfortunately, he fails to provide any evidence that supports, instead supplying his reader with blow-by-blow recaps of naval battles from the age of sailing ships. Mahan fails to convince me that the era of the sailing ship has any relevance to our era of self-propelled sea power. Nothing about Mahan's work disproves his thesis, he merely failed to prove it."
3,"Classic but dated work, tiresome and no longer valid","Okay it was a fantastic book in 1890 when it was written but today you'll be slogging thru many, many, many detailed accounts of blow by blow Naval actions in the 1650's. I couldn't understand all the terminology & I own a sailboat & go sailing. Said to be the book that led Kaiser Willm-2 into WW-I, but he wasn't a Hapsburg for his brains. Buy the recent hardcover version which is cheap & filled with many spendid illustrations if posessed by a need to read this book. You'll learn more than you ever wanted to know about how to fight a sailing ship of the 1600's. Why did he end in 1783 anyway??"
5,Best buy on Amazon!,You can find more about life from this book than any other on the planet. Hard to read -- worth the effort. Take a look at Coleman Bark's translations if you need an on ramp
3,Good Start,This book is very helpful to anyone who is beginning to research Locomotives. The information and pictures are an introduction to a subject. The reader gets just enough to whet the appetite and as the readers become more sophisticated they will move on to more detailed books. This is a good starting book
1,Save Your Money!,I recently purchased 3 Tonytails for my daughter. She is a dancer and uses them for competition. All three of them BROKE before we could get them in her hair - one was still in the package! Save your money!!
2,Good for British beginners,"This book was printed in 1995. It's British. Thus, it would be useful for those who are completely new to the idea of ""plain English,"" especially in a British context. There's nothing wrong with it, really. It's well enough written, and the advice is generally sound and perfectly applicable. But since it's so old, I certainly could not recommend it to clients or others with a straight face. There are plenty of more modern books on the market. (I will say that the price was fair: one penny plus shipping.)"
4,Early Brilliance,"Ted Marrett is a brilliant young meteorologist who has one goal: To see humanity turn weather control into a reality...and, along with several friends who stick with him through just about everything, he will do anything to accomplish that goal.The Weathermakers is a fine early novel (written in the mid-1960s) from Ben Bova... a master of ""modern-day"" and near-future science fiction. Despite having been written more than forty years ago, Bova displays the clear knowledge and mastery he has of the physical world in this novel and which shows up again and again in subsequent novels.The Weathermakers is recommended to anyone who enjoys Bova's works or is looking for a solid piece of science fiction."
4,good 'ole science fiction,"Good story line, believable characters, believable plot given the assumptions. Ironic how some of the old science fiction guesses about future technology came close to the truth while others are still far off."
3,"Not Bad, But Not Great","I'm guessing that this book is a reprint of his 1973 'Weathermakers'. I have been a Bova fan for a long time and have always enjoyed reading his books. The concept and characters that are determined to control the weather was initially intriguing. Unfortunately it wasn't enough to sustain the book the whole way through. Having read most of his works I was disappointed. If this had been the first Ben Bova book I ever read I probably wouldn't have finished it let alone buy any other of his works. I kept waiting for the book to pick up but it never did. The 'Weathermakes' was only slightly better than boring, it just fell flat overall. On the plus side his ability to see how the future of technology would unfold forty years before cell-phones and flat screens is always amazing."
4,Pretty good CD,"The Seventh Night is all an all-acoustic album. Most of the songs are really soothing and light. The other more fun ones, like 'Papa Lapped a Pap Lopped' and 'Mirror', are a great listen, too. I recommend it for long-term Gackt fans, but not someone who is just getting into his music. Try Mars or Rebirth first."
5,A Must buy!,"I have to say that anything that comes out with Gackt's name on it is a master piece. He is a God. He is the most talented Singer out there right now and not to mention he's one sexy Bishonen and he is Bisexual (look at Vanilla Live Music Video). It's a shame that not many people know about him, so I share his voice and music with everyone I can. Snap up all of his CDs you can and his Movie, Moon Child. His songs are pure talent."
5,Savage Conquest,"The book came promplty and was in very good condition. Since I had read the previous 6 books to the series, this will help to end the series."
3,Savage Conquest by Janelle Taylor,"SOUTHERN DESIRE...There was no Virginia belle more irresistible than stunning, ebony-haired Miranda Lawrence. Though the voluptuous beauty had her pick of handsome beaux, she felt a wild need deep within her for the kind of man she could never meet in polite society. Heeding the call of her passionate nature, Miranda stole away from her plantation home, heading to the unsettled West to seek exciting, never-ending love.SAVAGE PLEASURE...When Miranda reached the rugged plains of South Dakota, she suddenly found herself trapped against the broad bronze chest of a virile Indian! Her body trembled as his lips plundered hers; her knees shook as he traced his fingers along her spine. But when her stark terror turned to sensual torment, Miranda didn't know what to fear more: her fate at the hands of the masterful brave or her own traitorous heart!"
2,gold Laura Ingrham cross,"I hate giving two stars to a religious item, but i bought 5 of these thinking I would give them to some of my grandkids. I wore one for a month, it started to wear where the cross touched my body. I am totally surprised and decided not to give them out. I recommend finding a solid gold cross, something with real value."
5,Good training book,"Excellent book. It is a little to techncal for people who are inexperienced in exercise, as it seems to be written for trainers. It is a great book for fitness trainers who want to expand their swiss ball and medicine ball workouts. As a Personal Trainer, I appreciate this book and DVD."
3,I liked it!,"Although I knew a lot of the execises what I like most about the book is that it explains the effect of each movement and it shows photos for proper positioning. Each exercise also has a basic, intermediate and advanced version. For me, it was worth the purchase."
5,This is all you need.,"If your into ball training. Strength ball training is the only book you will need. This has every possible excercise you can do with a strength ball. Plus some! Highly recomended for the ball trainers. Plus you can do it at home,for you television buffs,even in front of your T.V."
1,...,"Don't know what everyone else was reading, but both of these stories were terrible, in my opinion.The first one, I already left a review for under the solo book.The second one, Abbey just rubbed me the wrong way, I guess. She was so rude to Matt, and acted more like a teenager than an adult.Neither of these stories were in any way romantic. But LaVyrle Spencer doesn't write great romance anyway."
5,Excellent product for the price.,"A friend gave me a Grover-Trophy whistle a few months ago, but I accidentally dropped it into a bonfire, which warped the plastic on it, rendering it unusable. Since then, I have been looking for a replacement. I bought a slide whistle made by another manufacturer, which was of terrible quality... it didn't even work right, had terrible sound, couldn't use half of the available range of the slide.This slide whistle has no major flaws, is of excellent quality, especially for how cheap it is. I am very satisfied."
4,Grover plastic slide better than Yankee metal,"When I wanted a slide whistle to accompany a storyteller, I chose the Yankee cause it was made of metal and a bit more expensive than the plastic Grover. The metal slide whistle works for 2 blows and then gets very airy sounding. The pitch range is very limited. After working with it for several months and trying many different ways of blowing into it, tightening it, wiping it etc--I gave up and got a Grover--a good ole classic plastic slide whistle. Sounds great--great pitch range and consistent sound for long periods of play. Get it if you want a good slide whistle."
3,grand loves it,"My grandson loves this but be prepared for how LOUD it can be. It can hurt our ears. My grandson is blind and special needs, and he loves that he can work this."
3,"good whistle, wrong color","I ordered this whistle (shown in red) for my son (who loves red)...it arrived in purple, my son was not impressed. Whistle works well so far, though.Wish I had known that the colors vary and no returns are excepted :("
3,Tried to replace,I ordered this trying to replace my son's old plastic one that is being held by so many pieces of tape. He won't let me get rid of it so this one just sits in a drawer collecting dust.
4,These are great for the frog lover.,"Gave these to my niece for Christmas. She loves frogs, and they were a BIG hit."
2,A Mistake,"To be honest, I must have hit a button by mistake which caused me to order something I really hadn't intended on buying. There was no way to cancel it on-line so I figured I'd give the CD a listen, since I had Nellie's first CD, which I love. I must say, I was disappointed. Just seemed like every song sounded the same. Maybe it will grow on me, the more I listen to it, but kinda doubting it."
2,Sometimes you should listen to the suits,"Get Away From Me is one of my favorite albums of the last 6 months or so (I came late to the party). The first time I heard it I listened to it three times in a row.Not so with this album. Didn't really need to hear it again. It lacks the individualistic qualities of Get Away. Where are the biting, ironic lyrics and the toying with the traditional music forms that made the first collection so much fun? There's just nothing here that grabs the listener. It's unfocused, just about all the songs are the same mid-tempo pace, and the production is muddy.The story of the put-upon songwriter struggling with the big-bad recording company doesn't make this collection any better. Sounds like McKay did a tremendous amount of work to get this together, so it's a shame the end result isn't better.I'm sure she still has a great career ahead."
2,"JOHN HUSTON, OPUS 27","Rarely seen nowaday , this movie could be considered as a study of class relations in the Middle Ages between the Nobles, the Church and the rest of the Nation. If you're not interested in these matters, you could possibly like the main plot describing a love story between a scholar and a noble damsel trying to survive and find happiness in the middle of a civil war. For my part, A Walk with Love and Death is already forgotten. Unfortunately."
1,Entire chapter on stress and strain unreadable due to sign errors,"Sign errors almost on every page in the entire introductory chapter on stress and strain.Author uses convention that compressive stress is positive, as is usual in rock mechanics.Then the traction given by the stress tensor should be-T*n_vector, but author uses T*n_vector.The sign error is ""remedied"" by the mathematically nonsens statement on page 11""The Chartesian component of the traction p in any direction r is considered tobe a positive number if the inner product of p and a unit vector in the r direction is NEGATIVE.""Well, everywhere else in mathematics and physics the component of a vector palong a unit vector n is defined as p * n, and is positive if p * n is POSITIVE."
1,This is Junk,"i dont know where to start. i used this thing like 2 times a day and it never ever ever worked. everytime i used it id feel a bunch of drying but then the next day, i still had pimples. pure trash ill never get this again. try Proactiv that actually works unlike this useless waste of money."
3,I liked this product. The texture of the ...,"I liked this product. The texture of the wash is very nice and smooth, with no irritating grits. I did have a few breakouts during the first few days of using it. I would probably purchase this product in the future."
4,I really liked Clearasil Daily Facial Wash. I ...,"I really liked Clearasil Daily Facial Wash. I use it nightly and my face seems to be less oily in the morning than it used to be. I wish the wash was a tiny bit stronger and had a nicer scent, but it lathers up nice and seems to get my face very clean. The only other problem I have with this product is that it's so thick (which is good) that it's kind of hard to squeeze out of the tube, and then the tube doesn't go back to its original shape easily (which is bad). Overall, though, thumbs up to this product!"
4,I am 36 years old and had not ...,"I am 36 years old and had not used Clearasil since I was a teenager. Having mostly dry skin, I've used the Clearasil Face Wash in the shower every morning. I think that it has moisturized my face without causing it to be oily. I have always been afraid to put moisturizer on my face thinking that it would be too oily. I didn't think that it lathered like I expected, but all and all, it's a product that I would purchase in the future."
4,I had been using soap and water as ...,I had been using soap and water as my cleanser for some time. My face has always been dry in the winter. I've been using only the Clearasil facial cleanser for five days now and I can already feel the difference in my skin. I've already recommended this product to my daughter and I'll definitely recommend it to others.
5,Judaic Artisans Today,"I purchased this book as a gift for a friend who is herself a Judaic Artisan. The book includes stunning Judaica in many mediums. I can wholeheartedly recommend this book, especially for anyone who is working in Judaica art of any kind."
4,"Sex, drugs, murder, affairs, love....it's all here","Sex, drugs, murder, affairs, love....it's all here. In that respect this book is predictable. However, I felt that the plot kept moving along unexpectedly and quickly which took away a lot of the predictability. Overall it was a very entertaining read."
1,Disappointing,"The first chapter had me interested and thinking I had found a well-written mystery novel. By the next chapter disappointment was setting in, and, after that I mostly skimmed the pages to the end. I didn't care for the main character, by the end she was acting silly, ""oh, why did I give my cellphone away in this extremely dangerous situation?"" It also started out grippingly about the kidnapped girl, but, the suspense and terror of it fell apart, too. This book is too long, way too long. The way the man, Dan, talked was off in many places, to my thinking. Dropping his g's at the end of words, saying ain't-who does this guy work for again? The baby was sick too much, too. I didn't like this book."
2,Reads like a romance novel,"The story was good, but a bit far-fetched. However, the further I got into the book, the more difficult it was to actually finish it (which I eventually did). The problem was that as the story progressed it became more and more like a trashy romance novel, making it difficult to enjoy the story itself.Unless the author can get away from her emphasis on the childish behavior of the heroine, I doubt I would ever pick up another of her books."
5,Another great Melaine Vargas story,She's finally coming around in this book to dumping her ex & hooking up with Dan O'Reilly.
4,Yehudi Great. Jeremy just OK,"Solid version, albeit lacking some fire. It was a bargain for the price and still a good performance. Worth buying."
2,Very disappointed in DVD,"RING OF FIRE is not on this DVD. it is an extremely low budget DVD and I would not recommend purchasing it. He has another DVD, but that doesn't have RING OF FIRE ON it either. I purchased it on other people's recommendations, but am disappointed I did so. I would not recommend it, due to it's very low Quality."
4,John Cash finale,"This DVD earned a fourth star from me because this performance marks the last time I am likely to see him perform a whole concert. As a live show, it is probably only worth three stars, but even at that it is quite good.It gave me an opportunity to have a private uninterrupted goodbye experience with the near mythic performer."
4,Good christmas mix,Good mix of tunes to add to the normal mix one usually gets on a christmas album.
4,This CD Album is very explicit,Parents should be warned about the explicit language used in this album. Even though there is profanity used I still say this album is worth buying
3,when is this dude gonna release a greatest hits?!,"""You Make Me Wanna..."" is definitely the best track, very catchy. It has an extremely memorable techno harp/guitar-ish background effect (think TLC's ""No Scrubs,"" Pink's ""There You Go,"" Destiny's Child's ""Bills, Bills, Bills""). My only complaint is that Usher desperately needs to do a few more dance songs, why all the ballads...? He's a great dancer but I doubt he's ever able to use them, he does so many slow songs."

5,I own this C.D.It is great!,I had never heard of Usher When I heard the song My Way.I then purchased the C.D.and found that I enjoyed the whole C.D.
2,You Make Me Wanna...Listen To The First CD Instead,"Usher's first CD was a promise of good things to come. ""MY WAY""s first single fulfilled the promise. From there, the rest of the CD just didn't live up to his talent. Granted the title track is funky enough, but the rest of the album lacks substance and anything noteworthy. Only 9 songs!!!and a remix just doesn't do justice as a follow up album and someone who is as gifted as Usher. I'll wait for his third offering and hope it's the real sequel to his first CD."
2,idont really like it,i dont really like usher he has a nice body but an ugly face just like chris king without the nice body
3,I give this a 3.5,"I picked up this album back in 98' when I first heard the single ""You Make Me Wanna"", this album is surprisly parental advisory. Usher tries to be more rap like in this album, and you can tell too because he has Lil Kim on ""Just Like Me"". When Usher starts getting into rap the music is dead because Usher is more of a R&B/Soul hip hop type of person. This album has some good songs like ''My Way'' and '' You Make Me Wanna''. But with hits like ''Slow Jam'', with Monica, Usher really shows he is a really good singer. The LP is way too short and there are a couple of fillers, moust notibly ''You Make Me Wanna'' extended version. Usher is a good singer and when he stays at that and not at that P. Diddy stuff(which is probably why he made that rap song because of Diddy status of commerical R&B/Rap back in 97,98)he really shows hes a star."
4,This album rocks,"This album is pretty cool, the only problem being that it is way too short for a proper album. The radio-friendly (sarcasm) Just Like Me is the best track on the album.Would be a five if it wasn't so short"
4,good,"you have you make me wanna best r&b track in a long time ,my way an incredibly hookfull track ,and just like me and nice and slow two good tracks i didnt know jd had it in him to produce tracks like these but i guess i was wrong a must own even with haLf the album bein filler"
3,Usher has potential,"Usher's new album is just a bit over-rated. Credit is given where credit is due, Usher and the people behind him know how to get attention (take your shirt off Usher, and let the young girls scream!) Musically, though, Usher's album is just good, not great. The lead single ""You Make Me Wanna,"" makes me wanna turn it off. The second single was great. ""Nice and Slow"" is more than just nice it is spectacular. More songs like this one would solidify Usher as the prince of hip-hop soul. ""Bedtime"" follows ""Nice and Slow's"" lead. The title track is the most disappointing of all. The beat is worst than whack and the song plain and simply sucks. This album is filled with too many highs and lows to be considered great. But in today's music world all that matters is how much it sales, not how good the quality is (paging Spice Girls.)"
4,HIS WAY,Usher is starting to really establish himself with this disc. You can hear all the elements coming together as he develops into the 'star' who eventurally creates 'BURN' and 'CONFESSIONS'
5,i give nuff respect,well i think for his age he is just da bomb i would apreciate if he could come this side here in zimbabwe keep up the good work
3,Good!,This is a good album...but the replay value is not so good! The songs just don't sound the same......but I still recommend people to at least give this one a listen if not a buy. Peace out folks!
5,ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS TIZZIGHT!! =),"OK where to start! FIRST OF ALL I LOVE USHER! I HAVE HIS PICS ALL OVER MY WALL!! I LISTEN TO HIS TIGHT CD LIKE 20 TIMES A DAY! HIS CD IS SOO GOOD! ITS ACTUALLY A CD THAT LISTEN TO EVERY SONG! USUALLY ON CD'S U ONLY LISTEN TO A FEW SONGS BUT ""MY WAY' U CAN ACTUALLY LISTEN TO THE WHOLE THING!! THE WHOLE CD IS AWESOME!! HE IS MY HUSBAND HE JUST DOESNT KNOW IT!! lol! =) I HAVE HIS VIDEOS TAPED AND WATH THENM ALL THE TIME!! I LOVE USHER!!!"
2,good case but poor belt clip,"like the other reviews,the clip of this product it's a waste of money!there's no good clips for this cel.because i try another ones but it's the same history!"
3,Lasted for 6 months,"Guess I cannot complain too much. Fits like a glove on the phone (bad pun). The clip is a bit clunky to get on and off.Biggest complaint is the clip tearing away from the nylon and leather insert. A little super glue fixed it for a while, but the leather backing where the clip attaches cracked and split beyond repair. Next case please (another bad pun)..."
2,"Good looking, but bad clip","I bought this case a month and half ago. After one month of using it, the clip seemed to not stick perfectly to the nylon inside, resulting the entire case to not fit as it was before.This is a good looking case, but with a poor clip."
5,The truth of the Soldiers of Sadr City.,This story was truly an eye opener for everyone who saw it. The story was about my Husband's Army unit and the work they did in a short period of time in Sadr City.
3,Anne Mather,"Miranda hadn't married Jaime Knevett for love; in fact she hardly knew him, and she had never liked what little she had known-but her mother needed help and this was the only way Miranda could provide it. In fact it had never been a true marriage and the two of them had parted almost immediately after the wedding. All that had been four years ago, but now Miranda was thinking of marrying Paul Courtenay, so here she was in Brazil, to meet Jaime once again to ask for an annulment. But Jaime was still a man to reckoned with; even if he would agree to the end of their marriage, could Miranda be absolutely sure, now, that that was what she really wanted?"
4,crossroads of history,"Serrano was a writer and diplomat who sought out 2 masters as a spiritual/philosophic seeker. Fascinating biography, mixed with Serrano's own fixations.Serrano later fixated on Adolph Hitler, so there certainly seems to be a germanic bent that he followed. ReadBlack Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identityto see the strange path the author took after his encounters with Hesse and Jung."
5,"Fantastic, Tender, Love Story.","I absolutely loved this book. Jenny is a fantastic heroine who is very special. Born with down syndrome. She knows that she is different and loves with her heart. She never expects to have the love that her mother has found. She's wrong. Daniel Sullivan falls hard and fast. Daniel is a great hero. He is so Tender and loving to Jenny. He accepts her as she is and never makes her feel different from everyone else. Their love is so Pure and Special that no one, not even Daniel's nasty past can come between them. I highly recommend this book. I wish there were more like it out there."
1,recieved broken,This vacuum cleaner was recieved with a broken handle and I was told I would be given a refund and would have to order another vacuum cleaner.
1,Junk,"I had this vacuum five minutes before pieces of the bristles from the brush roll were flying all over. It is a cheaply made vacuum. Of course for being a commercial vacuum it is certainly on the low end, so what can one expect?"
3,Smells great but dries my skin,"I have mixed emotions about this wash. It smells absolutely wonderful. But, it really dries my skin something terrible. I absolutely cannot use it in the winter or my skin peels, but in the summer, I can use it twice a week or so. It smells just divine so I hope they can make another one with more moisturizers in it. It rinses without a nasty residue, however, and does a nice job when you're shaving with it. Great value here too on amazon."
5,missing planes of the 452nd bomb group,"This book in a ""matter of fact"" manner graphically provides an insight into the lives of our brave WWII heroes and what they contributed to the defeat of Nazi Germany. The names of the planes, the names of the crew and events that happened when the plane was lost, such as ""??name omitted?? jumped from plane without his chute"". What horror! What bravery?"
4,1st solo album,"talk about a different approach! still a great album as a whole, ""give me something to grab for"" is the only ""CarIsh"" song on the album, listen for ""a quick one"" as a second best. but this album should be interpeted as a side album ONLY, give the entire album a listen...about 20 times and you will like it."
3,Not the Cars.,"Ric Ocasek's ""Beatitude"" #28, was his first solo release. When I bought this in '82, I had just heard the single ""Something To Grab For"" #47 hot 100 and #5 mainstream rock, it had that classic Cars sound, so I thought man this is gonna be one hell of a record, put it on and i'm in shock, very moody sounding and totaly downcast. I still like some of the songs in ""Jimmy Jimmy"" #25 mainstream rock, what a story. ""I Can't Wait"" and the spooky ""Time Bomb"". ""This Side Of Paradise"" in 1986 would return Ric to his Cars sound."
2,Something of a disappointment,"In my opinion, the lead single from this album, Something To Grab For, is one of the great forgotten tunes of the early MTV years, and I bought the album fully expecting it to be as enjoyable as that song and the Car's songs that came before it. Unfortunately it didn't happen that way. I've listened to it time and again over the years and never find myself able to make a connection with anything but Something To Grab For, no matter how many serious listenings I subject it to. After this Ric's solo stuff got progressively more odd, so I guess it's to be expected that he started losing me right off the bat."
1,NOT A GREAT SOLO EFFORT,"Not a great start for Cars' frontman Rick. Connect up yo You, Jimmy Jimmy, and Quick One, are the highlights of a rather stale cd. The songs seem uninsipred, and the production sterile. Pick his later cds, or his CARS cds."
2,Past His Prime,"Ric Ocasek has just kept right on making new Cars albums, long after the rest of us have moved on, it's sad, really"
1,Doesn't fit bottle!!,What else to say? It doesn't fit my 1.5 liter bottle. Been waiting over 3 weeks for a remedy from company.
3,"could have been, should have been","I can only give this compilation of videos of the Bangles' pop-rock confections three stars due to its poor video quality and lack of ""extras"" like interviews or live cuts. It is also a reminder that the Bangles were a could have been, should have been great band. Here we see four talented people, for whom, never-the-less, the sum was greater than the parts. If egos had not intervened, the Bangles might have made several more quality albums that perhaps would have established an important place for them in a pantheon that has a dearth of all-female rock bands. Instead they are a group that had a place in the sun for a few years and a handful of pleasant hits, as this collection of videos wistfully attests."
5,An Excellent Collection of Bangles Best Music Videos,"If you're like me and you really love that 80's rock, girl groups, and you're a big fan of music videos, then you'll be totally happy to own this awesome collection. It includes such hits as 'Going Down to Liverpool' (gueststar: Leonard Nimoy - ""Spock""), 'Manic Monday', 'Walk Like an Egyptian', 'In Your Room' (who can forget Ms. Hoffs' promise to ""...teach you everything a boy should know""), 'Eternal Flame', and several more.If you're dead sick of MTV and want to finally see some good videos, then you simply must buy this one. Although, the sound quality is not up to today's highest standards, this is a very good product.Also, check out B-52's video collection (2 VHS) and Cyndi Lauper ""Twelve Deadly Cyns..."" music videos collection (1 DVD)."
5,Review from a high school student,"I used this book as a resource for my AP US History term paper, and it was by far the best resource I could find on Jacksonian democracy. Schlesinger carefully details the events and attitudes surrounding the shift from Jeffersonian to Jacksonian (modern) democracy. It is tough reading, and there are a few somewhat opinionated comparisons between the 1940s and 1830s, but it is outstanding history."
5,A Political Thriller Not Written by Tom Clancy...,"I was forced to read The Age of Jackson in fulfillment of credit in AP History. I found the book absolutely delightful. It gives great insight into the administration of Jackson and also into the other men who made up that administration. Schlesinger writes a page-turning biography if that doesn't sound strange. Plus, the use of footnotes lets the reader know the book is an excellent source of information."
5,A must-read classic,This book is definitely still relevant. It provides many valuable insights into the period. Highly recommended.
2,Awful,"I quit reading this book halfway through. Having said that, I'll offer the following observations. First, the research is incredible- he made good use of primary source material, and cited it very thoroughly. That's why I gave him two stars. However, he is terribly tedious, unfocused, and slants leftward at a ninety-degree angle. I would only use this book if I had something that slanted rightward to the same degree to balance it. He is certainly not as objective as a historian should be."
5,Age of the Third Greatest Presidents,The AGE OF JACKSON is one of the greatest of the histories by this talented and scholarly historian. It is a book that enlarges our understanding of the environment of the age when our Union was seriously threatened and saved by this slave-holder president. It is both sympathetic and realistic in its evaluation of Andrew Jackson. Should be read by every American and I guarantee pleasure.
5,Masterful!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am very disapointed in the fact that this masterpiece has not recieved a higher rating it is one of the best historical works to date and recieves appraise. In noted Jackson historian and biographer, Robert V. Remini's words, ""For the history of this period generally, especially to catch the color and the splash of the times, there is no better book than Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr's book The Age of Jackson. For the history lover who would like to read further into the life and times of the ""fighting president"" check out Robert Remini's numerous works on Andrew Jackson."
1,Dizzied,"There are only three books I've ever wanted to throw in the trash. This book is one of them. Schlesinger runs up and down the decades, around the nation, and across the list of characters in a disorganized frenetic movement that reminds me of nothing so much as my hyperactive, attention deficit disordered son during Saturday morning cartoons. One moment he's writing about Hamilton in the revolution, the next he's discoursing on Jackson's death. I picked up this book off the remainder shelf. I wish it had remained there."
3,somewhat interesting,"the quality of this documentary isnt very good... it seems like it was filmed quite a while ago on poor equipment. i highly recommend that you buy ""memories and mysteries"" instead... almost the exact same documentary, but the sound quality is FAR better(i could barely understand the narrator on this dvd!) plus it has a few extra features."
1,This DVD (disappointed),"I ignored the reviews written by other people and decided to buy this DVD anyway. Boy am I sorry!This DVD is awful. The sound and picture quality made me feel like I was watching a bootleg videotape. The other features (disappoint) also. It has trivia and something about the men in her life that you can only read about. Reading a book on Marilyn is more fascinating than watching this.Heed my advice and others, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!"
4,"Rather sad, but...","nevertheless a very nice book. ""Kes"" is essentially about a community which fails its young. The protagonist, Billy, is an apparently backward kid. The three worlds of the play are home, school and field. Home is Billy, his brother Jud and his mum where he is neglected and beaten up. School is a boy lost in a muddle of many others each hoping for futures out of this existence. Billy's solace is his pet kestrel, on which he lavishes all the tenderness he has never known. That's why the field where he flies his bird is a world of adventure and of escape. A land without maps or boundaries.The author manages to create an image in the reader's mind that gives him a deep insight into Billy's live and his problems. You feel with the protagonist and also feel sorry for him.That's the reason why I really enjoyed reading this book and if you like rather sad books that make you think even after finishing them I would recommend you to read ""Kes""!!!"
5,William,"This was a very good DVD. Avid Mets fans will enjoy it very much. Main program is the same as the SportsNet New York (SNY) hour-long show on TV. However, the DVD contains some extra material (segment on Dave Mlicki's shutout in first Subway series game ever, for instance). There is also some ""bonus"" material of great moments like last inning of 1969 World Series from the NBC TV coverage, for example. Well worth the price if you are a big Mets fan like me. One note however - this is also contained as one DVD in the Mets 50th Anniversary 10 DVD set (extra & bonus materials also)."
4,Mahjong tile set,"My new Mahjong set arrived ahead of time and in good shape. However one of the tiles had paint on the side, and that was an issue. Anyone who plays Mahjong knows that you don't want a tile that identifies itself when it is in your hand or on the board. We were able to sand the paint off, but I am not sure how you would deal with this kind of issue if you weren't able to remove the paint, unless you sent the whole set back. This is just the problem of ordering something you have not been able to inspect before hand. The set did not come with enough plastic coins to play our version of MJ, and there was not an options to order more. Frankly this set is pricey, and while the wood trays are nice, the tiles are the same as the ones you get with the less expensive version of the set with the plastic trays."
1,No Bargain here...,Now I can see why this was in the bargain bin. The story is lame and half way through at the latest you know how this is going to end. Medium grade illustration. Save you'r money.
3,A review from EX JEWS FOR JESUS,"I am a former missionary who served with Jews for Jesus.I found the book very similar to the many training lectures I heard while serving on Jews for Jesus staff.This book just does not tell the complete story.Many of the people who worked for Jews for Jesus have incredible stories that have not been told. Some of the stories are good, but some are bad.Ex Jews for Jesus staff have come together recently and are putting stories together. It is a shame that Ruth Tucker did not tell many of those stories in her book."
1,the rest of the story,"JFJ paid Ms Tucker...to write this book - it is not history, but rather tells their story as they paid to have it told. For the rest of the story, visit the [web] site."
5,LUNA TAKES YOU TO THE STARS,I loved this book. I read all the time and this is my all time favorite. You will leave this book only to return to it often. I recommed this to anyone who wants a great read.
5,A wonderful and timely book,"I think this is Julie Anne Peters' best book to date. A goodinsight is provided into what it means to be trans, withoutbogging down in details. Telling the story from Regan's pointof view makes it easier to explore the major problem withtransition, the reactions of everyone around you, and alsoprovides many subtle ways to look at the social constructionof gender without becoming pedantic. This is a must read foranyone dealing with trans issues. Don't miss Peters' otherYA books, either!"
5,Luna,"I really loved this book; it made me look at and destroy the prejudice inside me, and put me in a transgender's shoes. Every page brought new horrors and delights, and made the horrible things that people that are so drastically different as Luna go through amazingly real. I'd recommend this book to everyone; it made me think really hard for a comparatively easy read."
4,Powerful.,"I would recommend reading this to every child, to help them understand that no matter how different you are, different is beautiful and who we must all be."
3,Pretty good,"Mostly good but I really wanted more insight from Liam/Luna than from her sister. But overall, a good read for young adults about transgender/gender identity."
3,Very slow,"I read through Luna, it took me about a month when a very good book can take me a few hours to read. The storyline was good, but everything in the book moved so slow and there was barely any action to it."
5,Great read!,This book really gets into the mind of a teen girl with her brother's secret eating her whole and finally setting her free. Highly recommended.
2,Waste of money.,"These filters sort of do what they are expected but they are of such low quality that sharp pictures are largely out of the question. The lens and frame both have very low design standards, lack coatings that prevent reflection/fringe, and are threaded in a manner that can cause them to become stuck on an adapter.Spend the few extra bucks on a decent quality Hoya or B&W; polarizer/clear protection filter, they are worth every penny and the S3 can be set to compensate for most indoor lighting situations.HOYA 52MM CIR- POLARISING FILTER GHoya 52mm DMC PRO1 Clear Protector Digital Filter"
5,Sunflowers,I received this as a gift for Valentines Day. It took a while to figure out how to put the extension/converter on. I had to look at the owner s manual for a while to get it. A ring come off the camera lens while you put the button on the bottom. Then you affix the converter then screw on with the filter. When I shot the picture I rememebered to twist the filter so the polarizing effect would work and be darker. I did this with my pictures today and they were Wonderful. The picture was a deep blue polarizing effect without being too blue it was natural. I could n t ask for a better filter and conversion. The Conversion was actually made with metal like substance which is better. Most are made with plastic. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a filter system. I am glad my friend bought it for my Valentine s Gift. It made a wonderful gift.
2,It's OK,"I bought this after I read reviews about how wonderful it tastes. Well, it didn't taste that great to me. It didn't taste like berries. I was using Chewable Vitamin C by NOW products and that orange taste was like drinking a glass of Tang.The tablets are HUGE! It was a little hard to just pop in your mouth and chew. I won't be buying this anymore. No one in my family likes it and I am stuck chewing all of this!"
3,Taste is terrible,I am sure these are really great for you but I was unable to eat them and my children refused due to the terrible taste
2,Awful taste,"The plus to these is that they are naturally flavored and colored. The down side is the taste. Nasty! My kids won't take them, I won't take them....wasted $."
4,Vit C,"I bought this Vit C chewable as I cannot swallow pillsIt has a great taste and it is so easy to just let them melt in your mouthThe price is very good for the quantity and comes in a different variety of flavorsI especially like it as it does not have a lot of unnecessary additivesThe only thing I am suggesting is the sugar , dextrose , fructose ??? you have enough sugar from the fruit extract , I don't think we need more addedOtherwise good value ."
5,Tasty and good for you.,"I havesnt had a cold all season, and I'm crediting these Vitamin C tablets, plus they are tasty, so it is not a problem remembering to take one, or having my kids do the same. Thanks. Very speedy delivery."
1,Yuck,"This bottle smells so good, I thought these would taste even better than the Nature Made orange flavored C tablets we usually take. Boy was I wrong. Colored with red cabbage????? Did they think the flavor wouldn't get in there too? Who needs color in their vitamins, artificial or natural? I wish I had read reviews before purchasing.I understand why some people awarded stars for ""quality"". But I don't see what's so hard about making pure, natural vitamin C tablets, so I'm being a toughie and 1 star it is. I'm so cheap I'll probably end up using them. Doubt my husband will touch them.Edit: I just finished reading the rest of the ingredients. They also contain rose hips, which many people (and my pet chinchillas) like, but which I detest. Live and learn."
3,"Flavor is ""off""","These taste weird. Like you can taste the cabbage in them or something.I've had worse tasting vitamin C chewables, but these are really kind of weird tasting. I doubt my kids will eat them twice."
3,Book Description,"This second edition has been retitled Basic College Math: A Problem Solving Approach from Arithmetic: A Problem Solving Approach based on feedback from instructors from all over the country. Like the first, the second edition provides all the basic concepts that are necessary for the further study of mathematics and enables students to solve everyday problems. Topics have been added to enhance the students' understanding and ability to manipulate mathematically."
2,Never enough,"A friend of mine got me hooked and I just can't seem to get enough. I can finish off one book start to finish with no stopping in under 4hrs. So to say that the book is to short or makes short cuts. Well lets just say there are ideas and things that could happen to drang out the book even more, but has anyone ever noticed a book gets BORING if you drag it out to far. With Christine's books its a matter of person prefrence and understanding of the series to comprehend."
5,Three excellent stories under one cover,"I've been waiting and waiting for this book, with stories by Christine Feehan, Susan Grant and Susan Squires. I am VERY happy with the escapes from reality that these three authors have given us...Christine tells a Carpathian story with a bit of a twist...an alpha female! Excellent, excellentSusan Grant's story was different from her usual stories...a furistic world after destruction...wonderfully doneThis was my first read of a Susan Squires story...very well done. I like the idea of the ""companions"". will be looking for more from this authorI'd like to see more of these characters and plots in future books...These three women are auto-buys in my house...recommend that you put them to the top of your auto-buy list <G>"
3,Love Feehan But Should Have Gotten At The Library,"Just an ok book. Feehan's story was her typical Carpthian novel but it wasn't long enough to develop the characters. Star Queen by Susan Grant. I thought was awful and wouldn't ever want to wish on anyone. The third is Sacrilege and it was average at best but at least had an interesting twist on things. Overall, I would save the money and buy secondhand or go to the library."
2,Did I miss something?,"... I didn't like these stories. Reading the stories in this book is like when you watch a movie, only you've missed the beginning, and you have no idea who the players are and where the story is going. The only thing I can think of, is if you read these authors all the time, then these stories make sense. Otherwise, like me, you find yourself wondering why you bought this book."
5,Not for Newbies!,"There have been lots of plot synopses and comments for the various stories... I'm going to step forward with some important info that a casual reader may not notice about this book:THE ONLY ONE is an anthology of three novella--each a sequel in some way, shape or form. Presumably the idea is that readers of one world will buy the book, read the other novella, and search out the other volumes to the various worlds. An interesting concept--but with one flaw. Unless you read these series, these short novella are NOT going to be as interesting.So--if you enjoy Grant's STAR series, or SQUIRES' Sacrament, or if you collect Feehan's DARK stories--you may want this anthology. If you read all three, it's a definite must-buy, just to see what these authors add to their worlds... if you haven't read anything from any of them... give the anthology a skip and pick up the first book from the world that MOST interests you."
1,Very Disappointing and Frustrating,"I'm a big fan of the Dark Series (Christine Feehan) and I was very disappointed. The story was horrible; I felt so let down!!! I was totally looking forward to this book and instead of feeling like wow she did it again I felt like oh my god who in gods name wrote this story because it could not have been Christine. This story should have been more developed than it was; when I turned the page and saw that the story was finished, I just said oh no she did not just do this!!!"
3,Saved By Christine Feehan's Dark Descent!,"A Friend suggested that I pick this book up and so I did. I am new to Christine Feehan and her dark series so was not sure what I was getting into but I found that I liked this story very much I only wish that it had been a full lenghth story instead of a short one. The concept was fun and a good introduction to her series for a ""newbie"" like me.The other stories in the book were entertaining but if I had had the choice of picking them up and reading them as singular titles I probably would have not bothered. All in all these group of stories entertaining and worth reading."
1,Disappointment galore,"When I bought the book I thought...Wow! But as I began to read my excitment turned to disappointment. The first story is a repeat of the second story in Dark Prince, the second story was all over the place and I counldn't get into it, and the third? Yawn!!! I love Christine Feehan's work but I would not have bought this book if Ihad known the contents."
2,What a let down!,"I was very much looking forward to the next book in the Dark Hunter series (Christine Feehan) This was a big disappointment. Where was the character development? I could complain at length about inconsistances but would end up giving away the story. It read like a comic strip. The story seemed full of teasers for future books. The ending was terrible, this was too short to engage the reader (who would have to have read previous books in the series to make any sense of the plot). I felt like that about the other short stories in this anthology. I kept thinking I was missing a big chunk of the story line."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I AM A HUGE CHRISTINE FEEHAN FAN, I HAVE ALL HER BOOKS. I LOOKED FORWARD TO THE RELEASE OF THE ONLY ONE AND WAS SO DISAPPOINTED. THIS STORY SHOULD HAVE BEEN A FULL LENGTH NOVEL. THERE WAS SO MUCH GOING ON THAT COULD NOT BE FULLY DEVELOPED IN SUCH A SMALL BOOK, THE CHARACTERS GOT CHEATED BECAUSE THEY HAD SO MUCH POTENTIAL BUT WERE NOT FULLY DEVELOPED AND THE END JUST LEFT YOU HANGING. I HOPE THIS BOOK IS REWRITTEN FOR A FUTURE RELEASE DATE BECAUSE IT COULD BE GREAT."
2,Not worth the wait,"As someone has mentioned in a earlier reivew, I can understand their disappointment. I am a great fan of Christine Feehan and even her story line was not good. There are no words to describe the remaining two stories because there was no plot build up at all. If you are a fan of Christine Feehan, I would recommend any other books than this one."
2,What happened???,"I like Christine Feehan's books, and have read all her Carpathian novels...this short story is too short. I couldn't believe it when I turned the last page and the story was over...many issues are not resolved. I imagine that some of the issues raised in this story will be dealt with in a future novel, but it is still disappointing..."
1,Indeed! What IS all the fuss about?,"I decided to check in and see what sort of reviews this CD has received and now I must put in my two cents' worth in echoing the negative comments. I read about Ades in the New Yorker about two years ago and then picked up this CD to check out his music. What a disappointment! To sum it all up very quickly and be done with it: the music is TOTALLY derivative. Anyone who has a fair knowledge of 20th century composition will not be in the least surprised or inspired. What was amusing about the New Yorker article was Ades' rather callow criticism of Brahms as being a bit tired or something along that line. Please, Tom! Don't be silly!"
3,I've read better,"I read another Jill McCorkle book, Ferris Beach, and loved it. This book I am having trouble getting into. The main character, Virginia, is so depressed and angry it makes it hard to read about her or relate to her permanent bad mood. I also find it hard to keep track of the relatives and relationships between all the characters in the story. The old ladies in the story are funny but hard to keep track of what is going on because they flip between past events and current events in the same paragraph.If this had been my first McCorkle purchase it probably would have been my last."
5,Float Tube Fins,"Nice oversize fins with easy set up for the boot waders, purchased with the Cumberland Float Tube. My son loved it."
1,Possibly the worst fins made...,"The buckle system is useless. It's sloppy, poorly designed and frustrating. The fins are barely adequate. Tape a couple ping pong paddles to your feet and you will do better. Thoroughly disappointing product and design. The only viable description is ""junk"""
1,rip off fins,save your money these are junk so uncomfortable so large will not stay on first time out one fell off and i spent the rest of my percious fishing time looking for ths junk but i evetually found this oversized junk
4,SEQUEL,THIS IS A SEQUEL TO THE FIRST BOOK WRITTEN BY TAMERA ALEXANDER. I LOVE THE WAY SHE WRITES. SHE MAKES YOU REALLY BE A PART OF HER STORY. YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT THE BOOK DOWN. SHE DOES ALL THIS VERY TASTEFULLY.
2,"""You are more""","There is a song by the band Tenth Avenue North called ""You are more"", it epitomizes this book. ""You are more than the coices that you've made/you are more than your past mistakes/you've been remade"". And while Annabelle spends most of the book finding that out, which I am perfectly fine with. It is just that I would like to see this character fully accept herself in Christ. Which by the end of the book she doesn't. Does Matthew ever forgive his father? Does Matthew and Annabelle ever end up saying ""I love you""? And what happends to Sadie? Lots of questions that didn't get answered."
5,The BEST in the series,"This one really and truly is the best in the Fountain Creek Chronicles. Riveting and romantic. If you're looking for a titillating keep-you-at-the-edge-of-your-seat, meanwhile wholesome romance book, this is it."
1,Are these reviews real?,This soap has 8 reviews written in a span of 3 days. Most of them look alike. I really suspect if these are geniune reviews.
4,I really did enjoy using the Caress soap. ...,"I really did enjoy using the Caress soap. It left my skin feeling very moisturized and the smell lasted a lot longer than most of the soaps I've tried. (But I did think the smell was a little strong for me.) It cleaned really well, also unlike most of the moisturizing bars I've used. I'd definitely tell my friends about this product."
4,I enjoyed the scent of the Caress bar. ...,"I enjoyed the scent of the Caress bar. I have very dry skin and it didn't dry my skin out. I felt, for bar soap, it was very moisturizing and left my skin feeling clean without any dull buildup. I'd recommend this product to family and friends."
4,"The clean, refreshing scent was great. This soap ...","The clean, refreshing scent was great. This soap left our skin feeling soft, smooth, and clean. We've enjoyed Caress products in the past, and this was no exception. I'd definitely recommend it to others."
3,I didn't find it to be any different ...,"I didn't find it to be any different than any other soap. I do like the scent and texture though. I'm not sure if this product impressed me enough to want to recommend it to someone. However I'd explain that I tried it and since everyone has a different kind of skin texture, they can all make their own judgements."
3,Not One of Her Best.,"Being adopted and searching for my 'unknown' father myself, meant this was timely reading and I was eager to see Lesley's composition on the topic. It was an enjoyable read but I feel Lesley's way of writing historical stories much more spell binding. I enjoyed the story more when it flicked back to Daisy's time of birth. Loved the twist in it."
5,A continuing saga of the Free Bards,"This is a tale of free bards, gypsies, non-humans, evil priests, and magic. It is book two of the series, and both continues characters from the previous book and introduces new characters that reappear in later books. The series should be read in order. The book begins with Free Bard Kestrel (a.k.a. Jonny Brede) and his wife, the gypsy Robin (a.k.a. Gwyna), traveling from Birnam in a gypsy wagon. The first half of the book takes them through a series of adventures that lead them to Gradford. The second half deals with events in Gradford, including the attempt of an evil priest to take over the city as a dictator (one can recognize the usual historical process of scapegoats, strong-arm police, a charismatic leader, etc.). It describes the strategies used by the general population to survive during such a reign, and has an eventual confrontation between good and evil. Overall, it is an entertaining book that holds your interest."
5,Probably most meaningful book written on AIDS in 20 years,Is AIDS really caused by a virus such as HIV? This book cuts to the heart of why after 20 years we still have no cure or vaccine for AIDS. It is a brilllantly witten expose of what is really behind AIDS. It's well-documented and riviting. I recommend it highly. In a historical context Dr. Broxmeyer makes his argument and then some.
5,Madama Butterfly,"Thank you to the knowledgeable reviewers of this CD for their 5 ***** recommendation. Scotto is remarkable and Barbirolli's sensitive interpretation is a joy. I have the De Los Angeles/Santini Butterfly CD, but it pales in comparison."
4,The Short Review's review of Mayor of the Roses by Marianne Villanueva,"Reviewed by Steven WingateThe voices of the worldwide colonialist diaspora have become the defining characteristic of our new millennium's literature; Marianne Villanueva's Mayor of the Roses, split between tales of the Philippines and the lives of Filipinos in America, makes a solid contribution to that ongoing literary stream.In these eighteen stories, Villanueva explores tropes of diasporic literature that will be familiar to readers of contemporary fiction: dislocation from tradition, assimilation into Western culture, fidelity to families left behind, etc. Though she does so ably and with verve, Villanueva is at her best when she digs beneath such tropes and serves us something more raw and elemental.....For the rest of the review, please visit: [...]"
5,Perfect Replacement,This is the perfect replacement. I need this because my old belt buckle broke. Thank god i didnt have to buy a whole nother accumold belt because they are EXPENSIVE
3,"This album is good, but depressing...",This album was made shortly after the break-up of Brian and his Ex-wife Deanna. You can literally hear the depression in the songs on the album and some songs are obviously dedicated to Deanna and Their son Dakota. This is a sad one.
2,Cologne Sample,The product was fine and authentic. But I didn't realize it would be a small sample of the type handed out in department stores.
3,could be better,This is a nice pit for packing a way. But it needs some sides on it to make it deeper so you can use the grate to cook on over the fire. So if you are looking to cook over a fire you will have to wait for some hot coals.
3,One frightened identity crisis,Still fun to watch despite the overly contrived plot. Some good old character actors running through this movie made it enjoyable and helped overcome any other shortcomings.
2,needs restoration,"""Fire Over England"" is a film classic but not this DVD. The sound is adequate but the picture quality is very poor. A pity."
2,Very Mediocre,"While this book was good enough to finish, it was nothing I would recommend to a friend. It was fairly transparent and predictable. The characters were a little one-dimensional and really not that interesting. It reminded me of the story about the Christmas box. A lot of sentimental, overly dramatic melodrama."
4,It is cute and heavy. Good for the money you paid!,"You have to put everything together to use it andyou have to take the top part off to put the paper towel in,which is harder than other paper towel holder.However, it is not a expensive item, I think it is good for what you paid!It matches everything in kitchen. I am happy with my purchase!"
5,country paper towel holder,"Old Dutch 051SR 2-Tone Rooster-Design Standing Paper-Towel Holder, Red. Very easy to assemble and use. This product is sturdy wrought iron material and adds some nostalgia to your kitchen if you love country motif... also check out the matching string holder...those are hard to find if you would love matching materials for your kitchen...I find it very handy and highly recommend."
2,paper towel holder,I was a little disapointed because when I opened the package under the rooster top was 2 small chips off the paint. I will have to find some paint to touch it up. I felt like it cost me a little more than I wanted to spend and now I have to fix it.
5,BEAUTIFUL,This is very pretty and heavy duty. I really like it. Easy to use and a pretty addition to my Rooster decor
2,rooster comes off,"I agree with review that states the roll is too tight and you have to manually unroll the towel. When you can unroll, the rooster unscrews and comes off and the metal screw also falls off. Chance of losing the screw. It goes beautifully with my kitchen and I am planning to order some of the matching accessories. I already have the trivette. Too bad the mechanics of the towel holder are not suitable for rolls of thicker more absorbent towels."
4,Cheerful little kitchen piece...does chip.,"We found this piece at a discount home store right after we moved. I fell in love with the color. It's a bright, shiny red and brightens up any kitchen. It did chip, though - only in the area by where you have to unscrew the rooster to change the paper towel roll, but still. Not a major issue, and I still love this item, but it happened pretty quickly."
4,Looks good...has issues,"Looks great, nice and heavy, excellent red color. Only problem is that once you screw the rooster back on after putting the paper towel roll on, it's almost too short and makes it hard for the roll to turn easily. The screw is metric of course...so waiting on the hubby to change that out wasn't going to fly with me, I added a washer or two on the bottom where the roll goes on and that seems to have helped."
1,It is too tight,"I love the look of this paper-towel holder, but it doesn't function very well. The space between the guide bar and the rod is too small for a full role of paper towels. I have to leave the rooster off the top until I have used at least 1/4 of the roll, otherwise I can't get the roll to turn & the towels won't come off."
5,Great Paper Towel Dispenser,I love this dispenser. It is heavy enough it does not fall when I reach for paper towels. The color red is perfect. I also got the matching napkin holder. They look GREAT together
2,"Not functional, but really pretty.","I'm not sure what they were thinking when they engineered this. To put a roll of paper towels on it you have to unscrew the rooster, ok not a huge deal, however you have to unscrew the rooster forever and the bottom will come unscrewed as well so the whole thing comes apart. Very cumbersome. The only reason I didn't give it one star is because it is such an attractive paper towel holder, also, we received it damaged. The cylinder under the rooster was badly chipped. Very disappointed."
4,A good guide to a complicated opening,"I got this book so that I could learn the Sicilian, and this book does an excellent job in teaching you the ideas behind it without massive amounts of the latest novelties. The text gives you as black specific moves to play in some ways like a repertoire book, but explains the idea behind the moves. After you learn these basics you could adopt different lines, such as the poisoned pawn variation. I have, however, had good luck learning the ideas behind this extremely powerful opening."
5,A true treat,This book just happened to be the first I read by the author and I fould it to be a wonderful novel. I couldn't put it down and I have no problem re-reading the novel when I happen to run into several other novels that were not with reading. I really hope anyone reading this review takes the time to read the novel and form their own opinion.
3,The reviews sound good ...BUT her WRITING STYLE...???,"I could not get pass the COMMAS and EXCLAMATION MARKS and the.......PERIODS!!! They were everywhere. So i skipped and skimmed and read some. Their phrases were so un-necessarily used the writing style could be a lot better.When you read a review on her stories they sound good but . Anyway I got another book (from the library of course!) ""Queen of Hearts"". I peeked through their and saw those ECCLAMATION MARKS and COMMAS EVERYWHERE. Anyone else notice that???? Hmmm..."
4,"OK, weakest of the ""Charley's Alphabet"" series","Following in the tradition of the previous Charley's Alphabet books, the illustrations in this book are vibrant and interesting, and the plot basic. In this book, little x runs off because he isn't used enough, and becomes a Xylophone player for a mean Capital M. The rest of the alphabet finds little x, rescues him, convinces Capital M that he should be nice, because don't we all love our Mothers, and they all fly back to help form a message on Charley's birthday cake for his Mother. Spoiler: little x gets used on a birthday cake to signify kisses. In short, there really wasn't enough plot to interest my almost 3 year old son past a few readings. And the ""let's all love our Mothers"" message was a bit sappy even for a preschooler."
5,Very cute Mom's Birthday Book,"I first got the book from the local library to read to my 2 1/2 yr. old grandson about the Alphabet. Very cute, Bought 2 for my grandchildren to give to their Mommy's for their birthdays."
5,Wonderful books,"My four year old loves all three books in this series. I had been working on his alphabet before I purchased these books. After reading these books night after night, it just clicked with him. He now knows all of his abc's. This one was my favorite."
5,Great Book!,"My son loves this book. He requests it every night for one of his bedtime books. He likes to search for little ""i""s missing dot. Plus, he likes pointing out all the letters. Great book overall."
2,TIME TO RETIRE A DEAD AUTHOR?,"As a long time Ludlum fan, I can't help but be disappointed by this book. The pace is erratic, the characters lackluster and the ending uninspired. I couldn't help but be reminded of the original Ludlum with that heart-pounding suspense when I read the recently published espionage novel by Ward Larsen, The Perfect Assassin. This is a book with an intelligent plot, incredible characters and a pace that really does keep you up at night. A lot like Tom Clancy but not with the interminable details."
1,Lost in the Thesaurus,"I have enjoyed all the Ludlum books over the years and even after his death, I still found the replacement writers have carried on his skills....UP TO NOW!!!This edition was a rambling stroll thru endless eruptions from a thesaurus that continuously injected wording that was so totally distracting that I lost interest in the storyline. I believe it is time for me to remove the Robert Ludlum series from my future interests."
2,What the Bloody Hell Happened?,"I'm a big fan of spy thrillers, so I was pretty excited to read this book by the famed Robert Ludlum... Boy, was I wrong. Spy thrillers have always had a strict formula to it, and the reader is expected to be taken on a rollercoaster ride. The characters were uninteresting, the story line was all over the board with no real connecting plots, and I figure out who the real assassin was halfway through the book... So long story short, save your money."
1,Dead Men Tell No Tales,"With so many authors out there, writing good books, it is a shame that people are being fed these Mcbooks...Ludlum and Harold Robbins are the worst case...of novels written by others, but using the originals name in order to merely make money. This book is a joke, an awful story part lame version of Borne Identity and part pulp. Awful."
1,Contemplative warning,"If I had $1.00 for every time I heard the words ""contemplative"" and ""visage"" on the ""Ambler Warning"" audio book I would be very wealthy! What an overuse of words! Listening for the redundancy of words was actually far more interesting than the contrived, lengthy, silly plot."
4,1st time reading a Robert Lundum book . . .,"I'm shocked by the other reviews! I enjoyed this book, although some of the writing was choppy and under-developed. Is it the best book I've ever read? NO! But was it entertaining and engaging? Yes!After reading the other reviews, I plan to read other books by this author... I'll be interested to see if there truly is a difference."
2,The Ambler Warning,"The plot of the story is Ludlum all the way, but the narrative is no where near Ludlum. I am having a hard time getting through it. Will probably give up before half way."
2,the first half was good,"I wish I would've read the reviews before I got this book. First I did not realize this author is dead. I do not that Ludlum has some good books, so I will go look for some of his older novels.The first part of this book was awesome. Than it dragged and dragged and dragged. I knew who the real killer was and was not surprised by the ending. Also, some of the story line was so confusing, or maybe I was just bored."
1,"Not just rolling, but spinning! in his grave","I'm a person who, once I've begun a book, keeps thinking it's going to get better so I tend not to give up...but I skipped most of the last 1/3 of this mess without losing the drift and by the time I put it down wished I'd never picked it up.The author should be ashamed and so should the decision makers for the Ludlum Estate to have perpertrated such a fraud on Mr. Ludlum's fans. The glaring errors in the first fifty or sixty pages are enough to make the whole plot suspect and the author, whomever he/she may be, uses the word 'madness' so many times the reader begins to cringe at it's appearance.The 'surprise' ending is predictable, the character(s) is unsympathetic and there are so many bad guys and agencies involved, I lost track of who/which was who/which.Don't waste your time...find a new (living) author!"
1,Shameful,"Publishing this book was a shameful marketing attempt to cash in on Robert Ludlum's name. This unsatisfying book was very boring and left many loose ends, certainly nowhere near the exceptional writing and high standards of the legendary Ludlum."
3,Ambler Warning has weak ending,"This posthumously published book of Ludlum is interesting andkeeps you turning the pages, but the ending is weak and entirelyunbelievable. I don't know who thought this would work, but turningthe entire story on its head to make a ""surprise ending"" really doesn'tdo the truck."
2,Farfetched even for a novel of intrigue,"I stopped reading Ludlum stories years ago, as I found his books to be so similar to each other as to make them boring. I also had to deal with a regular feeling of deja vu... didn't I read this passage before, or, this setting or person seems familiar.Those issues did not creep into my reading of this book with great frequency, most likely because I kept thinking, ""There is NO way he'll get out of this"" or ""That would never happen."" I realize that reading a good novel, and especially a ""spy"" novel requires a fair amount of suspension of belief. However, this one passed those limits."
3,AMBLER- WARNING FOR BOREDOM!,"A POOR REWRITE OF THE BOURNE IDENTITY, ABOUT A TRAINED ASSASSIN TRYING HOPELESSLY TO FIND OUT ABOUT HIS PAST, WHILE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES FROM AROUND THE WORLD HAVE HIM TARGETED FOR ASSASSINATION.A BORING SECONDARY CHARACTER ON THE HUNT FOR HAL AMBLER, POOR DIALAGUE, FORMALAIC STORY LINE, AND TERRIBLY DESCRIBED ACTION SCENES MAKE FOR A SECOND RATE NOVEL AT BEST!THIS NOVEL IS WHY MOST AUTHORS FINISH THEIR WRITING CAREERS AT DEATH!A PISSPOOR RENDITION OF LUDLUM'S EARLIER NOVELS, WITHOUT THE DESCRIPTIVE ABILITIES, OR THE INSPIRATION THAT MADE HIM FAMOUS!A C+ AT BEST!"
1,FRAUD!,"The publisher, St. Martin's Press, oughta be indicted. Secreted inside the book is the info that Ludlum is dead and they've dug up someone called Myn Pyn, who I suspect just graduated from a third-rate writing school. He/she glories in long, boring paragraphs and obscure words that had me scampering to Webster's. May we hope St. Martin's Press will issue a call back and refund our money? Hah!"
1,Not Even Close To Ludlum,"What a disgrace to Robert Ludlum. As a faithful reader of all of his works, I am used to starting a Ludlum thriller and hardly putting it down until completed. Against my better judgement, I purchased The Ambler Warning with the hope that the ""ghost writer"" could even come close to Ludlum.What a huge disappointment.I could not get through the first fifty pages before I realized that the Warning in the title was, ""This book is terrible""What a shame for readers that have not previously read and enjoyed a true Ludlum book. They will be completely turned off by this pitiful effort that bares his name. Obviously the estate thinks more of the money than his name."
2,2 1/2 stars,"Whoever is writing these novels under the Robert Ludlum name is not doing him justice. Stop while the Ludlum name still means something. I thought this novel to be both dry and convoluted. I struggled through most of it. There's a reason that whoever wrote this didn't put their name to it. Ludlums 'Covert One' novels, written by Patrick Larkin, are far superior."
2,"Interesting concept, but way too long and rambling","If you're looking for a thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat, this isn't it. If you're looking for hours of imaginary political diatribe interspersed with what could have been a good thriller, you've found it.I listened to the audiobook version of this on some scratched CD's and found myself being pleased when the CD's skipped, just so I could get through this long-winded book quicker. This would be a great candidate for a Reader's Digest Condensed book, simply because they could remove all the irrelevant political diatribe about imaginary people in imaginary governments that don't matter to the story anyway, and have a nice short story.Very long, and about 75% of the book is totally irrelevant to the story."
2,"well-written, with a bad ending","As I read this book, I couldn't figure out how it could possibly have a good ending - and I was right. I won't recap the plot, others have done that, but the epilog that tried to make everything end nicely felt forced and wasn't true to the rest of the story. New facts were introduced to make it seem ok, but there was very little groundwork laid in the actual story to support it. The Bourne Identity did something similar, but did it much better. I'd have preferred a less happy but more honest ending (like the one Kyle Mills did in his book FADE)."
1,"Worst ""Ludlum"" I've Read","I typically love Ludlum books, but as some of the other reviews indicate this book was written by somebody else(who they don't even care to identify). If you want a good Ludlum, look for one that he actually wrote."
2,Bourne Lite,"If you don't know by now, Robert Ludlum is essentially a Trademark. The poor guy has long passed and the books keep churning out by ghost writers. Some are good...and some not so much. This is one of the not so much variety.This story tries unsuccessfully to recreate the basic Bourne concept. A super-duper spy guy assassin with memory loss. He's not sure who the real person inside him is. Past that, it's standard spy fare. Big conspiracy plot, corrupt government officials, and other spy template stuff. I was able to finish it, but could see the big plot twist coming a mile away. It would've been better to go re-read one of the Bourne trilogy."
2,Disappointing,"Disappointing book. I've like many of Ludlum's books over the years but this one isn't very good. It begins similarly to the Bourne Identity but instead of waking up on a beach without knowing what has happened Hal Ambler wakes up in a psyche hospital. At times the writing is exciting but then it just slows and is downright boring. I stuck with it and had it ""figured out"" early on. I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Disappointment,"Not being aware that Mr. Ludlum had passed away, I eagerly purchased this book. What a disappointment! It's a shame to carry on his name in this fashion.In my opinion, the book was quite amateurish, slow and wordy for wordiness' sake (case in point - the meeting in the airport with the guy using (too many!) fractured idioms, e.g., ""kill two fowl with one rock"", ""birds of the same plumage seek out one another's company"", ""all that coruscates (coruscates???) is not gold."") Also, as someone else mentioned, the editing seemed lacking (the gun that was seen beneath a bush, highly accessible, then later is was ""completely inaccessible"").I won't make the mistake again - there are much better choices around."
2,I didn't really like this,"The themes in this story were SO repetitive - I get it already! And there were so many details, they bogged the story down. I found myself skimming in lots of places, and don't feel like I missed anything."
5,Awesome!,"Lets start with the essentials then, firstly the material is good stong yet lightweight, the design is of a good quality, not iron on tranfers or any of that rubbish, and the style!!!! THE STYLE!!! the amount of attention you get with this shirt is immense, and its always positive, Well worth buying :)"
3,packaging flaw...,"so, I read online that this mask was amazing. it may well be, if I could just get it to come out of the package correctly. maybe my packaging was just flawed, but i couldnt get the outer goop to come out.i didnt think it was that great, but maybe that was because i didnt have the correct mixture...oh well."
4,"No illusions, but still alive","Poland in the 60's.Characters drawned as with no illusions, a boy always drunken not to remember the present and the lack of love and understanding, his sister the only one who has sparkles of faith in the possibilities of humane changes, but at the end breaks down. On the background the system, the lack of morality that becames going over morality and only a try in surviving, no hope in joy. Everything seems to collapse, but at last Poland will remain the same, forever, for only humane beings will fall in dust, the spirit of the country'll remain the same, stifling and atrophying. The country survives because feeds on his inhabithans, on their blood and hopes.Hlasko recreates the disillusion himself lived, and died too early to realize that was right in his prophecy."
1,"Bad, bad, bad.","Gives a bad name for noir comics. Dialog is terrible, plotline is a weak rip-off of ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly,"" and the art is unimaginative and bland.Even the characters are unlovable, I thought I liked Jinx until I realized she is a whiny, two-dimensional femme-fatal wanna-be.Go pick up ""The Hard Good-Bye"" instead."
4,Charming (if dated) early work from Bendis,"Jinx is very early Bendis (anyone remember 1997?), both illustrated and written by Marvel's latest flagship writer. Jinx tells the parallel stories of a down-on-his-luck con man and a female bounty hunter (the title character). Their paths coincide in a few places, and, at the close of this first volume, it looks like they'll go on to many merry adventures. Jinx is a nice little indy - the protagonists (even the foul 'friend') are all entertaining and surprisingly engaging characters.It feels more than a little dated - like a combination of Swingers and Out of Sight - but pulls it off with great charm. I'm not sad that Bendis decided to concentrate on his writing - Jinx has great visual style, but isn't groundbreaking as much as 'aggressively independent'. Nice for a break, but hard for a series."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Jinx is one of those crime caper stories. Dodgy characters abound. In fact, the three main characters are dodgy. A con artist dodgy type, a bounty hounter dodgy type, and an annoying dodgy type are what we are presented with.when the possibility of obtaining a whole lot of loot brings some of them together, violence and the usual follow."
3,Hawkwind - 'It Is The Business Of The Future....' (Griffin),"Released,at least in the U.S. in 1993.'It Is the Business...' has the long running UK space rock ensemble trying to combine elements of ambient as well as techno into their trademark style.Not as good as 1992's 'Electric Teepee',but that would be a tough one to beat anyway.Somewhat of a new ground for Hawkwind,but not THAT new.Some of the decent tunes here are the eleven minute epic ""Space Is Their Palestine""(a good number when they play it live),the somewhat progressive-like ""Techno Tropic Zone"",""Let Sleeping Dogs Lie"" and their Stones cover ""Gimme Shelter"".Has Hawkwind done many covers,at least on an actual album?The line-up here is strictly a trio:Brock,Alan Davey and drummer Richard Chadwick.A nice addition to anyone's Hawkwind collection."
4,great space jams a la electric teepee,"throbbing synth and bass lines without much vocals. ""the camera that could lie (remake of ""living on the knife edge)"" has a funky reggae thing to it which is refreshing, ""psycho-tropic zone,"" is as bizarre and great as it sound. Al Davey notches up a vocal in a kick *** remake of the Stones ""gimme shelter."" Pretty darn good stuff."
4,"For the price, the Dove Sensitive Skin Beauty ...","For the price, the Dove Sensitive Skin Beauty Bar is a good deal. People with allergies might want to stick to a more anti-allergy specific soap. But if you're just looking for a regular soap, this bar is good because it doesn't leave behind that irritating bar soap smell."
3,The soap has a very nice lather. My ...,"The soap has a very nice lather. My problem with the soap is that I like my soap to have a pleasing smell. This soap pretty much has no smell to it! If that is what you're looking for, then this is your soap."
2,Dried me out,"I was hoping this soap would work for my dry, itchy skin due to the 1/4 moisturizers, but it pretty much dried my skin out like any regular bar of soap. For the claims & the price, my experience = a rip off. I really wanted to like this soap . . . sadly I don't because it strips my skin of the little moisture it already has. Not too fond of the smell either. The lather is good though."
4,Pretty good results,"I think the directions are a little off on this product as it suggests 5g/day for an adult, but this can produce some mild cramping. 2.5g is more than enough for an average bodybuilder and it has been suggested by professionals that 1g/100 lb bodyweight is what the body can absorb and utilize."
4,Works well and at a good price.,"So far it's worked well for me. During the first cycle I've seen a bench increase from around 240 up to 265. Granted I did go from using a standard barbell (1"") to an olympic set-up which seems to be better balanced. My one complaint is that the powder tends to head straight for the bottom of the glass or container that it's put in. It seems best to use a small amount of water or juice to down the powder and then follow-up with any additonal water or juice as you so chose."
5,One of the best out there!,"Got a 2 pack for the price of one on these. Creatine Monohydrate has been shown to be the most effective form out there. However that doesn't mean all monohydrates are created equal. You need to ensure you get a good quality one, such as this that uses the German grade Creapure."
2,"For me, just a terrible product.","I am not new to creatine usage. I've used Jack 3d for almost a year now for atleaste 5 times a week. Never had any side effects and always feel very energetic when it starts kicking in. On top of that, they have a taste that everyone can handle.However, I cannot say the same for this Universal product. The taste is just awful, it taste just like the powders in pills.. VERY bitter. Also, I've tried 3,2, and 1 scoops, I felt no energy and it leaves me nauseated. I had a very hard time working out with it because me really makes me to NOT want to workout at all.Its just a bad product. Sure you get more for your money, but whats the point when this product doesn't even work and sets you back? Very disappointed."
3,Common sense...,"I would give this book 2.5 stars. If I lose my common sense, then at least I know have some aspects of it written down...phew! For example there was a walk discussed to help you blow off some steam. Duh!! If you're upset then of course an option is to go for a walk. I can't remember what I paid as I was in the mood to do reviews today but as I think about it, this book is worth $1 or $2."
4,Haunting,"A dreamy affair, this book traverses the boundary between reality and the hyper-real with breathtaking skill. The storylines are often unimportant, taking a back seat to the prose, which flows and twists with great dexterity and poetry. This is a strongly visual book that would certainly appeal to readers of all ages. It would be of particular interest to those with a predilection towards fantasy. There is a strong thematic of family bonds throughout, and though no time period is mentioned, the nature of the writing and storytelling (strong family themes, the near absence of any technology) gives me the impression that most of the stories are set in the distant past, which only adds to the otherworldly qualities. I like the title as well because blackness is a strong image created throughout, almost like the book is an anthology of stories from the dark ages."
3,Very Interesting but Dark,"I had to purchase this book for a Young Adult Literature course. Initially I thought I wouldn't be able to enjoy it but once you get used to the thick dialect and the dark nature of the authors work it's really quite interesting. It is a compilation of short stories. They are not themed with each other at all but they all have a continuity of strange perspective, dark humor, very difficult dialect, and characterizations that resemble Edgar Allen Poe's works. If you wind up having to buy it, don't fear it."
3,Black Juice review,"This book was evil and we can all relate to at least one of these stories. It was ten twisted tales about, in my pespective, life. They were sad and scary stories, each one of them had a very distinct story line. I suggest this book to teens over the age of twelve and all others who understand it."
5,Haunting Tales,"The stories in this book are all beautiful and haunting. They are set in a variety of locations that may or may not be real, and they deftly combine everyday emotions with elements of the fantastic or surreal. These are the sort of stories you remember long after you have read them."
5,Very Creative!,"As an amateur collector, I found this book very interesting and helpful. Not only can collecting be a challenge, but so can incorporating vintage clothes in with your everyday wardrobe. Tiffany Dubin's sense of style is creative as well as wearable. She illustrates her ideas through colorful pictures and descriptions of real women in realistic settings. You feel like you're getting sincere, up-to-date advise from someone who knows vintage intstead of learning from someone designing for Kate Moss."
3,Was hoping for a more complete guide of vintage designerss,"I was hoping that this book would provide a more complete tour of vintage design through the past century. I would have liked this book to have been a vintage clothing guide of each decade's popular designers, along with information on how to spot the unique style of each. There was some information given by decade, but it was somewhat incomplete for my needs. Also, I would have liked to have seen more information on shoes and purses, with detailed tips on how to spot quality pieces."
1,wtf?,"Received this as a gift and wasn't impressed. About 99% of the styles are tacky and tasteless. Many of the styles in the pics weren't even vintage and if they were it was really hard to tell. I was looking for a book that could give me some tips for vintage, or even at least vintage modern style but this book wasn't usefel at all and I wonder why it's still even in my closet."
1,"Pretencious, Pretencious, and More Pretencious","This book is hysterical!1. The pictures: Tragic, to say the least. I found the photo of HAmish BOwles on a Zebra-skin rug to be utterly appalling. This book really does a disservice to the fashion industry as a whole. Not only that, the tips are verbatum from another book that I purchased 6 years ago. I think Miss Dubin should find a new study, for this is not her forte. I feel that this book was a big waste of money. If you are truly a collector or you love vintage this book is not for you.The only good thing; it makes a great coaster."
5,Bizet's Pearl Fishers Opera,"It's well done in every respect...the singing, orchestral accompaniment, jewel case cover etc. We're very pleased we ordered it."
5,Wonderful piece of work,"This wonderful piece of work by Bizet is not as popular as Carmen, and this is a pity, for the melodies and voice registers used by the composers are really talking to the soul. This version, although not recent, is the best I know by the quality of performers and sound recording. Definitely worth buying."
5,Great!,We bought this for our 3 year old daughter for christmas.. she loves it! It is very good quality!She uses it everyday.
4,Beautiful piece,"Great piece of furniture! I wanted something sturdy and I knew kidkraft was the way to go. My husband had no problems putting it together, and my little girl loves it!"
5,Lovely,"A lovely piece of furniture, I'm sure this will last for years. Very sturdy. Exactly what I wanted! So pretty"
5,Very Cute!,"I bought this for my 5 year old and she loves it. It is pretty sturdy, a nice quiality, and excellent customer service. I did have a problem that KidKraft quickly resolved. The box didn't come with the mirror. I called KidKraft and they shipped it out next day air and the vanity was finally complete. Accidents happen, and KidKraft did resolve the issue perfectly."
4,Cutest vanity for a mini diva,"This vanity set arrived quickly and was very easy to assemble. The instructions are very simple and once assembled, it looks exactly as represented in the photo. It would be great if the stool was padded; but overall it is a good piece of furniture."
5,FINALLY FOUND IT!!,"I've finally found the special DVD edition for this movie!! I havent seen it yet, but nevertheless my hometown(charleston missouri) is where the movie was filmed.. my uncle claims he was an extra in the film so im excited on finally getting a copy, but i must say its a tad bit weird to have Corman direct a film in my hometown and i cant wait to hear the reason why.."
3,The Intruder,"Adam Cramer arrives in a southern town with one purpose in mind, to gather the white residents to rally against forced school integration. The white residents seem resigned to the fact that 10 Black students will be attending the local school, but Cramer is determined to change that. Once he starts to stir things up, his efforts snowball and the viewer can see how this will likely end.Watching this film reminds me of how much things have changed and how much they've remained the same. I must admit, I chuckled when 'Captain Kirk' and 'Katherine Chancellor' were having an intimate moment. I found this to be one of those films that did a decent job of exploring racism in the south, but the ending is highly unbelievable."
4,Corman Gets Serious,"Anyone who says Roger Corman only makes crap or William Shatner can't act needs to see this movie. Shatner, in a smoldering performance of terrifying menace, plays a charismatic bigot who arrives in a small town in America's Deep South to fan the flames of hatred as schools are being integrated. Being filmed on location in 1961 as these things were actually going on and using actual townspeople as extras and secondary characters lend this film a chilling, uncomfortable verisimilitude unlike any other film I've seen on the subject of racism. On top of that, the writing is razor-sharp and the ending is intriguingly ambiguous."
5,Shatner's Finest Hour!,William Shatner's most powerful and nuanced performance. His character is the personification of evil. A must see!
4,Sweet Game!,"06 is so much better than the original version, because its made by a different developer. I haven't even started playing season mode yet because the new 3-on-3 mode is so addicting! I basically play as (in my case) forsberg, gagne, and knuble vs any other team's top 3 players. It's so fun! The controls are a lot better, and its easier to shoot one timers unlike the old version. The only negative for me is that it doesnt have most of the rookies on it, it has them on there but it doesnt have their name. For example, it says: ""Rookie, R."" for Sidney Crosby and the same for the Flyers' Jeff Carter or Mike Richards- i dont know which one because it only has one rookie not two, so one is missing. I would buy it if you really like hockey, cuz its fun."
1,This game is a No-No,"The developers didn't do a good job at all.The graphics is sloppy and slow. I've been playing hockey games since EA's NHL 94 and this pretty much bring me back to that time.Don't waste your money on this game, no matter how much of a hockey fan you are."
4,ITS OKAY,I got this game today and played it on my psp and this is what I noticed... well its not good or bad. It is a very fast passed game. Graphics arnt the best either. I hope that ea sports makes a hockey game for the psp one day because these gretzky games arent that good. overall its okay
4,Geared for classical mechanics,"Good books on the calculus of variations are not thick on the ground, and this one is pretty good. It is organised around explicating Hamiltonian mechanics, but with mathematical rigor and clarity. Why not 5 stars then? Some proofs skip a lot of steps. There are not a lot of examples. The typesetting is from 509 years ago, with equations and so on in the text not on a separate line. There are few diagrams.If your interest is in physics this is a FAR better book to choose than Sagan."
4,Hex Love,This game is based on a turn-based hex system. This means that each space you move your unit is one hex. The game offers a variety of different weapon combinations that can be put on each unit (herc) along with different pilots with different skills. For a game made back in the 90's it has a lot of charm and replayability.
1,1965 ford ranchero gas tank,"they sent me a mustang tank and the gas tank I ordered for my 1965 for ranchero ,,,,, I am madd as hell"
2,Stale Stale Stale,"Order arrived promptly via Amazon Prime, but the Happy Colas were very stale. The gummies in every pack were hard as rocks. Ordered Gold Bears as well. Gold Bears were fresh. Better quality control is necessary."
4,Yummy for the whole family.,"This has been a surprising taste treat for our whole family. While I don't think these taste like something similar I remember eating a few years ago (but who can trust that kind of memory?), I do think they are really good. And so does my husband and 3 kids! Very good product."
2,Cola?,"I didn't think it tasted very much like cola, rather, it tasted like some type of fruit. It was harder than I expected too."
2,I don't know what all the fuss is about...,These are ok. The best way to describe the taste is that they taste like pepsi cola that's gone flat. They're not terrible but they also aren't that great.
3,Not as gummi as other brands,I love gummi coke bottles and prefer them over choclate. I have always got mine in bulk from a store called Henry's which recently stopped selling them. So I tried the Haribo and was very disappointed in the several bags I have tried. The candy was stiff and actually required severe chewing to the point that my jaw got tired. The taste was there it just was not as soft as other brands and there was no way you could pull a bottle apart with your hands like other brands I have tried.
1,4-Pc Casserile Set - Shadow Iris,Not at all happy with the packing of this casserole set. First two shipments had chipped lid handles. Third set was so tightly packed that it fell out on floor and shattered largest bowl. This set has since been discontinued by Amazon and we received a refund. Corelle needs to learn how to pack this so that the lid handles will not chip.
1,PACKAGED POORLY!,"I was just going to return it and ask for another set to be sent to me, but when my husband saw it arrive at our house in so many pieces because it was packaged so poorly...he said to just ask for a refund. Too bad, I really could have used it too."
1,OOPS,Product arrived broken .Returned for a refund. I did not re-order.It was not packed very well at all.
5,Iris accents Ultra,I have the square Ultra Corelle dishes and when I saw the Iris pattern decided to use them as accents. Not long after getting the casserole bake and serve set I ordered the suger/creamer salt/pepper sets and again later another casserole set and the ramikins. Makes setting the table such a pleasure!
3,Nice set but beware of packing!,"This order sat in backorder for months (not Amazon's fault) and when I finally received it, one of the lids was broken. Each of the next THREE sets they sent was packed the same way (top and all sides well packed, NO packing on the bottom) and arrived partially broken. Amazon customer service was great, as always, no argument and no request to return due to the danger of broken glass; but I was never able to get the message across about the packing. The last set arrived with NO packing (set #4) and every piece broken. They now say they won't send another and refunded my money. I ended up with 2 small casseroles with lids and one large casserole with no lid. I'd still prefer to have one of each with lids, but it won't turn me off to being an Amazon customer...nobody does a perfect job and they are still pretty good."
3,Poor packing,"The item is good, but the packing from Amazon is hopeless for there are no protective thermocol bubbles.Its just a usual box and results in most of the pieces being broken(see other reviews). Amazon can concentrate on the shipping too !!!"
1,Broken Cookware on Arrival!,"Amazon's great for books, DVDs, and CDs. Do NOT order breakables. It arrived in pieces. I did receive a free return label but what a waste of energy and time!"
3,more like 3.5 star...,"Not worth all the hype it gets but nonetheless a good album. My qualms are mostly with the production and the lack of chemestry between the band on some songs (problems that got fixed on 'tear from the red). This album will stink once you've heard tear from the red, but it is really a shadow of what these guys are capable of. Go out and get it, cause it aint half bad!"
5,Pre-Metalcore,"I'm sick of people dissing this cd because of the ''lyrics'' there's absolutely nothing wrong with the lyrics, they aren't sappy...so shut up. I really like the drums and guitars on this cd. My favorite Poison the Well song is definitely ""Slice Paper Wrists"". It's got everything that I love about metalcore...screaming vocals, some clean vocals...a nice heavy palm muted closing riff....so everyone shutup, poison the well is awesome, people are way too critical with their metal, yes, i listen to Shadows Fall and they are my favorite thrash metal band, but does that mean that I abosutely cannot listen to bands like this...hell no, and I do listen to bands like Poison the Well, As I Lay Dying(who actually is metalcore...THEY ARE NOT EMO!), Unearth, kickass seven strings, KsE too, f*#$! all you people that dis them, so what if almost all their songs have the same structure, still kickass metal, listen to these guys for the music...stop bitching about the vocals, Poison the Well kicks ass!"
2,"Good, but monotonous","This cd has some great moments in it, but the relentless sameness of it can be a bit numbing. I'm sure that a lot of people love albums that are nothing but loud, indecipherable screaming, but I'm not one of those people. If you actually like some semblance of a discernable melody with your music, then look somewhere else. Also, all of the songs are extremely short. The average length of any of the songs is about 2 minutes and 30 seconds. The longest track is less than four minutes. So you're really not even getting a half an hour of music. Only buy this cd if you're just really into this kind of stuff. This is definitely a ""special interest"" band."
1,mediocre metal/hardcore,"I was thoroughly dissapointed when I first listened to this album. Despite some desperate attempts, poisin the well fails to come anywhere close to being, or even sounding emo. This band could take a serious lesson or two from bands such as sleepytime trio or planes mistaken for stars. I consider this album a mediocre metal album at best."
5,A South Florida band perfectly mixes emotions and hardcore.,"A powerful mix of emotions into a blend of music that emotions need to be found more. Poison the Well has gone through many changes in its past, but found their exact match when they found lead singer Jeffery. He brings his emotions and voice into the whirlpool of guitars and fast beating drums making this EP a heart beating masterpeice."
5,"Just as good, if not better, than the last album","I never had a whole lot of time with the 8-bit generation, but I know how great Mega Man, Super Mario Bros., and Contra are. The music to these games are more memorable than anything today (maybe because they repeated to infinity). While the titles on this album are much more obscure, they still sound just as great as any Super Mario Bros. theme. And really, you don't need to have even played the games in order to appreciate the covers present here. To the untrained ears this sounds like a great indie rock band, but you do get a sort of feeling hearing a song from your childhood.So, in short, while the titles on the last album were more varied, this CD is no sloppy sophomore (or however that expression goes)."
1,plagiarism,"This is a horrible little book that borrows material liberally from Cooperative Extension bulletins from Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. You would be far better off to purchase or download the original materials from the websites of these states than to purchase this book if for no other reason that the Cooperative Extension Bulletins are updated regularly while this book is now horribly out of date."
5,love the movie but this DVD does not work,load into Sony blue ray player and get weird menu..not movie...try on another and works...whoever transfered movie to disc was an Idiot...well after finding out my blue ray player was going bad...movie was fine..so I am the idiot...great movie great transfer...ty for selling
2,Broderick murdered this movie,"Francis Veber is one of the most popular frnch director. A lot of US movies were an adaptation of the french ones( three fugitives, the birdcage,father's day,la chèvre and soon le diner de con). ""Out on a limb"" was his first movie in USA and Matthew Boderick destroyed it. Even in France, it's quasi impossible to find this movie. The only reason to watch it is Jeffrey Jones."
5,Best so far,"The best kilted Santa I have found so far for my collection and with the wind up music box in it is a great bonus. I just wish it played something more holiday traditional. I bought this item a few years ago from Amazon when my sister had a kilted Santa that she bought in Scotland and I just had to have one. I love kilts and I wear them myself, so this was one of those ""niche"" items I had to collect.The item is well constructed as you would expect from Fabriche. It plays a music box version of LOCH LOMAND. It is hand painted and the fabric has some nice give. It's not stiff. One complaint would be that because of the staff, it's a little off center, so you'll want to put it on a nice sturdy stand, not on something that shakes or is wobbly."
2,davidoff cool water,my wife really did not like it on me. I have worn Sante Fe since we have been marriedand I am afraid she will not accept anything else.
4,Hilariously troubled journey through Madagascar.,"The author and her 14-year old daughter Rachel travel through Madagascar, (an island off the coast of East Africa), on foot, hitchhiking, by bus and by taxi. The unusual number of misfortunes besetting them had me hold my stomach with laughter, or cover my mouth in fear. -- Dervla Addict."
4,Very Entertaining,"Super travel book about a little known island. The author is a veteran Irish travel writer who takes her teenage daughter on a hiking trip across Madagascar. This book is simply loaded with all kinds of interesting history and lore. Excellent travel writing, bibliography, map, loved it."
1,not as shown,"should have read the reviews before I ordered. Needed 4 inch drop, recieved 3 1/2. I hate when company's cant advertise correctly"
1,Product received is not what is described.,This is described as having a 4 inch drop. It does not.The picture and description are different from what you get.What you get has a 3 1/2 inch drop as it clearly states on the label.If the description had been accurate I would not have bought this item.What you receive has a different model number than that which is in description. Amazon charged me for one model number and sent me an incorrect and cheaper model number. I did not get what I paid for.
3,Mis-labled on Amazon,"The product received is fine, and I'm using it.... but it is not what was described on the product page, as it does not have the easy-tighten locking notch thingy. Again, I don't care, as I've gone my whole life without that on my hitches. But still...not as advertised."
3,"If it's so bad, why am I still reading it?","Another example of psycho-fi - characterized by unpleasant characters, ruthless power plays and rampant paranoia. Superior practicioners of this flavor of sci-fi include Frank Herbert and CJ Cherryh. Wingrove has penned a compelling saga weakened by a lack of endearing characters - at least any that live very long. Maybe that's just an honest reflection of the rather vicious society he creates - where good guys die young (and painfully) while slavery, racism, brutality, incest, pedophilia, treachery, and murder abound. If, like me, you prefer stories that give you someone to identify with, this one's going to be tough going. And yet it's intriguing - and I'm still reading."
4,High quality and work great,"Cleavage Cupcakes are silicone implants that you simply pop into the bottom, outside of your brassiere to provide some extra cleavage and size. Even better than a padded bra, CCs have a warm feeling that makes for comfortable all-day wear, and will pass for natural during a hug. They are excellent for when you are wearing a low-cut dress, and wish you had just a little more to show off.Admittedly, these aren't cheap, but they are high quality and work great. If you are not always pleased with your bust, then get Cleavage Cupcakes, they work wonders.(Review of Cleavage Cupcakes)"
2,"Pleasent, but . . .","This is a nice cd of Christmas songs that has a very strong Christian element. The non-traditional Christmas songs start out well but don't seem to go anywhere and just sound repetitious. The best part to me were the two medleys of traditional Christmas songs. Ms. Patti (Patty?)'s voice and technique always reminded me of other singers, they didn't sound unique. Unless you particularly want Christian songs, I cannot recommend this cd as more than nice. Onward with the quest to add new Christmas cds to the small collection of gems I've located over the years."
5,Great All-Purpose Face Cream,"This product is a great all-purpose face cream to remove makeup, moisturize, cleanse, etc. I don't go a day without it."
3,Works Alright,"The price is reasonable in which I purchased mine for about $3 and still have a lot left over. This is recommended more as a cleanser/ make up remover. I suggest putting very little on since I find it greasy and then just gently rub off the make up, which is pretty easy to do and to clean off with wet tissue just as long as there isn't too much of it. The smell however, is very strong. Some people may like it so it all depends whether it is the right one for you or not. Overall though, it is effective and does moisturize your face once you wash it off."
2,Maybe good for new patients?,"I might have found this book to be a useful reference, had sleep apnea been new to me. Having advanced questions, I felt disappointed. I failed to note that the author has written Official Sourcebooks about a remarkable variety of disorders. I would prefer a book by a physician. The reader might do as well with a web search."
3,Only 1/2 good!!,"I must say I was really excited about receiving this cd, according to the reviews. Unfortunately I was somewhat dissapointed, while disc 1 gives you garden variety of cool house tracks with awesome hooks, track 5 especially is my favorite and is mixed extremely well and can definitely get you in the mood to go out on the town. However disc 2 is really annoying, it's too circuit sounding with too many obnoxious vocals. Every song has some oversung vocal and it's almost gospel sounding, if you like extra soulful all vocal house and you wanna feel like your sitting in a church choir then disc 2 is for you. Don't get me wrong I love vocals but this is overkill!!, it just didn't seem to fit with the theme of ""Bargrooves"" more like ""Soul glow Grooves"". Anyway, disc 1 is a keeper but disc 2 can stay in the sleeve."
5,8 LETTERS 3 WORDS,all i can say is that this cd builds on the legacy of the bargrooves product. i love 8 letters 3 words is my flagship trak on this cd. class sofistication confidence are what i got from that song. the cd is great for my driving working out or just chillin 2 the crib. a must buypeace 2 allpapi
2,i agree too much cheesy vocals .....on this on,i have been seeing the track contain go down hill with every new 2 cd collection ....what happen? only maybe 3 tracks good with the rest stuff that not hot ? bargrooves what's up???
2,"A crappy 70's version of ""You got served""","Now, I may not be the best critic in the world, but i've seen better movies than this while having a bowel movement. I love Bow wow very much but WHAT THE HELL WAS THIS??? you could tell that a white man wrote this s***. The music was great but that was it. These boys, Nick cannon, Bow wow and all the other little boys did not know what went on in the 70's and neither did the director. It wasn't funny and the skate moves were so wack.Bow wow looks like a monkey with all of his hair cut off, Nick cannon looks like a played-out pimp with his ""Stylish outfit"" Mike epps just looks freaky and Charlie Murphy needs to take his dark ass to a tanning salon. He get tanned so bad that he'll end up white (just joking).If you didn't see it already, don't see it. You'd have more fun watching a sidney Poiter film if you must see a 70's movie.Any way, Bow wow isn't a good actor. he should stick with singing before he gets booed off the stage for his crappy work."
4,Great flick,"If you grew up in the 70s/80s with nothing but some skates, bad fashion sense, and a yen to be the coolest kid at the rink, this flick is for you. Great music, great skating, great story."
4,Roll Bounce inspiring and funny with a little heart,So I had just see the trailer and then I decided to buy it (advise to watch the trailer on any movie you think of getting)I love to skate weekly and that made me want to buy this DVD initially...So about the movie:It is inspiring because it makes you want to get better with doing fun things on skates ;)But for people how don't skate but just like fun movies or/and dance movies this will make you laugh I'm sure even though it has some sadness in it too.It has some extra futures on the DVD that I always welcome! Sadly enough not to much on the skating it self.Oh and the deleted scenes are pretty good and some super funny.I give it a 4 out of 5 because I don't give to 5 that easly
2,Roll what?,"Samuel L. Jackson was simply at his worst in this movie. I don't know who thought he'd be good as shaft, because he really wasn't that great. the only reason i even gave shaft 2 stars is because of the action sequence in the car. Nobody told me that madonna was in this movie... what a surprise!!nevertheless, the movie was entertaining, but not that great. if nothing else, you'll be singing the shaft song afterwards."
4,Bouncy!,"Ok I hate to admit it but I kinda liked it. I was annoyed that it took half of the movie to get to the really good skating, but all in all I would say this is a remake of ""You Got Served"" only with Better actors/acting, and a better story line."
4,Lots of Fun,"I love movies like this, where the main purpose of the movie is to just entertain. The plot is simple, but it works. You basically go through the life of Bow Wow's character from the point where his favorite skating place is closed down...and through the moments where he and his fellow friends get ready for a competition against the baddest (meaning good) skaters within the chicago area.This movie brought back some old memories and the comraderie between bow wow and his friends are quite enjoyable to watch.i was also pleasantly surprised by the fact that Bow Wow didn't annoy me in this movie because I fully expected him to. He's no oscar-ready actor, but he was a 100 times better than i would have ever imagined him to be.The movie is alot of fun to watch and it's very family/kid friendly. I'll definitely buy this one and can't wait to watch it over and over. :)"
3,Good Sound Track,"I saw this movie and I must say I was alittle disappointed, I really did think the movie would have had more skating moves. I did like it, but I was expecting more action moves like in ""You got served"" the skating was ok which I attributed to the fact that it had more actor and not real skaters. The music was off the hook I would buy the sound track.Lea Hopkins"
5,Roll bounce,"Cool , really cool. I'm glad I own it, so I can watch it over & over & over & over again"
4,OL' SCHOOL,THIS MOVIE IS A VERY GOOD MOVIE. IT TAKES U BACK TO HOW FUN LIFE WAS WHEN U WERE A YOUNG TEEN. I LUV THE 70'S VIBE 2 IT. CLASSIC!
4,Sweetness!!!!,"I ordered this movie and it came within a few days, I've never had a problem out of Amazon. Anyway, I watched a ""bootleg"" copy. I enjoyed the movie so much that I purchased it. I am not here to tell you the entire plot of the movie but what I will say is that it was enjoyable from beginning to end. Bow Wow did a great acting job and for those of you who enjoy ""old School"" roller skating, you'll like this film. Thanks....and as always...YMMV. Neosoul06"
4,Reminded me of home,"I GREW UP IN CHICAGO AND REMEMBER GOING TO THE SKATING RINKS IN THE EARLY 70'S. I PERSONALLY THINK THIS MOVIE WAS ""CUTE."" THERE WASN'T ANY SHOOTING, STABBING OR CAR JACKING. THE ACTING WAS PRETTY GOOD CONSIDERING WHAT THE FILM WAS ABOUT. MY 9 YEAR OLD ASKED IF THAT'S HOW IT WAS IN THE 70'S AND I SAID YES. THIS MOVIE TOOK ME HOME AGAIN.........THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD HAVE MADE IT A LITTLE BIT BETTER.................TO SEE A WHITE CASTLE RESTAURANT."
4,The fun just keeps on rolling.,All I can say is that it's so nice when a movie actually makes you feel good. What is it about movies that they can make the past feel like a better time than the present? I'm an 80s child who wishes I could've had a bigger taste of the 70s. This movie helps me do that and I really liked the flavor.
3,Not by Robert Rainford!,"I was looking for a cookbook by Robert Rainford the chef and host of the show License to Grill. Typing in his name pulled up this book. Me, silly person, did not pay attention to the other name listed. I figured Christopher Schlesinger was a co-author. Duh! Anyway, if you're looking for a book by Robert Rainford this is not it. Boy was my husband disappointed!"
3,"Great read, but use common sense","This book is a great, entertaining read, and it gives a lot of good information regarding technique. However, I tend to use the recipes themselves as ""ideas"" rather than follow the recipes to the letter. Some of the ingredient quantites seem almost absurd. For example, a recipe for pepper-crusted steak with blue cheese butter calls for 1 cup (!) of cracked black pepper and and a half-cup of kosher salt for 4 steaks. Use a little common sense, adjust the recipes accordingly, and you'll get good results."
2,Rare because it sucks,I bought this when Amazon was selling 3 for $15..a pretty good deal. I should've known better since I've never seen this in the store. I have sensitive eyes and this stuff BURNS. It feels like I just put jalapenos in my eye. No matter how long I leave it in I still need to rinse it with another saline. Opti Replenish is much better.
3,Sam Johnson,"Ambient Flowers is a scholarly work, described as a reference DVD that is true, however I hoped for fewer decisions to make, to pop it in my DVD, start my treadmill and off I go. I would like to see this DVD made into a library of work, each DVD dedicated to 50 minutes, or so, for exercise buffs looking for simple and useful nature DVDs for stationary bikes, or treadmills."
2,Mini Dog Bone Cake Pan,"I like the pan however, it's size is very deceiving. Change your title to include (""MINI"" - DOG CAKE PAN) This pan was not what I expected and really put a dent in my plans for my doggie birthday party. I was embarrassed as I am known for outstanding doggie parties and this one was laughed upon. I eventually need to order another one but really don't think its worth 20.00 I should have received 2 for the price I paid."
3,"Very small pan, but shape is great","This is a nice pan, but I was surprised to see how small it actual was. It measures APROXIMATELY 9 1/4""x 6 1/2"" at it's widest and longest points and is great for individual doggy cakes, but it is small."
4,I See The Glory,"A nice little video which should be added to the Who lover's collection along with Kids, Maximum R&B, and Isle Of Wight. Some lip sync but still fun to watch."
4,Great companion piece!,"While not the definitive Who video, this makes an excellent addition to any Who film collection. Some of the clips here are available on other videos (e.g., THE KIDS ARE ALRIGHT), but many are only available here, including a wonderful promo film of ""Join Together"" and a live version of ""Magic Bus"" from 1973. Also, promo films of some of their early hits (e.g., ""Pictures of Lily"") that were edited for THE KIDS ARE ALRIGHT are presented here unedited.A very good video anthology of the best of one of rock's greatest bands. Grab it soon in case it goes out of print.(Collector's note: The laserdisc version of this has a filmed performance of ""Relay"" from the Russell Harty show in 1973 that is not on the VHS version.)"
3,"Great book- horrible spine, not re-readable.","I found this book very worthwhile. I originally bought it, and after browsing through the inside, I was about to immediately return it (found the art tiny and unappealing). I decided to read it anyway, and found that I enjoyed it alot. This book contains a bunch of B&W; vignettes and stories about the author and his girlfriends. He is painfully honest and the flow is awesome (think: Crumb, Clowes), but there is one problem. I only buy graphic novels so that i can re-read them forever. After first reading, the binding began to rip, and the first two pages fell out.Love the book, but if I can't re-read it (because spine falls apart), goodbye!"
3,average blowing session,"I just listened to this CD from my collection and wasn't impressed. Dorham's playing is OK but he's far from his best on this date. The main attraction was tenor saxophonist Rocky Boyd, who briefly replaced Hank Mobley in Miles Davis' quintet after this album, but listening to this makes me wonder what Miles saw in him that Mobley and others didn't have. Yes, his tone is hard and pungent like Trane's, but his ideas come out slowly and his improvised choruses never develop much in the way of interesting lines. The best part of the album is the piano playing of Walter Bishop (out of Bud Powell). But there are many, many better hard bop records from this era."
2,Stretches your socks out,"Bought this for hubby when he had major surgery, to help him get his socks on when I was not home to help him. It is soooo big around, to get your sock around it, would stretch your socks out. Hubby said ""heck no!"" Gave it to my father. Have no idea if he has used it or not."
1,This is not good,"I had a simular item to this one, I got while in hospital and it lasted about 3 years before plastic broke. I made a mistake I ordered 3 of the Maddack Deluxe flexible Sock and Stocking aid;white and the White material around one is raveling very bad. I have not opened one of the remaining 2. I had planed to use one for a gift, but this changed my mind. I do not recommend this item."
3,"it works, but stretches the socks. I prefer unger nabber","After back surgery I was not able to bend and had trouble with such basics as putting on my socks. I got this sock aid but only used it a few times. It works on very stretchy socks only, and stretches them even more.I found that a short UNGER The Nifty Nabber 18"" worked better by grabbing the top of the sock without having to put the whole thing into the sock."
2,sock aid,Perhaps the reason I didn't like this item is because I really don't need it yet.I tried it and discovered that it was much easier to put my socks on by hand.
1,Useless and frustrating,"This device will not make you happy if your need it to overcome a limitation. Frankly, to get the sock on with this thing, you need to be able to get the device onto your foot--if you can do this, you'd not need the device at all. The same limitations that keep you from putting on a sock will frustrate you with this device. You will break a sweat trying to get your toes in far enough as you wiggle your foot and the device. It is not the answer. In fact, it is the wrong item to buy for someone struggling to get dreessed. Then should you get your foot in it, you have to muscle it up your foot. The sock will not gently glide up onto your shoe. I would think this a great Aprils Fools Day toy at best, but at worst it is not something even worth trying."
2,Not as easy as it looks.,The Deluxe Sock Aid is not designed as easy as it looks. My mother found it to be cumbersome and ackward.
3,Needs Better Instructions,"Use is not entirely intuitive; and there are no real instructions on how to use it. It may work, but I have not yet tried it."
3,Nifty tool but...,"This a great tool. It makes putting on socks easy again. However, the fabric covering started tearing away from the frame after a few uses. I had to repair it and I don't know how long it will hold up."
4,Very helpful,I have ALS and putting on my socks became impossible until I got this. It took a little practice to figure out how to use it properly. It works very well. The only drawback is it is difficult for me to put the sock on initially.
2,Not for people with hand weakness or dexterity problems,"I purchased this product because I have ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease) and I have difficulty putting on socks among other things. I was hoping that it would help make it easier. Unfortunately, I can't even begin to load the sock onto the device so it's basically worthless to me. If you have any difficulty with your hands, this item is not for you. If hand strength isn't the issue, it will probably be a worthwhile purchase."
5,bought for mom,I bought this for my mom who has had a hip replacement. She has a hard time putting on socks. Since buying this she has no problems at all. Helps her retain some independence. Great product. User friendly.
5,Great product.,This sock aid is great for women. It doesn't stretch your socks out too far and is very easy to use. It might be a little difficult for a man with bigger feet because it squeezes together and is pretty narrow. I love it - well worth the price!Also speedy delivery!
5,It helps a lot!,"I have end stage arthritis in my right hip. I had my wife help me get socks on my right foot, otherwise it was a slow painful stretch for me to bend my leg and pull up on my toes to get the socks on. With this product, I slip the sock over the cloth part. I then let the sock aid almost lie on the floor and I slip my foot into it. I have to pull the sock over my heel and then I can pull the sock aid up my calf and lo and behold, the sock is on. I us a compression knee sleeve and I use the sock aid to get that on too."
3,It's just okay.,"Not bad for the price.Sometimes you need to put some baby powder on it to help slip on the socks a little quicker.If I had to purchase another sock aid I would go with the plastic with the handles on it.This one bends,the plastic will not !For a few more dollars ... go with the plastic one rather then this one."
2,Did not find this useful,"This device has a terry cloth covering which makes it nearly impossible to easily slip into the opening of socks. It is also shorter in length than other models, which means long socks simply cannot be pulled onto the leg at all. I found it very difficult to use, and not at all helpful."
4,A little flimsy but useful,Bought this for my mother-in-law who suffers from osteoporitic back pain. She has trouble bending. This helps her put on socks easily. I can't see this thing lasting long as it is basically cardboard wrapped in fabric.
5,works like a charm,"This is about the best Stocking Aid device out there in that it is simple to use,durable(they last for years,and relatively inexpensive. I bought this one for one of my patients but I use one myself as I had a total hip replacement several years ago. For individuals with reduced range of motion in their hip they can put a sock on quicker than someone with more dexterity. This is a Godsend."
5,I am a very satisfied repeat buyer :),"My father suffers from back pain and hip pain. I bought this item for him two years ago, not really knowing if it was liked or not... he's not a man of many words. Well, he just visited from FL and I could see he needed a replacement, as his was a well used and well worn favorite accessory. I just got another one for him, and he was thrilled. Told me that he uses it every day and makes sure it's always packed when travelling. By the looks of the first one, he was telling the truth. Works well, I am truly happy that my Dad found it to be so helpful. He does wear diabetic socks, (not sure if that would matter or not in it's usefulness)."
3,Bad stitching and thread.,This is an excellent product and works great. It has one fatal flaw you need to know about. The stitching will fail on you. Either the straps will tear off or the hem stitching holding the plastic inside of the cloth sleeve will tear out. The manufacturer needs to specify a stronger thread and/or more passes of the machine.As a consumer you can avoid this happening with a two prong approach. First get very stretchy socks or oversized socks. Pulling tight mostly cotton socks will guarantee failure. Also not a bad idea to buy two at once.Product says right on it that it cannot be returned for sanitary/health reasons.
4,Good product,"This product worked well except for nylon stockings, my mother recently had a knee replacement surgery and afterwards used this product everyday"
3,Stocking Aid,"It's a lot thinner than I expected. It works okay, but being so thin the back end gets pretty narrow to put your foot into it. The one the hospital gave me is a deluxe one I guess."
1,JUNK,I orderd and received on time but they where not made by Ableware as stated in ad. It was made by G4 medical. Very poorly made and on first use started to tear wear strap is attached to terry cloth and nylon sleeve
2,Did not last long:,"I found the concept good, but the quality of this item was very poor. The terry cloth cover quickly began to ravel and after 2 weeks the pull handles tore off."
1,Did not like it,"If you are using support hose, the product is not very friendly. It simply may be that this product was made for regular socks or stocking."
1,Greatly disappointed,"We were so disappointed and sent it back. Impossible to use on support hose. I guess some people can use it for putting on their sox, but it was of absolutely no help to us. It is especially difficult if you have arthritis."
4,Sock Aid purchase from Amazon really helps,"I purchased the Sock Aid because my left hip joint is so badly damaged that I can hardly bend over to put a sock on my foot (or tie my shoes, for that matter). The Sock Aid allows me to comfortably put the sock on the affected foot with ease. I will be using the Sock Aid for some time to come as I recover from hip replacement surgery . I highly recommend the product for those who find putting on socks a difficult task ... and the price is right."
4,great aid,This is great for someone recovering from surgery - either hip or knee. You need this for a few months to be able to get your own socks on.
3,So so...,"I actually like this product and have purchased several, but the flexible plastic inner piece has a tendancy to crack and loose its shape. I'm looking for something better. Longer lasting."
4,"Works well, with some misgivings","I've used this after two knee surgeries that were 6 weeks apart (can't bend my knee enough to put on socks the ""regular"" way yet). For regular socks, it works like a charm. I had less luck with very long or support hose (as someone else here said, with strong compression socks, it squeezes the opening so much you can't fit your foot in). My other reservation is that the terrycloth that covers the aid unravels after a not-so-long period. Mine is coming apart about 3 months after purchase (I use it everyday, once a day). On the other hand, this thing is under 10 bucks, so ordering a replacement wasn't too painful. A good value overall, as long as you know what to expect."
5,Wonderful Sock Aid,"I must tell this is my second Sock helper aid. I had knee replacement could not of live without this product. The 1st one I still use up at lake but I needed to replace it with a new one, old one looks petty used and I do not have to carry one to the lake anymore works great, Easy no bending to put socks on easy to use slip sock on aid then slip foot in pull on then shoes."
3,Sock Aid Does the Job,"Although not rocket science, sometimes a simple device can make life much more accommodating to elders. This is such a device. When the legs and back no longer flex as they did in younger days this aid is a boon to assist one putting on a sock or stocking. Most days I don't need it, but on that occasional stiff day it is invaluable. Works well, too soon to tell how well it will hold up to continued use."
5,Sock and Stocking Aid,Wonderful product especially for Seniors. I have two of these low tech life savers. It works fine and is very inexpensive. Prevents back and knee injury secondary to attempts at putting on socks.
4,does a good job,"This is the second one I have purchased in the past year. It does exactly what it claims, and has been a great help for me."
1,Save your money. Useless!!!!!!,"Unless your foot and leg are equal to or less than the diameter of the compession stocking (which would defeat the purpose of compression stockings and provide no compression) do not purchase this item. The stocking is stronger than the stocking aid and shrinks the opening to the smallest diameter of the stocking opening, making it impossible to slip your foot into the opening, let alone insert your lower leg. If you can insert your foot, pulling the stocking aid results in the removal of the aid without pulling up the stocking. Exhausting work and not returnable. The label says: Due to health and sanitary issues, this item may not be returned, exchanged. What a racket!"
2,Does not work for us.,I bought this item for my husband. He has a difficult time putting on his socks. It did NOT work for him. Perhaps it may for someone else. Gave it to Goodwill.
4,good purchase,"since my husband had his back surgery he could not put on his socks at all, with this he can do it by himself. He loves it."
5,My review,"I did not think this would work, but it was great. The socks slip on and I was able to put my socks on by myself. Great."
2,Follow up on a tough product,"This product looked like a good solution to my problems: compression stockings, degenerative bone disease, making it difficult to get the stockings on. Couldn't get it to work -- set aside. Recently had an opportunity to have it checked by a wound care nurse. She was able to get it to work on her (small narrow feet). We couldn't get it to work on my size 9W feet. So, in the trash it goes."
1,Do you really have the time to waste.....?,"With all the wonderful music out there do you need this nonsense...? life is to short to hear all the good stuff.this is just noise.no not ambience ...noise, just turn on your tv set and find an empty channel.now sit back and listen to the white noise.If you want to pay for that then by all means buy this disc.Move on."
5,forbidden twin,"Twins but unknown to each other. Mom raised the American twin, dad raised the English twin. Mom and step-dad dies, so the American twin visits the land of her birth.Meets the British twin's ""fiance"". Sparks fly but ""surrender is forbidden"". There is a touch and go surgical procedure but in the end all is well and the right brother ends up with the right sister (x2) :)!"
3,Just fair,I had high hopes for this book but was disappointed in its scope and choice of artwork. I would not really recommend it. If you live near a library maybe you should see if they can get it for you and then you decide for yourself before you lay down the bucks.
5,Ethics for the New Millennium,"To all of youI used to see things on one or two dimensional prespectives. After reading the book, I've gained more vision on the purpose of our life.It is a good book, and the next thing I realize that I don't get dissapointed on things that easy.If you wanna live your life happily, just read the book!"
4,An uplifting book on ethics and values,"The Dalai Lama is an inspiration for westerners in search of meaning in their lives and a spiritual path. He discusses the issues with compassion and insight. For those wishing spiritual guidance and a practical means of attaining higher spirituality, I emphatically recommend all the books by the ""realized"" spiritual master Sri Chinmoy!"
5,Dalai Lama on Ethics,".The Dalai Lama has become the voice of sanity in this generation. His advice is sensible, thought-provoking, comforting, non-eceumenical, and challenging.Yes, read this book!Kim BurdickStanton, DE"
4,A Message of Hope,"Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, is certainly not a literary artist, but he is a brilliant struggler for Peace. ""Ethics for the New Millennium"" is one of his many ""outcries"" for an ethical system which demands a re-evaluation of our society, a setting of new higher goals in which interdependency of everyone's action will lead to a better world. The task ahead requires discipline, development of spiritual values (love, compassion, generosity, tolerance), and a firm belief in the natural-born goodness of human beings. It is a message not only to be read but upon which action is demanded, a message much needed in our society and not to be considered utopian. May the reader enjoy it and share with the writer his hopes for an ethical improvement worldwide."
2,Not very accessible,"Although the concepts were well described and extremely well argued, I feel the discussion was not direct enough to reach the intended audience. Although I gained some insight in a number of areas, I didn't find the agruments compelling enough to reach someone who isn't already familiar with the ethics. As a book which is supposedly aimed towards people who aren't already familiar with applying some of the concepts in their life, I found the treatise too difficult to follow. There were not enough practical suggestions, implementations or meditation suggestions to help someone really find what to do.As a philosophical treatise explaining the logic of ethical and compassionate behavior, I found it was too drawn out and read like intellectual acrobatics. I am an admirer of HHDL, and I have read some of his other books, but found this one did not really hit the mark."
2,I prefer the Dalai Lama in person.,"I have always followed the Dalai Lama - movies, tapes, live appearances etc. I have always enjoyed his teachings, so I thought I'd try a book. However, I found this book to be too intellectual. I felt it was work to read it. I prefer the Dalai Lama in person.At the same time I ordered a book on amazon called ""Working On Yourself Doesn't Work"" by Ariel & Shya Kane. It was fun and easy to read. I highly recommend it!"
2,I know people aren't going to like my review,"I read half the book and kept falling asleep as I was reading. The book struck me as naive, tending toward Pollyanna. Excuse me, all you admirers of this book, but this is honestly how I felt about it. I find life to be so much more complex than his thesis seems to propose - not that there isn't some truth to what he says. I like what Alfred North Whitehead said, ""Morality.... is what the majority then and there happen to like and immorality is what they dislike"". The Dalai Lama seems to say it is absolute, but I see it as relative."
2,Zen and the Art of Intellectualization,"This book was a major disappointment and source of frustration.Perhaps in the East people are capable of ""...think,think,think[ing]..."" their way to compassion and harmony.In the West we need something more experiential and practical to bridge the split in body-mind that lies at the heart of our individual and collective psychopathology. There is nothing in this book that hasn't been available to us for many years through western spiritual tradition and it fails for the same reason those traditions do.The heart of compassion is not a philosophical concept,it is a felt experience.It can only become a way of being in beings who have achieved a degree of balance and integration in body/mind/spirit. Books that are much more valuable on the path to wholeness..."
5,Good Book,"We face many decisions in this century that others in past centuries have never had to face. This book and Donald V. Paone's ""To Be or Not to Be: Reflections on Modern Bioethical Choices"" help to give us a handle on many of these issues. If you liked this book, definitely get Paone's book too."
3,Enlightening For Sure,"Gotta love the Dalai Lama - he has much to speak of and tell the world. We should all listen to his perspective on ethics. We all need ethics in our lives. The Dalai Lama is very wise and peaceful - a wonderful role model. This book is an enlightening read; it is informative and causes one to think about his words and ponder their own lives and actions. I read this book for my college Ethics course. It was a great book that took us throughout the course material throughout the quarter. Interesting concepts arise, and no doubt you will be thinking hard after reading this book. Not a bad thing at all! We need more Ethics in this world we are living in."
4,school,a book written by the Dalai Lama himself? how could you go wrong. the book was enlightening. I needed this for a class that i was enrolled in at a community college. glad i read it.order shipped fine. condition was also as i expected.
5,best of the best,"Most of the books by the Dalai Lama are taped talks. This is a rare book he actually sat down to write. If the criteria is positive change, this is the best book for the greatest audience, ever."
4,A novel to help you through life,"While the Dalai Lama does not discuss anything I have not heard before, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The writings reinforced what I have learned over the past 44 years. I would recommend this book to anyone."
1,This book is not very helpful,"I threw this book away in annoyance after reading it. The reading level of this book is at the 4th grade level. The point shouldn't be to talk down to the reader. In addition, the wedding vows that the author and his significant other recited were really cloying: ""I want to play in your sandbox"". This book doesn't reflect very well on the field of psychology."
2,a chore to read,"this is the first book i've felt compelled to review and, obviously, it's not because i loved it. i read ""the perfect elizabeth"" and thought it was only slightly entertaining. after reading the reviews for ""the essential charlotte"", i decided to give libby schmais another chance. i really wish i hadn't. the story was soooo boring and redundant, the characters were underdeveloped. i can't let myself leave a book unfinished so i practically forced myself to read it, which wasted a painful three days of my summer (the point is, if it weren't so bland, i could have finished it in a few hours). if you're going to buy this book, don't expect entertainment or originality. if you want any stimulation, you're better off staring at the pretty cover for a few hours."
4,good little story but not the plot I thought it was intended,"I picked this book up because I liked the author's previous book, THE PERFECT ELIZABETH. Well, this read is good but not as developed as the first and the story is more intense.Charlotte's mother, Corinne, dies and in the will, Charlotte is to live with her biological father, William, for a year in her mother's apartment. Charlotte and William had never met before this so it is a bit of a challenge at first. Charlotte dips into acting and the basis of the story revolves around the acting class and her flirt with another actor in the class, Irish Colin.I thought there was more focus on this fling rather than the premise of Charlotte and her father getting to know each other. While it did reveal their new relationship, it didn't develop it as much as I think it should have.Overall an ok read but not what I thought it would be."
5,WOULD YOU BELIEVE......A GREAT SET?????,"Don Adams starred as Maxwell Smart for 5 years on television and this set is highly recommended for fans of the show. Each year is highlighted by hours of extras including interviews and bloopers and priceless clips of Don Adams and his many television appearences. A perfect gift for someone who likes slapstick humor. Get this set and go back to a time of shoe phones, secret agent dogs, zany evil spies of Kaos and much more."
5,Great series-great price $86.99 (get it?),I loved this series growing up and finaly got the DVD's. I remember laughing so much at this show and now I can watch them any time I want to.Did anyone else catch the price? Was this a little injoke?
5,"Great Series, Great Deal","I hadn't seen any of these episodes in years, and now to have every episode made at my finger tips is fantastic. The set is packaged very nicely. Excellent deal!"
4,Get Smart TV series,My husband and I have only seen the first two episode but its funny and a little cheese. However I think it makes a great gift for those that are fans of the series and one that want to be.
5,J Vanz,"When I was a kid Get Smart reruns were on at least 10 times a day. Being a big fan of Mel Brook's movies, this show soon became my favorite. Then, it disappeared from free TV. And, the building I lived in wasn't wired for cable. Plus, when I got cable the shows were edited. I couldn't even find it on VHS. I also had some bad bootleg experiences. So now, finally, they put it on DVD at a reasonable price. You get all 5 seasons, every episode uncut, tons of extras and history. Plus, it comes in cool packaging. Now, as big Get Smart fan, I no longer have to depend on any TV station to watch it. I OWN IT!"
1,Great Show--Awful Packaging,"The Get Smart series is as I remembered it as a kid, a winner, and if the series (25 DVD's) had been better packaged the price I paid would have been a steal! But 9 DVDs were badly scratched on receipt and 5 were completlely unplayable. The set was shipped in an excessively large outer carton and being unprotected was banged around during transit. Also, the set's packaging is loaded with visual kitsch but does little to protect the DVDs from damage (most of the discs actually rub against each other). So I wouldn't recommend this set unless there is another more thoughtfully packaged alternative available."
5,Got Smart,Loved the show. I would have liked to hear more about what the chief did after the show went off the air. I thought it was very well done and very funny.
1,No Subtitle nor closed caption for this TV series!,"I was deeply surprised and disappointed that there was no closed caption and even, no subtitle since I am hearing impaired. ""Get Smart"" TV series was one of my favorite TV series of all time. I had a difficult time to listen what they said on television series. I need subtitle or closed caption in order to understand clearly. How could the market ignore our concern? Obviously, they are still discriminating against hearing impaired and semi-illerate people who need to read and listen English in order to improve their educational standard as well as assimiate into Ameican culture. Shame on you for your bigotry and prejudice treatments to our hearing impaired society as the second class citizens!"
1,Digitally Restored? NO WAY. 100% Black and White!!,I was so happy to receive the complete colection and as I started watching the episodes from disc one on....I noticed that the shows were entirely in black and white and the characters all had a funny grid pattern running across their image. I scanned all the disc (thinking maybe just the earlier versions were b/w...to find that the entire selection was in b/w..and not restored at all. BUNK gift and BUMMED customer!
1,Love the series...Hate the careless packaging!,"Don't get me wrong...I love Get Smart! The series is a prime example of what television should still be! But what is happening to quality control!! I paid $109.00 for this package on Amazon. It arrived sealed..Brand new! But fifteen of the discs were scratched and fingerprinted! Ten of those looked like they were played with by infants! Please, if you are a DVD collector and this is happening to you...complain! These things are outrageously priced and should be perfect. I blame the manufacturers. They are probably packed by people making minimum wage who don't care. I am at the point where I am afraid to buy DVDS! Every package I buy has at least one or two bad discs. Take a look at yours. If any are scratched or marked...Let people know!"
5,"I couldnt wait""""","I bought my set when it came out from time life and paid the full price for it.Im an avid fan and would have paid even more if needed.Whoever buys this at 139.00 is getting a great deal as long as it contains everything the time life set had.A very funny classic comedy just as funny today as it was in the sixties.Go for it"""""""
5,Get Smart,"This is without a doubt the best sit-com ever made. I have been watching re-runs of Get Smart on TV since they aired the original when I was the tender age of four years old. It never becomes stale despite that fact that technology, politics and culture have moved on over the last forty-five years. I wonder if it ever will become stale or whether one can honestly say that we have the first classic TV show that generations will enjoy just as they do the classical composers.No better product has ever come out of US television. Simply a masterpiece of comedy."
5,Still Funny...,"Very funny stuff. I watched the original series on TV. This is still EXTREMELY funny stuff.Interesting stuff I noticed (comparing to TV today): they light a lot of cigarettes, but very rarely actually smoke them."
5,Get Smart and Buy This Series,"Any time I need to get cheered up and have a good laugh I stick in one of these DVD's of Get Smart. The clever writing, the irony, the gadgets, the timing and wit of Don Adams, Ed Platt, Barbara Feldon, Hymie the Robot. What a great show - probably the last great spy show we'll ever see on TV."
2,Sloppy presentation detracts from classical comedy,"The six short subjects on this double dvd set represent, I am led to believe, the total short subject output of the great W.C. Fields. I did not expect a crystal clear video image, as these items are about 70 yrs old, although overall the quality is not that bad. Similarly, the audio track, while a bit ""crackly"" at times, was quite acceptable. What did make me threaten the life span of the TV, player and disc however, was the lack of sinc between the video and audio tracks. It is rather off putting to find a second or so difference between what you see ""being said"", and what you actually hear. You feel you are watching a poorly dubbed foreign film. The comedy is still very appealing, but this attention to fine detail on the part of the makers of the set leaves a bad taste in my mouth."
1,Waste of money,This DVD is terrible. The soundtrack is off by about two seconds. It's like watching a dubbed movie. The voices are heard after the actors speak...very annoying.The VHS versions I've seen in the past are much better in sound and picture quality...beware of DVDs below $10.00!
1,MACADY - keep away,I havent seen this DVD but the reviews above dont surprise me in the least. I have bought another Macady DVD (Laurel & Hardy double feature) which was awful - soundtrack out of sync & poor picture quality - my advice is regardless of the film & its star(s) - if its released by Macady - then stay well away and save your money
1,A General Rule of Thumb,"Hmmmm....If it's from Madacy, you will be MAD when you SEE what you paid for.Before transferring a movie to video, these people would put a pristine print through a blender just to make sure their standards don't deviate.Madacy=GarbageThis is one of those DVD's that doesn't deserve one star but it's as low as I could go."
3,LOW PRICE MAKES IT ALRIGHT,"Yeah the quality of the 4th and 5th features is terrible, but the rest of the shorts are passable, and the whole thing goes for less than ten dollars. I did not feel ripped off... but will buy the criterion version when it becomes available. As for the films themselves, vintage WC."
5,Jeff Bradshaw -Bone Deep,"I love this CD. It is so smooth, upbeat and relaxing. I have told all of my friends about this cd. This is definitely one of my favorites and recommend it to anyone. You do not have to be a jazz fanatic to enjoy this."
5,Good to the BONE!!!,"WOW!!!! Off the chain, off the hook and everything in between. The cuts on this are so good and the best part is each one is so varied. I am loving it. He plays the trumbone in such a unique way. Such and enjoyable experience. This cd gives you such a warm feeling. It's deliciously thumping!!! A must have for the jazzy. Enjoy."
5,Bone Deep soothes your Soul!,"From the moment that I heard my first preview of the single ""Slide"" I knew that I was in love with the music of Jeff Bradshaw! What I didn't know was that his entire album would offer a variety of soulful struts from ""Make it Funky"", to the smooth, soothing sound of Jeff and Jill on ""Slide"". This album is great for the Smooth Jazz lover too. Two songs stand out for me and will soon be two of the top Smooth Jazz cuts on the radio - ""Smooth Soul"" and (one of my favorites) ""On My Way""! Floetry does a great job with ""Beautiful Day""; Carol Riddick is fantastic in ""Can you Come Over""! Curl up with the one you love on this one, if you can.Get Bone Deep - you will truly love it."
1,ouch!,"This book hurt. I usually can tolerate some silliness in pulp horror, but this book was awful. Moore makes Bentley Little look like James Joyce. A series of drawn out fight scenes makes up the plot. The main character took so many beatings and stayed alive that I thought we were heading towards an Unbreakable finale where he ends up being a superhero. Oh, and they also hit the lottery. This is not early Stephen King, this is more like early Don King.Skip this one."
2,Just plain bad...,"I give Mr. Moore one star for creating something from nothing (I'm working on my first horror novel, so I know how hard it is) and another star for convincing Leisure Books to publish this bad idea of a horror novel...Where to begin? The 17 year old hero gets his ass kicked so many times in the course of three days that he should have been dead before the halfway point. And then he wins the lottery and that's never mentioned again - why? And those aliens/monsters that Mr. Moore seemed to have created from a bad Lovecraft story - the descriptions were horrible and I could never picture any of them. And where exactly did they come from? And why were they after the Western Key? And why did Chris's mom have the key in the first place? Nothing was explained. The entire book was a series of fist fights/brawls. That's all it was. Bad, just plain bad. Sorry."
1,Train Wreck,I love horror. I love everything about it. But what I don't love is a protagonist who spends the entire book getting his butt kicked in the most graphic and amazing way and is still able to take on the bad guys in the end. It was endless and rambling and never tied into the intro in anyway. I am all for suspending reality for a good read but this was a a train wreck. I continued reading in the hopes that it would redeem itself somewhere. I was terribly wrong.
3,Missing feather,"I really liked the hat, but it did not come with the feathers pictured. I will probably add some craft feathers before Halloween to complete my McGonagall ensemble."
3,"Great idea, beautiful illustrations, but...","I found the idea behind this book, and the way in which it was presented, to be wonderful. The illustrations are lively and filled with a sort of movement that is accompanied by language which really gives the reader a sense of the ""soul"" (if one can say that) of each of these amazing kids. I have to say, however, that when I began to read of the first child's condemnation to ""the big box"", I caught my breath and grabbed my chest and thought, ""I can't give this to a child; it would scare them too much."" The way in which the sentence is presented leads one to believe that there really is a big box and kids really do get locked away for being themselves. Young children who are just beginning to come into a sense of themselves don't understand the figurative as well as adults do. I agree with the reader who suggested that this book be recommended for adults and not children."
2,Not for 4 year olds,"The message meant more to me than to my young children. They didnt understand why the children were being locked in a box. They think playing in cardboard boxes is fun, not a punishment for exercising too much freedom. I could see using the book as a basis for discussion, but I think it may just scare children that they too could be locked up by their parents."
4,Great Discussion book,I read this book aloud to my fifth graders. We discussed the book and the metaphorical implications. What does it mean to lose freedoms? Why are rules made? How does a child obtain more freedom? Do parents have rules that society sets? An excellent book if discussed WITH the children. It helps them understand society and how some of us are ready for some freedoms and some aren't.
1,not appropriate for kids,"I am a teacher, when I read the review about this book, I thought I would love it as I love Toni Morrison. I found this book to be too scary for children. It talks about children who were put in a box because they couldn't handle their freedom. I don't like the moral behind it either. The picture are lovely though!"
1,Roman emperors--not a good book==too academic,This particular book is for research not for general reading...Was very dissappointed in book. Good for a study but not fun reading.
4,Essential if you love blues guitar!!,"This CD showcases the best of Jimmie Vaughn's talent and beautiful tone. I was never a big fan of the Fabulous Thunderbirds but Vaughn's solo work is excellent. Clean, clear concise and from the heart blues."
3,Go Ape or go Giant!!!,"Ok, here it is. I am a huge fan of Abbott and Costello movies. Africa Screams is a decent one and has many funny moments but its not their best. Jack and The Beanstalk is ok but thats about it. You won't go wrong watching these movies though. So, on this DVD double feature i went Ape and Not Giant if you get my drift. Ape for Africa Screams and throw out the magic beans for Jack and the Beanstalk. 3 stars is all i could give!"
5,It was really...good!,"Just before christmas of 2005, my husband started talking about Abbot and Costello movies. One movie he mentioned in paticular was ""Jack and The Beanstalk"". So I decided to search for the DVD on Amazon. I was so amazed to see how many Abbot and Costello movies and I thought of how my husband would like the selections because he's a movie buff...I am not. So I read the reviews and they made me somewhat nervous because they were VERY mixed. But one thing I found in commom is that those who reviewed said is that the movie transfer was poor.Well, I watched the movie and I thought ir was GREAT! I hesitated when my husband asked me because I REALLY didn't want to watch some old boring film. It didn't take me long to laugh. Even our children enjoyed it. I said I would buy him more titles soon.Don't worry about the film quality in the beginning because once you start watching, you'll laugh at the silliness of it all then it won't bother you."
1,Avoid ANYTHING from MADACY in Canada,I was FORCED to give at least 1 star. I would have given a 0 or asked for one back...I have three different versions of Africa Screams and this is by far the worst transfer I've ever seen. Goodtimes Home Video has Africa Screams on DVD (6.99 @ Wal-Mart) and looks as good as anything Universal has ever put out for A&C.Sound and video on these DVD's are worse than the VCD I picked up on EBay for 5 bucks.This is the third DVD I have from MADACY and they are ALL very poor quality. The video tapes would look much better. This is a waste of money at any price. Others companies (Goodtimes Home Video and Platinum) have the same movies. I suggest those.
4,Abbot and Costello - Reallyu Had A Thing Going!,"Abbot and Costello were a comedy team for a long times until the fought more then they acted. As a result of the on-screen chemistry - many memorable moments in film history were created. (Who could forget Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein? A classic.)This very cheep DVD features two of their funniest films and great for kids too. Africa Screams and Jack And The Beanstalk. Africa Screams is hysterical. It puts all the stereotypical impressions of the African Culture and mixes them with Abbot and Costello. What could be funnier?Jack And The Beanstalk was cleverly written and involves music, magic harps and a lot of character performances all mixed in with the humor that is only Costello's brand. He plays Jack and boy do you realize what a mess the fantasy world would be in if he was actually there!The quality of the transfer is not the best I have seen, but the movies speak for themselves. And, it's a great price!"
2,The Roan Group version....A Mixed Bag,"Both ""Africa Screams"" & ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" have been around for years. The two films were once available in Super 8 & 16mm dupes of varying quality. The Roan Group DVD is simply a copy of the Image Ent Laser Disc from the 1990's. Screams suffers the most as the first 30 minutes is very soft, and has a greenish tint to it. The remaining 50 minutes is great though. Beanstalk is BEAUTIFUL and has all original Warner Brothers opening and closing credits. Be mindful that it is the original release version running 78 minutes, not the 81 minute pre-view version. All in all a good buy, just don't expect the best quality."
1,unwatchable. total ripoff.,"if i could give this 0 stars, nothing could get this to play. the audio stunk. the video stunk even more. not worth any price. if anyone knows a way to get a version of this that is watchable, feel free to point it out in your review."
5,Sosa sounds younger than ever before,There's not a lot to say. For me this album belongs to the three best she ever did. Especially I like on this one that she recorded just songs written by the great Charly Garcia. She's chosen a very modern and contemporary sound which may be not this familiar to many Sosa fans. I think this album can especially recommended to young people as well as it features fantastic songs with beautiful lyrics and of course the voice of Argentina Mercedes Sosa.
5,excellent must buy!!!,"I absolutely like Craig David's song ""7 days"". The Full crew Radio Mix is cool and so is the Radio Edit version I hear it 7 days a week...if your craig david fan you would like this as one of your collections."
4,Unforgettable 7 Days,"This song has what not many song don't, a blend of acoustic guitar and crisp digital beats. It makes this single a stand out from the rest. It's about his reoccurring meeting with a woman he is curious of. It is one of those songs you will never forget."
5,Magnificent Movie Memories,"This compilation of songs performed by Anna Karina, the iconic New Wave muse, is a treasure chest filled with stirring movie remembrances. It contains such gems as ""Angela's Song"", the ditty with music by Michel Legrand and lyrics by Jean Luc Godard (Karina's ex-husband) from ""A Woman is a Woman"", I Never Told You That I Would Always Love You"" from Godard's masterpiece ""Pierrot le Fou"", and Gainsbourg's ""La Noyee"" from ""Vivre Ensemble"" (a 70's flick directed by Karina herself).One is transported back to the glorious days of 60s French cinema and is entranced by the mesmerizing vocals of the sultry actress, who has reinvented herself as a contemporary pop singer. Add ""Chansons de films"" to your collection of soundtracks!"
3,Size Surprise,"Great product. Works as it said, and haven't had any trouble in setting it up and using it. Formatting it was simple. the 2GB of webspace is limited in what you can do with it. And the unit itself is larger than I had expected when reading about it. Overall, worth thje low cost for an externaj hard drive with it's storage capacity."
1,"carefull, this thing is FRAGILE","it was a dark night, with a man burning the midnight tungsten and tapping on his keyboard. reaching up to plug in this drive, a bump was heard as the hard drive knocked into the laptop stand.to make a long story short...night gets darker as man realizes that the tapping noise, and red light in the back of the drive indicates the death of 150 gigabytes.if you buy this drive, cover it in bubble wrap."
1,Gave me an allergic reaction and burned my face.,"I would seriously caution anyone before using this on their face. The ingredients are listed as ""all natural"", but are still very irritating to some kinds of skins. You should research sandalwood, juniper berries, etc because its just not worth it. I put it on and received incredibly painful exfoliation to the degree that I've never had before.Please trust me, and avoid. If you're determined to get it, try out a small sample first- a drop on your hand or something - to make sure you're not allergic."
3,get one with the ornments!,"I'm a collector of differently-illustrated editions of this famous Christmas poem, so I didn't really have to have the cardboard ornaments which come with a new copy of this book. But if you intend for this to be the only copy you'll share with your children, be sure to buy a copy that comes with all the ornaments; they slip into little ""envelopes"" on each page, and their absence is pretty glaring and sad if, as I did, you buy a copy minus the additions. In my opinion, the book has not the best illustrations, even for ""cartoonish"" style, but they ARE colorful."
4,"Excellent story, but translation had no energy","If you are seeking solely to read for pleasure, this is not the translation you want. Lattimore is brutally literal, sacrificing smooth, flowing syntax for an attempt to duplicate every word of Greek in English. Certainly, if you are interested in the problems of Greek translation, this is an advantage, and you do probably acquire a more thorough understanding of Homeric society and culture with this method, but I still prefer the only other translator I have read, Samuel Butler, who, despite his dubious 1900-era language, does manage to infuse some vitality into the text. You will have to entertain yourself when reading Lattimore. Regardless, the Iliad is a great story and has a very moving final chapter. I would like to see it on the silver screen someday."
5,outstanding,"Lattimore's translation of this work by Homer is a page-turner, nearly three thousand years after it was written. The Trojan war is described as both a hell on earth and as essential in the eyes of gods and men. I have never been gladder I took the time to read a book than I was when I finished this one; I was left gasping at how good it was. There isn't absolutely anything I can say about this that hasn't been said thousands of times better than I can say it, but even knowing this I must encourage anyone who hasn't exposed themselves to this book to read it and in doing so, join the group of people who have looked as deeply into the past as possible and found something there worth fighting to be remembered."
1,Small Font Size,"I am not giving Homer a single star. His work is one of the greatest pieces of literature in history. However, be very cautious of this edition. The font size is very small and makes for difficult reading. I would strongly urge you to choose another edition with larger font size."
5,"This translation has a noble, stately rythm.","This translation attempts to replicate the rhythms of the original Greek. The hexameter verse of this translation has a stately, noble rhythm that the other blank verse translations can't replicate. The other translations seem flat, like regular prose compared to Lattimore's translation. To really appreciate it, sound it out in your mind as you read. The Companion to the Iliad by Malcolm Willcock is based on this translation and really enhanced my appreciation and understanding of the epic. I plan to get Lattimore's translation of the Odyssey next."
2,Awkward translation,"The major problem I have with this translation is the awkwardness of its language. There are long, unwieldy sentences with twisted syntax. Sometimes, the translation is obscure. For example: ""...and the will of Zeus was accomplished/since that time when first there stood in divison of conflict..."" Not every line is as bad as that, however. There are some passages that read fairly smoothly, and the last two lines of the fourth book stand out. The translation as a whole, however, mutilates the English language. There are better options if you would like to read the Iliad."
3,Certainly a Worthy Study,"I have respect for Homer's ""Iliad."" To be sure there are powerful images, dramatic confrontations, beautiful passages, and deep psychological insights. But in all honesty, I feel Homer lacks the genious of Aeschylus or Sophocles. Do not get me wrong. ""The Iliad"" IS an important and worthy study. I just can't say it matches Sophocles' Trilogy or Aeschylus' Trilogy."
3,THE Review,"In almost all of his books Roald Dahl deals quite harshly with, and ridicules the authoritarians in society. He believed that ""beastly people must be punished"" (Pendergast). But it was only when his book Boy was published that the truth behind his reasoning was revealed. For throughout Boy he shares the true tales of his child hood, which seemed to mostly revolve around ""beastly"" people. He portrays authoritarian figures with evil intentions; as depicted in his other books, such as Matilda. In Boy there are many of these figures, such as the headmasters at his schools, who enjoyed brutally caning their students, and the old lady in the candy shop, who holds some sort of a vindictive grudge against children who enter her store, especially boys. As a result of this, Dahl creates an overwhelmingly negative portrayal of adults, which thus leads to a great appeal to most youngsters."
5,"Fun, easy read...",My 15 year old brother-in-law enjoyed reading this book with me. I enjoyed it myself!!
3,Okay stories,Good book about growing up and some of the great stories you're expect from your grandfather. Could have used less information on the beatings headmasters used to give students.
2,Horrible!,"I thought this Biography very interesting but I have to say I will NEVER read it again, The horrible beatings he had to endure as a nine year old boy left me sickened and depressed,I made myself finish it, so I could write this review. The cruelty displayed by the Matron and Headmaster was terrible, especially since these boys were away from home with no one to talk to.If you enjoy reading about such things than this is the book for you.What is truly amazing is Dahl's humor in writing these memories, I guess he had to go through this so he could write his books,,,,,sad"
2,Boy,"We didn't like the book very much. Because: It was not so intersting to here about Roald Dahls lifestory. We guess that he had a exciting life, but as you know it's more fun to experience the episode by yourself, than to read about Roalds stories. Some of the episodes was fun, like when a drunken doctor amputeded his fathers arm. And the carcras was also fun. But sometimes the book became ""to funny"", and you most of all wanted to cry..... That's the reason that we only give the book to stars."
4,captivating,"Boy by Roald Dahl is a captivating novel about a young boy's childhood. The novel catches the reader's attention by the crazy antics that go on. It is very humorous, and interesting, with details that will stick in one's head. This is a short, snappy novel, written in the first person, that is truly a delightful read.The main character is a young boy who shares stories about his wild boarding school life, and intermittent scary medical adventures. Boy is a distilled autobiography of Roald Dahl as teenager. The author brings a true comedic perspective to his not so funny world. He describes his skewered environment at the same time that he conveys a sense that everything will be all right."
4,A great choice for an autobiography report!,"Boy is an autobiography of Roald Dahl. It tells all about Roald's childhood and early manhood, including all the pain and gore he went through as a child. The four main characters are Boy, or how Roald refered to himself throughout the book, Roald's two parents, and the cruel Matron that was at Roald's first boarding school. But anyway, Boy had quite the gruesome life. His nose was almost cut off, he had his adenoids cut out among many other accidents and adventures. I didn't like this book that much because of all the gore, and also because of it's lack of detail. However, I think that grades 5 and up should read it, it's very informative."
4,Book Review For Boy By Roald Dahl,This is a autobiography From when he was young all the way up to the end of secondary school.These were he's collection of his notes.There are some sad parts and some funny parts espaically when they put a dead rat in the gobstopper jar.Mrs pratchett finds it and shuts the shop And they think shes died from the shock.This story has lots of emotions I recommend this story for it is very funny.Also it has pictures of him for example When they had a school photo. Also Roald dahl Pretended that he was ill to go home Because he did not like the matron.I recommened it because it has mixed emotions.
1,A book for people who read everthing Mr.Dahl writes,This book made me want to forget all about Roald Dahl.Mr. Dahl usally always has tales of awesome sitions and invetions.This was tales of chilhood i would like to say that this book is recommended for people you like to follow there favorite author no matter what he writes.
2,Boy....By Roald Dahl,Book cover was very grimy. I was not pleased when I touched it and it had to be cleaned up before I would put it on my classroom shelf.
1,The Boy,"The Boy by Roald Dahl, This book is about Roald Dahl its all about his life and all his Wonderful times he had like going to norway for vacation and all the crazy things he did when he was little one of the things he did pull a trick on this candy shop lady but im not in liberty to tell you will just have to read the book to find out more. Personly i didnt like the book because there was hardly and action or real exciting parts. So I didnt like it because i like alot of action. I think this is he worst book he has writen so far. Just because its only about his childhood and growing up going to school witch doesnt intrest me much some parts like were he Savtadged his sisters boyfriends pipe. His whole family thought it was funny exept his sister and her boyfriend. So all in all i gave the book 1 star because there was no action."
4,Funny and Scary,"I read this book as a child and remember it as one of the funniest books I read. I am now 21 and I still found it very cute and funny. I love Roald Dahl's books. I think they are all wonderful books for both children and adults. This book takes the reader through some well chosen stories of Dahl's childhood. From rats in jars to boarding school life, Dahl shows us his colorful childhood and all the funny, inventive, and scary things it included."
4,In focus,"Ronald Dahl's ""Boy"" is an exciting book and is easy to read until the very end. From Dahl's days in early schooling to his late teen years he finds himself, causing mischief, going on long adventures, and meeting new people. This book starts out quikly and finishes the same way, but lets you go at the end to wonder what happens in the rest of his life. My favorite parts of the book were, his days on the islands in Norway during the summer, the mischief he caused throughout his younger life, and the way that little changes in his life send him into new parts of the world. I personaly can not imagine life without a father, I had so much sypathy in this book for Dahl because he had no male parental mentor throughout his childhood, but his ability to lead a normal life was great. I enjoyed this book very much and found that it was easy to get into and easier to stay envolved, I would suggest it to anyone looking for a good book."
4,young dude story of a young author,"Boy is a book about Dahl's childhood. It involves Rolad' s funny ideas. It also has some serious moments, such as being hit by a cane. Dahl tells about his home, school, and friends. He also tells about a mean candy lady and about being homesick. I really liked the book although I don't read a lot of his books. I think it's a good read. I also think a lot of Dahl fans will like this book."
3,boy,This is an autobiography about some of roald dahls life up to high school.Its all the accidents and all the lies that he told so he didnt have to go to school.Roald Dahl had a painful experience with his nose .He went to Llandaff Cathedral school in wales he was very young when his dad died his teacher was mr coombs and he was very strict.
5,ROALD DAHL - A credit to his proffesion,"Roald Dahl's witty, hilariously funny, dramatic and sometimes sad autobiography is a reflection of an obviosly very well spent childhood. I'd like to read it again because everybody always misses some thing."
5,A really good book!,"Tells about Dahls childhood. From the great mouse plot, to his summer holidays in Norway. All the schools he attended to his first ride in a motor car. It's a great book."
4,"Really Good Book, But Not The Best","Boy By Roald Dahl I think that Boy, by Roald Dahl was a very good book. I think that it explained his young life in surprising detail. From his early child hood to his early adulthood!! He was part of many crazy antics, including pretending he was sick, all the way to putting goat dung in his sister's lover's pipe!! I think you really should read this book.Age group: All AgesVocabulary: Easy/MediumSize: Under 200 Pages"
5,"""Fascinating!""","Wow! I've always been a Roald Dahl fan, and have enjoyed many...unusual adventures from him. However, I really wanted to find out more about this author. I wanted to meet him, and reading this autobiography of his about his crazy childhood made me feel almost as if I were sitting right in Roald Dahl's presence, listening to him tell me all of these hilarious (well, it's not hilarious when Roald's father and sister die) MOSTLY hilarious occurances. I really recomend this book for you if you're a kid wanting to read a short book about something that's guaranteed to give you a good laugh. Maybe even if you're an adult you'd like to read something about one of the world's most fabulous story tellers ever."
4,"A often very funny, interesting, and shocking novel...","This piece of work by the classic children's author, Roald Dahl, is wonderful. It tells stories of young Dahl's life in boarding schools, summers on islands in Norway, and other adventures. Often, these stories are very humorous, and very interesting. But, sometimes, it's just plain shocking and unbelievable. Especially, when he gets to talking about his Headmasters and ""Masters"" (teachers) at his schools. I recommend this book to any real Roald Dahl fan. You'll not regret reading it."
5,The most grapefruity!,"The pink grapefruit gummies are far superior to the regular grapefruit ones; the flavor is much more intense. They are an addiction! Plus, all that gelatin makes my nails long and strong!"
5,Great flavor!,"If you like pink grapefruit, you will love this product! I am a huge pink grapefruit lover and I really didn't expect a lot when I decided to buy these and give them a try...THEY ARE INCREDIBLE!!!!!They look like a grapefruit section, and they are coated with sugar. These are delicious and would go great at any party or just to have as a little treat!Other people have said that they are good in small doses, but I wouldn't want more than 5-6 pieces at a time anyway, or else I would weigh 600 pounds! These are perfect to have around for a little treat for the kids or friends. I will definitely purchase these again!"
2,Sickly sweet,way too sweet. 2 or 3 is all I can manage in one go. make sure you try a small pack before buying the 5 pound bag!!!
1,The Consistency is Very Odd!,"I love Haribo Gold Bears and the Rolls of the disks, but the consistency of the Haribo Gummi Pink Grapefruit is very strange. It is similar to the sugared sliced fruit, but with hard pieces throughout. Some people love the sliced fruit candies, my husband does, but not me. Hopefully my husband will like these otherwise they will go to waste."
2,Stale grapefruit slices,"Unlike the Haribo grapefruit slices I have always received these are hard and less flavorful. I would decribe them as ""stale""."
3,ok - but in small portions only,"I completely liked these things --- BEFORE I got the gigantic 5lb bag. I'd actually prefer to keep them as a treat rather than something to just get sick of. After just a few, the taste gets worse and they are just way too gummy. I am already sick of them and have like 4.5 lbs left.Too bad they didn't have the small bags in stock when I got these."
5,So happy bought this DVD,I bought this DVD because my dog is getting up there in age and has some issues with arthritis. My dog was completely relaxed as I followed along with the instructor on the DVD. I had been going back and forth the last couple of months trying to decide if I should buy this DVD because of the price but I'm so happy I did.
2,Required for School,A bit one-sided when studying all avenues of Christianity. Not a favorite that I plan to keep when the class is completed.
5,Beautiful recording,"I bought this performance C.D. to sing for a church Christmas program this year. My friend of many years had asked if I would sing it; its her favorite and she's waited a long time to hear it sung.This is the first time I ever bought a Accompaniment/Performance Track through Amazon but I would definitely do it again. I was very pleased with the quality of this C.D. and the tempo was just what I was looking for. Not too fast; not to slow. And I'm always always looking for one that has the 3 different ranges; which this one did!! For those who want to know this- each one of the Tracks: High, Medium and Low were without the Back Ground Voices. I know some people want to have the Background voices to sing with; or at least the choice. But to tell the truth, it really was okay without them."
2,Dell W1700,I bought this through Tiger as a refurb unit. It lasted about 2.5 years of light duty usage before it crapped out. If I had known it was from Philips I wouldn't have bought it. I've not had good luck with Philips/Maganavox branded TV products.
5,Great tv...hdtv.....,"I bought this Lcd tv for my girlfriend for christmas..It has great picture, clear and crisp to the T. Easy as one to three to install. Wonderfull features such as picture and picture. One can watch one channel while waching another on the corner of the screen. You Also can be on the computer while watching tv..Sound is great and clear...If any one wants to see a Video of the tv..reach me a ramonparatu@hotmail.com"
2,Dell W1700 LCD TV Great Until It Dies,"This TV/computer monitor gave us great pleasure for 3 years, but then one night as I was speaking with my wife, it just went blank. Professional computer technicians confirmed that the only option I had was to send it back to Dell, who would kindly replace it for about $400.00. Well, these days, for $400, you can probably do much better. Sigh-oh-nara, Dell-sold, Phillips products."
3,"Basically a run-through, but at least they're pretty","I can't imagine in what way these would be considered desirable versions of Dvorak's extremely characterful Slavonic Dances. They certainly aren't Slavonic in Maazel's hands--there's not a hint of folk dance or Eastern European tang. These are simply comfortable run-throughs by a very good orchestra and a conductor marking time. Besides the classic Talich recording, which is the last word in genuine Czech flavor, there are extremely good CDs by Kubelik, Szell, and the recent Harnoncourt to consider. Compared to them, this one is a non-starter."
5,All Good,"I was very pleased with my product, the packaging the product was new, the cost was reasonable I received the package at my door by ups in a few days of ordering. Amazon made sure that my car parts fit my car by asking me questions about my car then telling me which car parts would fit my type and year of car because I did need all the help I could get, and I tried to stay within a budget with my car parts. Thank you Amazon and I thank the companies I purchased my car parts from."
4,Is there a warranty?,Installed them on my 2002 Pontiac Montana without any problems. The shipment arrived as expected. Bearing look like the old ones but now I know there are TImken bearing inside the hubs. I am curious if there's a warranty though.
5,"Sweet, very nice quality",I have bought many kinds of these in the last couple years and you can tell right away by looking at these that they are great quality!!
5,Timkin Bearing and Hob Assembly Buick Regal GS,"The products arrived in a timely manner. Installed on the front of my Buick Regal GS, and each is performing beautifully!"
5,Great Quality Bearings,"I'm an avid do-it-yourselfer, but not a bearing expert. These fixed the grinding coming from my original bearings on a 2001 Impala with 130k miles. I feel much better having solid, American built, guaranteed hardware between my family and the road than the cheaper Chinese imports that are only rated to last 20k miles or so. The small price difference is more than worth the peace of mind. Thanks Timken, I hope you guys can withstand the flood of lo-fi foreign parts."
1,reply to your querry about the hub and bearing i purchased from you,"this part was purchased but sent back because it was not the right part . you show the right part on your web page but said it would not fit my car i called timken to find out if the part 513179 would fit my car and they said yes but i was afraid to order from you because your page said it was not the right part, i e-mailed you this information and you said you would look into it. but in the mean time i purchased part #513179 from another mfg. and it fit perfectly! i periodically check your web page and see you still list it as not the ri9ght part for car, which is by the a 1995 buick lesabre"
5,Itt Works,"This was a shorter versign of what cam with my Sturmey archer hub that I lost, but it works fine for me with a weight savingnew shifting set up on my 3 speed."
2,Go play the game yourself.,"I guess my expectations of this book would be that I would learn about paintball history, tactics, and the evolution of paintball equipment all in the context of interesting paintball stories. Although there was a little of that, the book is really just a chronicle of the author's paintball experiences given in a diary like format. Some of the experiences were interesting but NOT that interesting. Unless you can't get out save your money and time and play a game of paintball yourself."
4,This one has it all....,"...sex, suspense, and the trademark Cabot humor. The characters in this book are much more believable and sympathetic--and nowhere near as lampoony--as they were in Cabot's last book, An Improper Proposal. I felt for and could identify with Kate. And Burke is a god. If you want a fast read that will tickle your funnybone as well as touch the heart, this is the one to go for."
1,DISAPPOINTING...,I have read all of Cabot's works and I was anxiously anticipating this book after I read her last book -An Improper Proposal. Sadly to say that I was highly disappointed with the book. I did not like the characters - Burke and Kate. There did not seem to be much chemistry with the two characters. Developing a romantic relationship was also a bit difficult with Burke's daughter - Isabelle in the story. Cabot's other books had characters with more spunk and heart. The story line was boring. I say take a pass on book.
1,BLAH!,"My friend got me hooked on Cabot with her last book which I enjoyed very much. This book was not her typical style. I really did not like either character much. He had way too much baggage - anger with ex wife for her betrayal so the rest of the women will take up where she left off, a daughter who is a handful, and a missing heart. I liked her other books when she concentrated more on developing the characters and showing their vulnerability without the trite baggage. Usually her characters have spunk -- something I did not see any of this in the book. All in all, I want my money back."
1,Save Your Money...,"I suggest that you save your money and pass on this book. I, too, enjoyed Cabot's previous works and was disappointed with her latest novel. The characters were boring and the story was flat. I just plain did not like anything about the book. The plot is an overused one with the hero finding his wife in bed with another man. He tosses man out window. He cannot trust woman. He raises his daughter....does this sound familiar? I hope her next book is better."
1,What Happened?,"I generally like Cabot's works. However, I could not warm up to Burke or Kate or the plot of the book. I thought the hero was much too violent and that the heroine had to work too hard to get to his heart. The plot also seemed very flat. I just plain did not enjoy this book as much as I did her other books."
1,BETTER LUCK WITH NEXT BOOK....,"I also tried to like this book because it sounded cute. I also liked her first book - Where Roses Grow Wild very much. I was hoping for a repeat peformance, but this book falls flat with both the character development and the plot. It was truly uninspiring and boring. I only finished the book because I spent good money on it. I am hoping I like the next book better."
4,Sultry Sounds of Ms. Badu,Badu certainly finds a niche in the music world with this album...people who like good music. This album contains songs that build on past successes of other artists but puts a pleasant spin on the sound. Certainly a good addition to a music collection.
4,Baduizm: A Very Groovy Philosophy Indeed,"Up there among the most innovative r&b albums of the 1990's (there haven't been many at all), Erykah Badu's ""Baduizm"" remains a touchstone of neo-soul. The talented Texan presented in 1997 her debut so full of compelling grooves seamlessly blending together that she was awarded the Best R&B Album Grammy and was featured in many polls on best albums of the year. It was deserved. Not ashamed of her Afro-American descent and offering a tapestry of her philosophies, the young singer/songwriter/musician however unleashed almost an hour of soothing grooooovy music, including Atlantic Starr cover ""4 Leaf Clover"" and stellar ""No Love"" and ""Sometimes"". ""Baduizm"" was never (and should never be) repeated anymore and it will at least for a time remain Badu's most representative long-player."
5,MY GIRL E.B.,"THIS WAS ONE OF THE HOTTEST ALBUMS OUT THAT YEAR. IT HELPED ME OUT ALOT GOING THROUGH MY UNBORN AND MENTALLY BEING BORN. IT FELT REALLY GOOD TO HERE THE THOUGHTS OF ANOTHER EARTHBODY BUILD ON THOUGHTS AND ASPIRATIONS THAT I WAS FORTHCOMING. THIS IS DEFINITELY ONE YOU WOULD BUY FOR A GIRLFRIEND, WIFE, OR DAUGHTER."
3,Badu will do,"3 1/2This noticeable debut can wear down a bit taken whole in some repetitious rhythms (and themes), though most were simply too focused on Badu's eccentric subtleties. Paired with its finely produced jazzy soul settings, and this vocalist offered a reputable fresh identity."
4,No title,I really enjoyed this album. I found that her live album of the same work was incredibly better! She's truly a great artist!
1,Mis-Advertisement,"I was looking to purchase ""BADUIZIM"" by Erykah Badu on Vinyl.However, I was sent a CD instead.Not Happy!This particular Retailer totally misadvertised their product offerings.I was totally pissed-off!!!TL"
1,Boring,"I had heard so many people say how good she was so, I bought the cd to see what everybody was talking about. I found her voice nice and soothing but after the first few songs I got really sleepy. I really don't understand why she has been nominated for so many awards."
1,"""Lacklusterism""","I really tried to like this CD, and I have to tell you that most music grows on me after time. But this proved to be the exception. It's hard to tell what Baduizm is which means it really does not qualify as an ""ism"". If it's new school, what kind of new school? Indeed, I found it to be an eclectic mix of styles and themes lacking a core identity. The tracks are melodically rudimentary and rhythmically flat. Weak attempts to borrow techniques from trip hop. The only oasis in an otherwise desert-like sonic landscape is track 7. Too much negativity to bring? Sorry, because overall, Baduizm lackluster musical experience."
5,this lil nappyheaded girl crushes them all with this one!,"""on & on"" was the first video i felt that i had to record! the song was powerful and the video was inventive and fun! badu had me hooked from the gate!so when the album came out, what did i do?what do you think i did! i ran out and bought it!! come on!to this day, badu and this album still have that magic to move a man to spiritually move beyond what it is he thinks a man should be....she came correct with this. this was like dr. j making the way for jordan....if you like neo-soul, this is the foundation!"
4,Strong Debut!,"Released in 1997 Baduizm became a big hit all over the world. 1997 was a year of both good and bad albums and this album is among the good ones. jazzy, soultry and R&B ish . Baduizm becomes one of my personal favourites of the 1990's. Just an album that everyone should have and suits for everyone. Badu vocal ranges and creativity and her style is represented here in her beautiful and powerful debut album. the music just puts smile of people. Every fan of music should own this album. It is brilliantly made and made to peace and smooth our soul. great work."
5,Excellent,A bit late on the reviews for this album having owned it for nigh on five years. Does it deliver? It was certainly new and refreshing back in '97 and it is still great listening today. One of the best albums of recent years and it just left you wanting more which she has delivered on Mamma's Gun her last release.I could go on and review every track but I think everyone else has done a great job here and suffice to say I can't add any more superlatives. Essential listening and if you get the chance to see her live then take it.
4,"great, jazzy easy listening","All of my friends were raving about 'Baduizm' so I bought the CD. I absolutly love it. It's great, jazzy easy listening - she deserves all the awards and nominations she has been getting."
4,Refreshing,"What Badu has brought to the masses is refreshing. This cd is a jazz, hip hop, soul influenced masterpiece. Not only is her image positive but her lyrics have meaning. Other Side of The Game explores the dilema and consequences of a relationship plagued by the boyfriend's not so legal occupation ...""work ain't honest but it pays the bills."" Certainly is sprinkled with melodic keyboards and breaks into an alluring, jazzy, walking base line that sets the groove for Badu to gently remind you of who is in control ...""the world is mine when I wake up I don't need nobody tellin me the time."" This cd introduced the mainstream to talented, intelligent, creative, self satisfied Black women of the 90's and beyond. We can finally welcome the long line of more to come. I highly recommend this cd and look forward to her next release."
3,Great Album! Item NOT as described.,"Erykah is amazing, and all of her albums are excellent.HOWEVER, Amazon failed to disclose that the item is NOT as pictured. As a few other reviews had said, it does not come in the standard sleeve with album art work. Its simply in a black sleeve with a sticker on the front listing the tracks. No where on the description does it say that it comes in a nondescript sleeve. Very misleading."
2,Not the original cover,"This record came in a plain black sleeve, not the original cover. While the sound is good that aspect is disappointing."
5,Long over due,I bought this CD finally and was extremely happy with it. I have been going back and forth about purchasing and i'm glad i did. The delivery was fast and I love the cd :)
2,Amazon Please Fix This Listing,"I should have read the reviews before purchasing, as I too was disappointed to receive the LP in a plain black jacket with a sticker listing the tracks only. No cover art. Why would the label do this? Anyway, Amazon needs to correct the image on this listing to stop misleading its customers. Fortunately, I purchased this LP on sale here for a little over six bucks so it's worth keeping."
4,Fantastic Debut Album,"I consider this album one of the top r&b soul albums of the 90's. I still pull out my CD case and pop it in, and groove to the songs and the whole progression of her work. Yes there are a couple of missteps, but this album shows the promise of the artist. If you are into Badu now, reflect on where she has been and see that her talent has progressed and continues to push envelopes."
4,very good debut,"this is another great album to listen to when you want to chill out or clean the house to. even though she doesn't have the strongest voice, her lyrics and sound bring something new to music."
5,You dont like RnB if u dont like this,"Good album how couldnt u like this, this is RnB at its best sit back and unwind to this, smoke a black n mild 2 this, make love to this, smooth mellow beats courtesy of the Roots good calm relaxing voice by Erykah....Does it get any better?"
1,Baduizm,nothing to write home about. Lot of rap style rifts but nothing that challenged her vocally.
2,Quality control has left the building,"This is the first and only mediocre hellcat release I've purchased, and I own all of the record label's albums. The music just seems undeveloped and tired. The vocals are lackluster, and the lyrics are sub par. Even the song Tim Amrstrong guest stars on is short and weak. His lines are short and he hardly adds to the song. Just go to youtube and watch the video for ""I hate emo"" and you'll not want to buy this album. Not because hating emo is lame, but because it's just a poor undeveloped song by amatuers. C'mon Hellcat, sign some talent so I don't lose faith."
2,Bad remaster,"The original recordings of these tracks are phenomenal. The remastered tracks on this particular CD are horrendous. If you plan to use these tracks for any critical listening application, don't buy this disc! Digital distortion-a-go-go."
1,Only 14 tracks ?????????,If this 14 track collection is the only one released in the USA it is a scorn against all the US fans.In Europe we got a 32 track doubble set to the price of a single cd. I really cannot understand this unjust.The responsible publisher should be ashamed.
2,Bizarre single disk version.,"I noted the previous review on this compilation, and had a double take. I have the album and it is a double disk set. However, and quite strangely, it does not include the track ""On the run"", which is included in this single disk version. Not that any self respecting Toto fan wouldn't have it on it's original Toto XX album release. You can't knock the content, except that some tracks are edited versions. It is the packaging that scores so low. If you must buy it, look for the double disk set."
5,"Well, I'm happy, anyways","I am a decided of fan of well crafted and carefully thought out and arranged music, and this CD did not disappoint."
4,Missing some songs,"Like all compulations, this one is still missing some songs. I feel more and more that the only way to get what I want is to handpick each song and make my own disk."
4,Memories,Great songs from an era long missed!!! Highly recommend purchasing this album to anyone who grew up in th 1970s and 1980s
5,Great gift from Uncle Bill,"My daughter was delighted to receive this lovely book for Christmas. She totally enjoyed seeing her old friend Winnie the Pooh given the honor of being translated into classical form. It was a great idea for the author to re-create this book, and to continue to perpetuate an interest in Latin. Nice find!"
3,winnie ille pu,"Most people who only know a little Latin should hopefully be able to understand Winnie Ille Pu. The ending has a 'notes' section where unusual phrases such as 'scire velim' are listed under their respective chapters for easy reference.There is something a bit more elegant about the Latin of Winnie Ille Pu compared to Fabulae Mirabiles, but that is caused by the differing genres of the writings. However, Fabulae Mirabliles would be my choice for the Latin beginner."
5,A sweeping English family saga,"If you like romance, with a hint of mystery, and sweeping family sagas, this is the one for you. I couldn't put it down. It goes smoothly between present day and Edwardian England. I purchased this from the UK Amazon, on the recommendation of a friend in England. Glad to see it is now available here."
5,you guys rock,"i don't know why i am the first reviewer for mf666, but then again i don't think anyone in this ignorant town knows who they are. good music to listen to when you are feeling like you want to listen to something different then what you hear on the radio 24/7"
4,The Exit Club: The Ultimate Novel of the SAS,"I picked this up a few weeks ago while vacationing in Florida at my mum's communal poolside library. As a former soldier and having worked with one or two SAS NCOs, I picked it up and finished it within a few weeks. It's a long read, just over 700 pages. It rang true from what I know and have been told. It pulls you in quickly and you just have to find out what happens to Marty the main character. I have read many military books both fiction and not. I consider this a good story, fairly well written and engaging to the end. Had it contained more operational type information and missions I think I would have been happier. However, I recommend the book and will be reading more of his works as I try to find out more about the author and where he gets his ""inspiration""."
1,Light and easily warped,"I was hoping this would be a good multi purpose baking pan. However, during the first batch of cookies I was making on it, it warped so violently that it flipped the outer edge cookies over.Model they are selling is Wear-Ever 5314.Would not recommend this pan for baking."
1,Quality drops after outsourcing,"I purchased four of these a year or so ago after reading a recommendation for them in Cook's Illustrated. They are beautiful - smooth, sturdy, no flaws in design at all, and priced reasonably. I ordered an additional one recently, same brand, same model, and the rims are rolled under and open instead of rolled under completely. The edges of the rolled rims on the new pan are sharp. Food and oils can collect under the rims and it would take a very small brush or pipe cleaner to keep clean. The pan feels cheaper. I returned it. The first four were made in Fort Wayne, Indiana. The recent one was made in China."
1,Watch out! NOT the recommended pan!,"The pan I received warps at 400 degrees and above. On the back is stamped Wear Ever 5314. I contacted Lincoln directly and I was told that they do manufacture Wear Ever but it is obviously the inferior product. They are sending me their 5303 pan which has a concavity and bead wire per their description, and is non-warping because of this. The Amazon order was fulfilled by a third party retailer and I apologize that I do not have the name with me, except that it contained the word ""Gourmet"". I suspect America's Test Kitchen tested the 5303 pan. If you order by clicking this link you may have the same problem."
1,Mine warped too,"I too purchased this pan because it was recommended by Cook's Illustrated. 10 minutes in a 400 degree oven was all it took to warp my pan. I called the company and they agreed to take them back. They are paying for return shipping, but we'll see if they reimburse me for the shipping I paid to have them delivered to me...Tip: Go to your local restaurant supply store. They are bound to have half-size heavy duty sheet pans for half the price, and no shipping charges!"
1,Disappointed!,"As some have stated previously, this pan warps! I also purchased this pan due to it being recommended by Cook's Illustrated and having purchased other items that they have recommended I was sure it would be fantastic (as all others have been), but after using it just a few times, I was disappointed to see that it had warped. I have used it mostly to make biscuits in a 475 degree oven and the pan is now so seriously warped and I am seriously frustrated at that. I would try another pan that Cook's Illustrated recommends as I do not believe this pan is worth your money."
1,sheet pan warped,"I bought this sheet pan because it was rated the highest at Cooks Illustrated. I cooked Pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving @350 degrees. I placed the pie on this pan to prevent spills. It warped in the first 3 minutes and my pie filling jumped out of the shell- This pan certainly did not perform to the ""Cook's standard""."
4,Good as you can get nowadys,"I have two pans that I inhereeted from my Mother and never appreciated them until I bought this ""Cooks Illustrated"" best rated pan. Don't get me wrong, it is a good heavy pan that does not warp like a cheap one from a discount store, but it is not near as good or heavy as the one I got from my Mother who cooked professionally. I guess ""they don't make them like that anymore"""
5,haevy-duty,"I haven't used this sheet pan yet, but it is definitely heavy-duty, restaurant quality. Arrived quickly."
5,Essential Baking Sheet,"If you are looking for a professional quality baking sheet, this is it. I had one of these years ago that got lost in a move and recently purchased another to bake some cookies. Still the same great product and my cookies came out perfectly! TIP: I line the baking sheet with parchment paper before baking. No need to further butter or grease the pan and clean up is a snap!"
5,Nice pan,"I had wanted a good cookie pan for awhile. Read a review about it, that cookies baked evenly and browned nicely. All true. Glad I decided to buy it."
3,Edges aren't rolled?,"Although these pans are heavy duty and exactly what I expected in that aspect, I'm very disappointed in the edges- they aren't rolled under all the way. They look rolled from the top, but slide your finger underneath and you'll be worrying about getting cut! Every time I pull one out I'm disappointed all over again. Boo for skipping such an elemental step! For this price, I expect a clean edge."
2,Very Nice...but not all that!,"I really do love this pan, but it bowed the second time I used it....(I was able to bend it back when it was still hot)...but was still a disappointment. Not sure that I would purchase another one because of that. Regardless of what prior comments say, commercial heavy duty pans should NOT bow."
3,buckled!,I bought this pan upon the recommendation of America's Test Kitchen. In their review they said this sturdy pan will not buckle... First time use I roasted vegetables in the oven at 450 F and what did the pan do? It buckled and warped!!! Otherwise a nice solid pan.
1,Possible defective manufacturing,"I bought this pan which I thought and still hope is a Lincoln Foodservice Sheet Pan, the one identified in Cooks magazine. The stamp on the back says Wearever, which apparently Lincoln makes.After one use and the pan in the oven at 400 degrees for less than 3 minutes, the pan warped! Not only that, it is still warped and will not straighten out. Maybe Cooks Magazine had the one and only pan that did not warp, or there is a problem with the manufacturer.DC"
1,DECEPTIVE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION,"WARNING - this product is represented as the heavy duty, 13 gauge Vollrath 5314 pan which was the Cooks Illustrated favorite, but it is NOT. I received (from JB ONG, INC., fulfilled by Amazon) the Vollrath 5303 pan, which is thinner 18 or 19 gauge steel, and not at all a good value at this price. Returned as not matching the item description."
5,Outstanding Product,I was surprised at the thickness and durability of these sheet pans. They are extremely durable and definately do not warp with even the most intense heat. The gauge is so thick that it sounds like a solid cooking pan when you knock on the back of it! You will not be dissapointed by these.
5,Great Pan!,My wife love the first two pans I bought from you and asked for two more. They are heavy grade pans and great for a number of things no just for baking cookies even though they are fantastic for that.
3,Pan less than terrific,"This pan looks great: large, with good sides, as if it could do any number of chores. It probably can, but the one chore I most need it for--broiling--seems beyond it. It buckles, so that a quarter of it rises and tips its contents. However, it washes easily, and will even fit in the dishwasher, if necessary."
1,This Pan Warps!,"This pan warps! The 13 gauge from Amazon did not fare well. I got mine in yesterday and tried it in a 500 degree oven to find it warped badly! I was doing the roasted pear recipe from Cook's Illustrated which calls for you to preheat the baking sheet prior to placing the pears tossed with butter and sugar. It warped after the first use! I was very disappointed as I bought this pan after Cook's Illustrated rated it as its top recommended pan. Cook's Illustrated said the ""search was over"" and that this pan does not warp. Well mine warped after the first use! I posted pictures of the pan in the customer images for all to see. The picture of my warped pan says it all."
5,Made in USA,"This pan is exactly what I wanted; no coating, heavy with rounded edges. I've used it a couple of times already and was pleased."
3,Not so great,"I bought two of these pans because of ATK recommendation. For the price I expected better quality. Right out of the box one pan was good, the other was warped like it just came out of a 500 degree oven. They should have been ashamed to ship it."
3,"good pan but, WARNING NOT DISHWASHER SAFE","I like the pan and it works as advertised. My wife unfortunately put it in the dishwasher with Trader Joe's environmentally friendly dish detergent and it came out with a mosaic blackened pattern, as if tarnished."
5,Was recommended by Cook's Illustrated,I ordered a couple of these after reading the recommendation in Cook's Illustrated. They have lived up to the review. Heavy duty and great for even heat conduction.
3,"Solid pan, but...","Warped the first time I used it. A little peeved since this is one of the big reasons I bought this pan.Otherwise solid, sturdy sheet."
1,Arrived Warped. . . Twice,"Purchased mine from KATOM.com restaurant supply, not from amazon. Thought I would review anyways. Bottom line is that the first one arrived warped. Their Customer service was great and contacted the manufacturer to send me another one. Still arrived warped!!! Very sturdy pan being 13 gauge but quality control sucks. Maybe i am just unlucky but I doubt it. I was looking forward to getting the pan as it was the CI recommended, but it was a total dud."
2,Not so great,this pan warped in the oven with seldom use. Although it's still usable it's pretty annoying that this would occur.
2,not what I expected,"This is not what I expected. Metal edges are rough, finish is bad, I would not purchase another one of these pans."
3,"Good Pan, But . . .","This is a heavy duty pan, but it did warp the first time I used it in an oven. I, too, followed the recommendation of Cook's Illustrated to buy this pan because ""Pan can't be twisted, did not warp."" Well, at a mere 425 degrees the pan did warp."
2,half-rolled edges,The half-rolled edges (open for cleaning) had too sharp an edge. Otherwise the pan was as described.Hurts my fingers when holding by the edges. returned.
5,Christ as Human,The Last Temptation of Christ provokes an idea that I've often questioned; was Christ really a radical Rabi who died on the cross only to rise from the dead in the words of the so-called prophets? I think there may be some truth to this fiction.
2,Didn't Satisfy any of the Reasons I read a Book,"I was blown away by the movie years ago, and curious to see what the book would be like. For me, personally it was disappointing because Jesus was not only not the person I believe he was, he was actually unlikable in the book. I believe he was fully human while on earth, but it seemed Kazantzakis went too far in giving his character traits that bordered on irritating. I like for the book I'm reading to either teach me something, be passionate enough to involve me deeply, inspire me, or just be plain enjoyable for no reason I can put my finger on. This book may hit the mark for some, but it didn't do it for me."
5,The Last Temptation,"For everyone who believes in some kind of God, but doesn't know why,or how...This book will blow your mind away."
3,The Last Temptation of Christ,"While the item itself is in great shape, I found the shipping/handling charges to to be way out of line for the amount of time it took to get the book."
4,The Way Things Were or Probably Should Be,"Never has the story of Christ been told so vividly or with such sensitivity as it's told here. In all of the stories I've ever heard about Jesus, he has always seemed too holy, too pure for me to ever relate to. In this book, Kazantzakis portrays Christ as all too human, making his suffering and sacrifice all the more meaningful. This is a weighty book, chock full of symbolism, but is well worth the trouble, even if it's just to remind yourself what Christ was truly about, before all the disciples and churches misinterpreted everything."
3,"Great idea, difficult to read.","Kazantzakis explores the humanity of Christ and really focuses on how difficult human life must have been for Jesus. The story of Christ becomes even more beautiful when one realizes how difficult the temptation of sin must have been on him. This is an incredible story...but I had immense difficulty reading this book.Kazantzakis wrote this story in Greek, and maybe the problem is in the translation. The Greek, I assume, probably flows with ease and is easy to read. The english translation is choppy, and problematic. I really found Kazantzakis' style to be very uneven, very choppy, and very tedius. Once again, I believe the problem is within the translation.When a new translation comes out, I will be the first to buy it."
4,integrity,"I must confess that although I had not seen the ""controversial"" movie, I had had preconceptions based on the reputations of the movie prior to reading this book. Boy, I think this book is very passionate and respectable toward the Gospel, and frankly there is nothing ""controversial"" in my opinion. If nothing else, it shows the perfect Son of Man side of the duality, and unlike rather the sado-masochistic movie ""Passion of Christ"", this book should bring the readers closer to the understanding of and participation in the mental sufferings of Jesus Christ. A very good read."
5,Should be an all-time classic.,"To think, that the critics have called this blasphemy? This book is ground-breaking both in its perspective and psychological analysis of the figure that is Christ. Be sure to read the preface, written by Kazantzakis...it's very moving."
4,"Elegant, soulful writing.","Exquisite, tender writing. I tend to favor works that have female protaganists, but no matter the subject the writing is so gorgeous... my favortite fictional book because of the sheer beauty of the prose."
2,"I wanted to get into it, but I couldn't.","A stand up comic once said ""you know what was best about the movie? NO READING!!!!"" I love reading, but when it came to this book, I just couldn't get into it at all. It just dragged on. The movie dragged on as well, but at least the movie was somewhat interesting. I gave it a fair chance though, but I just couldn't get into it, so obviously it's not for everybody."
1,"Beautiful voice, poor selections.","Most of these pieces would be ""interesting"" in the context of a concert hall, but they were waaaaayyyyy to ""out there"" for home listening. Too bad, because both artists are/ were extraordinary talents."
2,Kind of Disappointing,"I bought this book because I have another by the same authors that is excellent. However, this one is not nearly as good. Nine of the patterns are for very basic, non-jointed bears, with only two patterns for jointed bears.This might be a good book for a complete beginner, but if you have much experience or want to make jointed bears, I would pass on this one."
1,Mytery Classics Vol 5,I started watch this DVD and through it out.I thought it was a very poor quality.
5,Krishnamurti's Notebook review,"If Krishnamurti's writing resonates with you, this book is essential. It is a view into the nature of everything. Beautifully written, a must read for anyone with an interest in authentic meditation, yoga, Zen or true religion. This book is a treasure - I cannot believe it is out of print. I am also amazed at the number of meditation and yoga practitioners I meet that have never heard of J Krishnamurti. Check out [...] for free video/audio recordings."
2,Seems like a great deal but very poor quality,"After using the product for less than a year, one of the bands snapped and caused a small injury as the rubber hit my skin. The rubber looks like it is weakening around some areas...mainly near the handles. I wouldn't recommend this product for long term use as the other bands look like they're about to snap too. I think its a waste of money."
1,Don't Buy This!!!,"I am a relatively active and healthy runner, 36 at the time of using this. The deep knee lunges actually were the catalyst for a knee injury that has lasted a year. DO NOT DO THESE EXERCISES. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT unless you want to injure your knee(s)."
1,Definitely not the best Scottish Romances!,"As an avid book-reader, especially romances set in genre, I was very disappointed with Highland Jewel. I spent so much time trying to figure out what the characters were saying and how it related to the story-lines that after 90 pages, I was ready to give up.Hero, the lead female of the book, was so uppidy and self-centered that I was hoping the story would lead to another ""hero""ine coming to the aid of Ciaran.I recommend Julie Garwood's books for anyone looking for a romance set in this time period."
2,Jay Buchanan?,"Not sure what to make of this guy, seems to be a lot of stir about him, but in my opinon, I don't see it! Nothing more then another John Mayer! And I ask you how many John Mayer's do we need! Sorry just didn't find this gut very interesting."
3,"Not bad, but no market for it.","This is a pretty decent album, the artists play well, and Palmer sings as well as he does anywhere. I give them all credit for putting this album out, as they had to have known there was no real market for this kind of music (and there still isn't.) It's polished rock by veteran players who know what they are doing, but had no hope whatsoever of having a radio hit. If this had been released in 1988, She Can Rock It and a couple other songs might have dented the Top 40, but at this point, even Rush only sells albums to Rush fans, and this music is fairly similar to what they do. I think Andy Taylor is the only musician in this version of the band that's actually still alive, which is too bad."
3,Missing the Signature Sound,"Missing the signature sound (specifically on the drum production), this one falls short of greatness.The songs are mostly good, and Palmer's voice is great all the way through, but without their signature ""big"" sounding unique drum sounds which were present on the first album, this one sounds musically like any other generic rock act."
2,ONE OF THE WORST albums EVER,"It's hard to believe these are the same dudes that made the classic 1985 debut album one of the most memorable of the 80's.""Living in fear"" however, is poorly written, un-inspired, and uneven.Bernard Edwards played bass on this one, and even THAT didn't save the album from being one of the worst ever made, by any artist.Stay away from this one!The melodies won't make a bit of sense to you."
5,Exactly what we wanted.,We wanted a sturdy hoop with easy height adjustment and this is EXACTLY what we wanted. Really sturdy (filled with water and it withstood heavy winds without even the slightest wobble) and our boys (age 7 and 10) can both adjust the height. Husband assembled it with help from 10 year old in 3 hours. VERY happy with this product and highly recommend it.
4,"Good product, but needs much better packaging and shipping!","The item and price were good. But as other reviewers have said before, the backboard came in scratched due to lack of proper packaging. Needed 2 hours, and 2 adults to assemble. A good set of tools helps too!"
4,"Very good product, hard to assemble","Nice hoop. Solid construction and a nice big backboard. It's great for my 10-year old and I can lower it for my 7-year old as well. It was not very easy to put together. I'm fairly handy and spent a good 3+ hours wrestling with this thing. There are a lot of pieces and some of them are difficult to get togetheer because the positioning is awkward. Once you get it assembled though, it works great! I was happy that all pieces were included and there were no problems."
5,Great for the price,"Reitterate all of the positive comments below. My shippment came intact with no parts missing. You can assemble without any help (I did). You will need a sturdy box or a low table to place the backboard on when you are attaching it to the pole and be sure you have exactly the right tools, including box and ratchet wrenches. Filling the sand takes a long time. This does go faster with two people, one pouring the sand into a funnel (get an automotive funnel and chop it off to create a larger opening) and someone to ram the sand through the hole. It would not take 400lbs of sand, so I added a few gallons of water for extra weight. Do not use the all water option - the anti-freeze you would have to buy is very expensive if you live in a cold climate and the risk of developing a leak and having the board fall on someone is not worth it. Have fun."
2,Worked for a while . . .,"My Lifetime 1558 worked well enough until tragedy struck . . .The system was blown over by a strong wind even though the base is full of sand. The rim landed on the court and was bent. More importantly, the frame was bent where the rim connects to the backboard. Now the rim is angled upwards at 30 degrees and is horribly out of round.Lifetime customer service doesn't offer any repair advice for ""liability reasons"" or provide repair service. The two replacement parts are expensive, two-thirds the cost of the original purchase. I'm just not sure I want to invest more in a system that was so easily damaged."
3,Very difficult to install,"Had seen this & similar hoops in numerous homes & finally decided to buy one for myself. Got it at a good price, but 1st package did not look like brand new (re-packaged). Then, very difficult to install and even though being an engineer (maybe that could be the reason!!) the directions need to be followed very carefully and you need at least 2 string adults. Total time spent around 4 hours, with couple of mistakes that required dis-assembly and assembly again. Final last steps are tricky with no mention of optimal way of placing the poles & backboard & I ended up bending the entire backboard. Backboard also had some scratches and even though Amazon was nice enough to allow a free return, I did not have the heard to dismantle the whole unit and package it back.Not a happy experience and on hind sight, would rather pay a professional and get an in-ground unit. Overall quality of end product is decent (cannot ask for more for price)."
5,great bball hoop,"If you fill the base completely with sand, this is very sturdy. looks great and i love what it can be moved if we want."
3,"great product, poor packaging",The goal came in with a damaged box. We had chips and nicks in the paint on the poles. It appears I will need to touch up with rust resistant paint. The pole pad was also missing. The product seems to be good quality for the money
4,Decent for the money,"Took 3.5-4 hours to assemble on my own- much easier with a helper. Directions are ok but could be better- bigger diagram would help- read then carefully! Once up hoop works great. Only issue is base could be counter balanced better- it tips over when base is empty, this makes filling it with water a 2-person job- Or stand on it while it fills. Sand is harder to remove and so I opted for water in the event I need to move the hoop around."
4,Sturdy System,"It took some effort to get it together but once complete it seems to be holding up well. Make sure you have a funnel to fill the base with dry sand. It says it will hold 325 lbs of sand and it does, almost exactly.The height adjustment if very easy. My kids are able to adjust the height on their on easily."
4,Good for younger computer users,They played I Spy with their Grammy and loved it at her house so I tried to find the same one...turns out this is not the same one but this is a very easy one. It says 5-9 on the box but my daughter is 4 and she has it mastered. She loves playing it and being on the computer. I think it is a great introductory game if you are trying to get your child on the computer by themselves.
5,Magnificent,"Words cannot convey my reaction for this book. I couldn't put it down, and I would find myself waking up at 1:00 A.M. and I wouldn't go back to bed but read this book. You ought to read this book. Bravo!"
5,captivating,"In his first novel, Charles Gershon masterfully unfolds a multilayered mystery. Accompanied by a variety of well developed characters, the reader travels a tightly connected landscape through South Georgia to Nazi Germany, almost to Palestine, and back again to the rich and textured world of the deep south. Across time and several continents, Gershon has woven a fascinating story of intrigue. Laced with moral dilemmas, this page-turner is a very satisfying read. Bravo to Gershon for this spot-on first effort."
4,EH,"We bought this crib at BabiesRus. Luckily, it was on stock (no waiting, damage from shipping and shipping fees...). Like the previous reviewer said, there are some visible nail holes and a fingure print left on the paint. No big deal, but not the kind of finishing touch for the price. That is my only complain. Really easy to assemble (less than 30 min). The drop side is also easy to operate with one hand. Just lift the side a bit and push the bottom piece with knee and it drops. It would give 5 stars if the finish was perfect!"
5,Health Care,"Met expectations...I don't have any more words that I can add. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight etcc."
1,Real-time battles - a shortfall,"A strategy war game without real-time battles is not for me. The TOTAL WAR concept is my idea of the ideal strategy war game - a strategy ""board"" game with battles in real time."
2,Response to Chessboa,"Even though i have yet to play this game, most other Matrix games are low budget and low quality. That is why i rate it 2 stars.To most people, hex-style, or 2D games are very uninviting and aren't the fast action shooters that use graphics to grab your attention. The best game that i have played is Hearts of Iron, by Strategy First. This game, although 2D, is the most strategic and fun to play game i have ever played, but it doesnt have a ton of fans due to the low-end graphics."
3,Not the best dental tape,"This is not the best dental tape and, for the money, not that much better than regular floss, in my experience. The best dental tape I've tried is Jason Tea Tree Oil dental tape, which is available in health food stores but can be hard to find.If you do decide to buy any of the dental tapes offered on Amazon, you might do better to order them directly from drugstore.com, where (at this writing) they cost less."
4,This was very much like all the other ...,"This was very much like all the other dental tapes I've tried. It was also more expensive. Unless this was on sale, I wouldn't purchase it, because I didn't feel a difference between this brand and the cheapest brands."
5,I love Glide Dental Tape. The tape is ...,"I love Glide Dental Tape. The tape is thin but wider than regular dental floss. It's easy to use and doesn't break. That's important for those of us with tight contacts between our teeth. It has a cool, minty taste. This product really left my teeth and gums feeling refreshed and clean. I'd highly recommend Glide Dental Tape. In fact, after reviewing this product, I have decided this is floss I'll be using from now on."
3,Not as sharp as the original,"Definitely not as good as the original. However, if you want an 80's throwback night, this film is harmless enough. It's fun, just don't expect classic."
1,Terrible DVD production values for a great film,"With a newly restored version of Things to Come out there is no reason to ever buy this disk. The film reproduction is terrible, almost unwatchable. There are no extras worth mentioning. Just short essays on topics like 'science fiction' you can read on the screen and a trivia quiz.As for the B side film 'Journey to the Center of Time' it may be the worst film ever made and is not even worth seeing to make fun of.Give this disk a miss."
4,I just wish it were even longer!,"This is a blast! It's a lot of fun watching footage from the 70s and seeing how similar life in Orange County is today. I'm praying for a revival in our generation! This is encouraging more than anything because it shows that a faithfulness to God's Word and doing what it says can be so blessed by the Lord. It is good to remember times like these, but it is even better to take a stand here and now and then watch God work in people's lives today. It is also funny seeing some of the people from the footage now at church on Sundays...haha. This is really cool, I wish it were longer!"
2,Shattered dreams...,"It is a very lovely two piece set. And Amazon shipped it to me twice, and both times it arrived in more or less a pile of shards. I gave up, but from what I could tell from the remains, this set is a very nice heavy earthen bakewear. I'm not sure, considering the shipping problems, whether the set could survive normal jostling in storage cabinets or a dishwasher."
4,covered dishes,"first set was broken-be careful opening, I cut myself. Second set came immediately-and they are good dishes."
2,"Nice set, but one came broken","As two other reviewers mentioned this is a nice set. Unfortunately when it arrived, the larger bowl had a chip on the rim and under closer inspection you can see it is starting to crack from there in two lines. I'm going to try to have it replaced and will let you know how it goes. I've been very happy with the other corelle pieces I've gotten, but have also had a problem with the 3Qt Baking Dish that is also made of the same material as these bowls that arrived broken as well that I'm also having replaced."
1,Toy Did Not Work!,"I purchased this give for my 3 year old grandson. I had looked at it on line way before Thanksgiving and decided this was the perfect gift for this little energetic boy. On the evening of December 23, 2011, I put the batteries in it and set it up. It did not work. I went out and bought new batteries, but that did not do the trick. The toy was defective. Will be sending it back tomorrow. Unfortunately, I had to run out Christmas Eve to find another gift, and he was no way as excited as he would have been with the original toy I bought him."
2,Disappointed,"Great concept and good exercise for indoor play during winter.But, my 5 and 3 year old knock off the bar every time they jump over it.After only 5 min. of use, it is making a buzzing sound already.We are very disappointed with the product."
1,Should have listened to the reviews,"An eternal optimist, I read but ignored the reviews about this item sometimes not working straight out of the box. That's exactly what happened to us. I tried 4 sets of batteries, screwing and unscrewing, all while my 3 year old patiently (and then not so patiently) waited for her Christmas present to come to life. I can really only blame myself, but seriously, how are they still selling these things? Don't make the same mistake!"
5,"We have had hours of fun, and healthy exercise too.","Our kids-- ages toddler to preteen-- have had hours of fun jumping over the slowly spinning bar, for over a week. Also, when they accidentally jumped on top of the bar, it did not break, and could be quickly reassembled, after falling off the center rotator. Although sometimes the toy just seemed like it was not working, actually placing the plastic bar firmly down into the center groove, and pressing the correct button long enough to hear the minimum number of beeps, soon got it spinning and playing music again."
3,Nice idea for older kids,"I bought this as a gift for my 4 y/o nephew, after reading what great reviews it got. When we put it together, none of the kids at the party (aged 2-4) seemed to be able to use it. The younger ones were very interested, but would run into it, which would knock the plastic arms off and cause the game/music to stop. Then an adult would have to restart it, only to have the same thing happen OVER and OVER and OVER again. The 4 year old said ""what is it?"" and was completely disinterested. I was very disappointed, especially since the product was ""lost"" in transit and arrived a week AFTER my nephew's birthday party ... so he was waiting in anticipation for this disappointing gift."
1,Didn't buy,"I was very interested in this toy for my granddaughters but after reading the reviews, decided not to. It looked to me like it worked better and was built better back in 2009 but in 2012 there were no good reviews for it. A shame because it would be great for the girls."
5,Fun Fun Fun,"Our kids and the neighborhood kids love this. They jump, hop and run to try to prevent knocking it off the base. Lots of giggles. The 3 speeds are great so the younger kids can join in or the older kids can have more of a challenge."
5,Super Skipper=Super Fun,"I first saw this toy at a neighbor's house. Her 5 and 3 year old enjoyed it. The adults even got a laugh trying to not tap the spinning rod as they jumped over it. So, then I bought it for our cousin for his 4th birthday and found the adults getting a good laugh along with the birthday boy ! I think it is a good active toy and very good for developing physical coordination. The birthday boy's 18 ms old brother even tried it and laughed at the wheh-whah sound it makes when the rod is displaced. It's different and it's fun--kids keep trying to be successful at not displacing the rod."
4,Fun toy for indoors,"I bought this for a Christmas present for my almost 3 year old. He can't really jump over the rods yet on his own but he likes chasing them and running in circles. His six year old brother likes it a lot too so I think this toy will get used frequently. Plus, it works as well on thick pile carpet as it does on hardwood floors.I was surprised to see so many bad reviews for this. This toy will not turn on if the rods are improperly seated in the base. The toy will also turn off if the rods are knocked loose during play. It took a few ""Mom, it's broken!""s before I figured it out and I wonder if that may have been the issue for some of the reviewers. I'm guessing it's to keep kids from tripping or slipping on it if it falls off the base?"
1,Ditto--doesn't work,"This was a Christmas gift for my 3 year old and 2 year old sons. We tried three sets of batteries, but it never worked. If you don't like to return products (and you don't like having disappointed kiddos), pass on this one."
1,Don't buy!,"Toy never worked! The company even sent out a replacement, and that one didn't work either! So wished it did, looked like so much fun!"
1,junk!,My girls were so excited over this toy. First one didn't work. THought I would give them another try and the second one never worked either. My girls are still carrying it around lamenting that it doesn't work!
1,Didnt work!,"Unfortunately, this is another reviewer who's toy didn't work at all. My kids were so disappointed! A piece of cheap junk!"
1,Product doesn't work,"I opened the box, tried 2 sets of new batteries and item did not work. Apperantly this company ""kidoozie"" has shipped many of these toys broken."
3,The super skipper,"This super skipper is alot of fun for the small ones but if they land on the plastic arms that they jump over, the arms bend and messes up the balance of the toy."
1,Dead on delivery - TWO times! Don't buy it.,"I ordered the super skipper. It didn't work at first. It turned out that it actually started when you pressed the On-button and the speed selection button at the same time. Not sure if that is intentional. It worked for about 5 minutes, then it died. Taking my chances I returned it and ordered another one. I just unpacked it. This one is totally dead. Batteries are brand new."
1,This company should have to answer to all the duds they sold,Bought this for my 4 year old twins. And I am sure you can guess my next comment after reading the other reviews. The toy never worked....total dud. Sending it back!!!!
1,Doesn't Work,"I'd give it a 0 if I could. This toy did not work at all, and based on the reviews it seems I'm not the only one who has had this problem. Will be sending it back, but seriously how does a company get away with sending out a product that flat out does not work?"
1,Disappointed,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my nephew and was so embarrassed as the toy was broken up receiving it!
1,Piece of Junk,Bought this for my 4 year old son for Christmas. Waited until his cousins were over having a sleepover and broke it out thinking it would be something fun for them to do.It was broken.I put new batteries in it and it spun around once and died.I put new batteries thinking maybe it was the batteries. Nope. Still dead.Unfortunately I ordered it too early before Christmas and now the deadline to return it has come and gone so I need to just throw it away.Junk
2,Lasted less than a week,It was fun while it lasted! Unfortunately the wires must be really delicate. I wouldn't spend the money on it again.
2,On and off button works intermittently,"This is a fun toy when it works. Most of the time, however, the On button fails to operate, and that's very frustrating."
4,Almost excellent,"I think it is a very good toy for our 5 year old. The one year old can't quite get up in the air yet. Its not built the best, but designed to come apart if kids land on it. Worth the money. To get a fifth star I wish the fastest speed would have been a bit faster. My 5 year old gets a bit bored as even on the fastest speed its not much of a challenge."
5,The Discworld Mapp Review,"Very helpful and informative. Includes stories of famous discworld people. It helps to look at the map while you read the books to see where you are. And what ever happened to, ""You can't map a sense of Humor??"""
1,NO!,"The discworld should never have been mapped! Suddenly the live world of the Discworld has been projected onto and confined to two-dimensionality. Was this what we loved about Pratchett's geography? How can countries appear and disappear now? This map is not a gain, it's a loss!"
2,"Nope, sorry. Not for me.","It just didn't have the cachet of the books. Heaven knows, it tried, but it seem to lack that Pratchett touch."
4,A nice addition to your Pratchett collection.,"I bought The Discworld Mapp simply as an addition to my ever growing Discworld collection of books, and I am glad for the purchase. The Mapp itself could be removed from the cover - which is simply a carrier for the mapp and the accompanying 24 page booklet - and framed if so desired. I refer to the mapp during readings of various books, game play, or just out of curiousity.If you are a diehard Terry Pratchett fan you will probably be happy with a purchase of The Discworld Mapp; if you are a little too practical though, you might be able to do without it"
4,Putting it all together,I love this. The art work is great and it always helps to have a map to get the big picture. The map called Death's Domain is also very good.
3,"Good drawings, but not worth the price","First I must admit that I did enjoy the drawings in this ""booklet"". Paul Kidby did a great work, like anyone who saw his other works learns to expect. The reason I was disapointed is that for that price (more then $20) I expected much more content, and I expected to enjoy this book for much longer. For that price I can buy three books from the series."
4,"awesome book, but only if you can find a good price","This is a nice little book of mainly pencil drawn character illustrations. It's great if you're a hardcore Pratchett fan or studying chracter design. Sadly, it's a very thin book and usually sold at a high price. If you happen to get lucky and find it cheap get it, but otherwise stick with the more recent Pratchett/Kidby art book. It's cheaper, larger, has more colored pieces, and is in general more bang for your buck."
1,No idea,"The DVD is very close to the bible for a small part,especially Jesus' miracle signs that jesus didn't also like. I'm not a pharisee. There is no idea and messange of jesus."
1,Untold Life of Jesus,"This is the worst film of the life of Jesus. It tells nothing of the life of Jesus and is really one HD slideshow but in motion. When you turn on the movie all you see is someone doing something that you will have to know appears to be like what happened to Jesus. You need to know the story to follow the acting because it seems as if this story took place a few years ago. The actors are so bad that you even have to figure out that too. I think someone just made a home movie and went into business with High Tech DVD burning. I get better acting than this in junk mail DVDs. The only people that should get this movie is the actors, so they can say I did star in a movie in my life thanks to the life of Jesus. -99"
5,"Hilarious, Heatwarming and Relatable","Anyone would benefit from reading Nothing But the Truth (and a Few White Lies) by Justina Chen Headley. Books are not often written about people of biracial decent, leaving those who are biracial struggling to find someone they can relate to in literature, and many people who are not biracial ignorant to the struggle biracial people go through. When you read about someone like you... for some reason it's like a validation of your existence. For others who aren't biracial... maybe they will learn a little bit about what it means when you are. I loved all of the humor in the book, especially the mom lecture series'! I found myself laughing out loud frequently. But, while there is a lot of humor, there are also a lot of touching, tear-jerking moments. You'll laugh, you'll cry... what are you waiting for?"
3,Uncle Tom can't dance,"The movie was a good one, but Uncle Tom can't dance worth sh*t. If you wanna see some cool black dudes dance just go watch ""Tap"" those guys can dance. Plus, Tom gets crucified at the end and then burnt at the stake. Uncle tom is a sucker! haha"
2,The silent movie was much better,The book by H.B.S. was not intended to be about heroism or love but about the inhumanity of slavery. The author breathed life into the characters primarily to evoke sympathy for them from the reader or hatred for them in the case of Simon Legree. I saw this black and white silent movie for the first time at the age of 13. Up until that time I had only occasional contact with black people and did not understand why they were so radical about the topic of slavery. My only understanding of slavery was the Shirley Temple version and I thought black people were being overly sensitive about it. Seeing Uncle Tom's Cabin was like an awakening that changed my understand of the whole relationship between black people and slavery. The silent movie was much better at bringing across the true purpose of the novel without the hollywood slant of modern versions.
5,I LOVE THE MOVIE .,THE MOVIE IS AN INTRIGUING STORY OF HOW SLAVERY USED TO BE AND HOW ONE MAN TIED TO OVERCOME HIS EVIL MASTER'S WAYS. EVERYONE POTRAYED VERY EXCITING CHARACTERS. I ESPECIALLY LIKED EDWARD WOODWARD'S POTRAYAL OF THE EVIL SIMON LEGREE
3,uncle toms cabin,I thought it would have more like the book. It changed alot of small details that added more meaning to the story.
2,Uncle Tom Video,The movie does not lend itself well to the text; it is flat and does no justice to the literary piece. The quality was mediocre.
3,A good adaptation,I thought Uncle Tom's Cabin was a very good adaptation of the book. It followed the storyline as close as possible. Some parts of the book were left out though. Most noticeably is the crossing of the river by Eliza. This scene has been replaced by her merely floating across on a raft.I think this movie was very well cast. The actors looked and performed as I pictured them while reading the book. The acting was decent but not spectacular. Not surprisingly the best actor was definitely Samuel L. Jackson.The sets were nicely done. Simon Legree's plantation had a run down feel which matched the attitude of the place. Similarly the St.Clare's was a beautifully done place with flowers and Victorian furniture.Out of all the Uncle Tom's Cabin adaptations that I have seen this is by far the best. As a movie this is a little above average but as a movie based on a book it is very good.
4,Delicate and pretty,"These earrings are delicate, pretty and easy to wear. The mother-of-pearl and the lapis are inlaid and flush with the silver, which is not easy to see in the picture. The color of the lapis is a royal blue."
5,Best Body Wash Ever,"I am total ""bath person"" and this the by far the Best Body Wash ever. It has a clean crisp smell and leaves your skin soft and smooth."
1,Just a bunch of chemicals called lotion,This product is loaded with harmful chemicals and frankly I wouldn't want to wear all that garbage on my body! Thank goodness for WendyLou's Natural Bath. All vegetable based bath and body products. Her goats milk lotion is wonderful and so moisturizing. I also love her homemade goats milk soaps. No animal testing either.
4,Genealogist's Handbook,For those of us researching our heritage one of the most helpful books was written by Virginia Lee Hutcheson Davis. Check to see if your ancestor is listed in her books & if so add it to your reference collection. These books are especially good if you are researching your line for information to enterhistorical organizations.
5,Joining the SAS - Barry Davies,The must have companion to those seriously considering a career in the SAS or other special forces. This book will provide you with an insiders view of the essentials required to pass the ultimate pysical and mental test -The SAS selection course.
3,You Have to Like Gedda,"This was one of the first opera recordings I had ever bought, way back when LPs were still on vinyl. Yes, Beverly Sills is wonderful and I've always loved her recordings. Hoever, I have never been a fan of Gedda and this recording did nothing to win me over. He was even worse in her recording of Thais. If you like Gedda, then this is a great recording for you. If not, then its a toss up with other recordings of this opera."
5,Sills at her best,"I have owned this opera on vinyl for years..(1972) and this is one of Beverly Sills's ultimate roles as far as I am concerned...Lucia and Manon being the other two.As any opera afficienado knows there are three different vocal techniques..Act I with its coloratura fireworks,ActII a more dramatic soprano technique and ActIII more lyrical ...Sills empathizes with the character of Violetta...her giddiness in the begining of the opera to the pathos of a dying,fallen woman in Act III.This is the ULTIMATE Traviata...I am familiar with the Sutherland and Callas versions but in my estimation...it is Sills,Sills and Sills ....Sutherland may have more techinique but her version is boring...Callas has the acting ability but not the voice..."
5,Great Series of Recipies,"My wife saw a recommendation for this book, so we bought it. She has read it through and thorougly ejoyed it, since it provides more sourdough recipes in one place, than elsewhere. It's a 1982 book, so costs more than its original cover price to find in decent shape (ours was purchased ""used"" but in great shape). It is written by an outdoorsman, based on many recepes he's gathered and tried or experienced in years of travel. We look forward to trying many of the recepies that appear easy to make."
2,find something else,I received this as a wedding gift and from day one it hasn't worked very well. We always have to microwave everything we cook after we use the toaster oven because its not quite done. I also have tried to cook waffles ... it burned one side while making the other side soggy. Either spend more money on something that actually works or just stick with your regular toaster and microwave.
2,"Best looking, Worse Performing","This toaster looked the best and had the price and brand name that I expect at Target. Unfortunately, the performance was poor as nothing toasted evenly. And the toaster ticked down the time like an old kitchen timer."
1,The worst toaster oven ever,"I have owned Black & Decker toast ovens in the past and been happy with them, but this toaster oven is an evil toast burner. It 1) clicks annoyingly, 2) can't be turned off halfway through the toaster cycle if you think your toast is already done, and 3) ALWAYS burns the bottom of your toast and leaves your toast top raw. This is in part because 4) there is only one heating element on the top and on the bottom, instead of the two strips the old toaster ovens had. The bake function also burns things.DON'T BUY THIS TOASTER OVEN!"
2,"Looks great, burns toast.","Toaster ovens have never been known for their toast, but this is ridiculous. I can only advise using the broil setting because otherwise the bottom of your toast is burnt before the top is done. Oh yeah, the other bonus prize if you use the toast setting is...if you look at it and it's done, you can't just turn the knob and shut the thing off (although I didn't FORCE it)...you can either wait it out or remove your toast as the machine continues to toast nothing.On the other hand, it works quite nicely for tasks in which you use the little pan. Frozen pizza and other convenience foods do well here, and the temperature seems fairly true to the stated settings (of which there are few.) Great if you don't want to heat the ""real oven"" for a few pieces of garlic bread."
1,Piece of Trash - Save your old toaster,"Only toasts/browns a two inch strip. There is only one element in the middle of the top and one in the middle of the bottom. I too got it because it looked nice. It still looks nice, while we had to pull out our old stuff to actually have toast."
1,PIECE OF TRASH,"The first time I used it, no problem. The second time I used it SMOKE came out from it setting off the fire alarm in the kitchen. People keep telling me that maybr crumbs got in the bottom of it but at the rate the smoke was pouring out, I seriously doubt it.DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE."
4,whoa there with the negative reviews,"Received this as a wedding gift. Registered for it because it looked cooler than the other ones in the store, and was bigger than the ancient one I'd inherited from the great, great aunt. It does a fine job of toasting, but it is lacking something I (mistakenly) thought all toaster ovens included: the little tray that sits on the rack and catches the cheese that spills over the edge of my grilled american. Still, though, not bad at all."
2,More BattleTech than Bolo. Shame!,"A friend of mine who was ""into sci-fi"" convinced me to read a ""BattleTech"" book. Cheap fireworks for understimulated teenagers; a complete waste of time. But long before this pulp a master of the Golden Age wrote the best-ever stories of this genre', the Bolo stories. Keith Laumer's Bolo wasn't just big guns incidentally slaved to a good computer. It felt pain; passion; dismay; hope; joy; and above all else desire. It spoke with cold logic, never wasted a word. But its nanosecond thoughts were lavish with emotion. As with tales of soft-spoken heroes of the martial arts or the Old West, they think much and speak little -- and only then carry a big stick. Honor and desire, not mere power, are the Bolo's allegories. The authors of ""Unconquerable"" have insipidly shifted the focus from guts to guns. Laumer's passion and vision extinguished in these stories, they might as well carry the ""Power Rangers"" brand name -- it would be just as relevant, and more apropos."
3,"Some good info, but not as much as some other guides","This book has some nice in-depth info on certain herbs for beginning herbalists. It doesn't go into enough detail on how to make medicines from the herbs or give as many types of herbs as several other herb books, which would be more useful for the more advanced herbalist."
4,The best hose kit,We've had the original Rhinoflex 15 foot hose kit for four years now. It works great. Just now noticed a pin hole leak in the hose. Also ound out that it could have been done by birds. It seems they try to get through to a water source. Now in the market for another Rhinoflex but noticed some people are having problems with the new fittings fitting inside of their 4 inch square bumper. Will investigate this more.What we've always liked about the Rhinoflex is that it is so rigid. You only need to expand as much hose as is needed to hook up and it holds it's shape well. It's not at all like the flimsy limp hoses others make.
5,Rhino- flex sewer hose for RV,"Simply the best hose you can get for your RV, read the specs and feel it at a RV parts store."
1,Poor design?,I borrowed a RV with this system included. I've had nothing but trouble with it. Fittings don't go on as claimed and it takes 2 of us to dump tanks - one on each end to keep fittings to hose. Several near disasters. I would never buy this product or recommend it.
3,Smaller then the Autozone 3D Skull plate,"Its nice, but smaller then then the ones you see at Autozone, Got it cause was cheaper, but the head is one size smaller.."
2,INTELLIGENCE CRISIS,"CRISIS is one of those in your face martial arts movies that suspends logic and credibility. An ecological group led by saintly Brad Milne enlists his brother, a secret mob hitman, to help in his cause. However, one of the members of the group has a different agenda, and we end up with the eco group being the villains.David Bradley, long known ? for his kung fu movies, is lifeless, and actionless. The movie has no real exciting fight scenes and the ending is unabashedly predictable.Fans of Bradley may like; all others think twice."
5,Good Sandable Primer in a Can,"PROS-Sandable-Cap never clogged-Dried very very fast-Even white color-Rust resistant-Smooth consistency (no chunks)-Hard to make the paint drip (unless you're too close)CONS-A bit expensive.-When I bought them, they came with a standard ""fat cap,"" that was not as responsive as I would like, but now they seem to have a more high-tech cap, so I don't know."
2,not the same Foreign Legion,"this is NOT the hiphop group Foreign Legion and has absolutely nothing to do with hiphop. Its a generic Australian indie/punk band. the fact amazon has this listed under hiphop as well as alternative is misleading because alot of independant hiphop is listed on here in the same categories as well (Grouch, Eligh, etc). No Prozack Turner here. I hate when someone gives a album a bad rating just because its not what they wanted so I gave this a shot anyway...and it is a bad album. I'll give it 2 stars instead of one because its not completely horrible. be sure to check out Playtight and Kindapper Van by the better Foreign Legion and avoid this"
1,No,"I'm sorry but this album was just awful!! It was so cheesy. I couldn't stand listening to it for more than 15 minutes. It's obnoxious. I hear local Dj's playing the same songs. Infact, i heard the same songs at Chucky Cheese's."
5,"Weddings, Christenings & Anniversaries in Lace by Bridget M.","Another great book by Bridget Cook. As usual, easy to follow international colour coding system is used but you need to be familiar with the basic stitches before embarking on any of the patterns. Suitable for lacemakers of all levels. Simple and lovely patterns makes great gifts too."
4,Finally a professional view on the high-yield bond market,"Finally a book written by someone who understands capital markets as opposed to journalists-turned-financial experts (e.g., ""Predators Ball""), catering to popular sentiment (it's book sales, stupid!) and demonstrating astonishing financial naivity. Professor Fischel's account of Milken's financial innovation may never score big with general public, but it is a must-read for all finance practitioners and, hopefully, government officials, including NYC mayor."
1,Item is NOT Johnson & Johnson as advertised and Pictured in Ad,The item pictured and advertised as a genuine Johnson & Johnson product was not a JNJ product.Amazon should not advertise it as Johnson & Johnson.The original product was superior to the product that is being sent to customers who answer the Johnson & Johnson ad.
5,Helps Fight Gum Disease,These little beauties help to remove plaque better than floss. You moisten the tips and insert the pointed end between teeth with the flat side next to the gums. You use a gentle-in-and-out motion to clean between the teeth.My dad got me using these as he loves them and I have to agree. I just found the mint flavored ones and now prefer the mint to the regular flavor. Toothpicks will annoy you after you use these stim-u-dents.~The Rebecca Review
3,A Dentist Reviews This Product,"This product by J&J; is esentially a tapered toothpick designed to fit better in-between the teeth than a regular toothpick. It does a fair job of cleaning out food debris and plaque from between the teeth but does not replace flossing as it cannot clean the bacterial film between the contact points of the teeth. It is the contact points where many people get cavities.The greatest advantage of this method of tooth cleaning is that it is easy to do and it is portable. You can use this product virtually anywhere and it fits in a shirt pocket.I recommend this product to those folks who like to have a toothpick handy. It does work, but don't thow away your floss!Jim ""Konedog"" Koenig, DDS"
3,Substitute Stimudents,"I specifically ordered these STIMUDENTS because they were advertised as the ""Johnson and Johnson"" product, but when I received them they were a product made in China by ""Revive Personal Products"". I'd used this brand before and they tended to break, split, or get soggy. THe exterior packaging and wording are almost identical to the J&J packaging, so they LOOK like the real Stimudents."
5,Delay High costs of teeth cleaning!,I am 51 years old. I have been using these for years I cannot remember when I first started. Last year I went in for a checkup and had my teeth cleaned for the first time in close to 30 years. I asked the dental assistant who cleaned my teeth how long ago she thought that they were last cleaned and she said about a year and a half. When I told her when I had it done last she was amazed. I use these every morning and evening and during the day as a toothpick replacement. They are gentle to the gums.
1,"Don't buy -- interesting film, unacceptable transfer","I have known this film for a long time. The intensity and artistry of the eroticism is well worth watching, for those so inclined. Based on the film content itself, it would be **** or *****.But.... rent rather than buy if you can, this is a BAD transfer, the worst video quality I have ever seen on any DVD. I tried it with two players, with identical results, and I had to try another known-good DVD to make sure my equipment had not gone on the blink. I am not sure how they could have got it so wrong -- either it is a transfer from bad tape, or a bad job of conversion from PAL format. It looks like the interlacing is backwards. I am not sure if previous DVD and VHS editions are as bad as this current one. This product is an exploitive rip-off, and I would certainly not have bought it if I had known the quality would be so bad."
2,about this DVDfilm/movie Tokyo Decadence,"I share the purchase of this film with my friend David S Caleb and after viewing this piece of DVD, what I found is something that catch the eyes of male big is the one scene near to almost the end where the woman use a whip to whip the man and the man is forced to drink her pee from a metal tub. that's all.....This film looks very normal which is to say that it is almost like any other erotic title of DVD that show the erotic styke in films like shaking of backside where the woman is wearing sex atraction gear etc.Review by:Dr, MR Franc MBBS (PhD) GPS Ang Poon Kahmode 2 first generation government people of SingaporeAssistant FED Chief (Internationale)Director 'lou ye'-Ang Poon Kah for film summer palace."
5,Always a favorite,"I bought this when it first came out and has been a favorite ever since. No other album puts me in the right spirit of Christmas in celebration of the Savior than this one. The soft songs are sweet and the Quiet Night in Bethlehem is anything but quiet. The producers of this album obviously put great effort in keeping Wayne's voice true. I have many many Christmas albums, but this is always my go to album."
4,Worth a Place in the Holiday Collection,"I've had this album in my collection for a few years now. I pull it out every Christmas and listen to it a few times.I find the recording a pleasant mix of traditional songs and originals. The Angels Medley is fun and a nice turn on the traditional arrangements. The remainder of the traditional songs have a contemporary feel to them. The work is tasteful without sounding either too upbeat or too much like existing arrangements.While not extraordinary, Wayne Watson has a pleasant voice that wears easy on the ears. He executes well. I have no reservations about his musicianship.If you like Wayne Watson and are looking for holiday music that is not what you'll hear in the shops and on the radio during the season, this is not a bad buy. You could do far worse."
2,Absolutely dreadful; gives chick lit a bad name,"I made the mistake of picking this up because it was recommended to those who love the Shopaholic series. Let me be clear, Tiffany Trott is in no way on par with the loveable and hilarious Shopaholic. All British gals are not created equal. Tiffany's narrative was extremely tedious and in no way entertaining. She's whiny and obsessed with finding a long-term boyfriend. The flirting in the book was lame, overdone, and none of the characters managed to endear themselves to me. I'm sorry I wasted my time on this book."
2,The Trials of a Frustrated Reader,"Well, what do I say? The book started out, and I genuinely laughed out loud a few times. Tiffany and her motley assortment of friends had some funny observations on life, and I enjoyed bits of the snarky humor. I did find Tiffany a bit self absorbed and hard to like, but figured she would redeem herself part way through the book. I mean, everyone has to grow up, right? But the truth is, by half way through, I not only found that I didn't like or empathize with her, but that she was a bit of an idiot. I couldn't see why her friends liked her, since everything seemed to be about her. She never did grow up. So, for over 400 pages, I was reading about someone who had the emotional maturity of a 4 year old, AND SHE NEVER CHANGED. Then, the ending came. And it wasn't an ending. So, for over 400 pages, I went along thinking at least the ending will give some closure, but it didn't. I am really disappointed. This book started out with such promise."
2,Boring and Predictable,"I've been seduced by the ""chick lit"" genre, but this book is hardly worth reading. While there are a few funny moments, I found myself skimming over the many boring parts. And while the ending isn't predictable, I still found it rather corny."
3,"It started wonderful, slowing to the end.","I really enjoyed the first 2/3 of the book. It was very lighthearted, and enjoyable, however, I was quite dissapointed with the end."
3,Forgettable,"I don't get the good reviews on this one. I forgot it almost immediately after I finished it. True, there are some funny parts, and it was a decent way to pass the time sitting in airports, but most of the humor was the typical British stuff and the main character failed to gain my sympathy even til the end. Recommended only if a) you're hooked on this stuff so even the not-so-good is okay or b) you've read all the current chick-lits including both Shopaholics and there's nothing else for you to cover?"
3,hard to keep up with,"Tiffany Trott is celebrating her birthday and possibly an engagement, or so she thinks, until her boyfriend dumps her.From here on in, Tiffany is on a mission - to find Mr Right before she becomes wrinkly and decrepid. There are blind dates, personal ads, old school friends, singles dinners, agencies and holidays to be tried and tested to sniff out the right bloke.Although this story does have some quite funny scenes, it was not terribly interesting for me. Every time I picked the book back up, I had to try and figure which man she was talking about. Unfortunately it was a case of too many men with forgettable inadequacies.I also tired of the naive nature of the main character, Tiffany. I had had enough of the ""Actually I didn't say that, I really said..."" scenario. I did finish the book, but I don't feel compelled to try more from this author."
2,The Trials of Tiffany Trott,"I recently, just finished reading this book. At first it seemed like a good book to read. But in the end, I was very disappointed. I thought it was going to better."
4,No Comparison to Bridget Jones,"Tiffany Trott is funny and entertaining, but is no comparison to Bridget Jones. While Bridget is funnier and more entertaining, Tiffany is a tad desperate and annoying. However, if you enjoy this genre of dating problem / funny novels, you will enjoy this one too. The ending,though, was extremely disappointing. It made me wonder why I read the book. Take it to the beach, breeze through it, then read Bridget Jones's sequel- On the Edge of Reason."
2,Not Bridget Jones,"I recently read a review that claimed that The Trials of Tiffany Trott was excellent, ""better than Bridget Jones."" I am an avid reader and just could not bear to even pick up the book. I could not even finish the last ten pages. I do not recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fun, lighthearted comedies, because this book is not one of them."
2,Very Disappointed!,"... I decided to give Tiffany a try. Well, she's no Bridget Jones. The characters are cliches. The plot (such as there is) offers few surprises. And as an American, I just didn't get some of the humor. But most of the book is so unamusing, I'm sure many Brits don't get it either. In short, save your money and re-read Bridget Jones instead."
5,Very witty and also human,"A friend lent me this last weekend and I read it in a day - couldn't be parted from it, kept having to sneak back to it to find out how Tiffany's latest date had gone. I was really taken aback by how funny this book is - the writing and jokes are very clever, and I laughed out loud a lot - especially when she went o the Bahamas Club Med. As the book went on it got deeper, especially with the way Tiffany becomes her friend's birth partner - the baby classes were just a hoot and the birth of the baby made me blub! I really liked the way Tiffany is so polite and self-controlled whilst thinking quite vicious things which she keeps to herself. I thought that was very true to life. The characters and situations were so vivid and dramatic that it was like watching a movie - the dialog was so smart and lively. In short, a gripping, intelligent comedy of manners with a lot of feeling too."
4,A Delightful Read!,"The Trials of Tiffany Trott is a wonderfully funny book! It was a quick read... partly due to the fact that I just didn't want to put it down. Who did she meet for a date next? What incredible thing was going to happen to her on that date?While I don't know anyone who goes out on as many dates as Tiffany did, Isabel Wolff's description was an accurate description of women dating today. For those of us still searching for, ""Mr. Right"" it will seem only too real! For those of you that have already found your ""Mr. Right"" you will be thanking your lucky stars as you read of Tiffany's adventures. Either way, it's a delightful read!"
4,Loved it.,"This book is along the same format as a lot of books lately seem to be. I all it Bridget-Jonesesque. Not to say that it's a clone of Bridget Jones, but it's the single woman in London looking for a man and success in life, etc.Having said that, I did truly enjoy it. Tiffany finds herself in some very bizaare situations (which is something that I always enjoy in a novel!) and the cast of characters includes some of her friends, who find themselves in equally bizaare situations. (All I'm going to say about that is that the male-bonding retreat chapter is hilarious!)"
4,A delight for single ladies -- and just about anyone else,"As an unpartnered lady, I think this book was EXCELLENT -- funny, sad and true-to-life. And I just LOVED the ""thoughts"" -- the ""I-didn't-actually-say-that"" lines! I thought they were GREAT! No, this ISN'T Bridget Jones, it's different (I liked BJ too, but I don't really get all the parallels. They're two different characters, two different books, by two different authors).As a romantic with a Valentine where her heart ought to be, I didn't care too much for the ending, which is why 4 stars instead of 5, but on the whole, this is a wonderful read for unpartnered ladies -- and just about anyone else!"
2,Not quite Bridget Jones,"I am currently on a huge English Humor kick that started when I read Bridget Jones... This was Ok to read but not exactly a thrill. If I wasn't on vacation without other books I probably wouldn't have finished it. I didn't really care what happened to Tiffany, didn't really care who she dated, found her a little boring. The only part I really liked was her pregnant friend."
2,the trial that never ended......,"for me, i found this book to drag on and on......it finally made me 'laugh out loud' on page 280 with the description of childbirth which, for some reason, struck me to be hilarious, having gone through it three times myself. the rest of the book was fun, but too bad it took 280 pages to get there.the author described too much in detail, leaving not much to the imagination. when she said things she retorted with ""i didn't really say that"", this got annoying after the eleventh time. she also went on and on with giving examples, endlessly.anyway, all-in-all, i am glad the trial is finally over. the end was predictable, even though she left us with quite an uncertainty......on to a more funny novel.....i hope."
2,The trials of reading Tiffany Trott,"Tiffany Trott is not a likeable character. She whines too much about the most trivial things and the funny moments throughout the book are sparse. It's repetitive, with no storyline and you loose interest in her ordeals a quarter into the book.. I can see why she's single...she's utterly annoying. I wouldn't want to date her. TT spends the entire book pining for ""super successful"", who is never fleshed out, really, and when he finally is available, she doesn't want to be get married--her main objective of the entire book. She will probably be wondering, ten years from now why she didn't marry him, like she did with Kit--then the sequel will follow: ""The dilemma of Tiffany Trott: still single at 47!""Reading all the glowing reviews claiming TT is better than Bridget Jones Diary, I wondered how they could have read the same book I did. The Trials of Tiffany Trott is a ""skip it""."
2,Not terribly funny - last page provided the punch line,Didn't think it was a terribly good book. Bit boring and not terribly funny. The ending was good but what a pity that it was really only the last page.
2,Not pleased,"I read Wolff's other book (the making of minty malone) before this one, and was very disappointed when I read this one. I felt attached to the title character, but felt she was in a lose lose situation that did not resolve by the end of the book. My suggestion...read Minty Malone...you find out what happened to Tiffany anyway."
4,"Nice, romantic read!","A very funny book that most women can relate to. Tiffany is funny, witty, tempermental, and is definitely afraid of commitment! I couldn't put the book down until I read it all. Nice ending!"
3,Mainly Read It For Some Laughs,"I will say that this novel can be funny. However, a book length riff on a 37 year old career woman's endless dates wears thin after awhile. Dismayed that all of her friends are marrying, TT dates just about every nightmare guy you can imagine, some courtesy of dating bureaus and personals' ads. These encounters can be really hilarious. The best guy of the bunch is married and looking for an affair, claiming he can't get a divorce. One annoying thing that TT does throughout is give stinging, witty comebacks to other characters and then tell you, in the next breath, she didn't have the nerve to say that after all. She only wished she could say it. If this was meant to be a comic device, it didn't work for me. Romance readers may not be happy with the ending, which is ambiguous instead of definitive with Mr. Right. An ambiguous ending was ok with me because I was never convinced TT really knew what she wanted in a man or a marriage. She seemed suited to being single."
5,"Funny, Funny, Funny!","This book had me in stitches. Successful, independent, lovable, thirty-eight year old Tiffany has it all except for a man in her life. Oh, there've been boyfriends but they have been a hopeless cast of oddballs. The harder Tiffany tries to land herself a man, the worse off she seems to be. But she perseveres in her search and is thoroughly entertaining to the reader all the way. And even when we see her to the end of her journey, she still manages to throw in a little twist for a somewhat surprise ending. This is a thoroughly entertaining book and I won't hesitate to read more by Isabel Wolff."
3,A good read..,"'Tiffany Trott' tries hard to be as good as Bridget Jones but she doesn't quite make it. However, it was still a good read and I will try Isabel Wolff's other novels. What can I say...I've read all of Helen Fielding's novels and I still can't get enough British Chick-lit. I'm hooked!!!!"
3,OK,"I thought this book was definitely a witty read. One of those books you can devour quickly. The characters were great, but the book was a bit unfulfilling at the end."
2,Exhausting,"By the end of this book, I was thoroughly exhausted with Tiffany Trott. It looked like a fun read, but it took too much effort for it to actually be called ""fun."" It was more like work reading about the extreme minutae of Tiffany's dating life and quest for Mr. Right, or Mr. All Right. I'm not even sure she was such a great catch herself - she wasn't funny, or very sweet, or endearing in any way. If I were Tiffany, I'd be exhausted with myself. It was just too many darn pages to sift through to find out that Tiffany is happier being single."
4,Comic Realism!,"I saw the other reviews for this book and am appalled at how many people didn't like it! I thought this was a wonderfully funny book. Though, I must say, Seriously Successful was a bit on the strange side....otherwise I think if you like contemporary romance then this is my pick for you!"
3,A pleasant surprise,"This book was bought on a lark and turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Although I could see how some readers would find the heroine annoying after a while, this was a light, enjoyable reading experience."
4,i loved this book...,"this is definitely one of the best brit-chick-lit books i've tried so far,and i've tried a lot... it's definitely a witty, clever read, it also has some notable characters, a good deal of warmth and an interesting ending (which maybe not everyone will like). but overall a lovely way to spend two or three afternoons and definitely one to add to your vacation reading."
4,"Fluff, but FUN Fluff!","I really loved this book. It came to me by way of a friend of a friend and I just howled all the way though. I really didn't think I'd like all the British Dating/Comedy/woe-is-me books as much as I do, but boy, do I! Tiffany is a great gal caught in the crappy world of dating. Even I, a Happily Married Woman could appreciate her tales. After all, we've ALL been there. Well, hopefully not as badly as poor Tiff has."
1,Tiffany Trite?,"This book should really be called the TRIALS OF TIFFANY TRITE. It is one of the dullest books of this genre I have tried to read...though in fact...I gave up halfway through. It is peat and repeat through-out as this silly, unfunny girl stumbles over pebbles on the path of love."
2,review,"I didn't particularly care for the story in this book. I did enjoy the manner in which it was written, however. A very quick read."
2,"Good, but definitely put-downable","I am currently in the middle of a Brit-Chick-Lit phase and this was the 10th or 11th book I read from that catergory. Although the book was entertaining, if not very funny in parts, I thought it to be near the bottom of the list so far. I would find myself suddenly remembering that I hadn't read it in a few days, and that is very unlike me as I usually finish a book I am enjoying in a day or 2.Conclusion: Not a terrible read on a rainy day"
1,the trial of reading this one,"I like to mix up my reading from those depressing ""Oprah-type"" recommendations with light-comedy focused titles. From some of the descriptions and reviews, this book SEEMED to be a perfect fit for a comic relief. What a disappointment. I cannot think of any redeaming quality of any of the characters. Fool that I am, I stuck with it, hoping that it would get funny somewhere in those pages. I should have known better as this ""light read"" took me about 2 weeks to finish. This is going in my ""to be donated"" pile and I pitty the poor soul who pays a buck for this worthless book."
2,A poorwoman's Bridget Jones,About half as good as the Bridget Jones books. It is a quick knock-off that I didn't find half as funny. I would not recommend.
2,"A decent beginning, but there are far more enticing reads...","....a light novel, full of rather predictable yet vaguely compelling scenerios and characters. Isabel Wolff is a very popular author, and one does appreciate the occasioanl Book Lite -- but a far funnier and better book is Otherwise Engaged, by Suzanne Finnamore -- or Bridget Jones by Helen Fielding, or Girls Guide To Hunting and Fishing by Melissa Banks. They are more thoughtful and original, sophisticated yet truth-bearing -- and overall more enlightening on the state of the singlehood.I think if you don't come away with a satisfied feeling from your ten dollars, it just isn't that good and could easily be borrowed at the library. Great is the enemy of Good, I suppose....thus the popularity of Jane Austen, still!!"
1,What has happened to my favorite series.,"I don't like Christina's character she is a brat. The books are all about Sterling's three-day event problems. The series used to be about racing. Also, Whitebrook used to be all nice people but lately even the character of Ashleigh is a jerk. The only good part of THOROUGHBRED books lately is the prankster Melanie, hopefully she stays at Whitebrook for awhile."
1,this sucks!,"OK, Joanna Campbell NEEDS to come back. I just re-read all the books Joanna wrote, and they are soooo good...I hate how the new authors are making it a jumping series! And Christina is a little brat, I would hate to be around her. I loved the TB series when it was about racing, not about weather or not Sterling can go over a stupid water jump (hasnt she had that problem for 3 or 4 books now?)"
1,Where is Thoroughbred?,"Gosh, I didn't read this series to hear about abunch of brats going to riding school and stuff. This was a series on horse racing and from #25 and so it's a continuation or The christmas Special! I don't like it much anymore!"
1,How low can this series get???????,"These books are just plain BAD. Sterling LOVED dressage in #26, hated it in #27, Now she loves it again . In this book, Sterling was eager to jump. I thought she couldn't get over a 2 foot vertical??! I LOVE TO JUMP, but Christina is obsessed. It's all she thinks about. She doesn't remember how to have fun on a horse. She also thinks everybody else has to be as serious about riding as she is. What if Dylan was as serious about soccar as she is about riding?? Would she even care????? My advice to the authers: Bring Sammy back and drop Christina and only do books about Melanie and racing!!!!!!!!"
1,I refuse to read it,"The next book is called A Home for Melanie. I guess that's when racing starts again. I'll read that. But if it's like all the others I'm dropping the series. I am NOT going to read about wonderful super horses. If I have to read through clones of Glory's Rival then that's it. This book is the absolute worst the series can get. At least I think so. This series is total crap. I don't think I'll ever go back. If I won't read about super horses then I will not read about pointless ""Oh I think horses are for little kids"" crap. Thank you."
2,What Happened to Horses,I Love thoroughbred I love Sammy and Ashliegh! Cindy is O.K But well this New Generation is well.........um....... How should I put this? For one thing they are 12&13 and they are already dateing. This book is not Realy about horses it is about Dylan and Christina and how Dylan wants a motor bike Pul--lease!!!! use to I would whate excidetly for the net TB book to come out and now well what can I say They have gotten better and in to racing! But this one UGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,What happened to Sammy and Cindy??,"I have nothing against eventing, but if I wanted to read about it, i would read Saddle Club. I miss the books with Ashleigh and Sammy. I know Ashleigh is still in these books, but it doesn't seem like her. And Sammy went to Ireland? Why would she do that? and Cindy dissapeared! plus, i thought that these books were about horses, not boys and dating! Ashleigh, Sammy and Cindy cared more about horses than dating. Please, come back Joanna! And what happened to all those other horses? Champion, Glory, Honor Bright, Townsend Princess?"
2,a buch of bull on Christina's part,"I liked this book but, what the heck happened to Cindy and Max and every one else??? Sure i like jumping but i like reading Joanna's descriptions of the racing industry. This writer, Alison Estes, she needs to actually read the past Thoroughbred books before she continues writing them!! I'm sick of hearing about how cute Dylan is and Sterling's major problems! Christina isn't even realistic about owning Sterling! I mean, she's had the horse for like three months and she expects her to be a perfect event horse!? what i bunch of bull! i ride a horse who is 8 and has been of the track since he was 5 and he still dosn't have every thing down! Christina needs to come down to earth and not expect so much of Sterling. All i have to say is JOANNA! COME BACK!!!!!!"
1,Now how many books have had this pointless plot?,"I'm sorry but I just don't see how this book fits into the series. I mean, think about it-a series called Thoroughbred. Wouldn't you think it was about horses, riding, and horse care instead of two brats trying to keep their friendship? Ha!TB is not the Babysitters Club or something. I doubt that I'm going to buy this book-maybe read it just to see how pointles it is & to keep up with the series. I know that since book #28 the series has been getting better-but THIS? Sounds like a joke to me!"
3,I agree with 1st review,These books are great uf you know absoulty nothin about horses i mean 3 months off the track and allready 3ft fences! please! I think that the lady who wrote this book knew nothin about training an event horse- hey im not saying i kno every thin but i am training a little filly to event and i have to say that in 3 years we are where Christina is in 3 months!!! Alos where the heck did Max go and why? Max and Cindy were perfect together! all around pathetic! I wish that Joanna would come back as well! Atleast she wrote the books and knows what had happened before!
1,uhhhhh Joanna???????,"Ok Joanna since you are back to writing the books can you start back to racing??? PLEASE!!!!! and bring cindy,sammy,Glory,and all of wonders kids back and the old group. I want to be a jockey when i turn 16yrs old and your books have helped me sooooooooooooooooooo much with learning how to ride a racehorse. Oh i think somehow you should get Wonder's Legicy back. i hope ya start writing about racing again! your the best!!!! oh is there an address we can write U???????????????? ~K"
3,HELLOOOO????,"I have all the books of the TB seris up to 31. But I have a few questions.....WHERE DID CINDY GO??? HELLO????? SHE VANISHED AFTER THE HORSE OF HER DREAMS!! I like Christina, but lately I'm tired about hearing about liking Dylan, and Sterling's problems, so BRING BACK RACING!!!!! And also, how can Mel be Chris's cuz?? Ashleigh had one sis, Caro, and one bro, Rory. Mel's dad is Will, and I don't think Caro died!!! Mike didn't have any bro's or sis's, I think. I have two of the Ashleigh editions, and all of the Super and Anneversary editions, so email me if you want to chat, or you have the answer to my question. Joanna, COME BACK!"
