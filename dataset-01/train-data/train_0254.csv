4,Cadence Jazz magazine review:,"Cadence, Shapes""DeChellis is both introspective and experimental....Just as a good actor might make one forget one is watching an actor play a role instead of looking in on the characters life, so can DeChellis make the listener forget he/she is listening to someone play music, rather than just listening to the music itself...It's DeChellis' complete consonance with the music that makes it sound so organic and uncontrived...DeChellis' choices were perfect, even when they involved plucking the strings or gently striking them with a mallet, that they didn't seem like choices at all."" - Eric Saidel"
1,Rosalind Gardner is a crook,"I was attracted by: ""How I made 437K "" expecting a fiduciary account of how she did it. I did allow expectactions that she was underage single parent with 1000 kids, has aids and without a job The author spend 99.9% of the pages on information that is not related to ""how she made 437K"". As a good Jhon I dont want my money back. I hope some one can call the IRS and report that Rosalind Gardner made $437,797...(my revenge)"
1,Nul,"Ce livre est absolument nul : lieux communs, banalités, enfoncement de portes déjà ouvertes, glorification de l'auteur.Peut éventuellement convenir à un affilié débutant.Pour les affilieurs, rien d'intéressant à lire"
4,this is a great book -- especially if you put into action all of Rosalind's advice,"This book is very well written and as a newbie to affiliate marketing I found it easy and pleasant to read.Rosalind is definately a successful affiliate so that was a plus.What I found most useful is her advocation of keyword analysis BEFORE embarking on a particular niche as well as the use of marketing metrics to regularly measure what campaigns are working (and those that are not, of course).Buying this book will not make you a super affiliate -- but if you use it and take Rosalind's advice -- with the realistic expectation that it will take some work and time, then this is your book.Afterall, Rosalind has been doing this stuff since 1998...you've got to stick with it for it to pay off!lisa wilsonwww.ebook-utopia.com"
3,Purchase this a lot cheaper!,"I got this book and ""Make a Fortune Promoting Other People's Stuff Online: How Affiliate Marketing Can Make You Rich"" from my local library. They are the same book with different titles! Save yourself a lot of money and buy ""Make a Fortune Promoting Other People's Stuff Online: How Affiliate Marketing Can Make You Rich"".I do like these books because they have a lot of useful information but two books with the same information? That is not right. Why is one $15 and the other $50?!Buy ""Make a Fortune Promoting Other People's Stuff Online: How Affiliate Marketing Can Make You Rich"" instead."
2,Save Your Money,"I have followed Rosalind on YouTube for a while now, and believe she does offer good information and seems to be a very nice woman.However, this book is poorly written, the information is vague and the book itself is entirely too expensive. It's an insult to this woman's intelligence. I was thoroughly disappointed.Do yourself a favor and pick up Problogger instead, then find the rest of the info for free on the internet."
2,Overall Disappointing,"I am an experienced Affiliate Marketer, who was intrigued by the title and its promo contents. Although Rosalind gives a decent high-level overview of how the business works, she provides less than adequate details on how to actually get started in this business. It appears that she's more concerned with selling other affiliate programs within her eBook, including her own telephone consulting services. I am technical. If you are non-technical, there is no way you will be able to get started by using this book. I picked 1 or 2 interesting reference points, but overall the book gets a thumbs-down. My advice - save your money."
2,Disappointing!,"I purchased this book on line and unfortunately paid much more than the current price. Perhaps that is a reflection of how the information has deteriorated in value as well.For the most part, the information provided by Ms Gardner is general in nature and does not provide specific strategies which would help anyone begin an Affiliate business. She uses the book to generate even more business for herself, sprinkling a generous number of her own affiliate links.In this sense her book is nothing more than an example of how to use an ebook to generate more income in the guise of a ""guide"". She also spends a lot of time talking herself up as a guru, which does nothing for the reader.Save yourself the money and just cruise the net. You will find all the info free."
3,Too Broad to Be Effective,"Rosalind has built a solid foundation and is a successful affiliate marketer. However, reading this book probably won't help you follow her path. She covers so much ground. You won't know where to start.When she speaks, she's solid. She's a content affiliate. She writes her own content (in this case I would've enlisted help to organize and condense to make the content more useful). She gives great coaching and advice.She recently updated the book which was long overdue.If you're new and the tone is helpful and accessible but the sheer bulk of information could be overwhelming."
3,Great Performance But Don't Buy It,This is a single disk selection of only 4 pieces from the Symphoniae sacrae of 1629 and 8 pieces from the Symphoniarum Sacrarum of 1647. Cappella Augustana has also issued the complete Symphoniae Sacrae I & II on four disks as part of their Brilliant Classics Heinrich Schuetz edition; that box set also includes Schuetz's Christmas History in recitativo with chorus. Five disks of superb music for about twice the price of this one CD! The only plus to this CD is that it's recorded in SACD format.
5,Wonderful Schutz,"These interpretations are among the best I've heard.The vocalists in the Cappella Augustana are all quite good. Their approach conveys the rugged spirituality and intimacy of these pieces.There may be more vocal/ tonal beauty in other performances, but few have the rich humanity that makes their take so appealing.The SACD sound has a smoother and more present quality than other CD verisons. Sonically, I have not found a better recording of these pieces. Strongly recommended."
1,Irritating even if you know Spanish OK,"I bought this as an advanced level to try and maintain my Spanish and possibly improve it. To do the activities, you have to spend your time trying to remember which one is Asterix, which one is Obelisk, or whatever, and the non-spanish and non-english names of all the other characters. This is more frustrating than it sounds, when it asks you ""de que color fue la camisa de Asterix?"" I bought this to learn Spanish, not to play memory games about what color they colored in Asterix's shirt two cartoon panes ago. In other words, the ability to progress isn't based on Spanish knowledge, but trivia of the Asterix cartoon, which isn't even funny or entertaining. Not worth the money."
1,Horrible,"I bought this program thinking that it would help me get a basic understanding of vocabulary and putting together sentneces. The first cd is ""ok"", just gives you a lot of vocab. I went on to cd 2 and it instantly started throwing out full questions in spanish with words I have never heard before. Not sure how this program expected me to be able to answer the questions with them never teaching the filler words?! I tried all the cd's looking for the one that taught me the sentence structures, verb conjugations, etc. Not there! Worst thing I have ever bought and got very frustrated with it. Definitley a return item!!!"
4,Barron Takes the Front,"Kenny Barron, Philly-born backman extraordinaire, takes the lead in this charming and fashionable collection of original tunes. Don't expect a break from the stylish, understated music you're accustomed to hearing Barron play -- his humility is everywhere here, as he lets the younger virtuosos he has collected lead the way as much as he shines himself. A fine self-portrait of a man too frequently unrecognized in his rhythmic, polished, and energetic backing of the flashier greats of jazz."
4,Good music,Naoko Terai on violin so Good. I like Rose Noire(song title) and mind is so cool. listing by iphone3.Things Unseen
5,A cookbook worth re-publishing,"I have had this fascinating cookbook since I was 20 years old and I am now 65. The story about how I got it is practically unrepeatable so I won't publish it here. I was a young bride with some experience in cooking a few Polish dishes and a few American dishes. That was it. This book taught me what it is to cook with variety, texture, practical shortcuts, and expertise. I love to cook. I still refer to this book frequently for my old-time favorites, and often try recipes I've never made. I can say this honestly even though I now own dozens of cookbooks. (I'm now gluten-intolerant and have new recipes to learn.) I've been married three times and all my husbands were mad for my cooking. I can thank the author of this book for making at least my family dinners successful!"
4,Bass Boy - I Got The Bass,"I think this is a exellent cd, I've owned before and I plan to buying it again."
2,The History of Russia,"I used this for a course in Russia history up to the 1800's. I did not like it. Lawrence is dry and very old English. The information is brief, if anything. Please, do yourself a favor, don't buy this, just use Wikipedia. Much better, much more informed."
2,Fairly Dry,"I won't take a long time here, but I didn't find the book to be very interesting or well written. I only read it out of my own curiosity (e.g. not for a class)."
3,The Greatest?,"Well researched and an interesting read, though it is a badly edited book -- typos abound. One question, though: Why was the fight in which Louis beat Schmeling ""the greatest...of our generation,"" despite having gone to form and pretty predictably, while their fight two years earlier, in which Schmeling produced one of the biggest upsets in sports history with an intelligence rare for boxing, was apparently less great?A key moment for American society, yes. Maybe also the most eagerly anticipated fight. But the GREATEST?"
4,"Nice design, but....","straps seem a little long in my opinion. I will need to shorten them for a better fit. Otherwise, an overall nice looking and very comfy swimsuit."
2,Shoes don't fit!,"Assembly was a little difficult, but once the unit is put together it does look nice. The only problem is the cubby holes for the shoes are tiny! A typical pair of American shoes (even childrens) will not fit. Some shoes can fit singly in the holes (two holes per pair). Others don;t fit at all, especially sneakers or large shoes."
4,Overlooked!!!!,Not as good as their first one on rap-a-lot but worth checking out. Starts out a little slow but by song 8 it picks up for a strong finish. Has a great parody of the classic South Bronx called South Park. Guest appearances by K-Rino and Klondike Kat to name a few! If u want the CD hurry it's gettin' scarce!
4,Quality product but 'protrudes from your back a lot'',"Overall this product is good as a ""diaper and baby needs"" bag BUT beware how much it protrudes from your back - over 10"" when full!The standard photo is angled in such a way that this is not obvious. My wife stopped using this bag because in elevators, crowds and many other situations, she was constantly bumping people.On the upside, it seems to provide good back support, good storage and the quality is also good. With Baby in front, bag behind also provides good balance. Though we never used it when travelling, I think it would be very suitable for that as its shape seems conducive to fitting aircraft luggage bins AND its construction, zips and clips means things wouldn't easily fall out.Summary: Make sure you are comfortable with the extent to which it sticks out behind you; if you're ok with that, then this makes a great bag to support your baby needs."
4,definitely back!,"Even though the skinny one didn't receive a lot of publicity for 2000 rap dopegame, Skinny has stepped out of the industry of making music and got back to basics. High-powered beats with tongue twisting lyrics have found the artist back in the mix of it all. You've got to cop this one if you are a fan of the original ""southern-style"" banging tracks."
5,My Favorite Passover CD,As soon as Purim is over this CD gets played repeatedly in our house. It's easy to find yourself walking around the house (or at work) singing snatches of the catchy tunes. I only wish there was a Reggae Shabbat CD too!
3,"o.k. game, nothing great","Very nice graphics. I Enjoyed having the real Captains do the voices. But those are the only positives of the game. The controls were hard to get used to. I felt like every time I ordered my ships to go to warp, only half would respond. There are no checkpoints!! If you fail a mission, you have to start over again. I guess the designers of the game forgot the xbox 360 has a hard drive. After beating a few levels I got bored with it. If your a huge star trek fan you will probably want to finish the game."
3,Disappointing,"Apparently I read too much into the reviews of this product. As a long time Trekkie geek, I got my hands on this as soon as possible. The story was fun, but I found game play boring and slow.The cover states you can command a fleet of starships--but only a fleet of 4. You are able to ""purchase"" ships from a wide variety of ships from all generations of Star Trek.If you are a Star Trek fan, you will add this to your collection. However, it will not be the most played game in your collection."
4,This game is good,Star trek legacyThey have done A great job on this game. Graphics are awsome. Game play is different from any other game out there. So it takes time to get use to controls.Any one who has played all the other ship to ship star trek combat games will love this game.I just got this game the other day havent stop playing it since. I think the learning curve on it is taking me some time but Im getting the hang of ship controls. Theres nothing more exciteing to be launching photon topedoes at romulons. Not sure how the pc is but the Xbox 360 is right on. I had to change the difficuty settings to easy until I get the hang of it.
2,Star Trek Legacy - What The Hell Am I Shooting At?,"The premise for this game is good, but not good enough. I was drawn to buying this game because #1 I'm a huge Star Trek nerd and #2 I like video games with lazers. However, I'm not sold on the idea of flying a star ship around like a fighter out of Starfox. The level of detail they could have taken this game would have made it 10x as much fun (i.e. doing damage control, boarding enemy ships, etc.etc.)But biggest of all is the controls. If you are prone to vertigo, this game is not for you. The camera controls are something to be dealt with as you're always attempting to figure out where the enemy is. Good sounds, good voice actors, nooooot that good gamer control."
2,Love to Hate,PC VersionAs of this writing I am still trying to love this game. When first installed the mission loads your left in wonder. The graphics and detail are something to see. I'm a fan of most things Star Trek so I'm usually bias in any ST game. This game was not...and still is not ready for shipment. The controls are a complete mess and the multiplayer is a disaster. There are a group of us 20+ who all have legacy and play together. Out of 10 games in a session I'd say 2 go smoothly.If you'd ask if I'd buy it again knowing what I know now...yeah I'd buy it again. The game truly has alot of potential....they just really screwed it up.If your not a fan of star trek don't buy this game. If you are a fan I'd say buy it...after the kick in the nuts wears off you'll still have fun. And once you finally get a multiplayer game to run you'll love it.
2,Annoying,"The game is frustrating and annoying. It is set up as a ship combat game. But in battle expect to allow the battle to occur on auto while you meticulously do repairs on each of the ships in your fleet and instead of picking targets with an auto lock button you instead have to go to a blue/dull tactical map to tap on the enemy ships. Even when you take control of an individual ship and hit the photon torpedo button, don't expect a torpedo to launch. (the counter said I had 20 torpedoes but i think it refers to the amount of times you have to pull the trigger to get the torpedo to fire) A game that is annoying interrupted with frustration, no joy can be derived by playing this."
2,"Buggy, quirky, not fun","I think that this game is pretty quirky. The interface is difficult, the gameplay is weird, and the controls aren't intuitive. On top of all that, the storyline isn't so great. This game got boring pretty quick. Not for me."
4,Awesome Game,I purchased this game for my husband & he is so happy with it. He has wanted it for a long time. We were able to get a good deal on an X-Box recently so I came onto Amazon & ordered it. He said it is a great game with great graphics.. The company I ordered from did a wonderful job on getting to us very quickly & in great shape. Very happy with my overall experience.
2,"Not ""Star Trek"" Worthy","The graphics are really nice, but the game storyline is simplistic and does not require any thought on the part of the player. I would suggest renting it or waiting to buy it used from people like me who will toss it out soon."
1,Where have all the good Star Trek games gone???,"Oh yeah, there hasn't been one in forever. I'm a HUGE Star Trek fan and I have to say that this game SUCKS. Save your money for something else. The interface is clumsy and not well thought out. I hope that when Star Trek Online come out that it's light years better than this."
1,"Save your money, It's as bad as they come",Other than the name and deceptive advertising this game is not star trek. The graphics are poor the animation is boring. The ships are unimpressive and have little to do with star trek. They lie about re-enacting star trek episodes. It's just a bunch of lousy battles that have nothing to do with the original or other series. Ships orientation is unrelated to travel direction. Warp drive takes you out of the game area. It does not came close to taking advantage of the xbox360. I am sorry I bought this game & wasted my money. Return it before you open for Christmas you or who ever gets it will be terribly disappointed
3,Not bad...but could be better!,For the span of time it goes threw and the endless space you can explore its not to bad but overall its just a desent game.
3,Rave?,"I got this for my son for Christmas as he was raving about it.I am not a gamer. I simply watch.It took him a couple hours to master the controls, and about 16 hours to beat the game. From all the hype, I expected months of playing enjoyment for him. Once he beat it, it was relegated to the stone pile. He has not played it since. Not even on line.As far as the graphics..... Yippy skippy. I can see no appreciable difference compared to many other games he has, including those for his PS2."
3,not so great...,"the game doesn't feel right...it doesn't feel grand or epic enough. each ship should be really powerful (in different ways to be sure, like shields, armament, cloak, etc), but because you use a fleet of ships one ship doesn't matter from the other and they kill and die too fast. the fleet really is the problem, games like this should really focus on you commanding one ship as that would be sufficient. you never really feel in total command of your fleet, as you only really control every little bit of whichever single ship you are controlling at any given time.but besides the above, this is an average game. a rental (and then only for trekkies), not one for buying."
2,ver complicated!,"First off, the graphics, music, sound.... etc is amazing no doubt! However, playing the game is not interesting at all. For example, there are way too many controls for the ship that one can not navigate fast enough to avoid attacks. I'm very disappointed!"
3,Open World next time!,"Decent single player game,can't review multiplayer.Somewhat like its little brother on PS2,just better graphics.Next game,I hope,will be open world,GTA style,w/o the violence of course.Next game should not worry about trying to put every Star Trek era in game,pick one,ENT,TOS,TNG,DS9,or VOY,and make it so!"
3,It's no BC but still a great game.,This is a great game and I would buy it again. I still think that Bridge Commander is the best StarTrek game out.The GoodThis game has great graphics and some great voice talent. The game play is fun and has some great multiplayer and single player options.The BadThe subsystem targeting is there but is very poor and hard to pull off. If there was a better subsystem targeting then there might be a better ship repair system as well. The controls on the 360 are a bit hard but ok for this type of game. I think the controls will hold back the game a bit.
2,don't buy star trek legacy,The controls in this game take forever to learn and the control book still leaves you pressing the wrong buttons. This game should also include all the races of star trek not just the main ones. They should not have scraped the upgrading part of this game. They need to improve if they're going to make Star Trek legacy 2.
3,Not a very good singles game and multiplayer is average,I'm a trekie and this game is very disappointing. It looks like it was rushed past user testing. I used to be in software development and I know what I was forced to do to customers. If you're a trekie this game is a rental. Single player is quite bad except for a few moments unless you like battling to control the game. It takes a while to get the hang of it then you have to deal with user bugs that were never polished. Maybe there will be a sequel and I won't feel so bad about wasting my money on this one. It might be worth buying at $20 or under. Read the reviews on sites like [...] do not listen to the positive posts here from sellers.
2,Not what I expected,"My baby was stillborn in the summer of 2008. I felt that this book focused on miscarriage and rarely mentioned stillbirth and infant loss - despite the fact that it is included in the title. If you are dealing with miscarriage, then this is a great book. If you're looking for help dealing with stillbirth then I suggest you keep looking. I feel stillbirth is a completely different situation."
3,Paris Hilton CD,"The cd and dvd worked very well. But when I got the product, the case was all cracked and broken.However, I'm glad it works."
2,Ok,"This album is not horrible, if you enjoy mindless, feel good, I-am-hot-and-I-know-it kind of music. I enjoyed the songs, 'Stars Are Blind', 'Nothing In This World', and 'Heartbeat.' The Oakenfold remix of the song 'Turn Me Up' is much better than the album version. (You can get it on I-Tunes) As expected, she does a lot of sighing, trying-to-be-sexy kind of vocals. She usually falls flat on her face when she is trying to do this. She does not have the range or inflection in her voice to do so. Paris will never win any awards for the power of her voice.That said, I do not think she is the worst thing out right now. The majority of the popular female singers (Fergie, Kelis Cassie, Ashlee Simpson, Pussycat Dolls) have less than stellar voices. Paris is yet another artist in this group. The songs mentioned above are fun, that's all. The DVD edition provides some funny moments when Paris is talking about her 'love' of the record. If you can get this version---it should put a smile on your face."
5,one of my 5 all-time favorites,"This book is so good I rate it one of the 5 best I have ever read. It is pure adventure and will transport you to a time when a young Spaniard went to a new world, battled evil men from the Spanish inquisition, and fell in love with a beautiful senorita. Possibly the best adventure novel ever written. My other favorite books? All the Kings Men, The Hobbit, War and Peace (I haven't found #5 yet)."
4,A fictional tale of historical fact.,"I first read this book when in my teens, but missed the motion picture that was withdrawn almost as soon as it was issued. It strirred my interest in Spanish North American History which became my major in college. Recently, I re-read the book with its awful accuracy which, while its main characers are fictional, involves others who are not. It is a riviting account of the time if read purely for historic content. The scenes conjured by the writer are in no way more graphic than the truth which a history of the Inquisition can substantiate. Except for the ending I felt too conrtrived, as if seeking a way to bring his novel to an end, the book is well worth the reading. A fine introduction to the history it portrays that may lead to more investigation."
5,My all time favorite book,"Captain From Castile is my all time favorite book. I have read Samuel Shellabarger's other novels and enjoyed them also, but ""Captain"" remains my favorite. When my husband (without my knowledge)stored the box with my hardbond issue in a storage unit when we moved, where it ended up getting ruined I was very upset. I have had to be content with the paperback version. I recently thought I was going to be able to purchase a new issue version, but could not get it afterall. Hopefully, it will be re-published and perhaps the full book be made into a movie as the one previously did not deal completely or well with the true contents of the story. Its a marvelous read of a period of history full of details that are wonderful and sad and delightful to read and re-read. I have been doing so since 1964.V. Vasquez"
5,A merry and panoramic narrative,"First published in the mid-twentieth century, Samuel Shellabarger's Captain From Castile is an enduring adventure novel about Pedro de Vargas, a young Spanish nobleman who escapes to the New World when the Inquisition denounces his family. Pedro's exciting adventures (complete with swordfights, political intrigue, and romance), make Captain From Castile a merry and panoramic narrative worthy to take its place among the literary classics."
1,Flat -- Zero stars,"Worst ever! Goes flat after 2 days. Called customer service for return, they tell us they are sending another replacement and don't give us the option to return it. Guess what? That goes flat 2 days after we get it. Called service again and get no response this time when I want to return the 2 pieces of flat useless rubber.Never got my money back. Worst customer service!"
2,No Endurance,"This ball has not held up under playground play. It may be fine for home use, but after two weeks of 4-square play, at 15 minutes a day, it began going flat. Kids loved the size, but it won't hold up through even 15 min of play now."
1,Should have listed to other reviews,"I'm always skeptical about other reviews because many times people don't take the time to read the instructions or have unrealistic expectations. Well, I read the instructions and properly inflated the ball just below the recommended pounds per square inch of air pressure. I even let it remain this way indoors without kicking it for a couple of days.My expectation was that the ball would be round - it was not. I now have an egg shaped ball I need to return. I would not suggest buying this brand."
2,Flattened after 1 game of kickball,Bought this for a kickball league. After the first game the ball became egg shaped and unusable. I picked up a new ball (different brand) at sports authority for less money that seems to be holding up better. Oh well...
2,no longevity,"I play a lot of dodgeball and we tend to use these balls a lot. I purchased this one for myself so I could practice more on my own and the first day I used it the thing popped. It didn't even pop on a throw, it rolled into the grass and bumped the fence and all you could hear was ""tssssssssss"". Maybe I got unlucky but it definitely makes me leery of buying another."
1,came flat - no where does it say that or look like that in the pic,I was disappointed to receive the balls flat! Opening on Christmas morning was a dud. It doesn't say it in the description nor is it reflected in the picture.
1,I was not happy.,I was disappointed that this ball came flat. I should have been told that I need to go buy a football pump to be able to inflate it before it could be used.
2,Polk Audio DB651s,Driven with a 65 watt per channel amp. Bass is OK but high end is way too shrill. Don't recommend these speakers.
3,Poor mid-range,"These are just so-so speakers. I was not expecting great quality but since I was replacing some old speakers originally purchased at Wal***t for about 30% less, I was expecting more. Still they are OK, with good lows, fair highs, but muddy mid-range sound. As long as your expectations are not too high, you may like them."
5,DRS--,"Great speakers. Installed in my boat with no problem. Speakers arrived as planned and could not be happer with purchase. For the price, speakers will work just fine for most. Its not BOISE, but close enough for us."
5,Amazing speakers at a great price!,"I have been a fan of Polk Audio for some time now, and these speakers do not disappoint. They are very clean and crisp sounding. The bass is lacking of course, but better than I expected. Bass is for sub-woofers anyway. Very good mid range, and the treble seemed a bit brash at first, but controlled with the head unit. All in all another good quality product from Polk Audio. Way, way better than the stock speakers they replaced. Your ears won't be sorry either!"
4,Good workmanship. Not extremely impressed by sound,"I installed these in my Forester by cutting the old speaker cones out of their housing and screwing these in. Then I installed this new assembly for an obviously easy fit. The replacement was easy and went fast. However, the improvement in sound quality was less-than-exciting. They are better, but not as good as I expected from all the gushy reviews. Yes, I have a good stereo powering them."
4,Polk Audio DB651,"I am not an expert, but these speaks have a very good range. I was concerned that my system wouldn't be powerful enough (no per amp just a basic player) but they sound great and I was pleased with the price."
5,kicks a##,"i bought and put in these in my 08 glastron, with kenwood reciever, and bought a jbl 360watt amp. after hooking the 50x4 kenwood with two polk 6.50 and and two polk 5.25. amazing bass, stunning clear sound! very powerfull! i sent back thge jbl amp, never did hook it up. buy it, you will love them..."
3,Very Good especialy for the money,I needed an adapter ring that is included in the DB651. Really should have been supplied. Nice highs a little weak on the bottom end. Go for the DB651 if you have the room. Other wise speakers are very good.The speakers are very durable. My son threw a snow ball into the car and nailed one of the speakers. No damage to the speaker. Still sounds great.A better speaker is Polk DB651. same speaker just a little bit bigger and better lows.
3,No Bass,"I am not a big fan of these speakers. When the other reviewers claim that the bass is rather weak, they are not lying. These speakers have virtually no bass response. The OEM speakers sounded much better."
4,Decent for the price,"Overall good quality speaker. I'm using this off the stock head with a sub, so the lack of bass isn't an issue. Noticeably clearer than the Pioneer 6.5"" I bought for $50 /pair."
1,Worst speakers ever,"Honestly, I have listened to many speakers but those speakers are just terrible. I did not even know that speaker can be completely without bass. This is very weird, especially for the price you pay and for the brand, but they don't have bass at all. They might be good for symphonic, classical, pop or any quiet music. If you listen to rap, techno, rock or metal you will not hear any bass at all. Worst speakers ever heard."
5,Crisp and Clear!,"Installed in a 2009 Honda Accord Coupe replacing the factory speakers (which to be fair are pretty good) on the ""Premium audio 7 speaker system"". Installed very easily with self-tappers. No clearance issues or depth issues to worry about. As far as sound, these babies are sweet! The highs are really high, the mids are clear, and the bass is actually good. At first I thought bass was lacking but that was BEFORE adding an amp. Once you give these a little power, they come to life and you'll hear the bass. 'Gotta love Polk!"
4,Polk DB651 speakers,"The sound is pretty decent. For the price, not bad, bought due to name. Having no sound before other than tweaters before is sweat to the ears. They look sharp with styling grill. They do give some decent bass. However, I do have to crank sound level on radio to >20 to hear sound decent when car windows open and driving >40 mph, but that is probably a given without some amperage. They needed to be mounted on a Scosche speaker adapter and installer made it fit tight."
5,The Best,"These speakers are just so nice for the the price you pay for them.I had a pair of jl audio c2 speakers in the place these new speakers took and these new polk audio speakers sound 60 percent better then the jl audio. Other people have said that they do not have much bass,but these speakers put out enough bass to vibrate my car and very clear with no problems.I installed them in a 350z if that helps."
2,Not too great,These speakers fit in my 2013 Jeep Wrangler roll-over bard with no issues. They just don't produce the sound quality I am looking for. Also one speaker blew out with only being connected to the factory radio without any amp. I am not impressed with these. I will be replacing them with some 6.5 KICKER Subs.
5,Teachers- BUY THIS CD!,"As a teacher of 15 SLD/EMH primary students, I use this CD daily and my kids still can't get enough! The songs are catchy and upbeat and the lesson plan book offers several easy-to-do and easy-to-prepare ideas for all elementary grade levels."
3,Pleasant pop with a Nashville origin,"Fans of this Canadian-by-way-of-Nashville band's first album will find much to like on their sophomore effort. Producer Richard Marx offers up another platter of Nashville country lite, with hints of twang in a passing fiddle or guitar line, and a smooth, lightly emotional tone pitched at CMT and country radio. In many ways, this is country music's answer to the boy-band phenomenon, though in this case the band was an actual working unit, rather than one manufactured by a Svengali-like producer. Still, their material (penned by a variety of mainstream Nashville writers), and Marx's sonic trills seem more attuned to videos than honky-tonks. Overall this is perfectly pleasant, but difficult to categorize as country music, despite its geographic pedigree."
1,i still have not received this item,Dont know I ordered this item a while ago and still have not received it
4,could of been better directed,"I got nothing against this film but I believe it would have been five stars 1/2 if they would have stucked with the real facts of ramirez and his victims. If I was the director of this movie, first of all I would not have had a hard ass female cop ( good actress ) but what a joke for the film give me a break! the actress would of been better of playing a victim and danny trejo the nightstalker, I mean check the guy who played ramirez , he looks like a cross between mick jagger and a high school reject."
1,VERY AVERAGE AND SO NOISY !,"Bad acting, bad Sfx, bad directing.It's like the director learns how to film at the same time he was filming using the same camera effects... The SFX are not bad but used too many times so with the very noisy atmosphere they tried to create, it's finally very annoying ! About the Death Metal score, I guess it must be annoying for those who hates this music... And even if Ramirez was listening Metal, it wasn't Death Metal either but more like Iron Maiden,Acdc.. Death Metal and especially the one in the movie, didn't exist in the 80's or at least not in this style ! I am also not very sure the story is accurate to the true events. The end sounds a bit too much, with many improbabilities. Very average movie in my opinion. The actor who incarnates the killer looks much like the real one>"
1,Garbage!!!!,i dont think ive ever seen a movie this bad in my life i couldnt even watch it all!! i fast forwarded to the end to see if it even showed the capture as EVERYTHING else in it was completely false and never happened the way it said!! I feel that the person directing it found the special affects button and made this stupid effect rant through the whole movie!! i was looking SO forward to this movie and if i could give it-1000 stars i would! what a waste of $3!! and 1 hr of my life!!
2,Fiction is more fun then the truth,"which is readily evident in this mess of a flim; I am not sure where the writer concocted the ending for this film, but it sure wasnt inspired by the ""real"" Night Stalker. Having lived in So. Cal. when this monster was running around; Let's jsut say this movie misses on almost all the marks."
1,Horrible...,"This movie was an inaccurate account of the events leading to Richard Ramirez's incarceration. The camera work confused the audience, and the acting was poor. I think Richard deserves a better movie made about him."
1,Almost-but-not-quite entertainingly bad,"Hope really should have stopped making movies after The Paleface. This one in particular is so mean-spirited and unfunny that all you can really do is gape. Its view of marriage is right up there with the Three Stooges (remember the short films in which the three of them were married?) and enough to swear a teen viewer off the institution for life. Yet it's one of those bad movies I like to turn on when it (rarely) shows up on TV, maybe because of the now-quaint 60s art decoration and costumes, maybe because rarely before or since have performers of such talent squandered it so egregiously. (To its credit, though, I have to add that ""Cancel My Reservation"" makes this one look like ""The Magnificent Ambersons."")"
1,High Risk: Children Without a Conscience,"This highly publicized book was written in the late 1980's and contains outdated information. There is no medical proof that children with attachment issues will turn out to be the next Ted Bundy. In fact, Ted Bundy never had the diagnosis of Reactive Attachment Disorder of Infancy. The signs and symptoms listed in this book as indications of reactive attachment disorder more closely match the diagnostic criteria for conduct disorder.The authors create a false sense of urgency, to encourage parents to hurry off for controversial therapy, rather than take children to medical professionals who will take the time to make an appropriate diagnosis.Fear of unattached children is used to scare parents into seeking immediate attention.A better book to read would be It's Nobody's Fault: New Hope and Help for Difficult Children and Their Parents by Harold S. Koplewicz, M.D."
3,"High Risk, Children without a concience","The book was in worse shape than I expected. Pages very yellowed, water damage on the first few pages. It is fine for what I needed but I was surprised by the state of the book."
5,The best West African Singer,I have all his 3 CDs and i must say no one in this world plays the guitar as good as Oliver N'goma fused with the African beat. Its just a great soothing sound. Cant wait for his new materials. This is a great collection to have for long drives in the car. COLLECTOR'S ITEM.p/s anyone has Geo W. Masso another great artist.
2,just an afternoon of escape,"I love this writer as she is really clever,very versatile and as in this story when she wants to do a romance..she leaves even an older reader like myself wishing she could find a man like that.Fun easy reading and total mindless escape."
1,Another reprint! Why buy an old book at a new price?,"Personally, I feel I am being tricked when I accidentally buy a ""new"" book and discover when I get home that it is a reprint.This is another reprint, yes? I am sick of authors/publishing companies doing this to consumers. I enjoy all of Nora Roberts' books but I will not pay full price for a five (?) year old book that I could pick up for $0.25 at a garage sale or flea market or for a buck at a used book store. She is the author that seems to be doing this most often. But I guess people are buying or the publishing companies wouldn't keep doing it.Why?"
4,Good read with a surprise,"Nick and Freddie finally get together. How Nick manages to stay single without being snapped up before he turns 30 is something beyond me, but maybe he was waiting for Freddie. There is a bit of a surprise in this installment of the Stanislaski family romances and that is an update on another Nora Roberts family, the O'Hurleys. If you haven't read this series and aren't familiar with the characters, you might wonder what the point is when Nick and Freddie visit Maddy O'Hurley's home in the Hamptons with the whole O'Hurley gang present. In the world of Nora Roberts, as in life, time marches on and kids grow up to find their own way. There are the usual misunderstandings, bumps and bruises with a happy ending. Since I like happy endings, this is a pretty good read."
5,A great conclusion to a great series,"In great Nora style, this book tyed up the stalanislaski's stories, with the tale of Zack, Rachel's husband's step brother, Nick, and Freddie, Tash's step daughter."
5,"Wonderful book, but need a new cover.....","I love all of Nora's books. I travel alot for work and am sorry to say that I don't want others to look at the book cover and assume the book is filled with silly romance. Nora's books are sweet, exciting and just plan fun. Sounds pretty silly? Alot of us feel squimish that way. I appreciate your understanding. Nora's books help me keep my sanity while waiting in Airports when I can no longer think about the meeting I just left. Bless her!"
2,its ok but not the best,I think it would help by protecting your screen but it gets in the way and makes it look wierd. There is another item called thr light screen advance that has contrast control and you can close it to guard the screen plus it even has it's own light. So if you want a GBA protector buy this and a GBA case instead.
3,"protective system ,great!",this roll cage is very protective with heavy duty protection it will protect your GBA screen. When it falls not a single scratch is on it. wow!!!!
2,A little on the bad side...,"The roll cage is kind of useful, but kind of dumb. It helps protect the screen, but it looks kinda dorky and it might bother some people. The 2 bars are the things that can bother you. If i were you I wouldn't really want to buy this. If you do, just take it off when u play and put it back on. If you don't have a case, i suggest you buy this though. I gave it a 2 star because: (bad) annoying (bad) bothers view (bad) makes gameboy clumsier, but i guess its for clumsy people. (good) protects the gameboy if u drop it"
2,next to useless,"sure, if you drop it square to the ground on a flat surface larger than the cage, it would work well against scratches, but all my scratches are from things smaller than the screen and from rubbing against stuff. the cage is really annoying to play with and gets in your way and vision. it should be bought by people who like drop things perfectly of flat surfaces."
3,Not Bad,This little gizmo is preety cool because if you drop it then you won't scrap up the face of your GBA I really like it
2,i dont have it but...,"I dont have this but I wouldn't recomend it. Like one other review said its looks kinda dumb and most things that would scratch the screen are to small to be blocked by it. PLus i have been a long time Nintendo cusotmer and they built their products to withstand alot. YOu can beat the hell out of them and they still work. I personally think its a waste of money.,"
1,Roll cage,"the roll cage is stupid, who needs a roll cage for a game boy? It sounds like a waste of money to me"
1,DOESNT WORK,"THE IDEA OF THE ROLL CAGE IS GOOD BUT AS ANOTHER KID SAID,""SMALL THINGS WOULD ONLY SCRATCH THE SCREEN."" HE WAS RIGHT.ALSO IT LOOKS COOL(TO ME) BUT I WOULDNT BUY IT, IT WOULD PROLLY GET IN THE WAY A LOT TO!"
1,Where did the GOOD marketing ideas go here?,"This is a GREAT thing to have... if you want to just be annoyed beyond all means of comprehension at the little metal bars. Let's look at this from the 'proper' viewpoint.You play gameboy...You drop gameboy...You pick up gameboy...Life goes on...Unless you are a 15 foot tall giant (or just happen to be playing with your gameboy at an high elevation where there is an easy drop off nearby), you won't need this add on to your gameboy. Put the money toward college!"
1,Who?????,"I don't have this but I can already tell I don't like it. For one, it looks dumb, two most things that scratch the screen are small objects and this won't help. Please people have some common sense, Don't buy it"
3,Meager performance and underpowered,"This gun is fun, its got some nice gimmicks to it, notably the secret nozzle which will allow you to shoot your opponents when faking surrender. It also has a few different nozzle settings, one thick and one normal stream. The thick stream puts out a respectable amount of water but its range is abysmally short, probably about 15 ft while the normal stream might hit 20 or 25. There's also the hidden nozzle, of course, and a fan spray, which is also underpowered. The fan spray nozzle might get you at MOST 15 ft, making it pretty useless. This gun fails most exceptionally in power. It is extremely weak and puts out only small bursts, as it cannot build up enough pressure to put out a respectable stream of water. You can pump this up to 50 times and it still will not hold much pressure (I've tried). Don't get this gun, get the Arctic Blast, it is infinitely better."
5,Super Soaker was a blast!,"I purchased 16 super soakers for my sons 11th b-day party. All of the boys had a great time and loved the soakers. There is a fast way to fill them up in the back - you don't have to unscrew anything and it has a hidden nozzel and squirts pretty far, Highly recommend it."
5,Great fun for summer,I've had this for over half a year now. It's a great water gun for the summer times. It's not too big or bulky. It's not too heavy when filled up. You can't ask for much more at this price. Construction seems good as with most super soakers.
4,secret attack!,i used this for a water weapons assassin tournament. it's a bit bulky but ya gotta love the secret attack button. gets them everytime haha.
3,Heavy...,I bought this for my son; it is too heavy to hold when you fill up with full of water. Splashes fine and in all directions...
3,It has its moments,"In many ways this is the first real ELO record. After NO ANSWER, Roy Wood left the group and Jeff Lynne became the undisputed leader-producer-songwriter-lead singer-etc (although Wood does show up on a couple of tracks--uncredited--on cello). The album consists of 5 long tracks, all of which explore the musical capabilities of the new group. The best of the tracks are ""Roll Over Beethoven"" which is a lively cover of the Chuck Berry classic and ""Kuiama"", which contains the album's most stunning musical moment: a lovely violin solo by Wilf Gibson (I think that's his name!).The album suffers by not playing up to Jeff Lynne's main strength, which is writing radio-friendly pop songs. Also, it has not aged well, what with the over-the-top Moog parts.Over-all, though, this is a pretty good record, nothing at all like the ELO records that would follow. Of course, if you're a big ELO fan, you should have this, but that goes without saying...."
3,"A weird and unsatisfying, yet compelling, work","ELO was clearly still finding its way in 1972 when they released this strange, ponderous album. Their attempt to be ""progressive"" (in the day's vernacular) stood out in its unrestrained use of strings. Strange lyrics and muddy vocals disappoint, but respectable melodies and memorable hooks (notably in ""Mama"" and ""Kuiama"") draw the listener in. These bright spots show promise that ELO eventually realized in later works, and in that regard encourage repeated listening.But press the Skip button on ""Roll Over Beethoven."" This obvious bid for a single doesn't fit the rest of the album, and besides, the world didn't need yet another cover of this song."
1,Avoid this company,They shipped two weeks late.Do not answer their phone.I cannot speak to the quality as I was sending a gift. I would certainly NEVER order from this company again!!
3,Generally not worth the savings; go for the flash.,"I work at a professional photofinishing lab, and I can attest to the quality of the film inside this camera. The Kodak Max Outdoor camera produces mediocre results in all but the brightest of sunlight.Even for outdoor shots, a flash can really help boost image quality. As an example, using a flash when your subject is against a bright background will prevent your subject from appearing too dark.Unless you are shooting landscapes or landmarks (with nobody in front of them), you should go for the extra versatility offered by the Kodak FunSaver or PowerFlash cameras."
4,"Good professional reference book, but not for students.","Already for many years, this is a classic on optics. Almost any subject you can think of is covered in this book, in a fundamental way. That is its strength and its weakness: experienced scientists will find everything they need, but for students it is not a good book because it is far too detailed: they will get lost in all the mathematical details before they grasp the essence of the subject.This problem also exists - to a lesser extent - for professionals who try to use the book to fill in a gap in their knowledge: they too will find themselves asking why they have to read so many (well thought-through) pages before the authors finally make their point.My advice: use other books to study from, and use this book when you are already experienced and need a high-quality reference work.A note for scienctists: please mention section numbers when referring to this book in your own publications."
4,A Classic,"This book is a classic with all problems associated. Half of the reference quoted have been written before the WWII. Very useful if you like to quote original papers. This book cover most topics of the classical optics but hardy cover modern topics.However, it is hard to read and use a weird notation. Certainly not useful for rapid referencing. Like the bible, use it only when you have serious problem to deal with."
5,A masterpiece refurbished,"This classical reference in optics has been fittingly updated and enriched. A new edition of this must that should, however, be kept along the classic one. Apart from its historical connotation, the latter will be in fact highly appreciated for its clearer typography."
2,Wordy and Hard to Follow,"I set about reading this book for class. Halfway through, I was still confused about what was all happening, because it felt as though the author was writing the pages as they entered her head, with little orginization. A paragraph will cover several years of statistics, and the next will be about an entirely different decade, either later or earlier, or it will suddenly change locales without notice (white earth one paragraph, mil lacs the next, back to white earth, etc). It was also very heavily dependent on names, which also seemed to switch between christian names and anishinaabe names without notice. Finally, it felt as though a thesaurus had been dug out for most of the book, as the wording was often higher than would be used in normal conversation, which made you have to sit and think about certain words because you were unaccostomed to seeing/hearing them."
2,saki,not very good&#65292;the material was very cheap and it was also hard to cover on the seat. it was not worth
4,Not so complete?,There are other Ella & Louis CD's on Amazon with songs that aren't here. Just to save some other collectors the time. This looks like a great set if you don't have others already.
5,Eminently listenable,"The combination of Ella's honey-sweet voice, Louis' gravelly-deep one, their incredible rapport, and these lovely old songs can't fail to warm the cockles of anyone's heart."
5,Two of the Greatest,"What can you say? These are two of the all-time greats. Beautifully packaged box set and with extensive liner notes (including many pages on Porgy and Bess), I am very happy to have this in my collection. All three albums worth of material was done in '56 and '57, with a great ensemble including Oscar Peterson, Ray Brown and Buddy Rich, among others.Both stars are in high form, singing gorgeous renditions of classic duets including Can't We Be Friends, Moonlight in Vermont, They Can't Take That Away from Me, Cheek to Cheek, April in Paris, Stompin' at the Savory, Let's Call the Whole Thing Off, These Foolish Things, Willow Weep for Me, and on and on, not to mention the complete Porgy and Bess (Summertime, I Got Plenty of Nuttin, It Ain't Necessarily So...). How could you not?"
5,Can't help dancin'!,"I first heard this CD at a local swing dance place and fell in love with it after just a couple of songs. This 3-CD set is perfect for listening, dancing, or even background.I have my CD changer programmed to mix this with some other stellar choices (including Stephane Grappelli, Getz/Gilberto, and Andres Segovia), and it never fails to relax. My favorite track is ""Cheek to Cheek"", an amazing duet and a pefect dance number.You really can't go wrong with this."
2,not worth it,"I read the first book in this series because I was bored during a plane ride. I'm glad I read the book only so I can warn others away from them. It was very poorly written, with huge plot holes, unbelievable characters and impossible situations. I won't get into the theology, but it's speculative at best and wrong at worst. Don't waste your time."
4,A fun read for young adults...and me too!,"I didn't read this book to learn more about Jesus. I read it because it was hard to put down and the story intertwined the adult series books and stayed true to the original story line but from a teen's perspective. Just as reading about Narnia didn't teach me to talk to lions or watching sci-fi made me learn about quantum physics. If the book says it's "" fiction "" then sit back and enjoy the story.If you are searching for God, read the right book. It should be a reference or non-fiction genre."
1,POS JUNK!!,I have had TWO of them Flotech POS! Both FAILED right after warranty time ran out! 2 years! Flooded basement both times! Second time I put in a back up pump just in case! FLOTEC DIED and shorted out the circuit so tripped breaker so other pump could NOT WORK. Away on trip came home to 8 inches of water! Now have second circuit BUT NO FLOTEC JUNK! I Would give it ZERO Stars if let me!
4,Sump Pump,"During the recent heavy rainfall and flooding in my area of central PA, the only thing that stood between me and a flooded basement was my sump pump. I decided to get a backup sump pump in case my present one ever fails unexpectedly. This Flotec pump is the same model as the one I currently have which has served me faithfully for about 3 years. Based upon the history of the one I've had, I can tell you that it is very reliable and dependable."
3,Misleading product discription,"I bought this unit because the sump that I am taking water out of is being filled from alkali soil. The other pumps that I have purchased from this manufacturer have aluminum motor frames that act as a water seal and mechanical support for the thermoplastic pump components. One pump catistrophically failed just outside the 1 year warantee period due to the corrosion of the aluminum in the alkali water.When I received the unit I discovered that it was really no different than units that were discribed without the designation ""thermoplastic."" I had to send it back."
3,Good overall travel bag.,"I use this bag for my Nikon D90 with 18-105mm lens and SB400 Flash attached, some cleaning stuff, passport on the outer pocket, cell phone and mp3 player on the side pockets.Overall, this is a good bag for traveling as i can put lots of stuff in it. However, my back gets pretty hot and sweaty after 20-30 min of urban walking during the summer time, shoulder straps should be more padded as my shoulders will get tired after about an hour or so.Should you get this bag, yes if you not carrying lots of camera gear and you are not intend to walk with it on your back all day. This is the reason i'm giving it 3 stars instead of 4 or 5."
4,"Nice size, holds a lot, but still managable","Got it to hold my small travel outfit, D50 with 3 lens and SB-800. Already have a full sized backpack, so the 200 is a perfect compliment.Only significant weakness is the tripod holder, would prefer a vertical arrangement with the tripod supported by a cup."
5,Phenominal Backpack! Highly Recommended!!!!,"This backpack is amazing. I bought it because I knew I would need something. This bag is better than I ever expected.Currently in my bag: SB-400 Flash, 3x Filters, 55-200mm VR lens, 18-55 VR lens, camera body, lens hood, 2x battery chargers, 8x AA batteries, 3x EN-EL9 Batteries, lens bag, PnS camera, 8x SD Cards in cases (5x 8GB cards, 2x 4GB Cards, 1x 2GB Card)... I still have room for more items!This bag is awesome. It is really small but holds a ton of stuff. It is so light. I take it everywhere with me. It is incredibly comfortable! I love this bag!"
4,good camera backpack,"Purchased this for my wife to carry her D80 with two lenses. It's a smaller pack, but more than enough for this equipment with room to spare for the sensor duster, a towel, and a flash. Ideal for ladies with a DSLR camera and up to three lenses. Light, sturdy, and good interior padding for the equipment."
3,"Good pack, too small","This seems like a good backpack - very nicely padded, lots of room, well made. However, it's too small for me. I'm not really tall (5'10"") and this bag makes you look ridiculous."
5,Great Backpack,"I borrowed one of these bags for a vacation. It was fantastic! It fit my Canon 10d perfectly plus 2 lenses and other gear. There was plenty of extra room for my wallet, keys, etc... Used the bag during a bike trip, hiking and general sight seeing ... the bag was excellent for getting into and out of quickly.. and protected the gear well. I carried it on the plane also and it was the perfect size. Great item!"
2,Not a keeper for me.,"The story is outlined in depth by another reader and it's a good plot/story line actually. My problem is that I really liked the second half of the book when the plot thickened and characters became real but I hated the first half. The ""heroine"" starts off as a real turn off with her backwoodsy, live in a cave, dirty feet, etc...unreality. By the middle of the book she gets cleaned up some and becomes more appealing. I liked the hero from the beginning so I stayed with it until it got better but I wouldn't read it a second time."
5,"What I think of this wonderful book, Until Tomorrow!","This book is written in such detail it is like you are the charaters! It is a non-stop, heart throbbing historical romance that makes you want to cry and jump for joy at the same time. If you love romances with a magical, unexpected ending, this is the book for you"
2,Photos okay but horrible to use,"I took this back to the shop after a weekend with it, before even having the photos developed.Reasons:1. the zoom control has a kind of ""delayed-action"" effect to it that makes it extremely annoying and difficult to frame your shot quickly.2. The shutter release has even more of a delay. Forget action shots unless you photograph sloths and tortoises...3. The case it comes with is huge. I can't see the point of making a camera so small then supplying a case so large.Having said all this, the results from the one film I put through it were fine. So if you take pictures of things that don't move and you don't mind lugging the enormous case around, you may be happy.PS. I swapped it for a Canon Sure Shot 120 Classic which is everything this isn't."
4,Penta 115 IQ Zoom,"A very good LITTLE camera!Fits easily in a shirt pocket or pants.The zoom is adjustable all the way to 115.Tried the macro also, it came out extremely CLEAR.A nice camera...thanks again Amazon.Com & Pentaxps, many features, tried em all, they all are easy to understand, you'll be taking excellent pictures within minutes of loading the battery & film.They recommended using 400, but my first roll of 200 film worked exceedingly well.Very satisfied"
4,"Good Product, Some Cons","First of all, the name ""Hard Case"" is a little misleading -- this case is rubbery. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but something the consumer should know. The cases are very pretty and snuggly fit the ipod providing good protection.The screen cover is hard to get on the screen without causing bubbles, and it doesn't seem it would provide much protection so I eventually just took it off. I wish the ijacket had a screen cover built onto the case itself."
3,"Technically superior, but not melodic","Yes, Steve Turre is a technical wizard on the trombone. I play trombone, and I am amazed at the sounds he can get out of that tapered tube. I bought this CD just on Jamey Aebersold's recommendation, but I must admit I was somewhat disappointed at the CD contents. I guess it would be nice background music at a party, but I really don't listen to it very often at all. I like melodic music - music you sing to yourself, something you can follow and perhaps imitate. But most of the songs on this CD are ad lib solos and technical gymnastics, most with a latin feel. It was just not what I was looking for in trombone music. If you like the same type of music that I do, try J.J. Johnson, Kai Winding or Wycliffe Gordon first."
3,Travel Bag,"This items was smaller than I had hoped for-quality seams to be good though, could make it a bit larger"
5,Sturdy and reliable,"I bought this for my son for Christmas, to replace the one that he lost.He uses it for some of his overnight stays.It looks really nice and sturdy."
4,Super fun toy!,My kids got this for LAST Christmas (at ages 2 & 4) and they still love it this year.
2,4 1/2 year board with game!,"It's fun and educational, but too simple. They match cards to pictures on board, such as shapes, colors and numbers (up to 4). Unfortunately, it is not challanging enough. My 4 year old was board with it after playing twice and my six year even more. And, honestly, as a parent most of my kids' games bore me, but this was the worst!"
3,Not as great as i had hoped!,"I bought this game for my two boys (6 & 3) last year for Christmas. Yes, it is a neat game at first, but my boys pick up on things quickly and this game was way too easy and got old fast. They do like playing with the balls and the key. I wish they (as in Cranium) would have been able to incorporate more of the jewels or treasures for winning, because that was what my boys found fascinating at first. Then they kept on saying ""Is that it?"". I was not impressed at all.I wouldn't buy this game for children who already have even a small understanding of numbers and colors."
3,A Little Too Easy,"I got this game for my 3 year old and 6 year old. My 3 year old is just learning his ABCs and I was hoping this would help BUT it only has A, B and C - the three letters he really knows. I was hoping when it said ""ABCs"" on the box that it would utilize the entire alphabet. My 6 year old plays with my son but it is really too easy for her. It also only covers the numbers 1-4 (1-10 would have been better.) They are having fun with the game and it's easy enough that I don't have to supervise, which is nice. One more thing - they quickly figured out that you can peek and try to find the ""hidden"" balls. I would classify this more as for ages 2-4 instead of the 3-6 stated on the box."
4,An instant hit,"This got the immediate ""thumbs-up"" from my 4-yr old daughter. She had me playing it over and over and over and when I had enough she carried on alone. I like that the game can be made more advanced by changing from the beginner cards to the advanced cards provided in the box.I would have granted the game 5 stars if the balls didn't occasionally get stuck so that when all the doors are open there are still balls not found. I have learned to check there are no balls in the secret tunnels before the play commences so it is no big deal.I would certainly look at other games in the Cranium series."
5,We love this game!,My girls (ages 4and 2) ask to play this game over and over again. They love to see if the balls are under the compartments and they love when they open up the jewel at the end of the game. It is definitely a must have game!
3,Fun for lower end of suggested age range,"My four year old got this from Santa for Christmas and loves it, but her 6 yr old sister was quickly bored. When a door is open, it is pretty easy to see the ball if it is in the next slot. I would have recommended this for 3-5, but not for kindergarteners."
3,to easy,"My daughter is 5 and it is to easy. We played it a few times and got bored. Good for a 2,3 and some 4 year olds."
2,Too Easy for the Age Range given,"My 4 year old received this for Christmas. This game is too easy for him and hasn't taught him anything new. The age range for the game is given as 3-6 but if your child already knows blue, red, yellow, green, can recognize A, B, C, knows a circle, square, and triangle, and can count up to 4 objects then the game will teach your child nothing new. I would say the age range is better from 2-3.5. It is too bad that Cranium doesn't make and additional set of cards that have more numbers and letters on it. I guess I can make my own but for $$ it should be included."
4,Great first game for little ones,"Fabulous game for little ones! My daughters loved it when they were 2 and 3 and still ask to play it even now that they know their ABC's and 123's quite well. It's a great game even when you can't play it the ""real way""...very few games are like that without running the risk of losing all the pieces! I'd highly recommend it for young ones!"
3,short lived fun,"My 3 yr old enjoyed the game for a couple of weeks but it became boring to her after some time. Not too much excitement. Definately good for a toddler who is learning their numbers, shapes and alphabet in their beginning stages only."
5,Family Fun,What a great game! This is so different from all of the basic board games. My 3 1/2 year old daughter received this in December and she and my husband and I were all immediately hooked. The best parts of this game is that it is faster than traditional board games and that there is no real winner - everyone is working toward the same goal. My daughter is even willing to play this alone!!!
5,3 year old son wants to play all the time!,"We bought it as a gift for Christmas and have hardly put it away. We play together or sometimes I catch him playing it by himself. It's extremely easy and fun to play and educational. One thing I'd like to see is additional game pieces to include other numbers, colors and shapes. Otherwise, we made a great choice of a game. Thank you to the other reviews that help me decide to buy this game. We, the adults, also like to play Cranium."
3,Kids enjoy for the most part,"Our children received this game for the Eid Holiday. The kids enjoy playing it, but- Game was not designed well, and we have to pass on the turns many times during the game because there are not enough answer options on the board for the expansive questions in the deck of cards.- The balls sometimes do not fall in the holes like as they are supposed to.The kids nonetheless have a great time with it and always insist on playing it (thanks big sis)"
4,Very educational,"My 3 year old daughter LOVES this game. It's challenging enough that she is learning, but not too high-level to frustrate her. She plays every night before bedtime. She loves games and this is her favorite."
2,"No brainpower required for this ""Cranium""","It looks like a neat toy, and is fun to use, but it becomes boring after a short time, even for young children. There is no strategy, and no brain power involved. With a little thought, the game makers could have made this a game that would keep kids and parents interested longer. An o.k. first game for 3 year olds, but I wouldn't waste money on it. A much better choice: good old Candyland."
2,Maybe I'm missing something...,"I was excited to play this game with my 3.5 year old daughter after reading all the stellar reviews. I have to say I'm a bit disappointed. I think the concept is great, and my daughter loves playing with the balls and opening the doors with the key, but I think it could have come with additional cards to vary the game up a bit. I don't think it even has enough cards to cover all the letters in the alphabet. I flipped the cards over and tried the ""advanced"" version, but we conquered that in 1 night. I just expected more from this game. Overall, I think there are better learning games out there for the age range."
3,Fun until you get passed the ABCs or 123s,"This game is fun and very educational. Both my boys(3,5) like to play this game but they already know more than just A..B..C and 1..2..3. Now they just like to play with the colorful bouncy balls and throw them off the floors and walls.I would recommend this game for children who are just starting out and haven't learned their numbers or letters."
3,"Ok game, not worth the current price","The game is fun at the beginning, but my 4yo is already getting bored (had it for a month). It's good for teaching shapes, colors and 1-4 counting for the younger kids but many games below $80 can do that. Kids quickly learn how to cheat, if you sit to the side you can see where the balls are. Even my 2.5yo learned this. Also, the balls are very bouncy (which kids love) but you have to chase them all over the room, I am sure some will be lost eventually and then the game doesn't work. I assume when it first came out it was cheaper and a decent purchase at lower prices. But at current prices it's way overpriced for what it is."
4,Terrific Beginner Game for Preschoolers,"This was a favorite game for my two kids. I'm sorry to hear that it might no longer be manufactured? Even though my kids have outgrown it, they still want to keep it and love using the key to open the doors.As preschoolers, the idea is perfect. They don't need to know how to read and their level of learning can be at colors or shapes, beginning letters, or groups of 1, 2, or 3.Finding the balls is a joy to little kids and getting to use the key is super cool. When the treasure box opens, they are thrilled.I would recommend placing your child at the front of the game. Otherwise they can see sideways through the open doors to the bottom of the game and see if there are other balls nearby.They also always wanted to take the jewel out of the treasure chest but it is fixed in place. It would have been cool to have it removable.Sorry to see this game in limited availability but if you see it at a yard sale, pick it up!"
4,Great learning toy--fun for everyone!,"This is a great toy. My daughter has figured out all the letters and pictures, colors, and shapes. She loves it. It's great fun."
5,4 yr old boy with autism loved it!,my 4yr old boy with autism loved this game! We bought him several games this Christmas and he keeps wanting to play this one ALL the time. I think they did a great job designing this game and the colors are attractive. I hope they plan to expand and add additional game cards in the future. Educational & Fun!
3,Just okay,"This game is fun for a few times, but then it gets really boring. It would be so much better if you could vary the cards on the little doors and do different kinds of matching. The way it is my kids haven't found it too challenging. They like playing with the balls though and opening the doors with the key."
5,"Had it for a year so far, and my 4-year-old still loves it!","My son got Cariboo as a gift for Christmas 2003, and shows no sign of getting bored with it! It's a fast-paced, fun game that I enjoy playing nearly as much as he does. Incidentally, my 2 1/2 year old daughter is starting to show an interest in the game, so I see lots more ""Cariboo"" in my future."
4,Fun Game!,"My daughter loves this game!!! She started playing it when she was two (she is now 3). It is very well made, and I like the way it is contained in the box. My three year old will play it by herself or with her older sister. I don't have to do anything! Great time to make lunch or dinner."
4,Fun for little kids,"My kids loved this game when they were 3 and 5. At 5 and 7 they have definitely outgrown it, since they've figured out that it's not too hard to see where the balls are if you look right (what kid can resist that?!). It was great fun for them to discover the balls, and the highlight of the game of course was opening the treasure chest. For the adults, though, it took a lot of patience to play it over and over again with my kids. But for little ones that enjoy matching/memory games, this is a wonderfully interactive game that is a step up from the classic memory card games."
3,Great but for a younger than advertised for set!,"It's a great, fun game. But my 5 year old looked at me like I had 4 heads when we played this game. It's basically a colors and shapes game and unless the child is very young--the randomness of the game loses its excitement after about 4 turns...I did give it to my friend and her 3 year old--they think it's great fun. So it's great-just a bit on young side. I will try the Cadoo version and see if that's the right speed."
4,"Recommended, and adaptable!","I was unsure when I ordered this toy, due to the varying reviews. However, now that we have it in hand, I can say that I definately recommend it. Both my three y.o. boy and six y.o. girl love it. It's a good challenge for him, and way too easy for her, but the mechanism fascinates both equally. And, even though the previous reviewers were correct in saying that the ""academic"" content is quite limited (ABC, 123, red-green-yellow-blue), it will be a simple matter to make it more complex by creating my own cards and door covers and substituting them for the factory ones. Soon we can branch out to DEF, etc., and I can even see putting addition facts on the top of it for my daughter. I'm surprised Cranium doesn't provide supplemental card and door sets. In sum, the toy is somewhat limited in what it can teach, but with a little parental creativity this can be a great teaching/playing tool for a while to come."
4,Fun for ages 2-3,"I was disappointed the first time we played Cariboo. I expected more from Cranium especially for ages 3-6. My kids ages 4 and 6 were bored with it after 1 or 2 times playing it. Not only that, after they changed the cards from basic to advanced twice, the cards became bent and now don't fit on the doors very well.With that said, my two year old loves it and will benefit from learning colors, shapes and basic counting and letters. Bottom line, if your children know their shapes, colors and letters, this game is not for you. It is good for children ages 2 to 3 and possibly early 4's.A better game for ages 5 and 6 (and some 4 year olds) is Blink, a card game that teaches shape, color and number recognition. It is fast-paced and actually fun for parents, too! (unlike Cariboo) It is our favorite family game and is half the price of Cariboo."
5,Great Gift,"What a great game for your Pre schooler. My Son cannot get enough of this game. I love the fact that it really makes the kids think and make choices. The cards have either a color, number or shape on them. The child has a number of windows that match the card. After choosing one they use the key to open the window and see if there is a ball. Finding the balls is so much fun for them. We close the window after opening it so that it also makes them remember if they already checked that window. You put all the balls in the treasure hole and when all six are found the treasure opens.Another great thing about this is that your child is able to play by himself. My Son often plays with the cat. Definatly a great toy for 3-4 year olds. 5 year olds will still like it but will find it less engrossing."
5,great family fun,"My 4yr old daughter got this for her birthday, and she loves it, it's an easy game that the whole family can do together. It teaches colors, shapes, numbers. We recommend it for anyone who is looking for a game that doesnt have small pieces and is easy enough to understand for small children to play."
2,Made for a 4 year old but only 18 month old is interested,"My four year old received this toy as a birthday gift but he already knew his numbers, basic numbers and shapes so it didn't sustain his interest. My 18 month old on the other hand loves the key and enjoys trying to find the balls underneath the various doors.I think there are much better toys on the market for 4 year olds."
2,The Emperor's New Preschool Game,"I believe this game's good reviews and awards are a result of the Cranium namebrand rather than on the merits of this particular game. Our 4 1/2- and 3-year-olds played this for about three rounds before they lost interest in the ""concept"" of the game, and basically just wanted to play with the ""treasure balls."" Even the ""advanced"" play was easy for the children, and, really, how exciting is opening the same treasure chest with the same chintzy purple jewel over and over and over again anyway? The one good thing that I do have to say about the game is that it is not competitive but rather team work-oriented, but overall it was a waste of money. Cranium could have done better for its preschool gamers."
5,Great learning game,I bought this game because it was requested by my childs speech teacher. The game is a must have for little ones. I have changed the pictures to make the game more difficult. getting the chest to open at the end is the greatest thing.
5,My 3 year old loves it,To play this game you draw a card and match the card to a card on the board. The cards on the board flip over so you try to find the balls underneath. When you find a ball you put it in the slot on the side and when you find all of them you can pop the treasure chest open. It's very different and it's fun too. It's easy enough for my 3 y/o and it has 2 sets of cards one is easier than the other.
5,Perfect for the Novice,"This is a great book for the beginner. A must have for anyone restoring this classic automobile. From beginning to end, this book is filled with detailed instructions on disassembly to a concours quality show car. Noteable book topics: History of each year (64 1/2 to 70). Information on how to choose and buy a Mustang. Exploded diagrams. Tons of helpful photographs. Data plate decoder. Highly detailed interior restoration. Body work (rust repair and paint). Step by step instructions make it nearly impossible to get it wrong."
4,Outstanding overview for restoration,"I am currently restoring a 66 FB, and found your book very helpful by providing an outstanding summary of items to be considered during restoration. Great value for the price. It covers many of the components and how to work them. However, additional information needs to be found from other sources for more specific detail. Examples are specifications, bolt torques, etc.In summary, it's great, but not a standalone book."
4,Mustang Restoration Handbook,I purchased this book along with two others; Chiltons service manual for early Mustangs and the parts interchange book. As a package they are three volumes one must have if doing a restoration project.It contains many good tips and recommendations for making restoration more efficient and enjoyable.
3,Outdated,"Overall not too bad of a book. I'll just use it as a reference though. It has exploded views and some stuff on dissassembly and different things to look for, like common damage. BUT, and it's a big but, this book could use some updating. The pictures are really old and some of the tools and methods are outdated. Seeing them use an oxyacetylene torch to make cuts or weld a quarter panel on makes me just cringe...."
5,GREAT BUY!,"Great book,bought for Brother in law who's rebuilding a 1967 Mustang,he said it had a lot of useful information.He wants the rest of the collection now."
5,Mustang Restoration Handbook,Found this book added a lot of insight in my grandson's immense project and he has been using this book quite a lot.
4,On The Beach - B&W - 1959,"On The Beach was a film I saw long ago. It is good now as it was when I first saw it. I only wish it was originally filmed in color.Originally done in 1959, there was a remake done in 2000 that was a made-for-TV mini series. Although it was somewhat updated, I still prefer the original movie with Gregory Peck (although the remake did fill some holes the original movie failed to address).On The Beach is very sobering about the implications after a full-scale nuclear war. What would have made this a ""5"" star is if there were two DVD's included showing cuts/deleted scenes, the science involved, and a commentary from the remaining cast and crew involved in the filming of On The Beach.I recommend the original black & white movie. If you like it, then rent or purchase the 2000 remake and decide which version you like best."
1,No DVD,"How can review something I have been waiting months to get? HELLO, HELLOO HELLO HELLO HELLO LOL LOL LOL LOL"
1,Disappointed,"""On The Beach"" would not play in my DVD player. What do I do?I really like this movie and would like to get one that I canview!Please adviseThanksLynn"
4,Book to Movie...,"The other reviews here say enough about the movie being powerful and well-done, but I'd like to add that as good as the movie is the book is ten-fold better and more powerful. It is the most emotionally powerful book I've ever read, and a sf atomic bomb classic. Look up Nevil Shute in the book section. Shute's ""A Town Like Alice"" is well worth your while too. It's a World War II story based on a true story."
4,The Final Act in a Nuclear War,"On The Beach presents the grim result of any conflict that ends in nuclear war.The only survivors (in this story) were those in remote regions of the southernhemisphere, and even those had the grim reaper coming their way, only a few monthsafter the rest of the world's population was wiped out by the nuclear conflict.It is a good story of the war we avoided during the ""cold war"" with the USSRfor some thirty years, and especially a good story of the lives of those whosurvive the initial outburst, only to face an upcoming certainty of death byradiation poisoning. It is a very good argument for preventing nuclear war, whateverit takes to do that, other than a total surrender to the forces of evil."
4,Great Prelude to Nuke movies!,"On The Beach was one of the first Nuke movies, I did enjoy the film, However I am 35, My dad loved the Movie, I loved the Movie and the plot, But there were no emotions, These people are going to die! I recommend this film highly, for the older Seasoned members whom were living at the time the film was Made. Circa 1959. I must however recommend the remake, If you have not seen the Showtime On the Beach remake, you are missing a lot, The remake brings the futuristic setting, a War between China and The USA. Highly believable, Special effects. It stars Armand Assante, Bryon Brown, And Rachel Ward, of the Thornbirds fame. If you are into Nuke Movies like I am, I suggest you Get both of these movies. you will not be disapointed"
3,Pure camp,"The acting is old school and the movie in it's day was, a had to see. It was made just before the cold war ended and is an insight into the archaic thought process that helped make our country miss a beat with the rest of the world. If you are over 50 ,and a conservative, bye it and put in your worship pile. if you are over 50 and a liberal have a good laugh and resell it. if you are under 50 you had better buy it for self defense from the conservatives and the liberals."
1,On the Boring Side,"This movie was SO DISAPPOINTING!! Ava Gardner was irritating with her lack of acting skills. Gregory Peck was not convincing as a smitten man. In fact, he must not have been smitten not to have stayed to be with her at the very end. There was no chemistry between them. I thought Anthony Perkins was weird as a newlywed. The production values and writing were poor. Very sorry I bought this."
1,On the Beach,"On the beach did have interesting scientific information. BUT it didn't have an interesting plot, it is not well presented through the language...it had a good topic and a good idea however it did not appeal to me and my class. when i started reading the book, i knew how it ended... there was not enough on how people feel and react and it's more about the scientific and technical things. Also, it was not realistic on how the people reacted to the situation."
4,On The Beach,"I really was moved by the book, even though the writng is not the best.(I haven't seen the film yet). But I do have one major complaint. The baby in the story is continually referred to as ""it""! Once in a while the author adds a ""she"" but it is not much of a help. Know anyone who calls their child ""it'?"
3,"None too Faithful to the novel and not the best film, but some affecting moments","Glamorized version of Shute's celebrated novel about the end of the world after nuclear war. Of course we all know by now that this scenario has some scientific holes in it; that Gardner is a dozen years too old for the part (and Fred Astaire is even older), looks it, and has no Aussie accent whatsover. But the film, like the novel, has a strong emotional core and despite its flaws, is still packs a wallop because it asks a question that has no one final answer - what would you do if you knew when you were going to die? Aside from the rather heavy-handed talk about the dangers of nuclear war, On The Beach is still a very watchable film and for me, something you have to be in the mood for. And I am a sucker for the films final scenes of a deserted city and the town center with the large banner flapping in the breeze, ""There is STILL TIME - BROTHER""."
5,You Must See This Film,"Despite the age of the film, after seeing it you will never be the same. It is powerful. As the world comes to an end you see human nature take many forms. You will never forget this movie."
4,Grand!,"I read the book first and nearly cried. One of the most human stories I have ever read. Soon I found out that a movie had been made and bought it after much search. It was gallant! The end, in particular, touched the depths of my soul and made me shiver at the thought of the world coming to such a horrific end. The only reason one star was not added was the weak and dull preformance given by Peck who seems to miss out on the humane part of his character. He simply looks boring. Astaire suprises. All in all, a great movie but one should read the book first."
5,De JaVu,"This is a great film that I imagine few of the young people have seen today, and with all the nuclear accidents, it would behoove them to view this. A great great film when it came out and even better now that I am older. I recommend it highly"
5,perfect,"It still resonates, although I see the problem now as nuclear waste, not weapons, and the final result will be pretty much the same....not with a bang, but a whimper."
3,Doesn't Ring True or Dig Deep,"I remember being shaken up by this when I was a youngster. After watching it for the first time in over 30 years, I was very disappointed by the script. The concept is great but the script feels so so false. I just kept thinking that this isn't how people would really act. Nor did it dig at all into the various social, moral, ecological & philosophical complexities."
2,No English Captions,"I was disappointed to discover that it only has French and Spanish sub-titles, I still buy a lot of DVD's because they have sub-titles, something which for the most part is not available on my APPLE-TV.For an old hearing impaired pilot this is a problem.The product info area should tell which languages are Captioned."
5,The Best Alternative Rock CD of 1999!,"I became hip to Poole after a friend lent me his copy of ""Alaska Days"". I was a fan immediately afterwards. Their new CD ""Among Whom We Shine"" is the best yet. It not only demonstrates Poole's excellent songwriting skills, but also showcases their abilities to produce. I would have to call the vocals on the new CD, nothing less than angelic and shimmering. Hopefully, this CD will be strongly supported by their label Spinart and Poole will get the recognition that they deserve."
3,Good info but not always accurate,"We recently came back from St Thomas and used ""The Best of ..."" while I found that there is a lot of good and usefull information in the book I also found that many of the phone numbers and locations were incorrect. This was a bit of a pain, but all in all I found the book most usefull. I would definitely recommend it for the first time visitor. Just use the yellow pages for phone numbers. <I>This text refers to the previous printing of this title.</I>"
2,For New Comer's,"This book provides very basic information on St. Thomas and limited information on St. John. The 1st timer to these islands may find this information helpful, however, most of what is included can be found in other sources which are readily available elsewhere. Other than the beautiful picture of Trunk Bay on the cover, the book provides no other pictures. Which, in my opinion, is a shame because the real magnificence of these islands would be better conveyed through some select pictures and not just text alone."
3,so so,"The information is good, and seems thorough, but the presentation is lacking...not a single photo, and the maps look juvenile."
3,Disappointed with description for Caneel Bay Resort,"I was orignally booked at the Westin in St. John. Since this book described the Westin as ""busy and bustling"" with children and families. I opted for Caneel Bay which was much more expensive because of the the review in this book which described Caneel Bay as quiet and romantic. I can only assume that since this book was published, Caneel now encourages children. Unfortanately it cost me $7000 to discover this!"
3,Best of St. Thomas and St. John,"This book needs to be updated. The St. John Inn was hardly an elegant, intimate little inn. We were so disappointed we hunted down alternature accommodations. However, the ""Inn"" still charged us."
3,"The Best of St. Thomas and St. John,U.S. Virgin Islands","The book was some what informative. The price of taxis in the islands is very high.Coral world was not what I thought it would be as in the book.There was nothing there.I don't know when the author was in the Virgin Islands last, but there are things I would not recomend.Like shopping for jewlery and other things were very expensive. We were in the Islands from 7/29/07 to 8/05/07. We were told this was their off season maybe this is why things cost more. Overal the book did give some usefull tips.Ann Morris"
2,"So, bad I returned it!","I hate books that refer to objects but neglect to include a photograph. It's 2005, I need visuals."
5,blind date DVD,"A pretty stupid movie that two great stars, Basinger and Willis turn into a superbly entertaining two hours. Loved it and must be watched several times, it is so entertaining"
4,Fast & Funny,"Moves faster than a scalded cat. Different role for Kim and she plays a drunk to a tee. I didn't know what to expect from this romp, and the ending, though not surprising, was satisfying."
3,"Okay, not perfect.","Blind Date was pretty funny, but I definitely don't think that it was either Willis's or Basinger's best movies. I also don't think that it was hysterically funny. It had some funny parts in it, but 3 stars is all I give it at the max."
2,Not as bad as I remembered it,I saw this movie back then. And I can remember thinking this was another 80s movie showing a spoiled American generation who had no respect for anything . . . that was wasteful and greedy. Well I watched again it recently and it didn't seem all that bad. I mean it was typically 80s . . . for sure. But after having seen just disasters like Bridesmaids and The Hangover . . . this movie seemed quiet controlled. I just realized in hindsight that Kim Basinger plays a lot of characters who can't seem to hold their alcohol . . . or who seem to react strongly to it . . . . Anyway she was not a blond back then. She had brown hair in this movie. Whatever. The movie's ending was true Hollywood. And the clothes and house was all 80s. Good to reminisce with.
2,Love at First Drunk?,"Storyline very contrived as Kim and Bruce profess their love for each other on a rather slick squeaky sofa/chair after one long extended blind date. It just didn't make sense, you really have to suspend belief that their relationship barely a week old and bereft with alcoholic stupors could be genuine. Rent it if you want, Larroquette is funny as the obsessive crazed ex-boyfriend and Bruce has fun with this as his first screen outing and Bassinger plays drunk fairly well. But unless you can find it in a bargain bin, it's not worth buying"
1,Worst movie ever,"I have only walked out of a handful of movies, and this was one of them. Everything about this movie was contrived and stilted. While Blake Edwards has produced some classic movies, this simply is not one of them. I recommend S.O.B if you're looking for a truly excellent Edwards film"
3,What happened?,Only watched half and when I tried to Resume the next evening the system wouldn't let me. Did I do something wrong?
5,A reminder of what music can be when Skinny Puppy goes cynic,"Back when this record was released i was in the midle of my teenage punk rock crisis. Tired of everything and anything. Then came HILT. Everything came into place, sweetnes invaded every crazy corner of my mind and life went on. Just to say that this album KICKED IT. And will kicck it forever. Buy it only if you think you deserver it.Que viva el RoCK!"
2,Two stars: Only because of cEvin and Dwayne,"Wow, so cEvin and Dwayne were capable of producing crap!This is some really gay teen goth dance crap. A must for hard core Skinny Puppy collectors only, and by that I do not mean that this album is in any way hard core. It's more like,""hey, let's get a bad singer and make an album""!"
5,This All Creatures Great and Small Special really is,"The reason that this DVD of the ""Specials"" has been teamed with Series 3 is that it picks up exactly where Series 3 leaves off with James Herriot going off to war in a car. The Special has him returning the same way and resuming the practice that he left before the war. The cast is virtually the same save for the housemaid, who is shown to have passed away in a slightly touching scene. This 2 special DVD shows Siegfried with a moustache and slightly older and Tristan as a now successful government employee in a town nearby. We are updated unexpectedly (unless you had read the novels) of James's family with a son and eventually a daughter. The pleasantness and wonderful country atmosphere remain as if we had never left and the specials conclude the series in a nice way. A sure pill for our times and relaxing to watch."
4,Only two of the specials,Just a word of warning: this volume only contains two of the three ACG&S specials.
5,James Herriott's specials,Highly recommended. Warm and interesting stories from All Creatures Great and Small. I just wish there were more of them on this DVD. The price is much more affordable than the DVD sets.
5,All Creatures Great & Small - The Specials,I was absolutely charming. I watched the whole DVD without interruption. I wanted to in the moment the whole time. I rate this the hightest possible.
3,overly cutesy movie,"The idea of the movie of 4 young female outlaws is interesting, but the maudlin, cheesy music stinks the movie up a bit. This movie is just okay.They could have gone further with the character development and cut out some of the cutesy girly giggling."
2,Bad,"This writer is terrible, 30 preview sample pages is all I need before wasting my money. Her sentences are jumbled and all over the place which makes for a terrible uneven flow. She describes 5 or more characters in 3 pages which has me so confused as who is who..I even tried 'The Right Address' and felt the same inexperienced nonsense and hoopla. And describing things just goes on and on, I found myself skipping pages just just to get it overwith. Her books are boring and pointless."
3,Based on a true story...,"I cannot believe that I am the only one to mention this. Wolves in Chic Clothing is based on an article that appeared in NY Mag in 1998, called ""Welcome to the Doolhouse"". It chronicles what happened when real life socialites Lara Shriftman and Alex Von Furstenberg remade Alice Larkin. Larkin then stole Samantha Kluge's husband. The real story is much better than this drivel-google it."
1,Wolves In Chic Clothing,"Flat, pedestrian cliche parody of Sexy in the City, Devil Wears Prada, Nanny Diaries. Clearly living on the fumes and riding the coat tails of the stories listed above, Wolves In Chic Clothing is just one glass of cheap champagne.The story centers on a group od NY society womens who adopt a young and stylish girl to be their project (hello My Fair Lady). And yawn, all the clumsy descriptive curly-ques. Talk of ""well heeled"" Manolo wearing, Prada toting bitchy inner intrigue of a bunch of characters who are as boring as predictable.The story line boils down to some tired and dated message of ""Rich people are bad people"", ""Poor people are real people"".Don't waste your time. Buy yourself a DVD of Sex In The City, Or Devil Wears Prada for the real thing.Wolves In Chic clothing is the Designer Imposter of books."
4,Fun Beach Read,"Carrie Karasyov and Jill Kargman have collaborated again to bring a fun, entertaining story to our beach chairs. Julia, their endearing heroine, finds only disaster when she falls under the dangerous spell of glitz and glamour. When she meets the ringleader of a group of manipulative Manhattan elitist girls, they take her on as their ""winter project,"" intending to make her over into one of their own. It's a fun story that includes many yummy jabs at the sometimes moral corruptness of New York high society. I liked it! I totally look forward to their next book."
1,Horrible trite garbage,After spending two hours reading a paperthin plot with plastic characters I could not believe I wasted my time or money. Went to get refund. The plot was ridiculous as the characters were an insult. Could not believe this was published. No wonder there were so many on shelves still. Garbage.
3,The Right Address? Not,"Book was only ok. I liked the first novel better. This one reminded me too much of Eliza Doolittle and Professor Higgins. If I didn't know better, I'd swear that is where their inspiration came from. It's worth the read but I'd borrow it from the library instead of buying it."
1,Bad bad bad,"This book was so eye-popingly bad that it made Bergdorf Blondes seem like Tender is the Night...don't waste your time, don't waste your money.....it amazes me that drivel like this still gets published all in the name of the ever so popular ""Chic Lit""....please! Spare me!"
4,Working Girl Power!,"Loved this book. Cool, stylish working girl makes it into snooty NY ""in"" crowd. Soap opera-like story of the 20-something rich and glamorous...how they are gorgeous, miserable and menacing. The heroine is likable and, of course, comes out okay in the end. Feel good story that I enjoyed reading. Definitely recommend it if you like chick lit!!!"
1,Waste of time!,"Yikes! I usually like chic-lit now and then, especially when it takes place in NYC....but this was just a waste. It was very immature, and badly written. The plot was all over the place, the characters were foolish and it was hardly humorous. I much prefer chic-lit writing that is witty, and perhaps makes a little sense!"
2,Predictable,"I found the main character, Julia, hard to sympathize with. She had no backbone and was chasing her boss' husband. When she got fired for it, why all the shock? Not a very likeable character. Ending up with Oscar was too convenient to be believable. Disapointing."
2,Glamour girl chick-lit...,"I've read other books that fall into this chick lit sub-category (Bergdorf Blondes, etc) and found that there is a thin line between love and hate of the uber-rich who star in these stories. The protagonist usually is someone who is not ""born"" into the lifestyle, so we can usually side with her. However, if the protagonist is just completely clueless, well, do we have to? In this story, a group of heiresses decide to take Julia Pearce, a salesgirl, under their wing...until something better comes along to distract them at least. Julia, who was supposed to be so ""down to earth"" doesn't bat an eyelash when her new ""friends"" get her a promotion, a makeover, and a fake pedigree. Add in some more stock characters (like the token gay best friend) and you've got the bulk of the story. Can anyone else see how this will end? Sure, chick-lit can be formulaic sometimes, but come on here ladies!"
1,Not worth the time or money,"I borrowed this book from a friend after she gave it a great review. I was hopeful at the beginning, but the book dragged on and I had to force myself to finish it. It was very immature, poorly written, and the plot was all over the place. By the middle of the book you knew what was going to happen, and I couldn't wait to finish it. Not worth the time or money.. skip this one and read an original not set in NYC Chick Lit Book."
1,Worst Purchase I've Ever Made!!,"This tutu should not even have been released to sell. It is a piece of junk. Other reviews say it would be for a 3 year old or younger but it will not even fit a two year old! My daughter is two and average sized, so on her the body is too short and the straps are too long. It does not even cover her chest and then you have the wonderful tutu part that sticks straight up, maybe this part was meant to cover the chest area! Then you bring out the slippers that are included, which are way too big for a two year old. Basically, I would not recommend this item for any child, no matter the age!"
1,Tutu TOOO small,The size for this item is said to be for child 3-10. When I received this item the tag clearly read size4-6. My child is average size for 7 years old. She could not have worn this 2 years ago. The item needs to be clearly posted with the actual size. My daughter was very disappointed when she saw how small it was. So much for dress-up!!!!!!!
1,BEWARE - SIZE IS A FRAUD,I bought this for my 6 year old because the age states up to 8 years old. The size is only for a 2-4 year old. I was extremely disappointed (as was she) because this was a Christmas present and she could not wear it.
1,Don't waste your money!,My daughter got the bella dancerella dance studio and tutu and slippers. The tutu is absolutely ridiculous! It was either sewn wrong or packaged wrong so the tutu sticks straight up! We have tried everything to fix it and it will not lay down. It is poorly made and very disappointing for my 4 yo who wants to dance like the ballerinas on the video...and she is a small 4 yo and the bodice is under her breast line. No way it will fit an older kid. They need to revamp this product if they are going to market it. I am disgusted that you put this on shelves. I should have spent the money on a real ballet set for her!
1,tutu made for an infant,"VERY DISSAPOINTED! They should be available in different sizes. And the tutu sticks stright up. My children, especially my 6 yr old was very upset that she could not fit in it. My 3 yr old hardly fits in it well, but wishes to wear it anyway."
1,Not worth it!!!,"I wish my husband had read the reviews before he bought this for our 5 year old. It's too small and the tutu sticks straight up in the air. She still wears it, but it looks ridiculous. For the price, you would think it would fit and lay correctly! She, fortunately, got another ballerina costume from Target made by Xhiliration that DOES fit."
1,Horrible size,"This needs to come in sizes. It's too small for my daughter and I'm not happy. The package says 3-8 years, so it should fit. Don't waste your money."
1,totally small!!!!!!!,"This doesn't even fit my three year old...Beware the dress is probably only appropriate for 2T. It's so small the skirt sticks straight up into my poor daughters armpits, who is totally disappointed.Save your money! Not worth it!"
1,"Doesn't fit at all, Not well made","this tutu sticks straight up in the air, and does not cover my daughter's chest. worst ballet dress i have ever seen, and a total waste of money."
2,Disappointingly small,"My daughter turned four last month and is tall and skinny (40 inches tall, 37 pounds). The top of the outfit falls about an inch below her nipples. Yikes!!! Luckily we had a pink leotard already so she is allowed to wear the tutu with the leotard. The tutu stuck straight up in the back for a day or two, but has since given in to gravity and looks a bit better now. The shoes fit pretty well-- she wears a 9 or 91/2 to give you an idea. They look like they will fit for another year but I doubt the tutu will still fit after a few months once she grows any taller. I agree with the other reviewers... for the price, there should be a huge recall on this."
1,Do Not Waste Your $$$ on Bella Dancerella,"My daughter is 4 yrs. old and received the tutu (sz. 4-6) and the VHS version of the Bella Dancerella Home Ballet Studio from an aunt for Christmas. She was so excited, until we tried on the tutu and it showed the whole front side of her chest and the tutu stuck straight up! Not only that, the VHS tape was completely distorted and you couldn't hear most of it or understand what the girl was saying. This is a horrible product and should be taken off the market!"
1,So disappointing!,We bought this for our granddaughter and she was so diappointed because it didn't fit. It was way too small! Obviously the person who designed it had no idea of children's sizes. The tutu was so small that the skirt part stuck way up under her arms. It should have come in different sizes.
1,Nono would be a better name then tutu,This this is tiny My daugter is 3 and it doesn't fit her lucky I have a 12m old that can use it. The tape to the video for is horrible you can't hear it is all static Don't buy it
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!,"This outfit is terrible. My daughter was so excited when it came in the mail. We immediatley opened it and she put it on. The tutu stood straight up. I cant beleive they would even have this THING on the market. Its terrible! Whats worse, my daughter had to take it off and put it back in the box for a return."
4,I see I'm in the minority!,"My daughter is 3 1/2 and is in the 50th percentile for both her weight and height. The tutu fits her perfect with some room to grow. I figure by the time she no longer fits it, the tutu will be trashed from too much love (as all of her dress-up clothing tends to get.)I'm actually very happy with the tutu. She LOVES it and has been wearing it daily. She's even worn it outside on the swingset, galloped around in the woods with her brother, and attempted to climb the yards chainlink fence wearing it. It still looks great!Yes, the netting does stick up rather abruptly. But we've actually had a good laugh over it because it makes the costume look all the more cute. I imagine over time it will ""calm"" down a bit, lol."
4,GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE CHANGED MY MIND !!!!,"My review was the same as all the other concerning the badly fitting tutu and poor quality VHS video. But then I looked up the manufacturer online and contacted them. Spinmaster replied to me within a day. They said the sizing of the tutu was done in Australia and that it didn't work for the US market. they asked me to send the items back for a replacement of a larger tutu size and a new VHS since the one I had showed bad tracking marks after only 2 viewings. Now, I did have to pay $10 to ship it to Canada but considering; I bought material and tried to alter the tutu myself(which didn't fix it)and I didn't have the receipt to take the items back myself, and that my daughter will be thrilled with the tutu that fits, it was worth the $10."
1,Also very disappointed,"I agree with all the reviews on the small size and poor quality of the tutu. My 4-year old wears a size 4T and is definitely too big for this item which supposedly ""fits size 4-6."" The ""top"" of the tutu hit well below chest level and the skirt stuck straight up in air. My daughter took it right off and said it looked ridiculous. She also complained that the netting was terribly itchy. I will also try to contact the manufacturer but not sure I even want to spend another dime on this one."
2,Tutu too small,"My 3 yr old daughter LOVED her tutu, but it fit weird! She is a peanut, but the tutu exposed her chest, (it is very low cut), and the tutu part stuck straight up in the air, while her tushy was exposed a bit from the bottom. I let her wear it at home, then I packed it away in her memory chest! Cute idea, but the fit needs to be worked on."
1,Cheap Junk and way too small for a 3 1/2 year old,"You have got to be kidding. What junk for the price. My daughter LOVES the Bella Dancerella DVD, so I purchased this set to go along with it so she would look just like the girls on the show. It is not made well at all. The shoulder straps are worthless and it is made for at best a 2 year old size. Unless you child wears a 2T or maybe a 3T it will never fit."
5,A good Story,"I really enjoyed this book. Dr. Newman was a wonderful storyteller and had quite a sense of humor. Sometimes I chuckled out loud, and some parts were sad, even bringing me to tears. Through all the experiences that he wrote about, Dr. Newman came through as the moral, caring doctor that he must have been. All in all a very entertaining book and a tribute to a doctor that had the old fashioned view that the patient came first."
5,Best book of 2003,"This book was enlightening, touching, and funny all at the same time. I could not put it down, as I read the story of Philip Newman's path from the small immigrant apartment in Brooklyn to a lifetime as a beloved and talented physician. Though he desn't talk much about his family life, I could tell that he was an exemplary husband, son, and father from his caring, warmth, straight-talking,and good humor. His apologies about not being there for his children don't ring true. The epilogue by his children brought me to tears, and I could tell that Philip Newman was a one-in-a million wonderful person."
2,Needs a makeover,"This book is out of date. Talks alot about Windows 98, ME and obsolete hardware. Would have been useful around the turn of the century."
1,1 year wonder,I got this printer with my new Gateway system a little over a year ago and it died. Using less than 1 cartridge I would think it would last a little longer. The paper would lock into place and get stuck in that one place. I don't recommend this printer
2,How durable is it?,"I have a Epson Stylus 600. The quality of the print is good, but, the quality of the printer is not. The printer only good for about 800 pages, then the nozzle broke, and the printer does not work any more. So is a friend of mine with his Epson Stylus 870.I would like to doubt the durability of Epson ink jet printers."
3,"Rumbelow""s premises are obsolete in light of current evidenc","Rumbelow did not do his homework completely. If he had done so, he would have discussed the American, Tumbletry, who was the subect of intense investigation by Scotland Yard before he fled back to the U.S. The American papers of 1888 were full of speculation about him, and the Yard followed him here. See more current Ripper titles for details, based on newly-discovered letters from a detective that worked the case."
4,It's a big help to those going to the missions field,As a new missionary I found this book to be very informative and well written. It motivates the reader to think and to prepare for the change is culture that they are about to experience.
2,Jargon filled and depressing in tone,"Do you suffer from lathophobic aphasia? If you are living in a foreign country, be careful. You may be suffering from this disorder. I am reading The Psychology of Missionary Adjustment. It's a sobering book, in which almost all of the case studies that are presented are of real missionaries who were abject failures in their endeavors. This book was overall a disappointment as most of the case studies ended in failure. It was all full of jargon and high-sounding terms that confuse the average reader. Find something else positive about missions before picking up this depressing volume."
1,This CD should have remained only a concept,If you ever have house guest over that you want to leave... just put in this CD. Its a mess.
3,Voyage - not worth the trip,"Competent playing but after a while it all sounds the same. Definitely ""pleasant"" and indistinquishable from most other smooth jazz recordings of this type."
3,Nice coffee table book.,"This isn't a book that you'd just pick up and read by any means. It does have some nice biographical information on Max, but it's so generic and propaganda is it's disgusting.If you're a Peter Max fan and collect his art this book is a must have for you coffee table/book shelf. Has a great selection of his work reproduced nicely for viewing.If you're looking for information about Max, who actually seems to be one of the harder living artists to find FACTUAL information about , this is not the book you're looking for."
5,The People's Artist,"For pop culture collectors - or those old enough - the art of Peter Max may have been initially seen through his picturesque work on school supplies, like pencil boxes and book covers. Max essentially penned the pages of Pop Art as the people's artist by making access a vital concept.The beautiful layout of this intriguing volume is a retrospective on Max's life, though with an emphasis on his more recent - Americana - explorations. There is a special happiness and eternal optimism in Max's artistic endeavors, which makes this collection especially brilliant."
3,5 STAR MUSIC 1 Star Quality CD,"God Did It is an uplifting testimony in song. The lyrics, vocals, and rhythms evoke spiritual renewal with every listen. It is a must have for your gospel music collection. Having initially purchased this in the form of cassette, I sought to purchase it as a CD. The sound quality of three CDs, purchased through different vendors, was poor. I highly recommend God Did It be purchased in the form of cassette."
2,Could have used some more sepll chekcing.,"This is a four page article about computer chess written in 1994. There are spelling errors here and there. The editing could have been better. The price is not so bad for the information that you get, but I will say that much of this info could probably be found elsewhere on the Internet for free. In fact, always search Google for the article to see if it is available elsewhere free of charge: http://www.ddj.com/hpc-high-performance-computing/184405171.Why are we selling this on Amazon?"
5,Excellent for the price,"I bought this book a bit worried about whether it would be any good, based on the reviews here. I was in Williamsburg, and looked at the other costume books available there. This is the least expensive, and therefore does not go into the depths of the much more expensive, larger books. But in itself it is sufficient to give a very good overview of the period. The pictures of original clothes in this book also appear in the other books, along with some others, but the additional pictures do not really add that much to what is in this book, and would cost an additional $55 in cost."
5,Beautiful scent,"I have not seen this fragrance in stores for many, many years. I had a small bottle back in junior high around 1990, and it was always one of my favorite scent. I just received my order from Amazon, and it smells just like I remember from back then, a beautiful fruity floral. I didn't even know this fragrance was still made! I'm a very happy Amazon shopper right now."
5,Yummy,"My wife bought 3 Samba perfumes and this is really a nice smelling perfume, and great value. They shipped fast as well."
5,Can't live without it!!,"This is amazing! I have 3 dogs, a cat, and a baby boy, and this gets out every stain imaginable! It takes out stains, and smells, doesnt just cover them up. I have sprayed a pee spot and put my nose in it the next day and cant smell anything. it's the best."
5,Best stuff I have found!,Have had 2 puppies in the last 3 three years. PUPPIES.... But I found this stuff at Target a few years ago. It is the best I have found. Soak up urine with paper towel and then spray the spot thoroughly. Then I take a damp (water) paper towel and scrub the spot. Usually I do not see or smell it again. Latest puppy got too excited on the couch the other night and let loose. I hit it twice with the above method and we are again sitting on that couch. The trick is to use the Urine Gone first so the enzyme will take affect. My puppies are doing well with potty training but I always have a refill bottle on hand. Thanx to this product my puppies are still alive! JK
5,Best I've found: CLEANS WELL plus deodorizes,"It doesn't just deodorize; we use it to clean the whole floor, including *wide grout lines between tiles. And it barely needs rinsing; maybe not at all, depending on how concentrated you make it."
3,It kinda works...,It worked on old and new stained that had not been treated with any chemicals before. The ones that had actually did clear a little bit but not a whole lot... Good thing is that it is easy to use and it doesn't stink. It's not invasive at all.
1,"Ineffective on Terrazzo, Terrible Customer Service","I normally purchase a different product, sold in my area only at a superstore. Yesterday, in attempt to avoid the drive and hassle of said superstore, I purchased ""urine gone!"" from my local national-chain drug store. The product was completely ineffective on urine stains on my terrazzo floors. The product I normally use removes all traces of stains within seconds. As the ""urine gone!"" product states it has a 30 day money back guarantee, I contacted customer service and was told I could not receive a refund because I purchased the product at a store. The store, of course, states I can not receive a refund because the manufacturer offers a refund. In my conversation with the customer service rep. I stated I wished to be sure I was accurately quoting her so that when I placed my review on the Internet it would factual. She responded, ""You can't review our product on the Internet!"". - Sorry, just did."
1,Urine gone....NOT!,"I purchased this item due to having a cat that was tempermental and liked to pee on anything that was on the floor. Living in an apartment and being faced with having to pay for the cost of repairing the carpet yet again, I thought I would try out ""Urine Gone"". Big mistake. Complete waste of money. After treating everything that came up under the black light (some stains were treated upwards of 3+ times to make sure they were removed), we lifted the carpet to inspect the pad. Urine still remained in the pad, untouched by the Urine Gone. I will NEVER use the product again and do not recommend wasting any money on it."
5,Urine Gone Review,This is an amazing product. I clean houses for a living and a couple of them are multiple pet owners. To be more specific mutiple cat owners. Even though the animals are all spayed or neutered and the cat boxes are cleaned twice daily when you get 5 cats in a house I can guarantee you that there will be a need for this product. It eliminates the smell of urine instantly. It of course has a smell of its own but it is not an over powering scent and it doesn't linger for that long. This is the best product of its type that I have ever come across and will continue to use it as long as it is being made. *TWO THUMBS UP*
1,What a SCAM,This product does not work at all. Yes the black light was the only thing worth buying to see other stains on dark carpet. But applying the solution three times back to back it didnt do not a thing but get me upset after waiting to air dry. I am glad I bought this product at under market value in a department store for only $8.. although I should have stuck to my guns of never believing SEEN AS ON TV!!ERRR
4,Kennedy's Opinions!,"Someone should read this book because it is exciting and a fun adventure. Someone should not read this book if they don't like adventures and excitement in a story.This book was a pretty good book that is why I rated it a 4.It was not an awesome book because it got boring and I wanted to put it down at times, but I did not because I was determined to get done and finish the book so I kept on reading. If you are a reader who likes action and people who die then you should read this book. My favorite part was when Annie went in to battle being brave. My favorite character was Annie because she was so brave and determined."
4,A educational book,"I'm reading this book in my class for lit. circles and so far I think it is good.The part I don't like about it is that it is bloody.But, Annie is really interesting and determined to be a good nurse.She is very brave!There are some sad parts, though.Good for 4th grade and up."
5,Liked it,"Writing wasn't bad, I expected more from the better known actors of the time. The strongest performer was Josh Morrow, this was early in his acting career, as he is known for his role as Nick Newman On ""The Young & the Restless""."
3,Worth It If You Are a Fan of Miss Ward,"I just bought this movie. Ever since getting my fill of Rachel in the Thorn Birds, I thought that I would check out most of her other movies. I have seen four thus far. I also like Josh Morrow as eye candy, and he does well with her, even though she is old enough to be his mother. The acting ability here is not the same as her ability in a feature film, but one has to remember that this was a made-for-TV movie. If you are expecting ""Meggie-esque"" performances, you may be let down. But the same passion for the part and the role are there, so if you are looking for a great performance from Rachel, you will be in luck."
2,meh!!,FLUFF and this guys a buzz kill if you need a dream crushing book with a lot of fluff this is your book... I would pass on this do not buy this
1,PURE Polytheism,"This book is about the""Relational Trinity"" an old blatantly polytheistic version of the Trinity. It is getting more popular recently due to God and the Gospel becoming for some more humanistic."
5,"COOL, SMOOTH & SENSUOUS","I first saw Chris Botti in Sting's ""Brand New Day Tour-Live At The Universal Amphitheater"" DVD. He substituted the role which used to be played by Branford Marsalis, only this time in his cool, smooth & sensuous trumpet. I used to favor the saxophone as the better horn instrument as compared to the trumpet but Chris Botti made me appreciate the trumpet by the way he plays. ""Midnight..."" is my second Chris Botti CD (the first one being ""Slowing Down The World"". He has never failed me thus far."
4,Mr. Mood,"Chris Botti's ""Midnight Without You"" is an elegant moody set that wears well since its 1997 release. ""Regroovable"" with its perky beat and Botti's insistently cheerful horn sliding over Shawn Pelton's drums is the most instantly accessible. ""Until Now"" also offers a similar midtempo setting, albeit a bit more in moody territory that offers a pretty Botti melody and keyboard atmospherics. The opener ""The Steps of Positano"" is dark & moody with a lovely melody. Jonatha Brooke's vocals on ""Forgiven"" also shimmer and interplay wonderfully with Botti's trumpet, ""These are the chances we take, the reasons that we can't explain, follow your heart everyday & pray to be forgiven."" ""Midnight Without You"" is a consistently satisfying set from this excellent master of the trumpet and mood. Enjoy!"
2,Why? Why?,"I was so excited about this game when I heard about. But when I saw the cover I noticed a weird looking guy on the cover. I said ""That's not Hot Shots Golf 2!"" I saw the game and I saw people playing it. I thought (that looks fun) then I also noticed the characters again!I thoght it was a Pirated version of Hot Shots Golf 2.But yesterday I found out that SCEA changed the characters for the American Release! Like they changed Sam to an weird looking guy from a cool guy from the first one. I knew wanted to find the Japanese verison to buy but it was know where not even Japan!I DO NOT recommend the American version but that is if you can find the Japanese one.(P.S. I hope they don't make the same mistake changing the Characters again in Hot Shots golf 3 for PS2)"
3,Good except graphics,"Pretty accurate, only complaint is the graphics and the sound is a little annoying.altogether the game is easy to understand and enjoyable."
3,A wonderful suprise......,"I'm really not sure how I came across the name Syleena Johnson, but thanks to Amazon, my search finally ended. A very, very suprising underground talent with a amazingly power voice. The low budget CD cover doesn't deserve to house such a great voice. Better production on this CD, could have made this a 5 star joint."
3,Doesn't really show her potential,"I didn't know that Syleena made an album before Chapter One..., but I heard it the other day. The daughter of blues musician Syl Johnson shows a little promise on this supposed debut, but weak lyrics and average production damper this project. That, and I'm not down with her freestyle on ""Please Don't Stop"". The standout tracks are ""Can't Get Over You"" and ""You're Not the Man"" (not the Sade song), but even those tracks only show a snippet of what this woman can do vocally. Walk to get this album, but run to get Chapter One..."
5,Thanking The Seller,"Ordering this CD was very easy, and i want to thank the Seller whom I bought this item from. I have been looking for this CD every where and no one seems to have it or know of it....so I thank Amazon.com once again for coming through for me...Syleena is very sultry and fantastic with her music. I love everything about her music....Thank You SellerThank You Amazon.comThank You Syleena"
5,Here Either,"No regrets for buying this magnificent bit of Redbonism! Redbone came out of the gate with a magnificent adaptation of old-time swing/ragtime. Covering the old monsters better that they did it themselves. Here we get to hear Leon vastly improving an Elvis hit, ""Lonesome Tonight"", which I was never really that impressive to me, until now. I'm an old rock fan, grew up with the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Black Sabbath came onto the scene (Indeed and thank you Zeus!), Soundgarden and Alice in Chains brought hard rock into the non-ostentatious, cerebral magnifying realm, yet as hesitant as I am to admit this... Oh Hell.... I like Leon Redbone better than any! Talk about unique character. If you buy this and have ""Regrets"", never admit it as you'll be seen a fool. No, it's NOT hard rock! Yes, it is DAMN good!"
4,Different strokes for Leon Redbone/Steve Martin,"Steve Martin singing as his alter-ego Leon Redbone chooses a somewhat different style for this set of classic songs. Overall, it's not quite as funky, though his repeat rendition of Lazy Bones is nice."
3,Good Toy For the money,"The lord of the rings was a great movie. Probably one of the best scenes was the battle in moria where the fellowship fought a giant cave troll along with thousands of orcs. for the money, this troll is pretty good. it's arms move and swings it's club with the push of a button. face comes off easily though. still pretty good.I play with it along with all of my other characters from the first movie"
5,Fits the Need 100%,These work perectly for hanging something on cube walls that's too heavy for the pin hangers that stick in the fabric.
5,INSIDE BOUND FOR GLORY,"This film is an intimate veiw of dust bowl Americana, and the life of a folk music Icon.The best performance to date from David Carradine. A visual jewel,filmed in California's San Joaquin Valley,by cinematographer Haskel Wexler. First film to use the Steadycam,(floating camera mount). Incredible dust bowl scene created with effects. The music reflects the mind of a man who see's the struggles of the people and the freedom of the soul through his music. Look for Mary Kay Place in her first movie role. Also, first film for Randy Quiad. A real handcrafted film. I shoud know,I was Carradines' stand-in."
4,Bound for Glory great for those with interest in Woody Guthrie & Folk Music & Great Depression/Dust Bowl,"The movie is kind of slow-moving - definitely a character, time & place study. It features excellent cinematography & good acting - especially by David Carradine playing Guthrie. I learned a great deal more about the Oklahoma dust bowl, how the hobos who rode the rails were treated, and about how some folks managed to eke out a living during the Depression. The movie highlights one of the several unpleasant episodes in California history - portraying the injustices against depression-era migrant workers that Woody Guthries speared in his music, and wrote of in his autobiography. Unfortunately, some of these injustices, now targeted at immigrant workers from Mexico & Central America, persist to this day."
1,Fictionalized history of Woody,"Since I already knew something about Woody Guthrey's story I was very disappointed by how far this wandered from the truth of his life story, they fabricated some parts, changed the context of facts and totally ignored his later life, including his battle with Huntington's disease. If you want to watch a slow moving too long remake of the Grapes of Wrath then you'll like this movie, but if you want to learn the much more interesting true history get American Masters: Woody Guthrie: Ain't Got No Home, A Vision Shared: A Tribute to Woody Guthrie and Leadbelly or Woody Guthrie: This Machine Kills Fascists"
4,[Really three-and-a-half out of Four] David Carradine's best all around acting performance!,"Basically, it's about depression era singer-poet-songwriter Woody Guthrie's travels aro-nd the USA to help bering attention to theWPAs ['We Piddle Around']/ New (Socialist)Deal crowds' ignoring of the working man'sproblems. Putting Guthrie into the properHistorical perspective, he was Will Rogers+ Father Charles Coughlin v. the tyranicalMasonic FDR Administration's follies thatlead this country into W.W.II, unnecessar-ily! Carradine and the emsamble cast, part-icularly Ronnie Cox, are outstanding!"
3,Bound for Mediocrity,"While the casting and acting are great I had serious problems with the music and story. The music is out of sequence, giving you a false impression of when the songs were written. And the story is just plain inaccurate, mixing time and place. So if you know anything about Woody Guthrie's life you will be sorely disappointed. On the other hand, if you just want a sense of who he was, at least up until about 1940, go for it!"
2,Not the Full Picture...,"""This movie cleans-up Woody's personal life and his many binges and focuses primarily on his union organizing. Unlike Woody's autobiographicalbook,Bound for Glory, it did not deal with the struggles he endured from his mother's mental illness, nor his own. The photography was good, the sound was a little off, but most importantly, the film doesn't capture the complexity of Woody Guthrie."
4,"A film I appreciate and admire, although I don't quite love","This portrait of Woody Guthrie has a lot of highlights, includingHaskell Wexler's great photography).But David Carradine is very good, not great in the lead, and the filmfeels a bit unfocused.There's surprisingly little of Guthrie's music performed, and a lot ofit played orchestrally as soundtrack, which seemed odd and out ofcharacter to me.I appreciate that this is grittier, darker, and less linear than thestandard Hollywood bio-pic. And I love that Guthrie is shown as adeeply flawed man, (e.g. his easy willingness to cheat on his wife).But in the end this doesn't go very deeply into his politics or hismusic, the two most important things about his life.Not helped by the fact the DVD transfer is pretty awful quality."
4,More of an impression of the dust bowl times,"As others have pointed out, this movie is loose about facts and short on music, so a familiarity with Guthrie would help. However, it does evoke the plight of the downtrodden during this time, which influenced Woody's world view.It is eerie that I found this item brand new at an exchange shop, only to find out the day after that it had been his 100th birthday.On a technical note, two different DVD players had trouble with pixillation at different points in this long movie, so the compression may be a problem for others on this pre dual-layer disc."
3,not good and not bad,"it is only a fair knife, not very good and not very bad. actually it is very sharp. it is made in china but amazon didn't indicate that though made in china doesn't mean low qulity."
3,This is the world of Dr. Dolittle! (3.5 stars),"This is a pleasant musical score. Rex Harrison employs his sing-speak style with ease and Anthony Newly contributes his enthusiastic (if slightly hammy) vocals. And unlike some musicals of this era, the movie is actually good. Not the finest musical soundtrack out there but good nonetheless.Darkhorse86"
1,I give this purchase a 1 out of 10,"I am very unhappy with my purchase. I bought Deadly Matrimony and was so excited to get it, once i popped it into the VCR it was jumping, the sound was up and down and half the time you coulnt even see the picture because of all of the lines going through the screen. We tried to track it with absolutely no luck. I fast forwarded and then rewound thinking that the tape might just be loose and we didnt have any luck. It is pointless to even try to watch the movie because it is such a disapointment."
4,A good film,"This is a good movie about a brave cop. Brian Dennehy is terrific. And I think that the movie is fair to Alan Masters -- after all, he was convicted, along with two others. The stories in the movie are also in a couple of books about the case!"
3,decent film....wish that it was more widely watched...,"It's sad that films such ""Shattered Promises""are not more widely watched...its interesting and fast paced ...decent performances..yes,it suffers,as one can see,due to the tv format as it was made for television[that's what i'm told]..all the same,if one can get a copy of the film it should be watched....watch it if u can ...u won't regret it"
5,Difficult to put books by McKay down. Such great writing.,"I got this and the other western society book by McKay from a thrift store for a few dollars and have been mesmerized by both. The authors make history a fun topic and easy to understand. I find these books even better written that the highly revered book by Spielvogel.I assume the target audience for these books are high school and early college students, so the topics are treated too concisely but just enough to give one a good flavor so if needed, one can look up more sources online."
5,On time like said,The book came in good cond.and on time!... Do business anytime..referred them to other classmates
5,Life of an Army wife,"I purchased this book to give me some background of what life was like for army wives stationed out West and in this particularcase, Fort Phil Kearny. The author was the wife of Lt. Grummond that was killed in the Fetterman massacre and she speaks at lengthabout her arrival at the Fort, the times leading up to the massacre and what happened after.I was able to glean a lot of information about the happenings at the Fort as well as what travel was like for the women whoaccompanied their husbands to the isolated garrisons. Especially interesting is the discussion of winter travel.All in all, a good book that gives the reader a general idea of what life was like at an isolated army post. There is other materialcovering her trip from the East as well as extensive material about the events that came much later - after she left the post."
2,Doesn't look good,"Although this top is okay, the matching skirt is awful. I can't use it and want to send it back. Thank you for your concern. How do I return this stuff?"
4,The Tool Maid,Nice product made a little cheap but works great once I figured out the best way to put my tools in there I have 20 garden tools plus my weedwacker.
4,Neat Product,"THe only thing i had issue with was that one of the casters did not go in as deep as i woud like. Other than that, set-up was a snap. The casters work fine and i was able to put all of my tools on it without any problems. I really like the fact that you have different size holes. I wish i had a few more of the larger ones to fit tools with a rubber grip."
4,Deluxe Tool Tower,Great addition for the garage for storage of all those long-handled gardening tools. Perfect location is the corner of the garage since it does not take much space and there is still plenty of room left over to park your car.
5,Great Product,This storage unit is everything it says it is and more. For once my garage is organized. I used to waste so much wall space with all my yard equipment. You can't go wrong in getting this product. No brainer.
4,Tool guy,"I bought this product for a garden shed to organize yard tools, such as rakes, hoes, ect. I was very pleased with it. It snaps together easily. Its tough and durable. And works quite well to organize and keep all your garden tools in one spot. Your long handeled tools mount along the front, and there are places for you hand tools in the middle. I would recommend it. Good organizer."
4,Good product; but a bit under designed,"This tool rack is great, and has helped me de-clutter my garage. The problem I see is that it holds too many tools for the plastic frame and casters to support. Trying to move it around becomes a challenge, as it has become top-heavy. The plastic frame is not rigid enough to hold its shape when rolling it around. I am going to buy a second rack and spread out the load. Overall, I am happy with the product."
3,Not quite what I was hoping for.,"My Rubbermaid Tool Tower came in on time, and as advertised, was very easy to assemble. However, it is way to lightweight to fully load down with tools. If you try to store a few rakes and shovels on it, it will hold them properly, but if you try to load it up, or if you try to move it with even a few tools stored on it, it becomes very unstable. I thought the whole point of having casters on the bottom was to be able to move it around with tools on it! This rack is probably great for brooms and lightweight rakes, but I would recommend you go with something sturdier for rakes, hoes, and shovels."
2,Poor Quality Wheels - Broke immediately,"This is a good idea... except for the very poor quality casters, one of which would never stay on. I ended up throwing this entire thing out after trying to use it for over a year, out of frustration. Then I found that my shovels, etc. take up much less space by lying down on a shelf!"
3,rubbermaid tool tower,This does hold quite a bit of tools. More than I thought it would in fact. It is a little flimsy though. Be sure to put the wheels on last. I almost broke mine pushing it together with the wheels on. It works great if you are going to leave it in one place & maybe move it once in a while. Certainly not for you if you intend to use it as a cart to push your tools around in.
4,Great Value But Could Be Improved,The tool tower assembled in a jiffy and within 10 minutes I had a my yard tools off the garage floor and neatly organized. Great value but I do not dare move the thing. The plastic support rods would be better served if changed to rigid metal that lock into place. The casters do not roll well and pulling on the top shelf will cause it to pop off the support legs or cause the tools to shift around. The casters are only good for maybe moving the thing a few feet from the garage wall to sweep behind it. All in all it does the job for static storage and is a good value. All the upgrades to improve it would just add cost.
3,Rubbermaid 5E2800 Deluxe Tool Tower with Casters,"Tool tower works well for holding tools if you do not plan on moving it - Do not expect something that is able to take a bump or a shove and not break, as it is plastic - the coaster idea is lame as the post mounts for the casters are weak and not formed properly to hold much weight, mine broke. Otherwise, the item is useable to organize a corner - it does save on space."
1,Cheap - You get what you pay for,Warped under the weight of my yard tools. Cheap thin plastic. Very disappointing as it did receive many favorable reviews.
5,great product,Holds all the lawn stuff and seems sturdy enough. I like the shelf on the bottom and the fact that you can roll the whole works out to the lawn.
3,mickeyB,I like things neat in my garage and this tool rack helps. Easy to get to the tools I need and keeps the tools from falling down.
5,Great product,I really like this organizer. It fits everything in such an orderly manner and was priced right. It arrived in perfect condition.
4,great garage organizer,"This organizer is great for that big mess in the corner of the garage of long handledyard tools, snow shovels, string trimmer, and brooms. This messy spot has always beena problem and now it looks great and the longer narrow design of the cart makes it fiteasily along the wall and not take up car space. The wheels are pretty much useless ifthe cart is loaded but all in all a great product that I would recommend."
4,"Decent rack, although a bit flimsy","This rack was $10 cheaper than the one made by Suncast, so I bought it. It's okay. A bit flimsy, though. When I roll it, it tends to shake a bit. Must be careful when lifting the assembled rack: the peaces can separate quite easily. Still, not too bad, although I wish it were sturdier. The wheels have locks to keep it in place."
4,Super solution to storing tools,"We got this just before moving to consolidate lots of tools from wall racks to something we could handle at a house with no garage (yet). It was so easy to assemble I did it in the kitchen and it took only about five minutes. It took longer figuring out where to put everything than it did to put it together.It is very stable and the wheels make it very easy to move around. Basically, we stuck everything with a long handle in it and still have holes left over. The only knock I have on the unit is that there is no positive locations for the ends of the tools on the base so many of them flop around a bit making it somewhat harder to keep things organized. But even that is nothing compared to having all these tools handy and tangle free.I looked at several other similar units and Rubbermaid's is much stronger and more stable. A good deal for the money. I highly recommend it for anyone trying to corral a number of yard tools in a small place."
2,NOT for real hand tools,"Wheels collapsed when I populated with shovels and other metal hand tools. The plastic wheels have weak supports that split when you roll the unit on first use. System works fine once placed in the corner and stays in place. I did not give lowest rating since it unit was inexpensive and serves primary purpose. In additionn, it may work OK for grass rakes and brooms."
2,Great at first. Bends and bows over time. Not sturdy.,"When I first bought this it appeared to be a great, portable tool storage unit. It might have stayed that way had I only stored light-weight yard tools on it, but with the weight of shovels, edgers and an ax or two, it has bowed and swayed to the point where it is unstable unless it is propped up against something. Reinforced steel rods in the legs and base would go along way to improving this unit. Would not recommend buying for storing anything heavy."
3,Rubbermaid 5E28 Deluxe Tool Tower Rack,"This tool rack was very simple to assemble but I find it not very sturdy. I use it without the wheels in my garage and it seems a bit shaky when you insert or remove tools. It does the job but I guess for the price, I shouldn't expect much more."
4,Good Product.,"This rack is holding ALL of my shovels, brooms, rakes, and other garden tools with ease! I love that my tools are organized. The casters make the whole thing moveable which is nice for cleaning. It assembles easily in less than 10 minutes. I recommend it."
4,Functional But Insecure,"I purchased 2 of these for my landscaping business to try to organize tools that get used often but not everyday. It holds a lot, but is top heavy. If it had a wider base or could be fastened down it would be great. I think it would be fine for a homeowner to use for a few miscellaneous tools."
5,Saves space!,"Great product - really reduces the clutter of all my yard tools etc... and saves a lot of space. I have 11-12 foot ceilings in my garage so it is easy to get things in and out. If you have lower ceilings, you may have to wheel it out of the garage first to get items in and out."
3,Missing parts,Every thing was as discribed except the casters were missing. Return was no problem. Just had to print shipping label and take it to my local UPS. No problems. i have since reordered the same produc = LOVE IT!
5,"Finally, a normal bedtime!","We love this product! Our 4 year old was; to say the least, a difficult child to get to bed. She knew all the excuses and every night turned into a hassle just to get her to sleep. Then we were given Pillywinks as a gift.Bedtime now consists of reading one book (instead of 10) and fun activities that seem to use up that excess bedtime energy children seem to have. She sleeps with all the pillows and now the only problem we are having is getting her to let her little brother sleep with one. Maybe a Pillywink version regarding sharing would be good?"
5,PURE ART,"Nobody will ever understand Polanskis real taste. Unless someone goes through the things he did do not even try. Every film of his shows the reality of our pathetic but wonderful life. Bitter moon is one of his best. The strange couple and the so called normal couple meet and change eachothers life forever. The question is which one of them is normal. Hugh Grant and Kristin Scott Thomas? The tipical couple with no phantasy but no brutality or mania, OR Peter Coyette and mrs. Polanski? The strangest couple jumped out of Roman's mind? Everyone can deside! There's no correct answer, I can tell you that."
2,Disappointed,"If you like this type of film,-you will probably give it 4 or 5 stars. I don't. I bought this video mainly because Vangelis did the music and I am a Vangelis fan and collector. There was practically no music by Vangelis in the film. So I give the film 1 star for the actors and 1 star for the very small amount of Vangelis music. I was disappointed."
1,Long and Boring,"I find that the film was very long because it did not depict anything new as the story enfolded. A relationship between two people who are so engrossed in each other for superficial reasons is bound to fail. What is boring is that the only thing they had interest in was sex. The script does not instruct the audience about what two people who are in love can do to further their relationship. It does not depict interesting situations like manipulation or control or playing hard to get, etc. It does depict how cruel one partner can be to another. Moreover, why a victim in a relationship would not want to leave and find someone else is unrealistic. A dog or cat would be a better companion than Peter Coyote's character. I find the revelation of the failed relationship uninteresting and the sexual obsession shallow. I would not find it entertaining to ever see this film again."
5,no title,"Absolutely most intense, emotionally, movie I've seen in a long time. Peter Coyote here is fabulous. The woman in this movie is Polanski's wife. It was one terrific flic. Very sexually explicit. This movie just pulls out all stops, hitting every emotional button on the way. Never figured out exactly where it was going. Film essentially about two people who love each other intensely - then it turns to hate, but they can never let go. Ending took a real surprise turn. Kind've sad, as it points out, that for a couple to last, there must be more than sexual fire. There should be respect, companionship, and friendship. Sex can never be all. And Polanski also shows that love and hate are very close. You do not care to hurt someone you are indifferent to."
4,Be happy with what you have...,"I don't know why, but I am mesmerized by this movie... The story drwas you in, although shocking at times and incredibly cruel. The moral of the whole thing is twofold: the grass is always greener and the more you dig, the dirtier it gets."
2,eh...,"OK, so I'm not a Polanski aficianado. This is a long movie, but at times feels like an eternity. Superb casting, but the story? Eh...I couldn't care less."
3,"Evenhanded, but little on real clones (identical twins)","The author of this book is mostly evenhanded; she clearly describes almost all the points of view about human cloning, no matter how profound or silly. However, she almost completely ignores the consensus viewpoint of most identical twins, triplets, and quads.Identicals are a significant minority population, real human clones who view the entire cloning debate as silliness at best and bias against identicals at worst. Some societies used to kill identicals at birth, viewing them as evil!No book about cloning is complete without serious consideration of living identicals.Gary Noyes"
3,Special effects needed some Progress,"This film was fairly well made. However, as far as the special effects and make up go, there was something lacking. If you are accustomed to big budget films you will be able to detect where the real set ends and the CG (computer graphics) starts. Also there was the make up issue, although Apollyon's face was well made up, horns and all... his hands did not have a scrap of make up on them. This was a distraction since it was obvious that it was a guy with a costume and only facial make up. This is the kind of thing that you would expect in a school play.The film has a great musical score and catches the essence of the book. However the lines and the characters were structured in such a naive way that you could easily guess the next step for the character.In order for these films to get a wider audience and the respect of movie critics, they need to pay greater attention to the details, so they can get away from the 'cheap christian film' stigma."
2,Pilgrims Progress,Not bad - followed the book pretty well but not as well done as I was led to believe. A good rental - would not hold small children's attention.
3,Salvation Not made clear enough,"IT SEEMED TO MUDDY THE WATERS ABOUT HOW TO BE SAVED, I DID NOT THINK IT MADE IT CLEAR ENOUGH."
5,Awesome!,"This is an amazing movie! A recent re-make of the 1950's version of the 17th century account of one man's biblical interpretation of the Christian earthly journey to eternal life in heaven. It is biblically accurate regarding what the bible (both old and new Testament) teaches about the faith necessary to complete life's journey and the things that derail and snare us along the way. It is replete with sound effects and visual gymnastics that give the viewer a panoramic view of bible themes and depictions (e.g., ""the valley of the shadow of death""). I encourage families to watch this movie together. I've shared it at least 10 times with neighbors, family, and friends; encouraging them to take the DVD and share it with someone else, I simply order another. It is that important to share the story of redemption, especially to those who have doubts about the reality and soverignty of God. There is a companion bible study book avaialable also."
3,Not as good as the '79 version,"Even with the updated technology, I didn't like this version as well as the 1979 version. I thought the scene where christian has his burdens lifted was much more moving in the older version. In this one it's almost forgettable and in the older it was probably the most moving scene. It's good but I prefer the older, possibly ""cheesier"" version by far."
4,Love this story.,I read this in school ..what year I don;t remember. I bought a version for my youngest daughter when she was about twelve. I was really excited about this film but it did not live up to my expectations. This story calls for lots of special effects that just were not there.. Too bad..an opportunity lost.
4,Pilgrim's progress,"A biblically sound movie that shows in the form of allegory what Christian salvation means.Christian, the main character, has a spiritual experience represented by a journey in a forest.During his journey, he meets some friends and some enemies. Christian's friends symbolize Christian quolities i.e. hope and fearlessness, while Christian's enemies represent the typical sins i.e. vanity.The movie also presents the obstacles and tribulations that Christians have to endure in every day life.Bad special effects, good story."
1,depends what you like...,"i don't want to be critical about this as in saying the movie was stupid, but it just felt like it got a bunch of people form church to make this movie. i understand a modern version of the film, but i believe if it had a budget it could have looked like Lord of the Rings or at very least Naria or Amazing Grace. The effects were like made for Christian TV. It felt like the movie was trying to be Christian rather than just being what it should have been. I don't think the movie was worth watching unless you love movie made for TV, then go right ahead and enjoy. As I said, if it had a budget it could have been great depending on the director. Amazing Grace and Naria did have an anointing on parts of them. The best part about that is, the directors weren't even Christians at all. Now that's God moving and doing what He wants."
1,Boring,"Woe, this will put you to sleep. It did me within about 5 minutes. If you happen to have trouble sleeping, get this movie. It's guaranteed to help."
1,Pilgrim's Progress: Journey to Heaven,"Did not read the book. Movie may be ok for just a movie. But, as a Christian movie I give it 2 thumbs down. The movie does not line up with Bible scripture. It missed the mark when it comes to the Journey to Heaven. Can not understand how John Hagee or Johnathan Flawell can indorse such a movie."
1,Disk failure,"At about 1:37:00, the video became very smeared and the ""frames"" began to jump around, The DVD was restarted from the beginning several times and on different DVD prayers!! Need-less-to say I am must displeased with the DVD and would like a working replacement!!Walter Weeks"
4,Enjoyable Experience!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. As I child I read the book, and I believe the movie remained faithful to the literary account. It emphasized two important things to me. First of all, there is forgiveness in Christ. Second of all, the Christian life is a journey."
5,Wonderful movie,"This is a wonderful movie that very accurately describes the true walk of a Christian through this world on his/her journey to heaven. Did a great job of capsulizing the book's events and message into a movie, keeping true to the Gospel, and keeping the viewer engaged. We stayed glued to the screen, and you can't help but watch this one over again! Great discipling tool, to help believers count the cost and stay in the faith. One of my favorite Christian movies alongside Luther and the Gospel of John."
2,Very disappointing attempt on a classic!!,"The portrayal of this very worthy and well-known classic story is sadly weak. The idea to start it out in a modern setting was perhaps its strongest point. Appolyon is a person dressed in black with a white mask who is neither scary nor dangerous. He makes a person laugh. Why don't film makers do something serious? Appolyon should have looked and sounded like the Balrog in ""Lord of the Rings."" The armor that Christian is given is a bit of ridiculous plastic. ""Prince Caspian,"" is authentic because he wears real armor. For interesting illustrations for this classic, I would suggest, ""Dangerous Journey,"" William B. Eerdmans, Grand Rapids, Michigan. I would not suggest purchasing this version of ""Pilgrim's Progress."" This version is a real shame and perhaps could even discredit this allegory of Christian conversion and progression until reaching heaven."
1,VERY BAD ACTING !!,"I tried to sit through this, but the acting was terrible. The main character Christian was not too bad, but the others were just terrible. The whole movie was confusing.. I like Christian movies, but this I just couldnt finish. The special effects werent too bad, and the actual quality of shooting was pretty good, but I cant watch a movie with such bad actor's in it."
1,This film lacks progress,Pilgrims Progress - Journey to Heaven was a disappointment. I tried to give this movie the benefit of a doubt knowing how difficult it would be to make John Bunyon's story into a movie. But the quality was very low and the acting was terrible. I never finished watching the movie to the end.
3,The Holy Mountain,"This film was beautifully restored. One wouldn't imagine it's age by just watching it. One of the ""end-of-era"" silent films, technically impressive, and starring a woman who out-lived all her enemies, and remains one of the great film makers of the 20th century. Made long before special effects became merely technical matters, the mountain climbers in this film were the real thing, and the risk-taking boggles one's mind. Cujones for sure!"
5,Amazing music,Although not his newest music this should be a mainstay for anyone wholoves jazz. I figure I will be wearing this cd out from so much play.Amazing music.
2,Slow and unreliable,"I have had this printer for almost four years now, and while it has saved my bacon on the road a number of times, it has also really let me down at some crucial moments. First, like a lot of older Canon printers, it is noisy and slow. It takes forever to get started on a page. But also like a lot of canons, when it is working right the output is beautiful.But you cannot count on finding ink cartridges for this printer on the road. It also has a weird and unpleasant ink cartridge system which includes two very different little trays, and three different kinds of tank.But what made me finally leave the thing in a hotel room was its tendency to get halfway through a print job and jam or inexplicably give an error signal. I have spent hours trying to get a clean copy of a single transparency. Very frustrating."
1,Road warriors beware!,"Another piece of junk disguised as a portable printer! (Read my review of the HP 350 portable.) On this unit, the paper feed mechanism failed after 3 months -- repaired under warranty. Last week it stopped putting ink down at my client's facility (really embarrassing). It spite of ""5 deep cleanings,"" a new catridge, and 5 more deep cleanings the printer would only print blank pages.I was then forced to go out a buy HP's new portable - the 450 (I'm keeping my fingers crossed) so I could continue working."
1,Printer did not work.,I received the Bjc-85 portable printer. I have plugged it into many electrical outletts in my home and office. The item will not turn on . I was sold a broken printer. I am very unhappy with this product.
1,Poor output and very slow.,"I really wonder why people rave at this printer. It's terribly slow and the color output is truly awful. In addition if you don't use the printer every day the ink drys up in no time although this is not too much to worry about because after 3 pages you probably have run out if ink anyway.I suppose if you want a portable printer it's ok, but otherwise forget it."
2,A real pain to get it to work,"I purchased two of these on Ebay just to get one complete working unit. I can't say I'm too pleased with it. It's noisy and does an awful lot of clicking and clacking to start, print a page, or shut down. The error light seems to come on too often, and figuring out what's wrong with it is a real challenge. The cartridge replacement is a hassle and if you're not fast enough the cartridge returns to its home position and won't come back out. The combination of buttons you need to push to get it out again is ridiculous (e.g., one of the steps involves pushing the cartridge button 16 times! No kidding!) The battery dies in a few days even if the printer is turned off; I guess there's some power consumption even when it's off. Besides, it's about twice the size and weight of the BJC-50. Let's just say, I'm still looking for a solution to my portable printing needs."
4,Great little Printer but ....,I just got one it is so small and perfect for fitting in the same laptop bag USB and decent resolution ... but it needs power cord : ( and it says optional battery pack but it is unheard of I think .. ? Anyone know where to get that and it would be great Infra red printing and optional scanner card are great too ..
5,Fun and challenging,This game is one you will either love or hate! The challenge is the ability to visualize moves. This may include moving more than one piece to achieve your goal. Then you have to remember what those moves were in your mind if your number of moves are fewer than the others playing. Be prepared to think when playing this game!
5,Great Competitive puzzle game,Ricochet Robots is more of a competitive puzzle game than a true board game. Each person can compete to find the lowest number of moves to get the robot to the target. As a competition it can be a bit strife-inducing but it is a quality game. Endless fun and never runs out of new puzzles.
1,review,i have a lot of music from the messianic group lamb so i was surprised that i didn' t really like this one very much.
3,As advertised,This was a used case and it arrived in the condition expected for a used item- a little bit dirty and in need of some spiffing up but overall in good shape. No tears or anything. It holds the Game Boy Advace console and about 6 games which I like because the game cartidges are small and could easily become lost among my son's other stuff.
3,Mehhh... So-So,"This bag isnt very big, ive seen it in stores! i have seen way bigger bags that Hold Every thing! Gba, AND Gbc and 20 games and in struction books, wormlights cables batteries, battery Paks and still have room for more!!!!!!"
1,too small,when i first bought my gba i figured it would be a good idea to buy a case to hold all my stuff so i bought this one. At first it was great. Of course i only had two games and the gba. then i bought more stuff and now i can barely fit anything in so i have to buy a bigger case to hold all my stuff. ye its convinient to have a separate compartment for the gba but the other part is just way too small and there isn't nearly enough space to hold all my stuff. if u only want to be able to hold about four games this would be a great case for u but ...there just isn't enough room for all my stuff. i don't recomend at all!!!!
4,"Pretty good, and a great price!","This isn't so bad, it'll fit you're GameBoy Advance in it (duh!) as well as 15 game packs/cartridges, an AC adapter and Sharklight. It's kinda big, and a bit heavy, so you might be better off buying a Game Boy Advance holster, but it's just an oppinion."
1,Terrible Quality!,"I rented it to watch on my laptop and I could only get 15min in because it kept buffering and freezing. I've never had this problem, my connections were good and I'd rented other films that day so I think it was just this title."
3,This book...,"This book was not really what i was hoping it would be, it seems to mainly cover the details for running a game centering around the denizens. Its an alright product if you are looking to follow the end of times storyline that white wolf did, but i was hoping more for a product on chimera and areas of the dreaming for a earlier storyline, i dont really do the whole time of reckoning stuff."
4,"As usual, a fine novel by Wilbur Smity","A saga describing the social structure of South Africa before the end of apartheid. Vivid character descriptions, with plenty of suspense and action kept the plot moving, which was great for such a long book. Enough material for two or three books! One of my favorite authors."
4,Mini gem microscope,"Haven't used it yet as it just arrived but I have looked at it and I think I'm going to love it. So small it will easily fit in a small purse, with light and soft carrying case. Can't wait to try it!"
4,"Awesome, the series continues","each time i pick up a novel in the courtney saga, i cannot wait for the next one. smith is awesome and now i want to visit south africa...."
5,valuable resource,"As a guidance counselor, I am always interested in obtaining good resources to use and share with others. I have recommended this book to parents and teachers. It has a wealth of information about ADHD teens."
5,Very good book,"Very good informational book to comprehend & teach students with ADHD. Although, I just started this book,I am very satisfied as to how the author explains ADHD. I think that is because she talks from a professional and a personal point of view; she has two sons with the condition. I wish, I could get this book in spanish!"
5,Awesome!,This is an awesome CD. I love Kara's music as it speaks to my soul. I am thoroughly enjoying it!
2,Piece of Crap,"I bought this for a friend's daughter for Christmas. We opened it together and immediately started putting it together, using the instructions. It worked for about 5 seconds then got stuck and stopped working. Never worked again and I tried everything to fix it. Waste of money and I had to return it. Don't waste your money, seriously. I would never buy this again."
1,bead scene blues,I purchaded this toy for my seven year old daughter for Christmas. She tried making a bracelet once and has never used it since then. It is very difficult to use. The beads constantly get stuck and it is very frustrating tying the string. I definetely do not recommend this toy.
3,completely broken on the first day,"My child was really looking forward to using this bead maker. In the first 10 minutes the loop that holds the thread was broken. Then, within the half-hour, the toy was completely broken. The tension built up when a bead was lodged in the spring-like loader. This was a continual problem, which explains why the toy has a forward and reverse setting. When a bead was wedged in and my child didn't stop the motor quick enough, the spring snapped off altogher. Very disappointing. We didn't even get one piece of jewelry. Do not waste your money on this toy."
2,Compaq Presario 5012US,"Aside from the fact that it's difficult to find a way to remove the drives - no screws that I've found, I got a run around when trying to obtain tech support. It seems that a common problem is with the CD drive door eventually opening and closing non-stop without being able to read a disk. Compaq wouldn't even send me a restore disk that wasn't included when I bought my computer new. Of course, they would let me buy one which I didn't. My extended warranty is basically worthless, and all Compaq and HP did was try to get me to pay even more money for additional phone support. It looks like I'll have to pay for a new CD drive myself or fix it. I'd never buy another Compaq or HP product. To me, service and reliability go hand in hand."
1,Junkiest computer I have used,"I bought this computer in March. It is the worst computer that I have had. The CD- Writer, only works half the time. I have the 40 gb hard drive and every time you go over 10 gb, you have to restore the computer. The CD-ROM drive does not close anymore, you have to push it in. There is a short on the left speaker, it does not work anymore. The computer has many lock-ups and freezes. Some times windows does not even start-up. I would recommend Gateway or Dell, they have a lot more opitions, and better value than compaq"
1,Elastikon Tape,"What was sent to me was NOT ""Elastikon"", but a cheaper veterinary version.It's a very different product with less stick and is much lighter weight. If you're looking for ""Elastikon"" athletic tape, this isn't it. It would be helpful to have this specified. I sent mine back."
2,Not what I ordered,"I ordered Elastikon, which is a name brand of a product by Johnson and Johnson Company.Instead I got a different type of elastic tape which does not compare to Elastikon. I didn't return it because I needed it at the time. The tape does the job, but curls up after you cut a piece and is very difficult to work with. It doesn't hold up as well as the real Elastikon does.This product should not be sold as ""Elastikon"" as it is not Elastikon."
1,Not what it says,"This is NOT Elastikon tape. It is a similar, lower quality veterinarian tape. If you need it for your pet, great. If you want Johnson & Johnson Elastikon tape, this is falsely advertised (Elastikon is a trademark). They did send a postage paid return label, but I am still waiting for my refund."
1,NOT the Elastikon from J&J. A fake product.,"Elastikon is a trademark from Johnson & Johnson company and it can only be used to call their specific product. However, what I got from this seller is a box of ""Elastiant"" from VetOne. This wierd product looks kinda similar to Elastikon but has a very strong, distinctive odor that is very bothering (unlike the real Elastikon).Elastikon from J&J; should receive 5 stars. But in this review I give only one start because what you get is something called Elastiant from VetOne.Don't buy this product. You will be frustrated for sure. I am seeing if I can return my items to the seller for refund."
4,NOT ELASTIKON but great price and works well,"As other reviews have said, this is not J&J's ELASTIKON tape. It's a generic brand (""Elastiant"" from VetOne). I knew that from other reviews and bought it based on price since using for normal use for dog injuries. It isn't as sticky as Elastikon but still works and sticks to dog fur and itself. Just put a strip of medical tape on end prevents any rolling up of end."
3,A good addition for any reference library.,This book is great for anyone who wants a better understanding regarding the issue of how black students live and perform in white institutions. As a black male I was able to identify with many of the points mentioned in the book. The fact that the authors used data collected from group and individual interviews they conducted was a good idea. The only thing that kept me from giving the book a higher rating was the fact that the authors only used actual school names at certain times. I don't know if this was done to protect the subjects or what. I would have enjoyed the book better if ALL school names were mentioned that they collected data from.
2,"Good, if you like down-home 50's slow rock","To tell you the truth, this CD is boring! I just bought it because I love Rose McGowan, and she's in the movie. But the CD is just a bunch of really really REALLY old old old music that makes you want to go to sleep. There's a few songs on there that aren't that bad for instrumental tunes, but overall, the CD ain't nuthing great!"
2,"Bill, give us more dialog!","As a European who lived and travelled in the States some years ago, I must say that I was surprised by the very limited number of human contacts Bryson made while travelling through small-town America. He seems to be spending all his time driving alone, eating alone (fast food which he abhors) and sleeping alone, in a country rightly famous for the ease with which you can make new acquaintances.He makes no new friends, never gets invited into a local's house, casual conversation is minimal. Compared to his Aussie book (Down Under) which is rich in hilarious dialog, this one is almost 100% descriptive. If I am not mistaken, this is one of Bryson's first books which is perhaps the reason why his writing technique is not as good as in his later works. Nevertheless, if you are a Bryson fan, by all means buy this book!"
2,Sometimes amusing but frequently annoying travelogue.,"Bill Bryson can be witty and can certainly turn a phrase, but the insights are few and far between in this book. He skewers easy targets; fat, poorly dressed tourists, southern accents, the American dependence on automobiles, strip malls, the decay of Main St mom and pop businesses, interstate highways and tacky tourist traps. There may be a few cliches he missed, but none come to mind. Bill came home to America and discovered that it isn't 1965 and it isn't Europe. Rather than discovering America, he starts with preconceived notions and merely reinforces them. His more recent book ""A Walk in the Woods"", is a much more thoughtful look at America and has some genuine insight, read it instead."
2,A Cynics Dream,"I think the reviewers overrate this book, which leads me to believe that only people who completely enjoy or completely despise books decide to write reviews. If you're cynical, as my last statement proves I am, then you will enjoy Bryson's digs on small town America. But the reality is that he is only contributing to the stereotypes ""normal"" Americans love to hear. We want to laugh at accents and old fat people but you may find that some of the things he criticizes we hold dear and will defend. Is there a place on earth he can't find fault with? Approach this book with an open mind and don't take his barbs so seriously. After all, some of Bryson's shortcomings came through in this book whether he knew it or not."
2,Lost in his writing,"Mr. Bryson's writing which sparkled when he wrote about his travels in England, seems flat in this sad story about his attempts to discover America. Perhaps the flatness mirrors the flatness of his home state of Iowa, but for whatever reason it's more of a sad commentary on the isolation and fragmentation of society. Bryson is a humorist first and travel writer second, and when the liveliness fails hims, there is little left. Putting this book down was not hard. I had expected more."
2,Read Another Bryson Book...,"Bill Bryson drives aimlessly around America by himself and complains. Not his best work. Anyone who tucks into chicken fried steak every night doesn't get to critique restaurants. If he bothered to study about any culture other than Anglo-American, he might enjoy some of the areas he traveled through. He manages to use racial terms I honestly have not heard in three decades."
2,Entertaining but leaves a sour taste,"Having been to many of the places Bryson visited in this book, I find myself wondering how he could possibly have had such an apparently unpleasant time. Bryson's wit in this volume is not just biting, it's acidic, even heartless. This book will make you chuckle, but even most of the laughs leave a bad taste in the mouth. I have greatly enjoyed three other Bryson books, but I can't really recommend this one."
2,Audio book is horrible,"I'm sorry I didn't read all the reviews on this before I got the audio book from the library - I would have learned more about this horrible audio book. Bill Bryson usually reads his own books and that's really the only way it can be with Bryson's books, because his humor doesn't translate well in other people. Kerry Shale, the fellow reading the book, reads very quickly (too much caffiene that day?) and while his change in voices is good, the overall effect is very bad. I listened for about 20 minutes and since the story was slow in developing I had to turn it off. If you read this one, read the actual book and don't listen to it!"
3,"Quite funny, a bit of beating the horse","I bought this because of the reviews, as I figured I'd be in pain from laughing so hard. I travel a lot, especially to National Parks and Battlefields.I laughed a bit, even a few times out loud, but after the first few chapters it grew a bit weary on me. It unfortunately was the same tale at every place the author went. Fat women in bad shorts, ugly rowdy kids, and dull visitor's centers. Yes, we know tourist traps are full of chuncky women in tight Bermudas, but didn't Bryson see any hideous men with them?Bryson seems almost content to head back to his flea motel and down a six-pack in bed. Not quite the type of guy to pick on everybody else for their looks.I would still recommend it for frequent travelers, but be prepared for the dislocated American (he moved to England many years back) to be really critical of people he sees along his kind of dull trip."
2,"Shallow, unremarkable travelogue","Shallow, unremarkable travelogue that is short on original insight. The humor grows stale after the first few chapters thanks to an over-reliance on a single spiteful undercurrent."
4,Laughed so hard I cried.,I read this book several months ago on a plane from Atlanta to El Paso. I laughed so hard I cried and pretty soon everyone on the plane was looking at me. I was by myself but had to be moved in between two women and I shared as much as possible with them when I just couldn't stop laughing. I'm sure they thought I was nuts. The last third of the book was an ordinary but interessting travelogue. I really felt like I got my money's worth and it made the long trip home very short indeed. I then sent the book to my sister and my daughter. Anyone who needs a good lauhh should read it
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I enjoy all of Bill Bryson's books, but this was not up to some of his others., His general opinion of his experiences in his travel around the U.S. was not positive and I became a little irritated with the author."
2,"A low quality bash of US small town life, but still funny.","blah, blah, blah...funny remark...blah, blah, blah...complaining about something...blah, blah, blah...funny remark...blah, blah, blah...complaining about something...This is the way the whole book goes. So, if the redundant humor/satire and bashes against the US will keep you entertained then go ahead and pick it up. Otherwise, it really wasn't worth it for me. I am glad he has decided to stay in England."
2,"Moderately funny at times, mostly liberal drivel.","So a guy takes a trip around America and finds something wrong with our country at every turn. He doesn't believe in God, hates all Republicans (especially Reagan) and disrespects war heroes like Eisenhower. If he hates America so much maybe he should move to another country. Oh wait, he did that. He just came back here to write this book and make some money."
1,A big Disappointment,"""The Lost Continent"" is a huge disappointment of a book. Bryson is mean spirited, disrespectful, cynical, redundant, and seldom funny. I have not traveled to most of the states in this book, so it's not as if I was personally insulted by his comments. The only other Bryson Book I have read is a ""Walk in the Woods"", so this book is a bit of a surprise. I doubt that I will waste my time reading any of his other books."
1,Adolescent,"I am so disappointed with this book. Bryson comes off with an annoying and bitter adolescent attitude in this work. A week before I began reading The Lost Continent, I was lamenting about my nephew's 'blog. --The whole ""oh gee, I'm soooo much hipper than everyone else and I think I'll make fun of everyone in my writing to prove it."" I see little difference between Bryson's book and my nephew's adolescent rantings.I don't have to have a happy ending or a happy book -- but Bryson is simply mean and shallow in his treatment of small town America."
2,"Bitter, cynical middle-age man does America.","Bill Bryson's idea of ""discovering"" America is driving a few hundred miles to a new city each day, and stepping no more than 25 paces away from his car. No wonder he's so bitter over everything he finds! Everything he sees is covered with concrete, greasy spoon restaurants and annoying tacky tourists. We don't get any useful information about any place he visits, only cynical commentary on the local fat people, or obnoxious tourist trap. There are a few funny moments, but most of his writing here is so grouchy and listless that the book drags on and on and on. Anyone who can turn up their nose at Yellowstone National Park, and find absolutely no flaw with Wall Drug has missed the point somewhere."
3,"Hilarious tour of America, circa 1988","Fans of Bill Bryson will enjoy this book. He's up to his usual hilarious self, with observations about America (late 1980s) that will make you laugh so hard you have to put the book down. Unfortunately, I found his occasional political observations out of place, ill-tempered and unnecessary. Without those, it would have been a much better book."
4,Bryson is funny while reassuring Brits of their worth...,"This is a very funny book, which certainly made me laugh. The fact that some readers have disliked Bryson's very mild criticism of his own country just goes to prove how well aimed Bryson't wit is. I have but one negative comment, which applies to all of Bill Bryson's books: he knows that his main market is Great Britain and goes out of his way to reassure his British readers that, oh, they are so lucky to be British! But you can't blame the man for protecting his source of income..."
4,"Cynical, p**** but hilarious counterpoint to Blue Highways","Bill Bryson brings a unique viewpoint to his writing abouttravelling around America. An expatriate for twenty years he returnsto rediscover the land of his youth and--not suprpisingly--he finds that some changes have been made. Most are not to his liking. Some red-blooded American readers may take offense at Bryson's withering descriptions of the denizens of America's small towns, tourists, K-Mart, RVers, scenic highways , southern cops and cultural icons, but I found it insightful and very, very funny. Bryson contrasts the America he remembers from his childhood with the America he encounters upon his return in ways that highlight changes the rest of us might not have noticed or just accepted without too much thought. Some readers may get a little tired of Bryson's chronic crankiness and exaggerated-for-effect descripitions of people or places that arouse his ire but I think they'll find his points are generally right on the nose."
2,Petulant and smug travelogue,"I snatched this up after thoroughly enjoying ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"", but this book has forever put me off of anything else Mr. Bryson will ever write. It's relentlessly arrogant and petty, and overall just extremely tiresome. For someone who harps on and on about the lack of civility from those he encounters, he doesn't really seem capable of displaying any himself. Particularly in his encounters with waitresses he comes off as a first class jackass.If you want a narrow-minded journal of a pathetic anglophile's tour of the US, by all means pick up the book. Personally I think there are better ways to spend one's time and money."
3,"Funny parts, but overall mean spirited and lacking charm","I do not write many reviews, but I just completed this book and really felt the need to share my thoughts since the book was so much less than I expected. And it seems like many others share my opinion.This is the third Bill Bryson book. I have previously read ""In a Sunburned Country"" and ""A Walk In The Woods."" I doubt I would have read either of these if I read ""the lost continent"" first. While there are some ""laugh our loud? passages, I felt the book was mean spirited. I understand this is a satire, but a good satire is not so negative. I suspect if Mr. Bryson was writing the book today, it would have the charm of his later books."
2,Not one of his best,"This book reads more like a ""why I miss England"" book. For most of the book, he complains about every part of America he drives through. True, while there are plenty of boring places, and the ""old town"" lifestyle that Bryson loved so much in Iowa no longer existed by the time he took his tour in the 1980s, there really is no need to make the harsh comparisons between American and England. Each place has its own merits and faults. In all honesty, I think this book would be best read by someone not from America who wants to get a baised opinion about what is wrong with the country. There is little that is funny in the book (I laughed twice--total). I bought the book hoping for a great and laugh-out-loud story like ""Thunderbolt Kid."" I was sorely dissappointed."
2,horrible audiobook narration,"I love Bill Bryson. I love to listen to his narration of his books during my long commute to work. I didn't even notice that someone else was reading this audiobook until I started to listen. No bother, it'll still be great, right? Wrong. Kerry Shale narrates this at high speed, making you wish ""slow down"" was an option on the cd player. He's overly sarcastic, making Bill's subtle jabs sound down-right mean. It's only 2 discs long, but I can't help but wonder if it would have been 3 or 4 if Bill had read it in that wonderful way he has. I had to stop listening after about 5 minutes."
2,The Lost Continent-not so great,"This is a poor book, for the most part. Bill Bryson is a good writer, as his other books prove. However, I found myself quickly tiring of his whining and negative attitude as he recounts his travels through America. This book is repetitious and a little too cynical for my taste. I much preferred A Walk in the Woods. Though Bryson has a lot of amusing tales, for the most part, the attitude of his writing made me feel a little dark, soiled and depressed at the book's end. I'm glad I only borrowed this book from the library and didn't waste my money on it."
2,Disappointment,"I was so disappointed. I have read other Bill Bryson books and loved them. This one is terribly boring. It just goes over boring stereo-types of different regions of the U.S. I had to struggle to finish it. I kept hoping it would get more interesting, but it never does. However, Down Under (In a Sunburned Country) is hysterical, and has tons of interesting facts."
3,Better Bill Bryson books to he bad,"This book was ok, I finished it, i laughed a bit, but it was ENTIRELY TOO REPETITIVE. If you want to read a better, and funnier Bryson book try A Walk in The Woods."
1,Mr. Bryson should not have left England,"This book is not only poorly written, it appears there was little if any research done prior to publishing, i.e. Gold was not discovered in Sutter Creek CA. He was so negative about all of America, it makes me wonder why he choose to return here. I have lived in England and found his glowing comments about this lovely country untrue in many cases. Both countries have pro's and con's. I did finish this book, but was unable to continue with the book on England."
5,In Search Of 1950's Small Town America!!!,"Once again Bill Bryson hits the open road but this time he is in his car not on foot as he was in his book ""A Walk In THe Woods"". Bill travels through 38 States in search of a Mythical town that he used to see portrayed on television during his youth in the 1950's.Bill gets very close to realizing this fantasy at times but finally realizes that this town is basically a mixture of all the good things he discovers in other towns on his journey. This book is very funny and a Joy to read.It is a testament to the author's writing skills that he can make a simple road trip so entertaining and fun to read. Just like John Steinbeck in ""Travels With Charlie"" Bill laments the great Superhighways that he finds himself driving on, the disappearance of roadside stalls selling fresh fruit and vegetables and the absence of billboards promoting Burma Shave!!!This is a wondrous tour through small town America . Well done Bill!!!"
5,seriously hilarious,"bill bryson....is a combination of hilarity and scholarship...i put him down as one of my guests for a ""fantasy dinner party""...and this book is one of the reasons why"
1,"20% funny, 80% whining","This book gets off to a roaring start. I found it hilarious, though many would find it offensive. Unfortunately, Bill quickly tires of his journey, and the last 80% of the book is non-stop whining. He complains about EVERYTHING."
1,love Bill Bryson-- hate this book,"Usually, Bryson is down right-laugh out loud funny... This book was a whiney travelogue of uninteresting places.There are many lovely, interesting small towns throughout the US, Bryson didn't find one of them. And similarly, there are numerous unique characters in the country and Bryson didn't meet any of them. Just traveling around small towns, expecting some sort of revelation about yourself and life growing up in the middle of nowhere... could happen, but didn't.Not a bright spot among these leaves!"
2,Why did I keep reading?,"I had read ""A Walk in the Woods"" and loved it. So much so, that all my family members got it as a Christmas gift. On recommendation of a classmate, I checked this book out from the library. Thank god I didn't buy it. It took me forever to read. Mostly because he was just plain mean. I kept picking it up, thinking that it was going to get better. NO. If you aren't into this book within the first 50 pages, your not going to enjoy it."
2,Not one of his better books,"In recounting his journeys through small-town U.S.A., Bryson provides some hilarious episodes and some insights - particularly about the over-commercialization of the landscape and careless destruction of natural and historical treasures. But this book is marred by too many complaints about bad food and lodging as well as careless generalizations, especially about the South. He also appears to have made almost no meaningful contacts with the locals in his travels. Compare this book to William Least Heat Moon's ""Blue Highways,"" and you will see that Moon is much, much better."
3,There's No Place Like Home,"I love travel books, and this was a fun one. Bryson drives from Iowa to New England, passing through countless small towns, and also such storied American cities as Charleston, New York City, and Plymouth. Then he drives westward nearly to the Pacific Ocean. Bryson's western loop seems more natural wonder-oriented, as he passes through such magnificent places as Death Valley, Grand Canyon, and Yellowstone.Bryson is British, though he has spent much of his life in the US. His wry, stranger-in-a-strange-land observations on encounters in small-town restaurants and attractions will make you laugh. However, at times Bryson doesn't seem to have enjoyed his trip very much, and his blatant relief at coming home to Des Moines echoes Dorothy Gale in saying, ""There's no place like home."" I've crossed Iowa a few times, and my feelings are the near-opposite of Bryson's. There's nothing like finally escaping the cornfields and flatlands of Iowa!"
3,"Some humor, some humorless","If you'd find humorous the profound misery of someone driving across the country and intentionally avoiding the most interesting parts, and I do, then this book is a nice read. It reads incredibly quickly, as there isn't much information to digest. This is time-passing stuff....plane or bathroom reading, plenty monotonous enough to put you to sleep. But it's also more relevant than ever, and Bryson's acidic observations about the often terrible people that inhabit small town America seem quaint compared with what he might find there now, 20 years later."
3,Non Fiction,"I read this after having been through and in a few of the places Bill Bryson mentions in The Lost Continent : Travels in Small-town America, so at the time I found parts of it highly entertaining. Accounts of Nowheresville, USA are not going to be too interesting if you get lots and lots and lots of them, though."
3,NOT HIS BEST WORK,"I think Bill Bryson can be very funny. ""In A Sunburned Land"" was hilarious, whereas this was pretty much trite and dated humor. In fact it reminded me of the kind of humor undergraduate English Majors at overated eastern liberal arts colleges would find funny. The beginning of the book is an ongoing insult of everyone, the middle he calms dawn, and he ends really trying to force some funny. It's a very dated and poor effort by a usually funny man. Skip it."
2,Snarky not funny,"Bryson is a pretty good writer. His prose is flowing and very easy to read. This book is 300 pages and I read it in 3 days.My complaint is his lousy attitude toward people. He made fun of just about everyone but gave his most scathing comments to overweight woman. Plus, this is a book about traveling across America. I don't mind Americans complaining about what's wrong here. I do it myself occasionally. I don't mind people in other countries criticizing the USA. I make judgments about other countries, some unflattering. But there is something grating about Americans living in other countries coming back to travel the USA and taking potshots at our way of life and poking fun at the working poor. Stay in England if it's so bad here."
2,Mediocre,"While humorous at times, the book seems to be an endless dialouge of Mr. Bryson's dissappointment of small town America. The author does a good job of describing the countless towns he visits enabling the reader to be an armchair traveller with a good view of life in U.S., but I found myself depressed at the end of each chapter as he conveys his distaste for the people, food, accomidations and atmosphere of every town he visits.If you want Bryson at his best read A Walk In The Woods, a ""pee-your-pants"" funny book of his travels on the Appalachian Trail"
2,Can't recommend,"I enjoyed Bryson's Walk in the Woods and recommend it frequently. I wish I could say the same about this book. Bryson would be the ultimate joykill on a road trip: arrogant, exceedingly negative and critical, and unable to poke fun at himself. Buy Walk in the Woods instead."
3,Bryson Falls Short,"I am a big fan of Bill Bryson, his books are great, and they always make me laugh. This book however fell short, all it could muster was a few chuckles. I liked the book, it was however somewhat repetetive with lots of talk about gas stations and grubby restaurants and Bill's harsh reviews of most of the towns he travelled through. It was an interesting book nonetheless. If you're a big Bryson fan, might as well read it."
3,"SO HARSH, BUT SO REAL !","JUST READ THIS BOOK ON A PLANE GOING BACK TO FRANCE, SPEND SOME WEEKS IN THE DEEP NOWHERE FROM THE DEEP AMERICA, THIS VIEW POINT REFLECTS EXACTLY WHAT AN EUROPEAN CAN FEEL ABOUT UNITED STATES : A MELT OF LOVE (YES, REALLY !) AND IRONY ABOUT WHAT THE EUROPEAN ARE GOING TO CHANGE. C'EST A LA FOIS UNE CRUELLE SATIRE DE L'AMERIQUE PROFONDE MAIS AUSSI UNE VISION EFFRAYEE DE CE QUE SONT (OU VONT DEVENIR) LES EUROPEENS."
2,Too much critical humor,I quit about halfway through this book. Making fun of people does not hold my interest and is not humorous.
1,Loser -- Deserves no stars,"Save your money, don't buy this book. Too bad I can't give this book a NO-STAR rating. Bryson seems to find little to like in the US. He's surprised by the sand on Cape Cod and amazed by southern accents. I got a few laughs at the start of this book, but soon it turned nasty and cynical. Bryson wants to follow in the footsteps of Dave Barry, but Barry offers humor without the caustic bite I find in Bryson's writing. I got halfway through this book and tossed it in the paper-recycle bin."
1,The Lost Continent,"A boring trip written by a fat, coarse author. I'm thankful I've traveled many of the states that make up the USA without Bryson's help. It is true that many people in the United States regret the demise of the Americana of our cities and towns, but his portrayal was oftentimes unfair or simply incorrect. Too many drinks do an eye blear. Under those circumstances it might have been better for us and Mr. Bryson had he just forgotten this entire trip. Thank goodness, he writes more humorously and intellectually and less self-centeredly in his later years."
1,Meanness is not humor.,"Just because a writer can turna phrase doesn't make what he says funny. Apparently Bryson needed to make a car payment so he cranked out this book. There clearly is not a town or a person in America that Bill Bryson cares for, so it's a good thing he lives in England. This is not a gentle joshing of small town quirks or traditions - it's outright trashing of everything he sees right down to calling the waitresses ugly and wishing he could bash an old lady's head because she talked too much. I didn't finish it, and frankly, I'm not turning it back to the used bookstore - I'm throwing it away. You want a travelogue through small-town America? Go read Steinbeck or Charles Kuralt, or plenty of others."
2,Bryson tries too hard bashing the USA for English readers.,"Funny, but Mr. Bryson tries too hard making the book funny for his English audience. Most of his preconceptions are outdated. Since the book is 10 years old, some of that is understandable. It would have been better had he compared his actual experience against the preconception rather than telling of the foreboding preconception and then fitting the experience to it. If you're from the UK and love this book -- great, but it's not an actual depection of reality in the USA."
1,mean spirited,"While I have enjoyed other books by Bryson, especially Made in America, I found this one to me more mean spirited than funny. I, like some of the other reviewers, have been to many of the places written about here and do not recognize them from Bryson's descriptions."
5,"You'll laugh, you'll cry. You'll laugh until you cry!!!","This book is absolutely hilarious, and Bill Bryson, is, in my opinion, the best writer the planet ever produced.Boy oh boy do I envy anyone who has not read Bill Bryson's books, because you still have all that pleasure in front of you!"
4,From a small town? Read this book,"I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Bryson's book about his journey through small town America. Several times I was laughing out loud and had to read aloud to my husband. If you are from a small town, you will be able to relate to the author's observations and experiences. Yes, he does at times seem a bit cruel in his comments but take it with a grain of salt. His genuine love for his home country is obvious. I recommend the book for several good laughs."
4,Bill Bryson does it again!,"This is the second book I've read of Bryson's & being from Iowa myself, understand his humor perfectly. I don't agree with all of his conclusions/assumptions of our diverse country, but it does take you on a imaginative journey. A must read for any U.S. traveller."
1,snore,"Bryson continually bemoans the obesity of Americans. Continually. It gets rather tiresome. While I wouldn't label Bryson as obese, I certainly wouldn't say that he was all that fit.The book gave me the impression that he spent little more than an hour in each of the towns he visited which is hardly enough time to form an impression of any value. Gas station here, fat woman there.This isn't traveling, Bryson. It is simply driving and stopping for gas."
1,Condescending and uninformed,"I was very disappointed in, and angered by, this book. Having lived in a couple of the small towns that Bryson skewers I was unpleasantly surprised at the arrogant, belittling tone he takes. If all you know about small towns is what you read in this book, you'd assume that all small-town residents fit the stereotype of being backward, country bumpkins who are a bit slow on the uptake and clearly can't match wits with such a pithy author. He insults both the towns and the residents. He mocked one town for being in his drive-thru view little more than a series of strip malls. Having lived in that particular town, it's obvious that he didn't venture a block or two off the main street, where beautiful scenery is plentiful. And I would also add that this town is the friendliest place I've ever lived. If Bryson's intention was to come off as a big city elitist he succeeded."
1,Not Bryson's Best,"This book proved to be a disappointment. Whereas Bryson was witty and entertaining in books such as A Walk in the Woods and In a Sunburned Country, he was simply profane and sarcastic in Lost Continent. His generalizations were based on first impressions and left me with the feeling that he wrote the book without taking the time to research the subject. He wrote with a definate bias. Bill should have stayed in England if he thinks so little of the USA."
4,"Witty and observant, but tone gets tiresome","Bryson is a very good travel writer and a clever social critic, but people expecting a book on par with A Walk in the Woods might find themselves a bit disappointed. Bryson is very funny, but I think he employs an English sense of humor which tends to run a bit more biting than the American brand. He's clever, he's more accurate than many of us want to admit, but it gets tough to read a couple hundred pages from someone who sounds an awful lot like a cynic. Like the back of the book says, he's as observant as de Tocqueville, but he's less optimistic. A good book from a good writer, but be warned."
1,Where is this dude?,"re>Carbondale, IllinoisThis must be a tale of fiction. The accuracy of Carbondale, Illinois is very lacking. #1 Sounds to me like he drive through the center of town TWICE and missed everything. KFC & LJSilvers are BLOCKS apart and there is no ""white wall"" around either forcing one to drive from one location to the next. Never has been. And neither has moved since they came to town. Mr. Bryson must have been stumbling drunk on this trip of in some other dimension because his reality is wildly off.http://books.google.com/books?id=2Uk-UnvvUEcC&pg;=PA46&lpg;=PA46&dq;=bill+bryson+carbondale&source;=bl&ots;=x9MONCS2DR&sig;=CIzjkISqCW_24p1DMCshntYXg10&hl;=en&ei;=qFL4TN6vGKrSnAeHr9XCAw&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result#v=onepage&q;=bill%20bryson%20carbondale&f;=false"
5,Looking for America,"Bill Bryson's book, the Lost Continent, is the quintessential looking for Americabook. After living in England for many years, the author comes home and tries to findthe small town America he remembers from old tv shows. He mostly fails, but his sardonicwit and clear point of view makes this a hilarious and enjoyable read."
5,very fun-to-read book,"I have experienced many of the places Bryson described in this wonderful book. With each stop, I enjoyed reliving the journey. Bill wrote in a way that made me laugh... often. I was sorry to finish the book."
3,Entertaining trip around America,"Having read a part of his new book ""Notes from a big Country-1998"" I was inspired to grab anything he wrote. This book in not as funny as his latest, which dissappointed me as I bought it for humour,but all the same it held my interest. As a book on travel, it does get a bit slow part way through, but pressing on was worth it. I can't wait to read another of his books. Being his first they can only get better."
4,An affectionate account of life in small town America,I have only been to America once in my life (the obligatory trip to Disneyland). Reading Bill Bryson's experiences in small town America has sparked a yearning to return. His accounts of the people he met and the places he visited are both very funny and display a great deal of warmth towards his country and fellow citizens. (I look forward to him visiting Australia in the not to distant future and 'taking the piss' out of us!!-to quote an Aussie expression). In the meantime I will be brushing up on my southern dialect and I look forward to 'mahking the skwayer' some day in Savannah!!
2,Substandard Bryson,"I picked up this book hoping for the hilarity, irony and insight that I've found in other Bryson works, but was deeply disappointed. There are a few funny and keenly observed passages, but they are overwhelmed by a narrative that is predominantly shallow, repetitive and -- my biggest objection -- haughty and mean-spirited. Bryson is by and large a bracing, talented writer, but this work proves that even great talent can take a wrong turn."
1,Toilet Paper Would Be More Useful,"If you're looking for a diatribe of total exaggeration and falsity, this is your book. Did I say book? Maybe doorstop would be a better description.Having grown up, and traveled extensively through the areas that the author describes with such deft fictitousness, I question whether he ever actually has been to the places he relates.I grew up in the Mid-West and moved out to the West Coast (Portland/San Diego) in my late teens, but the lifestyles the author describes of Iowa in particular are so bent out of proportion, and contrived, that this is one book that should definitely be left in the outhouse."
4,Adventures in late 80's America,"Bill Bryson takes you along on a tour of America, in a Chevette. Hilarity ensues.Seriously though, this book is interesting because it focuses on the small towns that make up the united states. Bryson delves into what makes a ""perfect"" town and eventually decides that such a thing probably doesn't exist. The book came out a while ago so some of it feels a bit dated but its that good kind of dated, like hearing a song from your childhood on a car's stereo as it drives by. Nostalgic with a touch of cynicism. In other words, a good book to read while feeling contemplative. Or when planning a roadtrip."
4,The Lost Continent,"The Lost Continent drives the reader through small town America. Told with a sense of humor and attention to detail, Bryson makes the reader feel like they are riding in the passengers seat as he drives from one town to another. As he drives into familiar towns, he shares his reflections on how life was and how it has changed over time. An interesting read for someone who enjoys long cross country road trips."
1,A bitter and unpleasant trip down memory lane,"Bill Bryson crosses the line between humorous sarcasm to just plain bitter, hateful commentary on perfectly lovely spots. He greedily latches on to any stereotype available and exploits it. He happily criticizes events and places he doesn't even visit. I'm sorry he had such a miserable childhood and angry relationship with his father, but I don't think that justifies trashing an entire country. To Bill, I offer sympathies for a sorrowful youth that has obviously left deep an painful scars even well into his adult years.I'm so sad to have spent money on this book. I loved Bryson's Walk in the Woods, and hope to enjoy the Sunburned Country. But the Lost Continent is going in the trash."
1,A major disservice to the book,"The book THE LOST CONTINENT is an amazing captivating read. Bryson is truly brilliant in his descriptions. This CD totally KILLS that. First of all the narrator reads at a mile a minute, sometimes to the point where you can't understand him. And second, they abridged the CRAP out of it, cutting some of the most interesting commentary and actually cutting the entire SECOND HALF of the book! While the book is amazing, this particular recording of it should be avoided at all costs."
1,First book I ever threw in the trash!,"I read A Walk in the Woods, and though it had a slow section in the middle I thoroughly enjoyed it. So therefore for my birthday I asked for and received the Lost Continent. What a mistake that was. I read it until he was in North Carolina. That was about 5 states too far! I literally threw it at the wall after I read yet another condescending slam on some poor American slob just like me. What an ignorant idiot this guy is (or was back then). He should have stayed in England if America sucks so bad. I buy books to read and keep. This is absolutely the first, and hopefully the last that I ever threw away, and then made sure I dumped coffee grounds on it in the trash the next morning. Take that Bryson. Stay in England!"
4,Hilarious,One of the funniest books I've ever read. He makes so many snide remarks that make you laugh outloud. He writes what we are all thinking at some time.
1,"Just like so many previous reviewers,","I didn't like this book at all. I've been many of the places that Bryson visits in the book. I grew up in the same part of the country that he comes from. I hoped that this book would be a funny and light-hearted look at a side of America that I call home. While it is somewhat humorous, I found that his constant sarcasm and cynisism negated most of the laughs.Plain and simple, he pokes fun at America as a foreigner. I was hoping for a book that read like a buddy joking with me. Instead, reading this book is like listening to a girlfriend pointing out all that is wrong with me."
5,Great book!,"This book represents the best of Bryson's work to-date. He completely captures the heart and soul of towns throughout America. Bryson has an amazing talent of bringing you with him to these towns such as Pella, Iowa or Springfield, Illinois. He offers a unique perspective on Americans within each place he visits on this journey. Bryson inspires you to want to drive across America and experience each little thing like eating in a small diner or talking to locals throughout the country. Great book filled with detailed description about the place he visits and the people he mets along the way."
2,A bit depressing,"I've read and enjoyed other Bryson books, but this one was just not that funny. I feel sorry that some people who have never visited the US might read this and think we are a nation of Crudvilles. Bryson cracks on Beaufort SC because it's made up of retirees and military. So? I didn't know he disliked military families so much. I can tell by his anti-conservative attacks early on, but I don't understand this. He keeps telling us how cheap his father was, but he rants at the admission fees and evidently stays at cheap motels (pool tables with sheets for beds). The book has Small Town in the title but he visits Dearborn, New York City, DC, etc. It has its funny moments but overall I was left at the end thinking, ""What DOES he like?"""
2,Disappointed!,I was hoping that I would add dozens of interesting places to our vacation destinations for years to come. He could have presented the towns in a humorous manner without being so synical and negative.. The United States has many wonderful towns with very caring and interesting people.
1,Don't waste your time reading this drivel!,"Mr. Bryson is a writer of astonishingly meager abilities...here is a potentially rich and fascinating subject to which he has failed miserably to do justice, and the monumental chip on his shoulder makes for tortured reading. If I could have awarded him 0 stars, I would have! Look elsewhere for intelligent, enlightened, and humorous travel writing!"
2,dark job by a whiny hatchet man--read the later works,"My overall recommendation is to read Bryson's brilliantly funny recent works, then go back to less recent works, then stop before you get to this one. As other discerning reviewers have noted (especially Amer-Aussie, whose spot-on review you really must mark as 'helpful'), Bryson looks for the worst in America and, surprise, he finds it. Sure, there's much that's funny here, but the humor gets swallowed up by the mean.Let me add one more observation, which amazingly seems to have eluded all: one of Bryson's worst habits--even worse than his penchant for telling you where he is politically (he hates Republicans)--is his smug disdain for and ridicule of religion, particularly Christianity. Happily, Bryson's later books show a maturity absent in this one."
2,Enough with the complaining,"I am a Bill Bryson fan but this book got old very quickly. Older middle aged readers might relate, as I did, to the endless car trips we took when we were young, in my case from Pittsburgh to Miami Beach in the summer without air conditioning. We loved the Burma Shave signs.The book did have a touch of Bryson's droll humor, but complaining is not funny and endlessly finding fault left me a bit defensive about small town America. I think younger readers would find it hard to connect with this book at all, other than as a history lesson, and the story of small towns in America is much more pleasant than depicted by Bryson. Maybe his writing can be better appreciated when his target is not so close to home."
4,Find the Lost Continent,"This is a very funny book. Bryson's two road trips, covering 38 of the 48 continental United States, wind through many famous sites and cities as well as many small towns and endless boring miles in the Midwest. He takes these routes in search of the idyllic small towns he remembers from his youth and imagines, but instead finds that the strip malls, fast food joints and cheap hotels that dominate larger towns have taken hold everywhere. His descriptions of the people and places he visits are hilarious and I think it is too bad some reviewers take his comments personally. He was certainly exaggerating and generalizing his statments for humor, but that makes it entertaining. Certainly he comes off a bit whiny and sometimes mean, but that is Bryson's style and the way he writes all of his books. This is the most enjoyable Bryson book I've read to this point and I think anyone who has ever taken a car trip will appreciate it. It is excellent summer vacation reading."
2,Bill Bryson has lost something ...,"What a disappointment! I have read all of Bill Bryson's other books eagerly and they were some of the best entertainment I've had with a mix of sarcasm and an appreciation for life. This newest book is written by a Bill Bryson who has evidently become a bitter old man. His humor is weak, and his sarcasm is mean and cold. He has none of the balance of positive with negative that made his previous books a delight. If you love Bill Bryson . . . don't buy this book!"
1,Depressing.,"Try as I might, I found this book neither witty nor real. After the first chapter, one could only sumise Mr. Bryson to be a very unhappy person, and using writing as his tool for therapy. Every sentence of every chapter is such a dreary and negative depiction of people and life in the States. My only question... why did he choose to move back to the States?"
3,"Good clean, cantankerous fun","Bryson's ""The Lost Continent"" isn't his best work, but it's still pretty good. Compared to his other books (I've read ""In a Sunburned Country"" and ""A Walk in the Woods""), this one doesn't seem to have much of a spark. It feels like he wrote it more for himself, and less for his readers, as a way to reacquaint himself with the United States after a 10-year stint in England. That said, I enjoyed reading ""The Lost Continent"" all the same. Sure, his bleating and whining about American foibles gets a little old, but his sense of humor and poignant observations are classic Bryson: just good, clean cantankerous fun. If you're looking for a great piece of travel writing, I don't recommend ""The Lost Continent."" Nor will you like it if you're thin-skinned about American criticism. But if you want a quick and enjoyable read, with plenty of humorous tales, then Bryson, as usual, won't disappoint you here."
2,a mean spirited journey,"I love car trips and also have memories of childhood back seat adventures, so I looked forward to this read. I made it about half way through and gave it up as a depressing waste of time. For a much better look at regional quirks and differences I recommend another mid-westerner, Calvin Trillin. In ALICE, LET'S EAT, for example, he visits places with people much different from himself...and writes with great wit about what he sees and does. If he makes a bit of fun of his adventures it is infused with a fondness for the people he meets and a delightful self deprecating attitude. Quite the opposite of Bryson's arrogant attitude."
4,The Lost Continent by Bill Bryson (audiobook),"The Lost Continent: Travels in Small-Town AmericaHow I enjoyed this audiobook--what a hoot! Once again, I was charmed by Bill Bryson's words and his wry sense of humor. His take on traveling the highways and by-ways will have you giggling and commenting out loud. In trying to maneuver his way through intersections fraught with highway signs (or the lack thereof) to deciphering the local dialect (especially in the deep South) will keep you entertained and nodding your head in agreement. After listening, I was ready to put on my traveling shoes.The only thing negative I have to say about the audio version is that while the intonations were mostly spot on, the reader (Kerry Shale) talked way too fast and, for me, that took away some of the enjoyment of listening. I would have preferred a more leisurely read.But overall, it was quite good and I would highly recommend it."
3,A lot of money for a little entertainment!,"I should have taken note of the reviews for this book. He gets weary and critical from the get-go and never lets up, even after a winter break! I know many of the places and agree with many of his observations but he could have ""lightened up"" a bit! A better read for a third of the price!"
1,complaining!,"This book was the worst of all of Bryson's books that I have read! It is a nonstop complaint of cities and farmland alike. Bryson has absolutely nothing good to say about most of the places he visits. He writes of trying to find the ""perfect"" American town, yet he never ventures far enough to really find it. Instead, he rambles on about horrible food (of course the food will be bad if you don't want to spend any money), boring radio stations (cds or mixes would solve this problem), and mean americans (I would not be friendly either if you are going to complain about my neighbors and business). Please. This country has a lot to offer, and Bryson did not showcase much of it."
2,Mildly amusing (if you are in the mood),"This reads like a book the author wrote to fulfil some contractual obligation.The 'plot' can be summarized as follows: Drive a car into a small town, check into some hotel, make disparaging comments on a few people and then do it all over again. There are some genuinely funny moments in the book but at times it does feel like the author is trying too hard to be funny. Also, a place is pretty or ugly depending on the author's mood.IMO, other reviewers who are offended by the author are missing the point as I don't think he was being serious (I thought this was a dead giveaway when he makes jokes on his parents). But then again, am not an American who grew up in a small town, so its easier for me to feel that way.All in all, a harmless little book which can (will) be forgotten the moment you turn the last page."
3,Check out the originals - Lacuna Coil,"Evanescence is a fine band for the American scene, but they have borrowed heavily from an Italian band that goes by the name of Lacuna Coil.When you are picking up your Evanescence discs please make sure to take a listen to some of the samples of a band that pre-dates Evanescence. They go by the name of Lacuna Coil."
5,HOT Album,"I really Liked this Album..My favorites are ""Bring Me To Life"", ""My Immortal"", and ""Everybody's Fool"". I would Really Recommend that you buy it. Thankx for reading."
5,"Amazing Lyrics, and Powerfull Messages","A great selection of music, in which track by track sendsyou through life's situations. I listened to this cd asI was traveling, and my personal favorite song is My Immortal, amoung other tracks. But that one took me by suprise, I never expected a voice like that from a band like this, definitly 2 thumbs up. Great musicians... and great music..."
5,WEWT,"After getting aquainted with Evanescence through the Daredevil soundtrack and falling in love with Amy Lee's voice in ""Bring Me to Life"" (Paul McCoy rules), I immediately bought this album. As Ben Moody, lead guitarist, said in the video interview, Amy's strong but smooth female voice was the perfect (and only) choice to properly fill out this style of music. And the style... wow. I enjoy the hard metallica/linkin park style heavy guitar very much, and Ben does an excellent job. However, when this is merried with the moving melodies of piano and occasional strings/choir harmony, it gives a sensation like no other. Add on Amy's angel-like voice on long held notes and again... wow. For those who say this album is repetitive with the same style throughout, just compare ""My Immortal"" with the hard-hitting opener ""Going Under""! Talk about contrast. I am blown away. BUY this album. Support Evanescence. Don't steal music. :-)"
3,Different.,"I love this album, even though Im not normally a fan of alternative music. But Amys voice is just too beautiful to pass over. I had been a fan of Evanescence for a few months before finding out they were being released with the Daredevil movie. I have several of their songs downloaded, so I assumed that they would be the same as on the CD. Oddly enough they wern't. Many of the songs have had a lot more guitars added. Even my favorite song, ""Hello"", had a choral background instead of the simple piano and strings background of my mp3. Its not all bad; sometimes you just miss the origonal version. :) However, this album is really good, and I reccomend it."
3,Going Free,"This cd is okayit doesn't give off the ""gothic"" image. Very few songs give off that misunderstood,misguidance theme. No one seems to really feel like this has no hype. But personally i like it and i see nothing wrong with it ,yet i don't believe all the hype. I think there song ""going under"" is there best. Just my opinion."
4,Wow!,"I got this cd in April, because I had heard the songs ""Bring Me to Life"", ""My Immortal"", and ""Going Under"" and I liked them, so I bough the cd. When I got home I popped the cd in my walkman and was like ""Wow!"" There is not one skippable song on this whole album and Amy Lee has an amazing voice! I wish that I could sing half as good as her! Fallen is defenitly (sp?) in my top favorite cds! Anyway, the only reason I gave this cd a 4 and not a 5 was because of My Immortal. When Amy sings My Immortal on this cd, she sounds like she's drunk or something, I hate it when bands have a great song, then you buy the cd and its a compleatly different version! Oh well, there is still alot of great songs on this album."
1,I hate this band!,"I despise Evanescence with every inch of my cold black heart for the following reasons1. No matter what they say, they're pop.2. Amy Lee can't sing, and the backing band sucks.3. They're over-rated.4. Lyrics and riffs more repatative than a Hatebreed album.5. They suck!Instead of this P.O.S., pick up ""Comalies"" by Lacuna Coil."
3,Good but not the best,Ok first things first I keep seeing people comper Evanescence to Nightwish and Lacuna Coil. Well guess what people Nightwish is not like Evanescence in any way shap or form. They are not a goth band.Evanescence is a goth band. They are far to different to even comper.Know on to the Lacuna Coil thing. Again the bands are not the same. Go download old Evanescence and you will see what I mean.Ok know on to the album. It is good not great but good. I thank this band for getting me into other metal band that blow the Nu-metal bands out of the water. Eva is one of the few US bands that I like.
3,it's ok,this thing is'nt the best i've ever herd i mean i like the songs and stuff but there's not enough rockish theme to it.(...)
4,good but a little bit overrated,i like this cd...but only the tracks they DONT play on the radio because the ones they do get way overplayed and i get sick of hearing them. i dont understand why the media has to ruin good bands by over playing them. i have a feeling thats what is going to happen to evanescence.
5,Great Rock Album,"This cd rocks. Amy Lee has such an amazing voice. All the songs are great on this album. ""My Immortal"" is the best song on the album. it is an awesome song and you can feel the emotion coming out of Amy Lee's voice as she is singing the song. If you dont like rock music, this cd is still one that every person should have in their collection. The lyrics can really move you. You rock Amy Lee"
4,Spooky and Spiritual!,"This CD is gets me in the blood pumper! Sad, spooky and downright deep. I loved it and look forward to more."
2,YEAH SWEET TOTALLY GOTHIC I LOVE IT,"I THOUGHT THIS ALBUM WAS SO AWESOME BECAUSE IT WAS THE COST OF ONE ALBUM BUT I GOT ONLY ONE SONG ON A LOOP. MAN, THESE GUYS REMIND OF THIS BAND CALLED KILLSWITCH ENGAGE CUZ THEY SING ABOUT BEING TRAPPED IN SOMETHING. MAYBE IT IS ALIEN GOO, OR THE FUTILITY OF THEIR MUSIC. LUCKILY THE GIRL SINGS REAL GOOD SO YOU CAN'T HEAR THE INSTRUMENTS IN THE BACKGROUND MAKING NOISE."
1,Please Stop,This isn't worth listening to. It doesnt have any potential or anything different about it than any other music. They dont participate in the life of music. .end of transmission. .
2,An athypical album,"The mixture of different types of vocals is not quite achieved in this album; the hard musics are too hard in opposition to beautiful musics like ""my immortal"" or ""hello"". Evanescence have to grow up and define a better musical style: the metal-grunge like ""going under"", or the ballads like ""my immortal"". But this compilation...sucks!"
4,Suicidal?,"Don't get me wrong, Amy Lee has a GREAT voice. However a lot of the songs are very depressing. Expressing your feelings about teenage life are ok, but it's sometimes not ok to talk about suicide, or any form of...well, sadness. A lot of people (especially parents) don't want that type of music. For more mature listeners such as young adults, this is a great choice. In non-lyrical standings, the music is great and the instrumentals on this song are outstanding."
1,Undecided,"I am not sure if the album is a work of genius or a real knockoff. But I don't have much respect for the band or their label's (Wind Up) marketing Department. They Trample all over one set of fans to reach a bigger market. Smart, but evil."
4,Beuatiful,"Don't listen to those people who hate this group. I have severe clinical depression, and although I'm on meds now, the songs resembled me so much it's scary!This album is dark, but is not graphic. Even the lyrics about cutting are vague. The songs ""Hello"" and ""Imaginary"" resembled me to a T! However, all the songs are beautiful, which is rare for a CD.The only reason I am not giving this CD 5 stars, is because it could act as a trigger for self-mutilation. If you have or are recovering from depression and/or suicidal thoughts, DON'T get this CD. Please wait until you are better mentally!Other than that, this CD is excellent!!!"
2,Disapointing,"I can't believe I wanted this so badly. The only good songs are ""Going under"" and ""bring me to life"". I was so exited about ""My Immortal"" because of how it sounded on the radio. Here, it sounds like Amy had a bit to much weed and was tired. I hate it when bands have a radio version and a CD version.Not worth the money.The other songs are so raspy and dry they would burn easier than californias forests."
3,a little too light for me,"I liked this band alot when I first heard them, but after hearing the whole album, I think they are a little to light, and even though she has a good voice it start grating on your nerves after about the 6th song. final thought: not heavy enough, not dark enough (even though some claim this band sounds dark and haunting, I would disagree) good song writing though"
2,Totally overrated...,"I can't believe how much of a fuss has been made over a mediocre band. Sure... they have some decent songs (Bring me to life, Going Under) but they still aren't amazing. I find the lead singer's voice annoying and as far as musical content goes... there is nothing special about this CD. The guitar is just loud, distorted power chords, the drums are average and I don't understand why everyone likes them so much.I don't suggest you buy this CD, mainly because there a way better bands out there. They are definitely NOT the future of rock... unless the future is dull, talentless noise.Better suggestions:A Perfect Circle - Thirteenth StepTool - LateralusDream Theater - Scenes from a Memory"
4,Unique!,"I heard one of their songs on the radio several times and found myself turning it up and really getting in to it. I got two copies of the CD, one for me and one for my fiance. We both love it. The songs are just amazing, especially the first two on the CD. :)"
4,Excellent Debut,"I've seen some harsh critic reviews comparing the band to Tori Amos (huh?) and others (though, in what I've read nothing comparing them to Garbage with a similar gothic/tech rock sensibility). All I've got to say is AT LEAST IT IS DIFFERENT! For those of us (and I'm old enough to have a wide range of musical tastes) not into screaming boys (Incubus, Glassjaw, The Used) or pop (Justin Timberlake, Christina, Kelly Clarkson, etc) the choices are dismal. The writing on this album is a tad weak, the songs a little similar, but it is still good and a change from the usual. Worth the purchase!"
2,hmmm..nah,"I thought I would like this CD, but then when I got it, all of the songs are very slow and melancholy, and they make me depressed. I only really like one or two songs on the whole album...bummer."
2,okay...,"This band/cd would be the best ever if they lost the female vocal. She makes it terrible in my opinion, her voice does not match the rock. The male's vocals on the other hand are fantastic. If he ditched the chick the cd would be off the hook. But in some people's opinion she makes the album good."
1,Its been done,"Bands like this have been around for awhile. To see this get air play and hear people talk about it like its the newest thing is pretty bad considering the fact the there are other bands that are better. Save your money and buy ""Comalies"" by Lacuna Coil or ""Century Child"" by Nightwish."
1,Bad. Really bad.,"Just a look at the cover of this album and I knew it was going to be bad. Just one listen and I knew that the uneducated masses of music listeners would hail it as ""revolutionary"" or a ""step forward"" because it had female vocals. Just one minute into it I knew it was worse than I had expected.This is a media-driven one-trick-pony which neither excites or impresses.This is not innovative. This is not the next big thing.This is garbage."
1,going under,Listen to this CD before jumping out of a tenth story window. It will give you the courage.
5,A little interesting...,"I saw Daredevil on Sunday, and I have heard Bring Me to Life before, and I was thinking of buying Fallen, but I wasn't sure. Until the part in the movie ( I won't spoil it...) when the lady is singing a sad, song and I realized that it was Evanescence, I knew I had to get it. The album itself takes a couple listens to appreciate, but when you do, you'll be glad you bought it."
4,not too bad!,"honestly, where i live, evanescence is pretty big, and when everyone was crazy over them when ""bring me to life"" hit the radio stations, i thought it was just another overrated band. But once i heard ""going under"" and ""my immortal"", i just knew i had to check this cd out...and now i'm a fan! the songs are dark, brooding, and even a bit morbid, but amy lee has such a beautiful voice and most of the songs really rock! my personal faves are ""going under"", and the soft ""hello"", a beautiful, song accompanied with just piano playing and amy lee's voice. if you're a fan of pretty much any type of rock, and love rock bands with female lead singers, pick this up...i don't think you'll regret it!"
1,What's All The Hype About?,"I never understood the hype over Evanescence. Amy Lee's voice is okay, but I think she tries too hard to sound so dramatic and emotional. As a band, something about them seems kind of fake to me with this whole ""gothic/rock"" thing. The lyrics are always so mediocre, while the music is so over the top and dramatic, and every song sounds exactly the same! I have nothing against goth, but seriously, there needs to be a new twist to this genre. It seems like they try way too hard to keep up with the whole ""i'm goth, dark, and creepy"" image. It's just getting sooo old and redundant, and is becoming more of an act. I think this band is overrated. To me they're just pop/rock artists trying way too hard to be goth, with not much substance in their music to make them interesting as a band."
1,"Arrogant Singer, Poser Band, General Poorness","This self obsessed voclaist, Amy Lee ranks amongst my least favourite artists. I saw an interview with her on MTV and she irritated me immensely with her laid back arrogance, strive to look like 'she doesn't give a damn' when in fact she really does. Her attempt to look hippie, scrappy, poor, when in fact she's rolling in money, has a rather posh English accent, comes accross as arrogantly educated, and is obviously no hippie is horrid. She claims 'music is easy, it's just something I do' - f**k right off. Arrogance doesn't bring you fans, you may well be a talented composer, but we don't want to hear outrageous comments about how good you are. Please be quiet."
1,This is Pop/Rap Music,"I don't understand why people would call this band ""a rock band"", in fact they sound like a Pop band with some rapping, if you're looking for real rock/metal music , don't even think of buying this CD, you'll get totally sick!"
5,Goodness!,"It's great! Live, on the radio, on CD, every one of their songs are amazing. Beautiful lyrics, and Amy Lee's voice is unmatchable. Her voice is just as lovely as it is on the CD as it is in real life. It's a pity mine got stolen, I can't wait to get a new one!!"
5,This CD rocks,"Maybe I'm too old for ""goth rock"". I'm not generally into the whole goth scene and all that. But, if you ignore the videos and just listen to the music, it rocks. Great new band."
2,Over-rated,"I liked the first single. Then My Immortal became the most overplayed song of all time. But still I bought the CD because my friend told me how great it was.I liked the first two songs on the CD but then realized that all the songs sound the same with the exception of My Immortal which my ears can't bear to listen to again. Also Her voice is so scathingly annoying. I swear to God, after five minutes you're dying to hear yourself screaming just to drown it out. I'm not one of those people who only listens to American Idol winners but seriously- she can't sing.If you are thinking of buying this CD I would recommend not just sampling the clips. Find someone who owns it and listen to it all the way through. If you can stand it then you are stronger than me and who am I to judge you."
2,mediocre at best,"I have listened to this cd several times and while it does have its alright moments, most of the cd is given to highly synthesized pop-rock which I abhor. This band has proven to be one of the most mediocre followers of the gothic/ligh-getheseme sound. The splash that it has made in popular music rather proves my point.It's rather good for those who like Linkin Park and other bands of the sort though. I, unfortunately, was talked into the purchase of this cd. It did not appeal to my tastes but I don't doubt that it could very well appeal to others."
5,Early Sinead O Conner,"I picked this cd up because it had a cool cover...I was looking for something new & the guy at the store suggested it. After listening to this I fell in love with it. The music is not over produced. Instead, it is a refreshing raw edge laced around a powerhouse voice that has a distint sound reminiscent of early Sinead O Conner(The Lion & the Cobra.) Tracks 1-5 standout the most while the rest keeps you interested enough to keep on replay."
4,I love FALLEN!,"Evanesence is such an amazing band! They have combined the cool calming tones of such artists as Enya, or Sarah McLachlan, and combined it with a hip twist of Limp bizcuit, and Tool... They married the two genres beautifully to create something entirely new and original. Fallen expresses so many emotions it's nearly overwhelming. I love this cd because I can honestly say that I enjoyed all of the tracks, there was not one more interesting than another, I love that kind of uniform reflection in a cd, or anything for that matter. This album gave me goosebumps it was so good... give it a shot!"
2,Sounds the same.,Well what can I say? The whole album sounds the same except for MY IMMORTAL which has a different sound. If you heared BRING ME TO LIFE or GOING UNDER you've heard the whole album.Very overated. AVOID.
5,A cool Cd,I love this album.And I love the song Haunted.All the songs are so good.How could you dislike Amy Lee's voice.She has a cool voice.The lyrics are great and her vocals are great the band is great.So I guess its all good and dandy.Buy this CD first chance you get!Please give Evanescene a try..
2,one hit wonders,"i loved the song bring me to life and my immortal was okay until it became the most overplayed song ever but the rest of the cd all sonuds the same.everyone talked about how different and refreshing it is. so when i listened to it i expected a lot. and i was sorely dissapointed. this is not new or different. this has all been done before. depressoin has sold since nirvana, except that nirvana was awesome.and now that ben moody has gone solo evanessence is no more. this cd really isn't that great. i recommend you buy the singles instead."
2,Boring,"It really is a shame, because Evanescence has a lot of potential. When I first heard them on the radio, Amy Lee's vocals captivated me and their sound drew me in. When I listened to this album, I was sorely disappointed.You would do well in sticking to just a single because the album pretty much all sounds the same. It's as though they liked one song and decided to make the rest a slight variation of the first one they recorded.Furthermore, goth-rock you may be, but not everyone is so obssessed with the vampire mystique, and it seems every song here could apply to the undead. Been done before, and quite frankly, it's sort of boring and pretentious.Maybe they will evolve, and I hope they do, because Amy Lee can seriously sing, and hers is a distinct voice that deserves to be heard."
1,Music to kill yourself to..,"My wife purchased this album on the strength of the single 'Bring me back to Life'. I think I was able to make through 1 and 1/2 listens to this album before giving up.The music is fairly standard fare, with nothing special to offer the rock/metal scene. Bland, but inoffensive.The main gripe I have with the album is with Amy Lee's vocals. They come across as if she is trying to sound depressing and are completely mismatched with the music.If you want something that is going to be of the truly dark and depressed side of life, take a look at Paradise Lost or Anathema.If you are looking for nu metal with a twist, you may enjoy this album, provided you don't mind the fact that the music sounds like all the other nu metal bands out these days."
1,Very talented folks - but not my style,"I think this band has lots of great, valid, musical/artistic talent. Really and truly - the woman has an awesome voice, great piano-playing, drums, guitars, etc. However, I absolutely HATE the juxtaposition of the blurred rock guitar, the piano, and the high tone vocals - - it just sounds like a bunch of random crap thrown together. Just for the record - I am under 50, have very varied musical tastes, love female lead vocals, love rock, have over a decade of piano training, voice training, am no where near tone deaf, am scared of only very real threats (predators, natural disastors) to me or my son, and am not lying. So you could say I am a ""hater"" of this band, but I am not any of the things the previous posters have mentioned."
2,Great Potential,"Evanescence is all about contrast. Amy Lee's smooth voice over heavy, rock guitar riffs, with some piano and synthesizer just to keep you off-balance. Despite five million records, there is very little groundbreaking material on this record, just three good songs and filler. On the contrast theme, I do think Ms. Lee has a great voice. It's strong and powerful, but also very smooth and even silky at times. As far as the songwriting, Bring Me To Life is just a great song- I believe the record sold five million to date on the strength of that one song. It looks like there is some great potential here in the songwriting department; but it's not on this record. My advice: You've already heard the best songs on the radio. Save your money for next time- there is great potential here."
2,Yawn... This thing sends me to sleep,"This was an utter disappointment... There are so many repetitous songs on this album that it gives me deja vu. ""Didn't I just listen to this song?"" kind of thing. Bring Me To Life is the best song on the album (no surprise it was the first single) but Paul Maccoy contributes to this a lot. And the worst? There's a lot of competition there. Tourqinet has potential but never reached. Overall, it is just to slow... Not a catchy tune on the whole cd. Evanscence are trying to be deep and mysterious and it just doesn't work most of the time. Amy Lee's voice is far too soprano and grates like finger nails on a blackboard. She drags out every sylable and lyric like a funeral march. And the most annoying thing is that she never varies her voice (probably coz she doesn't have the ability) except on Going Under, which isn't really a great song anyway. If you want music to sleep to then evanscence will be your god-send."
4,"Good, but not new or original.","This is a decent album, even good at points, but this is nothing compared to Lacuna Coil, The Gathering, Within Temptation, Rhea's Obsession, Aghora, Collide, or Nightwish. Some believe this is the new direction of mainstream metal and maybe it is, but it's not new. Just new to the mainstream. If you like this, you will like the bands I named the same or probably more. Give them a chance if you really like Evanescence."
3,Lacuna Coil Knock-off???,"Can these guys sound any more like Lacuna Coil? Although the sound of a male and female lead singer IS unique and incredible, Lacuna Coil has been putting out music like that for years. It's amazing how similar the lead singers sound to Lacuna Coil, and the lead singer is trying as hard as she can to look like the lead singer from Lacuna Coil also. Anyone who truly enjoys this type of sound should do themselves a favor and check out the originators of this music...Lacuna Coil."
3,Could be better,"When I heard Bring Me to Life for the first time I loved it. The day ""Fallen"" came out, I rushed to the store and bought it, expecting a great record. Unfortunately, one listen was enough to tell me that although Amy Lee's voice is beautifully haunting, the song's aren't quite up to her potential. Basically, the songs would be great as singles, but when they're all together on one CD it's like hearing different variations of the same song over...and over...and over, with the exception of ""My Immortal"" and ""Hello"", which are both beautiful piano/vocal/strings arrangements. But then, looking at what I just wrote, I see that those songs are similar, musically, but to a lesser extent than that of the rest of the songs. I don't regret buying the CD - I do enjoy a listen every now and then, and Amy Lee really does make you wish you had her talent with piano and vocals - I just think Evanescence has the potential to be better than this."
3,"Good, Amy is excellent, but...","I have listened to this cd countless times, and enjoyed it. But, I have to say, Amy should leave the band and start her own cd. This cd is especially depressing. After listening to Tourniquet, I thought it was a good song. After looking up the lyrics, I was very depressed after hearing it again. I mean, is this all that these goth rock bands sing about? Their suicide? Yes, thats not all thats on the cd, but most of it has a saddened theme. If you dont believe that this cd is a depressing piece of work, look the word tourniquet up in the dictionary. Wow. I hope Amy doesnt commit suicide, she has such a beautiful voice..."
2,Better alternatives to Evanescence,"Forest Law, great job! I totally agree. :)Anyhow, for everyone else, if you're interested in female vocals, you should listen to some of these bands.More than likely, you'll put your Evanescence CD in the trash. In my opinion, they're not a _bad_ band; they're just average. I think most the following bands would be in the same genre and they have more talent.Lacuna CoilWithin TemptationTheatre of TragedyAfter ForeverNightwishTristaniaAnd for female vocals that resemble male vocals, we all love Arch Enemy"
5,A true reflection,"All true art acuratley reflects the human soul. For instance ""Hello"". The music is both lovley and alive. I would'nt call Evanescence a hardcore rock band, nor exactley Gothic, just a portral of what we won't say; not out loud."
4,Good but been done in Europe for years,"Don't get me wrong it's a great album, but it's not a new type of music as i see it get pinned so often. Listen to Lacuna Coil, The Gathering, Theater of Tradgey, Mortal Love, even throw in some Nightwish. Silent Cry, After Forever and more. If you Like Evanescence you'll like these bands and most of them have more the one album out, most have 3+ there all similar and have amazing female vocals. Like I said Evanescence is a great album, but don't say it's a new style."
5,"Powerful Vocals, Incredible Music!","Evanescence entered the scene in 2000 with their amazing debut album, ""Origin."" Since their first release, they have grown an incredibly distinct sound!Fallen is an amazing record! I have never heard a female vocalist with such a powerful voice! The guitars sound something similar to CKY (a heavy/gothic/alternative combination)! You will LOVE this album! It has been playing in my CD player nonstop since I got it! Stay offa' the P2P and support the band! It's only a few bucks - GO FOR IT! You'll LOVE EM'!"
3,Just a voice,"This c.d. was a great reminder of why I don't listen to or buy music that I first hear on the radio. A couple of really powerful songs with deep emotional core, and then... boredom. Boring guitars, melodies, drums, the piano is okay. Really, it just boils down to her voice (I gave it three stars because it's such a great voice), but other than that, it isn't very exciting. Maybe if they had a guitarist who dared to even attempt a decent solo. For my money, find a song by From Autumn To Ashes called Short Stories with Tragic Endings, a million times better than anything this band ever did"
3,"Good, but.......","I'm not too much into hard rock. On Fallen, I rather like some of the songs like ""Going Under,"" ""My Immortal,"" Taking Over Me,"" and a couple others. However, I find some of the lyrics, well..... disturbing. A bit too hard with the guitars on some songs. Otherwise, it's a good CD."
3,"A ""Gateway Drug""...","I must admit, when I first got this CD I absolutely loved it. I thought it was great, like nothing I had ever heard before. But then again, I rarely used to listen to music. Now, I rarely listen to this CD. It's almost difficult to differentiate between songs, and, I think, the slow songs are painful to listen to. And now Evanescence is way too mainstream. Everyone is going on about how phenomenal this group is and, frankly, I find it very annoying.But, this group is not all bad. Through Amazon.com's reccomendations i was able to find other, *better* bands like Lacuna Coil, Tristania, Nightwish, and Artrosis (which I *highly* recommend, providing you don't mind listening to Polish music, and you can actually get ahold of one of their CDs).That's basically it. If you like mainstream music, go with Evanescence. If you want something more beautiful, meaningful, and overall better, I recommend Nightwish, Artrosis, Tristania, and/or Lacuna Coil. Trust me, you won't regret it."
3,"Pretty good CD, but nothing spectacular.","I heard ""Bring Me To Life"" and thought it was pretty cool... the female vocals interested me. So I got the album (at a Christian store... before their whole 'denying they were a Christian band' thing) and I liked it. Some of the songs do sound similar and some of them are kinda boring, but there are a couple standout tracks where they go in different directions (""My Immortal"", ""Tourniquet"", and a few others). Overall the disc is pretty depressing and I couldn't listen to it for long periods of time. While the vocals sound pretty good on the CD, I've seen them live on MTV2 and she is not as good live. While the CD is good, it's too much of the same stuff (heavy riffs, haunting 'gothy' vocals) over and over."
3,"Okay,but kinda depressing","I bought this CD at Target one day thinking it would be your average alt. rock CD. The first 3 songs were good but then it started getting really depressing. Haunted was just..well..creepy. It's not a bad album but I just think it's a little melancholy for my taste. Amy Lee does have an amazing voice,though. And the CD definitely doesn't lack talent!(Though the guitars do get a little bland at times)"
2,Catchy but monotonic,"You hear one song, and tell yourself --- wow, I've got to hear more. Then you hear the second and you do a double take --- wait, is that the same song? Bottom line, all songs sound the same!"
2,"Unoriginal, Uninspiring, Annoying","What people don't seem to understand, is the Evanescence are NOT the ""breath of fresh air"" everybody thinks they are. They are a label-generated band, with label-generated music, that blatantly rip-off Lacuna Coil (who are one of the best and most talented bands in the world). Amy Lee's vocals are pitch-corrected, which is very obvious to anyone with basic knowledge of recording, and she sings from her throat, which makes everything sound nasaly. It's just annoying. Let's face it, Amy Lee is a 'goth' version of Britney Spears, and is only slightly more talented as a vocalist. If you want to hear real music, written by real musicians, with the most amazing frontwoman ever, listen to Lacuna Coil."
3,"Decent band, but uninspired lyrics.","Well this is a fairly decent corporate band and I admit, when I bought this CD years ago I kinda liked it. Since then I've discovered bands like Nightwish and Lacuna Coil. If you love operatic female leads then you should try the 2 aforementioned bands. Heed this people, Evanescence is Nu-metal band using simple riffs that take little talent to accomplish. All I have to say is prepare for the power of hardcore and metalcore and the resurgence of real metal. For this band to be called metal is a disgrace."
2,"Bad cover art, by the way.....","No big deal, no great innovation as people keep saying... this is a blend between nu-metal and gothic, and it's really boring."
4,wow,"when i first heard this band, i really liked them. i didn't buy the album, though, until i got to school. people raved about the cd, and i was forced to get it. i even let my mom listen to it, and to my surprise, she liked it. the lead vocal is amazing. she HAS to have been very well trained, not just some person they picked up off the street. and if you just listen to the music, it's amazing. it's my favorite study music now. i highly recommend this album, even with the overhyping. sometimes, things are just worth it..."
4,Misunderstood,"I detest reviewers who base their knowledge of a band strictly on what the radio plays. ""Bring Me to Life"" fits what it was designed to fit, it brought Wind-Up Records the fame for two of its artists, and breathed life into the movie ""Daredevil."" It was something that fit an empty niche on the radio, and was subsequently all that played in that niche.The rest of the album, however, is much more artful and incredible. Epic in scope and premise, and it fits Amy's image perfectly (seductive but foreboding). By now ""Going Under"" has been no doubt their second single, and perhaps it will change your opinion slightly, but it doesn't defer away from the common radio-rock enough to be my final example. Songs ""Tourniquet"", ""Taking Over Me"", ""Haunted"", ""Imaginary"", and ""My Last Breath"" are dark and complex.I do agree, they do have room to grow, but I don't think they're going to be stuck in the niche their first big single put them into for long."
5,WOW! I'm in love.,"So I was driving in the car when I first heard ""Bring me to Life""...and I was BLOWN away. Hard rock sound and a gorgeous melody provided by Amy Lee's vocals....with tag-team help from McCoy.I can't get enough of this cd.We FINALLY have a new band w/ enormous potential for longevity.Thus far, and by far, the best tracks are ""Bring me to life"", ""My Immortal"", ""Haunted"", ""Imaginary"", ""Taking Over Me"", ""My Last Breath"" and ""Whisper"".Hell, the entire cd is amazing.Hell....AMY IS HOTTTTTTT.BTW, in case you wondered, at the end of ""Whisper"", the choir is singing verses from the movie ""The Omen"".....which is ironic being that this band is quite Christian.DJ FreakE(djfreake4u@yahoo.com)"
5,Amazingly powerful...,"I haven't been this hooked on an album, or group, in years. I went on a search to download some of their songs after my sister had mentioned to me that I might be able to relate to some of the music by this new group, and I was amazed at what I found. I have had ""Fallen"" in my CD player since I purchased it in April (and have since purchased 2 more copies because I seem to wear them out!), and I am still not sick of listening to it. Amy Lee's voice is absolutely incredible, giving even more impact to the already powerful lyrics in all of these songs, and the music the band provides delivers a complete package of honest, sorrowful, deep rock. I would recommend this album to anyone who is looking for something to relate to in life, because it's bound to be found somewhere in these amazing songs!"
5,Awesome CD,"This cd is one of the best I've heard in awhile. Most cds have a few good songs, I love all the songs on this one.. It's a must buy!"
4,"Textured music, accomplished musicianship.","Evanescence approaches its music and songwriting with a degree of seriousness and care that's none too common these days. The songs are aggressive yet catchy, with an ear for build and drama; Amy Lee's vocals are arresting, beautiful yet with a hard edge, especially exhilarating when she soars into her upper register, and Ben Moody's guitar crunch provides excellent counterpoint to her melodic voice. Lyrics are intelligent and flowing, not just sulking for sulking's sake, with a distinct spiritual edge which enriches their thematic palette.As worthy as the last major album in this style, A Perfect Circle's excellent debut album. Lee and Moody's approach to their craft are truly heartening and I'm sure I'll be following their music for years to come."
3,A bit of background,"The irony is, I've been pushing Evanscence for about 3 years now....First heard them on mp3.com, and then with the album Origin. Fallen, while it was good, was a bit of a let-down to be honest. It's only real improvement is Whisper, which is a fantastic renovation of the original. Tourniquet is a good song, but holds nothing on the Soul Embraced original song (although I suppose most people don't dig the death metal-at least the guitarist from Soul Embraced is in Evanescence now..) See if you can get your hands on Origin on ebay, it's twice as good as Fallen easily."
5,Originality counts!!!!,"The best rock. Unlike anything you have ever heard, no they do not sound like the swirling figs like you thought. not true. Allman brothers? perhaps but not swirling figs."
2,"decent, but reminds me of a better band...","...which is called Lacuna Coil. I've been a fan of Lacuna Coil for a couple of years now. I found out about Evanescense from someone on LC mailing list. When I heard Evanescense, first thing that struck me is that it's very similar to LC. Still, LC is a better band. Cristina puts more feeling into her singing, and the musuc itself is heavier and richer.To summarize, Evanescense sounds like a watered-down version of Lacuna Coil, adapted for general audience and more radio friednly.Seriously folks, check out Lacuna Coil (either Comalies or Unleashed Memories album), and you will thank me later."
1,Turn it off - pleeeeeeeeese,"I guess it takes all tastes and vive la difference and all that but I agree with MR. ""4 stars?!? You guys are nuts!!!"" Apart from tempo variations every track sounded like the last - Bloody 'orrible like someone pounding on a dumpster with a large hammer and someone inside moaning to be let out."
1,Cher with guitars,"Thats how accurately I can describe the sound. Amy Lee, whos voice is probally THE most manufactured and overrated in the music industry, croaks her way through some of the most vile, bland, tearfully bad ""music"" that undoubtely will attract more than its fair share of slimy fat goths, who, ironically, have skin as pale as Amy Lees on the cover.Want metal with great vocals? Try Iced Earth, Iron Maiden, and Opeth, and go out and get some sun for a change."
1,Evanescence- Fallen,"This CD sucked she can not sing at all. I mean my sister loves it as 4 me i'll stick with Usher and Missy Elliot. But then again I'm the all-star Cheerleader not the one who wears black clothes on a 90 dergree day. If u have any comments please write HOT CHICK 2004 in your review so i know 2 read it, im not going 2 read any rewiews that dont envolve ME. Got it good. Write me. (Actully I'm her little sister I'm just using her name.)"
2,What?,"I heard Evanescence was a Christian band and my (Christian) school did a human video to Bring Me To Life and I really liked the song, so I checked out the lyrics to some of there songs including Bring Me To Life. I was shocked. There were so many lyrics that I didn't understand when she was singing that when I read... Oh my gosh. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because they have a really great band. But the messages are so dark and depressing it's almost haunting. I am a devoted Christian and don't want to fill my mind with depressing thoughts. Don't buy this CD."
1,The lead singer needs a councelor,"with all the money this band is gonna make from 12 yr olds, i think they should buy a lot of anti depressent medicine. and if the kids that buy this album have any money left over, buy some your self, because your gonna need them. this music just makes people bored and depressed, i some people havent heard real music."
1,Most overated band since Good Charlotte,"Ok, at least the crtics knows this CD sucks, I mean, they are just a wannabe Linkin Park, and they suck at it.If I wanna listen to an opera song ill go to an opera, I dont want to hear this non sense on a rock station...."
4,I like what I've heard,"I first heard their two songs on the Daredevil soundtrack,and quite liked them.I haven't got or heard the album,but just for those who like Amy Lee's vocals but consider the music over-produced/samey/rubbish,then really check out Sarah McLaughlan-she sounds almost identical to Amy Lee but mellower-in fact when I heard the song in Daredevil,I thought it was Sarah McLaughlan.I'll give what I've heard 4 stars,but I can't really pass judgement on the whole album,as I've only heard Bring Me To Life,Tourniquet and My Immortal.Probably the right mix of loudness and melody,but could it a bit produced."
4,Stopped dead in my tracks...,"Okay... Here's the background. I'm a progressive rock dinosaur, walking through Tower Records in Yokohama, looking for something they did not have (Karnataka). Suddenly, this music comes over the store's speaker system. It rocked, and suddenly, this unspeakably gorgeous voice comes through the mix like a searchlight through the inky darkness... I stopped dead in my tracks, and after finding out who it was, immediately bought it... I may never find the Karnataka, but this was really good. I'd recommend it highly, and hope to see another release from this band. This would be a strange recommendation, but here goes: IF you recall Grace Slick's voice fondly, and have not already gotten too old to appreciate the new Rock, then you will enjoy this! Buy it, turn it up, share it with the neighbors!"
5,Captivating!,"This is the best album i have bought in the last 20 years! i now have bought 3 copies! it is hard to explain, but i must hear the captivating voice of Amy Lee over and over, the music and lyrics hit you in the face and in your heart and soul,i cannot listen to this CD without having a box of tissues.unbelievable! i can't wait for their next album."
2,Wish I would've passed,"Dont get me wrong, Evanescence is a good band, they just need to make better songs...Going under, tourniquet, and haunted are the only songs that interested me. I'd like it to be a little bit louder but thats just me and im a Marilyn Manson fan. But my friends loved it."
4,"Put this under the ""Guilty Pleasure"" category","At last count, there are 588 reviews of this on Amazon, so what can I, a ""serious music lover"" add to this? A different perspective perhaps, which adds up to ""guilty pleasure"", nothing more, nothing less.Evanescence has come out of nowhere, really. Two tracks on last year's ""Daredevil"" soundtrack has caused all the buzz, and now we have their debut album, which is a mix of ""goth"" tracks such as the terrific ""Going Under"" and ""Bring Me to Life"" and ballads such as ""My Immortal"" and ""Hello"". The thing that catches me are the rocking tracks, with Ben Moody's catchy guitar hooks. Amy Lee's vocals are outstanding as well throughout.Do I think that Evanescence will make a lasting impact on the music scene? I doubt it, frankly. But ""Fallen"" is a thouroughly enjoyable listen all the way through. What a guitly pleasure!"
5,Evanescence - Not your normal everyday music,"I'm usually the type of person who like pop music for the dancing. I'm not into a lot of heavy bands with loud drums, etc. When I first heard Bring Me to Life I was hooked. The whole entire CD is amazing and I'm definately waiting for new or old music from them. Her voice is so incredible and then with the sound of a bad with her voice just gives me chills it is so great. How someone ever came up with such a great combination surprises me I would never imagine a group this great. If you've even looked at the CD I know you are thinking about purchasing it, just do it."
5,Whats not 2 luv???,"Okay, lets just say this... whats not to love?!?!?! now thats out just want to say this is my all time FAVORITE cd and always will be. amy (lead singer) has an awesome voice. guitars provide perfect background and my favorite songs are Tourniquet (moving lyrics and great rock song, but also with a hint, but not too much Christian inspiration) and Taking Over Me ( again great lyrics and story we probably can all relate to, also great guitars)Fallen definitely provides the right amount of rock, powerful and inspirational lyrics, it should be #1 on every one's shopping list or always be in the stereo or cd player! Can't wait til next CD! ROCK ON AMY!"
1,Crappity Crap,"My friend put this on when I was over his house. After it came on, I barely noticed it was on after that because its so bland and unoriginal..."
1,BAHHHHH!!!!!! MAKE IT STOP!!,"This music sucks, when i hear the singers voice I want to strangle her to make it stop. The vocals sounds like a girl driving in a car trying to sing a song on the radio. What a useless band."
1,OMFG.,"Since when is ""Evanescence"" is good band? I don't think they even deserve to be called, because they pretend to be hardcore rockers, but in reality they're just whiny sissies who are no more rock than the song ""If you're happy and you know it"". If everyone smashed c.ds like this, then it would be a perfect world. But they don't, they just keep living their stupid mockery lives, and get married and have children. And those of you who call yourselves ""goth"" and listen to Evanescence make me sick. My current and standing opinion is: There is no help for this world. I am disgusted."
1,Mindless drivel,"The only reason anyone likes this band is because they have a female vocalist who sings well. Subtract her from the equation, and they sound EXACTLY like every other lame metal band trying to revive the sound of the mid-eighties. Seriously, you can hear this crap being played in hundreds of garages in Jersey by high school students."
1,Total Junk,"Lead singer Amy Lee's incescent howling and bellowing of these mainstream, over-commercialized lyrics and generic riffs, proves once again that good music in today's Rock-Alternative Genre is indeed hard to find. If I could, I would give this CD -3 stars. Horrid beyond words can describe. Within a year, this band will thankfully be forgotten. The band's ready-made goth look only adds to debachery and rancid fluff of commercial rock. (...)heheheh..Ladies and Gents..the modern day spinal tap is Evanescence. The reasons would be too long and many why you should avoid this album, but let me sum it up for you..if you have any creativity whatsoever, and enjoy good original tunes in the alternative rock genre, go with a band like Dredg. It's a fresh sound, and it has soul. If you like commercial pop you will probably like this album, and will probably be on your way to buy the new Linkin Park CD as well.. if thats your thing, then fine, but I'll choose my own music, thank you."
2,More Like Fallen from a Building,"Evanescence has been over-exposed, over-played, and is now deemed under-talented. While the vocals are rich and harmonious, the songs are not truly original. I fear for the sophomore attempt."
4,Amy Lee CAN sing!,"Everybody has their own taste in music, but not everybody has an ear for music. I happen to like this CD a lot, and I understand that some people won't, but to say that Amy Lee can't hold a note? ""Mare"", get a clue! Amy Lee has one of the best voices in pop or rock or goth (or whatever label you want to put on it) to come around in a long time. I've seen them live and I was impressed with her talent."
3,Something if just not right.......,"The band could compentiently play, the singer has an amazing voice, but the combined, something just didn't seem right. Maybe its just the associations not normally made with that style of singer and music. Unique definately, but not catching on with me. Also, from an audiofiles perspective, the recording was fair at best with lack of depth and additional noice picked up when microphones were turned on during the track. Purely from that perspective, I was very dissapointed. I expected to a recording with much better quality, but unfortunatly it doesn't do it justice."
5,Fallen into Bliss,I dont know much about this group except that they have tricks up there sleeves with a mellow almost hypnotic beginning to there songs and a hard edge for the finale I love this group and cant wait to hear more from them in the future
5,Evanescence is here to stay,"This album is absolutely amazing. Amy Lee's voice is hauntingly powerful and unique. Although the songs tend to be a bit formulaic, this is not just your average death/goth CD. Every song will get stuck in you head, but because of how good they all are, you won't mind. Some of the best songs are ""Going Under,"" ""Bring Me to Life,"" ""Tourniquet,"" and ""My Immortal."" You may not like the songs on the first listen, but as you listen more, the songs get better and better. I have no doubt that Evanescence is here to stay, and you should have no doubts about buying this CD. You will not regret it."
3,"A couple of good radio tracks, the rest is filler","This disc is refreshingly different from much mainstream rock, and has several good tracks. Unfortunately, the best tracks off of this disc have been played over, and over, and over again on radio, and television. So if you watch tv or listen to the radio you've already heard most of what this disc has to offer.The three quality songs on this album are: Going under, Bring me to life (both played seemingly continuously on the radio the past several months), and tourniquet (which is a good track, but sounds quite a bit like the first two mentioned.)It's not a terrible disc - the three songs mentioned above are GOOD songs, but beyond that the album doesn't have anything else to offer. So if you have a radio, you really don't need this cd."
2,Metal?,"I don't think so. I can't believe people actually listen to this and say ""Yeah this stuff is hard as hell."" This stuff is so far from being hard or real metal it's not even funny. I'll give the chick credit though. She has a good voice, and is a very good singer, that's why I gave this album 2 stars instead of 1, but people, this stuff is not metal. If you think you're a metal head by listening to this type of music you're sadly mistaken. If you want to hear some real metal that makes this band sound as soft as the Spice Girls listen to Slayer, Kreator, Cradle of Filth, or old Metallica. That is what metal is."
3,"Not bad, but nothing new","Take all the ""kewl"" things from popular music and mix them into one band. Crunchy, if uninspired, alt metal riffs, a touch of electronica-style synth and effects, angry pseudo-rap chants and an emotive female singer, some toned-down piano lines and cello for authenticity, and voila!It's catchy, entertaining, but don't be expected for any outrageously creative songwriting. Although, they do have the potential to become important."
5,Fallen Best CD Purchase of the Year,"This CD is just awesome! At first I wasn't sure about it, not really liking female lead vocals, but this CD totally changed my mind! It's incredible and would highly recommend!"
3,ehh..,She has a grrrreat voice and the music is good...but the lyrics...suckIts almost as if she's...trying to sound depressed.Kinda artificial words. But its still decent music I guess.
2,Wake up!,"I give two stars only because the lead singer has a decent voice. Besides that this is cookie cutter modern rock. How long is everyone going to let Clear Channel and MTV force feed these overhyped , overproduced bands down your throats before you start demanding something original???"
3,a good attempt at goth metal,"while citing lacuna coil is completely legitmate saying lacuna are exponentially better songwriters is just plain wrong.simplistic backing music is an important part of goth metal so the incredible vocals shine through. lacuna coil write with more of a metal influence while evanescence have more of a nu-metal (linkin park a good example) approach.i'll be the first to speak out when an american band is doing a poor job of emulating a european style (a good example being darkest hour biting at the gates) but evanescence ARE doing an outstanding job.this is not the greatest cd since sliced bread but if you like lacuna coil or theatre of tragedy you will most likely enjoy this. simple but catchy music and dramatic, beautiful vocals...."
5,Amy Lee,"The first time I heard the ""My Immortal""I could not stop listening to it. I still play it over and over again. I never get sick of the song. The Songmakes me cry. The words are so deep andthe meaning is so real. Amy will go far andI hope the world will appreciate her angelic voiceif they haven't heard her yet."
5,"AWESOME, A VOICE UNLIKE ANYTHING I'VE EVER HEARD!!!","This is an incredible daunting album. The Vocalist is just amazing!!! Lyrics and the arrangment of instruments were put together with a true creativeness that you just can't find in today's ""proper"" music...THIS BAND WILL BE AROUND FOR A LONG TIME!!!"
2,Disappointed,"I got this CD because I loved their radio hits ""Bring Me To Life"" and ""My Immortal."" While those songs are beautiful, they are not representative of the rest of the album. Although I tried and tried to get into this CD, the hard rock teen goth style just isn't my cup of tea, and the lyrics are too depressing. If you are a fan of bands such as Linkin Park or Seether, you might enjoy this. However, if you only like ""My Immortal"" and ""Bring Me To Life"" because of Amy's powerful vocals, you'd be better off listening to Tori Amos or Sarah McLachlan."
3,What's all the fuss?,"Having heard all the raves, I had to listen. The album is somewhat better than average, but really no more than that. Apparently several tracks have received a lot of radio play and therefore have become stuck in a lot of people's heads: thus, the popularity. To me, all the upbeat tracks sound the same. On random play, it would be hard to tell which one was playing. Amy Lee is obviously talented. She is pitch perfect and manages a pleasing tone on the ballads, but she could stand some voice lessons to get the pinched quality out of her voice on the more intense songs. The lyrics are sometimes interesting, sometimes just dark. Maybe this group's next album will contain more variety."
2,meh,"when i was 'goth' i hated them for trying ot be goththen i decided to make a channge in my life, i had a new girl, i was happy, so i bought neww clothes and got a new attitude towards lifeso i decided to try out some old cds laying around and i saw this and i thought hey, i never gave it a shot, why notbut alas..i hate them even more cuz theyre songs are generic boring and bland *redundancy needed*im glad they broke upoh yeah, i gave it 2 stars cuz her voice is amazing"
5,faLLen,"GOING UNDER - 5/5...kickaxxBRING ME TO LIFE - 5/5...self-explanitory.EVERYBODYS FOOL - 4/5...have NO idea why this is the new single but whatever.MY IMMORTAL - 4/5...doesnt evoke as much emotion as the Band Version does but its still good.HAUNTED - 5/5...best song on the record HANDS DOWNTOURNIQUET - 5/5...beautiful. i wish they got darker and more goth than this but its still great. nice lyrics, guitars, emotion. wonderfulIMAGINARY - 5/5...amy what were you smokin when you wrote this?TAKING OVER ME - 3/5...too pop and too much of a filler for me.HELLO - 5/5...TOTALLY redeems the ""fallen"" effort of Taking Over Me with a deep, moving piano ballad. Amazing.MY LAST BREATH - 4/5...ehh.. yeah whatever so so song.WHISPER - 5/5...kickaxx way to end the record. great great great!except the tribal guys at the end...what the fxxx is up with that??"
5,Genius,"Genius, absolute. Restored my faith in music. Not one filler on it.Its makes u cry(My Immortal), it makes u rock(Haunted).If you don't like this, you are already dead.This girl must have sold her soul to the devil for this voice.Will take you places you didn't know existed.Nuff said."
5,One of my essential albums,"I surprised myself by buying this album--I am a die-hard classic rock fan who rarely listens to anything made after the 1970s (even though I wasn't born then). Evanescence is not the sort of band I normally listen to, but I have to tell you that I couldn't be without this CD. Amy Lee's vocal talent is obviously the first thing to mention--Lee's incredibly captivating, powerful voice is at once a contrast and an accompaniment to the surprisingly polished, heavy guitar riffs of Ben Moody and the instrumental work of the rest of the band. The lyrics are dark but addicting, and I often find myself unable to get any number of the album's tracks out of my head. I love every song on this album, but ""Going Under"" ""Everybody's Fool"" ""Haunted"" and ""Tourniquet"" are my favorites. Even if you're not a fan of this genre, give this album a shot--it'll surprise you and leave you eager for more from this band from Arkansas."
4,If Sarah Mclachlan went Goth,"and dyed her hair dark colors and wore flowy dark clothes, she would be this bands singer. Thats not to say that her voice isnt hauntingly beautiful. The best cuts are when Amy is singing with just the piano- very gripping stuff. File this CD under the Makeout music. Or Makeout music for goths. Gorgeous instrumenting and a nice mix. I would not say its one of those ""its got a beat and you can dance to it"" compilations, but its still a damn good cd."
3,Fallen~Evanescence,"This CD has a few good songs that you can also listen to on the Daredevil soundtrack but if your not the type of person that want's to listen to lyrics of pain and sorrow, I would'nt recomend this CD cause most of the songs are of that tragic type. Over all though Evanescence won't be a total waste of time and money if you decided to buy it."
2,Review Written April 2003 [Hence The Creed Reference],"""Dude, did you hear that rock is dead?"" ""No kidding, man? That sucks!"" ""Yeah I know, except for Linkin Park, not much is selling these days."" ""Dude, what about Metallica?"" ""Nah, I mean that rap/rock combination!"" ""Oh, right."" ""And where the hell has Sarah McLachlan been?"" ""Ew, dude, who cares!?"" ""Well, yeah, but the record industry is in the dumpster...sales are in a slump, downloading is at its peak, radio sucks...it's all corporate, man, and it stinks! Ya know you're in hell when Creed is the biggest selling rock band in the world!"" ""And they're Christian-rock!"" ""Yeah, nothing worse than Christian rock!"" ""Yeah!"" ""Dude, what's next? Christian Rock with a metal-edge and quasi-Goth wardrobe and a Sarah wannabe gurgling some pretentious lyrics about life and love and death and being saved and blah blah blah!?"" ""HAHA! Yeah! Then what? Denying that you're a Christian band? Hahahaha!!!! Who would they think they are, U2?"" ""Ha ha ha!"" C-"
1,"and now,a public service announcement","big tobbacco is no longer enemy #1!the new threat to public health is nu-metal,and evenscance just happens to be leading this ""march of the idiots""!oh,yes-they'll try to lure you in with such intelligently powerfull words as ""heavy"",""melodic"",or"" my personal favorite ""genre-bending""!you must strive to be more than a billboard number,my friends!look up bands like Down,Tool,Sigur Ros,corrosion of conformity,angelo badalamenti,soulfly,sepultura,and Atmoshere to get those creative juices flowing again!"
1,And i thought the wiggles were bad i`m wrong,This band has no class whatsoever this album can be learn`t in a day easily its that simple.We have a female vocalist who sounds as if she hasn`t had her period guiarists who make recorders sound like a pleasanat sound and the drums this band must of found him in the junk mail in their letterbox.yes if your a loser this is for you and don`t wear a loser top if you listen to this band society will spot you.
1,Annoying,This cd is very very annoying. The singers shrill shrieks almost make my glasses shatter. The group just goes on and on about morbid dumb things. I think Evanescence should go back to playing at Bar Mitzvas.
2,....,"People are over rating them as a band. People are now trying to promote any band that has somehting new or different. I simply look at the music, i pay no attention to the fact that this is a nu-metal band with a female singer... and I see them as being similar to all of the other nu-metal linkin park type bands out there. However, I believe that Linkin Park are better than this band.I'm sure many will disagree, but if you enjoy music that doesn't just use a head banging beat and catchy chorus to gain a fanbase... I do not believe you should pay attention to this band.Overall, though, they aren't terrible, I just believe that they have gotten very over rated."
1,Suicidal Junk,"I hate this CD. Its a collection worthless, whiny, ""Oh poor me"" songs. I don't hate all depressing songs, but this Amy Lee chick can't even sing. It drives me insane. I HATE THIS CD!!!!"
1,"So, when is the next fad showing up?","15 minutes is up, Evanescence we'll see you on vh1's where are they now in about 10 years. If you like this you have no taste. This is mainstream and this fails. Amy Lee is cocky and arrogant, she trys to act underground and angsty but she has more money than I can imagine. Only one kind of girl looks up to somebody as pathetic as her. The cliche ""goth"" girls ranging 12-17 because this kind of music can totally relate to the pain of growing up in suburban america, don't forget to keep cutting yourselves to relieve all your mental anguish, ladies! Look at rock these days, now look at rock a decade ago. The difference is disgusting, while mtv had some credability left then, it is all but gone now. Go ahead, disagree with me, I could care less. Listen to some real music and then we can talk. Avoid this like the plague."
1,Lame,"This is pop music. It's pop music with guitars. The little pop-loving children will go out and but it, and think, yeah, I'm a rocker. I'm into metal music. No, you're not. You like Evanesence because of the label that goes with it. You want rock? Try something that isn't manufactured pop metal. Something with a bit of integrity, because in two weeks, you'll have forgotten they ever existed."
1,ITS DRIVING ME INSANE!!!!!,i hate this band this cd doesn't even deserve 1 star (amazon made me rate it) i listened to their album (im glad i didn't buy it) i couldnt tell when the song changed it all sounds the same the lyrics SUCK they remind me of Coldplay they suck too evenesance's cd is just on really long song it put me to sleep its overplayed and it sickens me Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!
1,I hate this band.,"This band is terrible, the vocals are so annoying. Just another overated band, just like that band of pansies, Linkin Park. If you want good music get Pink Floyd: Dark Side of the Moon, or if your a metal head get Tool's: Lateralus, or Aenima."
1,Garbage,Join SOG because SOG is a cool clan. SOG stands for Survivors Of Girls. if you really hate this band then you should pick up Some Snoop Dogg Records. Snoop Dogg is a real band and so is Dr Dre. Snoop Dogg can really put up a show because their vocalist and their guitarist is really good. LOL!!!!!!!!!
3,Only Half Quality,"The first half of this album is descent quality modern rock, but thats it. The second half seems like one long dragged out song. There aren't any significant beats or rythyms that makes this album stand out above anything else today. I would probly reccomend this to a 16 year old teen girl that enjoys rock, the audience doesn't span that much farther."
5,"Spooky, Cool, and Full of Rock!","This is one of the best CD's I own thanks to it's blended mix of everything from soft piano tracks(My Immortal), to the hardest rockyou can get(Bring me to Life). It even has a song that would creep you out if you were alone(Haunted). I reccomend this CD to anyone who has the money to spend and a good reason."
4,Blue Print for better things to come,"This first release fron Evanescence shows a band yet in the making. This bands sounds remaninds me of a few progressive metal bands but with nu metal qualities and Goth like sounds. This is in no sense a put down on the band, on the contrary is great to hear new mainstream music with such a powerful performance. On this recording tha bands sounds relies on the powerful and opera like voice on their female singer (Amy Lee) and the heavy distorted guitar sond of Ben Moody.By looking at the booklet I get the impression that Evanenescence is really a duo and not yet a full band as Lee And Moody take credits for performing, writting and producing the album. It will be very interesting to see where this band will go on their next recording"
5,Better in concert.,"I was drawn to evanescence when they began to be played on the radio with ""Bring Me To Life"".A woman at work bought the cd,heard it,and was blown away!I bought it myself,and couldn't stop playing the whole cd(sometimes except ""haunted"").I had a chance to see them in concert.Amy Lee just draws you in with her voice which is as strong in person as it is on the cd.I usually listen to hip hop,but this cd has so much to offer as far as deep lyrics,great background,and haunting strings,I couldn't pass it up.In summary,buy the...thing!"
5,Speachless....,"I have to say that I've been REALLY bored with music these days, feeling like everyone sounds like everyone else. THIS is exactly what I've been waiting for. It's Sarah McLaughin gone goth and it sounds incredible. Amy Lee has one of the most amazingly powerful, hypnotic, haunting and addicting voices I've ever heard. I didn't want to turn the CD off."
5,Best rock band,"I have to admit, I really wasn;t too much of a fan of modern rock music. I liked the oldies like The Beatles and pop, but after borrwing this cd from my friend, I discovered how much I like it. The best songs would have to be ""Bring me to life"", ""My Immortal"", ""Going Under"" , ""Everybody's Fool"", ""Haunted"" and ""Tourniquet"". When you put this cd on, you will get the urge to rock out just like Amy Lee does. Her voice is fantastic and gives you the emotion of the song. I can't wait until they release their new record. I will defnitaley by it!"
2,well at least a couple of songs are good,"This band has amazing lyrics.Amy Lee has a wonderful voice.But the main problem is:Almost all of these songs sound exactly the same.""My Immortal"" and ""My Tourniquet"" are the only songs I actually like.Wonderful lyrics,really.But it just sounds too much alike.Not worth it."
5,Fallen is incredible...,"Evanescence is best described as a beautiful blend of rap-metal and heartfelt sorrow; Amy Lee's vocals are an incredible asset to their overall sound, and their guitarists, Ben Moody and John LeCompt, help create that harsh, jagged sound that meshes well with Amy's otherworldly voice. Definitely worth the money."
5,"a definite ""worth it"" buy",Evanescence is a band that has literally exploded into the music industry. I heard about them one day and the next day they had escalated to tying as my #1 band (with Kutless as the other #1). I can't recommend this group highly enough.
5,It's nice to hear a woman sing lead in a hard metal group,"With bands like Dave Matthews, Matchbox 20, Nickleback and Disturbed achieving prominance on the airwaves, here comes this unknown band from a town that's probably known for its contributions to country music. With haunting and melodic vocals, experimental harmonies, brilliant instrumentation and hard guitar riffs, this is an album that will appeal to a variety of listeners. The album is dark, repleat with angst and despair. As a result, some of the songs would make a perfect backdrop to an Anne Rice novel. Evanescence is one of best musical talent to come along in a while. My only beef with ""Fallen"" is that all the songs are played in the same minor key, which leads one to believe that all 11 songs are variations on the same theme. I'd like to hear some different styles toyed with on their next album."
2,A Big Disappointment,"I first borrowed this cd from a friend after hearing ""Bring me to Life"", which I admit, was a good song. But after listening to the whole cd I quickly realized that every song on this cd sounds the same. You have your ballads and you have all the other songs that sound somewhat like ""Bring me to life"". Its really not worth buying, and I'm glad I didn't spend any money to listen to this cd."
2,Boring,"The ingredients for success are here, particularly in the powerful voice of the lead singer. Unfortunately, there's little that is new or interesting in the music. Frankly, the ""woe-is-me"" gothic darkness thing is tiresome and shockingly immature from this group who are no longer teens. Fascinating how their target audience has swallowed the bait, though. Certainly these tunes are preferable to the pre-packaged, programmed pop singers of today. But these songs aren't really any deeper or better; they merely have a different shade of surface gloss."
4,Obsession with Death,"One reviewer said that Evanescence seems to have an obsession with death. I think if I had grown up in Arkansas, I'd probably want to die too."
3,3 and 1/2 but they seemed to limit it to just whole numbers,"The lyrics make up for the lack of guitar riffs and whatever, but I wanna know what they're like live so I can see if I have misjudged the kinda calmness of this album.(I saw Pilate live, man they rock so much harder then their album). ANYWHO back to the review. this cd is pretty good, I'm not a die hard evanescence fan or anything like that but I still enjoy the cd, its not my fav but whatever some good listening on here, but it all depends on taste.(I like lots of different kinds of music from soad-pennywise-John Mayer-Outkast)ANYWHO lol sorry the lyrics are poetic,however the context of them a lil repetitive ( u no, depression, anti-gimmick typathing)And Amy lee's voice is refreshing sorta but her n Ben Moody I think don't really give their band much credit. ""Evanescence"" might aswell just be called ""amy Lee"". but watever. all in all i'd say maybe an 8 or 7.5 out of 10."
4,Refreshing,"I bought this album because I like Nightwish. It was cheap on the walmart shelf so i picked it up. I actually like this alot more than I ever expected. It's true, the songs are somewhat repetative, and the nu metal-mess of the riffs is quite obvious. But other than those few things i really enjoy this album. It has a lot of great individual songs on it. The one star reviews are being a bit harsh on the downsides of the album. Amy Lee has a very beautiful voice and the piano and strings on the album are very good. Its obvious that the music is directed toward being commercially successful, but hell.. why not? If you like female fronted bands I think you really need to have this album, even thow it leans more towards the popish sound. If not, then mabey should should look elsewhere, because i cant see anyone listening this for just the guitar or something."
5,fallen,"FallenWell i don't have to say much but agree with the rest of ppl who said this album is great, except one thing, this album isn't great but perfect, simply, love it."
5,I Love Amy Lee's Voice!!!,"I bought this CD a few weeks ago, and I really like it! For starters, I love Amy Lee's singing voice! It's beautiful, awesome, sexy, and scary all together! My favorite songs so far are Going Under, and Bring Me To Life! I highly recommend FALLEN!!!"
1,BLAH!,"Can you say over powering? Lay off on the 'urgency' as another reviewer mentioned. Too earnest and power chord-y. Vocals I guess are ok, unique but sort of wants to make you claw your ears out after just one song...too much! This is not really innovative as everyone raves about, it's just nu-metal with estrogen."
4,very cool band,evanescence's fallen rox overall but wats up with those songs 'my immortal' and 'hello'?? this chick has the most awesome voice and the band rox. is this a rock band or jewel?? every other track on this album rox except these two. and have u seen that video for 'bring me to life'...damn that thing sux!! this band has a cool sound if only they used it right.
3,I know something way better,"A good friend of mine told me about this Indiana hard rock band caled ""Fiber"" whose got a black female guitarist. He said they were similar to this, but I've got to say that I loved Fiber much more. They were just so raw and full of energy that it reminded me of why I started playing music in the first place![...]"
3,"Pretty Good, But Nothing Special!!!","Overall, I think this is a pretty good CD, particularly by nu-metal/mainstream rock standards. Amys voice is very strong on the CD, and the lyrics are suprisingly very good as well. But the band behind her leaves a lot to be desired. The guitar, drums and bass are nothing technical or hard, and they tend to stay with very simple riffs and music...this CD tends to be more ""The Amy Lee Show"" than it does Evanescence. But a big problem I have with Evanescence is that Amy really cant cut it live. On the CD she sounds great, but the sounds very bad in concert. Cristina from Lacuna Coil and Tarja from Nightwish are both MUCH better singers than her, and they have good bands behind them. But overall, if you listen to Lacuna Coil or Nightwish, you wont get any satisfaction out of this, but if youre into mainstream rock this is something Im sure youll like."
1,Doesn't withstand multiple re-listens,"When I first heard this album, all I could think was ""wow, her voice is so beautiful! I've never heard anything like it!"" Once I got used to her singing, though, it became grating. She uses the same handful of high, drawn out belting notes over and over and rarely mixes things up by going into her low range or high operatic range. The songs start to blend together. The only song I enjoy now is ""Going Under."" The rest are just too boring."
1,This CD is mutha ****in' Gansta!,"Me and ma home girls get down to this every time we roll the clubs. That rap in ""Bring Me to Life"" is gangsta. And this cover is so bling-bling."
1,JUST iv'e fALLEN 4 this...,"Man on man! Fallen is such a graderer band than other, the song Evanescience is 2 good! The leader of the singer sounds kind of lick a gril... butt i still can taste then under there some where! and i luv that the band Kold join the singer in hes own expedition on the music lyfe!... Butt the gruup is note for everypersons it contanes material that is ghostly you c? I am a ghost in the see???? Magic songing like this make us ghosts cum to lyfe and feel dead. But this is only woth one purchase! If u pay again it might be the some music. But a far warning the music of for ghosts only not peps who beleive in fates. The sols r gone with that windy days. The song r deep n great so buy it but not twice on or you will forget to sleep on the music... IT SOO GOODYL!! BUY IT!!! PEACE!!"
1,Overrated & Depressing!,"The hype surrounding this album is truly astonishing, however I feel it doesn't live up to the hype at all. The lyrics are extremely repetitive and each song is more depressing than the next. I can't bear to listen to it at all now because it's such a downer! I feel this band is extremely overrated, especially the lead singer, who has a very weak voice that's piercing to the ears at times. I don't recommend this album to anyone, I guarantee you'll be disappointed, especially because it's being touted as a 'masterpiece.'"
2,RIPPED OFF LACUNA COIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"if you like this album you will most certainly go crazy over Lacuna Coil. Evanescence and this album is a straight RIP OFF of a REAL music group called Lacuna Coil. Lacuna Coil has been doing this longer and better with SO much more feeling in their songs as well. Evanescence sounds like this music was just put together like LEGOS compared to Lacuna Coil,..no feeling!! try ""Comalies"",..its their best album and far better than Evanescence. ""Unleashed Memories"" is a good cd as well. nothing against Evanescence but they flat STOLE their style from Lacuna Coil and DOES NOT pull it off as well as Lacuna Coil does. trust me, this is the only review i have ever written. i just felt i had to write it after hearing this cd after all the raving that has been done about it. if your a mindless 15 year old girl then you might like Evanescence better. but if you truly love music i PROMISE you like Lacuna Coil much better."
5,Amazing band,"I love this CD, it has a darkness and beauty that reminds of an Anne Rice novel. Its something that you would hear of either Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Angel. Fallen is wonderful"
4,Why Everyone Loves Evanescence.....,"Excluding Amy Lee's vocals, the reason all of us love Evanescence is because of Paul McCoy from 12 Stones. I actually don't think Evanescence is all they are cracked up to be... Let's face it, all John and Ben do is strike power chords. However, Ben has a few solos in the record, and they are a nice break from the power chords. I met them on Sept.12 when they were here in Atlanta for the Nintendo Fusion Tour. I actually met them by a meer coincidence where some dude about age 40 had an extra Meet and Greet pass. I was at the show for my dudes in Cold (Check them out). Cold should have headlined the tour..... Also check out 12 Stones. They rock! I hung with Paul McCoy and the guys on June 14, and Paul made me and my friends feel like royalty. Newayz, back to Evanescence..... The cd is kick-ass, but I just wish Ben and John would put more into their riffs and stuff. Later, y'all."
5,I listen to it everyday,"I got this CD when it was new in 2003. I've been addicted to Amy Lee's music ever since. I also have their follow-up album ""Anywhere but Home"" and eagerly await their next release, which should be in March 2006. If the music were clothes, I'd have worn them out by now :-D"
3,Very Good First Effort But Wears Thin,"Like many listeners, I was hooked by the tracks gaining heavy music TV rotation (""Bring Me To Life"" and ""Going Under"") and picked up the CD with great expectations. However, after several listenings, I find that the music wears thin after time - in my case, one week. Perhaps it is due the basic musical arrangements. I am a very basuc In my own humble opinion, Amy Lee's voice is light years ahead of the rest of the band in terms of range and emotion. In some ways, several of the songs sound like some of the B-Sides from Linkin Park. Beef up the guitars a bit with some additional fretboard prowess, either ditch the keyboards or improve the texture, and you will have a ""4 star"" album in my book. Then again, I am not a music critic, go get the CD and judge for yourself."
5,blown away...,"At first i was kinda skeptical about buying this cd...i saw them on Mtv:You hear it first and i thought they were ok. So i bought the CD with my b-day money. I was BLOWN away. This is by far one of the best Cd's i've ever boughten. The lyric's are very deep and Amy's vocals are awesome.All of the songs on this CD are great,all but 1 have good potential of being singles. The only song i dont like a lot is the 4th track,but all the other songs r bangin. If you want to hear something fresh,then buy this CD."
3,"Good, but...","""Fallen"" is a little different to the majority of nu-metal out there, with a slight gothic edge and the singer has a good voice...BUT!Australian band george has the lead singer Katie Noonan who has a similar, yet infinately superior voice. That, and george makes intelligent, interesting music with real emotion. I find ""Fallen"" has just one too many nu-metal cliches for me.Bottom line: go and get george's album ""polyserena"". You won't regret it!"
3,Evanescence is not an original band,"To everyone hailing Evanescence as an original band, or calling their sound original, take a look at the band Lacuna Coil. The whole ""goth metal"" sound w/ a female lead is nothing new. Now before everyone starts wigging out on me, I'm not dogging on Evanescence, Fallen is a decent cd. It just burns me up to see people calling them original. They are carbon copy. Listen to Lacuna Coil's ""Comalies"" cd, or any of their other releases. They are phenomenal."
5,Evancesnce,"I was a fan of Evanescence before Fallen, ... I own the Independent release (Origin).So As soon as they dropped there Debue I had to take a look into that (Ok I bought it the day it came out.) And I simiply fell in love with Evanescence again. I mean Origin was a great Cd even better then the Hybrid Theory EP.If you own origin then you know how good they are. And if you don't then you are about to get a taste. From Opening tack to the last track Fallen is a great Cd. My favorite Tracks on here are Going Under, Bring Me To Life, My Immortal ,Tourniquet & Haunted. ..the rest of the songs are just as good. Amy Lee has a great voice and will be going places with Evanescence. So if you don't own origin, ...get this album trust me this album has brought music back to life.(Pun intended)"
1,boring and commercial,"ahem.... dont you just love it when a band such as Evanescence are falsely rewarded as being innovators of a musical genre when all they did was water down and commercialize it? it makes me sick how people say Evanescence is great and original. Their male singer's vocals are so so bad, probably after loads upon loads of studio doctoring. Amy Lee is overrated as well. She holds the same key throughout 'Bring Me To Life'. its laughable, but ah well, the whiney spoiled 14 year old kids need music too, its just too sad that they choose garbage such as this."
1,Get ready for the crash,"It took Evanescence a half a decade to come up with the songs on this CD (for those of us who remember the garbage they cut to CD when they released Origin in 2000 and the two EPs prior to that.) They managed to cull out just short of a dozen songs for Fallen, and they result is still pathetic. The next CD, which they will surely be under pressure to write, will suck far more than this one. To make matters worse, they won the Grammy for Best New Artist - sure to send them to the cut out bin on future CDs, just like every other artist to win that award.Fallen has to be the most repetitive CD I've ever heard. The first two songs are a sign of the remaining nine. Same goes for the lyrics. Over and over with the same trite, high-schoolish, I'm-in-so-much-pain whining. Amy--cut your wrists already and save all the misery."
1,"Please, Make It Stop!","I can't state it any clearer than Forest Law's review. Evanescence is awful. They're a corporate band on a corporate label run by corporate greed. Funny how the stories of Amy Lee being Christian were swept under the rug as soon as that first awful song hit the top of the chart, huh? She's a fake, but a well-coached one. The entire Wind-Up label is a joke. It should be called Flash-in-the-Pan Music. My advice to Evanescence: INVEST WISELY. My advice to those of you who are thinking of buying this: go to the used CD store. There are thousands of them there. Right next to Nickelback and 3 Doors Down and Creed and Good Charlotte and the rest of the rock radio crap that's currently riding this wave of teen idolization. Wake me up in 2006."
1,This album has 'Fallen' into the trash can.,"I've heard this band beiong compared to Linkin Park many times, and I thought to myself ""Hey, Linkin Park isn't that bad of a band. I think I'll listen to this Evanescence album"". Sadly, I found out that this really didn't sound like a Linkin Park album one bit.The main problem that I had with this album is that every song sounded the same to me. And the thing is, that song sounded like crap to me. So this whole album felt like an hour-long crappy song to me.I give it 1 star*"
2,"Good voice, but dissapointed",Music for the most part sounds like Linkin Park and many songs sound the same. Scoring: 1 Star for A great Female voice and 1 star for the frequent piano- power chord guitar mix = 2 stars.Order the single.
2,Not bad for a debut...,"... but I've heard better! The songs, while rocking and quite good, do just sound like variations on one theme. I love ""Bring Me To Life"" as a track, but having heard all the versions of it possible (with the ""rap"", without the ""rap"", accoustic, live, etc) I have to say that the song is only as good as it is because of Paul McCoy of 12 Stones. That's a REALLY good album.Seriously, give 12 Stones a listen and I guarantee you'll agree with me on which Wind-Up band has more talent. I'm not saying Evanescence are bad, the album's quite good for a first go, but as someone who has been reviewing CDs for some time and is themselves a musician, I can say this is not as good as it's hyped up to be. It IS the best album of the year... but that isn't really saying a lot!"
2,Overated hype....,"First off I'd like to inform all the radio-friendly listeners that this is not original...if you knew anything about metal then you would know that great bands like Lacuna Coil and Nightwish were doing this way before Evanscene...but for the mainstream they are head and shoulders above the rest.The music is okay, nothing special though. The female vocals take centre stage with some great vocal talent. But then there is the nu-metal vocalist...omg how much does he sound like other bands like Finch and Hell is for Heros, an obvious strategy to sell more records. And the music is fairly average.Conclusion:The female vocalist deserves five stars the male vocalists deserve one and the band deserves 2.5 stars. Contains lots of catchy hooks for the radio friendly audience to sell by the millions.If you are a true fan of metal and music as a whole do your self a favour and pick up a Nightwish, Lacuna Coil, Opeth, or Pain Of Salvation album, and get some value for money."
3,Okay,"This is a mediocre album at best, even for fans of metal/industrial stuff. Amy Lee is NOT a great singer, contrary to popular belief...- Aimee Echo, of Human Waste Project and theSTART has a much better, haunting voice. The production is very contrived, with very simple guitar parts, string backgrounds, and beats. The whole album is the basically the same song rehashed a bunch of times, except for My Immortal, which is a mediocre piano ballad that doesn't fit with the rest of the album.Don't get me started on the unoriginal lyrics - ...The best part of the album is the beginning of ""Haunted"" (where, coincidentally, Amy Lee's vocals are distorted) - but you can just download that.I guess you might like it if you're a fan of Linkin Park's newer stuff (safe, cliched lyrics, fake-metal, all the songs sound the same, etc.)..."
4,Goth Rock Done Right,"Evanescence's album Fallen is packed full of great music. There is more to this CD than `Bring Me to Life.' There are some powerfully dark songs like `Haunted' and `Hello.' The vocals, the beats and the evocative piano riffs are original and fresh. When I am in a brooding mood this is the CD I turn to. It's one of my favorites even though it just came out."
2,decent but its a bite,"This cd is good, im not going to deny that, its not great, but it is a decent piece of work compared to most of the other bands releasing lately. However, if you have ever heard of a band called Lacuna Coil you would notice a very close similarity. The only problem with evanescence is that they lack the spark that Lacuna coil has, as well as the fact that Amy Lee's voice isnt as good and the vocal harmonies of Lacuna are far better. Lacuna's riffs and songs are darker and more emotional and Cristina's voice covers more range. I would recommend Lacuna Coil anyday before this band (pick up comalies), the original is always better then the clones!"
4,Excellent potential,"Amy Lee's voice is phenomenal. Some of the lyrics on this CD are a touch melodramatic, but overall they're intelligent. The thing that galls me is that sometimes one of the guitar players drowns out Lee's voice, as if the song is all about him and his guitar parts. It's not! The band needs to learn to showcase Lee's voice and not compete with her.I can't wait for their next album!"
3,Okay for the price,"The product and packaging were good enough that I'll keep them, but they weren't great. The product itself, described as new and shrink wrapped, didn't look new to me. There were minor scratches on the jewel case, and minor scratches and streaks on the disc. The shrink wrap didn't look original, and there was dust under it. There were no functional problems with any of it though. The packaging was difficult to open and the packing slip was not neatly cut. Large portions of the text on it were even cut off. So for the discounted price of $5.74, this was an okay deal, but I felt the product condition was not accurately described, and it wouldn't have been that hard to package it better."
5,Fallen for Evanescence,"I've never posted a review, all i do is read from others, but i saw myself posting one after i listened to Evanescence, the album made me say to myself ""life is worth living"". Its listed amongst my fav albums, i dont skip a track to another. I doubt if they'd be able to come up with a better album. It captures all kind of Rock listeners, Soft, Hard, Alternative & even down to anti-rockers, you just have to fall in love with a particular track in there."
3,I bought this cd for the song Bring Me to Life...,"And i probably should have stuck wth the single. There are some other good ones on here (Going Under, Tourniquet, My Last Breath) but I wouldn't say that is enough to make me want to buy it. It does have a cool sound though, especially with the choir backing them up, but that's not enough. The worst song is My Immortal, a song for the Goth. I would recommend buying this cd cheap used, not new, your $s not worth it."
5,One of the best CDs ever,"I got this CD as a gift and just wanted to listen to one song, but I let the CD play all the way through and ended up liking the whole CD. Every song on this album is great. I no longer just listen to one song, I listen to all of the songs.I just can't wait till they come out with another album, and hopefully it will be just as good if not better as fallen."
2,They seem Lacuna Coil,I heard 'Bring me to life' in daredevil soundtrack and I thought it was Lacuna Coil....so I was surprised when I discovered about evanescence.Lacuna Coil do this music genre from 1996..try to listen to their albums.
5,Loved it!,"I had first heard the song Bring Me To Life because it was WWE's theme song for their latest Pay-Per-View, No Way Out. I liked the song so much, I bought the CD on a whim. I am so happy that I did. As soon as the first song played, I knew that this CD was about to become one of my favorites. I play it so much, my friends are sick of it. Amy Lee has a great voice, which sounds amazing with the music stlye the band uses. I can't wait until Evanescence puts out another CD."
3,Pretty Good Album!!!,"Evanescence is a pretty Great band (especially the vocals)! I myself thought they did agreat job on songs like: Fallen, My Immortal, and Haunted, but some of the other songs are weaker for my taste. If you buy the Daredevil sound track you get Fallen, feat. The 12 Stones, which puts a little more rock into the song. You can also find My Immortal on the same cd. I'm not saying not to buy this cd, it all depends on your taste of music. Also if you buy The Punisher sound track you get the song Broken by Seether and Amy Lee the vocals of Evanescence."
2,Disappointed,"I got to know Evanescence by some MP3's on MP3.com and I was like ""WOW"". So, haling from The Netherlands, I ordered their first album Origin. The mixture from Gothic rock, and some metal influences had something special.So when word came oud that there was going to be an new album, I was really curious.It turned out to be very disappointing. All the refreshing and experimental influences were gone and the musical direction had turned to a direction I don't like that much.To put it in another way: They sound like Linkin park with a female vocalist. Well, there are enough clones of linkin park already.Is fallen that bad? No. It's high quality music, but it's nothing special. Please return to the old sound."
5,Definantly one of if not THE BEST CD IVE EVER OWNED,I believe that Evanescence is one of the best metal/rock bands that have ever existed. there sound is awesome. the lirics are incredible with a christian message intertwined as well as goth message. I would incourage any rock lover to buy this cd...i listen to it all the time and i love it... EVANESCENCE ROCKS OUTLOUD!!!
3,There is potential....,"Evanescence has potential. 'My Immortal', 'Bring Me To Life', and some other songs with piano accompaniments worked nicely, I think. 'My Immortal' is the only saving grace in this album. The piano was played soulfully, and the singing was hauntingly beautiful.Sadly, the guitars and drums were rather dull. The sound quality is too mainstream to be unique and fresh. Evanescence should decide what they REALLY want to be: goth, or mainstream pop. This in-between style they're doing is not working. I say they should write more songs like 'My Immortal', I was so disappointed that they didn't [in this album]."
5,I was verrrrry surprised!,"WOW! This is an awesome recording! An awesome debut!I was blown away by ""Bring Me To Life"". But then I read that the guy that rapped/sang on that song was Paul McCoy from 12 Stones. So I thought... ""Ah! So the rest of the C.D. is gonna sound nothing like that!"" But it's even BETTER!But this is an awesome C.D. The drums are freaking wild and tight. There actually... Can it be? Guitar solos? Yes! A lost art!The choirs are beautifully scary. Amy's vocals and lyrics are beautiful. Great C.D. It will not dissappoint. BUY IT!"
5,Probably one of the best rock albums of 2003.,"Evanescence is getting alot of crap it seems like, and I think it is really stupid. They are a great band from my home state, and they deserve the..what?...like around three or four grammy nominations? They won two grammies! They can't be that bad after all. David Hodges (the co-writer of all the songs) went to my school. Great people, great band, great cd."
2,really overrated,"bad teenage angst lyrics mixed with generic music do not make a good album. the overplayed ""Bring Me To Life"" i've never found to be even worth a listen, and the other tracks are no better. technically this could be considered linkin park-y metal which fits into ""bad nu-metal"", so if you want good nu-metal that is still lighter than heavy metal, look at bands such as Snot, Slipknot, or even Korn, who do this sort of thing with much more style. on the other hand, if you want real ""emotional"" music, look at bands such as Mogwai, Explosions in the Sky, or Mum."
4,Rock hard Music Fan,"Evanescence at first took on the Christian band scene and I do not know why they chose so but I am certainly glad they did. Not only does this cd reach into your soul and amaze you with the ability they have of relating themselves to you. Yes, some of these songs you can only relate to if you have been depressed before but im sure everyone has been depressed at one time or another. All in all this cd is touching with songs like ""My Immortal"" but also has a rock kind of feel to it with songs like ""Bring Me To Life"" and ""Going Under"" and with songs with a mixture of both such as ""Everybody's Fool"". I strongly suggest everyone listen to this cd and give them a chance before judging them by the way they look on the cd."
1,Gabage,This is the most annoying band in the world. They have the most annoying songs call fallen and my immortal(weak and annoying )How can all you people give this piece of crap more than one star????? The singer is god dam horrible!!!! She can't sing! Try Arch Enemy if you wanna great vocal by girl(who is prettier then this dumb face ). This is just another MTV and radio friendly dumb boy/girl band.
1,Been here seen there,"There have been numerous Evanescence type of bands in the last decade so what's the fuss here? Even the only good thing, My Immortal sounds uninspiring and too trite. And just talk about the same bland songs in a pool!"
2,Trying Too Hard,"I will be the first to admit that Amy Lee has a unique and beautiful voice but in their album ""Fallen"" it seems to me that they were trying too hard to be ""creepy"" and ""gothic"" in order to attract a certain fanbase. I don't know...it seems kinda fake to me. A hit and a miss. Weird lyrics that don't make any sense compiled together to seem falsely dark and demented. Nice try but awful. Stop trying so hard. (I give a two simply for the quality of Amy's voice) This album is nothing special simply just another band struggling to appeal to today's angsty and brooding youth."
1,Most overrated album of 2003!!,"I bought this album for the singles ""Bring Me To Life"", ""Going Under"", and ""My Immortal"". I was so disappointed!! The rest of the album sounds absolutely NOTHING like these songs! After song seven, I began to wonder if track five was set on repeat!! ""Hello"" sounds remotely close to ""My Immortal"", but doesn't quite add up. Do yourself a big favor and just buy/download the singles! I'm selling this to some other unsuspecting person A.S.A.P.!! Go ahead and press the ""not helpful"" button, I don't care!"
1,a blatant rip off of Nightwish,"If you all want to hear how it is really done listen to anything by a Finnish band called Nightwish. Evanescence is just a cheap American pop clone. Now that you all know my true feelings I will also say that people should really stop reviewing things multiple times to raise or lower a rating, that is just plain childish."
1,"Oh, I'm Christian but also goth! Look at me! Look at me!","Okay, I have very few things to say about this album.1) It sucks. I'm not just some pissy nu-metal hater (well, I am...), I've heard the entire album several times. It's talentless, vague and radio-friendly garbage.2) Evanescence only wishes they could be what Lacuna Coil is. If you really like Evanescence, check out Lacuna Coil--you'll be pleased.3) And now the only rewarding quality of this album--Amy Lee is pretty hot. But you don't need to buy the album for that... there are pictures online for free. Yay. She may be a talentless horrible person, but she's got nice cleavage!"
1,Rip-Off,"They're a complete and utter rip-off of Nightwish. And, like another poster mentioned, they ripped off various nu-metal bands...but who cares about nu-metal? Anyways, check out Nightwish in the link above; and/or, check out Lacuna Coil above. They're both great bands. :)"
1,Stupid Crap,"You heard me all you wannabe goths, this is stupid crap. The singer sounds like some chick that is on her . plus the guitarist and drummer can't play if their life depended on it. It is simply illogical as to wht you people listen to this garbage, it sucks! Some Nu-Metal bands are good, but this is not one of them.Send me hate mail, my e-mail is Auragorn@aol.com hahaha."
1,pop music for posers,"this album is pure pop with songs that make the beach boys seem heavythey are certanly not goth. they admited themselvs that they are not gothand how could anyone possibly label them metal? what kind of metal would you think they are hmmm lets see... NONE people who listen to evanescence dont even know what kinds of metal are out ther, like death metal, hardcore, black metal, grindcore, speed metal, classic black metal, thrash metal, norweigen black metal, classic thrash metal, satanic black metal, and more...but if you like pop music then i would recoment this album to all you pop fansbut if you start buying your clothes at hot topic to be like all the other posers than go listen to some real music like napalm death, gorgoroth, god dethroned, cannibal corpse, hatebreed, burzum, immortal, ulver, mayhem, slayer, arch enemy, cradle of filth, dimmu borgir, sepultura, devildriver, mastodon, and Zyklonso please to all you posers, eather stop or get into some real music"
1,horrible!!!,"i hate this stupid band. and i hate it when they are compared to lacuna coil. dont ever compare them to this loser, poser band. they are not even goth, they are just wannabe goth so those stupid poser kids can buy this crap. plus the woman cant even sing. she sounds ok on the cd, but live she sounds like she has a damn sore throat. this is a pathetic band that plays crappy music, and whoever calls this band goth is just some stupid poser. if u want goth try some cradle of filth, dimmu borgir, marilyn manson, and marduk. i give this album pure nothing."
2,ok.,"Well, a mainstream rock band with a female singer. Somewhat original and stuff, but I wouldn't be surprised if there were already 20 clones running around by the end of next year. Its decent music, the only reason most people associate them with rap/rock is because of their first single (my friend made me listen to it, I have given up on radio except for my good ol' Pix 106). Overall, my opinion on this band is that their singer is hot, but I will never buy this C.D. Thank you and good night."
2,Fresh air?,"Unique?The Gathering and Lacuna Coil have been making the same ""type"" of music (Heavy music + enchanting female voclas) for almost a decade.And they're much better at it. (including Aneke's voice)The only thing this band did was to go mainstream and be MTV-Marketable."
1,Check it out!,2 be honest i wouldn't think of buying this album coz im more into r 'n' b music but i got it 4 my birthday so thats how i came across it. I was actually suprised coz this album is pretty good!The lyrics are well thought out and the melodies are very catchy so its not just noise. Also its not all hard core rock it has beautiful ballads like My Immortal. So don't knock it till you try it
1,soooo bad,"""Bring Me To Life"" is the worst song I've ever heard that gets so much attention. It's a crying shame horrible groups like Evanescence get so much attention. They're sooo bad. The girl doesn't belong anywhere near the microphone. As a guy whose name is Evan, I'm really embarrassed of their name. It's a travesty against Evans across the world."
5,Great New Band,"I bought this CD with the assumption that is would be as good as their hit on the DareDevil soundtrack. Well, let me tell you, it's even better. I love the mix of sounds in all their songs, ranging from Violins, Piano, Harmonic vocals, and even a touch of chant vocals. In my opinion I think their music is a mix of Rifs ranging from Linkin Park to Tori Amos, their songwriting reminds me of Poe. Overall I was Extremely excited to hear something new, fresh, and energetic."
3,Don't fix it if it ain't broken,"This could be called the worst of Evanesence. If you have ever heard the original version of Whisper you will have to agree. I bought the CD anyway to support them. I only hope their next release will be without the ""popular sound"" addition. I know they cannot be completely happy with this one."
1,Absoulute Crap,"This is absoulutely the worst album and quite possibly the worst band ever. This Amy Lee chick sounds like she's dying when she sings. It's sad that so many people can actually call this rock I mean, this is a cd I would buy just to crack it. I can't believe so many people like this crap, I'll tell you what real rock is, try Linkin Park, Metallica, Korn, stuff like that. About the only thing I can say good about this band is that Amy Lee is hot. Honestly the most annoying part about this band is that people can actually call this rock. I don't mean to sound sexist but, girls and hard rock, they just don't mix. Sorry ladies. If it was possible I would give this album less then 1 star but this rating thing don't go into negatives. If you feel depressed and want to hurt yourself in some way but this album and listen to it, otherwise don't even bother."
1,I Just Don't Get It.,"I really don't see how there is anybody out there who actually thinks that any of this groups songs are good. I'll give them credit for halfway decent music, but that's not the reason I gave it such a low review. The reason for that is because the lead singer has one of the worst voices that I have ever heard. It's like listening to fingernails on a chalkboard. This girl's voice is something that the world should have to hear again, or have even heard in the first place. It just goes to show you how talentless a band can be these days. I really hope that it doesn't get any worse than this."
1,PLEASE!!!!!!!,"More minimalist nu-metal guitars, cheezy synthesizers, angst-ridden vocals, etc. etc.And not unexpectedly, this CD has the same rhythm throughout -- the same rhythm that's been used throughout all ""rock"" music of the past 5 years:Boom ^ ^ ^ Clack ^ B' B' Boom Clack ^ ^ Clack ^ ^ B' (repeat).It's torture already."
1,Most Brutal Heavy Metal Since Linkin Park!,"The heavy metal diehards at MTV have outdone themselves! They must have thought ""Can we get any heavier, any more brutal than Linkin Park? Can it be done? Is it possible? YES! Of course! Let's inject it with estrogen!""And so we now have what is probably the most terrifying, offending, gut-wrenching piece of goat-praising brutality EVER released! The vocals are so tortured, so heartfelt, so moving, the synthesizers so lush, so spooky and haunting, and the guitar work so bone-crushingly heavy, that you'll be clenching your teddy bear 'till the very end. Do not pass up this masterpiece of metal!"
1,this is crap,"god if you think this is good or goth you must be crazy this isnt good enough to fit in an catagory but crap ..if you think your goth and you listen to evanecsence your a major poser...goth is banshees bauhaus sisters of mercy switchblade symphony , etc not amy lee talking about her little relationship problems and SHE'S UGLY"
2,Not a rock fan but........,I must say the lead sing is very talented. The songs Call me when your sober and My Immortal were my favorite. I judged her by her looks (kinda gothic). But I'll give her props her songs will touch you.
2,Evanescence - Fallen CD,I found the album to be too much of the same thing. Each track sounds too similiar and I was very disappointed since I think the lead singer is very talented. I was sorry I purchased the CD without testing it out first at a Borders store.
2,0.o Right-o...,"Ugh! I'll hand it to this sinking diva, she knows how to flaunt it, but that doesn't mean she can SING. The thing that gets me: every song on this disc sound the same--loud, annyoing, and pointless. I'll agree with my previous reviewer...If this were written by someone else, this CD would be zip. You got it, girl, you are GOING UNDER!"
5,No surprise at all,"I'm in the collegiate media, and I found out about this band weeks before they even release ""BMTL"" as a single. This group has so much great music outside of Fallen, and there are numerous web-sites where you can go to find some of their original works, which I think is even better (if there is such a thing) than this CD.Easily this is one of the 5 best CDs I've purchased in the last year...so much so, that I wore out my first copy from playing it so much. Now I also have to re-burn all the compilations of their older material I came into contact with because it's about 2 steps from being worn out."
3,Ever heard of The Third and the Mortal?,"The first time I heard the first single, Bring Me to Life, I was immediately reminded of a (imho) GREAT band from Norway called The Third and the Mortal. But Evanescence doesn't come close, especially once they break down into the rap drivel that the kids today can't live without. That's not to say it's not without some bright spots, particularly the (quieter) piano pieces, that really let her voice shine.Overall, it's probably worth it. As for me, I'll gladly pay for the Norwegian band who may have inspired Evanescence. They are definitely worth it. If you have never heard them (I haven't met anyone else who has), then you should. They define the ""style"", whatever you may want to call it."
5,My Immortal,"Two of the album's songs made it into the ""Daredevil"" soundtrack. A fairly uncommon result for a new band. While ""Bring me to Life"" got the play time, ""My Immortal"" is far more haunting and more enchanting. It's amazing that this was written prior to the movie, because it fits in so well with the scene following Electra dad's life. The whole CD is great !!"
5,GREAT CD!,"I really do not like rock of any kind, but I love this CD. I like every song which is a real shocker to me! It will take me a long time to get tired of this amazing CD!"
1,Goth? Linkin Park? Yeah right.,"I find it sickening how people compare Evanescence to Linkin Park and call them ""goth"" so much. Honestly. Just LISTEN to them!! They mine as well have 'POP' tattooed across their foreheads. The musicians aren't that bad, but their singer is horrible. Her voice is grating and annoying, and she is so obviously self-centered (look at their cd cover...). And what kind of name is ""Evanescence"" for a ""goth"" band, anyway? Posers."
1,"Oh my god, why did I buy this?","This CD is the most unimaginative thing I've heard in a long time. I couldn't wait to turn it off. Hopefully, I can sell it used and get some money back."
2,disappointed,"I was extremely disappointed when I bought this cd a few days ago. The content was not very good. I was expecting a good, clean, entertaining cd and instead I found one that was quite disturbing. The lyrics main themes were breathing and bleeding. I had heard so many great things about this album, like how they were Christian (which they definitely are not), and their words were so great. The only positive thing I can find about this cd is that their music, especially guitar and piano, was very well done and they are talented musicians."
5,Dark Rock at its best!,"I got chills when I first listened to this haunting CD! Tracks 2, 4, and 9 especially! This is the next big thing in music. Enya meets Linkin park in a mind-blowing dark experience in sound. I cannot get enough of this CD! I hope they keep making music - I greedily anticipate their next album!"
2,There's only one reason...,"There's only one reason to listen to this band: Amy Lee has an incredibly smooth and powerful voice. Though it has no-doubt been run through more filters than your drinking water and spent dozens of hours in Pro Tools, it works. She is fun to listen to.The rest of the band is your average nu-metal radio band. They have next to no chops, and they don't really bother to give us anything interesting musically (that main guitar riff in ""Tourniquet"" is kinda cool, though). But, they back up Amy decently, and that's enough for a few listens.In short, if you want to hear a good female singer in a rock band, then pick up this album. If you demand anything interesting from the other members, then leave it on the shelf."
4,This is one major rip off,"okey i bought ths a long time ago because i loved the album cover and i thought it would be a really cool Gothic Metal album. since i don't watch MTV ever i didn't know this was going to be a cover up for a really bad pop album. anywase the album ended up sucking bad and i wondered why i bought it. so here is my advise to anyone thinking about getting this: if you want REAL Gothic Metal check out bands like Sirenia, Tristania, Gathering, Theatre of Tragedy, or Sins of Thy Beloved. thank you for reading my review.1/10"
4,Dark rock,"I like this album but it's not cheerful stuff. Kind of makes me want to put on alot of black eyeliner. The songs are not overtly depressing, though!! If you have heard any of their songs on the radio or seen videos on MTV/VH1, then you should know what to expect on this CD, and you won't be disappointed."
5,nirvana fan,"opens with the brilliant going under and bring me to life. a mix of goth an rock an some powerful ballards, no fillers on this cd, excellent from start to finish."
3,"Mainstream, so?","Despite the complaints that Evanescence has brought the much-loved underground goth scene to radio and MTV (which i agree with to an extent), this is not bad music. I think this kind of music is also a little too sugary for most goth fans, but for those who enjoy jumping on the popular bandwagons of the 21st century, this would definately not be a bad buy.However, for those mainstreamers who enjoy this cd, and want a more realistic taste of true goth-metal, i suggest you check out the vast quantity that amazon has to offer (try Tristania)"
2,Mediocrity and disapointment never rocked so hard,"When I first heard of this band it was reading the lyrics to their overplayed hit off the album. Spiritual in nature and moving in content, but the writing is quite banal. It is the highlight of the album however. MY Immortal grasps at half spiritual mantra and half love song and succedes in acheiving neither. This is just lyricly.As far as musical composition is concerned I was even further disapointed. The technical writing shows a very limited creativity. The same notes and progresion will be used with only slight rythmic variation through out entire songs. The addition of hardcore-esq vocals in some songs ruin them.Not a bad first album, but I hope their musical quality grows and the lyrics escape the self-loathing angsty trite rut they seem to be in."
2,I'm not sure why everyone is so excited over it,"I've been listening to this cd for about a week or so and the best thing I can say about it is amy has a great voice. The music is rather boring. There's no memorable riffs or anything and the lyrics are incredibly cliche. Most of the songs sound quite similar to each other to me as well. It's not something that I'll be listening to for the next couple of months that's for sure. I guess it does have a ""haunting"" sound to it, or whatever, but that type of music is just boring to me."
3,Its ok but...,"Everyone keeps calling this a Christian record. I see nothing Christian about it. The songs are alright... I guess. This album is just a bunch of self pitty, ""I need money, I've had such a hard life, listen to my lyrics"" album. Its just a depressing album. Its not a Christian album... All I have to say."
5,it rules,"This album is so cool! The music is awesome and there are a ton of little, interesting details that sound really cool. I really love the guitar. If people have a problem with the vocals being female, get over it because girls can do anything boys can and do it better."
5,best rock album in 5 years,"At the risk of repeating one of the 1700 or so other reviews of this work, it is a masterpiece, although comparisons with Limp Bizkit are just plain wrong. Actually, it is more like Creed with talent. Amy Lee's voice is astonishing, and her lyrics are even more so, although to say they are melodramatic is a BIG understatement. The guitar work is sometimes awful (too heavy-handed) and the chorus and strings are just plain self- indulgent - I bet they'll never have to sing ""saving me, raping me"" from ""Haunted"" again!. At any rate, these are just nitpicks. This is a fantastic CD, and I can't wait for the follow-up(s).Best songs - ""Going Under"", ""Bring Me To Life"",""My Immortal"", ""My Last Breath"", ""Whisper""Worst Song - ""Tourniquet"""
4,Really Good,"Make no mistake about it, although it's mainstream pop music, this album is very good. This isn't goth rock, lets get that straight right now, but it is dark rock music that has found it's way into the popular music charts of Mtv, VH1, and local Hit Music stations across the country (something not easily done). Bottom line, this is a great album, well worth the money, and definatly worth a listen"
4,A pinch of Goth and a dash of punk.,"After seing the horrible flop, at least for fanboys and seekers of a true plot, that was Daredevil, I specifically noted the song Bring Me To Life in it's pulse-pounding soundtrack. I had delayed a few weeks, afraid of the other songs on this seemingly mediocre album, but I was very surprised.All of the songs are good in their own way, and the haunting piano melodies seem to amplify Amy's voice. The most notable songs, which there are many of, are Tourniquet, Going Under, Imaginary and the seriously noteworthy My Immortal, which is very calm for it's quite dark lyrics. Though it may not seem fitting, the composition in it is quite amazing.While this album is great, we all know how far a little thing called audio editing can go. Evanescence absolutely sucks in concert. I am not kidding. If you have this album, don't think about going to a concert.Peace Out,NW"
3,Goth Metal surfaces!!!,"Finally after 8 years of waiting for this music genre to surface.Unfortuntely, for those of you have reviewed this album favorably, you have all somehow missed the incredible bands responsible for the creation of this sound.If you like this you should definitely check out bands like ""The Gathering"" & ""Lacuna Coil"". Evanescence is very good but definitely is riding in on the coat-tails of the much more talented ""Lacuna Coil"". Five Star rating.Now for the last reviewer, who claims that Evanescence copies ""Linkin Logs""...oops...I mean ""Linkin Park"". ""Linkin Park"" is not qualified to even be mentioned in the same paragraph as these other bands. If you want to talk about bands ripping off other bands, how about the fact that ""Linkin Park"" is almost and exact replica of ""Korn"".Anyway, I've ranted long enough.Buy the Evaanescence"" CD. It's good."
1,this sux,"she's annoyin=g and why she dresses like a ""Goth"" if they don't gven reach the G cause they aren't that hard!"
1,About....what?,"I am told that to appreciate this pitiful mockery of music, one must read between the lines and interpret the lyrics of a group that sings of one thing and means another. For those with the ability to do so and the time to waste on it, this is the album for you!For those without the ability and who like their messages delivered straight up without the crap, look elsewhere. The sole light at the end of this seemingly endless tunnel of darkness and despair is the voice of Amy Lee, who's voice is clear, sweet, and tragically wasted on this disturbing mess of sounds and empty lyrics masquerading as a ""music"" album."
1,Fallen... Down Into The Mire.,"How to describe this C.D... First, we start with derivative ""Linkin Park""-style background music. Then, we add a semi-talented female lead singer, who Tarja from Nightwish could blow out of the water easily. (Amy Lee isn't bad: she just needs to learn more vocal range, because her voice varies little from song to song.) We also add a good smidgen of faux-angsty vocals which get real annoying, REAL fast. All those ingredients combine into a product that is, ultimately, quite mediocre, and really not worth your money or time."
1,Please,"More quasi-goth rock for 15 year olds trying to say ""look at me, I'm saaad!"" This cd has no substance that I can find.'wake me up inside'?'save me from the nothing I've become'?come on.If you were duped into buying this cd and think you can handle something alot harder and infinitely more depressing, check out Shape of Despair's ""Shades of..."" or ""Angels of Destress"". Show it to your semi-goth friend, and watch the tears start to flow."
5,Excellent new band,"I don't know where the Tori Amos type references come from. Evanescence reminds me more of Stabbing Westward with a female lead singer. Powerful and emotional, I hope to hear a lot more from these fine folks."
2,Too overrated!,There are like only 3 songs on the album that has a decent toon to them plus my fav song is Going Under!To tell you the truth the album is overrated because it realy isent that great but as long as you like it enjoy!
1,Evanescence Simply Sucks.,"Evanescence is totally overrated. I can't believe people are calling it metal. It is an insult to real metal. Evanescence is alternative pop rock. Amy Lee is not an exceptional singer. She is above average, but she doesn't have what it takes to be really great. Her voice is very distorted and it sounds like she has never heard of breath control. I would much rather listen to talented singers, like Tarja from Nightwish, or Vibeke from Tristania.Also, their songs are boring. They go verse, chorus, verse, chorus, blah blah blah. The lyrics are sub-par. It doesn't take much imagination to come up with something so simple. Nevermind the riffs are something that should only appeal to a 14 year old Hot Topic poster child.Evanescence is just a trend that will hopefully pass quickly. If you are looking for metal, this isn't it. If you want to swallow whatever the mainstream music industry tells you to, then this CD is for you. Frankly, I hated it."
2,Easily Forgotten...,"The first couple of songs were worth a listen; however, by the fifth track, I noticed something...the songs are in EXACTLY the same key and the same subject matter is repeated incessantly - love and death. By the end of the album, I was bored. No doubt the album ""rocks"" at times, but there is nothing new or original here, just repetitious themes (both lyricially and musically). I doubt if one year from now, I even bother to listen to the one or two tracks that were okay. Buy the CD single ""Bring Me to Live"" and spare yourself the expense of purchasing the entire album, that way you won't have to listen to the various incarnations of the same song."
2,why can't I upload this music to my MP3 player??!!!,"I love the Evanescence music, so, naturally I ran right out and bought the CD at Best Buy. I found, however, that my MP3 converter is useless with the band's copywrites. I do not own CD player. I listen to my CDs on my MP3 player exclusively. Now what am I going to do??!!!"
1,Hideous,"This CD has one of the most annoying album covers I have ever seen. And in this case, it's very wise to judge by the cover. What's inside is even more irritating.Never mind that its members backpedaled on their Christian faith. The most offensive aspect of Evanescence is Evanescence itself-a calculated mix of sweet-sounding female vocals, nü-metal crunch, and a gruff shouty-guy who made the band sound like an evil version of The B-52's. At last report, the shouty-guy had unexpectedly exited Evanescence's European tour, perhaps never to return. Stay far, far away, shouty-guy. (The Onion AV)"
4,Good thing they're from America,"There are two European bands leagues ahead of them and yet the ONLY reason this band is becoming huge is because they're from America. Like this then you NEED to give Lullacry and Nightwish a listen. They will absolutely floor Evanescence. Don't get me wrong this album is good and it's a great commercialization piece to bring Goth more to the masses. And yes, this is the new Goth, and it's getting so much better. See the last three albums by Therion for a more melancholy approach to the new sound that will hopefully sweep over this country."
2,naaaaaaaaaah!!!!!!,"this cd is uimpressive, i listened the single they have on radio and was captivated with the female vocalist but the poppy music and raped male singind messed the whole song, so i decided to listen to the cd (burned of course) expecting something more and it was the same riffs and same structures and gets boring and repetitive. compared to goth bands (lacuna coil, moonspell, tiamat, the gathering) they fail, and compared with really great bands with female vocalist (new arch enemy, lacuna coil, nightwish, sinergy) they fall even further, so like others say, the lead singer should break with those linkin park wannabees and start again with better musicians or more mature writers."
4,Where did they come from?,This Album is awesome! A Linkin Park feel to the music bundled with a voice comperable to Tori Amos. A great combination and A great album to just crank up and jam in your headphones. I expect good things to come for this group with a unique sound like this.
4,great cd,this is just like linkin park cept add a girl singer. my favorite song is the one from daredevil bring me to life!
5,Fallen,"This cd is the best. Wheither or not the lyrics are similiar to anothers, it is still pretty darn good. If you think about most music is a newer version of country."
2,catchy music with lame lyrics,"Basically, if you've heard one song on this album, you've heard them all. They all sound the same, and they all have lame, cliche lyrics that are all about the same thing. Evanescence are trying very hard to be goth, but it's not working. They are pretty much a pop band using depression as a gimmick to pull in all the other wanna-be goths."
1,PATHETIC!!!,"This music is just aweful. If you want to listen to good music listen to the Frames or Vic Trill, or maybe even Celtic Frost."
2,Only two good songs,"I bought this CD after hearing two of their songs on the radio. I was disappointed. Amy Lee's vocals are amazing, but the guitars and drums drown her out. Overall, this is a very mediocre CD. The only two songs that I like are ""My Immortal"" due to the theme of lost love and melancholy and ""Hello"" because I love the piano that's interlaced throughout the song. I don't know what lead singer Amy Lee sees in the rest of her band, but she'd be better off solo. I gave this CD two stars for the two songs I like."
2,Fallen,"This is nothing more than generic corporate arena rock, slightly (but only slightly) updated from the 70s and 80s. Lots of bombast, slick production and little else. This is creativity? Listen to Interpol, Cat Power or David Gray, please."
5,Here's Why:,"Amy Lee has an amazing voice that can sound sorta creepy at times, but I have never heard anyone sing so well in my entire life(including famous people). What's good about it is that the songs don't point to just one issue, they let you think about what they are saying so that you can interpret it towards your life. The only thing I hate about this album is that it should just be called the Amy Lee show. Evanescence is said to be made up up of just Amy Lee and Ben Moody(he probably left 'cause most people think Evanescence is made of just Amy Lee.)- but what about the people who play th drums and the other instuments? I mean, really, it's not just about Amy Lee."
1,utter garbage,This band blows. Their album is crap. Their songs are mushy mixtures of rehashed power ballads with elements of neo-pop-contemporary-classicalism and a dash of female vox that are nothing spectacular if not normal. Drop this in the waste disposal and check out Lacuna Coil instead if all you are really intersted in is a band that has a chic singer that rocks.
3,There's better than this out there!,"Checked a few samples of this band out and was pretty disappointed - but am not writing this to slag a band or its fans, just to maybe point some of you to some other stuff I think towers above this group - you just gotta go find it! If you like goth-tinged, melodic metal with engaging female vocals, look no further than groups like The Gathering, Lacuna Coil or Flowing Tears - all Euro but readily available in the States. Seriously, all their recent releases put this to shame. I guess it's something about their European roots that lends their music such great emotive impact and depth. This was just too boring and heard-it-all-before for me, especially after spending so much time listening to the other bands I just mentioned. CHECK 'EM OUT - YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!"
1,"Turn it off, Beavis!","Is it just me or does this girl's voice go right through your head? I've heard other people say she's got such a wonderful voice, but whenever I hear it I have to turn it off. It is so whiny, I can't stand it...."
5,Terrific!,This is an amazing CD! A terrific combination of all of their styles.I would recommend this to anyone who is an Evanescence fan.
2,So?,"Hmmm. Nu-metal with better vocals. Well you can pour chocolate syrup over cow manure but how much better does it really taste? It's on par with a Creed album. To comapre it with Tori Amos is just silly. I keep hearing this hailed as some sort of ""gothic rock"" too. Huh? EvanEssence isn't awful, but they're nothing to get excited over."
2,why must everyone love it so?...,"its really not that good, and im not one of those people who hates something just cuz the band peoples are posers, its truly bad attempted music, and the singer cant even sing,YEP, evanescence sounds like a good idea but once you here it its just like, oh wow...that was pointlessthis band can go in the crap pile along with avril and limp bizkit"
2,next please,"I heard about this great new band, so I wanted to give them a listen, as I am constantly on the lookout for anything that's new and, especially, good. Once was more than enough though; they sound like highschool students trying to make a pizza for the first time with all the wrong ingredients. Absolutely without relevance or substance. Not poisonous, but I'm keeping my distance. Two stars because they honestly tried to make a good pizza; but they just haven't got what it takes to become three star chefs. Next please..."
3,palatable,"I dont agree with the previous critic totally. I agree that to some extent that they are like linkin park (who i liked until they became far too pop culture-y). There are some nice track on this abulm but some seem to be to similar and the first few times you listen to it you have trouble differentiating between the tracks due to that similarity. True it is the Amy Lee Show. If the rest of the band have any talent, then they dont get to show it at all. Hard rock fans should probably stay away from this."
2,Ugh,"Linkin Park mixed with Sarah McClaclan= Evanescence. Only thing is, those two don't mix well. I swear if I hear ""My Immortal"" on the radio one more time I'll hit a note (scream) higher than Amy Lee's whiny annoying voice has ever hit. I swear, it seems like the media is trying to shove this band down everybody's throats, and people are buying it. Bring Me To Life was good the first 10 times, but after that (at about the 323574th time its on the radio) it gets very old."
4,Awesome cd!,"This is a great album, I think it has done the best so far in the sense of integrating a good female voice with some Rocking tunes. I give this album 2 thumbs up!"
2,"So Close, Yet So Far","This album continues the trend of modern rock bands with sub-par instrumentals relying on catchy hooks to carry them. Drums often sound programmed, and even when there is real drumming it gets stale fast. I think the guitar tracks were all copied and pasted from a Linkin Park cd in Pro Tools. The bass, well, if you manage to hear it in the guitar noise you are a better man than I.After all of that, this band has some redeeming qualities. The vocals are gorgeous, and the songs actually sound original, even if the arrangments are stale. What makes this band so sad is that they really could be good, but they weren't willing to put out the effort to do something original... shame, shame, shame."
2,Pretty Good!!,"Evanescene's FALLEN , its amazing , I mean, I was going to give them 5 stars, but after listen to a band CALLED NIGHTWISH , my rate went down by far... if you love EVANESCENE , and you think their music blown you away , just give it a try to NIGHWISH'S albums OCEANBORN and WISHMASTER... and then you'll probably going to be like me... Evanescenes [is]horribe live...."
2,Amy Lee is Sexy and She Can Sing,"...But you'll be better off just getting the single ""Bring Me To Life"". The followup stuff is about as exciting as Heart in the mid 1980's- not very. ""Bring Me To Life"" is a great song I will give them that. But the clown that sings with Amy kind of ruins it. It would have been one the coolest songs in rock had they instead used Ozzy Osbourne in his place. The guy doing it makes me and my 16 year old little bro laugh our asses of everytime he says something during the song. And we haven't laughed so hard since Sheryl Crowe did ""Picture"" with Kid Rock."
2,Too Urgent,"I find this CD extremely difficult to listen to because of the ""urgency"" (sorry, but that's the most descriptive word for it) of nearly every song.That urgency makes it very fatiguing to listen to more than two songs."
1,Evanescence is a buch of jerks,"I am a student at University of California at San Digeo and I am really angry with Evanescence. I have their CD and i kinda liked it, but Forensik was supposed to open for them at SOMA at San Diego, and Evanescence just denied the for no reason. This is not a good thing. Forensik is a good band. I have heard their demo and they are going to go big once they get a record deal. Evanescence has made a big mistake not letting them play. I was supposed to be the penguin in the mosh pit and anyone that knows Forensik knows that they have awesome shows. Evanescence's CD is not all that good. They just got some good airplay on MTV which sucks because they are not that good of a band. Forensik is a much better band; they have really good talent. Contact me if you would like to know more about Forensik. DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!!go to http://www.forensikmusic.com/ for some good music. I repeat, DO NOT BUY THIS CD, go to Forensik's website and listen to their music."
5,Evan,The first time I heard this CD from my friend on our way New York I couldn't put it down. I had to listen to it during the whole trip. This is truly a great CD and I reccomend it anybody.
5,Completely bloody brilliant!,"This is an awesome album. I'm not what you would call a connosieur (sp?) of gothic rock, but it seems to me that this album fits under that label. I'm completely in love with the brilliant Amy Lee, who is not only gothically gorgeous but also has one of the most brilliant voices I've ever heard. My favorite songs are GOING UNDER, BRING ME TO LIFE, and MY IMMORTAL, but they are all brilliant. Go out and buy it immediately! That is an order!"
3,overrated but good,"this album is another MTV overrated album. even though is a thousand times beter than linkin park or limbizkit(if there is a difference between this bands)there still a missing creativity in the music. there are some good cuts here(the immortal, tourniquete,the haunted) whith her god given voice but the band in fact is too repetitive(nu-metal) and the song breng me to life is ruined by that stupid rapper but after all i'll recommend it"
3,my review on fallen - evanescence,"The reason i bought this CD was because of there no.1 hit, Bring Me To Life. Listening to this non-stop soon made it one of my favourite songs,so I bought the album. I listened to it but the songs weren't as good as Bring Me to Life. If you wanna waste 10 do it on this album."
3,It's ok...,"I'll admit: Evanescence is pretty good. Amy Lee has a powerful voice. But Evanescence just doesn't quite do it for me.First of all, their guitars are really weak. You can barely hear them! Maybe it's just me, but the way-too-simple chords and rhythms are boring, for lack of a better word. Plus, what is with that random guitar solo in ""Going Under""? That just bugs me.Second, Amy's voice stands out too much. Sure, she's got a good voice, but it's overpowering everything else until it's just her and nothing else. You can barely hear the guitars, bass and drums. All parts don't blend as well as they should, in my opinion.All in all, Evanescence isn't the worst band ever, they just need a little work. Maybe if they worked on their balance a little more, they could be at the top of my list. But for now, they're in the middle."
2,bored..,"The only song I like is Imaginary(specially the version from Origin). But if it wasn't for Imaginary, I would give this cd 1 star. Amy Lee's voice irritates me on most of the songs. It sounds..fake. Like she is wringing/twisting/bending her voice.And this isn't real gothic either(for the peeps who are labeling this as gothic).There are better bands out there, so don't hang on this one.EDIT: and oh yeah..raping My Tourniquet(Soul Embraced cover) is the worst part."
1,Rocky Gray,"The drummer for this band, Rocky Gray...is an incredible guitarist and used to play in Living Sacrifice and Soul Embraced. The song ""My Tourniquet"" was written and originally performed by Soul Embraced.As for Evanescence as a whole, I think it's pretty freaking cheap for a band to forsake what it stands for and buy into mediocrity."
2,more poseur crap cranked out by a major record label,"for years, the big record companies and radio stations (all owned, or almost all owned, by Clear Channel)work tirelessly to synthesize and mimic some type of 'scene'. in this case, the 'goth' music scene is what is being copied by some major label radio-friendly wanna be band. do yourself a favor, get the 'real deal' goth music: Christian Death, Bauhaus etc. This is poseur crap music!"
5,AWESOME,"Okay all i have to say is evanescence in my eyes is one of the best bands in the world. and if you don't like them then tough! THEY ABSOLUTELY ROCK! AMY LEE IS MY IDOL! and no i don't cut,>.<Her lyrics just speak to me, i mean i like the older stuff a little better but still they are my favorite band. Amy is so cool though (get the DVD) the guys are all very cool too. But mostly i just can't see why someone wouldn't like this band. Amy pretty much gets her lyrics from her life, which is pretty average like most peoples lives. Shes pretty much showing everyone else that they are not alone, but i have to say this cd was very good, when i first heard this cd i fell in love with it right away. So i recommend you buy it if you like rock and a girl with great vocals. EVANESCENCE ROCKS!!! :)"
2,"Some singles, but thats about all","You can listen this album from start to finish and think you'll just listened to the one song for 40 minutes. Unfortunantly, all the songs blend into one another and tho this album has the chart-topping singles 'My Immortal' and 'Bring Me To Life' thats about all it's worthy of.Personally, I've listened to it a couple of times and now I've ripped those two singles from the cd I listen to them in compilations with other songs on my computer, but the CD just sits and gathers dust."
5,awesome band,amy lee's sweet operatic vocals and ben moody's incredible guitar hook writing plus deep lyrics about pain are all a perfect combination of the musical masterpiece this album is. I'm glad real artists who play their own instruments and sing from the heart are still around cause evanescence has it
4,SOMETHING NEW...,"IF YOU ARE A FAN OF LINKIN PARK, YOULL DEFINETELY LIKE THIS BAND. WITH THEIR DEBUT ALBUM, EVANESCENCE PROVED THAT THEY CAN BE A REAL BAND AND THAT THEY DONT SELL OUT, LIKE MOST BANDS DO TODAY. WITH AN UNIQUE MELODY (HEAVY METAL AND ELECTRONIC COMBINED)AND DEEP LYRICS BY AMY LEE (GOD, FINALLY A CHIC...)THIS BAND HAS ALL THE POSIBILITIES TO SUCCEED IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY. BY THE WAY I THINK ITS A VERY GOTHIC BAND, IN THE SENSE OF MUSIC AND COSTUMES ALSO BY THE BAND, WHICH IM GETTING USED TO. MY FAVORITE SONGS ARE ""GOING UNDER"", ""TORNIQUET"", EVERYBODYS FOOL"", AND ""MY INMORTAL"".-AGUANTE LA ANARQUIA SAS 07!!!"
5,Amazing Album,"We all got a taste of Evanescence (excluding the lucky people in the Little Rock, Ark. area) on the ""Daredevil"" soundtrack with ""Bring Me to Life"" and ""My Immortal."" In my case, it was more than enough to get this album as soon as possible. Trust me, if you liked what you heard on Daredevil, you will not in any way be dissapointed. Ms. Lee hits the nail square on the head when she says their music is epic. Every song, with the exception of ""Hello,"" (which is in no way a bad song) has pure energy rushing through it. Another positive is that there are actually guitar solos in some songs...A definite rarity in today's nu-metal era. Not to mention Ms. Lee's vocals and lyrics are simply stunning. Its been a while since ive felt like i spent my money well on a CD. Favorite songs ""Going Under, Haunted and Tourniquet"""
4,Great female vocals,"Very good. Hard to categorize music style other than to compare to some similar acts like The Gathering, Lacuna Coil, Flowing Tears, and maybe Nightwish. Basically if you like the angelic voice of a female, the hardness of hard rock/metal, you'll like listening to this. Enjoy."
3,Mediocre band with a vocalist who deserves much better,"I have finally found the band's key flaws. After listening to many other bands, the main thing that sticks out about Evanescence is Amy Lee. Amy Lee is a fantastic vocalist. Nowhere near as good as Cristina Scabbia from Lacuna Coil or Tarja Tarunen from Nightwish, though. The other thing I noticed is how much the band sucks at played. Boring riffs, and many other problems. My dad was listening to it with me one time, and he easily tell what was coming next. He could tell that the next song would sound oh so similar. =/The slow, piano songs are the standouts. They showcase Amy's vocals highly. They also aren't polluted with the band.The only reason the rating isn't lower is because of Amy's vocals. It's a shame. With a better band backing her up, they could be something great."
2,Basically a re-issue,"Granted, very few people have heard Evanescence's previous album called ""Origin."" If they had, there would be very little reason to purchase this new album ""Fallen."" At least 4 tracks have been re-used from their former album, and all four have been ""improved."" The problem is that there was nothing really to improve. The tracks sounded perfectly good before, and with the addition of some violins here, some additional lyrics there, and a few other extras, they have been kind of watered down.That being said, there are SOME good tracks on this album. ""Going Under"" is interesting, and Amy Lee continues her string of excellent piano ballads with ""Hello.""...However, this album will undoubtedly sell well. With a hit single like ""Bring Me To Life,"" it would be a little hard not to. ....Anyway, I can't really say I recommend this album. I thought that Origin was so much better, and this one doesn't really stand on it's own without the additional tracks."
1,Overrated...Overrated...Overrated!!!!!!!,"The recording industry wants you to believe that this is what's happening, this is what is quality music. Fortunately for me, I don't buy in to all that nonsense. This is a horrible band, and all the songs I've heard were just rotten. As far as listenability goes, I give this one a big fat zero."
1,Gothlic Christians?,"I heard someone say these guys were Christians, but they look like gothlics...oh well it's not the image that matters (rappers have yet to figure that out) it's the music. And this music sucks. Period."
1,And now for something completely different...,"I'm embarassed that I own this album. Sorry, everybody. This is puerile, regurtitated cliche angst for the Tori-meets-Linkin-Park generation. Amy's voice is absolutely beautiful, yes, but the lyrics are cracking me up in a not-so-very-funny way. As it happens, the Daredevil soundtrack got the best of Evanescence's work."
3,Gothic soap operas,"Let me be clear -- the only difference between the goth scene and daytime soap operas is that the actors in soap operas know that they are playing deluded, sentimental, and overly dramatic characters; goths, however, don't seem to understand that they are narcissistic and delusional. They actually seem to believe that the sense of exceptionality they feel is authentic. Actually, let me revise what I just said. We can also compare the melodrama of goth to the bad ""hair"" bands of the '80s, though if one were to ask me to choose between the two, I would be hard pressed to choose the lesser of the two banalities.That said, this is a solid album precisely because it does a good job of doing what it sets out to do: make pretentious and melodramatic music seem to be ""deep.""Just a goth vocab primer if you need some brushing up:haunting: melodramaticdark: repetitive chords"
2,Whatever,"This is one of those albums that was fine after a few doses but then gets beaten into submission by radio and girls who have to play this every month ( If you know what I mean ). The fact that this is the go to in any situation that anyone I say ""rock"" to, is a disgrace. This album is a great one night stand but nothing more."
2,Once is enough.,"Fallen by Evanescence is a pop/rock album gone wrong. Amy Lee's vocals are good but then after you hear the songs again, her voice gets annoying and over-done, it is all too much to take in. My Immortal, Going Under, and Bring Me To Life just fade with time, I never want to hear those songs again. The only track with meaning is Everybody's Fool. Evanesence is one band I wish would go away!"
2,"No Creativity, Just an LP Rip!!!","ok, I've heard about 5 songs from this album, each of them sounds like either like X-Ecutioners & Linkin Park - It's Going Down, or Linkin Park - With You or With You (reanimation remix). Their guitars suck, that guy who's trying to be an emcee like Mike Shinoda from Linkin Park gets on my nerves. They may sound ""hot"" on a cd, but i bet they suck in concert. Don't waste your money on this unless you like this type of music."
5,excellent music,excellent music!I will buy more about Evane scene. I like this CD very much and I listen to it during driving every day!
5,Evanescence,Love this CD. I have had it for approximately three weeks. Not much more to say. Get it and you won't be dissappointed.
5,Awesome...,This CD is awesome; there is hardly anything else like it. Linkin Park and Green Day are both stupid as hell and have no reason to be listed with this CD.
5,Wow,One of the greatest CD's I have heard in a long time. Amy Lee has very strong and very powerful vocals. I definitely recommend this to anyone no matter what their taste in music is!
4,Evanescence-Fallen,I picked up this cd because of the two tracks on the Daredevil soundtrack that really made the cd worth getting. So when I got it I expected some good music and from top to bottom it doesn't dissapoint. With dark music and vocals Evanescence turns away from some of the other music that you would put in this kindda catagory. Bring me to life is still the best of all thier songs with my Immortal kindda taking a break from the harder rock that is on the other 10 tracks. Tracks like Haunted and whisper are darker and set more of what the band is about. I have been looking for darker music to listen to and Evanescence is a step in the right dirrection and that is what make this cd so enjoyable for me.
1,This could've been a lot better.,"My friends kept on telling me about this band on the Daredevil movie called Evanescence. They said it was really heavenly vocals over really heavy metal. I thought, cool. This sounds like something for me. A lot of bands I like have calm vocals over hard rck. (Queens Of The Stone Age, Cream, Masters Of reality)EH! Wrong!What we have here is yet another trendy, wannabe goth metal band that sounds too much like Linkin Park, Korn, Staind, the list goes on. This would've been cool if:A.The lyric wirter could've spent more time on the lyrics. (Save me from the nothing I've become? Heard it a million times, my friend!)B.The music had texture, and not a few chords meshed together to make a song.C.NO RAPPING!Anyway, I had hopes for this band. If you do like goth music, try Bauhaus, inventors of goth, or The Cure. Don't listen to this. It's not worth your money."
1,What's the big deal?,Evanescence offers nothing fresh to the already stale music industry. Most of their songs seem to have the same boring guitar parts and Amy Lee's voice is boring and not unique. I honestly can't believe people think their music is refreshing and unique!
1,this is garbage,"what is the big deal about this band.. is it because they have a female singer with a horribly annoying voice remenscent of nails on a chalk board?...or is it the crummy recycled power chord guitar riffs?.. please.. this band is a joke.. they are only popular due to the fact they play mainstreanm rock music with a female vocalist, don't be fooled"
1,How is it possible?,"How can it be that a recording with no melody, no rhythm, no tune, no variance in pitch, and nothing new lyrically... how can such a recording become a monster seller and command the accolades of the elite music press? Who is in bed with whom? Five Grammy nominations can't be wrong, you say? Sure they can - the Grammys are all about industry self-congratulation and attaboys for selling low-grade junk in volume.I have no issue with the angst of the band, but when it's the ONLY thing that they do at all (never mind whether they do it ""well""), then you're better off listening to NIN or some old Joy Division - at least those bands actually made music.Please skip this disc and put Evanescence out of our misery."
1,More Pathetic Mainstreem Crap,"How the heck did this band get so popular? Simple, Evanescence are nothin but another trendy band that sucks ass along with Avril Lavigne, Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, Puddle Of Mudd, Sum 41, Hoobastank, Fountains Of Wayne, and Blink 182. If you real music, look no further than Pantera, Down, Superjoint Ritual, Damageplan, Lacuna Coil, Slayer, Deicide, Killswitch Engage, Chimaira, Slipknot, Death, Lamb Of God, Metallica, Sepultura, Hatebreed, Shadows Fall, Morbid Angel, Cannibal Corpse, Obituary, Nile, and Suffocation."
1,what about listenning to real music works?,"---------> Dillinger escape plan, morning again,unearth, refused... Oh and an easy one for you noobs --> Killswitch engage, it's a good transition record to real music."
3,great pipes and tunes - until the rap kicks in,"I was astounded to hear Evenescence on the local radio. Actual melodies! A signer with some talent and a clue as to what key she should be in! Something that I've been happy find in the Euro Opera Metal scene (Nightwish, After Forever, Flowing Tears) is available in an American band! But then something caught my ear and really turned me off...what is up with that stupid rap in the background? It's bad enough that Linkin Park has to go down that route, but that doesn't mean everyone needs to jump on the idea. If you're playing rock, you don't need rappers, sampling, and scratching DJ's - Play your own music, not someone else's. I've knocked off 2 stars for the rap infusion."
5,The best i've ever heard...,"When I first heard the song in ""DAREDEVEL"", I was having goosebumps and I was so curious of who was singing that song...later in the same movie, immortal touch my heart, so when i got the album I was so pleased with it that i couldn't put it down, the harmonies of each song and the mystery of it you just can't put it down. I highly recommend this album, you won't be dissappointed, and is the best i've ever heard....i can't wait what the group will have next!!.....my favorites are, Bring back to life, my immortal,tournoquet."
3,Nothing special,"I expected a lot from this record, so I was dissapointed after I listened to it. All the songs are similar. I'm not saying Evanescence suck, because they really don't. They are just pretty overrated. Amy Lee has a nice voice, but it's nothing special. I could claim that mine is just as nice as hers. There are millions of singers like her. There are few good tracks on ""Fallen"". I personally like ""Going Under"" and ""My Immortal"" very much, even though radio stations world wide have raped them, but the music doesn't touch my heart at all. I'm afraid that Fallen is going to be the only succesful album from Evanescene. They have a lot of potential. But don't call Evanescence metal, because they aren't;). There are two European female fronted metal bands I find very professional and wonderful: Nightwish from Finland and After Forever from Holland. Try them; you won't be dissapointed! Nightwish's Tarja's voice is just so beautiful. She's a professional opera singer, btw."
4,Gothic Success!,"I personally favor this sound of music. Though some may argue it is depressing music, it shines in its own way and I admire that. I'm glad to see a female vocalist like Amy Lee come along and straighten up the girl music scene a little bit more realistically than other previous female singers. At least she sings and never lip synchs. And those of you who think this is terrible music, think differently about this years album, please. Amy's old band mate Ben, whom was responsible for most of these so-called ""depressing"" songs left the band and now Amy finally gets a chance to have more of a say in what kind of lyrics are written. So, I don't think you've heard all their is from Evanescence, and to me... I like that idea. You rock Amy Lee!!!P.S. For certain people (like me)depressing music cheers them up."
2,"Okay, but quite overrated...listen to something else","Dont get me wrong. This is good for starters, but PLEASE do not think that this is the best gothic metal band around.There are better bands out there that Evanescence have just ripped off, such as Lacuna Coil and Nightwish. Bands such as these deserve the REAL credit as being accomplished. And LC were there BEFORE Evanesence, so please talk some sense those people who constantly say that it's the other way around.This is an okay start, but for more diversity and symphonic metal, check out Lacuna Coil, Nightwish and Therion. Don't listen to those posers who slit their wrists and say, 'OMG! It says my suicide! OMG it's so gothic!' Because they're WRONG."
5,Not just for young punks!,"As a 30 yr old fan of main-stream ""alternative"" rock (of which I hate the genre title) I must say this is one INCREDIBLE CD! This album is raw emotion coupled with a sensitive yet edgy sound. For those who enjoy music for its artistic impression this is THE sound. Amy Lee's voice will stop your heart and take you inside her head leaving you waiting for her next breath of song. In a sea of whining, leftover, grunge rejects and wannabees this sound is far deeper and meaningful than the teen herds give them credit. Evanescence is not just another Linkin Park, Godsmack, or (dare I say) Fred Durst...they actually get what rock music is about, and clearly show how music, even ""alternative"", can really move and inspire."
5,Expected One Good Song,I bought this CD because there was this one song I couldn't get out of my head. I spent the money thinking I'd probably only like one or two songs at most...but I was almost instantly in love with the whole CD.If you liked 'Bring Me To Life'...then buy this CD. At least half the album is comprised of songs with the same style and attitude. The ballads add some variety to the CD and they quickly win you over with her pure vocal talent.
1,"dark, cold, depressing, awful","I thought this CD was great... until I looked up the lyrics on the internet. After the first three songs I quit, thinking that maybe I didn't want to know them after all. I'm starting to wonder if Amy is suicidal!! EVERY song is about bleeding, dying, screaming, cutting, killing... you name something dark, depressing, and scary, it's in there! I'm just about to turn fourteen and I swear, not much scares me, but I just froze with fear when I heard someone screaming in the background of song number six, ""I WANNA DIE!!!"" The only reason I could think of liking this CD is if you are depressed and are looking for someone who feels the same way you do. Or you could just completely ignore the lyrics (which is hard to do) and enjoy the electric guitar and her voice (which in spite of her suicidal attitude, really is amazing). After hearing that scream in the background I threw my CD in one of my closet drawers and locked it up. I'm never going to listen to it again."
2,What is wrong with everyone ?,"This is typical, watered down version of the European goth-pop-metal. Lyrics are simple and childish, songs tediously similar in form. Band performance is medicore. Amy Lee can sing, but her voice is still pretty ordinary. I just can not understand how anyone can think Evanescence as ""exceptional and unique"". There is nothing exceptional here. If american music industry can sell something to the kids, that is not a any sign of quality at all.And finally a friendly advice;for reviewer ""Alexander M. Zamora"", go to Google and search for the band called ""Nightwish"". Go to the website and listen to the samples.And same to the all of you who keep telling Evanescence lyrics ""are deep and meaningfull"". Go to the Nightwish homepage and read the lyrics.Nightwish songwriter guy - non-native english speaker, middle of the woods somewhere in northern Europe writes lyrics that blow away almost anyone else around the world. And that definetly includes Amy Lee."
5,Bought it after hearing 2 sec on the radio,"I love it still. One of the few albums that you can actually listen to over and over. Just Awsome. great metal, great singing perfect simulatneous contrast of sounds."
4,Gothic Rock/Pop,"This is a solid CD and every track is a poppy sensation. However, there is a serious lack of depth characteristically found in any Gothic production. I'm assuming Evanescence is a Gothic Rock band because of obvious reasons (getup, sound, etc). The female vocalist sounds strangely the same as Cristina Scabbia from Lacuna Coil, an Italian Gothic Metal band that you guys should all listen to. I recommend Tristania and Theatre of Tragedy as well. This is a great debut effort, and I'm happy that Evanescence has captured a sound that makes the Gothic genre very assessible to the general public. We'll see how they evolve in their sophomore release."
4,Excellent recording effort...,"This recording is definately something that I have never heard of before! The sound is just astronomical! Amy and the rest of the band have a sound unlike anything else out there. The songs really make someone look at themselves and the lives that they lead. This is not by any means a ""feel good"" record. There are no catchy, pop songs on this record at all...and sometimes that is just what someone needs to hear. You will definately come away after listening to this record saying...WOW!!Here is a breakdown of all the songs.1. Going Under 5/52.Bring Me To Life 5/53. Everybody's Fool 4/54.My Immortal 5/55. Haunted 4.5/56. Tourniquet 5/57. Imaginary 4/58. Taking Me Over 4/59. Hello 5/510. My Last Breath 4/511. Whisper 4/5Out of a total of 55 points (5 points for each song max.) I gave this CD 49.5 which comes out to 90%=A-. Great recording...hope to hear more from this band....only question...where do they think that this is a Christian Group??? Hmmm...."
3,"liked it at first, then...","Ok, Amy can sing most people off the stage, but there is something irritating about her voice after a while, too sweetly strident? Too Pat Benatar? Too spooky? Maybe I'm too old. Maybe we are all spoiled now by the sensuous quality of Norah Jones, the sweetness of Eva Cassidy, or the grown-up magnificence of Mary Fahl (who, if you have not heard of her yet,is right up there with the great gals previously mentioned. Her new record ""The Other Side of Time"" wowed me.) Sorry Evanescence, I can only give you 3 stars."
2,They play rock at church now?,"Yes, I know they're a religious group. However, that doesn't mean electric guitars and a choir singing in the background belong together. She has an awesome voice...but if you're going to be in the rock category, please think of something other than this. It's a waste of time."
3,Great?,This is the rock album which anyone could ever hate. even the vedeos are undefined. i guess? but still it's entertaining.
5,Fallen bloody rocks!,"Fallen is probably one of the best albums around. Its original and the lyrics will relate to many people.A stupid reviewer (probably the reviewer below me) said it was total crap but i think she/he is completely wrong!The lyrics are different in every song and if you give it a GOOD listen to, the lyrics are unique and original. That reviewer was too harsh and they need to buy more CDs before they diss Evanescence.To fellow buyers on Amazon and everywhere else give it a try and see for your self cos you will be addicted after one listen (if you like it of course!)"
1,Please these people just copy Linkin Park,"There is no one who can take this group seriously. they so copied a bunch of linkin park gutair riffs and stuff like that.Take ""Bring me to Life"" starts off with the piano (as in In the End by Linkin Park) Then goes into the background gutair riff(as in Pts. of Authority by Linkin Park) Then copies the gutair riff of dont stay by guess who linkin park. then sends in a poser rapper after the part wake me up.(making it sound like a discrace to linkin park.) dont buy this cd. Then in ""Going Under"" so copies the gutair riffs of with you by guess who LINKIN PARK. So dont by this. ..."
1,PERFECT CD IF...,"Your one of those people who dress ""gothic"" and walk around the mall looking depressed even though your life is perfect and you have $100 in your pocket."
3,THIS IS A WONDERFUL SUPRISE PPL,"ok ok so the concerts are bad and Amy's voice is fake. i only bought this CD in the first place cause they were SOOOOOOOOO popular at my school and I HAD to find out what all the fuss was about. My favorite songs are: Bring me to life, Going under and Tourniquet. most of the other songs aren't very good though."
4,Not your everyday female-led band.,"Where should I begin? This was one of those might-as-well-try-it purchases at the local Wal-Mart. I'd heard ""Bring Me To Life"" on the radio a few times and it definitely sounded good among all the Staind and Limp Bizkit crap the radio usually plays. So I bought it. The heavy tracks are great, the singer/piano songs are okay, nothing is truly bad. ""Tourniquet"" has proven to be my favorite song on the record. Some call the guitarist untalented and relying on single-finger power chords, pedals, and distortion, but I say ""So What? It works doesn't it?"" Indeed it does. I'd recommend this to anyone tired of the same old song and dance."
1,Goth emo with no hooks,"Evanescence is the textbook example of a band becoming extremely popular only because they are shoved down the throats of all who watch MTV or listen to pop radio stations. Fortunately I don't watch MTV and rarely listen to the radio. The truth of the matter is the entire band is talentless. They peddle the same power cords and simple piano melodies in every song. The only bright spot is the lead singer who does manage to show that she does have some vocal talent. What she needs to do is drop the losers she's with and begin singing something that people might actually remember in 5 years.""Fallen"" is nearly your typical nu-metal offering in the same vein as Linkin Park except it lacks any of the hooks that made Linkin Park songs bareable. Save yourself some time and money and this one pass to the wayside of soon-to-be-forgotten over hyped pop music."
1,the truth,"Linkin Park-rap+GOOD singer=still a terrible band. Get your own sound, or at least rip off a better band!"
1,...,"This CD is horribly marred by the guy's rapping in the background of the single ""Bring Me to Life"". How anyone could take such a beautiful song and absolutely ruin it is beyond me. When listening, I become enraged when I hear this jerk in the background. Avoid at all costs."
1,What A Disappointment,"When I heard ""Bring Me To Life"" on the radio, I was thrilled. I thought a new band had broken through with a fresh sound. I bought the CD and I was totally disappointed. Yes, the single is an awesome song, but the rest of the CD is lacking. Every song sounds exactly the same and the only variation is the tempo. Amy Lee has an amazing voice but she needs better songs to sing. A lot of this material sounds recycled from the early 90's. The urgency and the rawness of ""Bring Me To Life"" is void on every other song. This band seems doomed for a permanent place in the Kingdom of One Hit Wonders."
2,Nothing Special,1. Going Under 4/52. Bring Me To Life 5/53. Everybody's Fool 2/54. My Immortal 1/55. Haunted 1/56. Tourniquet 2/57. Imaginary 5/58. Taking Over Me 2/59. Hello 3/510. My Last Breath 2/511. Whisper 2/5Maybe This Isn't My Type Of Music..Whether You Get It Or Not Is Totally Up To You. Good Luck.
4,Fallen... well maybe out of place for the radio,"Evanescence has potential as a band. I listen mainly listen to progressive rock and metal. There are great bands out there like Blind Guardiad, Dream Theater, Symphony X, Iced Earth, and so on. Evanescence could be just as good... but will they want to make music or sell?Anyway, the album overall is great. The songs are more complexly structured than most anything you'd hear on the radio, and I love the paino.""Bring Me to Life"" is the radio hit that was made for radio. I can't say much more... that's why the rap deal is present.""Haunted"" appears to be the best song on the album, and it even has a nice guitar solo (tear forms in the edge of eye).Evanescense can be a great band and hopefully will not fall to radio standards. I'm waiting for another release."
3,Band was good... Amy's voice is TERRIBLE live!!,"i liked the guitars and double- drums, but Amy's voics sucked. She kept having to catch her breath from jumping around so much, and her vowel formations were WAY off. I'd know. I've been in chorus almost a full school year. I love ""missing"" though. Very addictive."
1,this sucks,"I got this album as a christmas gift, and i have to say it sucks! The lead singer of the band is terrible, and could not sing at all. I sound better on the toilet than she sings. the guitar work on this album is boring as hell, and the songs dont sound good at all. buy linkin park if you want to hear real music. this sucks! I wish i could give it no stars. i soldthis cd about three days after i got it. i never even wanted it anyway, but somehow i got it"
2,Bring me back to reality,"It's depressing when your favorite band never makes it. It's even MORE depressing when a band comes along and completely rips of your favorite band and makes it. When I heard Evanescence, I didn't know what to think. They sounded like Joydrop with a singer whom only had a tiny portion of the talent that Tara Slone holds. This music is a shame! I even downloaded most of the tracks from the CD to give it a fair chance. Still nothing. How can they be called good, let alone ORIGINAL? For the love of God, please buy one of Joydrop's CDs before even thinking of buying this one. Believe me-- it's like choosing chocolate cake over an M&M."
3,Over played--if not for that would be good...,"Fallen by Evanescence is an okay CD. I am not a real big fan of the band and can't stand that they are played so much on the radio. They are overplayed here where I live which has lost a lot of fans. I used to like the music and the CD but now I have heard the songs so much that it just irritates me. I admit their music isn't bad and maybe in like three years I will be over the fact that they are overplayed but as of now I wouldn't buy this CD if you are tired of hearing them on the radio, but, if you can still sing the songs on the radio and enjoy them then this CD is for you!"
2,umm... I disagree...,"OK- here's the deal.. if you were expecting some sick tori amos-linkin park fusion band.. look somewhere else. this CD starts out PERFECTLY, with Bring me Back to Life, but... it only goes downhill from there. Bring me back to life is the only hard song on this cd, the rest of it is a depressing tori amos type twisted [stuff]... no offense to tori. but after track number 2.. the track falls to about a 5/10. and it only gets sappier and sappier. truly not the album i was expecting. this is NOT a rock album.. but if you are looking for an emotionally saddened and cushy-mushy filled album, then GO FOR IT! but if you just like the sound of their first, and hopefully only, single ""bring me back to life"" then just get the single.. it is a one and only track like it on the whole cd. so like i said before.. i disagree with everyone else.. pretty much."
1,Let's point and laugh,"Evanescence is the illegitimate child of Nightwish and Lacuna Coil, filtered of any life for mass consumption. (Even moreso for the latter.) The real kicker is that none of the bands this is derived from are any good.Amy Lee has to be the most overrated vocalist of the millennium. She doesn't sound dark or ""mysterious,"" nor is she talented. Her singing is glorified pop vocals with a superficial melancholic edge, no doubt processed beyond recognition.I once heard that 1 out of every 8 pennies, or some ridiculous statistic, has passed through someone's system at some point. If bands were coins, Evanescense would definitely be a stinkpenny.- Thus says the Pellington"
1,Enough already!,"Thanks to Clear Channel, ""Back To Life"" is aired on the radio at least 3 times per hour.I'm sick of it! Please just go away."
3,Fine I guess...,It was alright and different... number 4 was pretty good... you will have to listen to the CD to really judge it for your self... I mean the CD isn't bad but I don't know if I would recomend it...
5,Soothing for the soul.,"Much has been made of Fallen, the first mainstream for Evanescence.I have followed this band for some time now, through Origin and their EPs.I write this not to add to the wonderful words which have already been mentioned about Fallen - but rather to make a recommendation. There are some extremely rare demos which will hopefully be making an appearance in an album called ""Not For Your Ears"".While My Immortal and Hello pierce the soul, a track on there called ""You"" - a personal song from Amy to Ben will captivate, enchant and delight you, and leave your soul yearning for more - something which only the angelic vocals of Amy can fulfill."
5,Essence of Buffy,"There's no doubt that Fallen could have been the soundtrack for Buffy the Vampire Slayer. From the first note, this CD evokes the same haunt-y mood and some of the lyrics could have been penned by Joss Whedon himself. . .they are that good. I've never owned a CD packed so full of 'listenable' tracks. It was quite a surprise to find the whole Buffy/Spike dynamic recreated in my headphones. That was a treat I never expected to find in a product so far removed from the Buffyverse.Fallen is destined to melt in my CD player."
1,twisted,"I got this cd ... and was totally blown away with the lyrics(they are played on a christian tv station)they are NOT what you think they are. they claim they are christians but they are not a christian band. im a christian and if i was in a band you can bet it would be a christian one. christians dont sing about ""saving"" themselves, its all about jesus/god. He is the only one who can save you"
1,DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This band sucks. Lacuna Coil are better, came before, and are not instant sellouts. DEATH TO EVANESCENCE, MOST OVERHYPED BAND OF 2003!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"dude, you wanna go to the evanescense concert tonight?","you're going to the evanescence concert tonight?...yeah,dude, they're totally rad...yeah, i've been into them since like october...oh dude, i would go but i gotta cut some s*** out of the paper....yeah, a recipe for apple brown betty, and a really funny family circus...pj mispronounces spagehtti...oh, he...what? oh, he calls it ""pis-seti""...and get this, he calls meatballs ""meat bulbs""! ha....i know, i know, that's why it's going on the fridge..."
1,"Try 12 stones,kutless,or38th parallel instead","If you are looking for a great christian cd, this one isn't it! I wouldn't recommend this cd to anyone especially a christian who thinks this band is a Christian band, they are NOT! I bought this cd thinking that it sounded cool until I read the lyrics. The lyrics are very disturbing. Especially since the lead singer of the band, Amy Lee claims that they are christians, just not a christian band. It makes you wonder about that when you read her lyrics. 12 stones, Kutless, 38th parallel are some great christian bands that don't compromise where there lyrics are concerned. Or if you are into the bands that aren't christian bands, but they claim to be christians, try lifehouse, p.o.d, or blindside. You wont find anything in there songs about the godess of imaginary light. Overall it is creepy freaky and very disturbing. There is definetly better things out there. I don't think this is what God ment when he said to be In the World, Not of It."
5,My New Favorite Band!,"It's easy to get discouraged about mainstream music just by listening to the radio. I've been there. I was at the point of giving up when I heard Evanescence's single ""Bring Me to Life"".It didn't catch me right away... it was good, but not mindblowing. Still, I was intrigued enough to give the rest of their stuff a listen. It was the rest of the album that got me hooked on them. I'd finally found some interesting music being played on the radio!The talent and musicianship of the group is obvious when listening through the album, and you can't deny that Amy Lee's vocals are absolutely gorgeous. It's honest, emotional music, with that dark edge to it that keeps it from getting too sappy (i.e. Staind, Creed, Nickelback...).If you want GOOD music, with a heart, soul, and backbone, please don't miss out on Evanescence. You won't regret it."
5,wow,"First off let me just say that I'm blown away at the quality of Amy's voice. For anybody that has studyed in any voice or chorus class, you can really appreciate the resonance in her voice. And if I read one more review saying that they sound like linkin park, i'll scream. I'll admit that Bring me to life has similarity to them in certain aspects, but that's about it. Obviously you haven't listened to the whole CD. The emotion behind the lyrics is so evident, and true musicians can appreciate the instrumental aspects of the album. If you know how to listen to music then get this CD, it'll give you chills and get your heart pumping."
3,The songs are more promising standing alone,"The band definitely shows potential, but the sound becomes highly repetitive. The song ""Bring Me To Life"" for which they became famous is clearly a sample of their potential, and several other works (such as the opening track) stand out pretty well outside of the context of the album. But when you put them together, the album starts to sound repetitive, largely due to the guitar work.On the side, their piano-driven balads, like ""My Immortal"", show high promise as well. As a whole, the album demonstrates the potential they have as a collective and serves as a showcase for Amy Lee's strong voice (her gothic style is rather fascinating too, filling up a rather interesting void in today's ""pop"" rock scene), but they need to reach beyond what they showed this time around. I am sure they have more tricks hiding in their hat..."
5,This was Wonderful!,"This was wonderful! This lady knows her stuff. I have her music cd's on healing for pets and animals-they are wonderful, too!"
1,Not really much help,"This book contains most of the scales, in every key, as well as most of the important chords to be used in jazz improvisation. What it doesn't contain is any guidance as to HOW to improvise successfully. While some might argue that improvisation, by definition, is something you make up yourself, I believe that a few examples would be very helpful to a beginner musician (after all, who else would want to buy this book?). Another thing, this book amazingly doesn't contain the Blues scale. Big mistake! In summing it up, I'd rather pay a few dollars more for something that lives up to its title."
1,Order rcvd.,I received the order yesterday only because I botched about it. I PAID for 2day shipping and it took 5. The holster is plain and the paddle does.t work as.well as most others. You get what you pat for.
3,Not Recommended,"I received this printer On October 7, 2004. Initial results on my photo quality labels was impressive. But it didn't last. Soon the printer had problems pulling the paper into the printer and then alignment on my labels was off. Yesterday I printed some checks on cheque paper and the printing was not well aligned, i.e. crooked. I hope to return this item."
2,"""One of the worst and loudest printer""",This is one of the loudest printer I have ever bought. I bought this printer because it was a photo printer and I needed one. This printer is so loud. This printer also gets the paper jamed. I bought a Epson C84 inkjet printer and it is so quiet and fast. I recommend the Epson Stylus C84 instead of the Hp 7260 printer.
1,"Need a Reliable printer? Look elsewhere, no durability here","I've had the HP Photosmart 7260 for about one year and have experienced similar problems: Cradle sticking, Paper jamming, etc. Envelopes never print straight.Last night the printer decided to no longer accept the ink cartridges (which are new) and the cradle is stuck. I expect a printer to last longer than this and was dissapointed given the repuation of HP.This wouldn't be such a problem, but I operate a small home business relying on this printer and this is more than inconvenient. I wish these corporations could stand behind a product."
1,HP did not bother to provide full functionality with Win7!,"HP and other companies talk about costumer service and ask costumers to use the same brand inks and things like this. But on the other, when a new OS comes out, they do not bother to produce the same set of tools for the new OS. In this case, if you upgrade to Win7, you are no longer able to see ink level and ask the printer to clean the cartridge because, the new HP toolbox does no longer have service option! So get rid of your printer and buy a new HP! This and many other dirty tricks from HP made me put HP in the black list for printers."
1,hp printer 7260,I was not pleased with this product.It was beat up and there wasn't any software or ink cartridges with the product that was to be with the printer.So I was unable to make the printer work without the software program.I wish I could get some feedback support on how to get my money back from this product.Thank you.Unhappy Don.
3,not bad for what I paid,I got this printer new for $50 over a year ago and I am pretty happy with it as far as printing photos go. It would be a lousy printer if it was the only one I had and I needed to print out other jobs because it tends to print one page then I have to go through a bunch of troubleshooting to get it to do another page. I only print occasional photos on this printer and it does beautiful work there. I am also amazed that the ink that came with it is still being used after all this time. My previous inkjet printer was an Epson and the ink would dry up if I didn't print something once a week.
5,One of the best,"I have read many waterfowl hunting books over the years, some good, some bad, and some great. This book is truely one of the great ones. Worth does a magnificent job writing about the birds we love and all that is great about gunning them!"
5,Life a Complete Operating Manual,I am not quite done with this book because I am savoring every morsel. This book is what I needed to explain and guide what I have felt for years. I love the writing style of this author because it is easy to understand and her humor is exquisite. I recommend this book highly but to be enjoyable it must be read with an open mind.
2,Way too big!! Check the size of your keyboard,"This is an okay bag - certainly not bad for the price. But, it's huge!! The bag is 36""x 14""x 5"". My keyboard (49 key - which is on the small side) is 28""x 8""x 2.5""!! My keyboard swims inside. Not very good for protection.I don't know how anybody could say this is good protection for a keyboard this size. I'm returning it. After checking, seems to be the size lots of other ""49 key"" cases are. Check your keyboard's measurements."
2,What 49-key keyboard?,"I bought this for the combination of good comments and good price.The bag is sized for a very specific keyboard, it seems.IT doesn't fit any 49 keyboard I know and most 61's.THe provider, Musician's Friend wants me to repack it and pay for the UPS shippingif I want a refund. It doesn't make any sense.Oh, the bag? it would be an OK bag if it could fit anything snugly."
4,It does its job,"Protective, but too big for many midi controllers. Wish it included a removable section divider to keep the instrument planted in one half of the case."
1,Musicians Friend has issues with shipping.,"I just called on this case, which i was supposed to receive earlier this week. It was stuck in processing, so will arrive at the end of NEXT week. This is pretty bogus, and i received zero information about the delay. Had i not called, it would have been stuck in the processing queue for ever probably."
4,Out there but excellent,"A must read for anyone who can't quite shake the feeling that we're all being taken for a ride. The prose is excellent, if exotic, and while certain characters aren't developed as much as one might hope, Grand's storytelling abilities are strong and make for a vastly enjoyable read.This book is probably not for everyone. An open mind may be essential. If you're living in New York and suspect you may be working too much, this book will resonate."
3,well written but unambitious,"I got taken into this work because the writing is so good, but when I finished the book I wondered what the point of it all was. I get the whole grey-flannel suit metaphor and I was alive when all the news about Howard Hughes's last days made the news so I think I more or less grasped the point of this novel, but it seemed so unambitious and the metaphor for all us working stiffs didn't really take me anywhere very interesting. And, the ending seemed to get pasted on in a hurry as if the author suddenly ran out of interesting things to do with his characters. So, a disappointment overall, but the sentence-by-sentence writing was quite good and I would certainly take a look at this author's later books. After all, I felt the same way about _The Broom of the System_, and look where that led!"
2,"Whatever, and I mean that in a good way","This book doesn't describe alienation - it is alienation. Fromcharacters who become familiar and yet are still nondescript to a plotthat unfolds but doesn't involve, reading Louse is like watching life go by from your window. If you want to read a better book in a similar vein, read The Physiognomy by Jeffrey Ford, which manages to both draw compelling characters and make a wide ranging commentary on modern life."
2,"gleaming, perfect surface","Louse suffers from an all-pervasive and sometimes overwhelming attention to surface. Unfortunately, beneath the gleaming, perfect surface the book presents, is a rather dull, contrived and merely half-conceived story. The author is facile, there is no doubt of that. His facility, however (with form, with phraseology, with tonality), does not overcome the relative clumsiness of the actual story.Designed more to seduce than to deliver, this book left me bored and empty. All those pages, all those words; nothing said."
4,good Ideas and Shows Scientific Method Well,Added to Library with other books to help communicate ideas and thoughts to kids. Variety in communicating is a great way to see other angles to help kids figure out how things work.Great Help for kids to learn how to apply them selves for Science Projects
4,Islamic Values by Tabbarah,"""The Spirit of Islam: Doctrine and Teachings"" by Afia A.

4,Replacement P-C battery,This battery seems to be just like the original equipment battery. I hope that it lasts 10 years.
4,Porter Cable Battery,"Battery works great. Needed charging as do most new batteries. Packaging was inadequate: box very large for size of battery, air bags were flat, battery loose inside outer box. Plastic cover around battery protected it from damage. Very expensive battery."
1,Replacement battery,Had to replace identical battery (would not hold charge) after very limited use that came with my drill.
1,Skip this movie if you value your time!,"Good story line, but there are many other similar movies out there that do a much better job. This movie has just about the worst acting I've ever seen. Ever. Do yourself a favor and skip this one ~ save your money and time."
3,Menia zovut...?,"One of the best qualities of Arbatova's proze is the fact that it is very to read. Most of her writing is done on the ""stream of consciousness"" level. I first read ""menia zovut zhenshina"" about a year ago. I have re-read it since. It is a lovely collection of stories, all true-to-life accounts of what life was really like for millions of Russian women, from abortions to clothes queues. My favourite is the last story of Natalia Goncharova. Very delicately written."
4,Look again!,"For those protesters out there, this is a series of NOVELS. Sure, like many NOVELS, they're based on something else, in this case the last book of the Bible. Read them as novels and stop whining.The story is riveting. I had seen the two movies first, so found the first book, LEFT BEHIND - the adult version, long and drawn out. Thus, the 4 rating. I probably won't buy any more of the books. I did, however, send the first copy of the Kids' version, TAKEN, to my grandtwins for their birthday. [Don't know how they got away with using the name, TAKEN, as there's already a TV mini-series with that name, available here on Amazon.]"
5,Vampires makes you laugh!,"I saw tthis fantastic cartoon movie many years ago. It is a fabulous tale of the vampire-rat mafia in Havana. They run an underground solarium, very profitable, as the vampires cannot go to the beach..Enter the old scientist, who has invented something that makes the vampires stand the real sun - VAMPISOL! The mafia wants to stop this product from being commercialized, as it will ruin their business.Lean back and enjoy, it is hilarious!"
3,What a Great Romantic Film,"If you happened to be a romantically challenged person like myself, Then ""Hitch""sounds like the best movie worth seeing. There are some parts of the movie where I laughed and laughed some more This was a Brilliant film for Will Smith-who is known for bringing moviegoers out of the heat-and into the wll air-conditioned screens of indoor multi-plexes during the hot summer months. Kevin James was great in his big-screen debut, Look for him doing movies whenever His Show, ""The King of Queens"" goes off the air. Eva Mendez looks absolutely great She'll probably be THE sexiest woman... Alive! She is so HOT!!! One of the best parts of this film happens to be Will drop-kicked Eva into the harbor as they headed off to Ellis Island. This is indeed a good date film You won't be totally disapppointed!"
3,An Okay Way to Spend Two Hours...James & Mendes Shine!,"Will Smith will always be Will Smith in his movies. His personality is getting old to me, but thankfully Kevin James (the new John Candy) and Eva Mendes (she has the you can't take your eyes off her exotic look...smoking hot!) save this film. Most of the funny scenes are the ones you see in the previews and the funniest of them all is the second dance scene that happens right before the end credits. This is a great date film that most guys will enjoy too. A little happy-sappy in parts, but there is enough relationship humor to keep it interesting."
4,Great Valentine's Present,"This DVD has some scenes that remind us of our wedding in Long Island. Got it at a good value, delivered right on time, and arrived in perfect condition. No problems."
4,Kevin James need to be in more movies.,I would love to see Kevin James starring in more movies solo. They are starting to use Kevin James as an supporting actor right now.
3,Lots of Laughs,Movie was so funny! Watched it a few times. Quality of the CD was good. No pauses or anything that messed up the screening of it.
3,Its not worth buying,"Hitch is one of those movies youll watch once. From the adds it look hilarious, but when you get to watching it its not much. Its about a date doctor called Hitch (Will Smith), who helps people make it to their first kiss. He, just like his clients, has problems with women. He doesn't want to get committed. But one day he meets a lady whos also not wanting to get committed, and they begin going on. On the side of this Kevin James's character meets this famous and rich person and needs help getting her to notice him, so he calls up Hitch. The funny parts are with Kevin James and and sometimes with Will Smith, but really, there's not many parts youll laugh at. So save your money, and dont buy this. Just rent it."
2,Skip it,"So I heard this was funny, and a girl/guy movie both could enjoy, well more girl than guy. But even through it had its funny parts it was overshadowed by sappy lines and actions that are unrealistic. You can't ""escape"" into this movie, nore would you want to, for watching it wasn't too enjoyable. The only main positive part of the movie, (its not Will Smith or the girl he is after), but more Kevin James (Albert)Amber Valletta (Allegra) whose characters and acting ablities are more funny, pleasant and natural to watch."
3,nice romance comedy..but cheesy metaphoric ending,"This movie was great and had some great messages to send BUT the ending was horrible. It was nice to see Albert and Allegra get back together, but the ending with Hitch going to her apartment was cheesy and bland. It was rid with cheesy metaphors and bland, non-creative dialogue. Its an allright movie to add to your romantic comedy collection."
5,Funny and sweet movie,"I would reccomend this movie to any romantic comedy fan. Will Smith does an excellent job as a guy, who we come to find out, is as clueless about dating as he thinks women are. And Kevin James convinces us well of his role as the clumsy lovable, teddy bear. It has comedy and alot of heart! One of my favorite Will Smith movies."
4,Not quite as funny as I thought !,"Another fine Will Smith movie, that has some real dull spots with nothing but talk.Kevin James sometimes would disappear for long periods of time and he was the comedic presence in this movie.Not a movie that you really want to watch again !"
5,"One of my favorite ""chick flicks""","I actually purchased this as a gift for my sister because she had borrowed mine and was upset when I took it back. Fun, feel good movie."
5,LOVE WILL SMITH,"THIS MOVIE TO ME IS A CLASSIC, NICE FAMILY DRAMA/COMEDY AND THE REST OF THE CAST WAS ALSO GOOD IN THIS MOVIE."
4,Hitch [Blu-ray],"This would be one of two BD titles I would reccomend for demo's. The movie is recent, the content is tame and very bright. So if you are watching on a projector or some other form of hi res screen, you can actually see the difference. The other movie that falls into this same description is 50 first dates. The good thing about both is that they are shipping now!"
4,Wonderful Comedy!,I really suprised to see such a wonderful performance from Will Smith. It is a very good comedy. Hitch (Will Smith) is a date doctor and gets always lousy guys who wants very hot and young ladies. He helps them to achieve their objective. But the last client was the guffiest accountant (Kevin James) and he wants inaccessible beauty named Allegra (Amber Valetta). They start to work together and somehow miracle happens. It is a comedy that you can watch it many times and laugh again and again.
2,TERRIBLE MOVIE WITH WONDERFUL SURPRISE ENDING,"This movie has three parts Will Smith - you just slide, you just slide, wild wild west, gettin' jiggy withit - one part Queen of Kings fat guy with funny black-guy-shows-fat-white-guy-how-to-dance scene. The scene is funny cuz white guys don't know how to dance, get it? Ha ha. And finally, this movie has one part -fill-in-the-blanks here today, gone later today, female actors portraying various romantic interests...But the best part of this movie is the surprise ending! As it turns out, ""Hitch"" - Will Smith - is dead! He's really just a ghost - the ghost of Alfred Hitchcock! Its a total shocker!"
1,The Hitch with Hitch,"Casting Will Smith's love interest in ""Hitch"" was not a simple black or white decision.Eva Mendes was given the role opposite Smith because the moviemakers were worried about the public's reaction if the part was given to a white or an African American actress.It was feared that a black couple would have put off worldwide audiences whereas a white/African American combo would have offended viewers in the U.S.Despite this, the movie offends Whites in other ways, by asserting stereotypes of Whites as fat nerds and Blacks as cool and sexy. Alongside the 'cool' Liberal - Clooney, Pitt, Gyllenhall, etc. - the pudgy, inadequate accountant played by Kevin James in the movie, is the default White character presented by Hollywood these days.For this reason I have no alternative but to regard this as much a racist film as Al Jolson 'blacking' up for a minstrel show in the ""Jazz Singer."""
2,Not funny,"All the funny scenes are in the preview, but this movies still has some cuteness that saves it. Not really a great romantic comedy, but it's mediocre. A fun way to waste 2 hours."
2,not KJ's fault - just bad writers,I rented this video because i'm a huge fan of Kevin James and was anxious to see if he is just as funny in this movie as he is in his hilarious King of Queens series. Not so. What a shame. The producers of Hitch should have hired the King of Queen writers; then they would have had a great comedy hit!
2,just ok,Will Smith always pretty much does the same role so not alot changes with Him on the Screen.Kevin James is kinda like the White Cedric The Entertainer in this film with His dancing&Antics. He is pretty much the bright spot of the film&that ain't saying much.the story line was cool.Eva Mendes is One Hot Mamma.but not much in terms of Acting.
3,An OK rental...,"I enjoyed this movie, but it went on for about a half-hour too long. All the stuff at the beginning was good: the conceit of Will Smith being a ""dating consultant"" who has the secrets of letting ""any"" guy get ""any"" girl he wants. What is good about the film are the performances from Will Smith and - surprisingly - Kevin James. Everyone can relate to that awkward feeling around someone you like, and how good it would be to have an expert coach you through it. It was also cute how Will Smith, as the expert, looses his cool around the girl he likes.Where the movie falls apart is when it gets into the standard cliches at the end. Of course, Will Smith will meet an ""evil"" guy who will misrepresent him, and his girlfriend will get the wrong idea. Couples will get together, break up, and magically reunite. This is an OK rental, but I'd be mad if I saw it in theaters. Not worth owning."
5,hitch,Great movie for a couple who are in love or experiencing problems in a relationship. Can help better the situation.
5,Awesome,Will Smith and his co-star are so funny in this film. It'll keep you laughing and at the same time it might remind you of time when you where trying to get someone's attention of the opposite sex. It's not bad on the romantic side of things either. Great movie.
4,Get Hitched!,"A ""date doctor"" helps a loser get the girl, but can't help himself get one. Kevin James steals the show in this one, if you like King of Queens check it out, he plays the same character with a different name.I thought all the ""deep advice"" on how to get a woman was kind of funny and over the top some of the time. I hope no young men out there buy this movie so they can learn how to pick up women. I can help them with that.To get a woman follow three steps:1) Buy a Ferrari2) Be seen in your Ferrari3) Enjoy all the women that you will spend time with.I give this movie 4 stars because it started a bit slow and was a bit too chick flick in spots. Plus, a bit of nudity would have helped."
3,fun and funny but sometimes boring,The talks are mostly boring and long.The action is silly and funny.Plot quite predictable.Soso for light watching but expect boring moments. DVD is perfect (can fast forward through the long talks!).
2,save your money and buy the dvd instead,"Either this was not filmed in HD, or it is a very poor transfer/encoding. Appears to be dvd quality, at best."
4,Excellent formula comedy,"I generally don't like formula movies. ""Hitch"" is a comedy based on a formula going back decades and decades - boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl. Yawn! But Will Smith is such a great actor that he's able to take a stale script and turn this movie into something quite enjoyable. Add to his performance a great comedic turn by Kevin James, and you've got one very predictable but very funny movie.Smith plays Hitch, A New York City matchmaker. Gauging from his lifestyle, he's a success. His latest client is a big, goofy guy [James], who's secretly in love with a beautiful heiress. Hitch grooms the guy in all the right moves. Meanwhile, Hitch meets a girl [Eva Mendes] who will turn his life upside down.The plot is absurd. It's the performances that make this movie work. Smith and James make it something both touching and loud out loud funny."
4,Hitch,"`Hitch' is an above average romantic comedy which has some genuinely funny laugh out loud moments and plenty of Will Smiths charm and humour. Smiths character, Hitch, is a dating consultant who, whilst easing the path of many geeky men in their own lovelives, has trouble wooing the lady he is interested in himself. This makes for many funny scenes where he coaches his clients to be suave and sophisticated on the one hand and then watching him royally mess things up on the other. The scene where Hitch has an allergic reaction to shellfish is especially funny and Smith carries it off with style. This isn't an amazing Hollywood blockbuster, or trying to be some deep meaningful art piece, it is a simple fun romantic comedy and as that is all it's trying to achieve, it carries it off well. Worth a look on a lazy Sunday afternoon or to rent on a quiet date night in.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
5,Hitch!,hitch is a great movie with a great storyline. if you love will smith you will love this movie!
2,It has its funny points,"I like Will Smith as an actor, but I'm not crazy about this movie. Ya it made me laugh a few times, but the rest of the time I was falling asleep."
4,Really cute!,"This movie is about a man named Alex ""Hitch"" Hitchens, Will Smith, who helps men with the women thay have fallen for. He is called the ""Date Doctor"". His newest client Albert, Kevin James, a clumbsy lawyer is in love with a beautiful, rich, famous woman named Allegra. Smitch tries to teach Kevin to be smooth, romantic, etc. Kevin James is so funny, and he and Will Smith have excellent chemistry on screen together. Eva Mendes also does a great job as Will Smith's love interest. I love anything with Will Smith and this one didnt dissappoint me. I loved this movie!!!"
5,Are They Crazy?,I just took the time to watch this film instead of wholesaleing it to a buyer. I've always liked Will Smith but the low ball price for this film was $1.28 and I make more selling it like that instead of individually at that price. Let me say this about that and this movie. Buy - Buy it you won't be disappointed. I laughed a lot and the connection Will Smith and Eva Mendes have is only exceeded by the chemistry that Albert Brennaman and Will have. If you think I'm wrong - E-Mail me and I'll buy it from you and give it to my friends at that price. By the way my copy's not for sale at any price.
2,Very Disappointing,"Wow. What a let down. After hearing so many people saying how much they thought this was funny and great, I looked forward to seeing this movie. I saw it last night and almost fell asleep. I think I laughed once throughout the whole movie. I love Kevin James and he's always funny in the King of Queens, but this wasn't the way he should have broken out into film. Will Smith was way too smooth and Amber Valeta should stick to modeling while she still has half her looks. Even if this was truely funny, all the funny parts have been shown on TV Trailers for so long, that the semi-good parts weren't new to me. I'm sorry to disagree with you all, - this was a big waste of time."
4,great entertainment,Found the movie light hearted and entertaining but with a message that is true in the real world. Will Smith plays this role well and the movie has just the right amount of humour without making it too corny. Romantics should enjoy this film.
4,GREAT MOVIE!!! LOVED IT~~~,"I just got done watching HITCH. I really enjoyed this movie. It was kind of cheesy at times, but overall it was really good. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a nice, light romantic comedy."
2,GO STRAIGHT TO THE END,"I cant really say this is a great flick because at the beginning when he meets the girl you know he will win her at the end. Everything is standard fare in this flick and it has some mild laughs but, it really fails to bowl you over. I cant say much else."
2,believable?,"this movie is absolutely nauseating. (1) are we really supposed to believe that this average looking man with profound acne knows THAT much about women? (2) are we supposed to believe that this average looking woman with an obtrusive mole on her face is THAT desireable? of course not. so, what is the point?"
4,Will Smith did it,"This movie was unrealistic in some parts (who buys someone something as expensive as scuba gear on a first date or lets a person come to THEIR house after they have an allergy attack) but other than that, the movie was unstoppable. It was hilarious, it was a realistic view at the dating scene (minus the above antics), and Will Smith carried this movie all the way through. I enjoy any movie he's in, to be honest with you. But I don't think the movie would've been good without him."
4,Just a fun movie...worth your $9,"I went to see this movie last Sunday, it was a dreary, nasty day outside and we decided to brave the elements and walk the 4 blocks to the theater. It was totally worth it. Will Smith is great, as is Kevin James and Eva Mendes. There were several other unknowns who did a great job. I love the ""rich heiress who has a heart"" - she was so not what you would expect from a Paris Hilton-type. I highly recommend this if you're looking for a light-hearted easy laugh. And yes...it is a good date movie!"
2,Praying for engine trouble!,"Saw this as an inflight movie. Boy, did I pray for engine trouble, so we'd have to land and I could get away! Sucks or what? I liked Smith in 'I, robot', 'Independence day', etc, but this was awful. It's a one-joke movie. Problem is, the one joke was the one plastered all over the TV spots and trailers (the jet ski incident). The highlights involved the subplot of him teaching a guy to be cool - wish that'd been the main storyline instead - far, far superior! Will not be adding this to my wishlist."
2,80% BORING!,"Come on Willard! (Wills real name) I look forward to your moviesDon't except anymore lame scripts like this one! Not quite asbad as Be Cool, but not a whole lot better. UNRECOMMENDED"
3,Unexpectedly Good Romantic Comedy,"Being a fan of both Wil Smith and Kevin James, I came into watching this one with a positive attitude, but was still pleasantly surprised at how (comparatively) good this thing was. I say comparatively as most contemporary comedies, from the almost unwatchably bad ""Meet the Fockers"" to the banal ""My Big Fat Greek Weeding"" could have been written (and probably were) by monkeys at a xerox machine. This one is a surprise, with a lot of good dialogue, mostly well-rounded characters and capable direction. The plot is pretty contrived, and the ending is predictable, but the laughs are there."
4,Kevin James is Hilarious!,"This is one hilarious movie. In it Will Smith is a date doctor that tries to hook up his clients with girls that they would by themselves have trouble getting either due to they are shy, not good with women or something else. Smith's character is trying to hook up Kevin James with a rich woman that he is in love with. It is a very funny movie in which Kevin James does a great job. The scene where he displays his dance moves is just HILARIOUS!!! Will Smith does a great job and has some very funny scenes too. All in all this is a very good comedy that I would definately recommend."
2,Movie could have been better!,"This movie could have been much better if it didn't all depend on Will Smith. If Kevin James was in more parts, this movie could be funnier and more entertaining. This movie had too much dialogue and that made it boring. I almost fell asleep 10 times. Do not see this movie."
5,Letting your guard down!,"Will Smith is brilliant in his comedic timing about how even the love expert can be a fool in love. Hitch meets Sarah (who is so scornful of romance she is like a doberman) and all his smooth talk goes awry. It's a typical ""meet your match"" that plays out in the gossip columns in New York. But when misunderstandings happen it's up to Hitch to let his own guard down to win Sarah back."
4,A Decent Comedy,"This movie was alright I expected more little bit, this is more of a chick flick, there some funny parts in this film which I laughed alot.Yes this is probably one of Will Smith's best performances but not his best movie.Overall:3.7.......Coulda Been Better"
3,"Not Bad, but Not Great either","Hitch brings to the screen the story of a consultant who helps guys on their dates. Things get a bit more complicated when he finds himself in need of help...It is not very unique, nevertheless, it is quite pleasant.The major setback is in relation to the choice for lead actress, which was poor at best; this film does not seem to be her thing, and she is not very likable. Overall, she is not convincing in her role.Aside from that, the setting and the plot are pretty good!In short, far from being a masterpiece, it is a movie worth watching as it will provide for an evening's entertainment, though you might not want to go as far as purchasing it. 3 Stars"
5,Great Movie,"I won't go into the details of the movie since other reviewers have already done so. I would just like to say this is a great clean commedy, with the exception of one curse word. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend that anyone looking for a great laugh, see it!"
4,A Movie Worthy of seeing,I really enjoyed this movie. Will Smith was great and there was plenty of laughter coming from the audience. I laughed throughout the entire movie. It's a must see movie for those who like comedies.
1,Hitcch,"Although I absolutely loved the movie, the quality left me disappointed. The audio and video was slightly off during the first part of the movie. It reminded me of the Japanese movies of the 60's where the actor's mouths did not match the audio portion. I did not return it because it wasn't worth the hassle of returning it."
3,"Fun, if predictable, romp through NYC dating","Charming as ever, Will Smith carries this film through many pitfalls to come out shining like a new penny (as usual). Supporting performances are more than disappointing, but Will Smith's squeaky-clean portrayal of a dating expert working to help men get to know women who would never give them a second glance intrigues and holds the viewer's interest through the entire film. The plot is one we've seen innumerable times before - man thinks he doesn't need woman, woman thinks the same, man and woman meet and begin to change their minds, woman finds out detail about man she doesn't like, man and woman break up, man and woman reunite after woman decides detail wasn't so bad after all. Still, Hitch ends leaving the viewer feeling amused and not too much stupider (see?) for having watched the movie."
4,I said I come ninety and you come....ALBERT!!!!,"I absolutely love this movie, I can really recommend it! Even if you are not a huge fan of Will Smith...go and see it, it's worth your money. It's about a man( Will Smith)who really got it going on, who has his act together so to speak. He is smart,sophisticated and not forget to mention good-looking ladies!! Albert on the contrary is a sad and lonely guy who needs help with the ladies...and I do mean desperate help. Who will be better at helping him than...need I say more...just go and see it, for all the ladies out there and men don't be afraid it's not one of those chick-movies, if you're feeling desperate yourself maybe you can get something out of it as well!!"
3,SAME OLD STORY,"This was kind of funny in certain parts but it's one of those old tales I keep seeing in Hollywood: boy and girl meet, boy has a secret, girl discovers it, there's a misunderstanding, they hate each other and then they love each other.Kind of cute but could we get some variety or is this all they think the masses want?There's a theme here about being yourself which has a lot of truth to it, but, there's also another theme about standing out in the beginning. Make your own decision."
4,Entertaining In Spots,"My feelings are good not great on this one. Will Smith tries to play the dating doctor but it turns out that he needs some thereapy when he falls for a reporter. Its all a matter of practicing what you preach. Some good scenes where Smith's, knowledgeable but shy accountant speaks out especially when confronted with aristocratic snobs. The speedating scene is amusing as well. Howver, the movie is sluggish in spots. Nonetheless the good outweighs the bad."
5,Giants,"Wow.I absolutely love this record.Two GIANTS of American music together. Not Sinatra singing along to pre-recorded tracks by a bunch of 2nd rate singers, as he did towards the end of his career, but two of the true legends of jazz singing classic tunes together while at the peak of their abilities.Ella Fitzgerald's voice is sheer perfection, Armstrong's horn is not the hot jazz of his earlier stuff, but still swings like nobody's business--and to hear Louis Armstrong sing is a thrill that I never tire of. The horn solo on ""Love Is Here To Stay,"" probably a throw-off for a master like Armstrong, swings and sways till you just want to scream.Everybody--and I mean, EVERYBODY--should have a copy of this LP."
2,"Why buy a ""best of"" when the originals are avaialble on CD","This best of Ella & Louis on Verve is pointless when you can perchase their two essental CD's ""Ella & Louis"" and ""Ella & Louis Again,"" and if you can't get enough buy their version of ""Porgy & Bess,"" this CD is just a compilation of the three mentioned from Verve. Start with Ella & Louis(Verve), but don't buy this pointless CD. The music on this sampler CD is absolutly wonderful, but why just get a sample, buy ""Ella & Louis"" or ""Ella & Louis Again"" instead of this."
5,Best Of Ella and Louie - Clearly Superior,The past will last. Clearly superior - Others can learn a lot from this CD - especially modern musicians. Just so everyone will know - There are many more like this one. The past will last. We don't know that we have the future but we know that we have the past. We have Ella and Louie. I suggest that all modern jazz musicians buy and pay very close attention to this and other similar recordings.
1,Regions ??????,We received the video just fine. It was purchased with school library funds. I've NEVER heard of REGIONS!! The video is COMPLETELY USELESS to us!!! Is there any recourse??
5,Must see!,"This is one of those movies, no matter what KIND of genre you like??...You have to see it, and will love it. great storyline, wonderful actors, buy it NOW! the book is great too."
5,"English teacher gives this DVD an ""A""","Don't know what more I can add to what so many other reviewers have mentioned. This is one of the best adaptations of a literary work ever made. All the students in my American Lit classes spoke very highly of the film after viewing, and if you are planning on teaching Steinbeck's novella, this is definitely the film version you want to show them. Excellent performances all the way around. A superior movie."
5,I great novel and movie!,I think the book was really good. shows how a friendship can bring to people so close together yet so far... but then can break it up just as easy. i think it's a dissling was to project the power of a friendship. END
5,gary sinse and john malkovich join together again!!!!,"when i watch this movie, i left crying. i couldnt imagine two more perfect actors to play the roles of george milton and lennie small( which his name carries a big irony, b/c he isnt small at all). it was a touching movie and perfect to watch together with good friends, but you must read the book first!!!john malkovich(lennie small) was adorable in the movie, and made it really funny. he is an excellent actor.and might i say, gary sinise(george milton) was completly buff and soooooo hot!!!especially with a pitchfork and an undershirt, he showed off his mucsles and u could see his abs!!!i guess it b/c of his rugged cowboy looks that make him real good to look at. Plus, he was only 32yrs old when he filmed it(this is not the only reason i watched the movie...)it's a really good movie and i recommend it everyone, but i must warn u, u will get sad in the end."
1,Of Mice and Men,I never got to see the movie due to my own ignorance. I had no idea that Region 2 was any different and I was unable to watch it. It was incompatible with my DVD player. I have the movie in my stuff to give to good will. I will purchase again in the future.
4,Slow Start Strong Finish,"The first act feels SO much like a play (especially the camping out scene), the beats and the acting are much different than the last two acts. Other than that weird discontinuity at the start it's a lovely film and Senise does a fantastic job directing and acting. Malkovich's Lenny leaves a bit to be desired at the start as well, but it grew on me and soon I found myself lost in the story. I recommend it because it does the book justice."
5,Excellent movie!,Great acting! My students watched this after reading the book and thought the movie was pretty true to the book. They really liked the movie!
5,Great movie.,"Gary Sinise has done it again. One of the best movies in the world. Best friends Lennie (Malkovich) and George (Sinise) are looking for work. They go to a ranch to work so they can go to their dream which is have 10 acres and have rabbits and stuff like that. Lennie really wants to tend the rabbits. He loves soft and furry things. Lennie gets George in trouble all the time. They go to work and everything works out find until the mentally retarted Lennie kills a girl, by breaking her neck. Now he has gone to far. You can't kill a girl and get away with it. So it forces George to make a decision of his own.Based on the book ""Of Mice and Men"" by John Stienback.Rated: PG-13 For Language and ViolenceRunning Time: 110 Minutes"
3,Of Mice and Men,"I have both the audio read by Gary Sinese and this film. I prefer the audio version. The film does not convey the power of the novel. Many English teacher like it, but I do not show it."
1,"This is Amazon's fault, not the seller!","Before ordering this I looked everywhere on Amazon to try to figure out what ""Region 2"" meant. I found no explanation so I ordered it. When I got it I could not play it because I obviously do not live in region 2--even though I still have no clue what that is! I know what the old NTSC and PAL formats are, and I suspect it is somehow related to that, but am unsure. Amazon's poor labeling of what this product is caused me to waste my time and money ordering it. I likely will trash it as I don't have time to repackage it and go to the post office to mail it back...."
3,Of Mice and Men book revfiew,"""Of Mice and Men"" is a novel that tells about two men and their experience working on a ranch. George is the smaller but smart one of the two. Lennie is the large one that suffers from mental retardation. Lennie is always getting into trouble but doesn't mean to. He always seems to mess things up for George. In the end Lennie does something really terrible that has only one solution for George."
5,Educator review of the movie Of Mice and Men on Amazon.com,"My 10th grade American Literature class read the book, and after each reading of a book I allow them to review the movie to compare/contrast it with the book. The students really enjoyed this movie. It related very closely to the novel. I purchased the movie instead of renting it because I plan to use it with future 10th graders, and I wanted it to always be a part of my video library. It is an excellent study of human relationships, and how we relate to and need each other. Since I used Amazon to view the movie, each day I did not have to remember where we stopped. After clicking the resume button, the movie would pick up at just the right place. Clarity was excellent, and it only took about a minute for the movie to load each day."
5,An emotional up lifting Story,This movie is one of the best movies I have had the pleasure of watching in years and I love the book. Gary Sinise does an exalent job making the film and keeping it as close to the book as possible which is something not many can and will do. This movie remindes me of me and my brother and how we were as younger kids. Its one of those movies that makes you appreciate your older or younger siblings no matter how much you may hate or love eachother. Anyone who has a heart and loves a good movie that will make you cry every once in a while this is it. I give it a 5 but Id give it a 10 if I could so dont pass this one up because its well worth it.
5,FANTASTIC MOVIE,JUST AN ALL AROUND GOOD MOVIE. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT IF YOU LIKE A MOVIE STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART. HAVE TO GIVE THIS ONE AN A+. SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED ACTING AWARDS
1,Zoverstocks,"Zoverstocks sent me a Dvd that is from ""region 2"" and therefore will not play in the U. S. It does say ""region 2"" on the order, but who would realize that means the product is useless? I did not view it in time for the warranty which is my fault, and Zoverstocks refuses to make good on the DVD."
3,of mice and men,"of mice and men is a great movie and book. its about two guys george and lenny how is locking for a jobb, but lenny is a retard he mess things up all the time.they want to earn money so they can buy a litle place.candy how is a old guy he will help them to buy the place.but lenny killed curlys wife and he ran away in to the wood, george find him first and killed lenny...i think that it was best that george killed him insted of curly because lenny dident now that george killed him, if curly had found him first he would now that he was going to be shoot.....this story about friendship"
1,of mice and men,"this dvd did not play in my region so im looking to return to sender and get a refund, wish me luck !!!"
1,of mice and men,"Of mice and menIn his interpretation of John Steinbeck's classic novel Of Mice and Men"" as a movie, Gary Sinise did a very good job. As heart - moving the novel is as difficult it is for a director to reflect its emotions on screen. However, Gary Sinise using an adaptation by Horton Foote has reached much more than that.The story is about two vagabonds or migrant workers travelling together, looking for work on ranches to earn enough money to make their dream of having their own piece of land come true. Two men who are completely different in appearance and character prove that real friendship is possible.George, played by Gary Sinise, is the intelligent part of the duo, who takes care about his strong but simple-minded friend Lennie, excellently played by John Malkovich.The director didn't change much of the novel and that's one reason why the movie is as good as it is and with its perfectly chosen actors it's really worth seeing."
5,Outstanding.,One of the rare breed of movies that really remains faithfull to the author and the original book. Outstanding.
1,Cursing!!,"I gave this DVD one star for the cursing! I was shocked to see that the book has a good amount of cursing which explained the cursing in the movie! The ONLY reason that I purchased this movie so my teen could understand the book better and I did not have to read the entire book. The acting was good! At the end of the movie, what happened to Lenny made me sick!"
1,A very bad language movie,"This movie states on the box that is is PG13 because of violence...It should state because of bad, bad language. It repeatedly used the name of God's Son, Jesus, my Savior, in a vain and bad way. Reguardless of what we paid for it, we tossed it in the garbage where it belongs. The movie plot got no where...taught no moral lessons ...encouraged no one. The retarded man was shot by his own friend in the end. Bad, Bad movie...don't buy it!"
1,Horrid,This was definately the worst story I have ever come across almost as bad as Johnny Tremain. Tolkien rocks read something worthwhile.
5,Movies based off books can be amazing,I had no expectations of this movie. I had not read the story. The movie was a big surprise to me. It was funny and very well made. The actors were greatly chosen. The actors definetely led the movie in a great way. This film is a must as it is needed to be experience through high school. Of Mice & Men proves that movies based off books can be very good even if its classis literature.
5,A real hidden gem,"Having been a big fan of the book, I was a little skeptical when I first rented this movie. I had never seen the original version with Lon Chaney and Burgess Meredith, but I did not see how such a short book could translate in to a full production movie and still hold true to the book. I was pleasantly surprised to see how well Gary Sinise told Steinback's classic tale, and how all of the characters were as believable as they were in the book. Perhaps the biggest surprise performance in this movie comes from Joe Morton, who plays the stable worker Crooks. The scene he shares with Malkovich's character Lenny when the other workers go to town is a subtle reminder of how everyone could use a friend from time to time, and it really hits on the friendship theme which is often ignored when this book is discussed. This movie is a must see for fans of the book, or for anyone who wants to see a movie which earns its stripes by its story and performances."
1,Wrong Items and Wrong Receipt!!,"I ordered 4 white frames to give family members wedding photos for Christmas. Not only did I receive the wrong items (3 black frames and 1 white frame), but I also received an incorrect receipt -- which states that I purchased The Exorcist Book, the Bible and a Peanuts Box Set. I am very disappointed in the lack of attention that was paid, and now need to go through the hassle of a return and replacing these holiday items."
4,Good Quality,"This is a good quality frame that I'm sure would have been more expensive at Target. It looks nice and it can hang on the wall, but doesn't have to."
2,looks cheap,definitely thought this item was going to appear higher quality and it ended up looking rather cheap. wouldnt order it again.
3,"Premier Custom Cut floor mats 2008 Acura TL - overall a decent item - a little pricey, one little issue","These mats fit pretty well. they are more expensive than generic mat sold at Target, but these may fit better. However some of the Universal Mats from Target look more deluxe. these mats look nice but seem a little basic and thin. also the back seat floor mats are shorter than the stock mats. the stock mats go quite a bit further under the front seats.I wish I had tried the universal mats from Target first and see how they fit. oh, well, no that I have 'em we'll see how they hold up.We have the pearl white TL with the light tan interior. the stock carpets are light tan too and get dirty too easy. there is some black on the upper door panel and dash, so these black floor mats work as it continues the two tone look to the floor."
3,Get It Right,"The title says Volume 2, but the cover is Volume 3, Track listing is for Volume 2 and part of a review pertains to Volume 3.Can you please sort out this inconsistency."
2,Surprisingly inadequate & inaccurate,"The book is laid out decently enough, with plenty of pretty full color pictures. It appears to be intended as merely an overview and/or basic review.The book attempts to provide a broad range of topics:1-History2-Botanical Facts3-Cultivation4-Techniques, Effects, and Customs5-The Connoisseur6-General informationHowever, each of these topics has very little depth. It will not provide any more insight into growing, use, or culture than what you could find on either of the two large online cannabis forums.There is much missing in this book, and many inaccuracies. Included recipes leave out how much to put in. Growing recommendations and expectations are patently wrong. The cultural history is incomplete. It's hard to believe that a former High Times editor put this together.This isn't a terrible book on cannabis, but there are so many better ones out there. Don't waste your time with this one."
5,Suspenseful and entertaining,"Children's books beg for the gifts of vivid imagination and delightful reading. Kathryn Lay's book, CROWN ME!, has both of these gifts and more. When immersed in the life of Justin, a 5th grade political hopeful, young readers will be entertained while inadvertently learning about attitudes, dealing with others, & politics. Ms. Lay's story, written in 1st person, is presented in a suspenseful and entertaining manner. I congratulate her on a great idea and wish I'd thought of it first."
5,Too funny,"I hate to say it, but I actually use this for my animation class to show my students what a good script and simple animation can do. The animation for ""here comes dr. tran"" is simple, clean, and really feeds to the script. Its a thing of beauty. The other Dr. Tran episodes are mostly spot on, with a few places that it felt like they were digging for time. ""Mr. Tran and the Toy Cack"" is probably more disturbing, and feels a bit off the ""dr. tran"" idea at first, but its so over the top that its a joy ride from start to finish (a joy ride with excessive blood!).Definately not for children. I would highly recommend this for the extras, the additional animations from lone sausage, and I hope they grace us with a vol 2 soon!"
4,Hilarious,"Dr. Tran: Number One American Icon is a collection of the first Lone Sausage cartoons. After having seen a few of them in Youtube, I loved them and had laughed. Ordering the DVD was no disappointment. I laughed, and nearly cried at Dr. Tran's Summer Splash, I giggled at Mr. Tran & Toy Cack, snickered at Roybertito's and vomited at Beyond Grandpa.5 Stars!!"
5,Music Redefined,"After hearing the debut album from Dom Dorman and the Icemen, it seems that there is something new and fresh on the horizon. I'm not sure I have heard something like this in quite a long time. I am fan of Dave Matthews and Blues Traveler and I truly believe that this album will attract the same fans. The sound is unique, in an interesting way blending jazz and classic rock. Dom Dorman is also quite versatile - playing both the quick and riveting Last November as well as the ballad-esque Southern Spain. I truly believe that this band has a future and I would recommend the album to anyone."
5,"This Book Is a Gem. Small, beautiful and precious!","This is a beautifully written book about a family of seemingly ordinary people who, each in their own way, proved to be great human beings.They were thrust into an incredible nightmare when their Karen Ann went into an irreversible coma.The family's only concerns were to do what they thought was right and what they knew Karen Ann would have wanted them to do. Their struggle to follow through on their beliefs and Karen's wishes changed the world.People are known by the company they keep. We are fortunate that this deeply personal book allows us to keep the company of Julia Quinlan.Thank you Julia, for this wonderful gift."
3,Pretty! But a b*** to put together!,"This is very lovely cabinet once it's put together. But it was definitely the biggest pain in the butt to put it together. The wood is very nice - hard and sturdy, but the pre drilled holes aren't drilled enough so I stripped all of the screws trying to screw them in - even though I redrilled the predrilled holes! Also, you're supposed to put the hinges on opposite what the directions say - so that's a bit confusing.The cubbies don't fit a shoes larger than a women's size 7 and high heels bigger than 3"".When the cabinet is put together, it's beautiful. But the magnet doesn't really keep the door closed if the screws on the hinges aren't drilled perfectly so the top is flush with the top of the hinge (mine aren't :p ) ...so you might need to get a stronger magnet."
1,Shoe Slot is too small!,"I purchased this and also the 33"" shoe cabinet. I took me about 1 hour to put this together. Not too bad except for the fact that the magnet for door attachment was drilled in the wrong slot, and the screw for the door knob is too short. My biggest disappointment is that the shoe slots were way too small. I can barely fit my daughter size 3 tennis shoe in the slot. I have to remove one of the divider and even then, the slots were too small for a size 6 tennis shoes. Pretty bad design, and not very useful. I won't even waste my time putting together the 33"" cabinet."
4,"5-star selection, but too short!","Billie Holiday is an amazing singer. That's the easy part. The difficult part is sorting through the unceasing number of compilations, reissues, and box sets in her name, the majority of which bear titles with words like best, greats, essential, or quintessential! I can't tell you definitively (another word that pops up) whether this is indeed the *ultimate* Billie Holiday, but it was a surprisingly good find in my opinion. I have heard several Holiday collections and albums, and this is a nice addition. I think it would be a fair place to begin, as well. The picks are great, but Holiday could make ""Baby One More Time"" transfixing and deep. The live inclusions are a bonus, and it's nice to see a disc that doesn't favour her ""love"" songs over masterpieces like ""Strange Fruit.""Maybe you should look at the title another way: Billie Holiday was the ultimate. Go ahead and get something by her, maybe this one, and begin appreciating her extraordinary talents."
5,Excellent introduction to ASP.NET with VB.NET,"I agree with those who put 5 stars for this book. If you haven't had previous experience with ASP.NET, this is the way to go. Just excellent. Together with Professional ASP.NET will be sufficient to get you started with ASP.NET and VB.NET."
4,Excelent work by Manitoba/Caribou,"There is no doubt that Manitoba/Caribou is one of the most virtuous indie-electronic musicians in North America. This is a good sample of his work, combining and manipulating nice melodies and sounds together with excellent percussions."
2,it will get the job done.,"Grass doesn't exactly run from this size line. I go with a braided line same diameter much stronger. You get more for less on the braided because it lasts a lot longer. this line I find breaks often and I have to replace it constantly. That can be time consuming and frustrating. This does come at a great bargain though, and if you are a homeowner just needing to get the job done, it will certainly do that. I no longer use it for my business though."
3,Good Cable,"I bought this hoping it would work with a legacy camcorder I got to run on an aging laptop. Unfortunately, it didn't work for my purposes but not due to the product itself. This was probably due to (lousy) Windows Vista updates that have rendered my laptop incompatible with certain Panasonic products. The cable appears to be well made and work properly. I'm sure most would be pleased with this product. It arrived quickly and was competively priced."
4,"Works good, but if real cold out, the lights are not as bright",Had one for 4 years until one light of the two burned out. I just got another one. Even came with velcro sticks. Nice.
4,Not too bad,If you have an older car and you just want to help discourage would be thieves this would seem to help. The only con that I can see is that it is large and if you don't have tinted windows and the thief has a flashlight he will probably figure out what the unit is. I have tinted windows and all you can see is the lights flashing not the unit. For the price not too bad.
1,Not good,"Cheap constructed, not really believable and the holder loses its stickiness quickly so you either super glue it or it will fall again.I only liked the fact that you can replace the batteries and I use the reusable ones. But after it fell the last time, I got sick of it and don't even use it anymore. Don't waste your money."
1,Nothing like the real thing,"The device has 2 LEDs and the blinking alternates between those two lights .The frequency of the blinking is too fast and normally a anti-theft device has only one LED. It looks absolutely nothing like a real anti-theft device. I got it and I felt this would probably attract thieves (it's like a freaking open invitation for thieves saying ""come! I don't have an alarm system installed!"") . I decided not to use it. Also, it's over-priced for a simple led circuit. I will not recommend anyone to get this if you truly care about your car."
4,Great deal for the price...,"This looks like the real thing ~ flashing red lights in the front of my truck cab. Great deal for the price. My only complaint is that the sticky glue on the back doesn't stick to the dash or anywhere else. Just falls off. I put it in the ashtray ( I don't smoke ), where it's secure and visible. This item along with the decals and a steering wheel lock will keep out the amateurs...and doubtful a pro would want my truck. Glad I found it. Fast shipping with Amazon Prime."
4,A preventive approach,"Item worked as advertised, does give the appearance of a real working alarm system. In the world of crime prevention any approach is better than none."
2,Adhesive not strong enough for led light,"The stickers are fine and probably have some deterrent value, although they could be more imaginative as a ""fake alarm"" sticket. The leg light keeps falling off as the heat in the car causes the adhesive to melt. It keeps ending up on the floor."
1,Crap,Don't waste your money. The way the two LEDs blink make this thing look like what it is... a toy. Very disappointed. Can't believe I spent more than 1 dollar on such a crappy thing. Even a kid would understand that this thing is not an alarm.
2,Eh....,"The main pro of this product is that it looks real enough. I wouldn't place it directly in view for a would-be robber to see because the person could tell it's not connected to the car's electrical system in any way (and is therefore fake). Thankfully my radio has been stolen already so I was able to place it inside where the hole is, just showing, and it looks like it could be attached to something.The con is the thing is garbage. Yes it is cheaply made, it's just alternates flashing lights. The battery life on this thing is ridiculous. Lasts about 3-4 days, roughly 8-10 hours per day on 2 AAA batteries. Not exactly what I was looking for. Oh well."
5,"Effective, Realistic Bluff","At night, this phoney alarm looks very convincing. When you mount it, rest it on a ledge since the velcro that comes with it is not very strong. I ve had it for a month and the batteries are still working. The shipping was as much as the product but this can not be had in your typical auto parts store. Probably because they would not sell the real thing that costs $200 more."
3,on/off switch on the side,I was disappointed that it had a big on/off switch on the side of the box so how will this deter a thief with a flashlight. If anything it tells the thief you don't have a car alarm or why else would you have a fake alarm light. They should have designed it so that the switch is on the back with the velcro.
2,"Geli Raubal -- A ""Mystery"" of WWII ?","There is yet another anomaly in this substandard DVD series on WWII. It has a section concerning the unsolved murder of Geli Raubal, Hitler's niece -- widely suspected to have been carried out by Hitler himself, but still not confirmed to be so. What is so mysterious about this? Weren't there innumerable others whom Hitler has secretly murdered? Also, this was not a ""mystery of WWII"", but an event related to Hitler's inner circle well before (8 years prior to) WWII. Can one be any other wiser, about the strange and lamentable ""productions"" that are made today, in the name of furthering history?"
5,Funny movie,This is an old classic comedy I love watching. Everytime it makes me laugh. Its supposed to be funny and not serious. Well worth watching this movie if you love Paul Hogan in the early 90's flicks. Just a great laugh.
3,Lightning Jack,"I was expecting nothing less than fantastic from Paul Hogan. Crocodile Dundee 1 & 2, were great movies. Wasn't as great as I expected. Was good, but not great."
4,Paul Hogan & Cuba Gooding! WOW !!,"I had the first two (2) Crocodile Dundee adventures, then Almost an Angel,this to me was #1....."
5,amazing movie and amazing service,"the movie was excellent, a timeless classic. also, the service amazon had in getting the movie was just astounding i couldnt have got any better service any where else."
5,intriguingly amusing,"Paul Hogan,and Cuba Gooding jnr. a fabulous duo, it is a movie well worth watching more than once,it is very entertaining,the type of movie where you don't want to leave your seat until it is over, buy it you will be pleased you did.i don't want to give the story away,it would be ruined then.it is a brilliant western mixed with loads of comedy and touching moments."
5,grate movies,i saw movies before on vhs an wanted it on dvd very good movies it funny an thay need to make more good movies like this one
5,Lightening Jack DVD,The DVD plays beautifully and came in a timely manner with no hassles. Just the way I like it! Thank you!
2,Pretty but flimsy,Lost its shape so quickly. I took it on vacation and had to stash it in my luggage and it lost it's shape now the brim is loose and flimsy. I still like he material and it looks pretty but have to maneuver it to get it to sit right on my head.
1,Disapoitned,"The director's cut is exactly that, it cut some of the dialogue and the Clannad musical score. The movie it self is great just not this version.I have both versions on DVD. I watch the Theatrical version. To much has been cut out of the Directors Cut.The only good addition to the Directors Cut version is the closeing speech. It's worth getting a region free DVD player or DVD X Player for your computer so you can watch this and other movies you cann't get here in the U.S.. I shop Amazon.co.uk to find movies you cann't get here."
2,Stay away from directors cut.,I say so because it doesn't have the original cut as well. So until the first versions out. I won't get the directors cut too.
2,Doesn't deliver emotionally,"Ok, I just watched this film last night. After browsing amazon.com for good reviews on a classic adventure movie like BRAVEHEART, I came across LAST OF THE MOHICANS. I dowloaded a few songs from the soundtrack and fell in love with the music. Naturally, I had to see the movie.I'll get to the point...THE MUSIC AND SCENERY WAS AWESOME. I thought the acting was NOT up to par, I thought the love story was completely underdeveloped and I thought the script was horrible. I was completely lost the first 45 minutes and so was my mother, who teaches Cooper's novel. BUT...I have to say, the ending scene was beautifully done--visually.Anyway, go buy the soundtrack--that's where the real magic of this movie is.Anyone agree with me on this...because I see many great reviews for the film on here...honestly, I thought it was semi-cruddy."
3,Original Version = 5 stars / THIS Version = 3,"I was very disappointed that this version of the film has cut critical scenes from the original that were intended to help develop the romantic courtship between Hawkeye and Cora. If I had known that this was the case, I would have NEVER sold my VHS version to buy the DVD!Although it is good movie overall, I would choose the original version all day long over this one. If you have any desire to see this movie as it was originally shown, do yourself a favor and buy the VHS version."
3,Got it cheap so its ok,Blu-ray disk with the super sharp picture showing us the faults of the original film it was printed on. My wife likes it so thank god we got this cheap!!!
1,DVD didn't work On anything I had.,The DVD would not play in anything I had. I have 4 DVD players and recorders and 3 Lap Top Computers and It wouldn't play on any of them. The folks did get me my money back when I returned it but they should know by now if the dvd is playingfor people or not. I give the one star for the DVD not the service. They did right by me so I give them a 5 stars for that.
1,poor transfer,"yet another crappy blu-ray transfer. really, don't waste your money the dvd looks and sounds better than this."
1,Terrible Quality Picture!!!!,"I downloaded an old movie of John Candy and accepted the low quality because it was an older movie. However, I selected the HD version of Last of the Mohicans and got another crappy movie. The sound was junky and you only got a TV version (not wide screen and not even close to HD) and you could actually see they videoed off of a movie screen, you could see the fabrick lines of the movie screen. I have been using Amazon for lot of purchases and music downloads. Happy with all. But I will never ever download another movie from Amazon again!!!!"
5,The Last of the Mohicans (Director's Expanded Edition),"Love this movie!!! Director took liberties with the story but WHO CARES? Did YOU ever read the book?? Both Daniel Lewis and Madeline Stowe look and act brilliantly. Music is stunning, cinematography breathtaking. Direction is crisp and visceral. I just love this movie!!!"
3,Soap-opera in pre-revolutionary America,Hollywood-ized adaption of James Fennimore Cooper's classic novel. Great scenery and action but soap opera story and sappy romance give this the feel of one of those 70/80s TV miniseries.
2,Great movie Bad Blu-ray transfer,"This is an amazing movie but one of the worst ""upgrades"" I've seen in a while. I already owned the DVD. Now I might as well own 2. It in no way seems like you are watching a Blu-ray movie. I understand there is only so much they can do, but if they can't do any better than that they might as well not release it on Blu-ray."
2,Very disappointing,"This was among the top ten favorite movies and at the top of my DVD wish list. Upon receiving the DVD, I popped it into the DVD player. At first, while viewing this wonderful movie, I thought there was a glitch in the DVD since one of the very best parts was missing and part of the sound track was gone...a very beautiful and haunting song as the captives are marched away, pursued by their rescuers. I finally figured out that the whole scene was gone, making the scenario very choppy and frankly, it ruined the rest of the movie. I am VERY SORRY I ever ordered this movie on DVD. I want my VHS copy back!!! Since I gave it away, and not being an Indian giver (no pun intended), I am absolutelyn furious. I advise anyone who is a fan of the original movie...DON'T waste your money on this poor example of a movie!!!"
5,Movie Review,Very good movie and great acting. Very good to be able to watch a family movie and not having to worry about censorship.
3,Director's Cut not the Best Cut,"This DVD is a major disappointment. Mann has produced an expanded edit which loses much of the pace and rhythm of the original theatre presentation. Worse, there are several deletions, including the loss of Clannad's ""I Will Find You."" Hawkeye's ""Someday you and I are going to have a serious disagreement"" comment to Duncan, on the river after the thrilling ambush, has disappeared. Hawkeye's sarcastic wit, not present in the Leather Stocking books, was a real winner in the movie. Why then remove it. Earlier adverts for the DVD mentioned ""Director's commentary."" It is a real pity this did not materialise. I would like to have heard more of the building and eventual burial of the fort. Perhaps best to wait for Collectors edition."
2,Great Orginal Movie Degraded with Choppy Edits & Bad DVD,"For those who love this movie and are expecting a great DVD, save your money, because you'll be extremely disappointed with the quality of the DVD transfer and the new choppy edits. The new less-than-seamless edits, poor color and lighting, and muddy dialogue transfer are more than enough reasons not to spend your money on this version. I agree with the others who hope this is not the last definitive version of this movie."
2,Poor Picture Quality,"It's too bad I waited so long to see this BD version after purchasing it from Amazon. It's way too dark, even when viewing at night with all the lights off. I gave my previous DVD version of this movie away once the BD version arrived. I wish I could get it back. Even the dark scenes on the DVD version had more detail than this crummy BluRay rip-off. I know now that when you first open up the BD case and find only the disk, be alert to a mediocre effort in providing a good quality BD product. What a waste of time and money."
3,"Great VHS, Horrible DVD","When you read these reviews, make sure you're reading the reviews for the DVD, which is very poor, and not the reviews for the VHS, which is superb. Like many people, I couldn't wait for the DVD of this wonderful movie, but no DVD has ever disappointed me as much as this one. I accept the fact that Mann may have had a different vision for this movie than the commercial version, but it is an inferior version (with which we can simply agree to disagree) but it is also poorly produced technically and that is inexcusable. The DVD should have at least included both Mann's version and the original commercial version. Perhaps one day, someone will wake up and the original version of this movie will be available on DVD, but it isn't at present."
2,Disappointing DVD (Director's Cut),"Great picture quality and sound, terrible editing. They edited out the intensity the original film in theaters and VHS gave to the plot. The battle scenes that were added made the film boring. The soundtrack that was edited away took away from the intensity of the love between Nathaniel and Cora. I went searching for the VHS version and bought that version. Fortunately, I didn't get rid of my video player when DVD technology came out. I definately would NOT recommend the DVD unless they release a version of the original film that was released to theaters or at least a DVD version that is identical to the VHS."
2,It had it's moments,"If you are expecting a film that is true to the novel, FORGET IT.If you want a film that is historically accurate, FORGET IT.But, if you just want an 18th Century (Okay, pseudo 18th Century) action flick, go for it. We've come a long way since the Randolph Scott version (and the silent one with Bela Lugosi as an Indian) but this could have been SOOOOO Much BETTER. The unrealistic dialog of the novel was dropped (THANK YOU) but some of the fighting sequences looked like the belonged in a Jackie Chan movie. The musical score was fantastic, (especially the opening music) the seige and massacre sequences were quite good, but it ends there. Even though reenactors provided invaluable assistance and knowledge, Mann didn't use it enough. The real saving grace for this one was Wes Studi as Magua. He didn't play the part like a cartoon character. You actually felt sympathy for his character in places.(It makes me detest the British even moreso)"
3,A Bit on the Dark Side,"Probably one of the darkest transfers I've seen, with detail lost in some scenes. Still, not bad by any means and the increased resolution of Blu-ray is most welcome."
5,THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS,THIS IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL. WONDERFUL SCENERY AND GREAT ACTING.THE MUSIC IS ENCHANTING TOO. VERY REALISTIC VIEW OF THE PERIOD.
2,A great movie spoiled.,Disappointing editing choices make this version of the film weaker then the original theatrical release. Certain powerful momemts from the film are now just plain missing.
4,Good movie,"Much, much, much better than the book. The only time in Hollywood history has a movie been made that's better than the book. That's all I can say."
5,A Classic Film of A Classic Novel,"With acting that is superb by Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeleine Stowe the history of the French and Indian war comes to life. There is foreshadowing of the American Revolution to come. As a boy I read this great adventure novel, but was in awe at the way it was brought to life! One film that you can go back to time and again..."
1,Original is Better,"The Last of the Mohicans is my all-time favorite movie--that is in the original format. The DVD sold in the US is the Director's Cut and leaves me with disgust and outrage. The war at the fort is now way too long and my most favorite moments have now been deleted and replaced with counterfeit moments. The music does not even seem to flow the same way. I went to Wal-Mart the other day and found a DVD just entitled The Last of the Mohicans, but don't be fooled. Notice carefully that whoever packaged it is obviously feeling the heat of those like me that feel the same way. They carefully place a paper over the what is truly the original. It is the worse-than-awful Director's Cut. If you want the best edition, buy the VHS version if you can find it or the version from Great Britain which is owned by Warner Brothers not Fox. Even with the lesser quality of the VHS over a DVD, you still will walk away with a far better deal."
3,Shame on you Michael Mann,"I wish so much, that i had read Eric Batesons review before i bought this film. I too am a great fan of the film, the VHS edition that is, but after having watched the directors cut I am a bit disapointed in Michael Mann. He has cut out two of the coolest lines in the film, and removed ""Clannad - I Will Find you"" from the soundtrack. The image and sound quality is of course topnotch, but that just doesn't justify destroying such a good film, by doing the lousyest directors cut I have ever seen."
1,Classic got ripped - Blu-Ray version,"So much for Director's Expanded edition. It's shameful how some people would do anything for money.I triple-dipped on this one, VHS, DVD and then this piece of Blu-ray trash. It was dark and the color is off (greenish). It might be just a tad sharper than the DVD, but for 1080p, I expect nothing less than perfection, especially viewing on a 100"" plus screen. BTW, the disc itself is NOT defective, others have similar experience.The only reason it got 1 star was the movie content itself, a classic ripped from 480p to 1080p.Do not buy; just get the DVD version if you do not have one yet."
2,Agreeing with Book Lover...,"I am going to go with the previous review made by ""Book Lover"" on this one. We watched this movie in my English class Thursday, Monday, and today, and I was very disappointed with it because I'd previously read the book. However, since I was the only one to have done so, the discussion when the movie was finished today was biased towards the film. Even my teacher admitted to not having read the book, and so I was alone in my stand. But apart from myself...there were severe contrasts between the book and the movie, enough to drive the literature lover insane. Granted, the historical aspects of the film -- costumes, scenery, buildings/locations, etc. -- were very accurate, and the performances by the actors were excellent, and the soundtrack was beautiful...but refer to Book Lover's review, and you'll see what I mean. It's not a bad movie. It just has some major, major flaws. James Fennimore Cooper deserved better."
1,This item is not a Blu-Ray quality product,This item is another example of transferring dvd content directly to a blu-ray disk and then marketing it as being of blu-ray high definition quality--- IT IS NOT. The image quality is less than the image quality of Last of the Mohicans on a dvd played on a up-conversion dvd player. The color is so poor(low chroma) that it appears to have actually been copied from an old VHS master where much of the data has vanished over time. The quality of this item is pathetic when compared to any real blu-ray mastered item. I am really offended to be scamed like this again!
2,directors version ruined movie,"I agree with so many that the director ruined this beautiful movie when he put it on DVD. I will be digging out my VHS version. The original VHS had a wonderful flow with powerful music like ""I will Find you"" by Clannad that was cut from the DVD to my disappointment. The DVD scenes are choppy and rushed so that the intensity and emotion of the movie cannot build and by cutting some of the most romantic music of the soundtrack, the movie was further diminished. Soooo sad."
3,"Great script version, poor Blu-ray transfer","I have seen this in the theater, on an extended DVD and now on the director's definitive cut. I really like this version in terms of script but I was disappointed with the Blu-ray transfer. For example, when Magua was talking to Montcalm at night, the back of Magua's head was a dark hole in the screen without detail. I remember the DVD as being a brighter transfer.This is a must buy if you do not own a satisfactory version but the transfer does no credit to the great cinematography of Dante Spinotti."
1,"Theatrical Edition got its heart cut out (Oustanding movie, crap DVD)","This is a truly great movie that's been scalped and hacked by Mann and his personal vision. Plain dumb that Mann didn't release the original theatrical version and his director's cut version on 2 DVDs in the same packaging. Or even as separate releases.When you gonna release the original on DVD, Mann?! It's 2010 already!"
1,WHEN WILL THIS MADNESS END ?,When will Michael Mann grant us the original version we saw in the theaters on DVD ?
4,"Doesn't follow book,but still good movie","After reading the book,it became my favorite.So I was disappointed that the movie did not follow the book very much.About half the book was missing from the movie and the relationship between Hawkeye and Cora is all Hollywood.In the book,Cora and Uncas die.Not Alice,Uncas,and Heyward.And I was so heartbroken by the portrayal of Heyward as a cold,heartless military man who meets his demise at the stake.That is not how he was in the book at all!I do give the movie makers credit,however for the stellar score and realistic storytelling.It was not a bad movie,it was just disappointing if you're expecting the same story as the book."
3,audio problems,"I really wanted this Blu-ray for the DTS sound, but it came up mute. There was normal audio on the commentary track, the menu, and the supplements, but, the moment I hit Play, all sound disappeared (I have a DTS amp, obviously, but neither the Dolby nor DTS setting would work). It was still gone when I stopped the disc and then resumed. I finally discovered, by accident, that if I started the movie, changed the input on my amp (an Onkyo) to something else, and then returned to the film, that sound appeared. However, it was of very low volume compared to any DTS disc I've ever heard. I don't know if this is a mismatch between equipment, or an authoring error, but I'm going with the latter (no other Blu-ray disc has ever done this).BTW, I also thought the film looked unusually dark, even in the daylight scenes, although the images were crisp. I think I'll look for a region 2 Blu-ray."
2,dissapointing DVD version,"I give it a two stars instead of just 1 because the movie itself is enjoyable. However, it seriously misses on the original dialogue (.ie. there is original dialogue missing during the argument between Duncan and Hawkeye inside the forth.)Also, the original movie had beautiful music that is missing in the DVD version (.ie. Clanad's ""I will find you"" musical background is missing in the scene where the heroes climb the mountains following Magua's war party and the Munro's daugthers.)It felt like a cheeseburger without the cheese and with fried tofu for meat. I strongly recommend the movie itself, but I don't recommend this particular DVD version of it."
