2,Not as good as belly flops,"I bought 10 lbs of belly flops a while back and those were so good and very sweet. These jelly beans or not as sweet nor tasty. There seems to be a lot more root beer beans than any other ones. They did not come in bags just a box of jelly beans. The value was very good for the money, but in the future I'm only going to stick to flops."
1,No Vitamin D3!,"Folks, if you don't glean anything else from this review, know this: Vitamin D3 is Cholecalciferol. This multi contains NO VITAMIN D3. Vitamin D3 is the beneficial Vitamin D in which many people are critically deficient.The Ergocalciferol contained in this product is not Vitamin D3. Ergocalciferol is something your body has to deal with, it's overhead and not shown to provide the benefits of Vitamin D3 supplementation. If you're interested in the rest of the story, you may want to visit the Vitamin D Council's web site and/or Dr. Mercola's web site.Your kids may like the taste of these (as mine did), but it isn't worth it. Find somethings else."
5,Grea product,My kids love the fruity tast. They look forward to getting their vitamins each morning!
1,High Lead Level,"I typically don't pay attention to reviews that list problems without a source. But in seeing the past review regarding high lead levels I did some research and the FDA does have this product listed as having one of the higher lead levels for children's vitamins from a study done 8/08.Here is the FDA link:[...] (OK, my link was edited out, look in comments of the post below or search the FDA website.)I found no rebuttal or mention of this on the Nature's Plus website, so I will no longer use this product.The FDA does list the lead level within acceptable limits. My thought on that is:1. Why is there ANY lead in children's vitamins!2. There is NO safe level of lead to consume. Again do your own research on this."
5,Great kid's healthy mutli-vitamin,"Love this vitamin for my preschooler! No dyes, no preservaties! We give her 2 every morning helps to balance out her meals when she does not eat all her veggies!"
2,Not tasty,"My kids are generally not too fussy about medicines. I have a 3 yr and a 1 yr and both refused to eat it after couple of days. When I tasted it, I felt a powdery muddy taste on my tougue inspite of great orange, cherry, grapes flavors. I am going to go back to my Nordic treats. They are the best."
5,We love these!,These are the best tasting vitamins I have tasted. My son loves them and begs for them everyday. I have to admit I sometimes sneak a few for myself. Yum yum.
2,Good for the kids but......,"I was very excited about these vitamins due to all the nutrients packed in them. However, my kids have been eating exclusively gummy vitamins their whole life and just refused to eat these. They made me try one and I had to concur, they are pretty grainy, chalky and sour. If your kid isn't picky and hasn't developed a taste for gummy vitamins then give it a shot. But, I'm stuck with a big ole' jar of these because my kids just won't do it!"
5,Great Multi,Got this for my kids and they love it! This product is way better than the sticky gummy in terms of the taste and smell.
1,Cheap piece o' crapp,"I needed something to get my order to $25 to get my Super Saver shipping, so I got this for my son. It really sucks! No on/off switch, and it rattles when it runs, and the pieces are hard to move/use. The music is loud and annoying."
3,Not that interested,I really like the pony but my 11 month old doesnt have much interest in it she will show she wants to be but on it occasionally and then bounce around for a minute or two and want off. Possibly she will like it more when she can get off and on by herself.It seems to be pretty well made and should last quite awhile I just hope she takes more interest.
4,It's growing on her...,"I bought this pony for my eight-month old who's already cruising around on the furniture. I figured this would help expend some of that boundless energy and save us a couple of heart attacks with her attempted climbing exploits.So far she likes to enjoy the challenge of climbing on the head of the pony then actually ride the thing. She does bounce on it quite a bit, but then those pointy ears get her attention and then its the mane and then, ""oh what's this, pony has a squishy nose I can chew on.."", and pretty soon grabbing her before another trapeze act can be performed.And yes, there is a safety seat, but she is in the 97% for height and her little thighs get pinched,(squished) when she puts her feet on the stirrups, so we had to take it off. Otherwise it would have held the little climber just fine. I think she will enjoy it more as she gets older and her attention span grows."
4,Very Cute!,This toy is awesomely cute. Easy set up and easy to clean. I passed it on to my younger nephews when my son was done with it and it lasted through 3 boys.
2,radio flyer rock and bounce horse,"It was easy to put together even for a grandmother (me) the night before Christmas. Very lightweight. But eventho my grandson is not overweight but tall for a barely 1 year old the seat was too small. And because he is just one he is not capable of safely holding on to ride or get on by himself yet. So I would say to future purchasers, there may be a time after he outgrows the safety seat to put the toy aside until your child can climb on and rock by himself."
4,fun for the little ones,"My 15-month old daughter loved this horse at first. she sat on it for hours Christmas morning. since then she's more interested in riding her sister's big horse than this little one. If I had to re-do my purchase, I would have gotten her a full size horse with a baby seat attachment (if they make one..) This horse is very well made and was very easy to put together."
3,maybe for older kids?,"my 10 month old wont stay in it for more than a few minutes. we hoped we could put him in it so we could steal a few minutes to do stuff around the house while he entertained himself. my hunch is that he will like it more in a few months time, but not at the moment.feels safe and fun looking. fairly easy to build. maybe a little expensive for what it is."
3,made in china,"one of my 2 year old twin boys likes this toy a good bit, but the other doesn't pay it any attention. He is a bit stockier, so I don't think he likes the idea of the extra effort to get on it? They both loved it when they were smaller & we used the safety seat. Sometimes the smaller just jumps like a wild man, but really alot of $ for no more than what they play with it. It is made in China *ugh* which is a negative for me, but a positive is the horse cover is machine washable & that is nice. The toy is durable, but does tend to scoot while child is riding."
5,Great toy,Bought as gift for Grandson. Took care of all his energy. Is pretty durable as an action toy. Wish it had a Blue base.
4,"Cute rocking horse, good value, safe, doesn't rock that well","This horse bounces great, but doesn't rock back & forth very much.... it more scoots across the floor on it's slick plastic base. However it is nice & low to the ground, and so far we have had no safety concerns. We've never used the removeable plastic seat back, as our little one didn't need it - we got it for her at 16 months, and she could use it right away."
5,Ride em cowboy!,"My 9 month old son had outgrown his Jumperoo so I bought this for him. He tried out the floor model at the store and just loved it! His face lit up at once! I loved the fact that this had a seat to hold him in to prevent him from getting hurt. He spent hours in this thing, bouncing and rocking. However, he is now 17 months old. I removed the seat about 2 months ago because he was too big for it. He hasn't used it since. My 5 year old daughter loves it though! She sits on it to watch cartoons. Anyhow, I would recommend this toy to anyone looking for a great safe toy to put your child in!"
3,A nice pony but not the end-all be-all of rides,"This toy is a lot bigger than I expected. If space is an issue for you, you should get the Fisher-Price Bounce 'n' Spin Zebra. Also, just a warning, when you take the parts out of the box, the rubber bands smell! I did not enjoy this aspect of the toy and had to air it out the odor was so strong.As far as entertainment value goes, I'm not terribly impressed yet, as my toddler likes the pony all right but not so much as to sit on it and ride for more than five minutes. The pony doesn't rock as well as it should, and it slides all over carpet. Be warned. It doesn't make any sounds either. To get the model with sounds be prepared to fork out $100 whereas the Bounce 'n' Spin Zebra we have was comparably priced and has music and sounds!I don't know which one will win out in the end, but this Radio Flyer pony could use a few tweaks in the rock feature."
4,tickled to pieces,"I bought this toy for my grandson's first birthday, and as soon as his mom put it together he was climbing on it, during his birthday party he kept going back to his pony, he just loved it, it is was the hit of the party.and I am tickled to pieces to have been the one to give it to him.I babysit my grandson while his parents both work same shift, and everyday he is wanting me to let him ride his pony. It was worth every cent, getting it for him."
3,It's a cute rocking horse,We got this for my son's 1 year old birthday. I don't know if he's just not sure what to do yet but he just kinda sits there. He rubs the horse's head and bounces a touch but that's it. He loved his jumperoo so I thought this would be a hit but maybe its a bit too early.
5,Perfect Present,I bought this for my 15 month old grandaughter for christmas. She is loving it. She is very energetic and this gives her something to play on in the house to burn off some of that energy. I was especially pleased with the price ( $[...] less than a toy store ) and it came very quickly. Couldn't be happier.
4,Radio Flyer Pony,I purchased this pony for a one-year-old and she does like to bounce when we set her on the pony. She may enjoy it more when she is able to get on and off by herself. The pony was easy to put together and appears well-made. It takes more space than I realized--a little on the bulky side.
5,giddy app,"this is absolutely the greatest pony. it's great exercise, both with rocking and bouncing, excellent for coordination. very safe. my 9 month old grandson loves this as well as my neighbors 3 year old. the fact that it grows with the child is a major plus and also the pony being plush it comfy and safe. couldn't ask for more in a toy. i plan to get a second one for easter for my now 3 month old grandson who will be at the perfect age at easter."
5,Terrific New Radio Flyer Product,"My littlest granddaughter loved this new pony. She's 5 months old and still needs a helping hand, but as soon as she was seated she grinned and giggled in delight. I know she'll have lots of fun on this carefully made (& well padded) miniature version of the classic pony.We love Radio Flyer products!"
2,Not a hit,We bought this for my huge infant because he reached the weight limit of his other movement toys and this could be used at nine months. We think it was a waste of money. It doesn't bounce well. It slides all over the place. He fell out of it more than once. The restraint really works best for smaller kids. At 9months he had really reached the limit and it pinched his thighs.We sold it after a few months even though I am pregnant with our second. Not worth the storage space.
5,Great CD for a workout!!,"This CD keeps me motivated while I'm working out. The upbeat tempo is great for a run, or just listening in a car ride."
4,Tough to learn but lots of fun!,Order 2 sizes bigger in order to fit properly. Likely too hard until around 5 years of age for most.
3,so-so workout,"This video was made in 1986 and you can tell. It is a 30 minuute workout that focuses on stomach, and thighs/buttocks. There are 3 different instructors. The first woman does the warm-up/stretch section, which is pretty thorough. The man does the abs section, which is pretty challenging. Another woman does the leg section, and she has a low voice, and sometimes does not cue the exercises, so you just have to watch and do what she is doing. The routine itself is OK on that section, but it helps if you already have an idea about good positioning, because you won't get a lot of suggestions about that from the one who does the leg section. Since I already bought the tape, I'll use it once in a while for variety, but it definitely won't be a favorite."
2,not so great.,I received these as an xmas present and was disappointed. They were much smaller than I thought they would be and one was already chipped. I am horrible at returning things and I didn't want to upset the person who got it for me so I kept them. The enamel continually chips away. Not worth the money for the size and then the fact that they so easily chip.
3,Dimensions,"The dimensions of this product would be very useful!! There is no way for me to know if this microwave stand will fit in my small kitchen. Disappointing, because I would probably buy it if i knew it's measurements."
3,Okay for the price,Complicated to assemble. After assembly it was okay. It was as indicated in the sales photo. Not for heavy items but great for everything else..
1,You get what you paid for.,"This thing is cheap. You probably already figured that our from looking at the price. Expect to get unproperly labelled parts and spending hours just to set it up. The thing I was most disapointed in when I set it up was that my microwave doesn't even FIT!!!! My microwave is just standard. Not an industrial size unit. So I can't even use this cart for what I bought it for, which was to store my microwave higher. Blah. Don't expect to be impressed."
3,Good customer service,"It's not the best quality, but you get what you pay for. It's what I was expecting, and has worked out very well for me. I lost some fo the screws in the process, and had to get more. They had good customer service, and were quick to respond."
3,Poor instructions,"Need more than just pictures to assemble, should be backed up withverbage. Had asked for some additional parts never received, purchasedsame at Lowes. I would never recommend. Took 2 adults 4 hours to puttogether. JMO"
2,A Blazing Single Did Not Warrant An Entire Album,"The Single Roll Wit Tha Flava From The Same Titled Album Is A Blazing Song With A Great Beat And A Who's Who Of Rap At The Time Of It's Release Treach From Naughty By Nature, Chip Fu From The Fu-Shnickens, Freddie Foxx a.k.a. Bumpy Knuckles, Queen Latifah, Heavy D, D-Nice And Dres From Black Sheep!!! The Only Problem Is That Is The Only Real Noteworthy Single From The Album. Some Of The Aforementioned Drop Songs On The Album But Nothing Real Memorable. So If You Can Get The Single Get It, But For The Price That They Are Asking Roll Wit Tha Flava Is Worth It For That One Song Alone ""A Classic""!"
2,I have to tell the truth,"I purchased this microwave from Amazon back in June of 2004. I had very little expectations knowing I was ""cheaping out"" with a microwave that was under $300. My feelings were, when it dies in 5 years or so I will replace it with a top of the line convection/ microwave. Well, I had really hoped it would at least make it to the 2 year mark!Last week we noticed a 6 to 7 inch crack going through the plastic part of the door. Overall,it has performed ok. I learned very quickly that is is very hot and I always shorten cooking times and lower temperatures. DO NOT use the popcorn setting, my 11 year old son has set 3 bags of popcorn on fire using it. I supervised, so I know he did it right!I also agree that the fan is very noisy and when it goes on automatically, you have to wait until it is ready to turn off. That process seems to take a long time!I would like to say it looks good though and it will be a challenge finding a replacement that I like as much visually!"
3,"Looks pretty, but function is so-so","It looks lovely in our stainless steel kitchen, but after only 3 years of use, it has problems. Now the start button doesn't work, but the microwave is on nonstop whenever the door is closed. Started very suddenly. Will have to get it serviced. Great defrost, potato, popcorn functions."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased my R1510 two years ago. In the first year I had to have unit serviced twice. The second time, which was fortunately two weeks before warranty expired, necessitated a new replacement unit. Well here I am a year later with same failure (some sort of a lightning storm in unit) with no warranty. Needless to say I will be looking else ware!"
5,From a satisfied customer,I received the product advertised in perfect condition. The service was great. Everything was perfect.
1,Arrived Damaged,"This item arrived via UPS with a significant amount of damage. All the molded Styrofoam in the box was broken. The bottom of the box was split open and Styrofoam flakes were falling out when I retrieved it from my porch. Upon opening the box I found the steel cabinet of the Microwave dented and bent out of shape in a number of places. Later, plastic parts that were supposed to attach the plastic facings, fell out of the oven. This item was returned and received back by Amazon. I have yet to receive a refund.I would not advise purchasing a heavy, poorly packaged item like this one."
1,design flawed product,"Avoid this product. The pushbutton melted after only a month of regular use. When the technician came to repair it, he said that he saw this problem frequently with this design. He said that units with a handle do not have this problem. Despite being careful, it has happened again. This time it is beyond the warranty & Sharp doesn't care. Whats the point of having an over the range unit, if the parts melt from too much heat due to regular use"
1,The Display WILL fail,"I have had two of these. Both of them had the LCD Display fail and the plastic buttons crack, warp and other wise fail as well."
2,Not very satisfied.,"It was totally not the vacuum I expected. It was too bulky, heavy and hard to put together.Its a good brand so I didn't expect this at all.So in all I would not recommend this at all."
2,Inadequate textbook of an already difficult subject matter,"As an undergraduate taking a course in thermodynamics of materials, I found the book to be exceedingly brief and, at times, incomprehensible. To those new to thermodynamics, the book is nearly useless. To make it even worse, the book doesn't have answers to the practice questions to allow students to check their work, and it is inadequate as a reference for simple things such as unit conversions."
4,Best book for thermodynamics but no answers to the numerical questions,This is a great book for undergraduate (and probably graduate) students. Everything is written in simple terms and complex notations are avoided. It is better to use it as a textbook with one or two other books as reference texts.The greatest downside is that it does not provide answers to the end-of-chapter problems. So no matter how much you think you are right you can never be too sure. This is a great hindrance in the development of the concepts. This book is written at MIT probably for MIT people but there are few people living outside the MIT campus who would also like to understand the subject. So for those poor schmucks Prof. Ragone should write a solution manual or at least provide us with the answers. Examples are also few and far between.This can be the greatest textbook on thermodynamics if above suggestions are incorporated.
4,"chance and Stability, Stable Distributions and Their Applications","Chance and Stability, Stable Distributions and Their Applications (Modern Probability and Statistics)I love this book. I could not find any other comparable book in English which gives so much information on stable distributions. All other books had too much maths jargon, while this is essentially a physicists book. It might have a few typos, but I did not mind it. The major defect is that there is no index."
3,It is what it is.,I sometimes like to sit and watch movies that don't require a lot of thought. This is one of those movies. Seems low budgetSci-Fi channel.
4,HOT HOT HOT,"Total erotica in every fashion face and form. Some may be a bit repulsive, but who knows what makes each mind tick? I love that these are a collection of stories from real people, whether real or imagined."
4,Spoiler Alert,"You know what I learned from this book?I had no idea women fantasized about dogs so much. (New meaning to the word ""shagged""?)And that's why I give this book a 4 star rating. You'll never look at women the same, you'll learn a lot about yourself, and you'll never take anything for granted.Some women admit things that could land them in prison, while others don't seem to realize they're describing their own child abuse. Structurally, I found Friday's commentary superfluous and many stories are redundant, making the book twice as long as it needs to be. I also wonder, are these stories an accurate reflection of general trends or did the publishers just print the juicy stuff?Either way, this book will change you. If you thought you already knew women were freaks you ain't seen nothin' yet."
4,Has a variety of memorable and exciting stories.,"Ten years ago, this was the first book of erotica that I read.I still remember many of the fantasies and stories vividly.These range from the ""standard"" to the extremely daring.The mixture of real events and fantasies is very stimulating.The women recount near-incidents that became lifelong fantasies.Many readers may enjoy having old encounters stirred back as such."
4,Opened my eyes and my mind,"I've never been one for fantasies, but this book really helps open your eyes to a world in your mind that can make life so much more pleasurable. It helps you realize that fantasizing is a good thing. An excellent book!"
2,Dated,"I purchased this book as part of a coming-of-a-certain-age package for a friend, based on recommendations of an AARP publication. Not being familiar with this author I had no expectations. So much has changed for the majority of women since this book was originally written. It may be good for those of an older generation who have not let themselves broaden their view of female sexuality/fantasy & etc. Perhaps at another time the book was helpful."
5,Wow! Awesome book!,"I actually read this book as a kid on a car trip during a family vacation and then a couple times since. I found it out of boredom while digging through my dads books in the backseat at about 12 years old. It was definitely inappropriate reading material for a kid, but I've never read so fast and with such interest. I blew through this book and have since read it a few more times.It's a fascinating and incredibly sexy glimpse into the female psyche. Exploring various topics of sexual fantasy, what inspired them, and how women feel about them is a tough subject not to engage in. If you have a sense of sexuality, this book is a must!"
1,Wasn't what I expected,This book was not what I expected and hearing what other women fantasized about was a little disturbing in some cases.
2,this book was not for me,this book was a little to deep for me did not like some of the words in the book she is right to the point but like i said to deep for me
2,musty book,"I received the used book promptly, but it was so musty, I had a sinus headache each time I tried to read it. I finally threw it into recycling. I may order a new one next time. I usually try to order used items in an effort to be environmentally conscious. This is the first time I've ever had a problem with a used book."
2,More disturbing than hot,"Another reviewer mentioned this already, but there is sex with animals. Most of the lesbian stories involved women being turned on by dogs or donkeys. I was pretty disappointed. I didn't give it 1 star, because I appreciated the work that went into collecting the stories. It was written in the 70s, so maybe that had something to do with the tone."
2,WOMEN'S SEXUAL FANTASIES AS TOLD BY THEMSELVES,"Nancy FridayMy Secret Garden: Women's Sexual Fantasies(New York: Simon & Schuster/Pocket Books, 1973) 336 pagesA collection of women's sexual fantasies as told by themselves.Good raw data for further research into sex-scripts.They seem little different from men's fantasies.Many show signs of early sexual imprinting.If interested, search the Internet for the following bibliography:""SEXOLOGY---SEX-SCRIPTS---BEST BOOKS"".James Leonard Park, author ofImprinted Sexual Fantasies:A New Key for Sexology."
2,I guess I'm more exciting than I thought....,"I purchased this book hoping to get some new ideas, be inspired, enlightened, aroused, titillated...but no, none of the above.The only thing this book did was reassure me that this world is full of a lot of sexually repressed women and even more Jerry Springer-like trashy ho-bags. There was no sensuality here. Perhaps it's because most of the text was written by amateurs but good LORD. If I were writing something that I thought would end up in a book, I'd take more care to make it interesting.There's a distinct lack of imagination AND character in our society. This book makes that painfully obvious."
1,Horrible pornographic book,"This book is not written for women. This is written by a woman to satisfy the lecherous needs of sex-starved pansy type men, who just get excited by reading such material. Majority of the people who bought, read and enjoyed this book were probably men. No woman will enjoy reading this book. Descriptions are third rated and disgrace women as slaves of men. There are much better books which will help women to free themselves and put them in a respectful position equal to men."
5,Jim McLean K7 (20 problems & solutions),Thank a lot for my purhase. K7 was arrived in time and the chipping was without trouble.The Video is correct and it's fun. PL
5,The Pinacle of Manliness,"When I awoke on my birthday, I was suprised with the man of my dreams: Prince Daniel (aka Ken). Every male I come into contact with from this point forward will pale by comparison to Ken's masculine, dark charms. I have been playing with Barbies since my grammar school days, and this Ken doll is more charming than an acceptance letter from Harvard. My shocking high SAT and IQ scores are in no doubt a result from playing with this magnificent feat of engineering called a ""doll"". Thank you, director of doll design from mattel corporation."
3,Terribal Toy for a young child!!,"I got this toy for my three year old daughter, and she loved it!She is only 3ft tall and when she dropped it on the floor his arm came off. I would recamend another barbie doll than this one!After that she wouldn't play with it. I sat it on her shelf and right now I can still see it from here. So if you have a little girl with a playful immagination I would spend your money on a better Barbie doll!"
1,I Detest This Ugly Doll,"When I first received this hideous doll from my Aunt May, I almost threw up. This has no resemblance to the Daniel I once knew. He was bold and dashing. This doll is plastic and fake. He has no true personality. This whole Swan Lake idea was just another money-making festival for Mattel. Someday, I hope they realize it's over."
2,Looked good for six months,I've had this item for less than six months and it's ripped right through already. It must have happened when I shook it out the other day though I didn't notice it right away. I haven't even washed it yet which I understand is hard on rugs. I wouldn't buy another.
4,"Good for servicemembers, not good so much for spouses","I love to read and I have read over 10 deployment books but this one though short was hard for me to read. I chose this book in an effort to understand what will go through my husbands head once he returns from Iraq. This book is targeted for the servicemembers who are coming back and encourages them to open up about their experiences and to seek help. This would make a great post-deployment gift. I liked the fact that I can better understand some of the symptoms and what to look for, but I just didnt find it so easy to read."
4,A must read for anyone in the military.,"I wish that I had read this book three years ago. This book is a must read for those preparing to go to war an those veterans coming back. Don't just ""suck it up"" like you were told from day one by your drill instructors. And do not invalidate what you are going through by rationalizing your responses away and thinking you'll get over it with time. You need to be aware of what is going to happen/has happened to you so that you can either prepare or move on."
5,Down Range,"Chuck has done it again.Another best seller for sure and a must read by every returning veteran, mother, father, wife, spouse, family member. This is an easy to read book that every combat veteran from any war can related to. As a practitioner for the Veterans Administration I am exposed to many book, pamphlets and article on the subject of Combat Stress but this book written in a layman's format is simple to read and yet education. I recommend it to all my Veterans.As a combat veteran myself, I appreciated the work that has gone into this book and believe that any veteran reading this book will find him/her self within the pages. What else can be said about this book? Put it on your must ""MUST READ"" list now. I give it 5 stars!"
5,A must read for all soldiers and families,"I received this book for free from the mobilization station when I was leaving for my overseas duty and it is available to all soldiers all you have to do is ask. A must read for all soldiers returning from operations in the Middle East. You have so many things in your mind that you cannot explain or understand and this book helps put your feelings and thoughts into perspective. I highly recommend that all soldiers request and read this book and share with their families. Acclimating back into your life that you left is a hard thing to do and it can also be quite the challenge for those left at home that don't understand what we saw and did, so help them out and give them this book! All family support centers should be able to help you out and if you can't find it anywhere in the Army system, then buy it! It is worth the cost to help understand and to help your families welcome you home again."
5,Essential reading for returning soldiers and their families,"PTSD is such a complex condition, and so often invisible to the eye. DOWN RANGE offers readers a look into the causes of PTSD and empowers them to take proactive steps for health. Part of the magic of a book like this is that it makes it okay to express difficulties and ask for help. The person living with PTSD feels less alone, more hopeful. This book is important for friends and family to read as well, so that they gain deeper insight into the challenges faced by their loved ones. There is a lot a person can do to ease the symptoms of PTSD and begin to heal. A book like DOWN RANGE can make the transition to civilian life more palatable and less overwhelming, because help is within reach. Susan Rose Blauner is the author of HOW I STAYED ALIVE WHEN MY BRAIN WAS TRYING TO KILL ME: ONE PERSON'S GUIDE TO SUICIDE PREVENTION."
3,Poorly edited,"This book appears to have been patched together from training notes, shorter pieces and other disjunct sources. While it would seem to be directed at veterans, it also has a vague orientation towards veterans' families, possibly clinicians and the general public. It is a rough read at best if you are distracted, as I am, by abrupt changes in person, misplaced and misspelled words, and unattributed scholarly representations. All in all it is too bad that the authors, both with credible depth of experience, and editors did such a dismal job of presenting very important information. The best part of the book is the lists of to-do's related to care of returning military personnel and their families. But even at that, the ragged overall character of the book makes me wonder at their accuracy and potential effectiveness."
1,Grossly over-simplified,"As other folks have said, this may be a good starting point for some GIs and families. It provides a very basic introduction to and overview of possible symptoms and behaviors.There was, and may still be a glut of these around locations where GIs return from overseas, and scattered through administrators' offices. Sad, as the book is the behavioral health equivalent of an episode of Oprah, long on generalizations and fairly obvious statements and conclusions, low on critical thought and substance.For veterans who have been deployed in locations without the amenities and security of LSA Anaconda, the introduction, with its attempt at establishing credibility via shared experience, may be insulting -combat veterans are often prickly about those who claim to share risks and hardships. Additionally, single GIs, the ones who cannot start or maintain a relationship, will likely find little help, this is a text aimed more at married folks and families."
5,Just wonderful,"Even though the heel is nearly 7"" high, they're not like wearing extreme high heels with a slanted foot (on your toes). The fit is snug but not firm, very comfortable inside. They fit large for women, comparatively, since they're sold/made for men, they are wider too."
5,This book rocks!,"This book is interesting in two aspects. One, the book acts as an interactive communication tool that has been developed based on project based learning mechanism. Two, the book allows the understanding of home construction for novices like me. In a short period of time, I was able to work on developing 3D construction models in SketchUp. Thanks to the new graphical approach demonstrated in this book, I became more involved in modeling my own dream house. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning sketchUp. For newbies like me, this book is definitely a boon! Five sparkling stars to this book!"
5,"Looks good, works fine!","This is a really nice faucet. Installing it took only 20 minutes or less, the hard part was getting the old faucet out. We really like being able to mount the handle either to the left or the right or the nozzel."
1,"Look only, don't use...","It's a pretty faucet, but in my case it didn't hold up. Lately, I've noticed water accumulating on the top of the sink around the spout. This afternoon I rebuilt the entire faucet, including new O-rings. I noticed water pooling up again this evening and found a pinhole sized hole in the spout!Every time I turn the water on, some comes out of the aerator and into the sink (good) and some drips down the spout and onto the top of the sink and counter.Stainless steel isn't supposed to do this.I expected more, especially after ponying up a couple of hundred dollars for this product."
2,It's a good thing this was only four bucks.,"First off, let me say that I am not the most hardcore Tortoise fan in the world, but have everything after TNT. Secondly, Tortoise live is a show you shouldn't miss. Thirdly, the beginning moments of this CD (except for the annoying guitar noise) sounded pretty decent. Imagine your surprise and horror when you skip ahead to track 2 and hear somebody singing off-key. Tortoise deserves better than to collaborate with a group that does nothing more than make noise and put in under a facade of 'avant-garde'. The Ex is not even in the same league musically. Save your money and buy 'Beacons of Ancestorship', or any other Tortoise CD, for that matter. If you've already made the mistake of buying this CD, all hope is not lost. You can use this CD as a coaster, or to make lemonade with."
2,Do not expect anything like TNT,"This album is not good, avoid paying money this EP, unless you like The Ex, Dutch anarchists... or art rock......For those of you who are sophisticated, this is up your alley, pure sophistication, and no pleasure"
5,Incredible Work,"I recently had the pleasure of letting award-winning poet Marie Howe listen to this album. She described it as the sublime and the shadow of the sublime working at the same time. Really abrasive, sonic rhythms from the Ex make for a nice combo with the tight, melodic orchestrations of Tortoise. An unthinkable collobartion with indescribable results."
1,Tortoise' horrid sounds collaboration,"The Ex. brings poor vocals and dischord to the the Tortoise table. These aren't even 'poor vocals' that have character to them which grows on a listener, they're just plain annoying. If your a listener that wants enjoyable sound, stay away from this album. If you're a the type that gets some intellectual satisfaction from acrid sound and The Ex.' ""punk message"" [whatever it is] then give it a listen."
2,fodder,"When I was a kid, I was both fascinated and frustrated when I tried to push two magnets (opposing poles) together.Such is this on-the-fly collaboration between deliberate and calculated Tortoise and a (punk?) band, The Ex. Listening to this I can imagine the frustration that John McEntire and family went through in the studio with those DIY/schlock rock fools.Pass."
1,Absolutely horrific.,"I would rather listen to someone dragging fingernails over a chalk board. Or perhaps the sound of ten thousand cats being chopped to bits in a combine.. or any number of otherwise god-awful noises. Train wrecks, explosions, you name it, and it would surpass this ""album"" by miles. This is probably one of the worst ""albums"" to ever be created in the history of music. I honestly feel pain and sorrow for the poor CDs that get this garbage encoded on their surface. I feel for the machines that have to press the albums. I feel sorry for anyone and anything that ever comes into contact with this ""album"". It's just so completely awful that language barely scratches the surface in describing just how mind-bendingly audaciously egregiously offensive this album is to existance itself. Don't buy it if you value your soul."
5,This is a pretty neat song.,"I remember watching this video back when it played on mtv. It got stuck in my head for awhile, and then I didn't hear anything about it for 10 years. And I couldn't remember the name of it, nor could anyone I describe the song to. I'm not positive, but I think they use a sample from this song in KMFDMs ""Godlike""."
3,A Hole in the Plot,"This late Bell suffers from a problem shared with Gladys Mitchell and Margery Allingham: many of the scenes are excellent, demonstrating fertility and ingenuity, but the same fertility and ingenuity are over-applied to the serious business of plotting, resulting in such tangled webs that their foundation lives up to the book's title. Thus, although the surprisingly Rendellesque presentation of the two murderous sisters (one of whom the doctor hero is completely taken aback to discover is a lesbian) and the scenes in the Devil's Well are excellent, the details of the crimes committed twenty years before the main action are impossible to follow, calling for mute acceptance rather than for scrutiny. A pity, for this ""crime novel"" (as critics would call it) could have been an excellent book with a little more work."
3,Dissappointed!,"I'm dissappointed with the book, I couldn't even finish it, it was boring. I got to the point where he suggests to leave the bills in a friendly box for 30 days, and just gave up reading it. I know I wouldn't be able to leave the bills for 30 days."
1,Don't waste your money!,"There is not a good example of a debt reduction plan in this book. By following the suggestions here, it would take my family 10+ years to get out of debt. I am using Mary Hunt's guide and will be completely debt-free in less than 3 years. Also, with a degree in English, I found this book aggravating to read. What's with all the subtitles? And random curse words? (No point is made by using them!) I am certain that Debtors Anonymous has helped many people get out of debt, but I was not impressed by the principles described in this book. (If I could have given in 0 stars, I would have--as soon as I was finished reading it, I put it into a designated ""yard sale"" box.)"
3,Not what I expected,"I expected this book to help plan goals and ideas to get out of debt the best way possible. Instead I found that this book only attempted to provide the right mental state to get you out of debt. Obviously, if I am purchasing books like this I am in the right mental state to get out of debt, but how do I do it. I recommend this book for the person who needs the extra shove to start getting themselves out of debt. However, if you are prepared and just want to know how to do it I wouldn't recommend this book for you!"
2,Only for people in serious debt with no knowledge of finances,"For my situation, this book was too rudimentary. I was looking for something that would give me startegies on how to payoff debt quicker. This book is not really about ways to payoff debt. It is more about learning how to spend less and seemed to be more of an advertisement for Debtors Anonymous. Things like ""Try to go one day without using your credit card""... not for me. If you're in really bad shape and spend and spend without any way to stop then seek professional help, don't rely on this book. If you're like me and just looking for ways to reduce your outstanding debt quicker, look elsewhere, this is not the book for you."
3,OK if not already making progress on debt.,"This book would be great if you were just beginning to pay off debt. My husband and I have a large credit card debt. We quit using them 4 months ago and have already planned our expences. We used his theory of not depriving ourselves. We have never been behind in our bills and have always been able to pay slightly more than the minimum on our debts. This book did not give us any new advise on how to reduce our debt quicker. However, it would have been good when we first started out, or if we had been behind on bills."
5,Lays out a simple way for debt-a-holics to free themselves,"Based on the proven principles and techniques of Alcoholics Anonymous, this book lays out a clear, simple way for debt-a-holics to free themselves from debt, and stay free -- forever. A great value for the money."
4,Good start towards solvency,"This is a good book, will help you get started towards solvency. Debtors Anonymous does not endorse this book, but it is a fine primer on the road to recovery."
4,Helpful insight,Full of helpful information that applies to real life sceniros. No kidding. A good read and would like to see more consumers read it. You would think twice.
4,Cool item...,"Good item, I'm still reading it, very easy to understand and very practical, too bad it didn't came with the CD that showed in the picture..."
4,good stuff,i found this book to be helpful and a great review for anyone who preparing to take the asvad.
1,CD-ROM is Not GOOD!!,"I really do not recommend this book because CD-rom that comes along with the text book doesn't work properly. I tried three different computers to set it up, but I failed to do so. !!!!!!!You don't want to go through the same thing I did!!!!"
1,What is the message?,"In this book, Clifford teaches children about playing dead, Emily teaches children how to leave their dog and forget about them and the author shows that drivers are inattentive because they are too busy talking on their cell phones. Great bedtime reading!?!"
1,So abominable...,"Just unspeakably bad. So horribly written... even worse than Daniel Pinchbeck. Worthy only as an exemplar of how to misuse psychedelics for purely hedonistic purposes. For a good psychedelic memoir, please see William Craddock's ""Be Not Content,"" Peter Weissman's ""I Think, Therefore, Who Am I?"" or ""Amazing Dope Tales"" by Stephen Gaskin."
3,I miss shunned stardust,"Unusual film. Hard to think it was made at the same time as 2001: A Space Odessy. Still, it is, at moments, entertaining. Essy Persson's nose looks larger than usual, but she remains cold and fetching. The special effects are (of course) usually laughible. The picture was taken from the popular comic ""Perry Rhodan"" of the day, not unlike Bava's ""Diabolik"" (taken from the French comic of the same name) made the previous year. ""Mission Stardust"" retains the same comic book-logic and ludicrous plot-lines which are the foundation of any great comic. To say the picture drags in places is an understatement, but, if you are in the mood, it is definitely worth a watch. Dig the colorful credits and title song ""Seli""."
2,youtube,"hi all, this isn't a review, just a helpful bit of advice;if you want to see this movie for free it's online on youtube under torgs drivein account. Just type in mission stardust and it will come up."
1,If you like really bad European Cinema then....,"A quirky european film from the psychodelic era that is even worse than Barbarella. The juxtaposition of theme, mood, bad music, and, low- budget production values make it laughable. The only good thing about this film is ESSY PERSSON in those outragous costumes! This movie is so bad that it elevates the work of Dino De Laurentiis to the level of mediocraty. Remember what he did with ""Flash Gordon""? Could have been better if Radley Metzger directed this film."
5,fasinating history of 1850-1880 period,Interesting tells discrimination against native americans on a first hand basis. Great detail of the indian wars of 1862. Wonderful explaination of the life of European men moving to America and taking Native women as wives. Love story.Good read.
3,Might be a good light--if I needed it :),"I purchased this light because my home does not get any light and I received a plant from a funeral which I wanted to keep. As it turns out, the plant doesn't need much light. It's doing good on it's own so I don't use the light."
3,"Some creative mixes, but my man needs beatmatching lessons","I bought this on the recommendation from some guy who reviewed another Guidance Cd and said it sounded clinical ""like it was mixed by a guy behind a sound board drinking Diet Coke"" or something like that. Well - if that's the alternatvie to Spinna's sloppy mixes I'll take it.There IS some creativity present here, but shouldn't his disregard of timekeeping DQ this mix from being anything better than average?"
3,Space saving but annoying,"We have owned the Sharp Platinum microwave for almost 4 years and it is still working great. However, the space saving design of putting the controls on the door seems like a good idea, but after a little over 2 years of opening and shutting, the LCD display on the door now has a short. With enough ambient light, you can still kind of read it, but it's very annoying. When we called a local repair shop, he said that replacing the LCD would be more expensive than buying a new microwave. I can't see tossing a working microwave, but sometimes it would be nice to see how much time I typed in."
5,Michael Shayne and Shell Scott. Move over for Ed Noon.,"I've read dozens of novels featuring Davis Dresser's Mike Shayne and Richard Prather's Shell Scott and thoroughly enjoyed them, but had never won an auction of Mike Avallone novels. I had no idea that I was missing out on such good quality.Well, sometimes you win for losing. Instead of getting beaten up old paperbacks with boring cover art, I get perfectly formatted kindle editions with the sexier covers for $0.99 apiece!""Dead Game"" was excellent, as were the first two novels in the series. They're hard boiled, but leavened with the wit and good nature of the lead character. The plots have been very good as well.I give the first three Ed Noon novels a strong 4 stars each. The extra star is for the great value."
5,Must get for beginners,"I have never written a review, but this book is really so good that I decided I just have to give it a go. For beginners in electronics and robotics, this book is a must. Also get the kit and learn while you build."
5,Just what I was looking for!,"I'm just starting into robotics and have no knowlwdge of electronics. I was thus looking for a beginners book needed to get started. I found that this book ""Robot Building for Beginners"" to be the best book to start with, even better than the ""Robot Building for Dummies"". Having got a good start with ""Robot Building for Beginners"" I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series for more advanced topics."
5,Great book...,This book is a well layed out book. If you would like to build a basic knowledge of electronics and have a robot example buy this one. With this you can build a line following robot and information is put out that allows you to build other creations.
3,"Ok starter on electronics, but lacking on robot design","This is a fairly good book, and probably worthwhile for true beginners in this area. However, as someone else mentioned, the book spends a bit too much time on basic electronics and not enough time on real life robots. There is only one simple robot discussed. The book is also lacking on schematics and left me with a sense that I knew this stuff before I started reading it. However, I have a bit of experience with electronics so my view may be tainted. For electronics, there are better books, for robots there are better books. In all, I'd say if you have learned basic electronics already, and simply want to learn more about robotics, this isn't the book for you. If you don't know anything about electronics, and simply want to see how to drive simple motors, and LEDs, and aren't so interested in the detailed electronics, this book may be for you."
2,Worthless,"I'm sorry to have had to give such a low mark for this book. At first I thought it was a sort of Beginning Electronics for Robot building, and that was fine, but soon after I realised it was just a set of instructions aimed to build the robot on the cover. The first part focuses on the tools to be used, the second part on the building.If you want an introductionary guide to robotics this book doesn't do for you. If, otherwise, you want to buy a set of instructions to build a simple, non programmable robot just for the sake of it, this is perfect."
1,Excellent Book for Beginners,"This is an excellent book for beginners in the field of electronics and Robotics. It shows you how to start working with electronics with lots of photographs which clearly illustrate what needs to be done, for example how to use a multimeter and the helping hands and tools required.It also introduces one to mechanical calculations that may be required at a practical level. It can give the confidence to one to actually build a robot. At the end of the book there is a very nice chapter on what things lie beyond the material covered in the book."
5,This book is exactly as described in the title.,"This book is perfect for a begginer or someone with a little experience. I ordered it because I had some knowldge about electronics but none related to robots. It fills in everybit of knowldge you could want, giving you the tools you need to actually accomplish something. After reading you have everything you need to build the robot in the book or something completely different and more to your liking."
4,"Fun and Informative, but Kindle eBook Sucks","I really thought this book was fun. Geared for teens, young teens, and adults who are unfamiliar with electronically controlled devices and/or beginning robotics.However, the Kindle eBook makes it difficult to use. The eBook is extremely hampered by a lack of clickable links in the Table of Contents. This means you must use the page numbers which entails using the Menu button followed by several clicks to get to the chapter page you want.On top of that, if you have a Mac computer, it won't download and it crashes the Kindle for Mac app.I highly recommend purchasing the printed book instead. Besides, it will be easier to have it at your finger tips when constructing your ""runaway"" robots.------UPDATE: If you have an iPad or Kindle Fire, it will make the book much easier to read and view the images and graphics. Plus, the new Kindle Cloud Reader feature from Amazon let's you see everything just fine... even on a Mac!!------"
4,Awesome for Beginners!,"This book is perfect for high schools and introductory college courses. Every educator should take a serious look at including this in his or her curriculum. It would make a fine summer course as well. Lab materials for building the complete robot would run under $100 per student, less when purchased in bulk. Or, since the experiments are laid out on reusable solderless breadboards, the subject could still be effectively taught at a lower cost. A wonderful way to get more students on the path to science and engineering. Highly recommended."
3,Snowy & Scott on a bad night,"C'mon people stop being nostalgic for Phil. Snowy White & Scott Gorham are playing really badly on this DVD. Lizzy could always be hit or miss live, this is miss. GREAT song selections that are fun to watch, but I wince way too many times watching Snowy and Scott hitting bad notes."
3,"Yes, I'm ready","The sound quality is spotty on this DVD. The guitars are barely audible for the first few songs, but for some reason get louder later in the show.I must say this is one of the better Phil Lynott performances I've seen on video. He has a good time. Brian Downey is simply awesome on drums.Snowy White is not one of the better guitarists that Lizzy had, and it's pretty evident on this DVD. The guy looked bored a lot of the time.All in all, this is not half bad for the year it was recorded (1981). Don't expect superior sound or video. Just dig on the rare lineup for Lizzy and the rarely performed songs."
5,AWESOME!,I love Thin Lizzy and I think that for what is out there to be had this is the best. Great line up of songs and Phil is at his best and the rest of the band is great. Sometimes the picture and sound could be better but its still great. This show is of the band not so much of the fans. Thats great to me because I just watched Stones at the park and I wanted to puke. Too many skinny hippies and not the Stones. I have seen many dvds just trashed because of that reason. We want to see the band not the fans! GET IT!
3,Save Your Money,"I agree with the previous reviewer that the photographs are of excellent quality. However, I do not think that they are a very good aid to navigation. Nautical charts provide all the necessary information (water depths, buoy locations, length scales, navigation hazards, etc.) in a more useful manner. In addition, there is very little supporting text to augment the photos. So unless you want a collection of pretty pictures, I recommend that you save your money and buy a cruising guide and a set of up-to-date charts."
5,Well worth the price,We just finished a bareboat charter trip to BVI and found that we were frequently referring to this book. It was extremely usefull in locating moorings and anchorages. I would recommend it highly. The only negative is that there were some areas missing.
3,Nice guide but needs an update,"Nice guide but the photographs definitely need an update. The colors and resolution are poor. Being almost 2008, with the cameras, technology, and prints availalble someone should seriously consider updating the quality of the guide."
5,Sometimes more valuable than the companion book!,"This is a great reference for chartering in the BVI. It is nice in that the critical information is there visually in short order vs having to dig through the companion book. The companion book is great for gaining an understanding of the different areas of the BVI, but for out on the water, this reference can't be beat!"
2,can't zip,"great heel, great price, great looking boot, shiny, but can't zip them up! cost $15 to return so ended up keeping and can't wear....shame."
4,"Not great, but enjoyable","The characters were enjoyable. Their interaction was fun. Toward the end, I didn't like that she refused to marry him and would not explain why to her father and to him. Her reason was to avoid bringing future scandal to his life, but she didn't tell him that. He could have assured her that he'd want her anyway. She didn't tell her own father how much she loved him. Her father's actions might have been different had he known of her love for Trev. I don't like conflicts and dilemmas that are caused by someone not telling the truth about their own feelings. Other than that, the story was a fun escape."
1,Sigma wireless speedometer with Heart Rate Monitor,"I thought this product was a good fit for my needs - an inexpensive wireless heartrate/speedometer. As it turns out, the directions for setting the unit were very difficult to follow and then the heart rate monitor stopped working within one week. now the battery is running low after about a month. I would have been much better off spending a few extra dollars up front to avoid the frustration and battery costs, not to mention that i now have a unit that doesn't function as a heartrate monitor. very disappointing. the upside is you get to learn from my mistake rather than making it for yourself."
1,waste of time and money,terrible instructions and a bad install setup - do you really want to be driving a set screw into your spoke? then i never could get the transmitter and head unit to sync. the main brands are so much easier to get working why bother?
1,The sigma bicycle computer is a REAL PICE OF JUNK,"I used this imitation of bicycle computer for a little more than a month with terrible results it just never work, I really do not have words to describe this nusty mistake I made buying it. I finally replace it with a real computer that cost me about $25.00 dollars a cateye by the way this nusty product (the sigma) cost me $120.00 dollars sorry I do no give it not even a star. it end at trash can."
1,locks up and stops registering,"If you stop to talk to friends this bike computer will lock up and get in a state that no longer registers speed. The only way to reset it is to take it out of the mount and put it back in, not very safe when you're trying to ride along. The rubber band mounts did not fill me with confidence and I came back to my garage one day to find the sensor on the ground. good job that didn't happen on a ride. The provided bands are not big enough to go around mtb suspension forks. Try a VDO MC1.0 Wired Cycle Computer instead it's much better (but no Heart Rate Monitor)."
2,Sigma BC2006MHR,I bought this Sigma computer with HRM and Altimeter prior to riding in the Bicycle Tour ofColorado in June 2009. I liked everything about the computer except the way the transmitter affixed to the front fork. There were problems from the start with the transmitter being too close to the spokes and hitting spokes after potholes. I was constantly adjusting the distance of the transmitter. Finally on a steep bumpy downhill the transmitter battery cover went flying off never to be found. Being a hard head I bought another one and affixed it to the fork using the second installation option. It lasted for 15 minutes of riding before that one went flying off never to be seen again. Maybe Sigma can find a better way to install the transmitter. I have had many cycle computers over the years and have never had the transmitter or part of it go flying off the bike. Nice computer bad installation design. Maybe they'll send me a new transmitter so I can go for strike 3.
5,The Future Bill Gates and Donald Trumps,"While an older book, these skills are timeless. This book is for the real potential masters of this subject.For the genuinely ambitious, the driven, the professional in business, the future and up and coming Bill Gates or Donald Trumps, or even Secretary of State!Chapters include: The Nature of Negotiation, Planning and Preparation, Strategy and Tactics of Distributive Bargaining, Strategy and Tactics of Integrative Bargaining, Key Elements in the Strategic Process, Communication Processes, The Persuasion Process, The Social Structure of Negotiation, The Role of Power, The Role of a Negotiator's Personality, Converting Win-Lose to Win-Win, Ethics in Negotiation."
4,Bad judgement can be deadly,"""Jumping the Nail"" is about a teenager named Dru, her boyfriend Mike and a 90 foot plunge called the ""Nail"" in Southern California. Dru's troubled friend Elisa wants to prove her love to Scooter, her boyfriend, by jumping with him. Because of all this Dru and Mike try to stop this from going too far or something even worse. I really like the suspense this book gives the reader. You always want to read another page. This book is also fast paced and it was hard to put down. I think anyone would like this book ages 12 on up. This is a book that everyone would enjoy, but especially teenagers. I think the message in this story is that proving the unnecessary can be harmful in many ways."
5,(...)s Review,"I read the book, Jumping the Nail, by Eve Bunting. Jumping the Nail was about young teenagers who jump a cliff called the Nail and land into the water below, called the Deep, no one has ever reached the bottom. Dru and Mike, the main characters, try to stop people from jumping the Nail. There had been many stories about what happened to those who dared to jump. Elisa and Scooter, Dru and Mikes friends, decide to jump together to show their love for each other. After they jump Elisa begins acting strange, and starts telling stupid stories, that no one believes, that down at the bottom of the Deep there is a car with two dead bodies in it. The ghost of one of the bodies tries to make Elisa stay down in the Deep, Elisa gets away and comes back to the surface. More people start to jump. Some one gets hurt, and someone dies. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes ghost stories."
4,A Real Cliffhanger,The book Jumping the Nail was a great book. I enjoyed reading to see what was going to happen next. The way the author wrote this book made it seem like a cliffhanger and I was waiting to see what would happen to the main characters. I gave this book 4 stars because i beleive that it could have been longer.
2,jumping into unfamiliar waters,"I thought this book was suspenseful and interesting, but the dialogue is strange and it seems like the author is unfamiliar with the way teenagers talk in real life."
5,3 O'Clock Rocks the 80's,"Without a doubt---one of the best 80's bands. Too bad they never got the radio airplay they deserved. If you like some cool new wave that's a little off the mainstream, then you'll like 16 tambourines."
3,Heavily Sixties-Influenced,"In order to enjoy this album, you have to get past the lead singer's incredibly high-pitched, wimpy, girlish voice. Imagine Michael Jackson crossed with Davey Jones, then crank it up an octave more and thin it out a bit, and you basically have an idea of what his voice sounds like. However, there is still much to like here. The band sounds very tight and polished, and there are some great guitar licks. ""Jet Fighter"" and the Bee Gees cover ""In My Own Time"" are great slices of '60s-inspired pop. All in all, if the preceding description of the vocals didn't put you off, and you like pop music circa '65 -'66, then you will enjoy this. Just don't try to sing along unless you're inhaling helium."
4,very good but with some limitation,This is a good blender. Received this blender by exchanging the previous one in which (the glass was cracked). Although I would suggest not to crush ice or any frozen material in this blender or atleast be careful! Otherwise this works fine.
2,"Sharp RK-51 Microwave ""Built-In"" kit:","We have our Sharp microwave installed in a wall-cabinet and didn't like the ""unfinished"" look of the appliance sitting on a shelf. We purchased the Sharp RK-51 kit to finish the installation. While it was a fairly straight-forward matter to install, I'm not overly impressed with the functionality of the product. The trim pieces surrounding the oven restrict the full-opening of the over-door to about 60-degrees, which presents conflicts when loading items. Our oven is chest-high, and the inability to fully open the oven-door makes what should be a simple task a bit of a struggle; you need one hand free to ""hold the door open"". The installation looks much nicer, but the trim-kit makes using the appliance less functional as I would have expected."
4,Did not fit .,This was ordered but didn't fit the microwave as we expected. We had to return it for that reason. Wasn't what we needed.
4,Excellent cookbook,"My wife and I have dined at Schmacher's Hotel many times for over 20 years. I bought the cookbook when it was first released and have used it so much my copy is worn out. Now, my 25 year old son wants a copy but it is out of print and I'm trying to find one for him.The recipes in this book are structurally sound and depend on all fresh, homemade components. There are dozens of great dishes I've cooked for years."
1,Damaged Goods - Terrible Packing,"You know I read the other reviews about damage, but the price was so good and the shipping was free.... decided to roll the dice.... Before you do ..... know the odds! The packing on this item is the absolute worst I have ever seen on any item. This is a heavy appliance - Shipping Weight is 84 lbs! We are talking 1/2 to 3/4 styrofoam in corners. I have literally 2x the packing for the 8 lb item I manufacture and sell. I would say if you shipped 10 of these by UPS you would be extremely lucky to get 2 that got through undamaged! Mine is going back and I ain't re-ordering. I have gotten other Sharp products and been pleased.... their appliance division just flunked my IQ test!"
2,"A great, sleek oven... if you can get an undamaged one.","We ordered one of these and were shipped an open box/customer return. The bottom of the unit was dented and the interior was dented. It made a humming/vibrating noise during microwave operations.Amazon shipped us another unit which also was an obvious open box/damaged customer return. Looks like people are dropping these during the install, then returning and the factory/warehouse people aren't even refurbishing them. It was easy to tell it was already used since the exhaust vent was not set to the factory default of recirculating.It isn't Amazon's fault, in fact they were so quick to ship another unit(2nd day fedex!). I wonder if other vendors are seeing this problem... I love the way this looks over my stove, but it looks like they wont be sending another one due to the problems with the warehouse."
1,Don't order this from Amazon! Save yourself a BIG headache.,"I ordered this from Amazon because of the low price, and they were offering free shipping and $25 additional off that day. I received the microwave and it was damaged due to poor packaging. I arranged for a return and replacement. Very easy. Second one came damaged. Amazon took it back but will not even try to replace it again. Now I found that they charged me an extra $25 even though my invoice says $431.95. I'm very disappointed in Amazon.com at this point. Why are they still selling this online, but refuse to ship me another? Interesting.... I'm going with the Dacor over the range from a local dealer. It's more money, but I know it's right and if it's not, the company will stand behind it, unlike Amazon."
2,Disappointing!,"This replaced a '95 Sharp Carousel which was a great machine; this new one is noisy, vibrates and doesn't cook bacon, potatoes, etc. as efficently. The convection feature is a plus but we don't use it much because it is very messy and takes a lot of energy in the pre-heating process."
3,Problems,"What Sharp Corporation designer ever thought of incorporating two screws, each about a foot long, to be inserted, blind, from front to back in order to pin this unit to the wall? Our installer finally had to give up on the use of these two impractical items.Other design problems are:1. The control panel is not backlit and so cannot be used easily in a dimly lit room.2. The internal light does not adequately illuminate the food."
2,Thumbs down to the excess oil in this greasy soup,"I have been a vegetarian for about 17 years and have really loved every other product by Amy's Kitchen that I tried, so I was horribly surprised when I tasted this soup. The biggest thing I didn't like was how greasy it is; it has way too much oil for someone who is used to a low-fat diet. Also, the amount of onion in the vegetable broth seems like an over-compensation for the lack of meat stock; it's overpowering. To make matters worse, the other ingredients came off as soggy (and I did not overcook). However, if you like oily broth and a lot of onion, you might like this soup. But I will not be purchasing it again; fortunately for me I only bought a single can at the health-food store rather than buying in bulk online."
3,The aftertaste is the only (very big) drawback,"I think the flavor of this soup is good, the smell is good, it's very CHUNKY and hearty. I love that there is a variety in beans, and the onion flavor is good. But the aftertaste is weird, musty and bland. I felt like it somehow needed salt, although, being pregnant, salting canned soup is just asking for it. I don't know how something with so many chunks could be so bland. It's actually deceiving, when you first take a bite, the taste is flavorful, but then you realize how bland it is. It made me really sad. It's certainly edible, but it's extremely disappointing, considering I've made multiple beans soups like this at home that were way better."
5,Possibly the best soup out of a can I have ever had,"Note that amy's products always needs salt. I nuked it for 3 minutes, sprinkled with kosher salt and doused it with 10 jiggers of Yucatan hot sauce. OMG - delish!loaded it with saltine crackers and gobbled it up so quick I was holding my breath to eat faster. Maybe the batch I got was cooked to perfection? Bottom Line: This is without a doubt in the top 5 things out of a can i have ever eaten, but you MUST doctor it up.Maybe 12 cans is a commitment for new tasters and you should sample it first. I found mine locally on sale for a couple bucks each. I am going back tomorrow to buy a whole case."
5,Wonderful,"Absolutely wonderful. There is nothing much I can say that hasn't already been said about this amazing book. The only thing I can add is to consider reading this as a trilogy...1. This book by Mabel Dodge ""Edge of Taos Desert: An Escape to Reality""2. Followed byQueen of Bohemia: The Life of Louise Bryant(was in Russia with husband John Reed)3. Finish withPart of a Long Story: ""Eugene O'Neill as a Young Man in Love""by second wife Agnes BoultonThe women are linked by their relationship with Eugene O'Neill and more loosely with the Provincetown Players (an outshoot of the Greenwich Village Free Love Scene) important movements in the early part of the 1900s in America, they seem strangely to be forgotten now. Anyway, all three are amazing to read, Mabel's & Agnes's are more like exquisitely written literature, and Louise Bryant's is a traditional biography.Mabel Dodge Luhan's house in Taos is now a lodge and one can stay there, I would recommend it, it's lovely."
3,small,I guess I should of figured it was going to be small because it says mini! But it is smaller then I thought it was going to be.
3,Mini Where's Waldo,I was not aware that the booklet would be as small as it was. The magnifier was also kind of small and not as good or easy to use as I would have wanted it to be. But it was for my grandkids to use and they like challenges.
4,"Not the Best of the Waldo books, but not bad","I loved Waldo books when I was a kid, and still appreciate the intricacy and creativity today as an adult. So I recently bought the entire set, in hardback.As I expected, the original Waldo books are better than the more recent ones, just as the original mom and pop shop is better than the franchised version. But this book is better than the Incredible Paper Chase, and though it's lost some of the creativity of the original ones, it still has a lot to offer."
3,"really, really small","When they say ""mini edition"" they mean it. Our child is really into seek and find style books and he still enjoyed it, but I did think it would be a bit larger of a book for the price. Regardless, Where's Waldo is always creative and fun and the book was still very detailed."
3,Must have a magnifier for this book,"This is your average Where's Waldo book - only in a miniature scale. You need to have a magnifier when looking, otherwise it really is just one big mess. The one I bought on Amazon was used and didn't come with one."
5,WE LOVE WALDO,"I think waldo books are great, they are not too easy for my 7 year old or myself. Great purchase for us! Better than other seek and find books."
5,Great book for Grand Kids!!!,My kids grew up with these books....it is so cool to be able to buy them for the grandkids now!!!
5,Great Gift,"I got this book for a friend that I work with for our Christmas exchange. It was a lot of fun to look through and she's still looking for Waldo, and the other things to find, so it was worthwhile. The book was in amazing condition too."
3,"When they say ""Mini"", they really mean it","I must have skipped over the exact measurements of the book if they were listed. With no point of reference in the photos, I assumed this was going to be a normal sized book and the magnifier was only needed because there was so much packed in to the pages. But this thing is SMALL. If you get this, just make sure to keep in mind it is only 6-inches by 5-inches. And from my memory of it when I gave it to my niece, those measurements may be generous. It's exactly what you expect to get in a Where's Waldo book (a bunch of pictures and things to find) but I wrote this review to emphasize it is really, really small. If I had known this when I bought it, I would have gotten one of the normal-sized books."
5,fun for adults too!,I had some Waldo books when I was a kid and recently got a couple for my daughter. She loves them and I STILL love them. A fun activity that we can do together. Some of these are pretty tough!! :)
4,Hours of enjoyment,"I am in my 30s, and I love the Where's Waldo series. There's so much to look for beyond the required items if you care to spend your time with it instead of rushing through it. Some might argue that the book is a bit pricey for the number of scenes. I can't dispute that, but for the entertainment that I receive, I consider it money well spent."
1,Not October Project...,"If you were smitten with the first October Project album's sound, and Mary Fahl's voice---this ain't it. I'm not saying it's bad music, it just has nothing to do with what I consider October Project. It's really a different thing altogether. Even the second album was showing a change of direction in a way, but this is totally unrelated. I was disappointed in Mary Fahl's solo album, too. I really wanted to like this stuff, but the very first album stole my heart and refuses to give it back. I think they really had something there."
5,A beautiful new direction,"October Project's ""Different Eyes"" keeps its focus on what the band is all about: intertwining carefully crafted language with subtly powerful harmony. Unlike efforts by other bands that have rearranged after a hiatus, ""Different Eyes"" shows that if a group's core focus is on producing great music, everything will fall into place. The sound is not so much a departure from their past work as it is a refocus on the band's musical purpose. And, as that founding members Adler, Flanders, and Belica remain the heart of the band, any OP fan--or anyone looking for a spiritual, distinguished experience--will love this album."
3,edgier sound; just not the same,"i first heard october project while shopping in an alaskan department store in 1994; i fell in love with the sound. i have october project and falling farther in on both cd and cassette;they are both well used. the latest october project is a very simple project and has an edge to it, but does not recreate the melodic sounds heard in the previous two selections. no matter what they do there is so much talent it cannot be ignored, but if you are looking for the same sound you heard in years past, this is not the cd for you.i like it, but i can't honestly tell you why!"
2,Mary Fahl-less,"Mary Fahl is THE sound of the October Project (as is Donald Fagan the Steely Dan sound, Adam Duritz the Counting Crows sound, etc.), and, without her, they are, alas, just another band. Without Mary Fahl, October Project will never be as great as they were in their two Fahl-full albums. Mary Fahl gave them the transcendent, haunting, other-wordly sound that was so very seductive. Thank God she is a solo performer now, so one can continue to enjoy the original October Project sound. (Saw her at Tin Angel last night in Philly. She continues to be great. What a contralto voice!)"
3,"Complete, but confusing and a bit dull, kids say","This is a required text for a World Civilization class my kids are taking (grade 9). They report that it is comprehensive, but the similar names and many names and dates can get confusing. The book is not written in a very engaging style, according to them."
4,Great dream book,"I like boats. I'm not interested in actually owning any of these boats, simply because they are too large for my finances. Regardless, I really like this book. It's what I call a good 'dream book', you can look thru it and daydream about having one of them like that one day. I'll be doing good to get a fishing boat that I really like, but that still doesn't stop me from dreaming. And I consider this book excellent for that. Some things in life you can get, some things you could get or might get, some things you probably will never get, and then there's some things you know you will never get. These boats fall into the never get category for me, but that doesn't stop me from dreaming, everyone needs a dream or two. Good book, lots of pictures and drawings."
4,Train Sound Effects,"A nice product for adding sound effects to a train layout. Most of the sound effects seem realistic. Paid around $65; $55 would have been better for overall product value. Volume could be somewhat louder, especially while trains are running. Overall, it's a good alternative rather than purchasing pricey train outfits with embedded sound systems."
2,Not worth the cost .,Was very disapointed with it.Had to return it for clicking sound coming from one speaker even when volume was off .Quality of sounds were very unreal .Not worth the price .
3,Mrc symphony,Not much volume had to add a amplifier so I could hear it.sound effects are pretty good I had to work the volume control many times to make it move easy.
3,Oddball outing for Jack,"This here is the 9th Repairman Jack, after Gateways and Crisscross. I'm a big fan of this series, and I enjoyed reading this one, but it's not one of the best of the series. I've loved all of Jack's adventures, tho I'd rank this one with Legacies as the 2 weakest of the series. Don't start reading here. Start with The Tomb."
3,Suspenseless,"Early on I was beginning to suspect that the plot would be baldly straightforward. Unfortunately, the foreboding was justified; the plot is minimal, without any cleverness, or unexpected twists. The ending was telegraphed early and often. Not much in the way of redeeming characters; less Abe, Gia, and Vicky than I'd prefer. Brother Tom was not interesting; one dimensional, and unpleasant.My expectations had been high, as I had enjoyed its predecessor in the series, Criss Cross (I think). I would just have soon skipped this one.A weak three stars."
5,Great,The RPJ series ais a super line of novels that lead you to the end of the world as we know it. Or maybe not?
3,Good read but lacking a little something...,"This was very creepy at 3 in the morning with still 50 pages to go, but when it ended it seemed a little too easily wrapped up, and in the light of day the next morning, definitely dropped a star. I enjoyed the search for sunken treasure, but I've read enough Clive Cussler to roll my eyes when they found a sunken ship in one afternoon using only scuba gear and an underwater hand-held sand blower."
4,"Still Jack, but...","I want to start off by saying I liked the book a lot. It was Jack, so it was a great ride from start to finish. That said... it didn't FEEL like Repairman Jack. The fix-it portions of the book were all too short. Speaking of too short, the book itself felt way too slender.The book was a satisfying tale, like an episode of your favorite tv show. The only problem is that this is all we get for at least a year. In my opinion, it was barely enough to tide me over until the next book is in my hands (and I am buying the next book, no worries about that).I just hope the next book manages to balance the fix-its with the Otherness elements a little better than this book did. Part of the thing I love so much about Jack is watching his plans unfold, watching him bring righteousness to the wicked. This book sorely lacked that aspect and it was felt.So I say pick it up. Jack is Jack is Jack. I just hope that the next book is a little more satisfying."
4,Another great Repairman Jack thriller,This is the last Repairman Jack novel I have read and completes all of them for me. Now I have to wait for the next one. A great series of thrillers that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
1,Disappointed!,"I am the number one RJ fan! I have read INFERNAL and found it one of the worst Repairman Jacks books yet:-( It started out good (first 50 page's), but then went from boring to flat! It felt as if Paul Wilson was in a hurry to finish it. It lacked action and did not contain anything supernatural. The above review by written by Stephen Christensen ""urban prankster"" SAYS IT ALL!"
2,"Down, down down the RJ series goes...","I had hoped that ""Crisscross"" was a bump in the road, but sadly, FPW's interest in Jack seems to have crossed over to the Otherness. The ridiculous stain transfer sequence was a new low for a writter I've loved for many years. The series needs a good repair or two..."
1,Didn't last very long,This item lasted less than 6 months before crashing into a state that could not be recovered from.USB/line in connector setup very non-standard.Would not recommend
4,"Alluring, fascinating and sensual","Lady Tess Farnsworth bitterly accepted the royal decree to wed the man whom she detested above all. The gloriously handsome Earl of Easterby had failed her in a desperate time of need, and her only solace in wedding him was the promise of vengeance. First, Tess plotted to seduce the Earl. Too late, she realized that the man she sought to seduce was himself a master of seduction. I thought it was a great love story."
3,'A Dance in Heather' is a dance in seduction!,"Lady Tess Farnsworth, a wealthy heiress, finds herself wed against her will to the Earl of Easterby, by the king for her inheritance. An inheritance that will be used to further the king's expeditions abroad and continue his persecution of the Lollards, otherwise known as heretics; one of whom was Lady Farnsworth's own father. In her heart she feeds hatred, plans revenge and death for the man she believed could have saved her father from the executioner's fires, the Earl of Easterby. However, the Earl of Easterby has a revenge of his own for the reluctant, opinionated, outspoken willful bride; seduction and love."
5,A Pleasure,The best book on FMF I've read. I enjoyed the personal touch and good research done by the editor.
1,Lanyard does not fit the IPOD Nano - returned it,The mechanism that is used to attached the lanyard to the IPOD nano is too large and is not compatible with the nano. I had to return this item.
1,very poorly designed headphone,"Two days after I received the headphones, the right earpiece stopped working. I'm not happy about the purchase at all."
2,camcorder case,This bag could be a bit larger and have more pockets. Quite small for the price. Just paying for the name on the bag!
4,Verrett is a star Tosca!,"Verrett and MacNeil, along with the great Pavarotti in his prime, make a ""golden age of singing"" cast. Maestro Conlon deserves mention for his intense conducting and superior musicianship! The only drawback is that this was before the days of HD, so the picture isn't perfect."
3,Product Defect,"The reason I give this product only 3 stars is because the Bonus Features do not play; and I tried this on 2 different computers (Macs). But rather than going through the trouble of contacting the seller, etc., I simply copied the DVD and was then able to access the Bonus Features via Quicktime movie playing software. Still, for a DVD not to work in its entirety...that's pretty sad.I'd have to give 6 stars for the music and performers, though. What a cast. What a performance. Pure perfection by all. Un-be-lievable!"
2,I should know,"Amazon should indicate whether the opera is sung in theater or is filmed in a studio. Personally I do not like operas filmed in studio, I like to see and hear singers singing on stage. Those who bought Tosca and Madama Buterfly are filmed in a studio and there is no way of knowing until they reach, so I have not been satisfied with the purchase of these two DVDs.GreetingsJosé Luis Lira"
2,Disappointing,I was hoping for the performance from Italy sung in 24hrs at the actual locations. I did not look closely enough into the detail and was mistaken in assuming from the cover that it was the DVD I wanted. I shall certainly look more carefully next time. This is a very insipid performance compared to the one I was expecting.
5,OUTSTANDING!,"This is the best ""Tosca"" in movie. Actually, the other video recordings available are of lesser quality, v.g., that insipid movie with the ""satin doll"" Gheorgiu and her anodyne and boring screamer-husband. There is also a Corelli's ""Tosca"", which is not problematic because of the singer, but because they substituted (I think for aesthetic reasons) La Caniglia for an actress, for she was old and fat at that time (end of her career).Well, this is a wonderful, really amazing movie. Kabaivanska is just fantastic, deliverying powerful drama from the beginning to the end. Domingo is an excelent, totally convincing Cavaradossi, and his singing send chills down the spine...Milnes is a great surprise, for I was not very fond of his somewhat ""barking"" sounds. However, judging for this recording, I have to say that he is dramatically and technically convincing.Well, the rest of the cast is very good as well, the Sacrestano is a very good singer.Buy it! You will not regret."
5,The Best Visual Tosca of its Day,"The 'gimmick' here is that the opera is performed to a previously recorded soundtrack so that the visuals could be photographed in the actual Rome locations where the plot unfolds. That said, and somewhat because of it, this is one of the most (fairly contemporary) enjoyable 'Tosca' videos on view. Kabaivanska is ravishingly beautiful, Domingo is handsomely heroic and Milnes (slightly past his prime) is handsomely sinister and uses his estimable voice to alternately snarl and coo appropriately. At the time of the recording these three were among the best in these roles. We're fortunate that they were caught on video to be enjoyed over and over. Highly recommended."
5,A most welcome release,"I have nothing t add to the review of L.Mitnick.A fabulous ""Tosca"" performance. Buy it!"
3,Nothing new here,"Being an inveterate Pavarotti fan, how could I NOT buy this DVD despite the fact that ""Tosca"" is not one of my favorite operas. However, the only ""impressive"" moment came right at the beginning when Pavarotti first comes unto the scene, fleet-footed and practically leaping into view. We are so used to see a much slower Pavarotti.Otherwise, this DVD added nothing to existing DVDs and CDs of this opera. It is neither special nor exciting and if anything, it belongs to Cornel Macneal - a positively towering, evil-dripping Scarpia.In comparison with Pavarotti's later ""Tosca"" with Kabaivanska from Rome, despite the awful production and Ingmar Wixell's Scarpia who cannot hold a candle to Macneal's, I find this latter one far more alive and engaging.Steffi B. Rath"
5,Kabaivanska is the greatest Tosca of all time.,"Raina Kabaivanska is surely a composer's dream. She not only sings Tosca; for a couple of hours, she IS Tosca. Her voice is glorious and she is an actress of the first magnitude. Add to those enviable qualities, she is beautiful to look at and moves with extraordinary grace. She and Placido Domingo (Mario) are superb together. Raina Kabaivanska is stellar. Any opera lover must have this video. One never tires of its beauty. For the scholar, this is the definitive verisma in all its purity. No other Tosca rises to such heights of excellence! G.K. Brown, DMA Prof. of Music (Ret.)"
3,"Well made, serve the purpose well, but no color option","It is a good design, easy and comfortable to hold, serve the purpose well. But, there is no color option when you order. I am end up with the one in dark blue (the dull blue), which really doesn't encourage my daughter to use it every time."
4,Well written...,"Tess Reynolds is a boss of a succesful security firm. She doesn't need anyone (mind you, I must say, any man) to help her. That until she meets Ethan Booker, a charming medical examiner. They are forced to solve a mystery together. I must say, I really enjoy this novel more than two other Ms. Moore's works. I love the story especially Ethan's character who is very funny guy. He has great sense of humor for someone who usually deals with dead bodies. Not to mention the scenes are sometimes surprising, like when the two of them get uhm...blown up together."
4,Excellent Book in Excellent Condition,The book came perfectly package and in neat order. Would do business again with seller.
1,SHARP MICROWAVES -- TOTAL JUNK!,"Purchased this Sharp R-1501 microwave -- display started going bad within a year -- Sharp repaired once ""as a courtesy"". Now the microwave comes on by itself and does all types of screwy things -- Fear that it will burn my house down -- Sharp will not do anything about it -- Can you believe this? -- Am going to throw this POS in the dump and NEVER buy another Sharp product."
1,Same problem with the display,The display went out on mine also. I will not by a Sharp product again.
3,Amazon returns,"Unfortunately I only ordered one pickup but amazon sent and charged me for 3. Surprised to find that I had now paid $653 I figured it was meant to be that I have installed in my D16. HD 28 and a jamon Zeiler handmade.Well only one pickup worked, two are defective. Returns our not easywith amazon. No response no one returned email.I had to have guitar center take care of my returns. Thank you guitar center.Shame on you amazon. because the purchase date is when returns start from you lose a week immediately. Then to have them professionally installed. I recommend carefully thinking when considering high end products that require a luthier to install.Dr. BernsteinI have not yet heard this pickup to comment on its clarity and sound quality"
4,PSP 25 in 1 Accessory Kit,"The 25 in 1 PSP Accessory Kit is a must have for PSP gamers. The PSP grip inside the kit provides perfect comfort for people who find it too heavy to hold. The stickers were cute and kind of reminded me of Final Fantasy. However, the PSP screen protectors, when applied properly, left my PSP screen with hard, nasty bubbles.The hard crystal case does not fit right around the buttons and caused some of the battery cover to peel off, but the soft silicone case fits perfectly. There were plenty of UMD cases (8) and are useful, and the headphones have a convenient carrying case. The packaging of the kit itself was very difficult to open, but this is to protect the items and ensure nothing is stolen or damaged. The emergency charger and car charger is a MUST have for gamers traveling long distances. I would rate this product 4/5 stars.If you love PSP, I would definitely recommend buying this product."
1,Lotsa Stuff,"I would have liked to see a better description of the contents of the kit. Several things were not needed. As an old man buying a present for a grandson I feel like I got a lot of filler and little useful articles. Honestly, I felt misled."
4,Some tales better than others,"As with all anthologies, good authors but some stories were naturally better than others. I myself would have liked to see some tales by actual magicians and illusionists included."
4,English grammer and useage,"i found the english punctuation and usage very convenient and usefull as a quick reference guide. i would recommend this and its counter part.it is usefull for adults ,who have been away from formal education for a number of years, since school ,and usfull for children who are looking for guidence when studing this subject."
5,"If you like Koontz, you'll love McGrew!","This novel has something you rarely see in thrillers: a supporting character. Every hero should have a sidekick like Cramer, and Jake Crowley does. Good going, Chad!"
2,Boring,"This game is a lot of fun once you start, but slowly fades away. The missions's are repetative ""destroy the other bot's"". You may also have to accomplish up to 5 or more tasks to complete these missions without being able to save. Games based on movies already suck and this just adds to the dissapointment."
3,Pretty good game,"This game is no Halo but if your a transformers fan or a fan of these games I would play it, some of the action sequences are pretty challenging and fun and the graphics are gorgeous. Good sound and CGI animation as well."
2,Its poor gameplay but passes the time,The controls are crap. In many scenes where you have to straighten up the guy is turning in all different directions. Its a fun game but that is frustrating.
3,Not quite what we thought it would be,My husband and son love the movie so I thought I'd buy them the game. It's much harder than I thought it would be. I myself have never played it (they hog the xbox 360 all the time) but my husband said it's too hard for even him to play. He's read the directions but still can't play it well. For us it doesn't meet our expectations but it might meet or even exceed the next persons.
2,Generally Frustrating,The game seemed cool...until the second chapter. I always get irritated when game-makers create characters and situations so difficult to control that it's nearly impossible to complete a task. Challenging players is fine; frustrating them is not.Thank god I only payed $10 for this one.
4,Fun game,It is a fun game for both my boys. It would have been nice if it were two players though. But they do love the game.
2,Don't buy it. Funding horrible games makers gives them an OK for making them,"I bought this game when it first came out. I paid $75 for it at Wally World. It will be the first and last movie themed game ever. This game is run on some game engine that although appears to be like a sandbox, it's very limited. Graphics were ok, but gameplay gets 1/5 stars. Everything elses was pretty bad too."
4,"O.K., but something's missing...","This volume is satisfactory in that it presents Land Rover vehicles in action with many colorful photos and good text, but the content belies its sub title(""British 4-Wheel Drive from 1948""), for it shows very few photos of Land Rover vehicles between 1948 and the Defender model from the late '80s. A bit disappointing for ""early"" Rover enthusiasts. But great for Defender owners!"
1,worked the first time,"I used the sifter once and it worked great. I cleaned it as recommended and put it away. I took it out to use it months later and now it will not work. I can see the mechanism spinning when the handle that contains the battery is removed from the sifter, but as soon as I assemble it, it will not even turn on."
3,Scenes Missing,"I just watched Paradise Road on DVD and was very disappointed. I didn't see scenes I remember in the VHS version. I like the movie very much, but would not have purchased a version that was shortened. There are two scenes I remember from renting the movie previously. Those being where Jennifer Ehle meets her husband while he is attempting to escape the men's camp, and also the scene where Miss Drummond is buried and Glenn Close's character begins to hum and tap the Bolero piece the orchestra did. I have no idea why Fox would delete those scenes. The cover of the DVD indicates the movie is 132 minutes long, however my counter stopped at 110 or so. So please be forwarned, if you purchase the DVD you will not get the whole movie. Other than that, I would say the movie is worth having in a home collection."
5,"Moving, Magnificent, Mesmerizing!","Paradise Road, has got to be the most moving War Time movie I have seen (the Patriot coming in at close second).It is of a POW camp of woman in Sumatra who undergo terrible conditions where their own friends drop - one by one from disease, or perhaps execution. In spite of all this they still manage to show the barbarious Japanese that they still had some spirit left by forming their own vocal orchestra.Cate Blanchett's performance is to be noted as in it she faces death were it left me in tears to watch her demise in the Pacific sun. She moved me incredibly and when I watched it I was sure she was my favourite actress.Paradise Road is a must-see! If you have to see two films in your whole life-time watch this.... then watch it again! ;-)"
4,Long overdue story that needed to be told,"It amazes me that so much has been said about the unjust internment of Japanese people in the U.S. during World War II, but so little has been said about the INFINITELY more brutal internment of innocent civilians in Asia by the Japanese at the same time. This film could not have done a better job dramatizing these events according to mainstream Hollywood standards. There's probably some sugarcoating of events, but not as much as I would have expected."
1,"Please, spare me the reptile.","I am disturbed greatly by this film. Glenn Close is entirely unbelievable as a prisoner of war... more, a bourgeois / socialite / horror. The only thing that made me smile throughout the film was the lesbian subtext of Cate Blanchett and Frances (uber-german stoic) McDormand's relationship."
3,April Cornell 's scrapbook book,"I love April Cornell's style. I own her previously issued decorating book and I just love it. However, I was disappointed in this (scrapbook) book by April. I feel it did not give enough scrapbooking ideas. Most of the pages were filled with photos of April's family's scrapbook, sort of jumbled about. The photos are wonderful, but the ideas are limited."
5,Tonka Loader,my two year old grandson LOVES this truck. He just sometimes get frustrated because the bucket of this truck does not held items well. It is not a very deep bucket.
4,Tonka Tough!,My son got this for his 2nd birthday and it is a HIT! He loves to drive it around and scoop stuff up with it.It's a GREAT size - nice and large. It's very sturdy - definitely built to last - like the tonkas I remember from my childhood!I definitely recommend this for any child 18 months+
3,awkward controls,The Tonka loader is sturdy and easy to play with if the child is on her knees moving the toy manually. It is very difficult to sit on the loader to control the loader from there. The child using the loader in my home is almost three.
5,Great toy for Babies learning to walk....,"So, my 1 year old little boy had his first birthday party and got this toy among many other toys. He instantly fell in love with this truck. Another toy he got that day was an Elmo Live and he literally ran over it with this truck. He got the ball popper wihich he paid no attention to. He got a lawn mower that makes popping noises and he paid no attention to it either. If you can see in the picture of the truck the big red handle above the shovel...he stands and holds this handle and walks with the truck pushing it backwards. I guess he loves it so much because he is learning to walk and this gives him the mobility he wants. He gave my wife out following him around. Great toy! Don't pass it up because of the mindless bad reviews. I am only speaking for boys around the time they are learning to walk."
5,better than stainless and replaces non-stick,"i had been looking for a safer alternative to non-stick cookware, and didn't like the upkeep of stainless. le creuset is the best. it's fantastic to cook in, heats thoroughly and evenly, and clean up is a piece of cake! i mean really and truly. i love this skillet, though i do have a vintage piece, so my enamel is the gray, shiny kind.the only thing it doesn't work well with is eggs & pancakes. i'm keeping a small, well monitored non-stick around just for that purpose. i may try one of the newer models in the future; i know the new black enamel is supposed to develop a patina to compete as a total non-stick solution.this is a great size. if you need something bigger, i highly recommend the buffet casseroles!UPDATE 2010: i got the 12"" skillet with the new black enamel and after 3 uses, it's already acting non-stick. awesome! i will be buying the 6"" for pancakes now."
4,Teflon Replacement,"After reading about the cancer-causing properties of Teflon, I got rid of my Teflon cookware and purchased the 10"" and 9"" LeCreuset skillets. I was a little skeptical at first because I had tried cast iron before and wasn't happy with their results and upkeep and general dirtiness (Hey, it is not for everyone). What more can I say then I am completely sold on my LeCreuset now.This is what I have found: Though they are less 'sticky' then stainless, they are not as non-stick as Teflon. They clean up just as well as my stainless. I can pick up the hot skillet bare-handed without an oven-mitt, but it does get warm. My 10"" skillet chipped (a small chip) when I accidentally banged the edge against the other skillet so you have to be careful when wielding them. And compared to stainless, they weigh a tonne.All in all, I am completely satisfied with them as a Teflon replacement, and will buy them again when the need arises."
5,Love my pan!!,"I've been searching FOREVER for healthy cookware that won't leech weird things into my food or into the air, but I held off on buying a le Creuset until now because I was afraid my eggs would stick. There was also the price issue. I actually ordered a dutch oven first, and I love that, so I figured I would buy this pan to use for omelets and stir frys. I haven't used it a whole lot yet, so I'll have to update this review once I do, but so far, I'm very impressed! I've made an omelet in it twice now, and it didn't stick at all! It's a little challenging getting the omelet onto a plate after it's done because the pan is so heavy, but overall, I'm very pleased (:"
3,Nice looking skillet. But its NOT non-stick.,"As many others have noted, this is a fetching skillet: beautiful and solid.Purchased it for safety issues surrounding teflon, though it should be noted that the Cherry and Flame models have cadmium on their outer finish - but NOT on their frying surface. This cadmium, however, is chemically fixed according to Le Creuset.Let us be clear about one thing though, the skillet is NOT non-stick. Sure if you apply enough oil, you get non-stick characteristics, but thats the oil doing the work, not the skillet. Seriously, don't be fooled.Also, I don't believe you can cure these pans (I certainly have had no success, and am open to suggestions).Would I purchase it again? Surely not for the (absent) ""non-stick"" surface, but maybe cause it looks so darn nice and its enameled surface is inert.In hindsight, I would likely have gone ahead with a high quality pre-seasoned cast iron skillet, and had given it the little bit of maintenance/love it would have required."
4,Seriously Weighty but Quality Cookware,"My husband and I have been using this skillet for about 5 months now. He uses it more often than I because it's so heavy -- really almost too heavy for me to comfortably lift it with my wrist. But the black enameled surface cooks very well, and we've used it to go from stovetop to oven several times. Since it's enameled on the inside, I feel more comfortable being able to clean it with soap and water instead of just wiping it out as is recommended for plain cast iron. The skillet looks great while cooking and serving, love the versatility."
1,Stick Stick and more Stick,The coating that Le Creuset applies to all of their black surfaced enameled pans sticks to food as it cooks. I mean really bad sticking to the point that the product requires almost full time attention. You are much better off buying a standard cast iron pan and conditioning it with oil the old fashioned way then buying any of these products. You will also save about 85% on your purchase.
3,"Le Creuset 10-1/4-Inch Skillet with Iron Handle, Red","Heavy duty and looks great, even cleaning is fairly easy, but it's definitely not non-stick."
3,Le Crew-Amazon,I think it needs to be seasoned as things stick in it easily. Forgot how heavy cast iron is for arthritic people.
1,WORST SKILLET EVER!!!!!,"Don't get fooled by all the rave.I bought this skillet for $120! And followed all the ""care"" instructions (you'll end up doing more work for the skillet than the work it will give you back!). And since the first time I've used it, ALL FOOD IS STICKING! All my meals, without exception, come out a mess because no matter how much oil I put, they stick and I have to scrape them out.The skillet is extremely heavy, you'll need to work out to be able to carry it and to put your food in plates (it almost fell on my foot once, and would have totally crushed my bones).Finally, after following all the instructions in the manual, rust started to show within few weeks. Ugly brown rust that gets on your finger when you swipe it on the skilletSo much work, so much time, and so much money spent on something I hate because I believed all the rave reviews here. Make sure you do your research first. Don't get fooled. This is the worst (and most expensive) peace of kitchenware I've ever had!"
2,"My eggs stick to this, unusable :(","We bought this hoping to use it, but due to the fact that my eggs stick to it we have not used it more than twice."
4,Beautiful piece - but not as amazing as I expected,I would love it so much more if it was more resistant to food sticking. Maybe I just haven't figured out how to work with the enamel coat on the inside. Heats and cooks well and thoroughly though.
5,The best,I have the larger pan and I love it. I thought it would be a great gift for my good friend to cook with.
5,Nice Pans,"I have used LeCreuset Pots for 20 years. They are pricey but if you treat them well, they last a long time and are easy too clean. They produce great food if you know how to use them to your best advantage."
3,"Nice , solid pan","An electric oven is my only option, and this pan works very nicely, evenly distributing the heat. However, this pan is definitely not ""non-stick"". Alot of things stick to it."
2,Same failure of product twice; stay away,"We bought this unit when we redid our kitchen in 2002. After a few years, the metal piece inside on the right side seemed to wear away and the oven caught fire. We replaced the unit with an identical unit bought on Amazon (no criticism of them). After about two years, the new unit had the exact same problem: the unit seemed to wear away in the same spot and caught fire. In both cases, there are smoke marks in the same spot, on the inside right near a metal panel.I am of the opinion that this unit is not safe and seems to have a design or manufacturing defect. Also, the second unit we bought was noisier and seemed to have some sort of mechanical problem, based on the noise it made when in use. If i can find another unit to fit the built in space and trim kit, i will buy that over the Sharp unit. I will also be trying to contact Sharp to see if they have any response to this problem. I will report in if i do hear anything from them."
3,Sharp R-530ES,Nice unit but vibration noise when operating. Bought 2 reconditioned units from other vendors and both were defective.
1,BAD! BAD! BAD!,"Our first one showed up badly damaged and Amazon did a great job getting a new one to us straight away. The second one never worked, it sounded like a tank and then just died. Stay away!"
5,nice microwave,"I'm a fan of Sharp microwaves. This is my third one. I got my first in 1988, it lasted until 1999. I got my second in 1999 and it lasted until 2009. I expect my next microwave review to take place in 2019.This microwave has plenty of power to heat quickly, yet the sensor reheat function is fantastic. Put in a plate or a bowl, hit sensor reheat and voila! perfectly heated food. I didn't expect this feature to work so well, but i find i use it all the time. Aside from that, it's easy to clean and pretty quiet. I'm not a fan of handles on microwaves so I'll recommend it as easy to clean as well."
2,Works great....when it works.,"Our Sharp Microwave of this model type is built in-so that means I'd have to find an exact replacement size-wise, or do (expensive) cabinet modifications and throw away the costly stainless steel trim kit. So I am now looking at buying our THIRD replacement. After 4 years, the magnetron suddenly burned up in a burst of flames on the first one. The door switch just failed on the second one. (after less than two years). Ridiculous.We are adults-we don't abuse things and we are not heavy users. Do yourself a favor and avoid getting yourself in this trap."
5,Same as Dacor,"Our Dacor microwave of 9 years had rusted out inside on the back wall. Since the unit was a built in, the only microwave that would fit was the same model from Dacor. In checking on replacing the Dacor I found the least expensive price to be $535.00 before shipping. During a chance conversation with an appliance repair person, he told me that Sharp manufactured the Dacor and might be cheaper! I check the Sharp models and found the R-530ES to be identicle to the Dacor with different badging.We purchased the Sharp R-530ES for only $306.00 delivered.The Sharp mirowave performs identicle to the Dacor. We are extremely pleased with the unit. It actually has more features than are old Dacor."
2,Damaged during shipping,"Beautiful microwave oven however the door was dented during shipping. Amazon was superior in the returns department. Will reorder same microwave.UPDATE: Received a second microwave. It was more damaged than the first one! Plus the door was uneven and when turned on makes a strange sound. I'm returning this one as well. Amazon gets an A+ for their help with returns, the microwave gets an F. I would strongly recommend you stay away from this product."
4,beautiful,"looked beautiful and elegant, but was damaged during transport, thus had to return it. otherwise i had no doubt i would have kept it"
1,I am not at all happy with the product.,I am not happy with the product at all. The glass door is so much foggy that you can not see anything inside. The door itself is so much dirty that the spots can not be removed at all. Overall I am not happy with the product at it was advertised.I would actually like to get a replacement of the same.Send me an e-mail for what to do next. Let me know if I can get a replacement.
2,Poor quality,"The first one I ordered was damage in shipment, so I reordered and received one in good condition. Afer 30 days the interior light stopped working. I have found the sensor cook is not consistant. I do not recommend this product"
5,Very Happy,Product was delivered ahead of schedule and in perfect condition.This is my second Sharp microwave and have always been satisfied.
4,Great Microwave,I love this microwave. We had a small problem which was covered by warranty. It's working great again.
1,Piece of Junk - Multiple Problems,"After reading reviews about this thing bursting into flames, I guess I got off lucky. The door is not hinged properly. Inferior materials creates a sag and misalignment. This misalignment of the door opening resulted in my push button mechanism breaking. I am sure it is probably a little piece of plastic that snapped on the inside. I now have an oven I cannot open w/ out the use of a screwdriver to pry the door. Also, only 1/2 of the light panel display works, so I have to try to interpret the disply with only half of the info. I've had microwaves since the 70's and never had one that broke. This one not only is broken, but has multiple defects. Didn't Sharp used to be a reputable brand? I will not be buying another Sharp anything. Unfortunately, this is built in and I need to find an exact fit. Any suggestions from readers on what would replace this model is appreciated."
2,Holy typos!,"This was my first Kindle purchase and I am a bit disappointed not by the book, but by the amount of typos in the text. I am sure Mr. Maugham would turn over in his grave if he knew that his work was so poorly represented in this modern format. Never underestimate the power of spellchecking and proofreading!"
4,"Nice pattern, but not as versatile as gel stick-ons","These are very nice snowflake window decals. Subtle but pretty. Note, though, that they really are window clings as the name implies. They stick to glass, but not the various other surfaces that Gel stick-ons (e.g., Gel Gems) adhere to. They are a very thin plastic, which is fine for some applications but is good to know up front."
4,"Vinyl Snowflakes - cute, but bad customer service","Overall, I like these snowflakes. They took more than a month to come, though, and the shipping cost more than the product. Definitely would not order from this company again."
5,A treasure!,"Finding these symphonies collected, remastered, and at value price- not to mention back in print- is truly exciting. Krips proves himself a energetic and thoughtful Mozartian, and the Concertgebouw Orchestra (especially the strings- what a lush and layered sound. Wow!) is nothing short of amazing. These symphonies were recorded over different sessions in '72 and '73, but the transfers are warm, vital, and really generously show the depth of this great orchestra. A friend turned me on to Krips' work just recently, and I must say that this set must share some space on the shelf with some of the greatest recorded Mozart symphonies I have heard. A treasure!"
4,krips:mozart symphonies,"Despite their recording age these recordings are marvellously clear, precise and buoyant. I had some of them on vinyl; now long gone so it was a particular pleasure to replace them, together with symphonies I did not previously possess.Father Philip MillerSouth Africa"
5,Krips Conducts Mozart,"Nothing is better than Krips conducting Mozart! Excellent! I had records (LPs) of Krips conducting Mozart's Last Six Symphonies, which I had been trying - with no success - to find on CD; so you can imagine how happy I was to find this here!"
2,Nokia cell phone batteries,I think these were used as they don't really hold the charge better than my old ones. not very pleased.
1,Phone batteries,"I ordered two batteries for my and my wife's Nokia cell phones. They arrived in a reasonable time and I charged them to be sure they were ready for the phones. However, the charge didn't last as long as the old batteries that I was replacing. I charged them a second time and they lasted about half the time of my old ones. I then put them in my desk and I am using my old batteries again.I did not contact the seller because I didn't want the hassle of sending them back, paying more shipping, and perhaps receiving another set that weren't any good. I will get another set for my wife and I when I am near the Nokia store in the city."
2,Disappointing Product But Good Customer Service,"I purchased this battery and upon first use, it didn't remain charged for more than an hour, which is really unusual for a new battery. My phone would cut out constantly, which was really inconvenient. I wrote the company I purchased the battery from and received a new battery free of charge after about two weeks. I haven't tried to use the new battery, but I'm hoping it works better than the first."
5,Shoul immediately be released on dvd!,"This is a classical restaurant business movie, one of the first, today there are many. Few have captured the atmosphere of a typical tradtional restaurant like this. It's from the 60s and shows a different quality of restaurant business."

2,concerned,"I recently purchased Barbie for my 4 year old daughter however within minutes of the box being opened the wings fell off. Not only this but the very small button which makes the wings move up and down fell out causing me concern as its soo small it would be a choking hazard for my 18 month year old, is their a recall ?? Or am I just unlucky?"
4,Check prices twice,I received this doll recently for my daughters birthday. It is very beautiful. However my real complaint is... I began my shopping fairly early to get the specials. I paid the regular list price ( which is much less at target than anywhere else). Right after I had received my doll they lowered the price almost 2 dollars. Which is a bit upsetting. So Checkprices more than once and don't forget that tomorrow the price may have dropped. I had a similar price change happen with walmart but they e-mailed me and told me that I would be credited the discount. Target should offer a service like that.
2,Dissapointing!,"Odette has ""rubber like"" legs, and her ballet shoes are held on by clear rubber bands, what will come of her shoes when my daughter loosens the rubberband -- also her necklace is just hanging on...almost falling off -- oh and falling off -- how bout those darn wings? I had to use the wire tie from the package to keep them on her. I think the key here is SNAP ON -- SNAP on EVERYTHING -- MATTEL! Snap on her shoes - her necklace, and those darn wings! Her toes will never fit another pair of shoes why not glue them on! I'm sure in about a month, my daughter will be dissapointed too when all the pieces are missing."
4,cinderella,well i got this toy a gift. i love how she looks and her dress but her wings fall off but if you hold them on her back they will stay. well over all i gave barbie or oddete 4 stars
4,No complaints here,"This is my 3 year olds first Barbie, so of course she HAD to have Barbie of Swan Lake. She loves it! Yes the wings fall off but I have no problems putting them on when she wants Barbie to fly or dance. I'm actually glad they're removable because if they were permanent, I'm sure they would have been broken off by now!"
3,Beautiful Barbie as Odette Wings Horrible,"The Swan Lake Barbie as Odette is a beautiful doll, except her wings really don't stay on. The light is cool, but does not stay on. have to hold it. They should come up with something to help it.But she is very pretty."
3,Barbie as Odette,My granny bought me this Barbie for my Birthday and within the first few moments of playing with my doll my mum noticed that her wings kept on falling off.in the end my mum put an elastic band around her waist to keep her wings on.my dad was moaning on about the amount of glitter that came off her dress and landed all over the living room carpet but thanks granny anyway for my barbie cause i just love all my barbie dolls.
2,The wings ruin this toy,"Barbie is lovely, as Barbies go (I am NOT a fan of Ms. Thang), but Barbie as Odette was my 5 year old's hearts desire for Christmas (...) so Santa delivered this doll. She is very pretty, and has a beautiful dress, but those wings ruin the toy. My daughter got very frustrated with it until we rigged up the wings so they stay put. Unfortunately, Barbie now has green covered wire all over her torso ... but at least the wings stay on.If you must buy a Barbie, get a different one."
3,Beautiful......but those darn wings!!!,"This is a beautiful barbie, but her wings will not stay on!! My daughter likes to have them on and light them up--a beautiful glow!! But you have to hold them on, they don't snap into her. And the little switch to make them ""fly"" or go up and down is too difficult for my 5 yr old to work by herself...It's too stiff. This is a lovely barbie, but not meant to be played with unless you take the wings off."
2,She's pretty but too glitery....,"I love this doll,but i keep her in my doll house afraid if i play with her...i will get gliter all over my hands and break her. she needs a more durable dress.overall she makes a great show doll!"
4,Wonderful toy but wings are a problem,"I bought this for my daugther for Christmas last year and she loves it so much but the wings fall out a lot, and also they can break off, the little pegs that go inside can snap off, it didn't happen to her doll but it did to a friends. This is a beautiful doll and a lot of fun but be careful with the wings!"
1,Wings didn't light up and crown broke in half.,"After one day of gently use, the doll's wings stopped lighting up and the crown broke in half. The necklace kept falling off and the shoes wouldn't stay on either. When I contacted Mattel to see if they'd replace the crown or the wings that clip on, they said they could not. I feel like I've been robbed of the $20.00 I spent to get this toy for my daughter. It was definately NOT money well spent."
3,Hee Haw,"I bought it for my step father, and it didn't work on his dvd player. I thought it was bad, but after I brought it to my house, and played it on my dvd player, it worked. His dvd player is fairly new too. I'm not sure about the quallity of the dvd's."
3,Hee Haw Purchase,"The 5 discs are of course perfect. In that I haven't had time to view them all,I imay not be giving a fair assesment. The episodes that I did see, seemed not to be up to par. This could be the show would improve itself in later appearances. . I always loved Hee Haw at the time of their original TV showings. My purchase may yet to be a prized possession."
2,Lord Haw Haw?,"Hee Haw was a TV phenomenon which made it a favorite in the South amd Midwest. The show combined humor, music, and pretty women, emulating laugh=in but adding a touch of the Grand ole'Opry. Now, the women hold up over time, their beauty is timeless. The music holds up, if you were into country music(not for me, I am afraid). Then there was the humor. What appeared to be funny, at the time, doesn't work now, years later, without the flow of the program with those country songs and pretty women. The Canadian comedian from the CBC did a pretty funny bit of the country news, and who could forget Mr. Samples and his phone number BR 549. But, that was about it; the rest leaves you wanting to see more Misty Rowe and the other girls and less cornfield humor...well, we're thru playing now..."
1,Can they place the bar any lower?,I have to believe that this show was the cynical product of some coastal elites who believed that everyone who lived in the fly over states had an IQ of 60. How else to explain this anti-humor with these freaks and geeks desperately trying to read their lines off of cue cards? A horrid show.
1,Disappointing,"I bought this book a couple of years ago now. Although it has some interesting discussion of distributed algorithms its big let-down is the abysmal Java code that it contains. I cannot believe for one moment that any of this compiles, let alone works - it all generally looks like pseduo-code written for the purposes of illustration rather being of any practical value.Likewise I didn't find the material particularly helpfully structured or consistent in its level of detail. I would have liked to see more quantitive analysis of the suitability of different algorithms in practical applications and broader coverage of well-known distributed algorithms (for instance paxos and virtual synchrony are conspicuous in their absence)."
3,A beginning step into the world of distributed algorithms,"I bought this book because I was interested in implementingdistributed algorithms. It has a good overview of the fundamentalalgorithms and I found it helpful to see actual code. It's the onlybook I know of that actually provides implementations rather thanpseudo code.On the other hand, the algorithm descriptions were often condensed, and Iexpected a more formal approach. I often found myself reading eagerlyto learn about an interesting variant of an algorithm only to find areference to a journal paper. It would be useful to cover a few morevariants more deeply.Also, I was hoping to get an idea of an algorithm's usefulness andperformance in practice. Or is a particular algorithm more oftheoretical interest? The answer was not clear to me, although infairness, this was not the author's main purpose."
5,Best practical book for distributed systems (that I could find),"I got this book because I have been a fan of Garg's Elements of Distributed Computing ever since I first read it. Concurrent and Distributed Computing in Java seems to be really great buy. It has a very strong theoretical foundation, but the emphasis seems to be on writing distributed programs and getting them to work. If you are a theory lover I wouldnt recommend ths book, but if you like implementing stuff then you will definitely like this book. The range of topics covered is quite comprehensive given the size of the book."
5,Valmiki's Revenge?,"Other reviewers have already pointed out that this is not a faithful rendering of the Ramayana. Yes, a different title could be less misleading and more considerate. Readers who are new to the Ramayana and want a readable English version might consider William Buck's retelling. Menen's book is something of an extended insiders' joke, or a long, pointed commentary on many of the absurdities of Hindu traditions and customs. This is NOT a book for children or for people who are new to Hinduism. Menen is a satirist, that is to say, a social critic, and biting satire is what he delivers here. If you already know the story of the Ramayana, you may benefit greatly from Menen's barbed observations. I certainly did."
1,This is not at all true to Valmiki's Ramayana,If you are looking for the real Ramayana - look elsewhere. Menen has taken great liberties - cherry picking parts of the original Ramayana. This version does not in any way reflect the deeper message that is hidden within the Ramayana. Menen should have titled his work more appropriately to reflect this given that the Ramayana is one of the most important books for 1/6 of the world's population...!!!!
4,A Good Introductory Book on World Religions,"This is a great introductory text on the major religions of the world. It is written in clear, understandable manner with many excellent photos. While it does not go into any great depth on any one religion, it makes an easy way to grasp the fundamentals of many religions in an interesting manner."
2,It's a picture book,"If you're looking for information on ideology, this is not the book for you. This book mainly covers each major religion's art, statues, jewelry, clothing, places of worship, etc.. along with their associated symbolism. It's mostly illustrated and steers clear of religous beliefs."
4,lots to look at,"This book has a lot of information about a lot of different world religions. There is plenty to look at, with a primary image on most pages surrounded by smaller images all with captions. Not a whole lot of text when it comes to regular paragraphs. A lot of the text is in the captions of the pictures. These can be hard to read at times because of the smaller print but overall the book is great for learning about other religious traditions."
4,"Reasonably unbiased, beautiful printing","Do not expect great depth from this book, but if you are looking to have an overview of the great faiths of the past and present, this book is for you. The artwork is beautiful, printed in high quality paper. I would have wished it included a chapter or two on neo pagan religions, but you can't have it all.A common failing of short works of comparative religion is the bias towards Christianity and monotheism in general. This book comes out reasonably well in this area. The exposition on Islam is mainly western, but makes a reasonable attempt at being non judgmental. I would have avoided the references to ""terrorism"".Both the ""Ancient Religions"" and ""Native Religions"" chapters deal with what is now called paleo paganism, and in my view are too short and superficial.The religious timeline is very helpful if you are new to the study of religions."
3,Nice pictures,It had nice pictures and a lot of information about different religions (as the name suggests). The amount of religions though is kind of over whelming. I would have like for them to concentrate on just say 10 different religions.
3,"Good, but Uneven With Internal Divisions","I agree much with what previous review Tevis wrote. However, the 5th printing of the 1st US edition does not seem to have the twin towers and gun-toter he mentioned. Maybe they pulled it.However, I noticed that the author was very uneven noting different sects and churches within each religion. He spends a whole section on it for Judaism, a paragraph or two with Sunni / Shia, had a whole section on the Orthodox church, some on the Roman Catholic church, and left the various protestant groups to a line or two, with no mention of Mormonism.I don't expect a section for each denomination, but a section on Protestantism would have been good, and maybe a section of various modern US religions, and include Mormonism.So, for odd unevenness of coverage, I give it a 4, but for omission of obvious groups worldwide groups such as Mormons and Wicca it gets a 3."
4,World Religions,"Like most prolific readers, I have several books going at the same time; subject book is one of them. Although I have yet to finish reading it, I can say with conviction that it is well worth the reading.Most of us have a general idea about most religions. This book provides important specificity enabling one to better see the differences as well as the similarities in the great religions of the world. It will make a great reference book for me as I continue my quest to better understand Christianity, its roots and how it correlates to other religions it seems to be at war with much of the time."
4,Beautiful,I sent this to my boyfriend and haven't seen it myself. He's read it many times and says the photos are gorgeous. He liked it so much he gave it to a friend and had me get him another one. Great starting reference for world religions.
2,5-star pictures and 1-star text,"This is a beautifully produced book with magnificent colored pictures. In many ways, I think it would be better without the text. The history, basic beliefs, and traditions of each religion are not presented in a concise or coherent manner. I would be unable to give anyone a succinct summary of any of the religions discussed by relying on this book alone. None of the subject religions seem to be treated seriously, and they all come off as a bit silly. Perhaps the silliness of organized religion can't be hidden behind words, but other books have done a better job of obfuscating that fact."
3,Objective???,The author writes from religious bias... It would be nice to see a book on religions that is objective...
4,Religion,"This is a geat simple overview of the major religions, if one wants more information, then they can go on from this."
3,It's okay,Not a very good read. It gets into too much detail then jumps to another religion. I was left not quite understanding the one we just left.
1,Next to worthless,"We bought this for our two-year old to help her learn some Chinese before taking a trip to China to visit her relatives. We were incredibly disappointed by the lack of content on the DVD. During the entire 30 minute video, the viewer only learns about 10 Chinese words: the numbers one through five, and a few fruits. Naturally, there's a lot of repetition in order to fill up that 30 minutes, so much so that by the end of the video my toddler was bored. We haven't watched it again after that initial viewing.Luckily, we had boughtPlay & Learn CHINESE with Mei Mei Vol. 2at the same time as this video, and our toddler liked that one much better."
4,Learn Italian book review from Amazon,Using this as a textbook and it fits the bill perfectly. Only weakness is the dictionary does not have all the words used in the book.
5,Foundation of a language,"Best way to learn a language. It builds the foundation. You start with the basics of verbs, nouns and pronouns."
3,Italian,I really like the book. I am not finished yet. I only wish the CD were available so I could practice the pronunciation and listen to it while commuting.
1,where's my cd?,I have always had great luck buying things on Amazon. I'm extremely disappointed in this last purchase however. I ordered the Learn Italian the Fast & Fun Way with the CD's for a class I'm taking. When it arrived the book was not in very good shape and one of the CD's is missing...the first CD to be exact which at this point in my class is the most important CD. I emailed the person that sent me the books and never received a response from her. I strong recommend thinking twice before you purchase something from this seller.
3,useful but limited,"The audio CD's are a good complement to the text. But for a 288 page book, you think they could teach you more than the present tense! Ok, they teach the imperative (eg. command) tense, but that's it. Nothing about the simple past or future. Just listen to yourself talk for 5 minutes and think about how hard it is to keep it ALL in the present tense."
5,"very good resource, easy to use, highly recommend...","We've used a different CD based system for French & this book/CD set ""Learn Italian the Fast and Fun Way by Marcel Danesi & Barron's is FAR BETTER. It's simple to follow. I think the CD only systems are too difficult to follow & you need something in print that follows audio. This book is the coursework for a Italian class we're taking by a native of Italy & she said it's 99% correct."
2,"So close to being a good movie, but it missed!","Want to watch a depressing movie with a very unsatisfactory ending? If so, this movie is for you. It could have easily gone the other way, and been a really, really great movie. I don't want to spoil it, in case you do decide to watch it, so I can't say a lot. The characters are super depressing, emotionless, and I have no idea what on earth is going through anyone's head! And it ends that way, with me still being confused. Are the characters happy at the end? I think some of them are, but I have no idea why. It gets two stars because it's far from the worst movie I've ever seen. There are some interesting moments in the film, which I wish they had expanded on. Watch it at your own risk."
2,No Need To Over Intellectualize This One,"Boring movie about a spiritual zealot who obsesses over his daughter's photographic memory. He mistakenly believes she has a mystical connection to god. In the mean time he destroys relationships with everyone else in his family. Son and wife both have some serious mental issues and have taken his rhetoric to an absurd end. Like any story of addiction, the destruction is obvious to everyone but those addicted. Lame flick, but I give it two stars because Juliette Binoche is so sexy."
1,Horrible ending.,"I thought the movie was very good but was horrified by the obtuseness of the sub-plot involving Miriam, and left struck empty by the abruptness of the ending. Actors' performances were well-wrought, but I can't recommend the film for anything other than a rainy saturday. You will want to see another movie right after to feel like you've seen a real story."
3,I will NEVER watch another Richard Gere movie!,"Maybe I hated the father more because it was Richard Gere, so he might have done the job well, after all.Flora Cross is amazing. The son and mother were also very convincing.It was just an odd movie.SPOILER ALERT!!! DO NOT READ BELOW IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED THE MOVIE!At the Nationals, do you think Eliza did that to ruin her dad's day?"
1,I want my life back!,I lost (it seemed like) three hours of my life.I'd rather have been waterboarded than watch that garbage.
4,Spellbinding Film.,"I was drawn to this movie because of the title, Bee Season. Little did I know that this movie had little to do with bees or spelling. It was more about a family's struggle to connect with God and each other.The cinematography was amazing, with the words swirling around trying to fit together like the pieces of a puzzle or the origami bird that formed perfect letters to spell its namesake.From the other reviews that I have read, maybe I should have read the book first. It would have given me a better insight on the characters thoughts and feeling.Overall, it was a spellbinding film, pardon the pun."
3,A solid intelligent film,"A dysfunctional family is glue together yet pulled apart by the success of it's youngest member who has progressed all the way to the National spelling B championship. Aided by her her fathers' guidance via his religious teachings and mystical imputs she takes her gift for words and knowledge to the limits of human expression, culminatinating in a moment where I can only believe she attained the heights of her first orgasm.Her mother has meanwhile fallen into the pit of depression and her dad - played by Richard Gere - seeks comfort in her spelling B achievements and uses this as an escape mechanism to distance himself from his crumbling family unit.The ending well..........you have to see it for yourself"
1,The California Formula,"Hey! Another dysfunctional california family...what a surprise! They just wrapped in a thin veil of religion. This was not a good or inventive movie. It's another dis-jointed, multi-line movie with unlikeable characters. I can go with likeable characters and a sad ending, or likeable charaters and a happy ending. But to sit through 2 hours of annoying people with a happy ending...who cares? I'm not sure if the girl's character was a case of bad casting or bad direction.The story with the mother was also frustrating, since we couldn't tell what was happening. Was she having memory flashbacks or psychic visions? Did she know the people who owned the houses or were they random? Was Saul cheating on her or was this related to her parents death? Sure we figured it out, but the actual story turned out to not be as interesting as what we were speculating.The oldie Grand Canyon was a better movie of the same type. At least there weren't any toads falling from the sky at the end."
4,Una pelicula sobre la espiritualidad,"4 personajes buscando su propio acercamiento a Dios a través de diferentes caminos, no siempre los mismos a pesar de ser de la misma familia.Es una película un poco lenta, pero interesante. El personaje de la madre logra capturar la atención y la tensión hasta el final y evita que la película se haga larga para el espectador.Muy buena!"
1,Depressing,"This is a depressing and confusing movie. Nothing like what I thought it would be from the DVD cover! It was painful to watch such morose children. The dad was villified although it seemed to me that he was guilty of nothing more than being annoying. What kept me watching was wondering what the mom was up to, but that turned out to be so weird it was beyond my understanding. And what was the deal with Eliza on the floor in the hotel room? A spiritual experience? Not a movie to recommend at all."
1,this movie is awful,"I spent most of this movie trying to figure out what was going on with the mother/wife character. I spent far too long watching this odd, dream-like movie and having absolutely no idea what was really happening. I still don;t know what happened. The sequences involving the mother are filmed in short, disconnected pieces so you can never tell what the heck she was doing. Somehow her odd behavior was linked to his religion - maybe - and maybe had something to do with her parents death?? - I still have no idea. Wha a waste of time."
2,Not what it seemed...,"My father picked this movie up for us at Blockbuster, and from what he saw on the cover, it seemed okay. But, what we didn't know was that the movie was more about religion than spelling, which made us not very happy because we're not very religious people. The back cover on the movie case is VERY misleading. The only part that I liked in the movie was how the little girl could spell words!"
1,Please read the book instead.,"The book that this movie is based on is truly amazing. The characters are complex and maladjusted and we get intensive insight into each of their minds as they struggle to interact. In the movie however, there is none of this. This was is absolutely painful to watch, knowing the greatness that the book contains and seeing the true soul of the story sliced out and discarded! For example, Aaron's storyline has been altered so that it has lost all internal spiritually contemplative meaning by making Chali some girl that he flirts with and even comes home to meet the parents?? Come on. So much has been changed that it is absolutely ridiculous. There is no way that this movie could have encompassed Myla Goldberg's vision."
3,Just ok,Good but at cheap price. But it starts to hurt the ears after a while. Could have used a softer rubber material on the end of the arms.
2,Didn't fit right,We ended up returning these... they just felt strange and didn't fit quite right. Return policy was easy peasy though.
1,Very Disappointing,"I have read quite a few first time authors - this book, In His Eyes, was by far one of the worst I've read, particularly at the price of $17.50. As the other reviews indicated, the book was full of typos, grammatical errors, dis-jointed and incomplete sentences. Miss Crutcher needs to go back to the drawing board."
2,Disappointed...,"It was an okay read. There was a lot of potential here. I am hoping that there will be a sequel because the mother's story is definitely intriguing and I want to know what happens with her. The premise of this story is good but both the main characters were sappy. We can't be together, we can be together. Get over it already, yeash..."
1,This book had no romace,"I was so disappointed with this book.I just don't understand all the 5 star reviews this book got they really steered me wrong.Where was the romance???? The hero was a simpleton and the heroine fell in TSTL territory .This book was stupid stupid stupid. I could not believe the first love scene YUCK!What a total waste of time. There was also no story. I simply cannot believe this was written by J Lindsay. Another problem, all the uncles just a set up for future books. Well this was so pathetic that I will be reading no more of this series. This was Mills and Boon quality stuff (which I stopped reading at age 15)not worth the money I paid."
3,Enjoyable romance novel.,"Nicholas kidnaps Reggie by mistake, thinking she is someone else. As a result, her brothers force a marriage even though nothing happened. Nicholas didn't commmunicate well with Reggie about his being a bastard. He thinks she won't want to be married to him, so he leaves for the W. Indies for 6 months. Not a good story line, but I did like the way Reggie put down evil Miriam.Sexual content not evaluated. I read this book before I began counting sex scenes and describing the language. As I recall, it was probably mild. Setting: 1817 London. Copyright: 1985. Genre: regency romance.For a list of my reviews of other Johanna Lindsey books, see my 5 star review of ""Gentle Rogue"" posted 6/14/08."
5,"A steamy tale of love, desire, entrancement and clashing wills.","Love Only Once: A Malory Novel is the unabridged audiobook presentation of bestselling author Johanna Lindsey's passionate romance novel. Regina Ashton, niece to Lord Edward and Lady Charlotte Malory and blessed with her family line's sumptuous beauty, has been abducted by the handsome, golden-haired rogue Nicholas Eden. Enraged by her kidnapping, yet also inflamed with passion for Nicholas, Regina's determination to make him pay with his heart and wed her - yet Nicholas' willingness to love has been hurt by a painful hidden secret in his past. A steamy tale of love, desire, entrancement and clashing wills. 7 CDs, 8 hours."
5,I LOVE THE MALLORY'S,I love all of the Malory books! This was set me on a course of falling in love over and over agin with the entire family! The Mallory's come to life and keep you laughing and turning the page. You can't wait to get to the next and hate for the book to end. If you read one Mallory book you have to read them all! Each and every one is a keeper. Don't miss any of them.
3,Not What I Remembered,"Malory Book #1: This novel was certainly not what I remembered it to be when I first read it in the eighties, and it doesn't stand up to the test of time the way ""Tender Rebel"" and ""Gentle Rogue"" do. I have always loved Regina's character, and this being her book was what made it enjoyable. However, I really didn't care for Nicholas at all, nor the storyline. It was lacking in so many aspects...a loose story, an unconvincing love, and characters that weren't developed well enough. In fact, you get to know and like Regina more throughout the next few books in the series than you do here which is odd. That being said, if you are looking to read the Malory series, you really should start with this title. You will like the books more and more as you read on..."
3,wheres the love?,it was not as good as Gentle Rogue. to me Nicky was not romantic as James. most of the time nicky was not there for ragina
2,Not that good,"I have read 2 books of JL and that was the reason why I bought more books of her, she is a very talented author and has mastered her craft. But this book is quite disappointing. I don't agree with women being so martyr and Regina has been a martyr bride up to the end. How I wished she at least made Nicholas suffered more for what he did to her and not been so forgiving as if he's the only man on earth! But ofcourse, a couple united by God, should not be separated by any man or any circumstance for that matter. Still it's not a thrilling love story."
4,Love Only Once,The way that these two characters come together is really pretty original. Accidental kidnapping that ends up with Regina's reputation being ruined is really quite unique. Regina's determination to get what she wanted and Nicholas's cold feet were a great combination. Great secondary characters with wonderful chemistry.
5,Loved it!,"This one was just too good. Out of all of the hunks in the Malory series, I must say that Nicholas Eden is the sexiest one (James is a close second). And Regina Ashton is so likable. This story has a really hot plot. I could read this one over and over again."
2,"Good story, but the audio cassette is disappointing!","This is the first in the Malory series and I'm reviewing the audio cassette, the story itself s very good but the audio cassette version is very disappointing and boring because the American reader did not use English accents and she didn't even bother to use different voice sounds for each character! Love Only Once is about a young lady named Regina Ashton who by mistaken identity is abducted by Nicholas Eden who mistook her for his mistress and winds up tarnishing Regina's reputation which infuriates Reggie's very protective uncles the wealthy and powerful Malory brothers who later appear in their own stories in this series. I rate this 2 stars beause of the reader's lack of English accents and not making her voice sound different for all the different characters! The audio cassette is abridged and I really hope they rerecord it unabridged and with the proper accents and interesting changes of voice sounds!"
4,Great!,This is the first of the Mallory books and it is spendid! And by the way the heroine is named Regina (Reggie) not Regan! I like Regina and also Nicholas and really felt bad Nicholas with how badly he was treated by his family! Great book. I recommend it!
5,Love Only Once got me hooked!,"This was the first Johanna Lindsey book i've read and now it's got me hook on her books for good! I love the Malory family - they kept me smiling,and even laughing out loud while reading the books."
1,unbelieveable,"This book was very disappointing. I have read other books by this author and they have been passable, but this particular book was awful. The story is that a girl desperately wants a husband, so she has her uncles force a man (who doesn't want her) into marriage. After he reluctantly marries her, he dumps her off with his step mother and leaves the country. When the girl's uncles drag him back to England, he finds her pregnant, but accuses her of infidelity and denies that the child could be his. How could anyone find this romantic? In the last 5 or 10 pages of the book the guy admits that he simply wished to protect the girl from being his wife because he is a bastard, and then she easily forgives him for all of his sins. Whatever."
5,DEVILISHLY EXCITING!!! I'VE READ THE WHOLE MALORY SERIES!,"I rather enjoyed the love affair between Reggie and Nicholas, she can manipulate anyone with her witty charm. I also felt a warm and loyal connection with the Malory family. Reggie's uncles were all rather exciting, especially James and Anthony! If only families were that close today. I can't wait for a new Malory novel on someone like Jeremy..."
3,long suffering heroine and mean hero,"I plan to read more Mallorey books (I really liked the Gentle Rogue,) but I have to admit I found this one frustrating. I hate that the hero is so darn mean the whole time to the heroine. He was just aweful up to the end. Dumping her after the wedding, ""taking her innocence"" but not wanting to marry her and on and on . . . I like when there is tension, and misunderstanding BUT lots of love and passion laced through, and when both sides of the story seem reasonable. Nicholas just was so self centered and cad-like the whole time. I wanted to shake Regina and tell her to go home to Uncle Tony and let him take care of her! There was not enough pleasure to make up for the torment!!"
4,Great value,This exercise pen is a good value. The walk through door is GREAT. No more trying to unhook several clasps to get your dog out. They are lightweight but not as strong as others I have bought without the door. They are a great price too. I have bought three and will stick with this style.
3,Not really for Maya 4.5,"This book is pretty much what you would expect. It is a series of Maya tutorials which cover the essentials modeling , dynamics, etc. It has some pretty good quality color pictures as well which is always a plus. It even comes with a disc which includes Maya PLE 4.5 which is nice. The problem with the book is there are none of the new 4.5 features included ! This book doesn't include anything about, fluid effects, ramp shaders, the new align and snap together tool or anything with transform marking menus. I feel this is Maya 4 only"
1,Glorified TimeCube,"A self-proclaimed genius delivers babble disguised as philosophy.This 'book' is more like a glorified TimeCube (TimeCube.com), another crackpot theory.Recommended for its hilarity."
2,Terrible book,If you are looking to learn to cartoon or draw caricatures then please avoid this book. The cartooning style is poor and the book just has the author chat about how good he is and why he drew this and why he drew that - no real instruction - just some guy explaining how good he is. If you are a Mike Petere fan then you may like it but if you are learning or studying caricature or cartoons there are some very good books on the market. I actually felt ripped off buying this book.
3,House of Regret,"The House on Brooke Street was a sad tale of love lost by uncertainty, or was it fright? A tale of homosexuality in the 1920's, the text is somtimes hard to track, as it is written in the form of journal entrys.The writer, a department store bookeeper, is sure of his sexual identity, sure of his infatuation with the man of his dreams, yet is crippled by the fear of being discovered in a gay relationship.I see many similar parables in modern society and those staid ways of the 20's, when often gays were processed as criminals or mental degenerates.The book is erotic and depressing, all at the same time, and takes extra time to absorb. If you want easy reading, you don't want this book. However, if you have the time to invest in a carefully written, detailed novelette, you will not be disappointed."
2,For beginners only,This book was a disappointment to me because the stencils are very simplistic and rather crude. Recommend only for beginning stencillers.
4,Perfect Fit !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This was exactly what I wanted fits perfectly without any modifications.I would recommend this companys parts to anyone, actually very close to OEM or better."
3,Fit and finish not like OEM,"Although they do work fine, they are shoddily made. Dried sealant all around the housing, I had to chip some off to make it fit properly. They don't quite line up on the lower mount point. I was able to make it work but I had to drill out the lower mounting tab on the headlight. It was off by about 1/4"". You will most definitely have to get your headlights adjusted unless you like blinding planes. Not a big deal."
5,"Still very, very good.","I purchased this in vinyl back in 1984, when I was learning to play viola. My English teacher, though, was the person who'd introduced it to me. My review comes with heavy sentimental value, but this album will forever remind me of a very bittersweet fall and winter in the southwest US. The pieces are flowing, the cellist is very very good at wringing emotion from the instrument, and the melodies just work extremely well. While this at times crosses into the realm of easy listening, there are dynamics that still work for an active listener; this isn't just background music. The album, as a whole, is stark at times, sad and lush at other times, and always moving.What I would recommend is finding Sandy Owen via google, and buying the music direct from the label. Much less expensive."
2,Addition to my last review,"One last thing to add, one reviewer Mr Glueck, further down belowthinks that todays anti Israel sentiments are connected to the nazi ideology then I would suggest further research on that subject. Most modern day antisemitism is caused by former communist propanganda and 1968 like students revolutionary grabage, an ideology that mostly tried to ""exterminate"" the Jewish FAITH and deny a state to the Jews, the state of Israel, but did NOT try to kill Jews physically.Also WHO IS MICHAEL MILKEN ??????"
4,A powerful and eye opening account,"I found Goldhagen's book really eye opening. Prior to reading it, I read for background The Anguish of the Jews: 23 Centuries of anti-seminitism. But nothing prepared me for this book. I was expecting a book on why the Holocaust happened, little did I realize how involved the German people were involved. Nor did I realize how little control the Nazi party and Government had on the people.I thought the book to be really interesting and well done."
5,Well worth reading if you ask me,"Goldhagen's book may be presented in a lot less than perfect writing style, but as an average sophomore student in H.S, I still found the book to be highly readable. The literary complications were worth going through to get to the (well at least for me) enlightening information on this subject. This book has satisfied my curiousity about how a tragedy like the holocaust could happen. Also,in no way did I interpret Goldhagen's views to be condemning or placing permanent guilt or blame on Germans or Germany as a whole, past or present. The book just gives an explanation on how so many people, ordinary people, could do such unordinary things."
1,Don't Waste Your Time and Money,"This is the worst book I have ever read. For one thing, it is very boring and poorly written. As far as the content is concerned, Goldhagen claims to be presenting new information, but he just regurgitates established facts and then twists them around to make them fit his interpretation, instead of making his interpretation fit the facts. I was also surprised to see that he used very few primary sources, which is a big no no when writing a scholarly work. In fact, scholars regard this book as so bad that a couple of them have gotten together and written a book about it. It is called _Goldhagen's Thesis_. Goldhagen has very little respect now in the historical community. There are plenty of well-written and informative books on the subject of the German people during the Nazi era (oral histories abound). Please read one of these credible books instead."
4,"Troubled work, but valuable","Goldhagen's work has many problems but is still a valuable study. His thesis that the Holocaust was the result of a specific kind of German ""elimanationist anti-Semitism"" is not supported by the evidence. It is repetitive and hard to read (after all it is a dissertation). However, it is valuable because it has helped re-focus the debate on the perpetrators, examines the death marches, and has led to a reevaluation of many of the positions taken by other historians. The various responses of the the critics that have been published alone make this book important, though they are generally scathing."
1,Don't waste your time - Disgraceful,"As an avid reader of WW2 history I found this book to be biased, flawed and almost unreadable. I am no racist or Holocaust denier, and what the Nazis did to the Jews, Slavs and other minority groups was absolutely terrible. However, if one wishes to read well researched historical facts about the people who were responsible then don't bother with ""Hitler's Willing Executioners"". If the publisher had any sense of reality or fact they would have laughed Goldhagen out of their office. I could go on, but it really isn't worth my time - don't waste yours on this book."
2,Prolix,"I rarely review anything on Amazon, but I was so taken aback by this ""landmark"" book that I felt something had to be said.I take issue not necessarily with the core thesis of the book, but the style in which it is written. Rarely, if ever, have I encountered a ""major work"" that is so overtly pedantic and densely unreadable as this. Apparently it had its genesis as an academic thesis and, dear god, does it show. I knew I was in trouble when the introduction - usually just a brief note about the book by the author or a third party - was some 25 pages long.The book could have made all of the same key points and arguments with far greater incisiveness and clarity in a volume half this size. And I say this about the absurdly drawn-out, repetitive language and style as someone who regards William Shirer's massive ""Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"" (1,000+ pages) as one of the great non-fiction books of all-time."
2,"Some Good Info, Poorly Written","This book has some good info on the police battalions, the work camps, and the death marches, but I have several problems with this book. First Goldhagen is a horrible writer. His style is boring and he seems to toss in big words just to prove he knows them. Second, although this book is supposed to be a new view on the Holocaust and ordinary Germans it really isn't. Most of the information in the book that is supposedly new can be found in many other books. Third, the main point of the book is spelled out in the first couple of pages, but Goldhagen keeps repeating it over and over and over again throughout the book. It really becomes annoying. Finally, all of these things combined makes this a pretty forgettable book. All in all the book has some decent moments, but is poorly written, parts are boring, and the information that is supposed to be new really isn't. There are much better books about ordinary Germans and the Holocaust out there than this one."
2,"An Interesting Subject, but Poorly Presented","I truly expected a lot of this book before purchasing it, but was disappointed with the book from both (1) a literary standoing and (2) a factual and reasoning standpoint. On the literary side, this book will put you to sleep since reading Goldhagen is like reading a very long and boring college psychology paper: it is not reader-friendly although there are certain portions that I admired that I thought stood out quite well. - As for Goldhagen's analysis of the feelings of the ""ordinary"" Germans, his analysis is weak and spotty because his hypothesis is weak or poorly stated or poorly chosen and his arguments appear ""forced"" to agree with this limited hypothesis. - I feel the subject is very important, but that the author disapointed me since he could have done a better job."
2,A book about racists by a racist,"I was hoping the book would dig into man's seemly inate ability to put others down. Wether it be German/Jew, Serbs/Muslims, Hutu/Tutsi or even Protestant/Catholic in Ireland many people can be drawn into hate. I believe the reasons the Holocaust came to be is it was the first time in modern history that a powerful and racist government came to world power for a long period of time. Yet even though the author said there were some examples of germans who tried to feed the Jews on the death marches and that many of the central Europeans who provided much of the labor to run the camps were very cruel. His basic premis is that Germans are a racist people who fostered their racist ideas for more than 100 years. I agree that the Holocaust was not hidden from the Germans and only a few knew about but I find it hard to believe there is something genetic or cultural about Germany that caused the Holocaust. By the way I am not German."
1,Collective Guilt Absurd,"Goldhagen espouses the absurd viewpoint of collective guilt (much like Levi Primo). The work is overstated and should be taken with a dose of Browning or another author grounded in historical fact. Book sure to stimulate conversation, which is good, but is also just as suredly going to mislead novices in holocaust studies who read this book only because of its noteriety"
2,Did Goldhagen really try find out how it happend?,"Sadly enough he missed that chance. Even though he delivers a lot of shocking and without doubt true information, anyone familiar with German history will find his stereotype perspective really annoying. It even seems that he does not try to explore the whole thing, but has a preset opinion which he wants to proof by leaving out all facts which would not support his idea that all Germans were just evil by nature. If you want a realistic look at the Holocaust, read Michael Burleigh's ""The Third Reich - A New History"". After that you will see that Goldhagen's book is nothing but a collection of horrible facts which fail to explain anything because they are not discussed academically."
1,"A pontificating, biased account","Unlike Goldhagen, I will be succinct. This work is a very boring read as the author writes in an academia style and not in simple prose. Additionally he reverts to the same idea over and over again - all Germans in the war were bigots and happily took part in the Holocaust. One of the most biased and unenlightening books I have read on the subject."
4,Yes.,Goldhagen brings to light what many of us knew to be true. Anti-semitism was (and still is) part of the German culture. Anyone who disputes this is clearly an idiot. Many Germans went along with Hitler because they were brougt up thinking that Jews must be exterminated. Given the opportunity to actually go ahead and actually commit genocide many gladly volunteered to work the camps
1,Anti-German Diatribe,"This is one of the poorest books I have read in a long time, both in terms of content and style. Although the book is supposed to be an objective evaluation, it contains virtually nothing objective about ordinary Germans. Goldenhagen lays out an unconvincing premise of a particularly virulent form of anti-Semitism in Germany. He the uses a series of anecdotes as ""proof"" of his points. ""Academic"" writing often is stylistically wanting, and this book is no exception. Goldenhagen repeats the same points over and over again, as it repetition makes them true. This book contributes little or nothing to the understanding of the Holocaust."
1,Distasteful,The main premis of this book has been completely discredited by any number of authorities on all sides. It is therefore nothing more than hate literature and should be treated as such.
3,Offers nothing new,"Do Germans need to keep being reminded of their tacit approval of the Holocaust? Let's not kick a man when he's already down. I think most Germans realize what they've done and they're trying to put it behind them. As Hans Frank, governor-general of Poland, said before his execution at Nuremberg: ""A thousand years will pass and the guilt of Germany still won't be erased."""
1,"What about the Klee book, published in 1988?","This book is claimed to be groundbreaking research, but what about the German book about the same subject that was published in 1988? ""Schöne Zeiten"": Judenmord aus der Sicht der Täter und Gaffer"" in English ""'The Good Old Times': The Murder of the Jews as Seen by the Perpetrators and Onlookers"" by Klee, Dressen and Riess. Seems that the ground was broken almost 10 years before this book was published. But the Klee book adds no commentary; it simply presents the documents and lets them speak for themselves. That seems more important to me than drawing conclusions. Well, if I understand Goldhagen's method correctly, drawing documents from a conclusion already drawn. Just a thought."
1,Nothing has been learned from the Holocaust.,"It is wrong to condemn people based on membership in an ethnic group. The idea of guilt by ethnicity, which led to the Holocaust, is aggresively propogated in this book. The irony is astonishing.A better subtitle would have been ""Ordinary People and the Holocaust""."
2,A seriously flawed treatment of the Holocaust.,"Although Goldhagen certainly did plenty of research, his argument is certainly *not* a new one: it was, in fact, a central point in the German ""historians' conflict"" which, though still unresolved, raged in the mid-1980s. Furthermore, Goldhagen commits a social science cardinal sin: his argument is completely circular. He uses his dependent variable (the murderous acts of Holocaust participants) to prove his independent variable (eliminationist anti-semitism). Lastly, the first customer comment COMPLETELY misses the entire point Goldhagen is trying to make. His claim is that Germans were active and eager participants and were not passive by any definition of the word"
1,History Gone Awry,"Yet another book about an overworked topic, this time arriving at the hate-filled conclusion of every German being guilty of the Holocaust. This book is not written by a historian. It is a biased attempt to revive past prejudices against the German people. Most people already know the author has an agenda, and only the press praises the book. The people, after having paid the exorbitant price and read the book, are too intelligent to believe the fairytale-like conclusions drawn by the author"
2,Everything wrong with academic writing,"My comments deal only with Goldhagen's skills as a writer, which are conspicuously absent. His book cries out for a good editor, who would have toned down the academic puffery, pretentious jargon in place of resonant language. He takes a topic of exceptional importance and kills it for readers outside the academy (and, contrary to what many may think, even those in the academy prefer lucid, compelling, non-redundant prose).Perhaps the person who told Goldhagen to publish his dissertation should have mentioned that rewriting would be involved."
2,Does not convince,"First of all I got the impression that Goldhagen had made his conclusion before he ever started researching this book. Then he tells us that anti-semitism is the reason for the holocaust... (?) ...was there ever any doubt?!. Although he makes good the point that ordinary Germans participated willingly in the Holocaust, his blanket condemnation of Germans falls way short for the resons that other reviewers have pointed out. For all the hoopla the book has caused, it ends up unconvincing. Unfortunately for humanity, cruelty and barbarism are not an exclusive trait of Germans."
2,An Ax to Grind - Unreadable & Jargonistic,"I originally bought this book with the naive understanding that I would come to greater understanding of this enormous human tragedy. Instead I found myself plodding through (as I read it) Mr. Goldhagen's personal quest to demonize an entire people as intrinsically evil with a predispositon to perpretrate this crime. Mr. Goldhagens language was also a barrier, as he seems to have taken great pains to incorporate jargonisitc language at every possible juncture - Being a Harvard student I guess this isn't surprising - He must have scored 800 on his SAT Verbal and wants everyone to know it. Hardly a must read on the Holocaust - Its nothing more than personal venom with a catchy title masquerading in highly ""academic"" language."
1,Putative,"This was a student thesis that achieved media stardom. The main point - German knowledge/particpation in the `final solution' was far more widespread was valid. But hardly surprising (given the number of victims).The work does little or nothing to analyze how `normal' people did the most vile things essential in the program. For that, read Browning's `Ordinary Men;' Sereny `Into That Darkness;' Rhodes `Masters of Death.' For the events themselves, there are far better sources (Babi Yar, Hilberg, etc).Though respecting the author's premise, the work is shoddy, poorly written, and shallow. The subject deserves much more effort. `Putative' is used so many times in the text it must have been the author's favorite thesaurus discovery."
2,Great Thesis but UnReadable Book,"The main point in Hitler's Willing Executioners is a good one. Personally, I tend to believe, I can see why others don't but the bottom line is that it is a thesis that though simple is a strong possibility. The idea that the German people themselves were anti-semtic and the role this played in the Holocaust and the ability for Hitler to do what he did is something I agree with. However, this book is unreadable. The vocabulary, the word choices...its impossible to read. I suggest reading Explaing Hitler and the Chapter on this book."
4,Why all the fuss?,"When ""Hitler's Willing Executioners..."" was first published in 1996 it created a firestorm of controversy. Germans generally argued they had been unwilling participants or unknowing bystanders in the execution of the Holocaust.The author contends that anti-Semitism was rampant in Germany and that Hitler merely tapped into enormously popular public sentiment. The argument is historically justifiable and makes perfect sense. Hitler's extreme anti-Semitism did not appear out of thin air. Anti-Semitism had been fostered in German society for centuries.Understandably, it's much more comfortable for Germans to view themselves as unwilling conscripts than eager accomplices of the Nazis but Goldhagen offers a large amount of examples to prove otherwise.After you read the book you'll wonder what all the fuss was about?"
4,Hitler's Willing Executioners,"This book is one of the first books that I have read about the Holocaust. Though Daniel Goldhagen was ridiculed by the German population, I really believed in some of the things he had to say. I really did not have much prior historical knowledge of many of the events in this book. When I was done reading it, with a little explaining from my teacher, I really understood this book. I thought that it was very well written, even though there were some complicated and slow places. It showed me that Dr. Goldhagen felt quite passionate about his position. Some of his views were qutie radical, and were understandibly insulting to the German people. I did enjoy this book, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in this area"
2,"His ""causal"" argument is nonsense","I read this book most of the way through, was troubled by the author's approach but was getting some useful tid bits here and there. About page 419 in the paper back though, I ran into his explication of his causal reasoning, (a subject of study I am intimately and professionally familiar with) and it was complete jibberish, its as if a comedian were pretending to speak chinese by reciting a bunch of menu items from the corner noodle shop. Given this level lazy ignorance, I simply let the book drop, most of his previous, already less than convincing, arguments were cast in a much harsher light. This is too bad, some of the info seemed genuinely useful."
4,"A must read for those who think ""it can't happen here""","This book addresses the sociological and psychological phenomena in which ""ordinary"" citizens act pathological, and goes far to illuminate the hidden truths of human society.While focusing on the Nazi era, this book does an outstanding job of elucidating the underlying pathology of humans in groups.This book is well worth the time and money invested."
1,Extremely well written racist propoganda,"If this were written for any other culture people would be more up in arms. But since we are so open to painting all Germans as evil inhuman creatures, than books like this exist with very little to no opposition. To say that every German (think of that,not some, not many, EVERY GERMAN) was a willing participant to the Holocaust is an ignorant statement. It's as bad as stating that every Jew is responsible for the death of Jesus of Nazareth. It's thinking like this that has to stop. Racism with a doctorate, is still racism. In a day where anti-semetic behavior is immeditely caught and snuffed out. We should also be as watchful towards behavior against any other race, nationality, or religion."
1,Horrible Book,This book was horrible! I have never read anything so wrong in !my life! How can you write something like this!
2,Formidable research. Deeply flawed conclusions.,"I genuinely wanted to like this book. However, the arguments put forward are so deeply biased by Goldhagen's strong views on the subject as to be worth little in granting the reader greater understanding of the Holocaust. It doesn't read like a history book and I wasn't surprised to learn (afterword) that the author is not a historian.That said, there is value in reading it. The book is rich in facts and detail, the result of some indepth research.However, the way the author uses (and abuses) these facts left me wanting to stop reading in frustration. The book is filled with 'Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc' arguments and mental gymnastics designed to prove Goldhagen's hypothesis.Millions of non-Jewish victims are for the most part ignored in this work, but it still can be worth a read. But, only if you are not put off by reptitive, awkward prose and are prepared to seperate the rich collection of data from the author's emotionally driven interpretations."
1,"Good idea, poor execution","Please note: I am compulsive about reading every word in every book I own. However, I could not finish this book for two reasons:1. The author is difficult to read and he appears to be more interested in impressing his doctorial professors than in clarifying an important subject. Frequently he constructs sentences with 75 to 100 words, sentences that take up an entire page on Kindle. He confused verbosity with intelligence.2. But more importantly, he never explained or even properly explored why the Germans were willing executions of the Jews. Why was the attitude towards Jews so different in Denmark, France and England? Or why were the Poles so willing partners in murdering Jews?If you want details of German brutality disguised in pedantic language, read this book. If you want to understand why average Germans were willing killers... look elsewhere."
3,Goldhagen's Point,"Some people seem to think that Daniel Goldhagen is arguing that all ordinary Germans were willing murderers. That's not what he's saying at all. What he's saying is that the vast majority of the willing murderers were ordinary Germans. There is a subtle, yet profound, difference between the two concepts. I think he also largely proves his point.Other than that, it's heavy, densely written, & because it was a doctoral thesis, quite repetitious. Once you get beyond those flaws, you'll find it is grimness to the nth degree. It is not an easy read, nor is it especially enjoyable. It is, however, important."
1,PATHETIC!!,"I read many books on World War 2 and the Holocaust in three different languages. This book is one of the worst. It targets only the Germans. What about the rest of Europe! What about all the volunteers from France, Holland, Norway and eastern european countries that joined the SS!What about the Soviet Union. Millions of German soldiers disappeared in concentration camps in Siberia.I you want a better more objective account on what went on, I recommend the author Janusz Piekalkiewicz."
2,A great idea for an awful book.,"The role of ""ordinary Germans"" in the Holocaust is not as original a topic as Goldhagen would have readers believe, but it's certainly rich and interesting material. Goldhagen's bloated and obtuse prose is inexcusable, however. With careful editing, this could have been an interesting book."
1,unreadable,"this guy definitely makes an important point: that the germans were antisemites for 100 years before hitler, and wanted to kill the jews for 50 years before. i really wanted to get through it, but his writing style is unreadable. he insists on painstakingly defining every simple term he uses and the result is such slow going that one loses the thread of his argument, the momentuum just sags and falls. i gave up after 150 pages that should have been 30. the last straw was a para that definied 'ideals', 'intentions', and 'policies' and demonstrated in what order they usually occur, followed by another one that essentially said that the solutions to the 'jewish problem' resulted from trying to solve the 'jewish problem'. ive never thrown a book away but his one might kick it off."
1,Couldn't Prove his Case,"This book should not be on any Holocaust scholar's list of books to read. He goes too far in claiming that the Holocaust occurred because all Germans are evil and were eager to kill people. While he uses information which disproves his case, he fails to account for why it disproves his case; in other words, he uses the information anyway, even extremely out of context. If you want a better work on perpetrator behavior, check out Christopher Browning. Leave this one off the list."
1,One of the worst scholarly books ever written,"I don't even have to give you my opinion. Goldhagen shows what a biased, vengeful and spiteful person he is with his flawed research and undocumented claims. This book is the reason why you should start checking the footnotes if you didn't before. You cannot take people's research for granted. Example: p. 166 footnote #13. Read that one in the back. He didn't have time to actually calculate how many people were actually perpetrators, he simply believes the number was gigantic! He says that word for word! HA! There are DOZENS of ""facts"" like this. Other whoppers: p. 339. Goldhagen here actually creates his own German fantasy about how Germans made love next to concentration camps and how disgusting that is, yet it is completely without proof and later turns out to be his own fictional description that he hopes will convince you of how terrible Germans are. I am not even German and I was offended."
1,tough read,"This is a really difficult read, not because of the material itself, but because of the way in which it is written. At least when reading textbook accounts of this period in history, you can glean information from the passage on your first run through the material. I found this to be extremely dry and circuitous prose that required reading, then re-reading in order to make any sense out of what he was trying to say."
1,The Blame Game,"The writer is capitalizing on a tiresome, on-going hate game against Germany and Germans. There is no understanding here - just blame. Mr. Goldhagen doesn't even explore the repressive political situation most Germans found themselves in at the time, or their lack of access to information. Ordinary Germans were supposed to know what was going on, and risk everything for a group that despised them and undermined their culture at every opportunity...he expects a bit much from others, doesn't he? Writing a book about Israel's brutal occupation TODAY and ethnic cleansing ON-GOING, would be more to the point if this writer wanted to fight injustice and inhumanity. But he will never write such a book. Like many of his ilk, he is obsessed and vengeful and can't see beyond himself. Unfortunately, he has been rewarded with an academic degree, giving him more power to inflict his self-important obsession upon others."
3,Selectively Presents Facts,"While there is no doubt that the vast majority of Germans actively supported Nazi policies, there are other facts listed in the book which are clearly of a distorted nature. For instance, Goldhagen cites an example of where Germans were opposed to executing a Pole ""because (unlike Jews), Poles are human"". This is clearly atypical. Most Germans showed very little sympathy of any kind for Poles."
1,trash dressedup as research,"every single serious holocaust or nazi germany scholar on all sides of the quetsion agree at the incredibly illogical and un-academic research and conclusions put into this book.i read several chapters and wondered whether the author had (a) ever taken a course in logic or critical thinking (b) had studied the history of Nazi Germany and took any notes at all (c) or had indeed studied to any extent european history. defining modern germany primarily by anti-semitism begets the question of why germany's jews were very comfortably german ? that the anti-semitic parties were for decades upon decade a fringe group ? why the famous SD reports on the german populace repeatedly warned the regime that the acts against the jews had to be kept hidden, etc\ etc\ etc. It is sad that someone would publish this book, it is exactly this type of politically correct scholarship that it is ""dumbing"" down this nation."
3,History and emotion,"This book raises important questions and goes a fair way in resolving them. However, there's too much emotion in it and it ends up sounding more like a rant at times than a serious history tome.It begins by tracing anti-Semitism in Germany, paying special attention to the 19th century and how that ""intellectual"" anti-Semitism flowed into the Nazi race-based anti-Semitism. It then looks at concerte examples, with much attention paid to police batallions.The actions of the police batallions is the closest the book comes to dealing with the question of what ordinary Germans (i.e., women, children, and those too old to be conscripted) knew about the Holocaust, other than a few passing references.One thing it does not do, though it comes close, is paint all Germans as evil hate-mongers, as other reviews state. Goldhagen goes to some lengths in the preface to counter this perception, but I suspect it falls on deaf ears."
5,Very Well Done !,"This Concert was very Well done in sound and High Def. Clarity. The Price is set right, However, the shipping is a little High. Overall, Very good Metallica Concert ( I would say their best on DVD ). If you are a true Metallica Fan, you should order NOW !"
5,Rip-Off,"Somebody mentioned previously that this Blu-Ray is $19.99 at the Metallica Store...but they also charge $15 for shipping! I was going to order this one and the Mexico City Blu-Ray through the official Metallica store, but they were going to TRY to charge me $18 for shipping.I don't think so!Total rip-off. Amazon must order their copies from Metallica themselves, which is why it costs so much here.Any wonder why people would rather just download them via torrents?"
5,Metallica,"Great concert and set list in a remarkable venue. The camera work is awesome and it's a must have for any Metallica fan. Check out the extras also, the interviews with the band were interesting. They sounded great this night and you can see they really enjoyed playing there. Definitely worth the coin."
5,Best Blu Ray Concert EVER!,This is a awesome Blu Ray Concert from Metallica the picture and sound quality are amazing and there is no audio delay from my blu ray copy so I dint know if its luck but it works fine for me. So if your a Metallica fan and want to own a Blu Ray Concert this is worth the price and a must own.
3,Harvard's Secret Court,"In Harvard's Secret Court, William Wright illuminates the purge/witch hunt of gay students in 1920. I had been aware of the episode through other writings but became better informed through this book. The illumination of the proceedings was interesting, but I found one of the last chapters, where Wright summarized the history of homophobia the most enlightening. The stories of the trial and the subsequent life stories of the men involved seemed a bit melodramatic. Wrights talks about other interviews that were done by the Secret Court, but he does not give us any details. This leads me to believe that there was some heavy editorial work performed. The story is interesting and well told, but it seems over-sensational. It is worth reading, but with a grain of salt."
2,Implicit Homophobia,"I was very disappointed in this book.The facts themselves are interesting, but the way that William Wright presents them is not well-done.William Wright has a tone that implies:-Anybody who dared to be visibly gay deserved censure because it was foolish to be visibly gay.-Trans women are perverted and highly abnormal homosexual males.-Homophobia is natural and is genetically encoded into human beings.-The heterosexual families suffered more than the boys themselves.In addition to problems of this nature, Wright says the same things again and again and again."
3,"Not a great survey of the overall ""Fame"" franchise","This is ok if you don't already own 2 or more of the albums on CD or MP3 and don't care about what it doesn't include. To be a really ultimate, it at least should include some tracks from each of the commercially released albums up to 2005 if not also having each season of the series represented. If you already own most of whats on here, hold on until more of the albums from the series are made available for download. More complete collections that avoid ""The Kids from Fame"" billing-organized by season perhaps would be nice. I have the US albums on record. I got them as soon as they came out, but knew from the start there never going to be any radio or Billboard chart success billed as ""Kids from Fame"". It also just didn't make sense. Debbie Allen and Albert Hague were not kids. Simply ""Fame"" or ""Fame"" Cast would have been better and not sent radio programmers running in the other direction without one listen."
3,Could have been so much better,"This is a UK import, where Fame's success was pretty spectacular at the time. This CD doesn't offer much new for Fame fans but is still worthy of a purchase - even if just for Dancing Endlessly. A really great song to have on CD - but a completely out of left field choice. It would be interesting to know why it was chosen, especially over some actal Kids From Fame singles - which aren't here! I can't understand the 'Ultimate' tag, when Body Language, Songs and Be Your Own Hero are not on here. All were singles. Maybe one day there will be a proper ultimate CD, or at least one which includes all the songs from the LPs (which I still listen to - oh the shame!)."
2,You got to feel it!,The difference between a wannabe and the real thing is with Frank and other good singers the music comes from deep inside and the listener feels the music. This CD is a monotone reproduction of some music and songs. Also remember these are very classic songs but you miss the soul that Frank puts into his them. There is a Michael Bouble that comes dam close to Frank.
3,Mixed bag,"I'm a big fan of both Sinatra & John Pizzarelli. I greatly enjoy the interpretations of Sinatra standards, but have to agree with one of the other reviewers who noted how annoying it is to have to constantly adjust the volume up and down. It's too bad, because John P. does a very nice job on a number of these tunes."
1,false advertising,"got my order today,i'm very dissapointed because it is not new!used.they make money out of ready for recycling battery.i hope it has enough juice for the price,i'll just let this review be a warning."
2,Could have been better,"All in All the battery works fine. One small problem, the battery is a little thicker than it should be. This leads me suspect that some one is selling slightly defective batteries. I have no proof of this except for my battery. This causes the back of the phone (cover) to not quite fit. The battery does charge & seems to work fine other than that. I hope this is just a problem with mine."
1,Tampered? But works like new.,"850MAH LI-ION BATTERYI just got a '850MAH LI-ION BATTERY' BL-5C Nokia battery from:Shipper and seller 'SF Planet'AKA'CCMAccessories'AKA'Malcom Distributors'I have just received the battery and have it charging. I am unaware of how it will perform but will return when I am.This note is to point out that this product seems to be an official Nokia product with an official Nokia hologram sticker. The only worrying issue is that the 'serial type' number on the hologram has been marked over. I don't know what this means but it doesnt seem right.________________________________________Oct 8 2008Okay I'm upgrading my rating to four star. I charged the new out of-the-box battery on Sunday, ran it Monday, Tuesday and today Wednesday until it died at 4pm. To me that's good, that the way a new Nokia battery should act.It looses one star for the dodgy logo number cover-up which I rubbed off.My Nokia 6230 is happy and so am I."
2,Lackluster,"Battery wouldnt work with my phone, said sim inactive. came with no packaging etc. shipped fast though"
1,Get BL-6C instead,"I bought this as a replacement battery for my Nokia N-Gage QD about 3 months ago. I've had my n-gage for about 2 years now, and thought it was time to get a replacement battery. The vendor sent the battery in a timely fashion, and I have no complaint about them. However, the battery only has a standby time of less than 2 days. When I recharged my old battery that came with the N-Gage (BL-6C), it had a much longer standby time. The BL-6C is rated at 1070 mAH. I guess a difference of 250 mAH between the BL-5C and the 6C really makes a huge difference. I still use both batteries, and alternate after about a week or 2, so the other battery has a chance to discharge. In retrospect, I think the older battery is performing much better now that it has a chance to discharge from time to time. Check the model of the battery that came with the original phone, and go for the same model. If it were between the 5C and the 6C, I highly recommend the 6C. Don't get the BL-5C. Good luck."
1,Very poor!,This battery lasts far less than the battery it was supposed to replace. It is either used or not genuine.
5,Purchased through Amazon,"I purchased this battery for a Nokia 6230, it holds a charge the same as the original battery included with the phone. The battery was purchased directly from Amazon, not through a marketplace seller. While Amazon's price is higher than the marketplace sellers, it is still about 15 less than R.Shack. Amazon's battery is genuine, I was able to confim authenticity at the Nokia web site, where I entered the 20 digit scratch off number located on the front of the battery."
1,The battery from SFPlanet is NOT Nokia-is a generic fake,"The battery available from ""SFplanet"" is NOT a genuine Nokia battery, it's a generic one. But for $6 that may be what is expected. The much more expensive battery direct from Amazon is a genuine Nokia product. Too bad they use one photo for several quite different items."
2,fine okay!!,"Okay, Im not to proud to say that thought ""Stup Up"" deserved every negative you could say about it. And it was true! Even the Album cover I though was terrible (ITS A BLACK AND WHITE PHOTO OF HER HOLDING A SHOE IN A DRESS). The whole thing was a music and graphic design disaster. But the re-release looks a hell of a lot better. All the live tracks are adverage but I'll admit I've heard worse from better artist! The Madonna cover is on here and so is a duet with her father Ozzy and there not bad either. So ""changes"" focus is on the reasons people would buy the album in the first place (the fact that Ozzy is her father and her unusual hair style). But some complaints are still very true. I still think that she is doing this more for the continued fame and fortune than to show her love for music! (just look at how much she has sold-out) As far as songs that I like are about down the 50/50 between the songs I can stand to the songs I hate with a passion."
4,Kelly can sing believe it or not...,"I was skeptical about this album at first wondering if Kelly could sing.But after hearing ""Come Dig Me Out"" i was a changed man.The songs are very punky and poppy.Of course we all have heard ""Papa Don't Preach"" and ""Shut Up"",but the rest of these tracks really rock.""Changes"" with Ozzy was really cool and sentimental.Dont buy the Shut Up album.Its all here with bonus songs like ""Changes"",and live songs.I think they re-released this album for the duet with dad and to prove Kelly is not some studio enhanced gimmick.Yeah,yeah,yeah sure daddy helped.But who cares...are you jealous? We all know Kelly can rock now.So lets hope she can have a career good as Ozzy.Keep selling them records girl!"
4,Nice debut,"I've bought this album because I likes the songs ""Shut Up"" and ""Papa Don't Preach"". The first I listened to this album I was like ""it's not that good"". But now when I've listened to it for several times I'm starting to like a lot of these songs. I won't give this album a 5 star review 'cause it doesn't deserves it. But don't get me wrong, it's still 4 stars.This album contains a lot of great songs but it also has some songs I'm not really into. But they're still good.This special edition version contains some live songs. And I was suprised by the way she sang live. She really sang great. And this album contains a song with Ozzy Osbourne. Actually I like this song, but this album has better songs than ""Changes"" with Ozzy.At first I didn't like rock music a lot, but now that I listened to this album I'm starting to like it. This girl is pretty good, especially for a debut."
1,KELLY WHO???,I will bet you that in less than two years she will be almost 100% forgotten. Thankyou kelly for an amazingly average album. But what can you expect from an amazingly average singer. Better luck next time if that ever happens. I hope she learns than she cant live of daddys money forever!
1,Avril & Kelly: What do they obviousily have in common?,"(look above) wannabe punk hoes; get something better,like Pork Soda (Primus) Life After Death (Notorious B.I.G.) or 200 KMH In The Wrong Lane (TATU)."
1,please shut up already!!,"Okay kelly fans now you have to admit that she's a sell-out, can't sing at all, and is a big fat leech on society. She doesn't give a crap about the few fans she has and never will. If it wasn't for her father an MTV we wouldn't know she existed! She also thinks she can take on Christina Aguilera and thats just stupied and kind of scary.............................thank you.P.S. When the reality show goes of the air......she will be forgotten in less then a month!"
1,Buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Well, what are you waiting for! Buy it! Its Bad But WHO Cares Buy It ANYWAY!! Support everything thats wrong with the music industry today! Buy it! Buy it!! Who cares if all you need to succeed in the music industry is a famous last name! Buy it!!!!!! Who Cares if all she wants is more money and more Fame.....I CANT WAIT FOR HER NEXT CD...O'MY GOD!!!!!(I can't believe i wasted my money on a Kelly Osbourne CD) ( But, I'd BUY another copy just to burn it!)"
1,I want my $2.50 back!,"I paid $2.50 for this album at my local pawn shop. Its worth about that much. Who ever told this girl that she could sing? For that matter who ever told her that she had talent! These songs are nothing new its all been done before. She had to do ""Papa don't preach"" to sell the original and she had to do ""Changes"" with her father to sell this one! Well in both cases it didn't work though.Another thing that urks me about her is that she thinks she is such a huge rolemodel for fat teen girls. (Again its already been done) Her singing is more on the screaming side. And I think I've seen more of her music videos played in the checkout at my local Media Play then on MTV. Even the parts I did watch its was like she was just walking around saying ""look how famous I am"" and ""look how rich my daddy is"" and lets not forget ""I'm still a brat and I don't know sh_t about Punk Rock.""So in short I want my $2.50 back! And I want to stop this from everhappening again."
1,can I kick it?,"I still don't under stand ""Shut Up"" hasn't even been out a year? I hate the Duet with Ozzy because it was a black sabbath classic and she has no right! Even with her father! It was most likely Sharon's Idea we all know about her lust for money. Another thing I want to mention is that I've read alot of reviews saying that Kelly sounds like the band HOLE. To this I have to say ""!!!Yea RIGHT!!!."" Anyway......."
1,KELLY IS BUTCHERING A CLASSIC HERE!!!,This cd was put out only to make her greedy family more money.It's actually her first cd with some new material on it so its really nothing new.I feel that her first cd was horrible and the new material sucks.I cant believe ozzy would let her own daughter butcher a classic song like changes but then again they are a greedy family.Kelly's career will soon be short lived because she has yet to impress many of us.DONT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!
5,Great follow-up to The Dying Ground,"While I loved Tramble's first book, The Dying Ground, I was even more pleased with her follow-up. The characters, story and themes were outstanding, but what really affected me was the quality of Tramble's writing. In The Dying Ground, she recreated the world of Oakland in the late 1980s; in this book, there is the same attention to detail, but a compressed sparsity of language that fuels the tension, propelling the reader to make an all-nighter of The Last King. Well done!"
1,No Good,I just wanted to tell everyone... don't waste your time or money on this album! Go buy something else... not this junk.
4,Traditional Folksongs with an Edge,"This cd was a revelation for me. This is a rather rough live recording from the mid 1960's, that captures Carthy and Swarbrick playing passionately and off the cuff. The traditional songs presented here have all the rollick and fire of the Clancy Brothers. There are a few melancholy slow ballads here (the fantastic ""The Wind that Shakes the Barley""), and there are several fabulous saucy and suggestive little ditties (the wonderfully lewd ""Bonnie Black Hare"") as well as some absolutely firey instrumentals. There is a certain enrgy to this recording that only a live show can generate. It's powerful, informal and a rollicking good time. Highly recommended."
3,Funky Strappy Sandle,Great with a pair of jeans...strap cuts across at an odd part of the toe and makes them a strictly lunch or dinner shoe...can't walk very far in them b/c of the uncomfort...but worth it b/c they do make a statment
5,It's Heavenly,"From the introductory chords of ""Everlasting Hope"" to the final cadence on ""I'll Say Yes"", 'Heaven' is what this album brings to mind. Whenever I listen to the songs, they uplift me from the inside. The music will minister to you; it definitely brightens my day. It's an experience I love to repeat over and over again. Truly, Jesus Be Praised!"
5,Great Air Conditioner,Great features with multiple settings. Very quiet. You wont be disapointed. Great product and great price.
3,Good but NOT quiet,"This is an average AC that cools well but it is far from quiet and even further from ""library quiet."" I have two of these and regret putting one in my son's room because of the loud compressor. In no way, shape or form should this air conditioner be called quiet. I do have two higher BTU Sharp ACs and they can certainly be called quiet."
3,A mind boggling story.,"Maniac was a very original thriller. I liked the fact that they made the villan a kind of parasite. It was around for a very long time, and it only came back every four hundred years. It's kind of a Freddy Crougar thing where they get you in your sleep. The parasites feed off of intelligent people's minds and eventually they die. Dawn and Shane's theory sounded crazy, but in the end they were right.Maniac is a good book that makes you think and is a good suspense story."
5,A Must Read,"In a perfect world every serious student of philosophy would be required to start with Fr. O'Donnell's thrilling travelogue through the ancient streets of true philosophy. One is enlightened almost magically to the realization that there really are absolutes; that truth is not only within our reach but actually quite easily grasped. Error becomes readily identifiable,e.g, how the theory of relativity was falsely applied to the moral order until these modern times hold that everything is relative,indeed that there is no such thing as absolute truth.This is an absolute ""must read"" for all men of good will."
5,Beautiful CD,"Belive me people, this is truly a sweet cd. Arguably Luciano at his best. No Boom tunes but a very mellow relaxing peaceful mindset. Wicked version of the Tosh classic, gotta say I prefer the messenger's version! ....Nevamind!!!... Bless"
3,A Good Start,"This book is pretty good to be the author's first novel, and it is self published at that. The story line is simple and easy to follow, and hints at the style of Erick Jerome Dickey. At the end there is a surprising twist that pops out of the blue, and really engages the reader to reflect on the novel as a whole in the context of the title. The middle does get a bit habitual and slightly repetitive, but the book is short enough for the reader to plow through the little lull without a problem. I think this is a solid novel that shows growth and promise in the author's future works. There's nowhere to go but up!"
1,What's on the OUTSIDE is what matters...,"All I have to say is, the cover of this book is what pulled me in. The artistry is hauntingly brillant, simple yet emotionally intense. However, as I began to read this novel, I fell asleep. No depth whatsoever, so don't be fooled by the genius artistry of the cover."
1,Disappointing,I was extremely disappointed after watching this DVD. It is only about 15 minutes long and just flew through his life. It didn't give very much info about Malcolm X at all. There has got to be better documentaries about Malcolm X out there. Don't waste your money on this one.
1,THE INFO GIVEN HERE SAYS IT IS FOURTEEN MINUTES LONG,"the reviewer pans it at thirty minutes (a buck a minute) but the info given here (almost the ONLY info) is that it is not half that!I wish there would be some DVD collecting all his recorded speeches, especially on fatherhood as indicated at the end of Spike Lee's joint."
3,Nice at first,"We had our homebuilder install this in our new house. It looks nice and worked very well for a while. 2 years later, though, there are a lot of small cracks developing on both the sprayer and the faucet itself. The sprayer is getting bad enough that it is leaking. If I was doing it again, I would keep looking."
5,Exercise Ball,The exercise ball arrived when promised. I haven't inflated it yet as we are just setting up a workout area.
3,Sadly disapointed - I was really looking forward to this!,"I was a huge fan of Motion and I thought the Remix EP was pretty good, so I was eagerly anticipating the release of Every Day. To be honest, I was a little let down. It's the vocal thing. It's just not as, well, ""cinematic."" Instead of a nebulous, jazz looped soundscape, we now have a band. Instead of free spaces where the listener's mind could unwind in it's own directions, we have vocalists telling us what to think and when to think it. Perhaps I'm just a loop junkie. I loved the way that the loops intensified on Motion and tightened and loosened with such grace. Now it's a band. A VERY talented band, but a band. As for the production and the performances, everything is top notch. The 7/8 drum assault on Flite is one for the record books. The bass mix is stunning, as it was on Motion, and there is plenty of ""air"" in the mix so things remain spacious. I miss the freedom though. I'll keep spinning Motion and I'll wait for the next remix EP."
3,The first song was great,"The first song on this CD is awesome, but I lost interest from there. Some of the songs at the end get really tedious. I sold the CD after listening to it once or twice. I think they could have done a better job."
3,If the vocals could only be excluded,"There are some very juicy downtempo loops and sounds in here that effect a deep pondering mood--at least for me. But then the vocals come in and impose something that just does not mesh with these images and emotions that I had been, up to that point, immensely enjoying. It's like the vocals pull you into a different musical space, one that does not work for me. I wish I could edit the tracks in Logic and strip out the vocals."
4,Moving musicians,"Inspired jazz-fusion with rock sensibility, these creative and unassuming seven tracks make up an inspired, if not transcendent listening experience anchored by soulful vocals, stimulating arrangements, and fluid percussion."
3,Cute but not comfortable for me,I purchased these to wear with my halloween costume. They look great but rub in several places so I am returning them. I tried walking around the house in them to test them out and it just won't work out without multiple bandaids and a gel insert for the instep. Pretty shoes. Wish I could wear them.
5,The Beggars Are Coming,"A sometimes raw book about the old, old Hollywood. It begins with silent movies and the producers and stars. The ugly side of show business is discussed throughout the book. The sex life of movie stars and how their image were protected is also discussed. The story follows a young boy's life starting out as a messenger in the silent movie era all the way to his middle age. At middle age, he was a power player in the movie business. At the beginning, he was sweet. At the end, he was a dirty old man who turned to greed, wealth, and sex."
4,the original angry Asian man,"The thing with Frank Chin is that he really makes the reader work. You're going to read his fiction and think to yourself, ""What in the world is he talking about?!""The thing with Frank Chin's fiction is that his ideas are far more compelling than the stories themselves or his writing style:-the idea that a ""Chickencoop Chinaman"" is farmed and created in isolation by a society built on internal colonialism-the lack of role models for Chinese men in America, which leads the protagonist to desperately believe that the Lone Ranger is AsianLike all of his works of fiction, The Chickencoop Chinaman and The Year of the Dragon are rough reads. This is not the type of stuff you read for pleasure, but you read with the assistance of a college course on Asian American lit."
1,Very Amatuer,"What a waste of time it was reading this book. If you are not very familiar with FW/IPS or VPN then this may be helpful, but if you have been working with this technology and Cisco's products that address these technologies (ASA, PIX, IPS, VPN3k) then please don't refer to this joke. Go online to cisco.com and do the research. Sometimes it felt as if whitepapers were copied and pasted.Very dissapointed."
4,My daughter loved it,"A lot of what plays into successful test-taking is attitude. This book builds confidence and shows ways to approach a difficult exam in a positive way. It is a very interesting read, and emphasizes the importance of preparation to success.If you are looking for practice exams, however, this is not your book."
4,Big Bill's #28 of 2001.,"No, not quite as good as Pavement but that's what I expected. I went into to this expecting a mediocre disc that was OK, but not as good as previous recordings. What I got was a CD that I consider real good, but not as good as previous recordings. Plus 3 of the 4 stars come on the strength of 1 song...track #8 Pink India. This is one of the Top 5 songs of the year and that alone make the disc worth buying. Don't expect it to be better than Pavement and all will be well."
5,Divine divine divine divine,"""I'm not what you think I am..."" this is the music you need!I've many a Pavement moments seen and, the Jicks are rock-they're pop and the inventive lyrics keep a cauldron of embers that spark my own creative fires when I read them.I've scribbled lines from these Jicks songs on everything from guest checks at work,to the mens room in Saginaw. Styles on this platter range from seventies pop to warm tv dinners on a sunday night with my dog. Long and short flowing songs that stick to your mind,knock on your shoe and require repeated listens-yes,things don't get much better than this album full of moods and mixes for the pirate and politician in us all. Looks like Stephen has fun in his studio and mind making music that is enjoyable to each and all including himself! I know I'll be back for more, long live the Jicks! thanks! ""too awake to be famous,too wired to be safe..."" oh yeah, just BUY this album now!!"
5,FYI,"I noticed that a few reviewers are off the mark on 'Jo Jo's Jacket. The ""truly arbitrary snippet of some guy talking about the shaving of his head"" is from Yul Brynner--also the subject of the song: ""perhaps you saw me in 'Westworld', I acted like a robotic cowboy."" By the way, if you aren't already convinced that most album critics are prime examples of self-confirming bias, check out the editor's comment on the Brynner sample: a thinly veiled statement about Malkmus' intent? C'mon, it's just a funny tribute to a bald guy."
5,and in a funny way...,"Let me say this, viz., this album is like a really great ham sandwich. And not Buddig on Wonder bread, but Black Forest Ham on a good baguette with premium butter. It's apparently simple, but the quality is so good that it is a classic, completely enjoyable and satisfying, I never get tired of it. It has enough flair to be slightly European in flavor, but it is still a wonderful comfort food. Brilliant all around. Thanks SM."
4,The Moment's Over.,"Every group/singer has their moments, their 15 minutes of creative peak if you will. Pavement had three albums, which is longer than most, and it is shorter than some. That moment, I regret to say, has passed. While the last two Pavement albums were decent, and far above the pop fray, they will never again achieve their ""moment"" again. Having said that this is a quality CD, and anyone who hasn't heard of Pavement will think that it is great."
5,awesome!!,"Im not going to go into detail about the differences about pavement v malkmus solo work other than to say that this is an absolutely brilliant album start to finish. Honestly, there is not one bad song this album just flows and is totally enjoyable in its quirkiness. Malkmus is the most brilliant song-writer out there right now. This will take time to grow on you. I honestly think this took me about 4 years to fully understand and internalize. .there are just so many instruments, sounds, melodies and counter melodies on his albums that you have to give ample time to digest. Buy it now, buy it now, buy it now."
4,Jury's Still Out,"I do like this album, okay? Great tunes, an earthy sounding band, everyone's heart in the right place, etc. Plus it sounds an awful lot like Pavement. Which will lead people to conclude Pavement really was the one-man band it often seemed to be. But this is a distinct retreat from the heights reached on Pavement's final disk, the ingenious and incredible 'Terror Twilight.' I hope this is merely a case of someone acclimating to a new bunch of musicians and that, next time, he re-ups the ante and really puts out. Until then, I'm a little worried that Malkmus's career is starting to resemble Paul Westerbereg's. (You rememeber Westerberg? Supposedly the Replacements were a one-man band, too.) I'm not going to panic. Malkmus has always let his love for the music guide his actions, and a mega-talented fellow can hardly go wrong with that strategy, right?"
4,A Liberation From Stupid Vanities,"Come on in, Pavement fans; the water's fine. The ponderous ballads and spacy noodlings of Pavement's last records have given way to some of the inspired looniness of earlier days. Songs like ""Troubble"" and ""Jo-Jo's Jacket"" hold up to anything off ""Slanted and Enchanted."" ""The Hook"" and ""Jennifer and the Ess Dog"" spin out longer, tighter narratives with more focus than Malkmus showed of late with the band. There's some filler on the record, but Malkmus at half-speed is better than most platinum bands at full tilt. Sad as I am to see Pavement go, this feels like a move forward. Don't know if Malkmus'll ever best his old sound--in a blind taste test you'd probably think this was Pavement--but why mess with a glorious thing? It seems like everyone's having more fun now, and so will you. Forget the cult status (so '90s!) and enjoy!"
2,Disappointing,"This album has everything going for it that Pavement did, except one: charm. It is a well-crafted and expertly played album, to be sure. But The Jicks just don't have the same ragged charm that Pavement did. In this new context lines that might have sounded quirky/charming with Pavement sound quirky/condescending. A subtle, but important distinction that makes this a far less enjoyable listening experience than even the least of Pavement's offerings. I don't think SM has lost anything personally. The only thing he's lost is the perfect band to back him up."
3,"Invest in a clean t-shirt, Mr. Malkmus.","You know, I can't stress the importance of a clean, crisp white t-shirt. 100% cotton. Pressed neatly. Ahhh, one of the simple luxuries of life. That's why I was already disturbed by the cover art of STEPHEN MALKMUS' self-titled solo album. A tragedy.Customers who bought this album also bought:A clue"
2,Too hard to use.,Hated it. This book was too convoluted to understand well. they made the sections too large. You have to read thru so much material to use in a random encounter that is becomes unusable in a game situation.
5,A really great little book,This is a really great little book about Miami. The stories she tells about the sights give you a feeling for the city and a lot of information. You can tell this is written by someone who really loves the area. The prices are higher now but the sights are still the same.
2,Moby - eh.,"If you already own Play, or 18 don't bother with this one. Nothing new or exciting here. Spend your money on the above two CDs instead."
2,critical review,"To some people his songs may sound ecstatic, ""in the zone"" so to speak, however his songs seems very common and typical. To make a point his songs are very repetitive, monotonous, and time consuming. To me listening to his ""work"" makes me have to make an effort in listening to his music and it is not as I had expected. I originally found his song ""extreme ways"" cool because it related to the movie ""Jason Bourne: Bourne Ultimatum"" and it gave a character to the Movie. I admit I am no artist but I do know a good piece of work when I see one. Hopefully this helps you in deciding to buy this album and please if you can DO NOT buy the dubstep ugh... it makes his songs worse."
3,Satisfied But Disappointed,"I received this item a few days after ordering it, however it was not the correct item that I ordered. It was disappointing to be notified that the cd that I wanted was no longer available. Athough I was refunded my money and I did not have to return the cd, I really wanted the cd that I ordered."
4,The mostly best of.,"This is actually a good collection of Moby, though mostly of his work from ""Play"" and afterwards. Of course there's still a few flaws. It's only 61 minutes, should be a good 70. There's alot from his huge album ""Play"", but it's still missing ""Bodyrock"". It IS on the remix disc, but is nearly a different song. Also from ""Play"" is ""South Side"", but it is NOT the superior version with Gwen Stefani. Why not? Who knows. However, the new track ""New York, New York"" with Debbie Harry is good, and we get other big hits such as ""We Are All Made Of Stars"" and ""Beautiful"". Plus a new mix of ""Go"" and a live ""Feeling So Real"". The remix disc is a bonus for fanatics. Others might not care so much. This collection would go well with ""Mobysongs 93-98"". Still does the job alone though."
1,Watch where you buy it?,"Depending on which store delivers it you might not get what ""EXACTLY"" you think you ordered. As per the Moby website/wikipedia http://www.moby.com/discography/go_very_best_moby.htmlFive different versions of Go - The Very Best of Moby were released in different regions of the world. Each version contains different songs, based on the singles and their popularity in that region. All songs are edited versions of the album mixes, unless noted. You might not be delivered the one you wanted."
2,Interesting but mediocre,"This book held my interest but is no where near as good a the famous Josephine Tey book ""Daughter of Time.""The the characters are dated and characatures."
3,A disappointment,"I read Josephine Tey's The Daughter of Time and it really caught me up. I know this book at the beginning says it won't be what The Daughter of Time is, but I was not prepared for such a shallow and silly work as this book turned out to be. It is the first book by Elizabeth Peters I have read, and does not inspire me to read another by her. I thought the character development was very poor. And the people were so incredible that one knew they are fakes."
1,Murhers of Richard III - The Boring,"I have read all of Barbara Michaels books and they are wonderful. I have also been reading some of her other books under the name of Elizabeth Peters. Of all of her books, this is the only one that I can truly say I couldnt stand. I was very surprised that she would write a book that was boring. Please read some of her other works, this book will give you a false view of the author. Usually she is an excellent writer."
5,What a great pair of G.I.Joes!,"This is a great two pack. If it were only Crosshair, it would be a must buy pack. He comes with an awesome guillie suit (camoflague suit) along with a sweet hat and web gear (straps for knives and grenades etc.) finished off with a sweet sniper rifle. His paint scheme is incredible. He's only half the pack, though. Claws Commander is also a cool figure, though he pales in comparison to Crosshair. He comes with a helmet to cover his menacing face and a cool little pistol. His hand placement is a little cause for problem, but that is it."
3,Book - Meet Strawberry Shortcake,The book was new but it took the longest to ship out of all the items I purchased. I would have liked a short summary of the book before purchasing it. The whole story was based around her birthday party.
3,A Closer Look delivers...,"""A Closer Look"" details some of Babyface's earlier tracks as well some new ones that have been remixed. He takes us to the early days when ""Chivalry"" was considered one of the most important aspects of love. The remix of ""It's No Crime"" takes us all to the dance floor immediately, while the sultry groove of ""Whip Appeal"" is always a welcome bedroom pleasure. Also included in this project are the classics, ""Love Saw It,"" with Karyn White sharing lead with 'Face, and a remix of ""Love Makes Things Happen,"" featuring Pebbles with 'Face. A very decent remix project put together..."
5,It is not Brian Boyd but...,"There is always a but...In this case, the only but is this:Brian Boyd has already told the samebefore in a better way.Comparisons are odious. I know.Buy this if you are a lover of Nabókov.Of course, before read Boyd's."
5,Explaining the dollar's decline,Petrodollar Warfare is the best attempt at explaining the recent free fall of the U.S. Dollar and giving another reason to why we hold onto this failed war in Iraq.
1,Complete disapointment,"This DVD is mainly about the cinematographer's ego, lots of artistic shots of nothing. Having heard and seen Glennie perform, I was hoping for some of that magic on the DVD. There was none."
1,What a bore!!!!!,"I bought this movie from acorn media, and luckily they allow you to return it, which I did because it was just mind-numbing and tedious. The only redeeming part was a very small quip about her childhood, which the director should have developed on.Yes we get it, sound is everywhere, and you can feel it in the vibrations. I don't need an entire movie to tell me this."
4,concern deaf people?,A reference. Un important lesson for our lives.But it does not have any kind of subtitles!
3,ok?,its ok... not like whoa must buy it... could have spend the money on something I would be happier with. oh well..
5,I LOVE MY NEW PRINTER,"This printer is wonderful..it prints, copies, scans with no problem. The print quality is very good. It is quick as a bunny. The cost of $95 was very reasonable. The only minor minus ..It sounds like R2D2 as it readies itself. I highly recommend this printer."
2,Having no ink makes this a big paperweight,"I was happy with this printer/scanner combo until I found out that you can't use the scanner if you run out of ink. Also, you can't use recycled cartridges because of the ""programming"" on them.Otherwise it's great."
4,Printer all in one,The printer came in 2 days so far works great I am very pleased with it I would highly recommend it.
3,too credulous but not bad,"I looked forward to reading this, and it starts well but then becomes bogged down in lionizing unskeptically such performance artists as Orlan, the woman who continues to have plastic surgery as her ""transgressive"" ""art,"" and stories of the dated antics of Carolee Schneeman. It's nice that the author doesn't much care for Andrea Dworkin, but she goes head over heels for Bret Easton Ellis and Kathy Acker, whose literary accomplishments I think have been hit and miss at best. The best thing in the book is the attention paid to David Cronenberg and J.G. Ballard, including interviews with each."
5,Happy,I am very pleased with this product; it met my expectations and is a great lullaby CD for any baby.
4,Informative video,"This is a good video, very informative. It compares favorably with, for instance, National Geographic and Reader's Digest videos. The computer recreates of the ancient structures are good. When superimposed on the modern grounds, you can see it's artificial because the lighting is wrong. It would be nice if all ancient structures that can be restored and rebuilt are done so.This video puts much emphasis on the Pyramids and Sphinx of Giza having been built by the ancient Egyptians. Not everyone believes that.The video could have had normal color footage, instead of that faded black and white footage for the ancient everyday scenes.This series of 3 should also be available on DVD."
3,My granddaughter wanted this for Christmas,I really don't think a rag doll this size or any size should be this much. I know she will like it but I won't order again.
5,goovy girls princess,I bought this for my 3 year old because she loves princesses. I tried to find it in the stores buy no one carries the princesses. She has had a lot of fun playing with it and has even been able to sleep with it because it is very soft. It's good that the clothes are attached so you don't have to worry about losing them. We are definitely going to buy more groovy girls princesses to go with her collection.
3,Not a Curly Hair Doll,"I bought this doll for my curly haired 3 year old and when she arrived, she did NOT have curly hair. The picture is deceptive. Very disappointed."
1,review,"Extremely over dramatized. Richard Archer and the rest of the cast may have talent but simply tried too hard for emotional hardness. Almost like the Chinese actor--good plot, too much forced emotion which was obvious and overplayed to the point of cliche, I see talent in some of these actors and hope they improve. Really liked the story line--music didn't match the setting though. Just my opinion but I think if Archer and the rest had softened the emotional drive it would have hit home in the genre of American Beauty. Great story that was overplayed."
1,1 star for 1 laugh,"Totally unfunny. At least borat and bruno had a few laughs. Not this one. It was hard not to turn it off, hate wasting my time."
1,Buyer Be Ware,"Received this dvd in the mail....it was a illegal copy. No copyright marks, no case. Had to throw it away, I don't like dealing in illegal items."
1,Worst Sacha Baron Cohen movie I have ever seen,"I had a feeling this was going to be a pretty awful movie based on the previews, but I loved the Ali G Hbo Show, Borat, and Bruno, so I gave it a shot. Well, hopefully I can save you some time - don't see this movie.The plot is simple. That's fine. The problem is that the comedy is really weak and really contrived. I don't recollect busting out laughing at any point (and I really love Sacha's previous work... so I really wanted to love this). It just was a bunch of tired, predictable jokes. No real twists or turns. The acting was pretty subpar across the board.Anyway, bottom line - its a comedy that couldn't draw a single laugh out of me. I wouldn't watch the movie again and really recommend that you pass on this one (and this is coming from a fan...)"
1,Not funny at all,the worst movie ever made; I could not even complete 20 min of this ridicules thing. I do not recommend this movie to anyone.
3,Funny but dumb.,"Semi funny movie, could be offensive to some. Maybe I am just getting older and more annoyed, who knows.Decent movie at best however."
2,Tyrannical hegemony over my time.,"Eh.Some cute vignettes, but that's it.Does not hold together well.Characterizations not even believable in comedy...better was ""You Don't Mess With the Zohan"".Although the problems with Adam Sandler's hair were in another latitude..."
1,One of the worst movies ever.,I watch just about everything. This is one of the worst movies I have come across in a couple of years. It just didn't comparing to the previous movie. Was hoping to like this on some level. Turned it of 35 minutes in.
2,Had expectations after Howard Stern interview...,but was really let down. I did not laugh at all during this entire movie. He should have stopped at Borat
2,Boring,"I enjoyed Sacha's previous films but this was boring and cliched. OK, so his previous films are cliche but they had that edge of your seat realism that is simply lost in the new scripted format.I cut my losses half way through because I knew where things were going plot-wise and enjoyment-wise."
4,Dictator was less than Borat,"The Dictator was okay and it was pretty funny I guess Baron Cohen is a fairly amusing fellow he reminds me of The Marx Brothers or Cheech and Chong in some ways. I personally found ""Borat"" much funnier than ""The Dictator"" if I show someone how funny Baron Cohen is, I put ""Borat"" in my DVD player,...it just seems much funnier. Did not like any of Cohen's Rapper type films,..just not amusing. Yet I feel ""The Dictator"" has it's merits of ridicule of that type of government or the lack thereof. Although Baron Cohen appears to be making light of his Jewishness it always come through as just that, just like the Marx Brothers did. May watch again."
2,Flat,This movie fell flat with poor humor. It did not bring anything new to the once funny Cohen. I did not even finish the movie
2,Love Sasha Baron-Cohen; Not Dictator,I love Sasha Baron-Cohen. I thought Borat was hillarious and Bruno very good. The Dictator I didn't like. I think the D Ali G Show was groundbreaking and his characters from those shows the absolute best. He should carry those characters forward. I await the (really would be second due to the British movie) D Ali G Movie.
2,The Flop,This was the worst of his films. Would of much rather watched Ali G 100 times over than this movie :(
3,"Funny only in parts, nothing to remember or buy","I rented it from Redbox thank goodness. It was mildly funny in parts, and other parts where like WTH? I never saw Borat or that other stupid movie. But this one I thought looked funny in previews. It is like I said in parts but over all not so great. I wouldn't buy it or own it for sure, maybe rent it if I had seen everything else with nothing else to rent (which was my case)."
1,a waste of comedy,"Although the movie started out as stupidly funny, it increasingly became more stupid and less funny. I didn't even make it to the end of the movie. Drinking poison would be more entertaining than watching this flick."
1,Save your money,I really regret watching this movie. The funny parts are in the trailer. It was not funny and was rather racist. Save your money.
1,Turned it off half way through.....it sucked!,I loved Borat and Bruno and can watch them over and over and still laugh. I watched 40 minutes of this one and never laughed once....turned it off. This might be the end for Cohen.
1,Nothing like the Borat Movies-this is weak,"This movie has minimal humor in it. Many comparisons to common day dictators and in that some humor. Overall, boring."
1,You've gotta be...,"...kidding me! This is by far the worst Cohn movie made. Sasha takes a good idea & then totally messes it up with gutter humor, stupid jokes & some sick need for him to display his gonads to every last person in the world. Don't waste you money on this film. It is a loser. The other interesting thing about Cohn is that he always finds a way to diss conservatives but it literally the best example of liberalism run amok. He is just not funny anymore-simply stupid. If you are a 12 yr. old or have the IQ of your average cabbage, this movie is for you. Otherwise, skip it & watch the grass grow."
1,Terrible... why would someone pay for this?,"This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. When I saw the trailer of this movie, I was expecting maybe a couple of funny scenes... but in reality, this whole movie is so bad I was so tempted to turn it off and watch the Kardashian show (and thats pretty bad).I do not recommend this movie to anyone, even if you are trapped in a shelter, with no cable, no radio, no Internet and the only thing you have is a dvd and this movie? not even there, I would recommend you to watch it. It is a waste of time."
3,THE DICTATOR --- GUARANTEED TO OFFEND SOMEONE,"While THE DICTATOR certainly won't win any politically correct awards, it still has lots of laughs, admittedly offensive and crude, but you still can't help going along for the ride.Sasha Baron Cohen gleefully cavorts through his role as the vile self-serving dictator of a fictitious Middle East country. Blacks, Jews, gays, vegans....no group is spared. The delightful Anna Faris is a perfect companion to Cohen, once again proving she's the queen of the spoofs! Ben Kingsley seems to be having a great time and John C. Reilly has a dynamite cameo,THE DICTATOR is one of those films you feel guilty laughing at, but there are some funny scenes to justify that guilt!"
3,Okay,The movie wasn't as funny as I thought it would be. Still if you are looking for a few good laughs then by all means check this out.
3,"Not Cohen's best, but funny","In his latest opus, Sacha Baron Cohen offers his unique interpretation of a romantic comedy. Hilarity ensues as a dictator of a made-up Middle Eastern country is replaced by a body double, winds up in New York, and finds love in the Big Apple. It's the best parts of Coming to America and Trading Places, all in one movie."
2,disappointing,There are a few funny parts but overall very disappointing. I love Borat and Bruno. It's not filmed the same way as those where I.e. the documentary style.
2,Disappointing,"I am a huge fan of his other work, but this movie was flat. It was not funny and seemed more like a contractual obligation film than anything. It was just a pale retread of his other (good) movies, like Borat. Don't bother"
2,Subpar,"Ever since Borat came out, the quality of Sacha Baron Cohen's movies has gone straight down. I do not recommend this movie."
2,waste of time,"Wells, this movie was a waste of money, time. I slept through the whole movie. I do not recomend to watch."
1,Horrible,Since Borat I've found Sasha Baron Cohen's movies to get less funny and more crude. It's rare that I'll turn off a movie but I just couldn't make it to the end of this one.
1,disappointment,Another disappointment from Cohen; Predictable sketches and worn out cliches make for a dull viewing. Would not pay money for this product.
1,Four thumbs down.,"A very silly and crude movie. If you are hard up for 'entertainment' or like off the chart stuff, then try it. I saw no point to any of it but gave it one star out of sheer kindness."
1,Ummm...How about no!,"A friend and I went to see this in the theaters the day it came out and I wish I could get my $19 back. The movie was terrible. I love usually love this type of movie, but this one just didn't do it for me. The stereotypes and jokes were much to predictable and more often than not they were taken too far. For the record, most people are not so stupid that you have to shove the same thing in their face twelve times just for them to understand the already moronic excuse for a joke. This is not worth anyone's time. Even if they think that this movie is worth their time, its not. It needs to go away. Parody comedy at its worst in The Dictator. Fail upon the writers and directors."
4,Dictator,It was pretty funny. I enjoyed watching it. Like thhe digital downloads from Amazon you dont have to wait for it to buffer.
2,Bawdy,"Some of it was funny, some vulgar. Watched it once, but no more. Would have been better without the vulgar parts."
3,funny,standard SBC fare: well done and no unexpected twists. a funny movie. i guess i need to add more words...
3,It's not that I didn't like it..... but it's stupid!,"Not a movie I would purposely watch again although, there were a few giggles. 1-1/2 hours lost that can never be returned."
2,very disapointing,"Very disappointing, loved Borat, but this was way to predicable and boring.I only watched it about half way through before getting completely bored"
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"Obvious stereotypes without any true wit. Low brow terribly predictable and an utter waste of time. If you like dumb humor you might get a chuckle here and there, but you'll probably just end up hating yourself for making such a bad choice to watch this.Awful, just awful."
1,Awful Awful Awful,This movie was just terrible. It was embarrassing to watch. The funny parts are few and far between - it is blatantly just gross in some parts but not in a funny way. Sacha Baron Cohen lost the fine line he walked on Borat between vulgarity and hilarity and dove right into the vulgar side. He lost the funny on this one.
1,Awful in a bad way,"I do love a good wiener fart humor movie...but this is NOT it. Predictable, lame, unoriginal, boring. Anna Faris and everyone else in this film should be embarrassed. Sacha could have made this a smart, witty or dark humored flick and still included the shot of a fake big-bushed weenie coming at you. It's got no heart, is dumbed down, and is a waste of time production. I felt small for watching it."
1,The Dictator is Trash,"The Dictator was so awful, we quit watching after about five minutes. We had thought Sasha Baron Cohen's Borat was funny, although we cringed at many of the scenes. This latest effort might entertain junior high age boys. The few minutes we watched were like watching pornography made by a thirteen year old."
1,Not worth it.,"I generally thought I liked SBC's brand of humor -with the exception of ALI G or whatever that waste of film was called- which is more how I would compare this film to rather than Bruno or Borat which were funnier because they had the illusion of being spontaneous and prankish. I waited for this film to be released, and had high hopes but this was a disappointment. The punch lines get old and overused and this film is mostly boring and predictable in a adolescent and moronic way. There were a couple funny scenes but in general it had good potential and was a flop.Just look somewhere else for entertainment cause this is not that funny."
3,Same movie...,"Same movie-different name. Borat, Bruno, Dictator... whatever you call it- its the same. It was very funny though. Okay- so it isn't exactly the same movie but the style of comedy that Sacha Baron Cohen uses can sometimes get a little worn out. But this was my favorite of the three I listed by leaps and bounds! It is a good laugh- you just gotta be in the right mood for it."
5,funny!,"I am not a fan of Sasha's - generally I find his stuff outrageously ""not funny"" especially after his Ali G' character which actually was extremely funny but this movie was hysterical almost from beginning to end - definitely worth seeing"
1,bad movie choice.,"I have never been a Sasha Baron Cohen fan. But my husband adores him, so reluctantly we rented this movie. I hated it, and my husband was in shock at how horrible it was."
5,Surprisingly good movie,We have a good laugh with this movie. From the trailer I was wondering if all the good stuff have been shown. But it turns out not the case.
2,Stupid Overrated Movie,We liked his other movies but this one was a real drag. I would not recomment this to anyone anywhere.
2,horrible,Just a very silly comedy. One those too stupid comedies. I rather watch a real one. There was a dumb plot. Stupid doesn't make it funny. SMH
3,It lightly tickled me,"It was so something to watch, what can I say? It was humor in its crudest form. Make sure the kiddies are asleep!"
2,very disappointing and bad humor,this movie has got some funny spots but mostly it dragged and the comedy was very disgusting I thought it would be alot funnier but Borat was much better than this. I was looking for a cleaner version but there is none
2,Bad movie,"Movie wasn't what I anticipated. Had it's moments, but overall wasn't funny or worth the investment. Maybe next time Sacha."
2,Well...,"It is an entertaining movie, but Borat and Bruno were way better. I didnt enjoy it much. Thought it was silly."
1,So disappointing...,This is nothing like Borat or Bruno. Sacha Baron Cohen should stick to what he's good at---unscripted comedies with shock factor. This movie was a complete bore. Not even Anna Faris could save it.
1,"Terrible, terrible","I cannot understand why this actor receives any accolades at all. I understand outrageous disguised as art. But when art pantomimes stupidity, it's time to pull the plug on the so-called actors ambitions."
1,Horrible movie,"Very crude & distasteful. I tried to watch it with my almost 13 year old, since I was told it was very funny, by a cousin who had seen it twice. We turned it off after a bit."
1,Horrible video quality.,"I ordered the HD version, HD wouldn't even load. My internet connection is plenty fast. All the good jokes in the movie were in the trailer... Kind of disappointing."
1,terrible. absolutely terrible.,"lousy, predictable and extrenely crude-to call it humor would be a compliment to this piece of trash. I feel dumber after watching even the first half, after which I turned it off. It would be more entertaining to take three one dollar bills and light them on fire."
2,Massively Disappointed,"I'd been looking forward to seeing this one. I even checked local theaters about 6 weeks after it started playing and was surprised to see it was no longer playing here (Las Vegas). That should have made me suspicious. I think SBC is a fantastic talent and have loved all his work up until Dictator. Unfortunately, his foray into pure fiction was a disaster. After a reasonably strong start, this film falls into predictable, mildly humorous moments that added up to my fighting to stay awake and then giving up entirely. SBC you get one more crack at pure fiction, and if it fails again you need to go back to the fool them once worlds of Ali G, Borat, and Bruno that provided me with some of the most entertaining video moments of my life. One star is for the first 20 minutes and the other is for the beard."
3,Slap stick,"I am not into slap stick what I can say is, I liked it much more than his previous one, Borat.The story is interesting a third-world country is threatened by United Nations sanctions. He goes to the UN to speak. In the process, he gets kidnapped, escapes and meets up with a Jewish girl who takes him up under her wing.Some of the dialogue, I thought were good.The acting, overall is typical for such slap stick movies. I do not like it, but some do.The filming is ordinary, I can assure you that you will not be blown away by any of the graphics."
1,The DICTATOR,"I have viewed previous Sasha Cohen Baron movies and was always able to find some humor in them dispite the shameless vulgarity. But the DICTATOR went too far with its senseless insults of ethnic groups. The scene with him playing a video game of the killing of Israel's athletes at the Olympics was appalling. The movie was crude, insensitive, racial and far from entertaining. I'm sorry I rented it."
1,One of the worst movies I've seen.,This movie was not funny at all. I barely even cracked a smile and ended up walking away from it. I should have been paid the $3.99 rental fee to watch it. Do not waste your time or money.
1,Don't waste your money.,Terrible movie. Couldn't even make it through the entire thing. Horrible plot. Horrible idea. Don't waste your money by renting this.
1,this was so bad I didn't finish watching it.,I was super disappointed. I'm a big Cohen fan and this movie was straight up stupid. I watched 30 minutes which felt like 30 hours and stopped wasting my time.
1,s/b NO STARS - Complete Failure,I Can't Beleive I Was Actually Looking Forward To Seeing This Movie.Sasha Really Failed With This One.He Should Have Stuck With His Previous Characters.Just Glad I Didn't Go To A Theater To See It
3,Mindless Comedy,A funny mindless movie for when you just want some pointless fun. Watched it on the streaming option. The streaming technology worked well enough.
3,Ok,This is just ok. Typical funny dumb movie that is good to watch once but no good story line to it.
2,not his best,"The movie was not very funny. All the best parts were in the commercials. Spend your money and tour time on something else. PS. I really like other movies of his like Borat, etc."
1,Really bad movie,"I really like some of Sascha Cohen's other films, but this one was just awful to watch. The jokes are so silly and the plot is just dumb. I could barely get through this boring film."
2,The Dictator-unrated,Just aweful! This movie was so stupid and a complete waste of time and money. Would never watch again and would NEVER recomend it to anyone!
4,The Dictator,"Really bad humor in some parts, the kind not many would laugh at. But it is supposed to be over the top and offend everyone, in a joking manner. Hey, if we can't laugh at this crazy world sometimes, then we are in trouble. Some real truths in the movie about the deceptions in the world that well, almost everyone knows now. Which is good. Some reality about how backwards some remote areas of the world are due to being isolated and in old beliefs, and obviously some things are meant to be overly dramatic and not real, just like our media and world news. But you really want to keep watching, it is funny, strange and, well, just ignore the really off parts, and enjoy this off the cuff view of things going on in the world. I love it when a movie has parts in it that pretends it does't know about, but are in your face truths, like this one does."
2,"Review of ""The Dictator""","As a fan of the last Cohen project I was eager to see this movie. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. As expected with this genre and director, there were several genuinely funny scenes. However to much emphasis and time was given to silly, sophmoric and, indeed, middle school humor. Big waste of time and money."
4,Pretty funny movie,"Pretty funny movie. The jokes are a little raunchy, but it was a funny premise. Irony is always funny with politics."
2,Slightly amusing,Typical Cohen. Tries to get laughs with outrageous obscenities. Mocks the typical middle eastern government image of brutality. I didn't laugh out loud once but it had its moments. Wouldn't watch it again.
3,Dictator pretty good.,"The new movie with Sacha Baron Cohen is entertaining, however if you are a Borat fan you will probably be somewhat dissappointed. The movie has it's moments though, and I would watch it a second time. I would have rather seen a sequel to Borat."
2,2 Stars was a stretch!,All the humor was in trailer - nothing left in the movie. I like Sacha Baron Cohen but this was his least funny movie!
1,What A Waste Of Film!!,"If You Enjoy Wasting Your Time On Watching A ""Crape Movie"" Then This Looser Flick Is Made For You. I Gave It One Star Because (0) Was Not An Option. This Is A Pure ""Junk"" Film - A 100% Waste Of Time!!!"
1,Big Disappointment,"I'm a big fan of Borat and Da Ali G Show. Bruno was ok, but this was really disappointing. Had a few laughs, but I actually fell asleep with about 20 minutes left in the movie."
5,SO STUPID SO FUNNY,"THIS DICATOR IS SO DUMB HE IS HILARIOUS!!! I DON'T CARE COMEDY ALOT,THIS 1 WAS THE BEST MOVIE THAT MADE ME HURT LAUGHING IN MANY YEARS,IT DOES HAVE INSULTS,WHAT DON'T!!!!"
2,Mostly un-funny...,"It has its moments, but this movie is just simply unfunny to me most of the time. I think Sacha's best work came punking the unaware while Ali G. Even Borat had a better run as a feature-length movie...it's all a matter of opinion of course...knowing what kind of his work I prefer, though, should help you know if my 2-star rating means anything to you."
4,The dictator review,There aren't too many new comedies out there that get a laugh out of me but I thought this movie was hilarious
3,ok,This movie was not as funny as I thought it was going to be. It was ok but I probably would not watch it again.
3,I am a FAN but.....!,"This guy is a comedy genius....now that he's well known across the map by now, he can not prank people anymore. He has to choose another comedy approach. He made a new character ADMIRAL...GENERAL...DICTATOR...ALAADIN! I saw the movie and it was funny but not Sacha's comedy field. He has the swagger to pull it up, but was kind of shallow....dry forced humor."
1,Bad,"The most stupid movie, not funny at all. Don't waste your money ordering this movie. Not funny at all. Not funny."
3,Movie was ok not great.,Product was excellent but movie was just OK. I received it very timely and price was OK.Blu ray dvd was in great shape.
2,Not very funny.,"Some scenes are funny. Totally, it's not funny.It's far away from a good movie.Also English is difficult to understand.Also image quality is not good."
3,The Dictator.,There are only two or three lines which will make you laugh. Stupidly offensive humor. See this only if you like wasting money.
2,ARG,"hard to watch; Peter Sellers would not approve of this Trash. SO far, SACHA is a one-hIt wonder:( PASS on it and Rent Taken :)"
1,not too good,"Didn't like the political viewpoint, I don't have to pay for that, I can get it on the evening news for free. :-)"
2,"A few funny moments, but too few.","The dictator of a fictional nation comes to the U. S., and his trusted assistant attempts to betray him. This comedy features the man known for Borat, and features some fairly distasteful moments. Sacha Baron Cohen has quite a knack for comedy, and as always, he is sometimes off, and sometimes on in this one. There are some real belly laughs in this one, but in between quite a bit of the humor falls flat. Some of the jokes in this movie were actually quite creative and original, but I just felt that too much of the film was trying too hard to find humor where there was none. Overall, I would say there are better ways to spend your movie dollars."
1,The digital copy does not work,They were clever not to disclose that the digital copy was Ultraviolet. Have yet to have one work---total garbage. I should have purchased from iTunes. Only purchased to get digital copy and it doesn't work. Buyer Beware
1,Waste of time!!!,This movie is horrid! We didn't even finish iended the torture after 20min and bought a different movie. Absolutely stinks!
2,Didn't like the unrated content - bits lasted too long,"I stopped watching and scanned through it. The theater cut was better. The funny parts were extended way too long and were no longer funny, similar to SNL."
1,Ugh,Stupid. Just stupid. What a waste of money and time. Don't bother if you're over the age of 7. Make that over the age of 5.
4,Funny,I'm not sure why this movie has so many one star reviews thus far. If you're a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen's comedy then you'll definitely enjoy this film!
2,Meh!,"Slow start, sort of funny after 30 mins but still not that funny. It was a lot cheesier than I thought it was going to be."
3,Bad But Funny,"I went to see it to the teathers and I found it really bad, I mean, in a scale of 10 11 but it was peeing-in-your-pants funny, literally I went to the bathroom inn the cinemas because of the fun.I still haven't got my Blu-Ray but whenever I get it I will review the quality"
3,Lost the edge,"Sacha Baron Cohen's comedy has been absurd, shocking, disgusting, ridiculous, and lots of fun. That is, until this release: The Dictator. It's obvious from the moment the movie starts that ""the suits"" got involved in its making and that's never a good thing. There are many scenes that are just empty of any interest. I can almost feel Sacha restraining himself to please the board members.Sacha needs to keep total control over his productions so that they may blossom into the awesome sick spectacles they can be.I still recommend seeing it. Just be warned there are spots where the fail is almost painful."
4,Great movie,"Great Cohen movie. Don't have much else to say. You either like them or you don't. If you do like them, get it. If you don't like them, don't get it."
2,Still Not there,It was better than the first one and funny in some spots. But not a solid movie yet. Plot a bit weak.
3,disappointed,"this was just stupid, and i like stupid movies, but this was below Mr Cohen's comedic abilities, in my opinion....was worth the 4 bucks, glad I didn't go to the big screen though"
2,Unconventional filmmaker makes Conventional film,Trying too hard to please the masses?Being so unfunny makes it borderline offensive.Sasha Baron Cohen has never offended me until now that he's made a stinker of a movie!Larry W
2,IT'S WATCHABLE BUT DEFINITELY DISAPPOINTING......,I know I'm a little late on the review of this video but I must say that I am pretty disappointed with the production of this movie. I realize that you do not watch a movie like this for Oscar-winning performances but I at least expected to laugh hysterically more than a few times for my money.I thought the parallels to current events could have been illustrated better.Perhaps my expectations were just set a little too high? Either way I will not be watching this movie again.
3,Not as good as Borat,It is another Sacha Baron Cohen movie so if you liked the others you will like this one as well.
4,Pay attention or you'll miss some wonderfully offensive dialogue,"This was the least crummy movie one weekend and I settled for The Dictator. Man, I was really surprised to find myself laughing out loud within minutes of its beginning. Lots of gags and a script that offend nearly everyone. Perfect."
3,More or less what I expected,"This film is typically silly,stupid Sasha B. Cohen stuff. There's a few laugh out loud moments, a little more nudity from the harem girls would've been nice."
5,one of the funniest,"You have to have a sense of humor to appreciate this movie. If you get easily offended by pretty much anything you're not going to like it obviously. In addition, it's also a very smart film that gets its point across."
3,"Funny but not as good as ""Borat""","I expected something really funny given all of the hype and my complete enjoyment of Sacha Baron Cohen's ""Borat."" I watched this film with my husband and two adult friends While we all spent the time pleasurable, we agreed it was not as funny as ""Borat."" Cohen started his film-making career with such an unbelievable film, that he has created a high-water mark for himself that he failed to reach in ""The Dictator.""The Dictator - BANNED & UNRATED Version"
1,Complete Garbage,"This is the least funny comedy I've seen lately. Borat was awesome, but everything this guy has done since is utter garbage. Not funny, not good or even acceptable in any way. But go ahead and waste your money on this anyway."
3,"It's ok, Borat was better!","It was just ok. There was one scene that was just over the top, and no sex was even involved. It felt very recycled. I was expecting much more."
3,always funny,"Always funny SBC, once again, touches many ""wrong"" subjects.Entertaining and with some great one liners. Definitely worth watching, but not necessarily a must-see movie"
3,Too scripted,"The thing that made Borat and Bruno so funny is that he interacted with real people with real responses. No matter how outrageous his behavior in The Dictator, knowing that the response was scripted takes away most of the ""charm"" of his previous movies."
4,The Dictator - a pleasant surprise,"I wasn't expecting to enjoy this movie and was pleasantly surprised. Yes, it is rude, crude, and often incredibly un-PC. If you are easily offended, save yourself the trouble and skip this one. If you enjoy ribald humour and razor-sharp wit, this is a must-see."
4,Hilarious,"I guess this movie didn't do very well in the theaters, but I thought it was funny all the way through - indeed, the best of Baron Cohen's work to date (aside from my all-time favorite the Ali G show). This was one of the funniest comedies I've seen for a long time."
4,"Chem, Org. chem and Math very useful!","I bought this cd-rom just 1 month before the OAT. It contains 3 full OAT exams that you can either take the full test or a specific topic(bio or chem). This cd-rom is very helpful for your OAT self-evaluation. However, I only found the chem/organic chem part and math part useful. The physics and biology part is good but some of their topics arent even in the OAT. The reading part is nice but since it's on computer you cant really pace yourself(the real OAT is on paper at this point) If you are looking for a complete OAT simulation, this is an OK option since there arent many OAT practice products out there. Good Luck"
2,Just OK for review,This CD was not very helpful in for reviewing topics on the OAT. It does not have any explanations for the questions. This CD is only good for practice if you are unfamiliar with the computerized test format.
3,"Good software, but very outdated appearance","This product does NOT work on Mac. The concept and questions are great, but the software appearance is Windows 95... very old and crashed on me a few times. Needs a refreshed/updated look. BUT at the heart of it, you really want a great prep product which means great questions. This product does have that."
1,Expired!,"I recieved this item and it was EXPIRED. it is not supposed to expire untill 7 months after purchase, and I recieved it only two weeks ago! I write my OAT in a week and now im stuck without any practice tests. DO NOT ORDER TOPSCORE PRO from Amazon!"
1,Not Helpful for me.,This CD was not helpful. I purchase a MCAT book off of amazon.com....it covers the same material but more efficiently!
2,Dictionary needs updating,"This is a useful dictionary that covers more words than you are likely to use in normal situations. Malaysians tell me that some of the translations seem to be to Indonesian Bahasa, not the standard Bahasa Melayu. A few English translations are to obsolete Malay words.Bahasa Melayu is a living language and may be changing rapidly. This dictionary was revised in 1991. The spelling of Malay words was standardized in 1996 by the Malaysian ministry.I have almost worn out my copy, but I would not buy another unless it were updated."
4,not a bad anime,"If you are a fan of cowboy bebop, trigun, or outlaw star then you will enjoy this anime."
2,Kids weren't interested,"I bought 2 of these toys for my daughters for Christmas, but they showed very little interest in them. It's now May, and they have barely played with them at all. Apart from the fact that the palace isn't really big enough for a full-sized barbie, it's also very flimsy.Seems like a bargain, but it's not. Too bad!"
4,Creating Minds,"This book examines the creative process by reviewing the lives of seven highly creative people. I enjoyed the seven mini-biographies, but the attempts to generalize from them seemed ponderous. Some of Dr. Gardner's generalizations seem overly broad, some don't seem to be universally true even among the seven individuals he studied, and in any case seven cases isn't enough to generalize from with much confidence.This book reminded me of Eric Erickson's biography of Gandhi, which I read years ago with great interest. Erickson's theories about the life cycle and how it applied to Gandhi's life were more satisfying to me than Gardner's generalizations.There is an excellent 1955 film (Le Mystere Picasso) that shows time-lapse photography of Picasso's work in progress. The film helped me to feel better about my own frequent revisions when writing. It is available on DVD from a French company, Cinestore.com."
2,Maybe/maybe not,"This book has an excellent chapter on injections. The rest of the book contains things you can typically find in your user's manual. If you are interested in knowing every single aspect of the GC, this would be a good book. If you are just trying to get the GC up and running with a new compound, this may not be your best bet. Too much information and not enough time to absorb it all."
5,Great Doc on Insects!,"If it's available, I suggest everyone get it. It's not as gross as you think.While Microcosmos remains the king of the arty insect videos, Alien Empire employs great cinematography, a sense of humor, and fantastic information. Some scenes, such as the butterfly flying and shedding it's scales in slow motion with the beautifully composed music is breathtaking.If only they would release it on DVD :^("
2,Sound errors,"This cd would have been great if it didn't have sound errors on several tracks.And I'm not talking about my copy (it's on all of them). For that reason, don't spend more then 10$ or try to buy another edition while waiting for an official release."
3,Not what what I expected but OK,If you already have Excell you don't need this. It just makes Excell a little more user friendly. It is a pain to use otherwise. A bit unweildy. I don't even use it anymore.
1,"Waste of Money, Pure Junk","This brush has absolutely no place touching a record. The brush bristles fall out and get into the grooves, not to mention the scratching caused by this products WAY too rough bristles, its just a cheap foreign made piece of crap. Its not even worth $5 let alone $25."
4,It works.,The brush definitely works as is stated. I sue the brush on ebery vinyl that hits my decks and it certainly cleans them. Four stars because after a few passes there is still some dust that remains.
5,Perfect for Quick Touch-ups Before a Play,This little guy picks up a surprising amount of dust from records that look clean. It folds up into itself for convenient storage and cleaning of the bristles (just swing it back and forth a few times). I use it quickly before I play a record and it almost always takes some dust with it.
2,"DAK Cleaner is better, much better","can use the Audioquest cleaner and still see particles and dust on the record. Followup with the DAK record cleaner demonstrates that the DAK product is superior. And less expensive to boot....sure the Audioquest does do OK, but nowhere near as effective as the DAK."
4,LP cleaner,"It is difficult to determine how well a device of this type works without a microscopic look at the record surface. It leaves no visible residue on the disc surface detectable by the naked eye. As far as de-staticizing a disc, who knows? At least it doesn't add any while sweeping."
4,Anti-Static Record Cleaner Brush,"I use this anti-static record cleaner brush before each playback session. It definitely limits the frequency of pops and cracks, leaving that sweet sound that takes you back to the old days when records were the popular medium. The sound may not be as clean as today's digital audio, but it certainly revives the life of any record that has been collecting dust over the years."
4,Gets the job done,I found this brush to work best when used on an LP spinning on the platter. Be sure not to press down to hard or you'll stop the record and run the risk of scratches.
5,Good Product,"Very good product for the money. Easy to use, Easy to store and looks good by the side of my Turntable."
4,Great Product,I use this very easy to use cleaner everytime i go to play a record! and it gets the record nice an clean with 99% of the dust removed!
2,Not worth it...masking tape is alot better than this,I have this brush and wasn't satisfied. It just pushes around the debris and does nothing. Then I bought the Hunt brush which actually works! Buy that product cuz it is really superior. Sorry Audioquest. Your cables are great though.
3,if you are not careful you can scratch your record,"If you are not careful the metal holder can scratch your record, the brush has very soft carbon fibers, if you apply too much pressure they will just bend and the metal will make contact with the record and you could end up scratching your record. I am giving it 3 stars because its not ergonomic, you have to hold it straight or else you will make metal contact with the record surface."
3,Does what it needs to do but wish it was heavier,"The brush works fine, it does what it's supposed to do- although I wish it was heavier. While it works alright, the brush just doesn't feel like great quality, it feels light and plastic-y. It works though, a little tedious to get the dust off but it does the job."
3,Questionable,"I am more familiar with the pad that one adds liquid to, to clean an album. I have used this brush but fortunately, my lps are in very good condition so I see minimal results from the brush. I can say that it does not seem to hurt them."
3,It works,It works It works It works It works It works It works It works It works It works It works So Stop Bother me with e-mails Asking me to sell your product for free
3,tiny little brush,"This came in the mail after I waited for three weeks. I was so surprised that it was this tiny little brush of carbon fibers with a plastic handle. It covers the width of an LP and does a good job of lifting off surface dust and grime.I wonder if I can use this with a disc cleaning solution. I had a discwasher years ago and it was substantial with a large wooden handle- this is very small, but I'll see how it goes."
2,RECORD COLLECTER,"THE VANNS COMPANY WAS VERY HELPFULL WHEN I RETURNED THE ITEM ,THEY REFUNDED MY MONEY PROMPTLY, YOU COULD NOT ASK FOR BETTE SERVICE."
4,Works very well but is over-priced,"This brush does what it is supposed to do. However, when compared to competing products I feel it is over-priced. I really prefer the older DiscWasher cleaning system. However, since the latest DiscWasher brush is now made in China from cheap materials it is useless."
3,It's ok I guess,"Noticed manufacturing switched from Taiwan to China. Brush head bristles are not straight like they used to be, but are bent and crooked in some spots. This makes the brush much less effective. Returned the first, got another one with the same problem. Hope they address this problem soon. Was a great product at one time. Quality is not what it used to be."
1,Not Worth The Shipping Costs,"If you are about to be stranded on a desert island and can take only 10,000 music CDs with you, this 4-disc set should NOT be among them. These are not the themes as you heard them and remember them. They are played, sometimes well, sometimes not, by a hired orchestra playing someone else's arrangements -- moderately close, but don't even think about the cigar. And, if you're planning on ripping these, be prepared to manually edit and re-type about 90 percent of the titles, as most tracks are labeled merely ""Main Theme"". Only if you are truly desperate to accummulate a quantity of music without regard to the quality, then, go ahead, buy this. My copy will soon be posted for sale on eBay--""Excellent condition-played only once, and that by mistake."""
4,Who Would Have Guessed?,"When television was invented what a big impact it would have on our society? Here I am reviewing a 4-disc, 100 track set of TV themes (and LOVING it!!). This collection is just the tip of the iceberg - truly wonderful in its span of both time and genres - arranging it in alphabetical order makes most sense.My personal favorites are the playful Monty Python's Flying Circus, the X-Files, Roseanne, Murder She Wrote, Knight Rider, the Addams Family and Cheers. But there is something here for every generation (my grandmother loves Northern Exposure and Lonesome Dove).There are some songs I miss on this CD (the Simpsons most notably), but perhaps they are being saved for another volume. This collection is a must have for the true TV addict."
2,Quantity Over Quality,"As a musician myself, I know too well that one of the most important ingredients in ANY performance (live or recorded) is passion. The recordings here generally lack the same passion and sheer drama of the originals. Much of the instrumentation has been reduced to a cheezy, thin, plastic synthesized replica. The performances are simply a watered-down lackluster version of the classic originals. If it were not for the sheer volume of tracks compiled here, I would have rated the comp only ""one star""."
2,midi and no words,"while some of the tracks that should have words do, others don't. The outer limits doesn't have ""we control the horizontal.."" and the A-team doesn't have the proper intro. Monty Python is also a midi remake of the orginal that doesn't have the cheep tinny sound that it should."
1,Feh.,"Face it, the appeal of TV theme songs is their familiarity. You know every sound in your favorites. You won't find any of that here. Some of these aren't even close to the originals. A lot are performed on cheap, lifeless digital synths. All of them sound like tired run-throughs of the music. There is no apparent interest on the part of the performers, so why should any listener be interested?"
1,WARNING - Preview carefully and make sure this is what you expect,"As stated by other reviews here -- these are NOT the original themes, but simply remakes -- and many are VERY POOR remakes at that. Preview tracks before purchase, and listen carefully. If you are looking for the original theme songs, look elsewhere.If, for whatever your reasons, you want something that ""reminds you"" of these TV them songs... I guess this is the collection for you.Buyer beware!"
3,Mediocre,The sound quality for this collection isn't much better than the samples offered by Amazon.
3,Some well known tv themes from the 50's to the 90's,Being a 4 disc set each about 70 minutes this covers some tv from the 50's with Bonanza and Bewitched to the 90's with x files and star trek deep space 9. It does a Fair job covering the shows listed. But they are remade versions and some sound not quite as the tv version did. Mostly due to the instruments are not dead on exact but they close enough some might not notice. They also made some of them longer then as heard on tv like murder she wrote didn't ever have almost 3 minutes of title sequence. As far as tv theme cds go this set does include quite a bit of stuff.
2,Doesn't work for me,"I got this scoop, figuring that because it had holes instead of ""slots"" that it wouldn't A. take too much clean litter with the clumps, or B. allow small pieces of broken clumps to fall through the holes. Well, it works great for A, but lousy for B. The holes are pretty large, large enough to let pieces of broken clumps pass through, which you then have to go back and pick out with another scoop or your hands (yuck!).The good: It has high sides, so is quite capable of holding large clumps of litter (or multiple clumps). It seems to be of a good sturdy plastic (doesn't feel ""flimsy"" when you use it).If you use a litter that clumps rock-solid, this should be a great scoop for you, if not, I wouldn't reccommend it."
4,Good daily reminder of spiritual focus,"I enjoy the thoughtful daily readings. While offering a spiritual perspective, each one is nicely written, with enough food for thought. It helps the mind to focus on the essence of life."
5,Streams in the Desert,Have enjoyed this devotion for most of thirty years. I just recently downloaded it to my tablet for traveling. Read it almost every morning.
5,Exactly what I ordered and wanted.,I will use this devotional in 2013 with two friends each of whom have the same book. We get together each month for lunch and discuss the previous month's devotions. Doing this for the last couple of years has brought us closer together along with a closer relationship with Christ since each daily devotion is based on scripture.
2,Streams in the Desert,This book is very fine for a deeply religious person. I wish it could have been less religious and more inspiratiional.
4,Streams in the Desert,"I bought it to read daily but find ""My Utmost For His Highest"" more to my liking, then gave this book to my wife who says she really likes it and reads it daily. Since my wife is a selective reader, I must conclude that this book is well written and factual as to content. Rev. rr"
5,Review of Streams in the Desert,"Amazing, relevant and inspired devotional- knitting together Gods word with meaningful life stories that bring the truth home to resonate with every believer."
5,Awesome devotional during tough times,My husband and I were given this devotional by a friend during a difficult time in our lives. Everyday we were encouaged and given strength to rely on the Lord and realize that tough times make us better Christians. We marked and journaled from cover to cover. We don't hesitate to dive back in when we need to. This particular purchase was so we could give to others. Note: the print is small so perhaps a large letter version would be better for those who might struggle with smaller print.
5,Christ Lives in this book and in the heart of Believers,"This book is amazing for the believers that want to grow with Jesus Chrst there Savior It adds to your Study of The Word of God( the Bible) Basic instructions Before Leaving Earth anyways if you wanna grow remember that you get to do these things like reading a proverb a day or a book like this and don't forget you get to go to church to fellowship, worship and hear the Word of God spoken for all people Thanks Tepreene"
5,Awesome devotional,This is one of the best devotionals I've gone through. I started it in January and am almost done. It's goes pretty deep and that's what I like about it. This one I ordered for a friend. I would recommend it to all.
5,NO HOUSEHOLD SHOULD BE WITHOUT THIS BOOK,"This is the best Devotional Book I have ever read! Every author, of this compilation, has gone through much pain and sorrow! There are many, many encouraging words in this book. I've given away dozens to hurting people and I will continue to do so. There will always be a need for this book! Are you suffering in any way? Get this book! Are you in a desert experience? The Water of Life you will receive from this book will bless you and give you HOPE! STREAMS IN THE DESERT will refresh every thirsty and weary traveler!"
5,Streams in the Desert: 365 Daily Devotional Readings,Streams in the Desert: 365 Daily Devotional Readings is a wonderful devotional book. The individual writings so often address a particular need an individual may have on that exact day.
5,Speaks to the emotions,"I had read the original version of this book since 1969 and have read the revised edition since 1997. It is always new, speaking to my emotions each day. I have given innumerable copies over the years and plan to give five more this Christmas. I highly recommend its daily devotional thoughts."
5,"Whether in prison in your mind or your body, this will help","There are many devotional books on the market today, but this has been the ONE that made my life not only tolerable, but liveable. It doesn't assume every day is wonderful. It assumes you are really struggling more than most. Every day you open to read those few chosen words that help you realize the choices you can make to survive another day...and be thankful for it."
5,Wonderful read!,"I'm following the day to day chapters, this is the one of the best faith enriching books I've ever seen. Highly recommended!"
5,Daily reminder of God's graces,A dear friend suggested this book at a time when I was going through some real challenges. It did indeed help me in those dark days. A huge bonus -- it is a joy in good days also. I have thanked my friend many times for suggesting this book and have in fact suggested it to others.
4,Very Inspirational Read,Great way to start your day. This is a great inspirational read. Gives you a thought for the day that is easy to understand.
5,Streams in the Desert,This is a marvelous devotional that is especially helpful during trials and tribulations we may face. I like to give it to those who are going thru difficult times. It is very very reasonably priced.
2,"good devotional, need not update","I have used this devotional for years, and wear them out or give to someone who is hurting and seeking.I was very disappointed with the update and the small print. If something is great you don't change it. I believe in keeping print at a readable size. print very small.I would not recommend any one to buy it."
1,awful,"I never received the book and when I contacted the seller to ask where my book was, I received no response. I still don't have the book over a month later."
5,Great book,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this book. In fact, I bought seven more copies, one for each of the women in my small group. This book gets me started in the right direction every day. It seems to speak to me personally. I highly recommend it."
5,Very Inspirational book,I saw this on the morning show with Robin telling everyone about how her grandmother had this book and gave it to her. I purchased two -one for my daughter and one for me. We have both enjoyed it so much as it gives you something everyday to encourage you with life's journey. I am planning on giving it for Christmas gifts to my friends as it is perfect for anyone.
5,Boers' Great Trek,An excellent first hand account of the Boers' Great Trek viewed from the British side by an eye witness to the events. A must read for anyone interested in South African history.
5,"Finally, original material for a Change!","I like her husky voice but her earlier albums had always been rather hackneyed. This time's a real Change! A refreshing, nice mix of fast and slow original compositions in a variety of latin, folk, R&B and pop. Backed by great musicians too.This time round, her voice doesn't always shine because it can sound a little thin, but her singing style and ernest emotions always save the song. I like more than half the album's 14 songs, so it's definitely great value for money!"
4,I think it's a great effort from a formidable artiste.,"Lovers was actually the first Babyface album I came accross and I think two of the songs in the album'You make me feel brand new' and 'Lovers',rank among his best ever.I really enjoyed them."
3,Doesn't come with a cable!,"I'm sick and tired of spending over $32,000 (before shipping) for a piece of equipment for my laptop, only to find that immediately after UPS rolls the crates up to my front door, I have to jump in the car to go to the computer parts store and buy a $3.95 cable!Other than that bit of frustration, this thing is ideal for me and my wife to scan recipes into for future use while cooking! I also like the array of blinking lights. They are cool. I kind of feel like I'm Spock at the console of the Starship Enterprise. I highly recommend it .. just make sure that you buy the cable before it arrives. Live long, and prosper."
2,sorry but..,"i really dont care what the heck it does, for 32,000, it must do dang near everything. it only stores data?!?!? i would pay $1000 dollars AT THE MOST for something like that. im sorry, waaaay to much."
1,Quite a letdown,"I'm not sure, but for some reason, I was expecting much more from this book. I'm not sure why, as most of the photography books that I have read weren't very good. Are there any exceptions? Sure--Barnbaum's The Art of Photography and Freeman's The Photographer's Eye, as well as (for basics) Ansel Adams' The Camera and The Print. But this book was nowhere near that level. I thought it would provide me with a much more nuanced understanding of exposure and, critically, how to manually expose images by reading light (and not using A or B modes or a camera's internal light meter). But this book's approach was much more modern, more high-tech, with almost all images captured either in an automatic mode (e.g., A or B) or with aperture or shutter speed adjusted according to the camera's internal light meter before taking a shot. This may be a useful book for a beginner, but IMO it offers very little to anyone else. Glad I only got this in digital form, so I can more quickly forget about it."
1,"Thick, Gluey Muck!","Don't let the beautiful cover fool you, this book contains dreadfully complex, dry text that confuses rather than enlightens. Unless you are enticed by topics such as, ""Interpreting the D/Log E Curve"" or ""Converting Log Density Ranges"" there are easily better choices. If you're looking for clarity - whether novice or advanced photography skill - buy Bryan Peterson's ""Understanding Exposure."" Its simplicity is effective and refreshing."
1,Thorough disappointment,"I wouldn't title a book this way if I didn't have the pictures to back it up, and these authors do not. The print (at least in my copy) is very poor and suggests that all pictures were taken on ISO 800 film or faster - but the captions state otherwise. If you are technically inclined, buy a proper technical book. If you are more interested in how-to's, buy another how-to book than this one!"
2,Good reading but not practical for me,"After using another of the authors' book ""The Black and White Handbook"", I was disappointed by this one; It's a lot of chaos to me. The redemtion of the book comes with the notes and ancedotes of the authors, rather than what the title would suggest."
1,"Pompous, Useless Drival",Written to obscure rather than illuminate. Effectively makes simple subjects seem complex. Skip this and buy anything by Ansel Adams instead.
1,"Chaotic presentation, technical, contradictory","This book is a departure from others I've read by the same authors. There is little flow or organisation to the material. Detailed technical info is presented, only to be often times refuted by the authors in a side-note as not of true value. Therefore I feel the only value in this book is in the authors' side notes, which are in themsevles often arcane."
3,"Good scientific explaination, but not practical","I think that readers will learn more about the scientific side of photography. I found that the chapter on films was very thorough. However, some readers may find this book confusing to read when they have to deal with all of these technical stuff. I feel that this book is not too practical for some."
2,Gene Roddenberry,"Too much of the interviewer is in this. I just want to know about Gene, not her. You gotta pick your way through to hear what he has to say."
5,Lawyers killed a great product,"Since we do not leave coffee pots on the gas or toaster ovens unattended, the TRO400 worked fine for us. No fires or safety issues. The spacemaker feature is critical for our small kitchen and now we can only buy countertop products. After 6 years of steady continuous and safe use, the broil control is shot but we cannot replace the oven. Thank you to everyone who does not know how to safely use their kitchen appliances. By the way, one can purchase the TRO400 for $175 on e-bay vs. B&D's original price of $40."
1,Rollin' & Tumblin': Bob snubs Muddy Waters,"Dylan covered the old Muddy Waters classic ""Rollin & Tumblin"", but changed a few lyrics and kept the songwriting credit for himself. Muddy was not well off in his life and I'm sure his family would've appreciated the royalties from this song -this album was acclaimed and Bob could've made a difference, but he chose not to. The music and most of the lyrics were the exact same. Come on Bob, live up to your standards - credit were credit is due!"
2,Serious problems abound in this text,"Two big problems with this text.1) The quality of the translations is often remarkably poor, as Prof. Toru Tomabechi demonstrated at length in a December 2000 article in the Journal of Indian Philosophy called ""Notes on Robert Thurman's Translation of the Pañcakrama."" He calls it ""disastrous,"" among other things.2) Like much of Thurman's work, the compilation suffers from a pronounced, unacknowledged Gelukpa bias. As Lopez demonstrated in his book ""Prisoners of Shrangri-la,"" (pg 266), 140 pages are devoted to the work of Gelukpa authors and 30 pages are devoted to all other schools combined. A more accurate (if less marketable) name probably would have been ""Essentials of Tibetan Buddhism (Gelukpa variety)."""
2,This is a toy,"For some reason I admitted that a canister vacuum should be bagless. Well this one does have a disposable bag. In fact the bag is extremely small, about 5 times smaller than the one in my old regular Eureka. If you intend to clean the floor in your closet this vacuum should be good, but do not buy it if you want to clean something larger. I had to send it back."
2,Narrow shoe,Cute shoe but way too narrow. I have regular width feet but I could barely squeeze my toes into the straps. I attempted to wear them one day in hopes of stretching them but that I was a huge mistake. I should really return them but I'm terrible at getting around to returns. Maybe I'll take them to a shoe stretch. Bummer deal.
3,"White Diamonds never disappoints, whatever size you buy!","Ordered this small one to keep in the half-bath for touch-ups. I am a ""one-perfume"" kind of woman, and this is my signature scent. I am not so pleased about the bottle--the little stopper does not stay in, and the bottle is so round it will roll right over (because of the large stopper making it top-heavy). The bottle rolled over and I spilled almost half of it in the seconds before I could grab it. So, not happy about the bottle, but live and learn and get the larger size next time. Same wonderful classic scent though!"
3,Battery life lame,"My phone was fully charged when I left work yesterday at 4 pm. I then talked on a call for 37 minutes. I did not do anything else. The phone was dead this morning at 7 am.It is dead every morning unless I remembered to charge it. It is completely usesless for morning commute business calls because it always dead and I don't always have access to a plug.I am also irritated that I have to keep car and wall chargers with me at all times. I have never had a cell phone die like this.I still like the PDA features in the phone. It is light, slim and fits in my front pants pocket. It is very easy to type and download email, check my calendar, news, etc. It is top-notch for managing my work and family life.Thus my only complaint is the battery. I would give it a five star rating but for this very big issue. I am now going to try to contact the kiosk vendor at Costco where I got it, Verizon and Motorola to see if one of them has a solution. I should not have to waste my time to resolve this."
4,Pretty happy with it so far.,"I have had the Q for about 3 weeks now and have played with it, installed apps on it, modified the home screen, read tons of reviews and forums on it and bought a screen protector for it.All in all, its a great smart phone with a few improvements to be made on it.- the media player is choppy at times and I will have to assume that this is a bug.- the system itself is a little slower than I would like but bearable.- the plastic casing just plain SUCKS. I will assume that plastic was chosen to ensure the light weight, however, I think aluminum is the way to go and is much more sturdy. For example the RAZR.- battery life is something of a challenge. even the extended battery will only give you about 12-14 hours with moderate use.Other than what I listed above, the phone is great and I am still fairly happy with the phone.TIP - Try to find any defects with your phone within the first 15 days. After that, VZW will give you a refurbished phone if you bring it in after 15 days."
1,shaky,I'm on my 3rd Verizon Q phone in just 2 months. The operating system appears to be unstable as well as the phone. Both the software and hardware appear to be untested. The other Q phones I've had both got to a point where they were unable to boot.The times when it is functioning it's ok. It checks your email for you and you can browse the web. The camera is decent.Now I will spend another 30 hours configuring my latest Q replacement. I'm crossing my fingers. If it dies again I will be looking at a Blackberry.
1,MotoQ's screen 'freezes' to where phone is inoperable!,"My wife had this phone for a few days, then all of a sudden, we couldn't get past the 'Verizon screen'! The system completely 'froze up' to where nothing could get it to operate and perform calls or other functions for which it was made. We took the phone back dissapointed. Apparently, judging from other negative reviews online, Verizon is having some issues with some of these phones! How they can release a product to market without extensive and relevant 'real world' testing is beyond me. This reminds me of so many 'buggy' and problematic versions of Microsoft 'Windows' being released over the years that made one's computer crash, freeze, etc.! Anyway, if Motorola perfects the 'MotoQ' in the future, we may look at it again."
5,perfect,"as a former treo user an now a q owner i have to say this is the best pda/phone out there. As a verizon employee i can say that this is the most stable pda we have. Of course there's always a few phones that are defective but overall this phone has had the fewest warranty issues out of any pda. For every Q that happened to be defective I can show u six treo's with much worse problems. It might not be as customizable but its easy to use, straight forward and works. As far as BT...so much better than any treo, motorola voice dialing is far superior. Phone has not frozen unlike the treo's which would freeze with a text message. As more software becomes available allowing more customization i think that this phone will be perfect. I also use a blackberry as my work line so i know my PDA's. Being able to view attachments and the camera puts it above the blackberry. If you want a good pda go with either the Q or the Blackberry. The Q still has a better phone though"
2,If it's from MicroSoft - it Sucks!,"I guess technically, this phone is pretty good (slim, large screen, shiny, bad keyboard - hey, three out of four isn't bad!). What impedes it is MS Pocket Windows, or however it's called: menus are illogical, things that were so easy to set up on my previous Verizon phone (LG) are either difficult or impossible. Most importantly, e-mail is not ""pushed"" to the phone - instead, you have to log on every time (sometimes you have to type the password, often the login fails for some reason, from time to time the service is not available etc.). Even when you manage to 'log on', you don't get complete messages, but just the snippets - if you want the whole message, you have to request the rest of it, with the same procedure as for getting the message list.The phone charges increadibly slowly if it's on while plugged into the outlet - I event thought it cannot recharge like that at all (wouldn't that be a great feature!). Very different from Verizon LG."
1,will return!,"copying this from another review ""I loved the idea of this phone. I ended up returning it due to terrible battery life. Also, there are many bugs in IE and the Email client. ""This is not a good phone. it brakes, its slow and if i have to turn it on and off one more time!Its just not worth it! Get a gmail account and a regular phone if you need e-mail that bad. This a first gen product that will one day work but right now 500$; what a waste. I paid 200$ and I think I got a good deal. It has wayyyyy to many problems and settings. One alarm clock? , msn only, can't hook up to your computer because windows xp does not know what it is, and other than that it a great phone and it will keep you working an extra 20 minutes everyday!Also you have to love mirosoft becuse thats all that works on this phone.DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE WILL RETURN JUNE 15 2006...OH, i order one on line and it came in the mail BROKEN! so i have had two :)"
1,They said it would do everything--NOT,"Just a short note to say that if you use AOL and/or ACT 2006 contact management software, stick with the communication devices you have. Do not buy the Motorola Q. AOL email is not coompatable with the ""Q"" and neither is ACT 2006(you can't download any database). This took me hours on the phone(with INDIA!) discussing this with Verizon, AOL and SAGE, the present owner of the ACT software. The problem is being worked on but the only advice I got from any of them was,""Just check back on our website occaisionally and we will post when the problem is solved."" I think maybe I should change to another phone company--YA THINK! Very frustrating as I spent hours on trying to like this phone. Very frustrating."
2,Taking Advantage of the Customer,"Our company just switched to Verizon which included getting Q's for people who previously had Treo's with another plan (Alltel). I had the Treo for 6 months and had a lot of problems with that.My main beef with the Q has nothing to do with the phone or it's functionalities. Rather, it's regarding the abysmal battery life of the basic phone. What company would put out such an absolutely useless battery? Then, God forbid you actually complain to them about it, they have the gall to admit the battery is crap then try to sell you the 'upgrade.' Upgrade? How about including the better battery to begin with and give the customer some value for his money?Motorola, Verizon, and other companies that tout the Q should be ashamed for putting this product - with this battery - on the market.We're gonna give this phone about another week and then consider sending the whole lot back and returning to the Treo.Shame on you Motorola."
2,Motorola Q - Don't buy,"Motorola Q Sucks. If you are a serious user of cell phone, then don't buy this. The phone is not good. That is the reason, Verizon has brought down the price from $199 to $79.Reasons why you should not buy this:I get the standby time of only 10 hours and talk time for just 2 hours. Where as Verizon claims that this phone has the stand by time of 212 hours and talk time for 7 hours. But, that is not true.Remember a situation like Sep 11 or Blackout day. If anything like this happens, then this phone will not help you for any reason."
1,"Terrible. Gave it a try for a month, went back to Treo","This phone looks good on paper, in person, and in my pocket, but it was a huge hassle to use compared to a Treo. First, everything runs sluggishly and it takes a long time to do anything. The Treo has less memory but runs much faster because it is better optimized, and more importantly, has a touch screen. With the touch screen, I can click on links, buttons, etc., even with my finger, which saves a lot of time compared to using the thumbwheel and arrowpad. Finally, the Q's battery life was terrible. I thought I received a defective unit so I had it exchanged...the second unit was just as awful. Finally, the Q's keyboard looks better and is bigger, but is harder to use -- the keys are harder to press and because the system is slow, sometimes keypresses don't register (while Windows Mobile is trying to catch up or something). I wanted to like the Q but came away utterly disappointed."
2,"Nice form factor, the rest pretty much sucks","I started out loving this phone, and the form factor & screen are definitely great. However, after using it for 2-3 months, I now *hate* several things about it:1) The keyboard. This is the second Q I've owned, and on both I've had keyboard problems (sticky keys that won't type, phantom keypresses when pressing the 4-way pad). Also, on the personal gripe side, I found the rounded keys less easy to type on than the flat Blackberry keys, but others may disagree on this2) Software. Sometimes the software crashes, like when I'm answering a call. Sometimes the buttons take me to the wrong app (again, this may be keyboard-related). In general apps can be slow to load.3) Battery. When in low-signal areas, the phone tends to run-down really quickly.4) Keyboard. Did I mention the keyboard is really baaaad??"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE,getting this phone was the biggest mistake ever. I have only had it 6 months and have had to get it replaced FOUR TIMES! none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly. its always one thing after another. and I'm stuck with the thing for another year!! X(
4,Has its weaknesses. here they are:,Phone quality is tinny- by that I mean choppy- weak. With the reccomended bluetooth it is even worse. Speakerphone is not as clear as I expected it to be. MP3 and streaming quality- not at all as good as the tmobile SDA (which is overall worse than the Q). The batter life is not great. Every time you shut a program you have to go to task manager and stop the application from taking up ram- weird.
1,Don't Do It,"I have used Blackberrys and Treos and I figured I would try the latest and greatest...the Motorola Q. Boy was I wrong. Sure it is slim and has good audio quality. But the battery is absolutely horrible. Maybe a day of standby. And now three weeks in, the device simply crashed. Now the hassle of getting it replaced......don't do it......."
1,Microsoft active sync behaves as would be expected from a Microsoft product!,"If you get this phone, plan on using all of your minutes on the phone with Microsoft trying to install Active Sync. It has very stringent requirements, none of which are mentioned on the site when you purchase the unit. I still cannot get it to work. Why Motorola would have hitched their cart to Microsoft's spur is beyond me. If you just want a really expensive unusually large phone that pretends to maintain your task, calendar and contact data, without actually doing so, then this is phone is perfect.[...]"
3,"When it works, its a good phone","I bought the Q in mid-july. By September 20th, I am working on my third phone. It had worked fined for about the first two months, then one day, it was powering itself off at random times. I sent it back and got a new phone, that within two days would freeze, not allow me to access email, and eat the battery in about half of the time as my first phone. I am on lucky number three now, that seems to work so far. Microsoft's active sync, does not sync contacts, photos, or calendar...three of which i use daily, which made transfer of information a not so fun task. Like the title says though, when it works, it's a great phone."
2,"Functional, yet glitchy","I bought my Q because I am on the go a lot and needed easy access to my files and e-mail. While the functionality is great on this phone, it is laden with glitches and therefore, I cannot recommend this to someone who cannot afford to accidentally miss calls because you were ending another function on the phone. The lag time between doing various tasks on the phone is too long. It takes several seconds after I hang up with someone for me to be able to get to another function. Also, my Q has a tendency to power itself off, then restart occasionally. I have checked into the settings on the phone and checked with my carrier, but no one seems to have an explanation. Finally, pulling information off the SD card is not as straightforward as one might expect from a Windows-based phone. In short, if I had to do it all over again, I would have stuck with the Palm."
3,Brazilian Songs in English or Native Language?,"This is a CD just for Murphy's fans, anyway. However, hurts me give only a 3-star quotation to the best, to the Master. This is just because singing in Portuguese should be restricted to 1 or 2 tracks as a ""curious or exotic"" track. Of course Murphy is glorious in English. Of course this is the same great jazz vocalist of this century end/beginning. Also Brazilian ensemble here is good though not brilliant. Note: This is to remind you I am a Portuguese Native speaker and a forever fan of Murphy music since his beginnings in the 50s."
3,"Nice production, nice Ivan Lins songs","I'm not a big fan of Mark Murphy, but I like this album for the Ivan Lins songs, most of them done in English. The title track and 'Velas' are the highlights for me. The backing by Azymuth, Claudio Roditi and an altoist whose name I forget is outstanding."
2,Mark Murphy in sleeping mood,Perhaps I'm the greatest Mark Murphy fan in Europe. But I can't believe my ears with this album.Listen to Mark singing in portuguese. It's terrible. Please Mark listen to a native singer like Marcos Valle the next time you've an idea to record a brazilian album. Where's the happy feeling in this album by the way? Left at Copacabana?
2,Was the best projector of 2006!,"I am the lead installer for a company that installs RealHomeTheaters, so hopefully my experience can be of some help.This projector has been on the market since 2006. There is newer better technology out there at better prices. Shop around. Consider the Mitsubishi HC1500 or the Panasonic PT-AX200 and be sure to read my reviews on them too.Hope this helps get your RealHomeTheaters off the ground!"
3,Great while it lasted,"I bought my HD72 (actually the 6800 at Costco) back in December, 2006, and put around 750 hours of bulb use onto it. It was fabulous while it lasted. Then suddenly it developed this problem where the lamp turned itself off after a minute or two. I did some net research and found out this was a huge problem with this model. A few emails to customer service and I gave up on the machine. It was out of warranty and they refused to acknowledge that this model is defective and take it back for an exchange. In the meantime, they have come out with a newer, cheaper model, so I junked the HD72 and just ordered an HD20. If it has just as good picture quality, and better reliability, I'll be thrilled."
5,Neruda is one of the most romantic authors!,Pablo Neruda has a phenomenal grasp on the beauty of women. His poetry has the power to really make me swoon! This is a must-read for all those women who think men can't be romantic!
2,A poor translation,"Neruda is great, no doubt about it. He even shines through in places here, despite these clunky and artless translations of his beautiful poems. If you really want to read a translation which retains Neruda's passion, try W.S. Merwin . Being a fine poet in his own right he has a light hand and a feel for words that is true to the spirit of Neruda's writings."
3,It picks up,"There are three sections in this poetry book; morning, afternoon, and night. Reading the 'morning' was very slow going for me. I had to put it down numerous times. But once you start in on 'afternoon' and 'night' is gets so much better. This wont be something I read again but I can understand why so many people like he's work."
2,there are better and more important Neruda books,"not one of neruda's favorite books to begin with, although there are some gems, these translations are not worthy of the original poems."
4,Great earthy poetry,"It's surprising to some (who call me grumpy!) but in my private time I love to settle down and read poetry. These ""100 Love Sonnets,"" written in the 1950's by Neruda for his wife, are some of my favorites. I like Neruda because of his earthiness (""You sing and your voice peels the husk of the day's grain..."") and his depiction of love in the middle of every day. This is not a love surrounded by fairies and cherubs. This is a love covered with dirt and sweat, of life and death, of getting up and of lying down. If your tastes run more toward `poetic' poetry (such as the English Romantics) you might find these poems too modern and rough. If you read Spanish there's a bonus here (or, if you're a Spanish speaker who reads English) as the poems are also published (side by side) with their original Spanish.Love dragged its tail of pain,Its train of static thorns behind it,And we closed our eyes so that nothing,So that no wound could divide us.Great stuff."
2,Not the greatest,"I've got to say, I was very disappointed with this book. I have Captain's Verses and The Essential Neruda, which had a couple of the sonnetts in it that I loved, but all 100 aren't so great! I also know Spanish and don't like the translations too much."
5,The Middleman: The Complete Series,Deliver was fast and product arrived complete. I love this Series it is brilliant and very funny. With the dusting of all sorts of Sci-fi genre sprinkled threw out!
5,Another Great Show Gone To Soon,"This show is joining my collection with Firefly, Defying Gravity and many other great shows that didnt go beyond the first season.I absolutely loved it! It took a couple episodes to get into it but it really just got better and better as it went. The humor may not be for everyone, however, I couldnt stop laughing and thought it was perfectly unique. I highly recommend it!"
2,Way Overpriced and Not All that Good,"Shallow, predictable and not worthy of price being asked. Really disappointed even in realizing this is a spoof comedy on super heroes. Acting was average at best and often poor. No character or plot development with surface dialogue and simple script. I never expected this to be a deep comedy but felt it was made for the average age between 10-12. I don't mean to offend fans of The Middleman but I just did not find this to carry the slightest bit of humor and maybe would feel better if I had spent around $10 for it."
5,Re-watchable keeper,"I don't collect many DVD's but this is a must have. This series is so funny, witty, geeky and exudes a love of comic books, sci-fi and weird science. It also has strong female characters who share screen time in meaningful discussion of stuff other than men.It is such a shame that ABC did not continue it or sell it to a network aiming at a less juvenile audience. I don't think they realized how much grown-ups (or college students :) would enjoy it. Let me put it this way - this is nearly as good as Firefly but with a more comic slant."
5,This was Firefly all over again!,"I started watching this show because the preview I saw looked mildly interesting. After seeing it, ....WOW! This is an awsome show.The writing was fantastic, the acting/casting was great, the premise was very cool indeed. Everyone I spoke with who saw the show, loved it. I can't believe they cancelled it; just like Firefly, a great show that was cancelled before it's time.If you are on the fence about it, I say definitely get it."
4,if you already know adilette...,"---------- you'll find 'em the same except that my first adilettes were much less slippery under my feet. the surface seemed grippier on my first pair (still got 'em...) . . .the new pair seems smaller and also gives me a little blister on my little toe. (i can't feel any abrasive or other reason that might be causing this ). i use the originals with socks and the new ones without, since they're slightly smaller . . ."
4,Extremely Comfortable,"I bought my first pair of Adidas Adilette sandals back in 97 at an outlet mall in Florida. I was very surprised to still see them around. Those sandals lasted for a good ten years. They were in pretty bad shape when my wife decided it was time for me to get new ones. My second pair of Adilette sandals have been a little disappointing. A couple of the white lines on one of the sandals started peeling soon after I started wearing them. The pvc upper also started cracking a lot sooner than the first pair I owned. My second pair of sandals look like my original pair, but they are not holding up as well. Despite these criticisms, the Adidas Adilettes are a classic sandal that are extremely comfortable and a purchase I would recommend."
4,Sandal Review,"Great sandal. Reminds me of when I was playing high school soccer and needed to let my ""dogs"" free after a tough game/match. They do the same thing now...great for wearing around the house during the summer and winter months since you can wear socks with them (when it gets a little chilly). Can't say enough about the original!!"
4,Comodas y de gran calidad,"Es un articulo de gran calidad por la gran trayectoria de la marca, ademas de ser muy comodas."
3,Not adjustable,"I virtually never review anything on Amazon except books. But this product has a serious deficiency. One cannot adjust the strap that fits across the foot. In my case it is way too loose. My foot is long and thin. The product seems to be well made, other than the assumption that all individuals have the same dimension around his or her foot."
3,The spark is gone,"I found this season rather a disappointment. It strongly tends to melodrama and most plots are very predictable and transparent from the beginning. The characters as often as not act out of character. All in all, the spark has petered out. Besides, for some reason this season is much shorter than previous ones (3 disks with 4-5 episodes each)."
2,Video Quality Review,I began watching this video on my 22 inch computer screen. It was very low resolution and blurry to watch. Worse video quality than netflix or any other online video service I've used. I like the show closer and don't recall seeing an episode I did not watch through. However after about two minutes of this I quit watching it.Last time I buy online video from Amazon if this is what you get for quality. I don't recall what I paid for this video but I'm thinking it was probably too much if I paid more than 50 cents and I'm sure I did.
2,"closer,6th season",received this item in just a few days but have not had time to watch it yet. will let you know when i have time to watch it.
5,Great Show,Grand Show - Can't wait until next season is released on Amazon Prime - a little confused because it looks like some of the episodes are not there.
4,love that closer!,"Kyra Sedgewick is really great in the ""Closer."" I will miss this show once it stops production. but then nothing lasts forever."
5,Best show on TV!,"I am sad and disappointed that ""the Closer"" is no longer filming. It is an amazing cast and Kyra Sedgewick (Is that her name?) is brilliant. I am Southern born and bred and am always picky about Southern accents on television. She must have researched for years on this character. She has the Southern way down to an authentic art. The stories are awesome and I cried at the last season. It is good clean and smart tv. It is nice to see a show you can enjoy for being clever and meaningful without being weirded out or have bad dreams. I love this show. I started on Amazon and watched for a couple months straight through. (In all truth, it was way less time than that. It's embarrassing how hooked I was. Every free minute, I watched it. You will love it!"
5,What a great show!,The best part of having Amazon Prime has been the opportunity to watch all the seasons of The Closer. What a great cast!
5,Excellent Series,Never missed a show if possible. I am glad to have the series on hand for re-watching. All interesting characters.
3,60's music,"Cool Jerk is a great song, but unfortunately the rest of the cuts on the cd don't measure up - they're mostly not so great covers of soul classics. This would have been better in a compilation of other 60's soul music."
3,Body Focus 3 Workout Is Good,"The Body Focus 3 workout is good. Even though it doesn't have famous people in it, the tape shows how to get a good weight workout."
5,Perfect Union between Herbalism and Shamanism,"This is one of the few books that wonderfully joins the earthy world of herbalism with the spiritual world of the modern shaman.There are so many little herbal books around today,that have been watered down from Nicholus Culpepper and even Earl Mindell's later writings.This book gives the human ritual use of the herbs of Nature here perfectly.I can only recommend this book for modern herbalists,who want the deeper spiritual connection between oneself or a coven and the surrounding elements of Mother-Nature."
2,In need of editing,"As a two-time graduate of the University of Maryland and a rabid Terrapin fan for 25 years, I desperately wanted to enjoy this book. It does contain lots of information about the development of athletics at UM from the beginning to the present. But it needs a thorough editing/proofing. There are far too many repetitions, lapses, confusing passages, and grammatical errors for a book that made it to print--enough that they detracted from my reading experience. For example, the author sometimes refers to individuals by last name long before ever identifying them by full name and role, leading to the question of ""Who is THAT?"" All-in-all, this one was disappointing. Go Terps!"
4,Exciting and action-packed,"I've just finished reading BLACK RIVER and must say that Mr. Cucarese has done a very good job on his first work. His portrayals of the murders in New Hope make you feel like you are viewing the story first hand, and the chase in Trenton is pure nonstop action."
1,black river,"just finished the book. I found it to be too slow. The story just could not keep me interested. Do not recommend this book at all. If this is the first book, it probably should be your last!!!!!"
1,Tired and Board,"This was the absolute worst book I have ever read. I got real board, the author was not really focused when he wrote the book maybe he should try something else because this does not seem to be his calling in life."
5,nice solid construction,i got this knob because i drive a stick shift. the knob works great. it smoothly rotates and i've had no issues.then one thing they could improve upon is the screw. it looks like it will easily strip. it's an allen head screw but the octagon looks close to a circle. fortunately the allen wrench that comes with it catches the grooves....for now.and i wish i could have picked my color.
2,Somewhat disappointed,"Even using the shims provided, it was difficult to get a tight grip on the steering wheel. The bolt snapped off at the head when trying to tighten it sufficiently requiring me to find a replacement bolt."
2,Not what I thought I was ordering.,"I was looking for a red Good Vibrations 120 Easy Rider Mower Steering Knob. I thought that I had found it. The picture was of a red one and there was no choice of colors to pick from. When I received it, I had been sent a green one. I guess that they just send whatever they need to get rid of. I wish I had known. I had passed on a green one that cost less at a store where I live. I wanted to get one that would not stick out like a sore thumb on my mower. Rather than go through the trouble of returning it, I will give it to my son-in-law. His mower is green. I learned my lesson. I found a red one at a Sears store in the mall."
5,So much easier,Really takes the blisters out of handling a lawn tractor. Bought one for my brother in law too
3,difficult to install,this spinner can be very difficult to install.but once you have it on it works great.dont you wish you could meet the engineers who come up with these ideas?the trick is that the threaded cylinder where the screw goes revoles if you put a nail or something in the hole to line up the screw you can get it on.I put it on a new craftsman mower and found i had to take it off and put the largest spacer.so dont even bother with the other one.you can use a piece of clear tubing or hose if it wont snug up all the way.
1,Color,"The color of the steering knob was not the same as they one in the picture, the picture was red and the one that came in the mail was a weird green."
4,handy dictionary,"very good product, It is not for professional linguitics, but certainly it's very handy to have at home. I'll recommende it ."
2,Classic Star Wars: The Early Adventures,"I was less than thrilled by this book. Being a fan of the first volumes of this series, with the amazing artwork of Al Williamson, this installment was quite a let down. The storylines were adequate and it may fill a void for diehard Star Wars fans, but the art was less than amatuerish. As somewhat of an artist myself, I personally feel that the artwork in a comic can either make or break the book and this one was definitely broken. If this doesn't bother you than buy away but be warned that you will end up with a product that looks as though it was drawn by your 7-year-old brother."
3,Blackhole troopers first time ever,"This comic turn the Special Operations (Blackhole troopers) into one of the oldest Expanded Universe characters. Those ""black stormtroopers"" are going to be part of the new Star Wars video game Force Unleashed, so, if you want to know their background read the story."
4,A concise collection of important Buddhist works,"Conze's book represents a good introduction to the Buddhist tradition by utilizing translations of a number of important works covering a broad range of topics, from the Legend of Shakyamuni Buddha to an excerpt from the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Completely comprehensive it is not, but then no single text could ever hope to cover the entire spectrum of the tradition. It does, however, present the beginner with a good introduction to Buddhist doctrine and exposure to some of the most important Buddhist literature available in English translation."
5,perhaps the best introduction,"a nice introduction to Buddhism using a selection of sources instead personal expositions. Penguin has another one of Donald S.Lopez with same title, although the Conze selection is more representative. The little size make this book a perfect company for infinite readings in any place."
4,Nice collection of various Buddhist writings.,"Like any translation should be, this book reads as if it were written in English. More than that it is superbly written as well. It begins with stories of the Buddha's past lives, then a short rendition of his life. It follows with selections covering the three doctrines of Morality, Meditation, and Wisdom. And closes with some other writings including a short clip from the Tibetan Book of the Dead. I actually enjoyed reading this book more than the Gospel of Buddha, and would have given it 5 stars had it maintained its grip consistently. It also includes selections from Dharmapada, the Buddhacarita, and the Questions of King Milinda."
2,The Kindle Edition is not a collection of 3 stories.,"Please be aware that the Kindle Edition of ""Borders of Infinity"" is not a collection of 3 stories, but rather only the novella ""Borders of Infinity"" itself. Nothing wrong with that, but I was under the impression that I would get ""Labyrinth"" which was the story that I was looking for, so I returned the book."
1,NOT AS DESCRIBED!,"I purchased this e-book for the 3 novellas it was supposed to contain. IT DOES NOT INCLUDE ""THE MOUNTAINS OF MOURNING"" OR ""LABYRINTH"". This is the first time I have ever been disappointed with a purchase from Amazon.com. If you just want to read ""The Borders of Infinity"" then purchase this e-book, but don't expect to receive the other 2 novellas. Amazon.com did offer to let me return the e-book, but made no offer to provide the missing 2 novellas."
3,more a collection than a novel,"This wasn't my style because of the structure. It consists of several ""adventures"" like long short stories, butted together as Miles muses while recuperating from his latest.I want more continuity and more essential connections between the parts of the book.Still, as a short stories collections go, it was fine."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A collection of three novellas, a couple of which came from Analog, and another from a book. This is taken none too seriously with a Miles under investigation for accounting irregularities linking sort-of-story.Borders of Infinity : Borders of Infinity - Lois McMaster BujoldBorders of Infinity : Labyrinth - Lois McMaster BujoldBorders of Infinity : Mountains of Mourning - Lois McMaster BujoldUndercover recover uprising bustout.3.5 out of 5Werewolf nookie rescue.3 out of 5Infanticide investigation experience.3 out of 5"
3,Is this a reprint?,"The product description sounds as if this is a short extract from a much more complete book, published a while back. But not enough information given to determine is this is so, and I am not willing to spend the money, just to see if it is something I have read before. Yes, I admit this is the high crime and misdemeanor of reviewing a product I have not seen."
3,Great Novella But Not The One Most Reviews Are Talking About,"There is some confusion by most commentors due to Ms. Bujold writing both a novella and a larger collection of stories with the same name. This particular 3.99 ebook is just the novella and does not contain either ""Mountains of Mourning"" or ""Labyrinth""If you are looking for the larger collection you can find it here: http://www.amazon.com/Borders-Infinity-3-novella-collection-ebook/dp/B0062CKP2S/ref=cm_cr_pr_sims_t"
5,Recommend series,I have enjoyed the whole series and have recommended to several family members and friends. If you enjoy family sagas this is a very enjoyable series.
4,"Good, but short","Wish I knew that this part of the series, was in a three part volumne, I would have gotten the bigger book"
5,"Worth every penny, and more, much more","This no non-sense approach to improving your posture is informative and crystal clear about what to do and how to do it. In the set, the first DVD is packed full of exercises clearly demonstrated and explained. The 2nd DVD is an exercise routine that is easy to do and perfectly timed so that there is no wasted time. It's an enjoyable and vigorous workout. You'll be glad you bought either of the DVDs, or the set. I bought the set, and am very happy about my purchase."
4,What a pleasant surprise! Gentle and effective.,"I am a twenty-two year old, and in decent shape. I bought this DVD because I have always had a weak upper back and shoulders and thought this might do the trick. Upon receiving the video, I watched both discs and was pretty disappointed. I thought ""Most of these exercises are done in a chair. How is this going to do anything?"" Not to mention, typically I hate using resistance bands. Furthermore, the abs section was simply breathing!! Still, I tried the exercise disc anyway... and WOW!!! I was surprised. My upper back and shoulders were sore for the whole week, but I felt stronger. I felt an improvement in my posture as well. But my favorite part? The ab routine! It is phenomenal and simple! I saw and felt a difference immediately. The day after I did the video for the first time, three people told me I looked much thinner. That's gotta count for something! Overall, the video is slow, but it is gentle, effective, and in some ways unique. Good buy!"
3,Not for Yogies,"I can see how this DVD can be useful for someone who has a desk job and perhaps is in the office all day. The DVD contains exercies for each and every part of your body and many of these exercises can be done right in the office whenever you have a few minutes. However, for someone like me who does yoga everday and has done so for years, these excercies do not provide much additional value,and I find the DVD and the exercies boring. I will not be using this DVD. I will pass it to a friend with a desk job."
3,Gets the job done,"It does give you a good work out, as long as you are doing it correctly. My wife was surprised on how effective a workout it was. The instructor explains the movements & what it is doing for you. The only negative is that it is very boring."
1,Nothing new- old stuff; would not recommend,Go to a couple of good balance yoga classes or buy Mary Bond's New Rules of Posture instead of wasting time and money on this poor old DVD
2,"posture, get it straight",It wasn't what I thought it would be. I guess I was hoping for more neck alignment postures and sitting postures and even bending postures to keep your spine in the right allignment.
5,"Posture, Get It Straight","I bought a while ago, for my daughter who has fibromyalgia. It's been such a help to her I got the new two DVD set for myself. I'd only used it a few times when my mother asked me if I'm losing weight. Thanks again, Janice Novak."
3,I like..,The video presents a series of exercises with a yellow colored band is supposed light. The video comes with a blue band that is stronger which makes the exercises more stressful. exercises are useful but limited in number only abdominal breathing and muscle contraction but does not place the person in a mobility exercise to strengthen practice. Only contraction is merely to be generated voluntarily. The alineacios of pelvic posture is essential exercises have not seen here in the video showing exercises to correct the alignment. I wish you much further in strengthening the entire back perhaps with the incorporation of light weights. In general terms good video for a home office or sitting at home.The music make me nervous.
1,That's my worse purchase ever!!!,That's my worse purchase ever! I bought the same part (left side) from the same seller and it was good. The quality of this part is terrible. There was no reason to replace it because the old one is in much more better condition than the new one i bought! I'm very disappointed. I'll try to attache photos of this item to avoid other people from buying it!!!It doesn't deserve even 1 star because it just a crap an it is useless![...]
5,Great Film!,"Into Great Silence (2005) Starring: The Carthusian Order Director: Philip Grning is a film about the Grand Chartreuse an ascetic monasteries in the French Alps. This is a documentary about the Carthusian order, their daily prayers, tasks, rituals and life styles. A wonderful chronicle of spirituality you must see."
1,Into Great Silence,"This was a total disappointment. As the info states:""no score, no voiceover and no archival footage. What remains is stunningly elemental"". It was very boring to watch with no sound, no talking, seldom did one view a person. There were many aspects of the monastery that were filmed, but you were left wondering:""What was that?"". Rent it and don't waste your money buying the set. Very poorly done - a true disappointment."
5,Into Great Silence,"This is a very moving film, a spiritual experience. This nearly three hour tale of life in a monastary, with no narration, seemed like a short film. I have now seen it twice and look forward to future viewings ."
3,left sensible but unmoved,"This film shows with some success how the worldly-abnegation of the Carthusians results in an ability to meditate beyond the common place of everyday prayer. One could argue a film need not do more than that to say something important. I did feel the sense of absence in these people's lives, and their discipline as means to suspend their humanity in a kind of holy iteration of metaphysical intuition - well beyond piety. I felt also however that this way of life as practised by Carthusians, would come across regardless of how they were depicted. Unfortunately you have to make a film which is equal to them in order for their experience to be shown as equal to itself. Groning can't do it. He resorts to simplistic, even sometimes banal, filmic techniques to try to give a sense of what these people are about and how they live. The fuzzy cam-corder scenes are particularly studenty and annoying."
1,Boring,"Unlike most of the viewers, I not only found this film extremely boring, but I often found it choppy and lacking in continuity. Nor did I sense from the facial expressions of the monks any sense of deep happiness--such as interior joy, peace, freedom, strength, or even love of God. They appeared to be performing their activities rather mechanically, robotically instead of with the blissful devotion and appreciation that comes from exclusively and daily serving God with one's whole heart and mind."
2,The Most Memorable Film of the Year,"Not knowing what to expect, I was totally overwhelmed by the beauty, quiet and attentiveness of the many aspects of Carthusian life in this film. The camera approached La Grande Chartreuse, the monks and the extraordinary Alpine setting from the inside making of it a stunning, intimate, impressionistic cinematographic masterpiece. I saw the film twice and enjoyed it even more the second time. And I plan to see it again!"
3,. It was OK,"It was beautiful, but overall not terribly engaging. The photography was spectacular. I loved learning about their lives, but I could have stopped watching after about an hour."
1,The story is not told well.,"I understand why the style of film making was chosen, I just think it was unfortunate. I like documentaries and such, but this could not hold my attention."
3,does not play on dvd player,my 2 disc copy of this item does not play on my Jvc dual vhs and dvd player. other dvd's which i have do play including those i get from Netflix. THis set does play on my computer but still will not play on my dvd player which i bought in 2003 and is a jvc. i have contacted the seller to find out if other clients have commented on this but have not yet rec a reply. any suggestions are welcome. i prefer watching on my dvd player so i can watch it on my tv. It is a region 1 dvd. [...] i just stopped in an electronics shop today and they said to clean my dvd with a dvd cleaner stupid me i never heard of this i thought dvd's were laser and did not have to be cleaned nor cd players cleaned like tapes i bought the cleaner disc wish me luck will let you know kirk
2,Plan on squaring it before use!,I have had experience with two of these and both were less than square out of the box. This meant they were not on the same plane as the stone's top edge and sharpend planes and chisles at a slant. I fixed mine by placing it in a bench vise and pulling on the arm until square as measured with a large carpenter square. This solved the problem.
1,Shipped wrong item twice,"I'm not sure there is a newer revised addition of this book from June 2011? I ordered this book, and got the 282 page version. Customer service resent the book and again I got the 282 page book (instead of the 316 page version this page talks about).Customer service was helpful, but don't bother ordering this book at this time - order the 282 version for $2 less."
3,Price is reasonable,"This book has some great survival tips, but is geared more toward building with architectural plans. Great for the guy that wants to build."
5,"A ""Knight"" Worth Keeping...",I loved the third book in the San Rimini series. THE KNIGHT'S KISS is such a sweet tale of sacrifice and love and magic spells ... I didn't want the story to end.Ms. Burnham is so talented! She's created a wonderful world that I loved to be immersed in and I hope she finds ways to write at least a dozen more books about San Rimini and its royal family. Aren't there cousins somewhere? :-)
3,Red Enamel Heart Earrings,These earrings are cute but they are really tiny. Much smaller than I thought they would be.
2,too tiny,"even though measurements are posted in product information, I was still surprised at how small the earrings were. Nice, but appropriate for a child."
5,very fast shipping!,cute earrings exactly what I expected to be and the shipping was super fast as well!
4,Regency love stories,"This is a competent collection of 4 novellas with the romantic historical setting, innocent heroines and the rogues that captivate them and win their hearts. I prefer my love scenes on the more spicy and sizzling side, but this should still please many readers of this genre."
1,Only good story was Enoch's,"Not good. What has happened to Julia? Sir Phillip was not good. She has changed her writing style. Throw in some sex like so many of the poor authors, dime a dozen, just doesn't make a worthwhile read. I like emotion, depth, relationship. Julia used to write that. The better authors can and do. I give Suzanne Enoch a 4 star though. There was story, tension in her novella. But otherwise a waste of money and time."
5,Love it!,"I am attached to this series of books. Yet I am leary of 4 short stories written by different authors who would not normally write this series. yet I found the book delightful, each of the four stories related to the next and it was a book in itself. the three writers worked very well with the author of the original concept. Very entertaining, I recommend this book!"
3,Ok read,All of the stories were ok reading but they all lacked one thing (LOVE SCENES). If you like a little spice in your readings these are NOT for you!
3,Very entertaining!,"Someone gave me this foo foo book. I never read Regency stories but needed a change after a really serious read. I found it delightful. 4 different authors; 4 stories intertwined and nicely done. My very favorite was the last, where Sophia's husband returns after 12 years. A bit of a stretch, but it could happen. It was a light and delightful read! Everyone lived happily ever after!!!!!! Mission accomplished. :D"
1,re ameroc opulence,we have not used it and would like to return. we switched to another product.What sould we do????? VM thanks
1,Collaborating : Finding Common Ground for Multiparty Problems (Jossey Bass Business and Management Series),Extremely dry. Reads like a thesis. I returned the book.
4,"Good, but not as good as number one","I get the idea that Dr. Forward just wanted to write a sequel. This book's premise is interesting - the cheela, due to their sped-up lifetime, have only one day (human time) for their earthling friends to figure out how to save them. I didn't like the characters as much and the story didn't hold my interest as much as the first book, but I still recommend it to fans of ""Dragon's Egg"" and those who love really scientific sci-fi."
3,Good but not as good as the first one,The book is good but is a pale book compared to dragon's egg (the first part) which is such an excellent book. So skip this one because nothing new is here. On the other side if you have not yet read Dragon's egg ...Don't hesitate any longer.
5,Star Flip Flops!,Love these flip-flops! They are so cute and comfortable. I get lots of compliments on them! And I never thought that I'd get compliments on flip-flops.
3,Nice design - cheaply built,"I bought this watch as a cheap look alike to my Tag Heuer for day to day abuse. Indeed it looks very nice and would go through as a much more expensive watch on first sight. The blue color of the face is beautiful, the bezel doesn't turn though. It's a feature I never use anyway. The crown is not screw down. You just push it in. I wonder how water resistant it is going to be long term. The pin, that holds the bracelet is way too weak though. One evening, only about 2 weeks after I got the watch, the whole thing just fell on the floor out of nowhere. I had not even stressed the watch. I read about this weakness in several other reviews and can confirm it. So far I didn't put in a claim, so I'll see how that goes. Overall a very nice, more expensive looking watch with some flaws. At less than $120 it seems okay."
5,Don't miss out!!,This is a great looking watch.I received one as a gift by my wife and have enjoyed it's casual and yet formal look for several years! It is also a fully functional chronograph that keeps excellent time.Enjoy!!
4,"Good looking, with some flaws","I think mine is one bought just before the eco-drive thing picked up, because I do not have it, yet this is the exact watch I have. The face is nice, though the chronograph is a little annoying and, in my humble opinion, just there to look good. It has been fairly accurate and the stopwatch has always functioned well on mine. The band is thick, but not uncomfortable at all. All-in-all it looks nice and works well.My biggest complaint is that a few years ago the band-pin came loose and was lost. Since then several jewelers have replaced this pin again and again. It never seems to hold as well as the original. I think the band's heft is stressing a typical pin too much. I am finally tired of it and moving on to another watch."
3,"Bezel doesn't rotate. Overall it wears a little stiff (due to fat links), but good looking.","Bezel doesn't rotate. Overall it wears a little stiff (due to fat links), but good looking."
2,Could be better.,"I own three Citizen watches, ranging in price from $400 to $129, and have been extremely pleased with them. I bought this one to give as a gift, and it does not reach the same standard as the others I bought. I guess for the price it is reasonable, but it just feels... cheap. It reminds me of Fossil watches-- extremely heavy bracelet, chunky, etc. In fact, you can get a nicer Fossil watch for the money you spend on this one. Looking at the picture, it seems as if the bezel would turn, as on many watches-- but it does not. This is the first time Citizen has let me down."
1,"Nice looking, but a poor watch- loses time","I bought this watch exaclty one year ago (Nov 2011), I started noticing in Sept of 2012 (less than a year), that I started losing 7 minutes every month. A watch is no good if it can't keep time. Very dissappointed in purchase. I attempted to return to Amazon with no luck. I wish I could get my money back. DO NOT PURCHASE IF YOU CARE ABOUT BEING ON TIME."
5,Love the watch,I have had this watch for two weeks now and love it. It has a good weight and looks beautiful with the blue face and the three internal dials as well. You can use the second hand as a timer or let it sit still on your watch and use the tiny second hand dial on the lower of the three. The watch is smooth and does not snag my arm hair or my clothes.
5,Great Product!!!!,"This item came fast! The watch looks great! You would pay more in the mall for this watch. In addition, you do not have to buy batteries for this watch. I really enjoy this watch!!!!"
4,sanchez: #1 dub,"it's surprising how well tracy chapman songs lend themselves to ragga-style dub! sanchez pulls it off with style. i usually prefer old-school dub and reggae with real drums and bass, but i made an exception for this record. solid, clean, easy to mix. check out ""come to rule dub."" this recording also features harmonies by judy mowatt & marcia griffith--though i can't honestly recall hearing them in the mix, it does demonstrate good taste!"
3,Return to Opal Reach,"I have some collection of Scarlet series romantic book, including Return to Opal Reach. Reading the love story between the handsome Jarrah Kaine & beauty skye, with the cowboy land as the background, is the very romantic story. Jarrah Kaine always wants to become the strong & patient man, so that Sky will always love him as he does. He always wants to protect her as much as he can, until Skye have the feeling that he handle her like the invalid women. Deep inside Sky heart, although she love him very much, she thought that he marry her because of her pregnant.They came from the different world & different background. So they have to try to make it become one and no problem. Since they have the very deep love in their heart, finally they can be the happy couple together."
2,Games reading not so fun,"The book is a slow read, not very exciting. Since it is kind of boring, none of the games sound very intriguing."
4,A very instructive book. A rewarding lecture.,The book is a practical introduction to Number Theory and the exercises are gradual and accesibles. I will be pleased if in a next edition a diskette with the programs is included.
2,It took two days and broke,"I bought a 8 piece Deluxe attachment kit for my vacuum cleaner, and the second time I used the hose, it broke. I thing it is more than 30 days I bought it, so I cannot do anything to return it. SAD!"
1,"Not worth full price, but OK if you can get at a discount","There are some nice pictures in this book, and some interesting stories. If you can find it at a discount store, then it may be worth the purchase price.The writing style leaves a lot to be desired. It's as if the author did not know anything about firearms, and was writing the book using interviews and publications. The inaccuracies are plentiful (almost every paragraph), and some of them are amusing (ever hear of a .99mm?). Entire chapters are nothing more than a description of what is in the S&W; catalog.Reminds me of a travel book I purchased in Prague about 15 years ago. Has great pictures, but it was translated into English by somebody who did not speak English. The words may be English, but you can't read it because it makes absolutely no sense."
2,Full of Errors- a coffee table book,"this book, long awaited, is full of errors and mislabelings.. Contains very little useful collector infomrmation. A coffee table book for casual interest.No addition whatever to knowledge of this field.Best done without."
1,Very Poor Book,"Of all of the Smith & Wesson books on the market and I own them all, this is the poorest excuse I have ever seen. The text is not only juvenile in content but inaccurate as well. There are some excellent photographs, and as a picture book it's not bad. Just don't read it."
4,NOT JUST FOR COFFEE TABLES,"As a collector AND afficionado, this book and the Standard Catalog of Smith and Wesson will get me what I need. One size seldom fits all, and I believe it is unfair to expect such from a single book. This attactive edition provides interesting information, very nice photographs, and (particularly neat) two pages devoted to pictures of the TWELVE REVOLVERS and their engraving, AND an explanatory drawing of the triple lock system. There are other books for the deadly serious collectors; this is simply a nice overview with a lot of good stuff."
5,Greatest,i believe is a great collection although i am myself no great fan ....my late brother was and this is only one of the titles he owned and im selling all his stuff so if your interested in buying it email me i'll sell for 12 bucks my email is jiaijane@yahoo.com
5,An Epic Tale of Organizational Transformation,"When Charles Rossotti took over as Comissioner of the Internal Revenue Service in 1997 the IRS had more customers than any organization in America--and the lowest customer service rating. In Many Unhappy Returns, Rosotti describes how he led a major turnaround of the agency in spite of the extraordinary constraints he faced. Rossotti did an amazing job of engaging the career employees of the IRS at all levels while managing relations with key constituencies such as Congress, the National Treasury Employees Union, and the media. Rossotti demonstrated mastery of the big picture, but his strategic vision was informed by his regular encounters with front-line employees, who helped him understand the systemic problems that undermined employees' ability to provide great service to the public. This is an engaging read and a compelling story."
2,"Some information, but could have been much better","This book on the West Coast Trail provides an overview, but people interested in hiking the trail are better off just buying the map or getting free information from BC Tourism or the web. This book has some details of places along the trail, but is missing key information. For example, there is no information on the total length of the trail or how many days it takes to hike it. While various points of interest/camping spots are described and referenced on a small map in the book, there is no information as to the distances between these points. (The map also lacks trail mileages.) Why this information was left out, I do not know.On the plus side, there is some good information on getting to/from the trailheads and a couple of descriptions of other nearby trails."
1,Not an Audio CDRW,"This product is not as advertised. It is labeled an audio CDRW. But in fact, it does not work with CD Audio Recorders. Don't buy it if that is what you want to use it for."
5,Work great for me,I had bad experiences with the Memorex Music CD-RW discs I first used with my SONY CD Recorder. I bought 6 of these Fuji discs (which have the advantage of working for both data and music recording) and have recorded on all of them in excess of 20 times with nary a hiccup. I wish the CD recorder itself was so reliable.
1,Not What it was described to be,"The description for this product indicated it would work in a Music CD Burner. It did not! My CD burner is one that burns in real time and only uses MUSIC CD-Rs and MUSIC CD-RWs. The description of this product said that it would work for recording music and displayed the Audio CD symbol that indicates it's for recording of music. This is all incorrect. It might work with a computer, but it does not work with a Music CD Burner. I bought three of them in hopes that they would work properly and the shipping cost me more than the product. Therefore it was not worth it to return the product. I was extremely disappointed."
3,Pretty Nice...,"The vase is pretty, but the quality is moderate... When I recieved my vase, one of the butterflies was broken off of the vase. I was going to return it, but the maintenance people at my job tossed it out by mistake. Would I buy it again? Yes, but for $20 - $25, not for $40. It was pretty, it really was, but the quality could be better..."
2,Beautiful except............,"Showed up with one butterfly wing broken off, but still in one piece so I figured i'd just glue it back on. 1 years later and I think it only has 1 butterfly still on it. Others fell off with just gentle washing to take dust off of it. It sits in the garden window behind the sink. So it hasn't had any rough handling. Haven't been very happy with the quality."
4,Crystal Guthrie Loves Butterflies,This vase is gorgeous! The big blue butterfly has a few white specs on it's wing that should be blue like the other specs on it's wings. You can tell. I would have given it a 5 rating if this had not been so. I did not want to have to pay shipping and handling for sending it back and don't have time for that since this is why I ordered on Amazon so it can be shipped to me. I like looking at it. I am planning on a silk arrangement or just a lucky bambo arrangement to be placed in it. The color is beautiful.
4,A Journey Through Ravaged Ireland,"The Grave by James Heneghan portrays a young foster child, Tom Mullen, who does not know his origins and his family. He starts out in an abandoned department store and throughout his life, he searches for his own identity. He travels back in time to 1847 Ireland where he learns about his origins and his identity. With this interesting plot, this book was both entertaining as was as literary. The Grave had a good blend of fiction and non-fiction to create beautifully written historical fiction. The book was a fast-paced book; the adventure starts from page one and the author wastes no time fluffing up the introduction. The events and characters seem real because of Heneghan's vivid characterization and description. Overall I would recommend this book to anyone who loves reading historical fiction as well as someone who loves to read suspense novels."
3,good combtnation,"good combtion of histrocal fiction and sicne fiction, time travel in one book. the stroy is good to your really feel from and understand tom."
3,The Grave,"The Grave is a novel about a foster child who goes back a few generations in the past where he meets his ancestors. Throughout the story, the protanganist comes back to the present day in between where we explore in depth who this boy really is. Also, there is a theme of trust that is shared between Tom (main character) and his look-alike who is obviously his ancestor (sorry if i ruined anything but i thought that it was pretty obvious if you think about it.Although the plot leads to an obvious and predictable (even cliche) ending, it is still worth a read for readers who are interested in theses time travelling books."
2,Good but huge,This mouse is smoothe but if you have a small hand you will be uncomfortable using it. It is huge.
5,Works very well when not too full,"I happened to check the bag in my Sharp vacuum and found it was quite full but still picking up the dirt.Still, I changed it with a new one and was rather surprised to see how much better the vacuum worked with a brand new empty bag.So the lesson is not let the bag get too full just for economy's sake, and you will get quite a bit of improvement in performance."
5,Thank you very much for offering exactly what I needed.,"I saw a video clip of Dr. Snowdon that contained interviews with the actual nuns that he used in his study. It's amazing that he took a topic that is breaking a lot of people's hearts and bringing hope to millions of caregivers around the world. In learning about that he wrote a book about his research, I was inspired to buy the book. Thank you very much, Dr. Snowdon. Keep adding to the literature on this most personal and devastating topic."
1,Fabulous Icing,"Snowdon stands well on the shoulders of others, and he effects a delightful presentation of their findings. It's a terrible shame that he cannot connect to the women on a more respectable intellectual level. This inhibition prevents a more ""graceful"" presentation of the study's findings."
4,if you are a saw fan,"if you are a saw fan buy this shirt you wont regret it.on the front of the shirt is a picture of billy the puppet, and the back reads ""saw 2, oh yes there will be blood"". this is an awesome shirt, can't wait to wear this shirt to saw 4 coming out october 2007"
5,The best rip-off I've ever heard!,"This is a fun, fun, project. I'm 40 years young and love bands like SYM X, TNT, Vintage Yngwie, OSI, Masterplan, and others. This project is a great rip off of some of the best 80's bands... without ripping anything specific. They take portions of the sounds of Cinderella, Bon Jovi, AC/DC (Thunder), Def Leppard, etc; and put together great songs with an awesome production. The disc is eclectic with rockers, ballads, shreds, and screams. Some Blue Murder sneaks in too. Lots of stuff that will make you smile. The technicality and muscianship is present without being overplayed. If you loved 80's music and have kept current with what's out, you'll love this project. Definately a safe buy. Every song is solid. It's a little softer than I usually go for, but I love it anyway. After all not everything needs to rip your head off and leave you shaking on the floor, right? Lots of sites have rated it very high, it's great, happy rock-n-roll."
4,Buy just the tunnel.,"It is solid. Crank stands up to a 3 year old. Over-priced, but what Thomas stuff isn't. Crane is difficult to coordinate both controls at the same time. Tunnel is great. Personally, I would strongly recommend buying the tunnel separately. The crane isn't as great as I hoped."
5,Perfect extra closet bar,"I was looking for a way to let my toddlers learn to hang up their own coats in the ""do it myself"" stage. This was the perfect solution - high quality, easy to install, and inexpensive. The vertical supports are chromed steel that easily slip through holes in the wooden hanging bar, then simply hang over the existing closet rod. It was so easy my three year old did half the work; then she and her little brother were all excited about being able to reach their clothes for themselves.Whether you want a hanging rod to bring clothes in reach of your children as I did, or whether you just need the extra closet space, you won't regret buying this product."
5,Exactly what I want,Great product... It's exactly what I want. And I think it's the only store that ship products to overseas. It creates double spaces for my wardrobes. And the shipping is fast....
1,broken rod,"The wooden rod is a bunch of pieces glued together, so its not very strong and broke once I filled it with clothes. Pretty worthless."
3,"Not a Toy, a Tradition","When I had a knee replacement six years ago, one of my wife's colleagues gave me Herald (who is, after all, an angel) to watch over me in the hospital. Since then, we've given any friend or family member in the hospital a Herald with a card that we made up. People seem to welcome it, and we've heard from people having surgery that it was the last thing handed to a family member before being wheeled to the OR."
2,Disappointed very Dissappointed,This thing smells like sweet candy. It is not even close to the citris I wanted. Spray it a bit too much and you will get sick it. I almost threw it away. It was good enough to use all of the product but not to buy again. I wanted citris scent not citris candy. Dissapointed after the first spray...
3,Not the Best Barnard,"One of the pleasures of reading a Robert Barnard mystery is his sly, moderately malicious and very funny social commentary on modern British life. In this book, however, his characterizations of the bad guys are really bitter and vicious, and his hero has no coherent motivation to pursue the course of conduct he does.That said, the depiction of children being evacuated from London to the country without their families is marvelous, and the writing is excellent, as usual. Fans of Barnard will want to read this book, but it is not a good introduction to his work for anyone else."
1,Blackening evidence kept under wraps,"This recording is high BPM electronic club mix. It has almost nothing to do with the music we have come to love from the Stranglers. This recording is not even a good example of the techno/club genre. In the unlikely event that The Stranglers gave their permission for this, I can only hope blackmail was involved. Exceptional talent went into the cover art."
5,Perfect for beginning journalers,"In Journal to the Self, Kay Adams discusses many different ways to write in your journal, including how to get started, and includes examples of each technique. When I teach journaling workshops, I always recommend this book to my students as easy to read, easy to use, and an excellent resource to turn to again and again."
2,Not what I was looking for.,"I prefer prompted journals, and this journal mainly gives ideas for how to make a journal and what to use it for. I'm not a creative enough writer to come up with my own prompts so what I look for in a guided journal is one where the author helps you along a little more and gives you ideas for delving into your past, present and future to help heal you and teach you about yourself. This book would be fine for a more independent writer."
5,Begin. The Rest Is Easy!,"Anyone who has ever kept a journal for more than two days eventually is confronted with this awful question when staring at a blank page: Now what?Kathleen Adams responds to this question like a helpful friend, sharing all kinds of tips and tricks in a non-directive and cheerful tone. She covers everything from ""unsent letters"" to marathon writing sessions, from ""lists of 100"" (her own invention) to character sketches a la Anais Nin.This is a reference that the serious journaler will use again and again to renew their journaling. There aren't many used copies of this book for sale on this site. There's a reason for that."
3,divided,"some great techniques for journaling. I tried most of them and liked them. They did not have some profound impact on my life, but it gave journaling a little more dimension and made it intresting. If you do get this book remmeber that it has ALOT of fluff( useless info); flip through the pages, get the gist of the techniques and go for it. It took me about an hour to read this way. It very boring if u read every page"
5,Great! I use the exercises every day!,"I have read this book several times since meeting Kay through a friend last year. She's warm, thought provoking and very insightful - and the best part is this all comes across in her books. Journal to the Self has helped me in ways I couldn't have imagined - it will help you too!"
1,"Very simple, straightforward - EASY. Not good.","If you're simply interested in learning to write a journal as something to do (and nothing more), this appears to be an exceptionally 'easy read'. The author provides a variety of suggestions - but if you're looking for ""deep"" stuff with insightful thoughts, keep looking! This book is NOT for anyone interested in writing to heal - anyone coping with childhood traumas, health concerns, depression, etc. Examples - one of the last sections is on ""Adult Children"". It is 8 pages long. (Anyone who has gone to an ""Adult Child of Alcoholic/Dysfunctional Families"" 12 step meeting hears more information read during the first 10 minutes of each meeting! ""5 stages of Grief - 9 pages. And remember, the book is a small paperback so 9 pages doesn't cover much. I know that any ""adult child"" or anyone going through grieving will need far FAR more insight that what can be gained in 8 or 9 small pages of print. I would return it if I could."
2,WWE-MAGINATION,"we have 5 of the WWE/WWF albums,but this ties the PAST and PRESENT together.if you are a WWE fan as we are,you NEED thisalbum--just close your eyes and ENVISUALIZE!!!!"
4,Old School Hero Worship,"WWE Anthology 3-disc set is a great addition to any 80s-90s WWF/WWE fan. Great selection of theme songs from Hulk Hogan's unmistakable ""Real American"" theme to Bret Hart's to D-Generation X's ""Break It Down"" ... Unfortunately, they only added original themes written by James A. Johnston so if you're looking for 'Macho Man' Randy Savage's ""Pomp & Circumstance"" or Ric Flair's ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" (sp?) you're out of luck. Also, the New Age Outlaws theme doesn't have their mic hits (i.e. ""Oh you didn't know?!"") Otherwise a very good selection of themes to enjoy and get you amped up with."
5,Best of the WWE,"Basically this 3 CD set covers pretty much the entire history of the WWE. Starting with Hulk Hogan in the Early 80's (I am a Real American) and going through today covering such new hits as Brock LEsnar, Rey Mysterio and Eric Bischoff this set covers most of the memorable stars. From Hogan, to Bret Hart, to Austin to Brock Lesnar this is a must own for Die Hard WWE Fans."
4,Good CD,Firstly let me say that there are people here writing reviews requesting that Booker T and The Hardyz themes be put on etc. Those themes are production and ARE NOT OWNED BY THE WWE. So stop requesting them. Thry can only put Jim Johnston made themes.This is a good CD
5,The Best Songs on the Album,"Here are my top 10 best songs on WWE Anthology.1.) Stephanie McMahon - ""All Grown Up"" - CD 32.) Sunny - ""I Know You Want Me"" - CD 13.) Trish Stratus - ""Time to Rock & Roll"" - CD 34.) Sable - ""Wild Cat"" - CD 15.) Torrie Wilson - ""Need a Little Time"" - CD 36.) Eric Bischoff - ""I'm Back"" - CD 37.) Triple H - ""My Time"" - CD 28.) Mr.McMahon - ""No Chance in Hell"" - CD 29.) Judgment Day Theme - ""The End"" - CD 310) Lita - ""It Just Feels Right"" - CD 2"
4,Wwe,"The best songs on anthology are the following:cd1 2,6,8,18,25,30cd2 2,3,11,17,24,31,34,35cd3 2,5,8,15"
3,WWE Anthology- The Review,"Overall, this CD is great if you're a WWE fan. Otherwise, you might not like it since these are the authenic WWE SuperStars themes. If you're looking for some WWE theme songs with some rock music in it, get WWE Forceable Entry- it's possibly the best CD that WWE/SmackDown Records ever put out."
2,"wwe march,26,2003",these are the 2 best songs from the anthology cd3 undertaker(youre gonna pay) and brock lesnar next big thing
5,Best Wrestling Album EVER,As A Wrestling fan for over 20 years I have enjoyed the music that plays when the wrestlers come to the ring. I am glad that Vince McMahon has decided to put out this CD because some of these theme songs were not available ever. I would highly recommend this great CD for those who are A-1 Wrestling Fans
4,Must Make A Sequal!!!!,"The themes on this CD are fine but could use more.Here is a list of themes I want on the next Anthology Album.1. Macho Man Randy Savage2. Hart Foundation (The Bret Hart theme used from 1988(I am only guessing that year) to 1994)3. British Bulldog4. Undertaker's old themes (especally the 1995-1997 one)5. Dusty Rhodes6. Big Boss Man7. Headbangers8. Hunter Hearst Helmsly (Both 95-96 and 97 versions)9. Texas Tornado10. Owen Hart's Theme from 1994-199711. Legion of Doom12. Rockers13. Tatanka14. Mr. Perfect15. Sid Justice16. Jeff Jarrett's 94-95 theme17. Headbangers18. Rowdy Roddy Piper19. Mountie20. Sgt. Slaughter21. Demolition22. Nasty Boys23. Ric Flair's 91-93 Theme24. Brutus ""The Barber"" Beefcake25. Booker TThose are only 25 things I had in mind. You don't have to agree with me on all of these but whatever YOU want on the next Anthology CD is fine with me too."
2,Dissapointing,"I really thought that this was going to be one of WWE's best CDs but for me it was a let down - As I WWE fan, I collected all the CD's before Anthology so I had half of them already. I really picked up Anthology for the 3rd Album - I was very dissapointed with the songs on it and to see that it didn't have Rob Van Dam or The Hardy'z Entrance Music. Neither did it have Austin's Heavy Metal Entrance - A bad buy... but that's just my opinion!"
3,"Ok, but not Great","The whole thing is, if you are a wrestling fan, you most likely have the cd's the songs originated from, with the exception of the very few previously unreleased tracks.The 1st disc is the gem of the set, showcasing old wrestling tracks from the late 80's all the way through the 90's. The problem is though, that very few songs are from the 80's. Which kind of defeats the purpose of this being a anthology, when 90% of the tracks come from 1996-2002, leaving out mainly anything from the mid 80's to mid 90's.It would have been better to see a better timeline of great themes, as the cd indicates there being a timeline theme going, but they failed, and chose to produce this as cheaply as possibly, by recycling anything from previous albums, and leaving us with unreleased tracks that very well could have remained unreleased."
4,Another well made music compilation by the WWE,"This album contains three generations of WWE music. Like a lot of people, I was a little disappointed that most of the songs on this album have already been released on previous WWE CD's. This album contains some good songs such as: Hulk Hogan's, Jake Roberts', The Ultimate Warrior's, I'll Be Your Hero, one of Edge's old themes, Kurt Angle's, The Rock's, The Dudley's, Jericho's two themes, Christian's, Torrie Wilson's, and Billy & Chuck's. Unfortunately, this album also contains some songs that are so unbelievably pathetic that I can't believe they were put on it. The bad songs include: Brother Love's, Bertha Faye's, William Regal's, Eddie Guerrero's, Mark Henry's, and D-von Dudley's. Other than that, this is a good piece of work by the WWE and it's good to see that the WWE can still please their fans musically."
3,Ok but far from perfect...,"I hadn't owned any of the WWE Cds except Wrestlemania The album before purchasing this one and I was eager to hear all the old tracks from the Federation Years.All in all it's a good idea to bring out an album like this but I give this album only a 3 out of 5 because so many important themes are missing...Where is Ricky Steamboat's theme? Or the following:Rick the Model Martel,Superstar Billy Graham,Demolition,The Undertaker's first(???),The Rockers,Macho Man,Rowdy Piper...I just hope they kept them back and want to release them on a second edition...Otherwise it would be really disappointing.So check the tracklisting first before you buy.Overall it's ok but far from being perfect."
4,Pretty Good Set,"From all the negative feedback it recieved online, I have to say WWE Anthology is very good. Some of the tracks that were on some of the previous Volumes of WWF/WWE The Music series have been altered, which is good giving them a new kind of edge. A nice collection ...I recommmed it."
5,The best cd ever,this cd is great. i love it. it has great songs and shows all the songs from wwf/wwe. buy it. its worth it. the are the best songs ever. Buy IT! Its great to listen too it and when you listen to your favorite wrestlers(s)song it makes you think about the best moments of that wrestler.
3,"Good, but lacking.","Overall this CD set is well put together. However, its lacking many great themes (i.e. Hardy Boys, L.O.D, Maven, Undertaker theme w/ the bells and thunder, The Rocks 1st theme which was the one that was similar to vol. 3 but was never released, HHH's 1st theme when he was Hunter Hearnst Helmsley and his ""My Time"" version w/o the vocals, Stone Cold's alliance theme, nWo, Booker T, The Headbangers, A.P.A, X-Factor, Mark Henry when he was in the Nation, Hollywood Hulk Hogan, Trish's 1st theme, T&A, Jeff Jarret, 3 Minute Warning, and finally Marc Mero. If they added these themes then this CD would without a doubt be the BEST WWF/WWE CD ever."
5,Attention All Hardcore Wrestling Fans!!!,"""WWE Anthology"" is the most comprehensive musical representation of the WWE (or WWF), past and present. Broken down into three discs, each representing a prominent era in WWE history, this compilation of WWE Superstar enterance theme music takes its listener on a journey through the history of the wrestling company's most popular mat stars from the 80s through the present day... Being a rabid wrestling fan since the WWE's (WWF's) first mainstream surge of popularity in the 80s, I truly appreciate the music on this compilation. For any new fans of the WWE, especially those who do not have any of the WWE's other musical compilations, I highly recommend ""Anthology"" because I feel it is an important representation of WWE history."
2,What? No Demolition? No Axe and Smash entrance?,"I can't believe they left off one of the best theme songs of them all! Demolition's entrance music was a great tune with great lyrics written specifically for them. ""This is the Axe! This is the Smasher! They're Demolition. Walking disaster!""What a crying shame."

5,Best Collection Of Wrestling Music Ever!,WWE Anthology is one of the best CD's I have ever heard. This CD has it all. At first when I started watching wrestling in 1995 I watched the WCW. The first things I got into was the theme music. WCW never really put out a good CD. Then in 1998 I started watching the WWF/E. I loved the music there also. The WWE put out a few good CD's but I never heard the early songs. This CD has it all. It is a great CD to bye
1,Horrible,I cant figure out why people are liking this.It doesnt even have The Undertakers classic funeral music with the tolling bells.Its rehashed garbage!
4,Charmingly illustrated celebration of tea parties.,"Charming illustrations, delightful poems with delicious tea tips on every page! My grandaughter only wanted to read two of them at first, and then wouldn't be satisfied until we read the whole thing twice!"
4,Fun-but watch Barbie's hair!,"My daughter is 3 and loves this toy, especially the dolphin, but we had a ""traumatic"" event when Barbie's hair became entangled in the motor blades of the boat. The boat stopped functioning, and Barbie had to have an emergency haircut! We were able to take apart the boat,remove all of the hair and get it functioning again. My daughter is now very cautious never to stick her own hair (or Barbie's) near the propeller when she has the boat in the tub!"
3,Fun for my 4 year old but.....,The jetski runs for a minute or two and then flips over. She has to constantly drain the water out.....very annoying.
1,Barbie needs a rescue at sea,After just one use in the tub the jet ski no longer works. My 7 yr old bought this with her own money & needless to say is extremely disappointed. This is a piece of junk!
3,Carolina oBLIQUE TOE BOOT PURCHASED FROM AMAZON,This boot is heavy and loose in the heel can't seem to get used to it. I had given a better review previously but now having lived with it for a while I'm having second thoughts.
3,OK product,"Doesn't last as long as I thought it would. Could be from some roaming, but I'd buy a normal battery if I could again. It's not worth making the phone larger for the tiny bit of extra life."
3,Pattern of skulls,"Very warm and funky looking design, I did not notice the scary looking skulls printed in the fabric. Daughter does like the dreary idea of menacing skulls on her head gear. She odes wear it but not as often as I had intended when I purchased it."
4,great beach blanket :),"... nice, large beach blanket. it's a little on the light side so i had to weigh the corners down with flip-flops, bags, etc. easy to fold back in to the carrying bag ..."
1,Dangerous,I bought this since my daughter and I go to the parks often. But was very unsatisfied with the product. We use it for a couple of minutes and had to put it away. My daughter is 16months old and every time she tried to stand up she would slip and fall on her bottom! The Fabric kept on moving under her and making it slippery for any one to try and sit down or walk accross it!Would not recommend it to anyone to purchase!
5,Love it!,"This does't say waterPROOF, it says waterRESISTANT. And that it is. I love mine and it is easy to fold and put back in its carrier. I carry a lot of stuff around and this slings right over my shoulder. I use it at the beach and at the park. I keep it in my car. Unfortunately, I paid $49.99 from TUFFO.com and luckily, you can get it here for less! I recommend this. My family and I lead a very active lifestyle and this is always around and being used and washed over and over again and it still holds up. I have had it about a year or more, now. Hope this helps."
1,Cheap fabric and annoying carrying sling,I've bought $20 blankets at Target that kick this one to the curb. The fabric is cheap and it is not very travel friendly (the case is really a sling and cumbersome to carry). Save your cash and buy one of the emergency blankets at Target/ K-Mart that zip up nicely and are water resistant as well.
4,good quality blanket,"Although a little costly, this is a quality blanket suitable for camping or outdoor picnic. I would recommend this product."
4,Great Beach or Picnic Blanket,We used this blanket every day on our beach trip. It worked great and was easy and light to carry. It's also machine washable which is really important to me. I think it's a little pricey but it is a good product. I plan to keep it in my trunk now for picnics with my kids or a place for the baby to nap at outdoor events.
4,Nice blanket,"We use this blanket for sitting in the grass at the free Friday concerts nearby. We haven't yet had to test its water resistance because we are in a drought, so the ground has been pretty crunchy.I do wish that it was a little bit bigger to allow us to spread out more, but doesn't feel cramped. Having a carrying case is one of the best parts of this blanket. It makes transport very easy."
3,Great Size-bad design,"This does NOT come w/or in a bag. The 'Bag' is straps that you have to fold the blanket and fit it into the straps that have a pocket on them. Not a bag, like it states or leads you to believe. The fabric is silky and therfore slides. VERY thin fabric, not at all 'blanket' type, more like sheet type.that said, for under 20$ its a good purchase if you know what you are looking at and the description matches. Saw it for 40$ on here also, and that is a rip off!"
3,Thicker than I thought,"I should have paid more attention to how big it is. I envisioned it being more compact and something I could throw in a bag along with other beach things, but it is thick enough to require it being carried separately.Overall, we enjoyed using this on the beach, but I wish I would have purchased something more compact."
2,So light that flies away!!!,"The blanket is so light-weight that it's impossible to use it when there is even the slightest wind. Even if you try to anchor the corners, it still all gets lift up by the wind. I am not sure I see any use for the blanket unless you know there will be no wind (which is NEVER.) A total waste of money!"
1,"NOT ""100% comfy cotton on the top"" as claimed","Label on attached to blanket says top is 20% cotton, 80% polyester. Filling and back lining are 100% polyester. The blanket feels thin and cheap. Sending it back."
5,High quality and good looking!,"This was exactly what it promised to be. The carrying case is useful (once you learn to fold it so it fits, it's even better) and it's a quality product. Good to keep in the car. Great for picnics, or just sitting in grass. Plenty of room for 2 to stretch out or four to sit."
1,NOT worth the Price!,"Poor quality blanket. Cheap fabric, not worth the price tag. I should've read the reviews before ordering, because Babyride's poor return policy makes it cost 50% of the cost to return. DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT unless the price drops to $20."
1,Tuffo Water Resistant Blanket,This blanket drives me crazy. The nylon bottom makes it slippery and it constantly bunches up. My toddler gets tripped up in it and falls. I put it in the garage and use it to cover the BBQ in the winter b/c it is useless as a blanket. I would give it 0 stars except the blue floral fabric is quite pretty - just don't sit on it!
1,too slippery,"too slippery -- due to the plastic (nylon) water resistant bottom, it slips on grass and on wood (our deck) -- thus we used it just once or twice and now do not use it anymore"
2,disappointed,"i was disappointed with the size and the thickness, especially considering the price. the size is rectangle shaped so it doesn't fit well under the playyard and it is too thin so you can feel every little pebble or twig underneath it."
5,Awsome for damp grass playing or picnics,"We just LOVE this Tuffo Blanket for sitting on the damp lawn outside to keep our bums dry, or for picnics to put on the icky table to keep germs away from hands & food. It's easy to bring along anywhere with it's carrying pack & keeps us dry & clean. Speaking of clean, it washes GREAT, too. HIGHLY recommended!!!"
5,not just for picnics,"i purchased this blanket to protect new furniture from my two dogs, who are allowed on furniture, but one likes to nibble, and the other drools and licks obsessively. they are also old, and occasionally incontinent on furniture.... this blanket has saved my furniture day after day, and holds up great in the countless trips through the washer and dryer. i'm so pleased with the product that i'm purchasing a second. i typically don't like to spend lots of money, but this item is worth every penny!"
5,Excellent for picnics,"I use this for picnics at the playground. This is great. Large enough, portable and washable. Would totally recommend ."
1,it sucks,i bought this coffemaker after about the 5th use it started leaking out the bottom the next one as another reviewer noted just stopped working the magic carafe still spills if u dont place it in perfectly overall this is overpriced junk thats broke2 times i bought a cheapo 15dollar coffemaker at target and its worked about 50 times so far so dont waste your money on this crap u wanna buya real nice coffe maker get a braun because black and decker suk now
3,The caraff is the only redeeming feature,"This could have been an EXCELLENT coffee maker, but it was poorly engineered. If you don't put in the caraff in JUST RIGHT, it leaks. That's how the first one was damaged by my mother-in-law. Took it back for a replacement. Now I'm replacing it a second time because it's leaking internally when it sucks up the water from the resevoir to be brewed. Yes, I agree -- the beep is too freaking loud. Wakes up the neighbors. It should have been designed with a volume or AT LEAST a feature to turn it off as a menu item. But the caraff is excellent. It DOES NOT drip. Quite amazing. B&D need to redesign this whole coffee maker, but keep the caraff."
1,"""Save Your Money""","I bought this same Black and Decker coffee maker at a department store. It worked fine for a few months. I broke the carafe and when I discovered the carafe cost as much as a new maker, I decided to just buy a new coffee maker.The new one worked for 3 & 1/2 weeks.I took the old coffee maker and new carafe and set the new one aside.Today the old one would not heat or perk.I can not return it because I no longer have the box. ( my fault.)I certainly shouldn't have to pay postage on a new product less than a month old.Nevermore, nevermore.Save your money, this has been no bargain."
3,Lasted one year.,"Our Smart Brew died yesterday. It won't heat up any longer. We bought it almost a year ago. It was an okay machine -- nothing great, but we've had worse."
2,Really Really Bad,"This 3rd volume in the Mission Earth series is really, really bad. It should be subtitled 'Soltan in New York'. Every other chapter ends with the phrase 'Heller is ruined now!'. It's like a 3-Stooges book. Soltan schemes, Heller escapes, Soltan growls and takes it out on subordinates. Characters are beyond belief, even for so-called satire."
1,Mission Earth volume 3,"This is only the third volume out of ten and this series is already starting to get tiring. The plot meanders aimlessly at a snail's pace and the so-called satire falls flat almost every time (one genuinely funny moment was when Soltan Gris tries to call Delbert John Rockecenter). So much time is spent on the pointless subplot about Soltan's dancing girl Utanc. The real story doesn't really get going until the last 100 pages and then the book ends with a cliffhanger. I wouldn't keep reading this series if I hadn't already bought all ten volumes, and I don't recommend it."
5,Earth is in the path of conquest...,"The story continues in Mission Earth Volume 3. It's another fun and fancy twist and turn to the story this time. Jettero Heller, the Voltarian Fleet Officer on assignment to save Earth from pollution winds up living in the posh Gracious Palms whorehouse across the street from the United Nations! He also links up with a mafia family who take him in as their own son, and things get really wild! The story is continued to be narrated by Soltan Gris, a killer sent to sabotage Heller's mission. This book 3 of the story really starts to include some bizarre characters and incidents that will make you want to flee this part of the galaxy! You will enjoy how the story develops further in this book, and the plots and schemes get broader and more exciting. I loved reading this whole series."
3,an acceptable suppliment,"an acceptable strategy guide if you don't want to spend unnecessary hours finding hard-hidden items and hard-hidden keys to locked doorswhile the book provides you with sufficient info. to get through each world, it does not hold your hand too much- it allows you some self-discovery while covering the essentialsthe major drawback is that the book gives false information on how to access the necromondia cave level. apparently the guide was written using an earlier 'draft' of the game.considering this is the longest, most difficult level in the game, and considering no one at prima temp would help me with this problem when i called...i knocked two stars off this review"
3,some drawbacks,"Good things about this vacuum:it has a very long cordit is quite powerfulit is not hard to empty and does not require bagsBad things:It is quite heavythe exhaust, as other reviewers have commented, tends to blow the dirt around the back of the appliance"
2,short vac,This vac has good suction but the wand is very short. It is difficult to vacinside of car without having to hold the unit in one hand & vac with other.It won't sit on seat & have wand long enough to vac.
4,Great for stairs,"Exactly what I needed for the stairs in our home. The attached hose is really helpful in getting into the edges. Only drawback might be that someone with a bad back will find this awkward. You do have to get up close and personal with the area you are vacuuming. Other wise, great little vacuum, easy to clean the filter and it works on upholstery as well."
2,Not what I expected,Wanted a hand held vacuum with a brush to use on furniture. This vacuum is very awkward and very hard to handle. It is also heavy - should have looked into buying in a store instead of online. Very sluggish on furniture seems to lag in power. Look before you buy.
1,Worst Item I've Ever Purchased!,"This item is very poorly designed! After vacuuming a single flight of stairs, the entire area at the foot of stairs was covered with dust, I was sneezing, and the unit was covered with dust! It should be mentioned that I'd cleaned the steps only 2wks prior, so it's not like they contained a year's worth of dust. I've used bagless vacuums before, and they've never performed this poorly. Eureka certainly has tarnished their reputation by having their name on this device. It's absolutely TERRIBLE"
1,Worthless,"This vacuum was worthless after two months of use. It still turns on and provides a small amount of suction, but not enough to accomplish anything. It overheats and turns off after about 5 minutes. Of course, it lasted just long enough that we couldn't return it to Amazon. Very disappointing."
5,worth every penny,"It is very good, a bit heavy when the 20ft cable is wrapped around it. I Highly recommand it"
2,Bewildered by all the great reviews...,"I'm a little bewildered by all the good reviews for this vacuum - maybe I just got a dud. It worked great the first few times I used it, but now that I've had it for a few months, it has pretty much stopped working altogether. The last time I used it, I noticed that nothing I sucked up seemed to be going into the dust bin. When I turned it off and picked it up... everything I had sucked up fell out onto the rug. I'm really disappointed in this product."
2,Hair clogs in roller and it died after a year,"At first I was so excited that the vacuum cleaner picked up all the cat hair! It's true, it was very strong and worked well. But the cat hair would clog in the roller and it was time-consuming and hard to pull it out. Also the filter is hard to clean and would take days to dry. Then after a year (almost 2 weeks after the warranty expired) it stopped sucking. So now it's just sitting in my closet, useless, until I have time to go have it fixed."
5,Small but very strong suction,This item cleaned my steps so well. It didn't lose suction or power it was great. I told all of my friends about it.
3,"Great suction, good value, room for improvement.","Pros:Inexpensive, good valuePowerful suctionExtra long power cordDoes what a vacuum is supposed to do.Cons:Vent is positioned downward, so dust and pet hair blows everywhere, even when you're being careful.Vents powerfully and generates a lot of heat, much like the average hand-held blow dryer.Hose is short, so not very helpful.Best for flat surfaces, won't reach nooks and crevices in car.Very bulky (definitely not a Dust Buster) and a bit heavier than I was expecting.I anticipate having to replace the filter often.Good quality at this price. Just don't set your expectations too high."
4,Really sucks!,"This little vacuum is great for my dorm room. I was getting exasperated having to haul out the huge dorm vacuum for my little space and this vacuum solved my problem. It is small enough to comfortably keep in my room, is attractive, and get most of the dirt up in a timely way. We'll see how it stands up to the test of time for durability, but I'm happy so far."
1,Motor died abruptly after 8 months of infrequent use.,"This was a decent enough vacuum for the time that it worked. The cord was nice and long, the suction was sufficient, the dustbin was easy to empty. I did notice that dust seemed to hover at the top near the filter, but I cleaned the filter regularly so it wasn't really a problem.After eight months of infrequent use (probably once a month) there were red flashes inside and the motor made a few unhappy noises and abruptly cut off.Despite its adequate performance, I have to give it one star because eight to ten uses does not a good appliance make."
5,Did I really just say I love my vacuum?,"Yes. And I really do.After going through several really cheap vacuums, this one is a life-saver. I wish I had it in college. It's really powerful and the cord is long enough to stretch across my entire living room. It's a bit heavier than I would like (maybe I just need to work out more), but I haven't had any problems since I don't use if for extended periods of time."
3,Handle is too uncomfortable,"I looked and researched a long time for a hand held vacuum to clean my carpeted stairs. This sounded perfect and was the right price. But, unfortunately, it was heavy and cumbersome for me to use. I had difficulty holding onto it and directing it with one hand (the grip is wide, my hands are small, and I didn't have enough hand strength). I ended up giving it away. I am back using my canister vacuum and still looking for a substitute."
4,Great for removing pet hair!,"After having this vacuum for a couple of months, I'm happy with its performance. It works quite well for getting dog hair off of furniture, and the riser visor feature is great for cleaning the stairs. I find that the design makes it a bit awkward to handle, but worth the trouble given how well it sucks up the dog hair. As another reviewer noted, the dust cup fills up quickly."
4,Like a dream,"This thing is great! I had back surgery a couple months ago so I can't lift the old vacuum like I used to. We have a cat and a very furry dog so pet hair is a constant problem. We can do the furniture with ease and the stairs get more attention now too. The way the front guard flips up makes it alot easier to do vertical surfaces. It sure beats holding a full size vacuum sideways! My 9 year old is even capable of using it. Yeah, more chores!! The only downfall I've found is that the pet hair and dander block the filter very quickly. You have to empty it often which can be annoying, but lets face it, you're probably not going to vacuum your whole house with it. I'd buy it again in a heart beat."
4,"Eureka Hand-held Vacuum, 71B","We have found this to be a good vacuum with very good suction. It cleans up well after the dog off blankets, floors, etc. The only problem I have found is that the plug prongs are not separated wide enough so it is loose in the receptable. I keep having to separate the prongs every time I use it. The vacuum is heavy but doable. The vacuum is also loud, but that is expected from a vacuum as far as I am concerned."
4,works well,"I am impressed with the suction power of this little vacuum--it picks up mostly everything on the first pass. I use it on carpeted stairs and in the car, and so far, I have been pleased with its ability to do those jobs. I think the cord is a convenient length (I have never run out of cord), though the vacuum itself is fairly heavy for its size. I had hoped that our kids could use it to help around the house, but I'm not sure they'll be able to comfortably use it because of its weight (it gets a little heavy, even for me)."
5,Awesome Vacuum!,"I bought this vacuum to use on the stair case. It got good suction and pick up a lot of dust and dirt. The cons are that it is super loud, heat up fast, heavy and the handle is not ergonomic. It is quite heavy to lift the vac and it would be nice if there are two little wheels on the back so it is easier to glide on carpet. Overall, it is still a good vac, tested on my stair case and it works like a dream."
5,Terrific Vacuum!,"I love this vacuum! It's perfect for cleaning the stairs because it's so much easier to handle than the full size machine. It's also ideal for cleaning dog hair off of our white sofa. Bad doggie! I also like the detachable hose and attachment, which make small clean up and getting dirt out of crevices so easy. I definitely recommend this Eureka."
5,I LOVE IT!!,"Great product! Vacuums up the cat hair off the furniture, and everything else. Quick, and easy! I just love it!"
2,Not that efficient,"Not that efficient Bot this unit from Amazon over a year ago based on reviews. I am mostly disappointed in the cleaning performance and ease of use. This vac is heavy, noisy, hard to push around. The dust filters clog with dirt when washed which reduces air flow the next time you use it. Filters run about $7.50 ea and with their limited capacity and ability to be reused could become a fair expense over time. I would not recommend this vacuum to a friend."
1,"Hasn't even been a year, no longer vacuums","This vacuum was great for the first few months,Then it gradually began to fail at sucking up particles.Now it makes my floor dirtier by use, even though I've cleaned it with nearly every use.It refuses to pick up a few measly cornflake crumbs, and much else.Instead it decides to just push them around...It pretty much just gets clogged by dust very easily...my room is dusty.Not worth the money if you don't plan on buying another within the next year."
5,A real champ,"This little vac is powerful and will not disappoint in that regard. It's build quality is good as is its fit and finish. You will read that some say it's a bit heavy, and that of course is relative, but I agree it's got some weight to it. It's a trade-off: the lighter hand vacs I have could not do near what this Eureka does daily. A wall mount would be a great accessory for this but alas, no sign of one."
4,Great for stairs!,"I was looking for a vacuum do to the carpeted stairs. The Eureka is perfect for that! I have 2 cats, and it gets all the pet hair out easily. It's light, with a long cord (stretches down a whole flight). The handle is not padded at all, so my hand is a little sore after 30 min of vacuuming. But other than that, the vacuum is great."
4,Little yellow different.,Arrived in timely fashion and good condition. I'm glad it has a cord so it has consistent power source. Works great on stairs and on Feline Pine Cat litter.
5,Very Strong Hand-Held Vacuum Cleaner,I purchased this item mainly to clean up after my small birds (scattered seeds and feathers) and it does a very good job. I am impressed with how well it is built and the strong suction it has. The vacuum cleaner is a bit heavy for me so I must support its weight while I vacuum the bird cages but I like the way it cleans. I also like the way I can dump out the contents of the little plastic cup afterwards. It is easy to operate. I really like the look and feel of this vacuum cleaner.
4,"Deb-Aurora, IL","I've been looking for a light weight hand-held vacuum for a while. My fibromyalgia stops me from lifting weight over 8 lbs. most days. I would give the Eureka 71 A Hand-Held a four-star rating. It's light, easily vacuums the hard to reach riser on the stairs. We have 14 stairs. I'm well aware of how tiring vacuuming came become. This little vacuum even picks up my Maine Coon's angora-like cat hair. The weight of this vacuum is perfect for small jobs, confined and small space areas to clean. The main disadvantage is the vacuum's very small filter. I need to change the filter after every vacuum but I put this vacuum through the paces. I'd highly recommend this vacuum for small apartments, condos, cars, etc. It is easy to handle and its light weight of 5 lbs. makes it possible for almost anyone to use. Very delighted with this hand-held and happily recommend this item to others."
4,great for stairs,We bought this product to vacumn carpeted stairs. It is a little heavy but does a wonderful job picking up cat hair.
4,Amazing!,"I'm so happy with this purchase. I just received it today and immediately took it out to try. It sucked up all the cat hair that's been clinging for dear life to my couch that I've been fighting with lint rollers for months. I'm so pleased and relived. FINALLY! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5, is because the air that comes out the back of it has potential of blowing whatever it is you're trying to suck up away. It happened when I was trying to clean up some cat litter, but with careful movements you can avoid it somewhat."
5,"Small, Powerful","I wasn't sure that I believed all of the other reviews, but as it turns out, this is a really small, powerful machine. I've used it to clean my area rug, and also to clean up the needles from my dead christmas tree, and it has provided a lot of power and no problems.I've suggested that many of my family go out and purchase this instead of a Dyson handheld; I'm really glad that I looked around. It is a small enough vacuum that I can hide it, I don't have to make sure to charge it, and it is powerful enough to actually clean up the area I want it to clean."
3,okay for the price,"i've got this because of high rating, but it didn't meet my expectation. The suction is good and the collected dusts can be easily removed, but it's got weak edge and it can not do what cordless smaller area hand held vacuum cleaners can do. I did not get the cordless because the cordless is too weak or expensive or the batteries die too short. it's heavier than other hand held and cord really is on the way to use in your car..."
4,Go vac for stairs,Needed a vac to do stairs this hit the spot. Also used to clean my computer. Did a great job.
4,Works Awesome!,"I purchased this product because my old one that i had for 20 years broke recently, and i couldnt be happier with this vacumn! It works perfect for the steps and gets up a ton of pet hair! I recommend highly!"
4,Sweet vacuum,"This thing is petty sweet. I would def recommend it to a friend. It has only 2 flaws in my opinion. The first major issue is that despite the great utility of this thing, it has a cord. Boo. Second minor issue is the air exhaust on he vac can sometimes blow stuff away when it bounces the air off of other surfaces like surrounding walls or cabinets. So for those reasons I dock a star. Other than that I'm happy with the performance so far."
4,Great Portable Vacuum,"We got this for our small apartment that has a few carpets. Worked great and picked up a lot of dirt. This is NOT heavy at all. I felt the cord was heavier. They do give you a long cord. Overall, very nice and works great."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I just don't get it. I was satisfied at first. Yes, it is very loud but that didn't matter to me as the suction was good. HOWEVER, for some reason the hose suction is nil. I have to pick up what I am going for and put it inside the hose. This makes is somewhat worthless to me. I have had it for a couple of years but hardly used it."
3,works great but....,"I love the power behind this little machine, but I am frustrated both by the weight (it's supposed to have alleviated the stress of lugging my full sized vacume up the stairs) and also by the small filter that gets plugged up immediately. My hope is that these bagless vacumes are going to be redesigned in the near future to allow for more extended use before filters have to be taken out, cleaned, replaced etc. Id give this vacume a 5 star rating for the power and suction, if it wasnt for the inconvenience of cleaning the filter so frequently and its heavy weight."
4,Great!,"It has a great sucking power... it is easy to manuver, not too heavy. It is perfect for small spaces... It comes with an extra piece that helps grab dirt in small areas... The only downfall is the fact that it is a plug in and not cordless... but that is also another reason why we got it... so that it would have the intense sucking power that a vacuum should have. Definitely recommend!"
5,Daughter in Law Loves This,"Given to our DIL as part of her Christmas gifts, as she had always borrowed my old step vacuum. We both liked it so much that I will purchase one for myself to replace my old one.l"
5,Excellent tool!,I was impressed with the other reviews. Decided to try myself and I'm glad that I did that. About the delivery... I thought about paying for the delivery because it looked much faster than a usual free one. Finally decided to skip that and glad that I did. The vacuum was delivered on the next day for free since we got an Amazon store here in Phoenix. So 38.54 is a very good out-of-pocket price for this tool. The vacuum is really powerful. I was looking for something like that and I'm not disappointed. I have already recommended this vacuum to several friends.
4,hand held vac,"Nice product features, works well especially on and under furniture, in window casings ,at the bottom of sliding doors. It is easy to empty but a bit messy. It is a little heavier than I imagined."
5,THIS IS THE BEST THING SINCE SLICED BREAD!!!!,"Don't be put off by the low price of this vacuum. I couldn't believe how GREAT this thing works. If you have kids, pets, vehicles, or just simply live a normal life . . . you gotta get this vacuum. I don't know what I did before it arrived!!! YOU WON'T BE SORRY & I NEVER WRITE REVIEWS!!!!"
5,Best stair vacuum!,"I have had this vacuum for almost a year now and I'm still as satisfied today as I was the day I received it. It works GREAT at picking up dog and cat hair from stairs and furniture. I also have a Dyson animal AND a Kirby and this little, inexpensive vacuum works better than either one of them! I highly recommend this vacuum to anyone with stairs or an animal that hangs out on the furniture. You wont be disappointed!"
1,not as good as it's said,"I found it's still not light enough, not that handy as I expected.I only used it once after I bought it."
1,Don't waste your money,"We bought this vacuum to clean our 3 area rugs in our house that is completely hardwood. At first it worked great, but after two months we are having major trouble. I bought 2 extra filters and have changed them out as needed. Right now we can't get the switch to go on and off. It is so stuck that I can barely get it to move. And since we can't get the switch to go on and off the roller doesn't work anymore either. I am very disappointed with this product. I am actually researching a better vacuum to buy to replace this one."
1,Sorry Vacuum,"This vaccum requires a screwdriver to turn it on you have to use the screwdriver to push the button as far forward as possable to turn the beater brushes on and sometimes they still don't come on,and you need a screwdriver to take the cover off, it won't even be noticibley full and you can feel the power go out of it and you have to empty it and start over. Would NEVER recommend and it I hadn't have put it in the garage and forgot about for so long would have returned it. I would tell anyone don't buy this it is a sorry piece of equipment"
1,"great, until it caught on FIRE","Everyone raved about this little guy so I bought one. It was great until about two months in. First, the roller stopped rolling. Then a few days later while I was vaccuming my area rug (this and my couch were the only things I vacuumed with this to combat cat hair) the vacuum got extremely hot. The air coming out of the exhaust hole in the back was a smokey for a second, then the vacuumed died completely. I own an extremely fat and hairy cat. I guess his unruly mane was no match for this handheld? Or it's just a piece of crap. Kind of a shame, it worked nicely until it almost burnt down my apartment building."
1,Does this thing even work for Asia? Or did I receive a faulty set?,"Received the set I ordered after courier sent it to me. When plugged in, this thing could not even start after I switched it on. Very disappointing."
4,Nice little hand vac,"This vac has really good suction. It works well on furniture and hard wood. It picked up the cat hair off of the furniture. The only thing I don't like is hard difficult I found cleaning the filter to be. It gets dirty really easy and the dirt is difficult to clean off.but overall, I love this vacuum. It's made cleaning the stairs a life saver!"
4,Good vacuum for small apartment,"This is a good, sturdy little vacuum, which serves me well in my little one bedroom apartment. I got this mostly to help me quickly clean up pet hair and liter mess from my cats without having to dig my big hoover from the pantry closet. I actually use it for all my vacuuming now. My favorite feature is the reusable, washable filter. No more scouring the internet for vacuum filters that have been discontinued for a year old product. Not to mention the money savings from not having to purchase new filters."
5,Nice vacuum,This is a great vacuum. Strong suction and very portable. I use it mostly to vacuum my car but as someone else stated it would be great to clean your staircase as well. The only thing I did not like was the crevice attachment was a little too short. Someone mentioned that it is very loud. It is as loud as any other vacuum. Actually I think my shop vac is louder.
4,Great Little Vac!,This vac does a great job.! The only reason it is not five stars is because the extension hose could be longer.
3,"Okay, but not great","I've had this little hand vac for a few months now. I've been using it regularly in an RV and I can honestly say, it's just okay. I'm in the market for a replacement. Why? Hair does not make it to the dirt cup, but rather gets wrapped around the brush and stays there until you cut it out. The dirt cup fills very quickly so even in my small space (maybe 100sqft of carpet), I have to dump the cup twice each time I vacuum. The filter gets nasty quickly too so it really needs to be washed at least every couple of uses. The filter that comes with the vacuum is washable, but having two (one to use while the other dries) would be helpful. Unlike some others, I haven't had an issue with the vac overheating, however, my space is very small so I'm not using the vac for any extended period of time. My advice? If you're looking for something better than a dust buster and plan to use it more than just an occasional clean-up in the car, spend a little more and get a better vac."
4,Works perfect,"I purchased this Hand held product specifically to vacuum staircases. Since purchase, I tried twice until now. Works perfect. No complaints. Sometimes hot air blows out on you. It's just design, but not an issue. I wish Eureka could have used better power cord to handle twists."
5,They Should Sell This at Pet Stores,"I am going to echo most of the other reviews here, but regardless- WOW.If you have pets, you need to get this vacuum. I'm sure that other people could find use for it too, but it is absolutely unmatched in getting pet hair off of carpets and upholstery.It changed the colors of my carpets entirely. I thought one of the area rugs was faded.... noooooooo, it was just covered with 3 dark cats worth of hair. Who knew?I'm sure that you could find minor faults with it, but overall, if the cat or dog hair floating around your life is driving you crazy, BUY THIS NOW."
4,Do not take this little Vacuum lightly,"Don't take this Vacuum lightly, this vacuum has great power. I've been using this vacuum in a lot of places and it hasn't failed to impress. It has a long power cord that can take you to a lot of places. If it has a negative it's the filter cup, which makes it look kind of gross after a while. But there are replacement cups you can buy. The hose on the side does come off and has a tip extension tool to get into those tight spots. Well built, feels solid."
2,I don't get all the rave reviews.,"I don't get all the rave reviews. This is the first hand-held vacuum cleaner I've ever owned and if this is the best the vacuum industry can come up with for this price...there is something wrong. It is powerful, I guess...but, I have a dog (a pug = short, course hair) and it didn't pick up all the hair on the couch - which was one of the reasons I bought it - and, there wasn't even that much to pick up. The worst thing about it - besides having a cord that isn't that long - is it is VERY heavy...and I'm a strong person. I have only the slightest arthritis, and this hurt my hand after vacuuming just a couple of stairs. Maybe it's me but, I just don't feel the love."
2,Great vacuum for 1 year,"This vacuum worked great for getting the dog and cat hair off the stairs in my house. It has plenty of suction power, and the ""Riser Visor"" is a great feature. Unfortunately, after 1 year, the brush stopped operating when in contact with the carpet. Without the rotating brush operating, the pet hair can't be picked up, leaving the the vacuum useless for me."
2,Belt motor burned out after a couple years,We bought this from Amazon a couple of years ago. It was used very infrequently...probably once a month for 3 years. It did a great job when we used it. It was a bit heavy for my 5 year old to use effectively but it was doable. I was extremely disappointed recently to find that the motor for the belt at the front burned out. I can't find any replacement motor online and the way it's wired looks like it would be near impossible to replace anyway. I think that a vacuum like this should last longer than 30-40 uses.
4,Powerful for a hand-held,"I've only had this for a couple of weeks, but I love it! I bought it to use on our carpeted stairs and upholstered furniture for pet hair, and it is perfect for exactly that. It's incredible the amount of hair that it pulls out of the sofa fabric. The cord is nice and long, haven't had to unplug to switch to a closer outlet as I move around a room with it. I use the changeable brush position more than I thought I would, actually pretty handy. 2 minor complaints: weight and fiter design. I have joint problems, and it is on the heavy side for one-handed use. The filter works great, but I think it will need replacing sooner than I would like. I would prefer a filter that can be rinsed off, but this one is a paper-type one. All in all, I would buy it again and I am happy with this vacuum."
4,Great for the price,"This is a great little vacuum! It picked up things on my stairs I didn't even realize were there. The amount of dog hair in the cannister was embarassing - and I clean my stairs at least once a week. The only complaint would be the hose which doesn't have as great of suction when you pull it out to use it for edges, etc. The cord is very long which is extremely helpful also. Great product for the price!"
5,Powerful suction,"I will never buy a Dirt Devil again! This little handheld has incredible suction. I'm very pleased. I hope that it lasts! My only complaint with the vacuum is that the hose is very short and barely stretches at all. The upside to a short hose, though, is that it keeps the unit compact with less unruly bulk to have to put away in your closet."
1,"Please, do not buy this!!!!!","this thing is defective, no doubt in my mind. The blower stopped working shortly before the motor itself died. Within THREE USES, Very powerful at first than it just start becoming useless within a month. It just looks pretty, that is it, dont buy this spend more money get a quality vacuum."
3,Not Terribly User-Friendly,"I actually returned this vacuum. The good: it did have good suction and seemed to pick up very well. Power was not a problem. The cord was plenty long so there was no need to keep unplugging and re-plugging back in.However, the bad... the hose is way too short, and I found that I had to get in a very uncomfortable crouch position to use the vacuum. All in all - it wasn't what I was looking for.Good quality, though!"
5,"it really sucks, in a GOOD way!","I really researched before picking out a handheld vac. I've been dissapointed in the past with others. This one is everything people say, works to perfection!"
5,I would give it 6 starts if I could,"Without a doubt, one of the best things I have ever purchased for around the house. This little unit, really has great suction power. The removable hose and attachment work great. The balance of the unit reduces fatigue. The unit is easy to empty. It would be nice if the cord wound into the unit and if it had a hanger to hang on the wall. But, really who cares when it performs like this?I have a dog that is in a constant stage of shedding. This vac sucks up the hair as good as, if not better than, the $500 upright vac I use to do the open floor space. There is no more moving furniture or not getting into those tight areas.I have a friend that has a Dyson hand held which he spent many times the cost of this little gem. He said, he is going to get one of these. Now, that is a convert!"
4,powerful!!,this is very powerful for a hand held vac. it picks up everything. the drawbacks are it doesnt charge for use in the car and it is noticeable larger than most hand held vacs.
3,Not good for stairs,"I bought it to vacuum stairs. Suction power is good. But since it doesn't have any wheels at bottom, while workingit's hard to move this and feeling hands are pain."
5,Good buy,"We already have two stand-up vacuums in the house: one upstairs and the other one downstairs. Even though one of the vacuum has separable parts we can carry up the stairs to vacuum the stairs, it is a hassle to lug that big thing. So, we needed something small to vacuum the stairs. I did good amount of research before buying this product. It looked like the battery-powered vacuums lack good suction despite their obvious portability advantage. So, we settled for this one and I'm glad we did. The stairs (carpet-covered) look really nice after vacuuming with this. No, it is not too heavy; it is designed to be carried around. The cord does not bother you as much as you might expect; especially when compared to lugging a bug vacuum around.And, well, the price is right, too!"
5,Best Little vac for car and home,"This little vac is easy to carry and will pick up just about anything! been using it lately to suck up fruit fly's that are covering our house, its because we juice and the fruit flys come out of no where, even when its 10 Degrees F outside. works great on cat litter too :)"
4,great for stairs,I really like how easy this vacuum is to handle. It works great for cleaning stairs. It's also an easy grab for those spills that need a quick pick up. I wish it was a little lighter in weight. Otherwise I am glad I puchased it.
4,Powerful vacuum - sometimes gets clogged.,"I didn't use it that much, but it came in handy when I did. I was kind of heavy, but it didn't bother me. I'm just bummed that it stopped working. The motor works, but it's not sucking anymore. There's no belt to replace, so I'm not sure what to do other than complain to Eureka. It's past the 1 year warranty, but as infrequently as I used it, it should've lasted longer.** Edit ** Thanks to another review, I discovered that the hose was just clogged with debris, and a lot of it! Once I cleared it out, it was business as usual. I'm a happy camper."
4,Eureka hand-held vacuum,"[[ASIN:B002XK5V8Q Eureka 71B Hand-Held Vacuum]This little vacuum is light weight, very easy to use and powerful. The only complaint that we have is that the crevice tool falls out when you pick up the vacuum. The little clips inside evidently are not strong enough to hold it in. So far it is working great for picking up fruit loops and goldfish from in and around car seats!"
3,"Works fine, hassle to clean","It works nicely, but it is a real pain to clean. I almost never use it now cause it's a pain to clean. Who wants to touch and breathe in all this dirt and dust."
5,Everything the Reviews Promised,"I bought the Eureka based on the reviewes I read. All seem to be true. It has great suction power and picks everything up (so be careful!). Great for steps and furniture. The hose works well, but as others said, it is short, however the self storage is very nice. When I pull the vacuum out of the closet I have everything. First handheld I have had that is this good. Didn't think there would be a real need for the flip cover on brush but I use it all the time."
3,not as awesome as I had hoped,"Bought this ""hand held"" to vacuum stairs and dog/cat hair from the sofa and bed. Only gets about 90% of the hair and that's with going back and forth several times--then it gets so heavy your arm gets tired. It's certainly too heavy for a staircase. I HATE the filter and dirt cup--you have to pull the hair off of the filter and then I use a soft tooth brush to brush the dirt off of the filter. I used it to vacuum mattresses and furniture--has great suction. On board tool is ok, but doesn't reach far. It's nice that the cord is long and stores wrapped around the unit, but that's also what makes it somewhat cumbersome to use. Don't use it as much as I thought because it's heavy and I just don't like unwrapping and wrapping the cord."
5,Awsome little vac!,"I got this vac to keep up with the mess around my wood stove and I gotta say I'm glad I did. I really like that the brush turns on or off and the hose with a crevice tool,along with it being very lightweight make this vac versatile and very handy. The suction is excellent and the filter easy to remove and wash. I've even used it to clean my car,as the portability makes it easy to use for that as well. I highly recommend this vac!"
5,GREAT!!!,Great little machine for the stairs and small jobs that I do not want to lug out the big Kirby!!
2,Eureka Crappy Clean! Another Chinese Product :(,"I had this vacuum for about a year now and it is not a good vacuum. The vacuum is powerful but it blows dirt out every seem on the vacuum, even after the filter has been cleaned. I'm not sure if I'm cleaning my house or making it more dirty. I'm finally starting to learn...STAY AWAY FROM CHINESE PRODUCTS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN! They are cheap in quality and price!"
4,Great little vacuum,"I have owned several vacuums of all types over the years, but have been the most satisfied with the Eureka brand. We got this one primarily for cleaning carpeted stairs and it does a very good job. It is lightweight, powerful, easy to clean, and offered at a great price. A special feature is the head which swivels to vacuum the risers on stairs. The only ""con"" I can think of might be cord storage, which isn't a problem for me. We haven't had it very long, but based on past experience with the brand and what we've seen so far, I would recommend it to anyone needing a good hand-held vacuum at a good price."
3,Heavy,The vacuum seems to do an okay job on stairs but it's quite heavy and not particularly handy. The rotating brush makes it difficult to push so I probably won't use the brush. I brought it for stairs but it's not much handier than my regular built in vacuum.
2,just a little heavy/ and it broke,the product is a good little vaccum for pet hair removal...the only complaint is that its just a little heavy but the performance more than makes up for that.ok i am now editing my review after having it for 6 months. it just quit working. no explanation ...just quit and now i have to buy a new one.
3,Eureka hand held vacuum,"Received item promptly. For the most it is as advertised - powerful, not too noisy, and does a good job for the size. I was hoping it would do a better job on cat hair - it does a fair job. Otherwise very satisfactory."
4,Yeah....love it,"This is the perfect hand held vacuum for doing your stairway, cloth furniture, vehicles. It has great suction with a rotating brush. Plus, quite long cord."
4,Little Dynamo,This little monster has plenty of power.I mainly use it to clean my car and vacuum my steps. The beater brush gets down deep into the carpet and the powerful suction pulls the dirt away. This is the best hand held vacuum I've used.
4,Works great. Wish hose was a little longer,Vacuums stairs and such great. Wish the hose was a little longer to reach behind washer and dryer to clean lint.
3,"Pretty good suction, but too big","I purchased this to vacuum out our vehicles. As such, it lives in the garage and I've never used it in the house.Pros:It has pretty good suction.The crevice tool is easy to get to and use.Cons:It is too big to completely clean the foot wells in our compact SUV so I end up using the crevice tool more often than I expected. In this respect, It does a better job in our sedan.Even with the SUV or sedan in the garage and the vac plugged into the outlet in the garage, the cord is too short to do the entire vehicle without digging out the extension cord.All in all, it beats driving to the car wash to use their vacuums."
2,"GREAT at the Beginning, NO suction after 4 months","It works great when I first got it. Completely loss its suction after 4 months.I do not use it every day, at most once a week for the stairs.Not a good quality product"
4,Surprise functionality,"We actually wanted a cordless and incorrectly order this cord type vacuum. Thought about it and thought about the amount of dog hair in our house and car and decided to try it out.Glad we did. Perfect machine for getting car carpets and seats clean of dog hair. This is a powerful vacuum coupled with a hoover type belt driven brush. It works.One note, as mentioned in another review, it that it is heavy, however you can switch the brush exposure from bottom of the machine to the front of the machine. This enables you to run the machine vertically (on it's nose) and this removes the weight fromn your hand and arm,Great for carpeted stairs."
2,To Heavy,Unit works ok but it is to heavy and awkward to handle. Not balanced. Must twist wrist downward to vac and the heavyest part of the vac is on the back so one is having to apply pressure from with the other hand on the suctions area all the time. I have other uprights of this brand and like them a lot. Good pick up and cleaning but the design on this one is not good. Thumbs down!
3,Heavy and Clunky,"This machine has a lot of power, but it is very heavy and clunky, so it only gets 3 stars. I prefer a longer nosed ""dustbuster"". This seems to be better suited for apholstery.Anyway, it just didn't suit my needs."
3,Lots of power,"This vacuum has a lot of power, more power than I wanted. I wanted it to vacuum the dog hair off the couch cover. It would be great if I didn't use a cover on the couch. I kept it, but don't use it for what I originally want to use it for."
4,It works,"Great for pet hair. Very good power. It's weight will take a little getting used to. On furniture with looser fabric, the vacuum power sucks in the fabric thereby stopping the roller. Hence, one must tip the unit up or back in order to prevent this. On carpet it's just fine."
2,Getting rid of it,The suction power decreases quickly - even when cleaning off the filter after every other use. Well actually that is the problem - I don't want to clean the filter regularly. And trying to find a replacement filter has been a pain. Ask yourself what you want a small hand vac for - if you only need very light cleaning once in awhile then this is fine - but for anything greater I would look elsewhere.
5,This thing sucks...in a good way!,"Mighty little hand vac...was pretty amazed. Very convenient and well-designed. Made in China...yuck. Otherwise, an excellent little investment. Seems like the power of an upright in a handvac...it feels like you're running a power drill rather than a vacuum - just seems really powerful. Picked up a bunch of junk in the filter easily. (How do dogs shed so much?) Also did well using the attachment. So besides the compact design, the best thing about this is just the great amount of power; it's not extremely noisy either. Well made! So now, let's make 'em in Ohio or something..."
4,Small but powerful!,"This vacuum is great. By far the best hand held i have ever used. Small but powerful. The motorized sweeper is a great bonus. The only con (and why i have rated it 4 stars and not 5) is that it is corded and not battery powered. If this vacuum was battery powered, it would be perfect."
5,Get this one - great vac.,"I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Excellent little hand held vac that REALLY works. I have an American Eskimo dog, a Pekingese, and a white cat - with all these fur babies in my house, I needed help with fur on the stairs and furniture and this vac came to my rescue! It has power unlike other handheld vacs I've tried and is lightweight for the stairs. I absolutely love it. I can't wait to use it in my car. GREAT value. Get this one!"
5,works,cons: doesn't hold muchisn't cordless which is pain - i could have just used a regular vacuum insteadthe insert gets dirty and isn't washable since it will melt in the washing machine and then you need to buy another one.pros: smallworks wellnot really worth the money if you have a regular vacuum
4,Powerful little vacuum,"This is a great little vacuum for the price. I like the long cord and how powerful it is. It is a little heavy, and the hose is short for using the crevice tool. Felt like I had to have the vacuum right on top of the spot I wanted to vacuum. Still worth 4 stars!"
1,not a good buy,"This vacuum lost suction already and I've only had it for two weeks. The filter was extremely dirty from only vacuuming the steps, which are hard wood. I only purchase this item because of the great ratings it has but please do not waste your money;in my case, it's best to carry the large vacuum I currently have that has been around for over six years and it's still going. Too bad it's so heavy. What a waste of money!!!!"
1,Not impressed,"I bought this because of all the great reviews, but I am not impressed. It doesn't work well on carpet and even worse on floors. Also, it is corded, which is a bit of a pain, though I thought it would give it more power than a cordless vacuum (not so much). It is definitely not worth the money. I am giving up and replacing mine."
3,Had a bad day,"I thought that the tension in the wall would adjust power automatically in Sweden when I started the machine. Unfortunately, the tension were too strong and the vacuum was broken, but the little I could see was how powerful it was just when I started it."
5,Great little vacuum!,Great vacuum. I have two dogs and a fabric couch that dog hair is drawn to. I use this vacuum to remove pet hair from the couch and area rugs; also great for doing the stairs and not lugging around a heavy vacuum. For the price and quality of product I would recommend to anyone!
4,"I loved it, but...","This is the second one that's died in two years. Granted, I abuse it. I have two carpeted areas that are about 8x10, plus stairs, and we use it instead of a canister vacuum. So probably I shouldn't have expected it to act like a canister. I'm sorry I killed it; it was a terrific little machine for a mini-vacuum!"
4,Great Product,"Almost a 5-star product. I purchased this vacuum to get pet hair out of my vehicle and off my furniture. It does a great job with almost every surface. The exception was the back of my car seats, which are covered by fabric with fine, tangled fibers - pet hair is literally woven into the fabric.The one item lacking is a soft-bristle attachment for the hose to use when cleaning areas that need a bit of 'dusting' as they are vacuumed. If the 71B had come with that attachment, I'd have given it a 5-star rating."
5,I love this little vac,"Lost my little Hoover in Katrina, and looked everywhere for one that I would like. After reading reviews on this little vac, I decided to give it a try. Great little vac, a little heavy, but for the end result it is worth a little heaviness. I highly recommend this product, and it beats out the little Hoover. Much more powerful. I give it ten stars."
4,Eureka power,"I purchased the Eureka 71A hand held vac after reading the various reviews on this site. They are accurate. It DOES suck - and that is a good thing! Vacuums are supposed to do that and this one does it well. We have a bunch of dogs and I often just need a quick pick up of hair and other stuff that they drag in from outdoors. The on board crevice tool is handy. The only thing that I would say is a drawback is that the hose, when used in the right hand is either short(it is on the left of the machine) or if you turn vac then you blow the exhaust right at what you are trying to suck up. I do love the machine tho. It is easy to use, has lots of power and the cord is long enough to go everywhere I need it to go."
4,Wow! This thing really sucks!,"Out of the box, the first thing you notice is how heavy this little beast is. I bought it strictly for stairs, and with a full flight, it's a bit of an arm workout. That said, it's completely worth it - this little vac has extreme power. It was eating the stairs so hard last night I actually felt like it would pull out of my hand. The riser visor feature is fantastic as well - a great idea from Eureka!Would be 5 stars if not for the heavy weight, but again, it's worth it. My stairs have never been as clean."
4,Just what we needed,"The Eureka 71B is filling the bill perfectly. 2 dogs + 3 cats = hairy mess. Forget those sticky paper rolls and the not-so-handy + not so effective rubber, felt, or plastic gizmos. The attachments on my [very] expensive vacuum cleaner lay unused because it's so cumbersome. Now THIS is a solution worth talking about. Yes the filter gets dirty quickly - that's the nature of a hand-held vacuum. Doesn't matter, I still love this powerful handheld. Purchase an additional filter, and you're ready to go. I've used an inexpensive hair brush to help pull off the fine dust after shaking off the pet hairs. Haven't noticed any damage to the filter."
4,"Heavy. So far, so good.","My stairs have never been cleaner. Love the rotating brush. However, they unit is quite heavy for a one-arm operation. I saw others said it was really loud; I didn't think it was more than what was expected."
5,The Amazing Cat Hair Machine,"I have gone through many vacuums trying to find something that picks up ground in cat hair. This machine really works! I cannot imagine any machine that works any better than this! I saw other reviews complaining it was too heavy, but I didn't think is was too heavy. I love it and was compelled to write a review in favor of it."
