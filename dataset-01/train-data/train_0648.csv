3,is a little sensative: /,"Got this to link up 2 gba sp, and while in the end it did work, it was a little tricky to get working and dropped connectivity a few times. The plugs are a real tight fit, so it seemed i was having to shove it in a bit hard, and one slight movement and it would drop connectivity.For the price it was worth it, however expect some trouble at first."
5,Outstanding writing!,"The Strand Magazine is a surprising treasure. I was concerned that it might be nothing more than a cheap attempt to capitalize on the original Strand of Conan Doyle's day. I took a chance and could not be more pleased. I find the writing to be at a level well above what is typically found in today's periodicals - or novels, for that matter. It features excellent stories, insightful reviews and ads for books that actually interest me. Subscribe to The Strand and enjoy the works of authors who respect the intelligence of their readers!"
3,Good Magazine Lousy Customer Service,"I've been a Strand subscriber for 3 years now and it's been a constant battle getting each issue. I have to contact the Strand's customer service every quarter and inquire as to why I didn't get the latest issue. The last time I renewed I foolishly did it for 2 years at a cost of $35. I have received one issue so far and all I'm told is give it a few weeks. Weeks have turned into months and still no magazine. Even though I like the Strand I will never subscribe to it again. They haven't a clue what ""Customer Service"" means!"
5,One Stop Shopping for the latest in Mysteries,"The Strand is an excellent resource for the latest in the mystery genre. Book reviews,author short stories, and interviews are the highligts for me. I even enjoy the advertisments because they focus on the latest mysteries hitting the shelves. The only disappointment is that it is only published four times a year - so sad!!!!"
2,Too late and poor customer service,The idea behind the magazine is good and the stories interesting. the book reviews are helpful and the interviews are enjoyable. However it takes an unbelievably long time for the copies of the magazine to reach you even bearing in mind the quarterly nature of the magazine. If you email customer service (the only way of contacting them) the problem is the custoners rather than the company's even when magazines don't arrive. They claim to have posted magazines and then when the magazines do arrive they have a post mark showing they have been posted after your contact. Better customer service would result in a better rating. Took 16 weeks for first copy to arrive and eventually gave up subscription as life is too short to wait for second copy.
4,if bill forsyth had been spanish ...,"jorge sanz (a looker) stars as a soldier deserting from the spanish army during the 1930s civil wars, taken into a family, who proceeds to fall in love with and seduce all four daughters, while forging a father/son relationship with the patriarch. touching and kinky and off beat, a worthy winner of the oscar as best foreign language film in 1992."
2,high hopes not met,"I like romantic comedy. I like Spanish films. I am not a prude. I did not like this movie. There was very little character development. The plot consists almost entirely of him briefly hooking up with 4 different sisters. Should I be happy for his discovery of free love? Think he's a sleaze? He seems to be somewhere in the middle, just bumbling along.And what am I to think of the sister who accepts his profession of love for her and only her after she's watched him declare his love for the other 3? Is the wedding in the end a happy ending? I can't decide because I don't know what to think of the people who get married.Maybe it is all a political allegory that I don't get because I know so little about this period in Spanish history."
4,A bit on the corny side.,"I read several of the other reviews and I had to add my 2 cents worth. The movie is intertaining but pretty corny. There is actually nothing in the plot that is believable or realistic. If you do not know something of the Spanish civil war, you will not understand some of the humor or dialog. As I watched the film, it reminded me of the humor of the three stoodges. Much of the humor is along those lines (corny) but of a sexual nature and irreverent nature (this in keeping with one of the main issues of the civil war). If you are Catholic or somewhat prudish, you will not like this film at all."
3,Entertaining and funny.,"Belle Epoque was a comical movie, but I would'nt say it's the best. The language was at times hard to understand even though I speak spanish. Plus why is the title in French? If the character of Fernando had not been so funny and the actor himself so comical, I would have bored myself. The story seems very deja vue of other films. Still, it did entertain so I recommend it if your into foreign films."
3,Trying to be cute,"Film set in 1930s Spain at the time of great political changes in the country. Young (former) seminary student who deserted from the Spanish Army is trying to get a new start in life. Circumstances bring him to a house of a man who has four (4) daughters: one is a young widow, another is engaged, the third one is a lesbian, while the youngest one is a virgin. As this young, confused man is jumping to bed with each one of them, hoping for love, it is less comical and more boring to observe a poor creature trapped in he house of women who is treated as a sex toy and yet gets lucky to marry the youngest one. Too unbelievable to be taken in even as a comedy. One of the early roles for (then) young Penelope Cruz."
5,Spanish film-making at its best.,"This is one of the finest movies I've ever seen. It is funny, unique, and truly entertaining. Not just for fans of Spanish movies and culture, it will be enjoyed by all who watch it! Add it to your collection, you won't be disappointed (but make sure you avoid the dubbed version)."
5,"Elegant, funny, sexy, sophisticated, and very ""French-like""","Belle Epoque reminds of a traditional French-style cinema, just like the title itself.It is a story of basically decent, but very confused young man (incredibly cute one, too), whose only concern is how to survive amidst the chaos of Spanish Civil War.The film begins with this young man, Fernando, almost being killed, but it ends with him being very much alive and happy. In the process, Fernando meets a lot of new people: an old man, Manolo, and his unconventional family, to say the least. The relationship between Manolo and Fernando takes a special place in the story, along with Fernando's amorous interest in Manolo's daughter(s).Apart from love and youth, Belle Epoque is also looking at Spain's historical background and hypocritical nature of society during the Great Spanish Civil War.Overall, Belle Epoque is both visually appealing and very philosophical, at the same time. It is a real masterpiece."
4,Bawdy and Sexy Spanish Comedy!,"This is an entertaining romantic comedy. It is funny, sexy, saucy and inventive spanish film. The movie never gets heavy, it manages to be a light, fluff of a comedy with an excellent premise (4 beautiful women, every man's dream!). If you liked this movie I recommend 'Cinema Pardiso', 'Il Postino' or 'Like Water For Chocolate'. From a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a 7!"
4,SEDUCTIVELY FUN,"A Spanish army deserter runs away and stays with a man who has four beautiful daughters. If I am not mistaken (it has been a while since I saw the film) he wants to study for the priesthood or had in the past studied for the priesthood, so he had lustful feelings about the daughters but despite his urges did not act on them. However, he was surprised to find that the girls were each aggressive in their own ways, and he found himself easily seduced... by each of them! Penelope Cruz stars here in one of her earliest roles. She of course has become an American star now, with her roles in All the Pretty Horses with Matt Damon and the upcoming Vanilla Sky with Tom Cruise and Captain Corelli's Mandolin with Nicolas Cage. Belle Epoque is a beautiful and tantalising film, and it won best foreign film Oscar in the early 90s. (Sorry I don't remember which year)."
5,Funny,"I recently watched this movie and I believe it is the best Spanish movie I have seen. I would not call this fluff, not only was the movie hilarious, it also presented quite a lot of insight into Spanish history and had a really good cast of characters. Jorge Sanz manages to give the lead character a mixture of vulnerability and manliness that is just irresistible, you can see why all the sisters are falling head over heels for him. Ariadna Gil gives a great performance as gender-confused Violeta, I thought she acted just like a man. Juanito and his mother, the comic relief characters, were just hilarious. Can't go wrong with this one."
5,Great Mouse,"Small, portable, easy to connect, great battery life, helpful pouch, and good color and body. Dont use it daily but so far its running great."
2,6 months life,"worked good for almost six months. Suddenly one day it changed its mind,and never worked again. spent almost 30 dollar in walmart. will not go with Targus again."
1,"Works for a while, then watch out","I bought this mouse a couple years ago. Worked fine for about 9 months then started cutting out now and then. Talked with Targus directly and after trying all they asked me to do to see if it'd work again, they sent me out a new mouse. Now just over a year after getting the new one the mouse is not working again. Come to find out there are wires that travel through the part that pivots on the receiver and the wires have been cut from repeated normal wear-and-tear use. Have a call into service department to see what they can do about it. Would not recommend this for everyday use."
5,Wireless Targus mouse,Mouse worked great for about a year and then the USB Receiver started to act up. Only working when it was in a unique position.I like it well enough to order a replacement USB Receiver part. Hope it works as well as it has in the past for another year or more.
1,Do not buy,"Just recieved this the other day.mouse is clunky, does not track well, and the rechargable batteries that came with it did not charge at all, had to use my own non-rechargable batteries to use it.the wireless reciever does not work well, if its hinge is rotated at all while plugged in it loses connection for a few seconds, and all in all its not a good buy for the price, for its regular price ($36) you could buy a nice microsoft or logitec mouse. dont waste your time with this"
2,Do not buy.,"This mouse worked for about 3 months before failing. If you only need it for short-term use, then it's a good buy. Don't buy it if you want a mouse that will last any longer."
2,mouse,very unhappy with the product i opened it to put batteries in it and the lock broke now i have to tape it to use it
2,Perfect For Fifth Grade,"The average middle or high school student knows 90 % of the word in Courses II and III. For maximum effectiveness, it should be as a way to have 5th graders build a vocabulary base for their middle and high school years."
3,Not as good as the 1st Music release,"The best of Stargate SG-1 is infact a 9 track compilation of the 1st 2 seasons of the TV show. It's really not the best of Stargate. I rather enjoyed the 1st release namely called Music of Stargate SG-1 and the actual movie music-score. However I still enjoyed the music from several episodes of the 2nd season, most notable being the music suite of Hathor.A fan of the TV show should be pleasantly surprised by the suites in this CD. It won't disapoint."
2,Biased and personal.,"I have every book written by Carter. This one is probably the most biased and self-opinionated. I have a hard time digesting his point of view. He advocates sticking to beliefs (quoted Lewis or some other as though they are prophets or supreme beings ??).I think we all know religion (to some) is paramount. I don't think we can disregard that most wars are fought on the premise of religion neither. Politics change over change because we human do. If he thinks religion needs to have an influence, then religion needs to evolve with time- whether according to him, this is compromise or not, it is still a fact !I do not recommend this book at all."
4,Interesting book,"I needed another perspective in the religio-political debate. Stephen Carter is a bright, thinking,schilarly man even if I don't agree with some of his points of view."
2,A slow waltz through the psychology of investing,"This book has a good heart, but I can't recommend it so highly. The author takes several classical cognitive mistakes that humans make (some will recognize the classic names of Kahnemann and Tversky; they are one of the substrates of this book). The author applies such mistakes to a wide range of investment problems - holding on to losing stocks too long, anthropomorphizing stock decisions, and so on. The sort of psychology that makes you think that a coin that has flipped tails three times now has a 95% chance of flipping heads on the next toss. Most intelligent readers (the sort that buy Harvard Press books) could get the same points in a much briefer format, like a book chapter or a 10-page article. For example, people tend not to save enough for retirement because the future seems a long time away and they think they'll catch up and it will work out. Well, yes. Next?"
3,Good product,Fruit & Veggie is a great addition for juicing. What I find frustrating is the container comes 2/3rds empty. Using a large container is very misleading. In fact is is quite a ripoff. I would recommend shopping around to find more value for your hard earned cash.
5,This is the greatest!,"I gave this to my brother for Christmas and it was a big hit. The instruments are well made and beautifully packaged. He told me the tea was great - they even include some African honey. They shipped really fast, too.You're not only giving a great gift but you are donating money to a great cause. I can't recommend this enough."
2,Disappointing,"I purchased Family Word Finder on the sole recommendation of one rave review, by one writerly person. What I expected was a replacement for my cumbersome, but comprehensive, Roget's Thesaurus. The big appeal was the dictionary style look up.Searching for a word is easy, just as I'd hoped. However, half the words I tried to find are simply absent. It might make a nice gift for a grade-schooler. Too bad I don't know one.Back to Roget's."
5,Believe Me.,"Believe me this book is a must have for writers, students, professional and anyone who wants to add new words to their vocabulary. I've been using this book since I was a teenager when I began writing poetry. Now while working on my first novel I'm still using it. I also like to just read it for information and I find that the section that gives the origin of the words to be interesting. If you purchase this book you'll find that it's much more than your standard word finder."
5,Disappointed Out of Print,"I am a licensed interpreter. I am continually analyzing words in order to interpret them. This is the best word reference book I have ever owned. I wanted to buy a couple copies for gifts and was disappointed to find out it was out of print. If you can find a copy, grab it."
3,decent puzzle game,"Charlie Blasts Territory is a different kind of puzzle game. You use boxes and bombs to try to have the most territory when time runs out. The one player mode gets impossible after the first few levels and the graphics are simple, thus preventing the game from being great. The sound is mediocre and the control is real touchy. The best part of the game is the multiplayer mode. It can be fun for a couple of hours playing against other people and seeing who can set off the best chain reaction and gain the most territory. Overall, it's not too bad for a puzzle game but it's not by any means one of the best. I'd recommend giving it a try by renting it for a weekend, but it's not really worth buying."
4,A must for the RM6200 package,"The Polk Rm6200 Home Theater package can stand alone but matchedwith the PSW250 makes any listening format come alive. Unlike most powered subs on the market, the PSW250 adds the right touch of low end effects without overpowering the mids,and highs. Polk goes the extra mile to match the sub to the home theater package of your choice. Any Polk product you choose will give you years of listening enjoyment."
3,70's REDUX,"Andre K, like fellow orchestra leader Percy Faith, is a versatile arranger, who changed with the times. This double CD shows his expertise in such change.Sadly, the choice of material isn't that impressive. The best tracks: Billy Joel's ROOT BEER RAG; Barry White's LOVE'S THEME; Jerome Kern's ALL THE THINGS YOU ARE; Gloria Gaynor's NEVER CAN SAY GOODBYE; Jerry Goldsmith's sumptious THEME FROM CHINATOWN; the rest are pretty average.Thanks to oldies.com for putting Andre and Percy's best on CD."
5,In My Top 20 All-Time,"Kalifornia is one of my top 20 favorite all-time films, even though the X-files guy is weak as ususal.... everyone else is excellent."
4,intriguing,"I've seen this one twice, it's much like Kiss The Girls, freakish and intriguing at the same time, one you can watch over and over"
2,"Kalifornia ""more like ""Kill ifornia""","Not one of Brad Pitts stellar perfromances. He is carried through by his co-stars. If my lady did not insist on watching ithe end, I would have stopped it at the half way point and sent it packing. The movie is long and drawn out with little conviction and action in between long boring drama segments."
3,ATMOSPHERIC AND PSYCHOTIC,"David Duchovny is an East Coast writer writing a book on mass murderers. But he's blocked. So he talks his photographer girlfriend into illustrating the intended tome and going with him to California visiting famous murder sites along the way. They advertise for riding partners. Luckily for them, they get grease-ball white trash killer Brad Pitt who skips parole and joins them along with his simpering child-woman girlfriend (a fantastic Juliette Lewis). Atmospheric and psychotic, it reeks and revels in the evil that attracts and seduces the relatively innocent. No answers to what makes evil so attractive: maybe it's the fascination with the irrational."
5,great movie,This flick in my opinion is Brad Pitt's best work. It is getting very hard to find in stores so happy i found a copy.
4,"Great film, a cult classic!","what a performance by juliette Lewis and especially Brad Pitt, the guy can clearly act, I had never seen or heard of this movie before, and here I am 19 years later writing a review about it. After seen this film you'll know why David Duchovny never made it made big on the big screen, just terrible, awful performance, could not have been worst. But once again the brilliant performance by Pitt more than make up for the boring and pointless plot and the awful performances by David Duchovny and Michelle Forbesof, his character is so dark, that you completely forget that he is Brad Pitt, his performance in this film is reminiscent to Robert DeNiro in Taxi Driver. Definitely a must watch, and definitely a cult classic!"
3,Not a bad thriller; Michelle Forbes is terrific,"So-so thriller starring Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis, who join David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes on a road trip out west. The latter couple are researching notorious murder sites for an upcoming book; Pitt's a serial killer on the lam (unbeknownst to Dave) and Juliette is his poor, not-all-there companion. This is a good cast and the story moves along, but Pitt isn't belivably scary as a serial killer, although it is one of his better earlier roles. The best thing is here is Michelle Forbes, who always manages to shine, whether in her roles on `Homicide: Life on the Street' or in the brief series `Wonderland.'"
4,Brad Pitt's best role!,"Brad Pitt, Juliette Lewis, David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes. Now that's a pretty impressive list of actors for a movie. And as I stated in the title, this is Brad Pitt's best roll. The story is equally good. There really is nothing about this movie that I did not find above average. If you like suspence thrillers you will love this movie."
4,Solid film with a standout performance by Lewis,"Kalifornia is a film that deserves to be seen. The key to the film's successs lies in Sena's (the director) emphasis on the present, not bogging the story down with tales of Early's(Pitt)childhood abuse or other such ""reasons"" for his insanity. We are not spoon fed a story but left to draw our own conclusions from what we are given. It is not a film about a serial killer but a film that asks who is capable of going crazy. This is not a question Sena or anyone can answer therefore it is rightfully left to the thoughts of the viewer. Lewis gives a heartbreaking performance as Adel, one that shouldn't be missed, while Pitt gives another excellent performance. Duchovny is Duchovny and that works well in his role, while Michelle Forbes gives a solid performance as well. Kalifornia is a great social commentary, not on serial killing, but on people in this country that have been neglected, left to sort through their societal rejection in a violent manner"
2,Missing some a little bit too much,"This DVD there aren't that many performances and maybe two or three really good ones. The name of the DVD is ""The San Francisco Sound"" well they are missing some of the some of the really good artists that would have made the DVD actually sound like the ""San Francisco Sound"". Just a couple of bands are missing such as Jefferson Airplane, The Doors, and a few others. But luckily they are found on ""The Sixties"" DVD which is a better deal."
3,Reeds,"Worked as required. I thought these were very expensive, but required for school. Its like movie theatre pricing, they screw you because they know they have you."
4,Clarinet reeds,I bought these for my daughter who wanted to try a new brand of reeds. She likes the sound from these reeds but she also says that it is harder to use them. They also do not last as long as her old brand.
3,you get what you get and you don't get upset,I always say the best Vandoren reed beats the best reed of any other brand. The only problem is the best Vandoren reed comes around once in a blue moon. I wish they would save the time they spend on individual packaging and labeling and put it into making each box a little more consistent.
4,Cheaper than the music store,"My oldest son is learning the Clarinet for the school band. He seems to 'eat' reeds, or at least knaw on them. They seem to get nicked up easily, an the local music shop want $3 a reed. I went bulk, and am happy I did."
4,Good Reeds,Their sound lives up to the Vandoren reputation and are easy to play on. Thank you very much for such a quality product!
5,great price,great price for reeds. definitely come back again and again and again. son can't decide on which strength he likes most but it's worth it.
5,great oasis psychedelia,"""Who feels Love""- a great late 60's influenced psychedelic track which is quite outstanding. The B-side, is a decent song as well. ""Helter Skelter""- nice Beatles cover, oasis does a fairly good job of covering this classic White Album track. Plus its got the music video of ""who feels love"" on the disc."
4,Really 4.5,A good read that makes you think. He takes the medical thing off in a new direction. Not what you expect.
3,Sinister,"The Ingraham is recruiting again. They are looking for bright young pre-med students to live on campus and complete their education. Free. What's the catch? A clue may be the patients on one floor of the facility no one's supposed to see. They are bandaged from head to toe, unable to move, unable to speak. Only their eyes cry out for help. Are they truly burn victims, as the young students are told? Or is there something sinister happening at the Ingraham? Quinn Cleary wants a chance to complete med school, and a chance to help these people."
3,The Select,I liked the book okay but I feel it is a lot of fear mongering about the big bad government wanting to limit healthcare. What the book doesn't say or cover is how the insurance companies are dictating health care or how much pharmaceutical companies spend on advertising as opposed to the research and development the industry claims. Much of research and development of drugs is paid for with taxpayers money.The story is pretty good and the writing is fine but we are left with a lot of questions unanswered at the end.
4,<shiver>,The scariest aspect of all the best medical theories is how easily the fiction of the story could be front page news or a police report. Wilson does a great job of illustrating this.I've always said that the world's monsters aren't hiding under the bed. Thanks to the author I will be keeping an extra close eye on my doctors.
4,Robin Cook clone,"This book was quite interesting but was not up to par with his previous work.While I'd recommend this book to friends,I'd tell them to read ""The Keep"" if they wanted to read Wilson at his best"
4,Very suspenseful,I thought this book was extremely suspenseful from beginning to end. It certainly is a fast read..not a great literary work but fun and exciting. Take it to the beach or on a plane trip and have some page turning fun!
4,The Select,I came across a gem when I purchased this book at a thrift store. Wow!! What a medical thriller. This book keeps you on the edge of your seat. You never know where F. Paul Wilson will take you. This is a great book--a guaranteed suspense read.
5,One of the best works of fiction I have ever read.,"The mere possibility of the events depicted in F. Paul Wilson's book 'The Select' makes one of the best, and scariest, books I have ever read. The book is written with knowledge that could only come from a man with first-hand experience in the medical profession. This novel is a page-turner from the beginning. It picks you up and sweeps you away, leaving you soaked long after you've finished. Wilson does not clog the pages with medical mumbo-jumbo that would leave the seasoned reader confused, but delights your senses with clever innuendoes and metaphors. This is a must-read for fans of medical thrillers."
1,bad product,i don't know why they call it PH UP when it fail to bring PH up. it just a waste of my good money.
1,sorry i purchased in ignorance,"when starting a new aquarium i thought that I ""needed"" this and ph down to regulate my tank; but after getting professional advise from a reliable source was educated to know how to cycle my tank correctly and using such chemicals are only temporary not fixes and often cause more problems than they fix. So these will just sit there as they serve no need for me..."
4,"Shinage-Ryu, the lost art.......","You would think this is a lost art but,far from it! It gives you a new awarness of the style and finesse the Japanese had with their sword arts.Very well done!"
5,nEW rADICALS rOCK!!!!,"Dear Readers of this note, I love the New Radicals, and I hope that you do too! If anyone knows a web address to find out the lyrics to their song,""You Get What You Give,""please e*mail me about it!!!! Thank you so much New Radicals fans! Bye!!!!!!"
3,It's not Dune,"The Dune series by Frank H. is probably my favorite read. I've read through the entire series several times since 1977. Whipping Star is fun, but it doesn't go into the intimate detail as Dune and maybe I was expecting too much of this book. For me, it was almost predictable. I did enjoy how he explained time and space."
4,Professional Obstructors Meet Supernova Who Just Needs Love,This was a clever book starring bureaucrats whose job is to intentionally derail governmental productivity and a sweet giant supernova named Caliban who just needs a little love. Together they must stop a wealthy & aristocratic S/M Mistress from destroying interstellar transportation. Reading this book will cause you to giggle like a madwoman.
3,Okay,"When I first got this video game, I was really excited and I downloaded it onto my pc right away. It was fun for the first couple of weeks, but then I got to playing it all the time that I knew how to win all of the challenges, and I knew when the tribes were going to switch and merge. It became very boring. The tribal council is probably the best part of the game, because it's the only suspencful part of the game. The challenges are only for YOU to play, you don't get any help from your tribe mates. The only way to pick someone to vote off is if you don't like them or if you don't have a chance to save them because everyone is voting them off. I do recemmend this game to people who really like to play video games over and over, but I don't EXTREMELY recemmdend it!! Sorry..."
4,GREAT GAME,"The game itself has improved a lot from last time. The graphics and challenges are great and fun. In addition, this time you can actually make REAL alliances. However, the challenges take very very long time to load. For me, each challenge takes about 20 minutes to load and some even take 45 minutes. But overall, it's a fantastic game to play!"
2,Better than original Survivor,"I hardly ever saw Survivor but I got tired of my original Survivor I badly wanted this version and Santa granted my wish. I played my first game yesterday and boy was I amazed. I just loved the new opening sequence because it made me feel like I was watching the TV show. Plus it has a feature that the original Survivor lacks a practice version that lets you play the challenges over and over agan. That way if you lose or if you don't know what to do head over to the practice version. By the way my favorite challenge is the slots. Also the TC is improved with Jeff Probst actually reads the votes and the torches are brought now. .... The reason I gave this game 2 stars was that I missed making my own tribe member. Overall a fun game,Buy it,...!!! SURVIVOR FAN !!!"
5,This game is awsome,I love this game. I am probably the biggest survivor fan you will ever find. This game shouldn't even be compared because there is no reason to. The best part of the game for me is the tribal council. The graphics are way better than the first one.One thing that i don't like is that there is no way to control if your tribe likes you or not. I'm tired of winning a bunch of challenges for my tribe then go to look at there attitudes toward me and most of them are unfavorable towards me. But I still think this game is the best game pc game I've played.
2,Not that great,"i agree, the first couple times playing are really fun. than it just gets repetive and non-challenging. i wish tribal council was more suspeseful; and i wish the allinaces actually made sense. also, i think its studpid that you are always competing against the marquesas cast. i hope a new edition comes out, hopefully it will be a lot better. i don't reccommend the game to those who aren't survivor fans."
1,doesn't run,"We were so excited to get this game, however it will not load and run properly. The tech support staff at Infogrames has been very helpful, but to no avail. I would not recommend this game to anyone."
1,I REALLY REALLY WISH I COULD HATE THIS GAME,"Being one of my most wanted items on the top of my Christmas wish list last year I was really happy when my Survivor game arrived courtesy of Santa himself and I couldn't wait to play it. The day after Christmas the trouble began as the game froze while trying to load an immunity challenge and I ended up starting the game again and the day after that the game froze AGAIN at the very same part and starting the game over again was very tiring for me. Finally tired of messing with the game i took Survivor out and popped in the Sims and I was really happy. Mark Burnett should be really ashamed of what Infogames has really done to the computer games of his creation. And people and diehard Survivor fans will be disappointed with this game. Let The buyer beware,P.S. Mark Burnett could you ask Infogames to create a game starring my crush Rocco Dispirito plese?"
5,This is a TERRIFIC game!!!!,"I had reviewed the first ""Survivor: The Interactive Game"". I got it from the library and I thought that it was ok. I didn't like the survival periods. But now, to ""Survivor: Ultimate"". This is such a big improvment since the last game! At tribal council, the graphics are much better. And instead of a video of Jeff snuffing a torch, he actually does it!! Although, it is somewhat like the first game. It DOES repeat challenges, not always in the same order. But still. And they actually say in the manual that your alliances keep for one episode. And the alliances actually keep! If you are in the final four, if two people have a set person, that person that they planned to vote off, votes for him/herself! But overall, this is a HUGE improvment since the last game. I just wish they had one with Rupert in it! Hopefully then, he wouldn't get voted off."
1,One statement....,"... they better have fixed the bugs the first one had. Im hoping this one will actually be stable. If not, alot of fans will vote Infogrames out of the gaming industry."
1,DENSE!,This book is very dense are hard to read. I had to use it in one of my classes and even the teacher decided not to use it because the information in the book is rather cryptic and hard to sort out from the rest of the mess that the book is.
2,Book-CD Deluxe Edition a disappointment!,"I was shocked that a $34.98 book/cd was so small and has only nine paperboard type pages of art work. The ""silver bell"" in this package (as in another book set and the Lionel train set that I bought) is a cheap metal chrome plated bell and in no way resembles the beautiful bell illustrated in the books and movie. Surely someone will make an exact replica before next season.The book should be priced at no more than $18 - a typical top line CD. Of course the music is fine....but consider buying the music CD only....for a lot less money! Better, wait for a clsoe out sale on this item!"
3,CD is great!,"The book is just pictures from the movie with some captions. I think the book is useless, but the CD is great. The jinglebell included is small and makes more noise hitting the plastic that surrounds it than actual ""bell"" noise."
4,Good for Fans of Angelina!,"This is a good book if your daughter (or son) likes Angelina, but it is not a great children's book. The writing and illustrations are solid but not extraordinary."
5,Angelinas Christmas,"My granddaughter loved the book, also got her the doll, she plays with it all the time. Very happy with the book."
4,Fight in the Fields,"This is a book based upon the successful PBS/Sundance Film of the same name. While it has several wonderful attributes (some excellent and rare pictures), it does not stand up to the earlier work of London and Anderson in So Shall Ye Reap. In reality, this is more of a biography of Cesar Chavez than a careful review of agricultural labor history. In the end, I would buy it again/"
4,Another brilliant work,"In this second volume of the love trilogy, hooks has absolutely touched upon all of the issues that eat away at black love in our modern, successful nation. I remain amazed at bell's marriage to truth-telling in the name of improving our collective lot. As a New Yorker, however, I can't help but wonder why there is such an enormous focus on the imagined 'black community' and a presentation time and again of a world that is only populated by blacks and whites. And I was particularly saddened by the lack of discussion of non-African American blacks, a growing number of the black people in this country. I don't believe that any of bell's insights or strategies presented in this work are necessarily peculiar to black people--they are all brilliant and could apply to all peoples. And brava for devoting an entire chapter to discussing the acceptance of gayness in black life!"
2,Where's the Salvation?,"I bought Salvation hoping Ms. hooks would give definitive ways to address the problems we are having in the Black community. It was informative and somewhat repetitive. Her feminist view came through and in part I disagree with some of her feminist views. In our search for equality, we as women, black women are still left out. Just as the civil rights movement let doors open we closed doors on our own selves when it was unnecessary.Like any movement, there is a fallout and backlash. Ms. hooks addressed some valid points, such as Love being the answer to our problems in the Black community. However, she gave no real steps, nothing concrete that can be taken into the community and used. We have talked and talked out our problems and even addressed some solutions. Now we need definitive steps and even examples to lead us out of the sex wars between our people."
3,Biology of the Invertebrates,"This book made invert zoo boring and lifeless. It hardly did justice to the commonly overlooked invertebrates. The book is entirely in black and white (including photos) which is a shame considering the price of it. Although the book was thorough, I felt the author skipped around. Important terms would only be briefly mentioned and then the author may or may not discuss them in further pages/chapters. I do feel that the author attempted to gear the book towards bio students who had to take an invert zoo class rather than solely to students majoring in invert. Overall a good book but I used wikipedia more than the book because it was lacking. I wouldn't recommend purchasing the book unless necesary for a class."
4,"Good, but could use better images","The text for this book is very clear and easy to understand. That said, the images and illustrations could definitely use an up grade. I was very surprised when I opened the text book and realized that it was all printed in black and white with light blue accents. I have never had a biology text that was not full color before, and now I really appreciate that. The lack of full color makes some of the diagrams harder to understand then should be necessary, but other than that, it's a great little book."
5,Enjoyable and Eye Opening!,This was the best written and most enjoyable textbook I have ever had the pleasure of reading. It's easy to read and comprehend; all of the essential photos are there to help guide you! Not only does it give you a good understanding of invertebrates but it also gives an awesome background on why and how they came to evolve in certain ways. This is a book I would pick up and read in my free time! Great book all around!!
3,Thorough but boring,"The book is completely in black and white (and green) which makes ocean animals seem dull and lifeless. You do not get a true idea of what each species actually looks like. While it is completely thorough, the author has made marine life as interesting as the paper this book was printed on. A drag..."
4,Good but not great,"This is a pretty good work out shirt, loose and comfortable. I only gave it 4 stars though because of the price - which is high for what you are getting."
1,sucks,"i recently ordered a Large one, but it's bigger than large. i think it's like XL or something like that. i just waste $17. i wouldn't recommend this."
2,Not worth it!,"I have others UA products and they are really good, but this item that i've got it's not.I dont recommend, the material it's not like the others. Looks like a normal sleeve."
3,Not bad but sizes are way off,"The material is fine, breathes well, I just found the sizes way off for what appears to be a compression top.I first ordered a medium and it was like a tent! I then went for a small which still wasn't tight on me. I'm 185 lbs, 6'2 athletic build.I see another reviewer is 10 lbs lighter and says the medium fits fine - So I'm a bit confused! I gave the medium to a female friend who works out with my sometimes and she's 220 lbs and 5'6, it's not even a tight fit on her.I can't go any smaller in size so I've had to go for a different brand, a Nike top in small fits great (tight fit, compression). Unfortunately they cost about double the price.I'd have loved one of these another size or two down from their definition of ""small""."
5,Excellent Way to Keep Cool,"I live in Orlando, FL, and go to theme parks all the time. I'm a larger guy and I sweat very easily.I can't imagine going to a theme park without wearing this these days. It keeps me significantly cooler, and keeps me looking pretty decent, despite perspiring heavily.It's very comfortable to wear, and looks great under any standard button-up-the-front shirt I wear."
1,Disappointed,"This shirt definitely disappointed. All my work out shirts are cotton so I needed to upgrade especially since I am one to sweat. The reviews were overall good so I went for this one. But it did not deliver. Reviews claimed it was comfortable (reviewers even claimed to use this as lounge- and sleepwear) but it is not. At all. It is scratchy and rough and fibery. It's cut oddly so it has a strange shape, especially at the neckline and the rim. It has strings coming out of it. And to top it off, it's overpriced. Do not get this. Look elsewhere. I have not tried other UA products so these issues may or may not be restricted to this specific UA product but if I were looking to buy another work out shirt I would try a different brand."
3,Nice quality,"Brazil - Gramado - Rio Grande do SulFor me too large, thats ok I send back, I do recommend"
3,Too Big,"Ordered this as a Christmas gift for my brother. He normally wears a size large, but after reading other reviews I decided to go with the medium since it's loose fit and the pictures show a tighter compression shirt. I got it in the mail yesterday and my brother would swim in it. I'm afraid if I go with anything smaller though it would be too short. I got the heather gray and when you hold it up to a light, you can see right through the material. Also, I'm not sure if all UA shirts have this, but there's an iron on circle on the back of the shirt at the top that lists the size of the shirt. It just looks kind of cheap and like it doesn't belong. I'll be looking at my local sports store for a better quality shirt."
3,Loaded with detergents when new.,"I hand washed one of these shirts with no soap and it takes 20 minus plus just to get the detergents out. I have no idea why, when so many people have allergies, a company would leave tons of detergents on the fabric. The shirts are good quality but wow why do we need to but so many chemicals right on our skin? is it the chemicals in the shirt that make it shed sweat ? and if so what chemicals are in there ? it says 95 percent polyester 5% cotton on the garment. What are they not telling us ?"
4,Decent shirt,"The shirt is stretchy and thin, easy to exercise in.It is advertised as looking and feeling like cotton, which it doesn't. From a distance it may look like cotton, definitely not from close up. It feels less comfortable than a cotton shirt and isn't good to wear under other clothes. The Under Armour logos are made of rubber and are a bit annoying."
1,Cheap tee shirt,"This item is not the snug fitting, smooth feeling under armour heat gear I have come to love. This is a loose cut synthetic tee shirt. The material is very thin and cheap feeling. It has that itchy, plastic-like feel against the skin. The materials performance is irrelevant to me at this point since I don't even like putting it on. The shirts cut and style give it a very different range of applications than the traditional under armour apparel. This was my mistake. A similar quality synthetic ""tech"" tee shirt can be purchased at wal mart for much less than I paid for this thing."
1,armour my ass,"WARNING IT'S NOT ACTUALLY ARMOR, IT'S ARMOUR PROBABLY FRENCH BECAUSE THIS THING DOES NOT PROTECT AGAINTS BULLETS I LEARNED THE HARD WAY."
2,Not very form-fitting,I bought the large and was very disappointed with the fit. Very baggy- wears like a regular tshirt so it isn't worth the price at all.
4,Nice Shirt,Looking for a tee that would wick the sweat and this tee fits the bill. Only thing I didn't like was the way they attached the size tag to the back of the tee. It's not coming off trust me it's not.
4,Good loose-fitting moisture-wicking tee,This shirt is not skin tight or compression. I bought a large and it fit comfortably loose which allows for good range of arm and torso motion without impediments. Good for the gym and I'm sure it'll come in handy for basketball.The material is comfortable and has the patented under armour moisture wicking ability. The green color isn't even as ugly as some people make it out to be. It's a little duller and not neon green at all.The only con I see is the plastic feeling UA patch on the left breast. It feels like it'll fall off at any second.
3,Third one is on the way,"I haven't been able to use this oven enough to give an accurate review as I have received two both of which were damaged. The first one was cosmetic, but in three seperate areas on the MW. #2 arrived yesterday and you couldn't even open the door as there was buckled sheetmetal near the door open buttom, that wasn't in itself causing the door not to open, the internal mechanism was damaged. These MW have been taking a beating in warehouses for three years, as that is the manufacturing date on the units. It appears the internal packaging is not adequate to protect the heavy weight of the MW. Hopefully three times is a charm as I already have the mounting bracket installed on the wall, and it wasn't a easy DYI. Each manufacturer seems to have a different mounting bracket. My original with the house GE was way different than this Panasonic. I don't have many more areas on the wall to drill holes if this Panny doesn't work out and I have to go with another brand."
1,"Poor packaging, poor engineering","I went through five of these ovens. Those that were not unacceptably damaged because of poor packaging did not work. I am really surprised that Panasonic would not better package this product to avoid damage in shipment. Moreover, the fact I got two ovens that did not work, and the fact they have apparently been discontinued, suggests Panasonic had some design problems with this product. Too bad!"
4,An Incredible Deal!,"I took a chance on this microwave due to the low low low price and reasonable features it provided. The biggest question was if it would arrive in working condition due to not the greatest packing I read about in other reviews. When the carton showed up, it looked in good condition which was a relief. After opening the package, I noticed some of the foam packaging was cracked. The bottom line is that the unit had one small easily fixed problem- the top vent door (which opens and closes during microwave use) had been forced into the frame and I had to pry it out a small screwdriver. Check to see tht the door moves freely before installation and you're all set.This unit has now been in operation for several weeks and works perfectly. It looks great and offers a tremendous bang for the buck!"
3,Nice looking...Low Cost....but requires some work,"I do like this microwave even though I had to return the first one as the door would not open and the control did not work when I plugged it in. The second one worked when plugged in but the door would not open, so I read some of the reviews and I opened the mircowave control panel and found that the plastic part was off and all I had to do was reconnect it onto the push button/ control panel frame and everything wokred out well. The instructions to install the microwave are also incorrect and I found I had to drill larger holes than the 3/16 or the 3/8 mentioned in the installation instructions. The microwave does work fine and for the price you cannot beat it. So if you are willing to do some work yourself and save some money, I would recommend this microwave to anyone."
3,rural sprawl produces another lumbering adaptation of edna ferber,"as usual, edna ferber books are just too damned spread out to work as fully effective films, but they adapt as pretty good almosts. the first part of the movie, set in a late 1800s logging camp, work much better for me, with frances farmer way more credible as the bar girl than a generation later playing her own daughter. edward arnold is as always great (pleeez, release ""diamond jim brady"" on dvd!), and walter brennan won one of his 3 oscars in a memorable supporting turn, tho the young joel mccrea (usually a favorite) comes off as a stiff here. yet the inherent problem in any ferber adaptation (see ""giant"", ""show boat"", ""saratoga trunk"", &c.) is theres just too much that needs to be left out. still tho, its fun."
3,Was it edited from original 1936 release?,"I had seen the original movie back in the late 1940's or early 1950's and have always had a scene in my head where at least one (maybe several) steam locomotives were on the tracks and moving in front of the depot building in Iron Ridge, Wisconsin. My parents lived only a few miles from it. I knew the area well!!!I was disappointed that there are no such scenes in this DVD version?Did I imagine the whole thing or was this version edited from the original movie?If anyone can answer my questions, please contact me. ironman2002@charter.net"
3,Come And Get It...why?,"I think it is phenomenal when actors play dual roles. Hayley did it. George Hamilton did it. And then I watched ""Come and Get It"" and witnessed Frances Farmer do it. Ah, sorry, but the first female character, a dance hall girl built like a linebacker and more masculine than any of the other male actors on the screen led me to one question, ""who would want to marry this?"" Sorry, but it ruined the movie for me. I liked the story and I liked the second female character she portrayed, but the dance hall man, ah, girl, was just not believable. She looked like a drag queen with really bad teeth. Walter Brennan was great. He deserved the Oscar. As I said, it's a good story, but why did the director let Frances do that awful dance hall girl? I guess he was into macho girls."
5,Care providers need to see this book,"Care providers in Early Childhood and Developmental Delay need to see this book, for their own professional good. The author is an incredibly perceptive parent. He vividly draws the story of his son's experiences in the hands of a range of professionals. In doing so, Hughes shines a hard light on what appear to be the worst and best possible practices in today's arena. His descriptions elicit gasps -- of consternation or admiration -- page after page. Heart-rending frankness here is lightened by a saving sense of humor. As a fellow parent of a special-needs child, I am left in awe."
5,"An amazing story of grace, dignity and love of family","Robert Hughes has expertly depicted the challenges, the heartache and, yes, even sometimes the humor, of life with an autistic child. More than just a book, Running With Walker is a beautiful conversation with the author, and invites the reader to instantly grasp images from the Huges family household in Chicago, and to fall in love with a family who has maintained its grace, dignity and wit in the face of unimaginable obstacles.A moving, first-hand account written through the eyes of a father with unconditional love, Running With Walker is an absolutely amazing journey."
5,Also great,"I just bought volumes 1-5 of the Kitsune Maison series, and they're all awesome!! The AmazonMP3 price is great right now. I can't wait for volume 6 to come out.(No, I'm not working for whoever produced these albums ... I just love great music at low prices :-P)."
4,Sharp characterization makes the hunt interesting,Quick wit and more in depth look at regular characters make this a fun read. Brightwell writes to a formula but it is an enjoyable one.
5,You can't help but succeed with this book,"This is a well-written, beautiful little book written in peaceful yet eloquent language. Having had little success with meditation, I have been very excited about the consciousness states I have been able to achieve using the experiental CD included with the book. I also find that in addition to being relaxing and instructive (and incredibly entertaining), the shamanic state is indeed a real point of power. I have had almost instant ""life feedback"" or ""results"" - to use an informercial term - after visiting and learning in my own garden space. Read this book, and use the CD. It may prove to be invaluable for you as it has for me."
4,Journey to the Sacred Garden,This is a great book and cd for a practical application in the direction of mediation and shamanism. It is more than an explanation of things and more of an experiential event. I recommend this book and the one that follows it for those who are looking to do work and have not yet found a group or teacher to help them with the real work.
5,a great meditation tool,Very different from Dr. Wesselman's first three books about Nainoa; this is a great meditation tool.
5,A Real Beauty,This belt is a real beauty. I have owned it now over a year and have worn it almost every day. It shows virtually no sign of use.
1,Junk,I have had 3 of these and the plastic swivel clipsnapped on all three. I would stay away from this piece ofjunk.
2,They look nice at first,I've had these a couple years now and they're rusting. I only use a soft cloth to clean these and they are still marred and rusting in places.
5,"Love, love LOVE it.","I actually bought this to use as a sugar bowl, since I couldn't find anything I liked that matched my kitchen style. It works great, looks great and I need to buy another for my cotton swabs in my bathroom! If I could make it airtight I'd buy 6 more! I love the style and look of it. Plus the quality is great. It seems dual walled, sort of like a mini- ice bucket."
5,Vintage Wedding Cake Toppers,"What a great book! This field of collecting has ceertainly been neglected, and thanks to Ms. Henderson, it has now been brought to my attention, I found the photos of the Victorian toppers captivating, as I had never seen any qute like that before, Now I will scour antique malls looking for cake toppers to go with my own wedding cake topper from the 70's. I hope this book hasn't started me on another collection, but that is a possibility!"
3,Bettys Mats,"Bought the Betty BooP floor mats for my P.T. Cruiser and was kind of worried that they wouldnt fit, P.T.S are pretty small in the front seat.But they fit perfect. They look really great with Bettys beautiful face. They are made good and dont slide down. They make my car look really cool. I would definitely buy it again when I need new ones.A BETTY BOOP FAN"
5,A truly special book written by a visionary teacher,"I felt drawn to the beautiful Tarot of the Spirit deck first, and when I read the book, I found it to be equally wonderful. Written by a visionary teacher for her mother's tarot deck, Tarot of the Spirit is simply and beautifully written, and succeeds in conveying (even to novices) deeper and deeper layers of knowledge that may be obtained from qabalistic decks. Eakins leads us to see our potential in its highest form."
5,If I can recommend it more vigorously let me know how and i will.,My Favorite Tarot deck. My only one. I find it always helpful and DEEP. You don't have to believe in anything to use this deck. It deals with the archetypes that dwell in all humans according to Jung and others. It follows many spiritual paths and is very positive even while seeing the dark side of humanity. If I can recommend it more vigorously let me know how and i will.
5,Intriguing,"I have always felt I have some pretty good intuition, and have wanted to explore it, this book has been really interesting, and having fun reading."
3,Really not a bad buy,"I purchased this set and am really pleased with the overall value. The pattern was somewhat lacking in appeal but for the price you have a quality set of dishes covered by the manufacturer warranty. If you have problems with your dishes contact them, they are very helpful."
3,These are Seconds,"Wendy writes that the plates warped after rinsing; they didn't warp, these dishes are seconds. Pfaltzgraff sells these through Amazon at such a great price because they are rejects. They're not bad enough that you would notice when unpacking, washing, setting the table or using them. They sit flat because the bottoms are at least that. But you will notice the warped or bowed shapes when they are stacked in your cupboard. The trim applique on the bowls were not perfectly applied, etc. They are still sturdy, solid dishes but I would have preferred to know that I was buying seconds."
2,Utensils leave marks,"We bought our Orleans pattern through a department store and even bought extra pieces through a speciality store. All of the white areas mark from silverware. We described the problem at the Pfaltzgraff specialty store and we were informed that our silverware must have been a ""lower quality"" stainless. Well, even our ""high"" quality Oneida Stainless marks the plates, bowls. The plates are high maintenance and have to be cleaned after every meal with the Pfaltzgraff stoneware cleaner.Pfaltzgraff must know that they have a problem. You can buy the cleaner in a quart size! Must be something wrong with the glaze. Time to buy new plates. They won't be Phaltzgraff."
2,Not Pfaltzgraff Quality,"I recently purchased this set and upon receiving the plates was disappointed with the quality of the stoneware. On several of the plates there were pits in the stoneware and marks on the design itself. I bought these because of the low cost Amazon offered plus the free goblets but, I also wonder as stated by another reviewer if these are seconds? Just not up to the same quality as the other plates I have bought elsewhere."
3,Thick plates!,"I was surprised how thick this dinnerware is. I like the pattern, but was really expecting something thinner like Corelle. This is probably what many people are looking for, but in my small apartment cupboards, bigger isn't' better!"
4,Too soon to tell,"Haven't read it yet, but it came to my house within two days after ordering by regular mail and I used my Discover Bonus Money to pay for it."
1,boring and moves at a slow pace....,Emily Climbs is a book for people of no imagination or life. Ittook me forever to read because of the lack of action and adventure.I don't reccomend this book to anyone with an imagination. END
5,The best book I've EVER read!!,"this was the best, most beautifully written, most real and imaginative book i have read! Montgomery is a genius and adds real life and also maximum imagination! It was even better than the first one and I couldn't put either down untill I finished it! Read it! You'll love it!!"
1,embarrassing-disappointed,"Order based on positive reviews, and comparisons, purchased to replace old cumbersome stack system, and speakers. However, received sub-standard product. Openned and followed easy install instructions, and had planned to use as background music for same evening dinner party. Excellent sound quality as advertised, however 4 cuts into CD everything unravelled, CD distorted, and skipped. Maybe defective CD? tried new/multiply CD's, same result every time. Followed trouble shooting instructions to remove batteries, and unplug unit, complied with instructions muliple times over three day period (also, needless to say, no music for dinner party evening). Lost confidence in item, did not want to chance same result on relacement, returned for refund, and purchased Boston Acoustic CD unit. BA Plays perfectly with great sound quality, and looks good."
3,VERY strong chemical odor,"This works decently as a litter deodorizer--not remarkably better than anything else I've tried, but it does mask poopy smells. However, I did not expect such as awful, chemical scent from an Arm & Hammer product. Do not order if you are chemically sensitive! I think I'm going to stick with plain old baking soda."
2,Arm & Hammer cat litter,"Product is OK, Seems to make the odors go away right after spreading the product. Although within minutes the power of product is gone. Also should have check the size of the item. This was a small box and I could have gotten twice the size for same price at store. Will not buy online again..."
2,"cheap perfume smell, better to use straight baking soda","this deodorizer works well, but has a horrible cheap perfume smell that is a bit overwhelming (although not as strong as their litter sand perfume). If you like strong perfume smells then you may like this product, but I hate it. sprinkling some standard baking soda works just as well without making your whole house smelling like cheap perfume, not to mention it's cheaper to buy regular baking soda at a grocery store."
1,Would not recommend,"My cat absolutely hates this stuff. After one use, he sneezed for hours and refused to use his litter box until I dumped the whole thing out. The smell of this stuff is more nauseating than regular cat droppings and it clung to my cat for days."
4,Worth it,"I didn't get this a Amazon, but at the local store, but it was worth it. I decided a review here would have helped me decide, so I am reviewing it anyway. If you are making patch cables, you need one of these. I paid $39 for mine, and solved all my problems in one evening. I had a couple bad patch cables, and this sorted it out. I do have one issue: I don't know how to get the battery replaced. There is no obvious place to open the transmitter side. Thus the 4 stars."
2,Pass the Bear Claws and the Office Lottery,"You have to give her credit. Corinne Maier takes a witty idea that could be articulated in under fifty words, and stretches it out into a full book. Perhaps this is part of the joke within a joke.Maier convincingly writes that since the wage earner is the modern day slave, since work is not a place for fulfillment, and since what you do is utterly pointless, the most adaptive thing to be done to remain sane is to maintain the status quo: remain invisible, never take a position of responsibility, and become a parasite. After all, we are managed by "" Homo economicus cretinus"", so who will ever find out?This would be a great little gift book for an executive who takes themselves way, way, too seriously. Then again, they probably wouldn't understand it. Better to circulate your copy amongst your fellow oppressed worker bees and giggle over your fourth coffee break of the day."
1,Read Dilbert Instead,"""Lost in translation"" comes to mind after having read this book. While many of the underlying themes ring true, the text comes across so flat to the point that the book was a chore to read. The Dilbert books convey many of the same points more humorously."
5,This is a great book.,"I like this book. It is about a boy-young man who used to be a Plains Indian but ran away to have many adventures, including funny ones, humilliating ones, and just plain tense, scary ones. I think you should read this book because it is just plain good."
2,Not Worth the Price,".Croton Men's Two-Tone Black Dial Watch #CC311096BSMPI recently purchased this watch at Amazon after reading the reviews. I opened the box and saw what looked like an attractive watch. When I removed it from the box I saw a very thick watch with a RUBBER strap and metal buckel. It looked cheap to me and I just boxed it back up and got an RMA from Amazon and sent it back. I could hardly believe this was a 500 dollar watch. I prefer the LEATHER strap on my Timex Data Link System watch. I was hoping to get a distinctive swiss watch but, except for the all stainless case it failed to live up to my expectations"
1,"Great look, but bad quality!","This watch looks great, i love it, but unfortunately it is a bad watch. I had purchase this watch 2 times in amazon. They both such. The first one's bracelet broke in 2 parts and I took a shower as normal people do am the water when inside the watch. It's suppose to be water resistant, but is not.The second watch lasted a little longer, because i was taking better care of it. However, one day I jumped to a pool with my watch on and once again my watch got ruined.This is a good watch to go to the office and that's that. If it rains from the office to you house, you better put it in a plastic bag, otherwise you lost your bucks.O did not give it a one star because I don't have the option and because i still like the look of this watch. Hope one day they make it better."
3,L'ALBUM N'EST PAS TERRIBLE,"Moi, j'suis des USA et j'étais étudiant d'échange en France l'année dernière. C'était en ce temps là où j'ai eu l'occassion d'éxperiencer la musique d'Alliance Ethnik. Je les ai vus en concert à Lyon et c'était superbe! Je respecte bien leurs efforts artistiques de mler le style américain. Je préfère quand mme les chansons suivantes: NO LIMITS, L'ENFANT DOIT VIVRE, 5H00 DU MATIN ET FAT COMEBACK. En fin, l'album me suffit car aux USA, il est difficile de trouver de la bonne musique francophone! Bon, allez, j'y vais: Ciao!"
3,Creaky Romance based loosely on life of Michael Collins,"Both Oberon and Aherne were big stars in their day and both were pretty much at the top of their game in this film. However, while the story is based loosely on the exploits of Irish rebel leader Michael Collins and his part in the negotiations for a treaty of independence from Britain, the central theme--i.e., the widely believed romance between Collins and Lady Hazel Lavery, a figure in English high society, has been twisted pretty much beyond recognition. Although the story and the movie feel very creaky at this point, at the time the film came out, it was probably considered rather daring since Collins had not been dead that long and the reputed relationship with Lavery was a hot button item, especially since Collins was at the time recently engaged to an Irish woman. For viewers interested in a fuller knowledge of the underlying story, I recommend a book titled ""Hazel"" by Sinead McCoole."
3,Beloved Enemy,"Beloved Enemy is a fictional story based on when Britian occupied Ireland. It's supposed to be about the Irishresistance.Basic storyline:The British are trying to put an end to the resistance, andthere is a particular Irish leader who they are trying to catchand they don't even what he looks like. A British official comes, bringing his daughter with him. His daughter meets an Irish man who she falls in love with, but finds out he is the resistance leader her people are seeking to arrest. Their differences make it hard for them as she is closely watched. The two countries seek for peace and...well, that's the basic story.It's supposed to be about the resistance but I think it's mainly just a romance story."
5,Incredible Harmonies/Spirited&Energizing/Meaningful Lyrics!!,"This collection of ""Spin Art"" is one that would appeal to many audiences. The variety of the collection reaches out to many tastes. The vocals alone could capture even the most skeptical critic. I feel the songs have great meaning, some beautiful melodies, as well as high energy tunes that truly motivate any listener, into becoming part of the music. (Singing, dancing, etc...) Venice is often compared (and fairly so), to Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, but I find them to have a flavor that's truly their very own. The talents of these individuals are widspread, but they have created and chosen to play music that is most natural to them, which predominantly centers around their harmonies. Venice, as well as ""Spin Art"" are a must hear at least once. I would bet that 9 out of 10 new listeners, would take an immediate liking to the band. ""Spin Art"" is an outstanding collection!"
5,"Great band -- CD is great, but the songs are better live","I just saw Venice at the ""House of Blues"" (in Downtown Disney, California, which I like to refer to as the ""Mouse of Blues"", sorry) and they were excellent. I got this CD and although I really like it, I miss some of the dynamics and power from their live show. The CD has softer ballads and is more acoustic. It's definitely worth having, but I'd rather have the live versions given the choice."
3,"Adorable photos and humor, not substance","The first half of the book is adorable and the different wraps are well illustrated and explained. They are basically the same wrap many ways. I would NOT recommend this book as anything but a fun little gift with some useful info.The author gives sling directions that do not work with the length of fabric given and the directions she writes! I defy anyone to use an unaltered length of 4- 6 feet of fabric and criss-cross it around your body to make the slings shown. Even with 12 feet of fabric, I had a hard time getting the thing tied and the baby put in there. If you are into baby-wearing and want a nice gift for your preggo friends, I suggest a Moby Wrap rather than this book!"
1,Total waste of money,"Omg. Please, please don't try to carry your baby using any of the instructions in this book; not only are the carrying positions uncomfortable, some of them look downright dangerous for the baby. As a seasoned babywearer I was excitied to come across a ""mainstream"" book about babywearing, too bad the book doesn't deliver. The yardage instructions are incorrect and none of the carrying positions are ergonomically sound or secure. If you want to learn to wrap your baby go to the babywearer.com for real information. Skip this travesty of a book."
2,Not what I expected,"Cute pictures and good graphics but not so illustrative or educational as expected, to the point of repeating several ways to wrap the baby but with a different type of fabric."
4,Best baby shower gift.,"I love to give this book to my friends when they are expecting. The lost art of swaddling has proven effective for the mothers of many crying babies. Plus, the pictures are fun! Who would have thought of swaddling your baby in a grocery sack after an accident? Bring back the old school!"
2,Discouraging for potential babywearers,"I was so excited to see this book on the shelf my 3 favorite things babies, origami, and wrapping. Inside there was an even bigger passion BABYWEARING! I was sorely dissapointed to see that out of the few babywearing options many of them look extremely uncomfortable for adult and baby (I say this as a seasoned babywearer) and put baby's spine and hips in the undesireable position and need someone else to put the baby in for the wearer. I have never used a carrier that required 2 adults. There are oodles of more practical, comfortable, and convienient babywearing positions out there and this book had none of them. If I was new to babywearing one look at this book and I would say ""Hmmm...no, not for me."" and go waste my money on a big clunky stroller."
1,Do NOT learn how to wear your baby from this book!,"I am simply appalled at the babywearing section of this book! The wraps are all shown (besides the hip carry) with the babies facing outward and ALL are very poorly positioned as well. Several pictures look as though the baby could fall out at any minute! These carries would be uncomfortable in the best case scenario, and downright dangerous in the worst. Babywearing can be a safe, comfortable, and enriching experience for both caregiver and baby, but this book just does not qualify to teach even the basics of how to wear your baby safely."
2,poor babywearing section,"Yardages are completely wrong for babywearing. I wasted $$ buying a pieced of fabric that was too short to make the wrap described in the book. I had to rebuy...so instead of of a DIY less expensive wrap, I might as well have bought a commercial one. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT"
1,Never received item.,"My credit card was charged. I wrote emails requesting item but never recieved it.Like stealing.I would like resolution.....like a refund.I would never buy from this seller again.Again, never received item."
2,"Decent, but could be difficult to clean","Would not buy again, but only because I know now what to look for and not that I am entirely disappointed in the product.The curved handle has a significant gap that opens into the cylindrical part which can easily be home to random particles of food that, once in, won't be coming out.I wouldn't buy a scraper with sides again. I initially thought it would be good to prevent food from falling off, but then realized it just makes it harder to get food on because the sides reinforce the product and make it so that you can not bend the metal sheet and actually do any quick scraping and scooping."
5,Wouldn't want to be without it!,Love the food scooper. Wouldn't want to be without it! I bought several to give to my children because they threatened to steal mine!
4,A very handy gadget,"Chopped veggies, shredded cheese, minced herbs and pastry dough are just a few uses for this scoop. Clean your cutting board and stop leaving precious little bits of food behind! This is washable by hand, but I just toss mine in the top rack of the dishwasher. I also purchased this on the 4-for-3 promo, which made it a inexpensive addition to my ever grown collection of kitchen tools."
3,Average but Worthwhile,"I enjoyed 'Rebecca' and wanted to try another of the author's books. ""The House on the Strand"" was an average read, but I recommend it to time travel buffs and those who enjoy Du Maurier's style. The book takes place in Cornwall, England in 1969 and the 14th century. I was fascinated by Du Maurier's descriptions of the landscape and surroundings in each century as the main character travelled back and forth. The story line starts out interesting, but frankly not much really happens. There is a lot of intrigue and none of it ever gets wrapped up. I was a bit bogged down by names and roles of many of the 14th century characters, but a family tree in the beginning of the book was very helpful. The story is light, and besides the 14th century names, it is a fast read. I would say it is a good vacation read for someone going to Cornwall, or a reader who just enjoys a little old fashioned time travel."
3,A little flat,"Du Maurier's ""Rebecca"" and ""The Scapegoat"" are both among my all-time favorites, and after reading the reviews here, I was looking forward to ""House on the Strand."" I've got about 40 pages left, though, and am not a fan of this book.While the story itself is intriguing, I am not hooked -- even on repeat readings of the other two books I mentioned, I couldn't put them down. This one ... it just doesn't pull me in. I think it's because the characters are all rather two-dimensional -- both in the past and present. I didn't really care what happened to any of the people the narrator interacts with; rather, the most interesting thing to me is his growing addiction to this time-travel drug. So in that respect, I liked it -- and that point, along with Du Maurier's writing, is why I gave this as many stars as I did."
3,"Well-conceived and researched, flat characters","Time travel in the company of a boring and fussy Brit twit protagonist is not a journey I'd sign up for again. Al Gore's word ""snippy"" was invented for this guy. The characters he shadows in the 14th century are equally dullish and two dimensional, plus who's betraying whom -- politically and maritally -- pales quickly. I read waiting for the twist (it is a nice ending!) and for the very thoroughly researched details of Cornwall now and six centuries ago. Unfortunately, one feels considerably more interest in the drug, that transporting liquid, than in anything else, not a good sign for a novel of really unrequited love. The final fifty pages fly past but getting to that point is as much of a slog as the time travelers moving through the cold marshes and estuaries of the past."
3,I guess I just didn't get it,"I was disappointed in this book, especially considering the favorable reviews posted here. The concept was intriguing, but the segments in which the narrator went back to the 1300's were incredibly boring. I simply did not care what was going on with those characters. Lord So-and-So was cheating on Lady Whoever, and on whose side was the Monk? It was impossible even to track the relationships. The only thing that kept me reading was the sub-plot set in the narrator's real life. The increasing tension between the narrator and his wife, and his increasing addiction to the time travel drug, were the only interesting aspects. And I found nothing exceptional about the ending or the last paragraph, as some reviewers had found. It was a real let-down. Worth reading? Maybe...but a low priority."
2,Logically illogical,This book is quite boring since the main character kept going back and forth between time zone. No color and drama in this novel. Hard for reader to digest since so many characters were introduced and the 'out of this world' kind of plot is too hard to believe even to the most Science-Fiction -minded readers.
5,Time Travel Masterpiece,"I read this book long ago, so long in fact that I had forgotten the story other than the broad premise. And of course, anyone who reads du Maurier's time travel masterpiece will not forget the ending. That much I did recall. I just finished reading it all these years later and now I know why I loved it the first time. The author's skill in storytelling, capturing the time and place, and rendering both in superb, believable diaglog, is amazing. For me it was one of those truly ""couldn't put it down"" novels. Excellent. Highly recommend."
5,Fascinating Read,"Great story of a modern man experimenting with a special concoction that causes him to shift back in time mentally but he is moving in the modern world. After one episode he finds himself in the moors in the rain after the drug wears off. The end is really interesting. Really an incredible read, and you'll read it more than once!"
2,A dissapointing read,"I loved REBECCA and JAMAICA INN, and even the enigmatic, though uneven, MY COUSIN RACHEL. However, I found HOUSE ON THE STRAND to be unengaging and ponderous. Too thick with description to make a stimulating story, I found it slow and filled with unnecessary detail. Maybe it was better to readers thirty years ago. Out of respect for the author's literary command and prose, I am giving it two stars, but I can tell you it disappointed this reader."
1,Used book,"I don't mind used books, but i was very discouraged to see the coffee or tea stains all over the book and cover. I don't know who is in charge of making sure used books are at least clean, but they need to be given a course in used vs dirty and messy,"
2,"Somewhat interesting, mostly vapid.","This book is another attempt to rationalize faith through an incomplete and non-evident joining of established scientific theory with theology.I will say that the book brought up some interesting hypothetical situations, but it was hard for me to take it seriously as he never offers up evidence tying his theology into the science presented. I feel the book misrepresented itself."
2,"A bizzare synthesis of Bible, Science, and supposition","This is a book which takes some strange approaches to try and use science to prove God. He often uses ineffective dimensional perceptions to try and prove God's nature. Hugh contend that Jesus could do anything in any dimension at any time during his life on the earth. Maybe, but I thought that being limited as a man was part of the purpose.The many graphs in the book attempting to show the rise or fall of a person into salvation or blashpemy are a waste of time. He attempts to reduce spiritual realities to finite lines on a graph. Some of his points may be right but his evidence is flawed and largely empty."
1,baseless apologetics disguised as scientific rationalism,"I was looking forward to reading this book, based upon the strength of the reviews. Unfortunately, after scanning a few chapters, I was absolutely crestfallen. As an apologist and a scientist, I do not appreciate baseless Christian apologetics masquerading as rationalism, whether or not a scientist penned them. Indeed, I found Ross's freewheeling mixture of lobotomized mathematics, misunderstood physics, and elenchic philosophizing to be both superficial and insulting. I should have been forewarned: conspicuously absent from the jacket were any blurbs written by knowledgeable scientists, though religious scholars totally ignorant of science praised the book to the skies. I rated the book ""2"" instead of ""1"" solely because the grammar, style, and typography were excellent."
2,Confuses the physical and spiritual,"If you want to read a book with some interesting interaction between religion and science that is not nonsense, I suggest ""The Bible According to Einstein."" I read it and it is excellent."
1,A dangerous compromise of Biblical Truth and Foolishness,"Ross compromises with the world's philosophy which is built on sand. To Ross, science is not fallible and the Bible is fallible. He will never come out and write that for the fear of what evangelicals might say, however, you will be lulled into believing that. Scripture is not defended by Rossist theory. He answers the fools according to their folly, and finding out that he is just like them. He attempts to build on the sand foundation of humanistic assumptions"
1,Same old rehash from his other books! A Waste of TIME & $!,"Ross just repackages the same old compromised views he has been teaching for years. It is the same compromise, the same twisting of scripture, the same arrogant highbrow attitude. All that to save face with the foolish men of the secular world. It is First Rate Compromise! I'll give it a ""5"" for that!"
5,Great Book,"This is a great thought inducing book. I do not agree with everything pitched, however, he does have some concepts that really are new to christian philosophy and that warrent further study. Chapt 2-3 are pretty tough to get thru if you are not a science geek, but it is worth the read."
3,Disappointing vs Live,"For anyone going to New Orleans, catch Mamou at Patout's on Bourbon Street - they are exciting to watch and incredibly talented. Unfortunately, their album comes up short on both counts. I'm not sure how they could capture their energy on an album, though. The album does provide a pretty good representation of Cajun style music, however, and appears to be their best to date. Maybe a video album would be a better way to go."
3,mixed bag on marxism,"This collection is certainly 'diverse'. There are a number of interesting essays here, a number of mediocre ones, and a number which could fall into the 'relevant' category if they happen to be your thing. Overall a good introduction to the influence of what was then called 'postmodernism' on academic Marxism in the USA. 'Postmodernism' may have worn out its welcome by now but that by no means signifies a victory for complacent 'modernist' Marxists such as Eagleton, but rather might signal the end of Marxism's relevance in academic work and its relegation to political movements in Nepal, Chiapas, etc.The one stand-out essay here is Warren Montag's paper on Louis Althusser's autobiography. Surely essential reading for anyone reading 'The Future lasts Forever'. You can probably photocopy that brief piece from the local library, however."
1,"""Full Metal Jacket"" = terrible","There's a lot to be said about Stanley Kubrick's Vietnam war film ""Full Metal Jacket."" ""Full Metal Jacket"" lacks any kind of form or structure fond in my favorites ""Apocolypse Now,"" ""Casualties of War,"" or ""The Deer Hunter."" ""Full Metal Jacket"" tries to make up for it's flimsy plot with trite attempts at comic relief and poorly, unfunny one-liners. The acting, with the exception of Vincent D'Onofrio and R.Lee Erney, is robotic and even stale. Kubrick is a fantastic director and ""Full Metal Jacket"" does have a few neat shots, but too many times does Kubrick recycle the same camera angle or movement. This was one of those movies that I was looking foward to seeing and then when I finally saw it, I waited two hours for it to get better or go somewhere, and it never did."
3,well it took this one to do it,"Clearly captures the essence of ""its all good fun until some one gets hurt"" then it becomes real. Wkae up call to all who didnt go there."
1,Full Metal Jacket,"Full Metal JacketI was very much unsatisfied with this product for one simple reason. It came in full screen format. I ordered it along with two other DVD titles.Both of the other movies came in wide-screen versions. I only buy movies in wide-screen. Perhaps it was my own fault for not being more specific, but I don't recall having an option. I am aware that I could have returned it. I decided instead to give it away as a Christmas present rather than go through the headache and expense of getting a bubble pack envelope, paying postage, and driving to post office.I have, in the past, made other purchases from Amazon.com that I was completely satisfied with. I don't know that I would ever order another DVD without knowing specifically which format I would receive.As for film itself, I have enjoyed it every time that I have seen it in past. I look forward to picking up a wide-screen version and would recommend the movie to anyone that likes war films.""rude dog"""
5,KUBIRCK APPROVED IT FOR A REASON!,Kubrick was against Stereo because he didn't trust it. He approved this disk because he wanted it mono. He also determined if a movie should be shown wide screen or full screen. This wasn't shot at 2.35:1. It was only 1.66. YOu aren't missing much by having it adjusted for your set. And if it is a great film (which it is) then you arent missing anything.
3,"great movie, bad video transfer","Love the movie, and I believe there are enough reviews on it that I don't need to reprise.But the video is grainy, and the sound is ""canned"" and lacks dynamics. I compared the vid to a few reference Blu-rays that I keep on hand from the same time-period, and this one is sorely lacking.They will probably re-issue it in a year or two with a better transfer. until then, this is better than nothing!!!"
3,Needs to be letterboxed!!!,"Screen trimming really detracts! Its the only DVD option, and I enjoy the movie so much that its better than nothing - but it needs to be seen in the widescreen aspect ratio to be truly appreciated. If you are a fan of the movie, get it. If you are a fan of the genre but maybe not this movie in particular, stick to letterboxed titles!"
5,A Masterpiece,"The day I saw this movie was the day I saw my favorite movie of all time. The movie is broken in 2 parts: the 1st part dealing with boot camp and the 2nd part dealing with vietnam war. During the whole movie you see the main character Joker go through changes.I think the movie comments on a person going through the process of becoming a killing machine. From the start you see them getting their head shaved, then go through boot camp: where get broken down and rebuilt in the image of the marines, then get shipped to the war where they must survive and use what they were taught, and then in end revert back all the way to their childhood when they were just innocent little kids."
5,Great movie,"There is absolutely nothing wrong with the transfer. It is superb and the sound is good also. The detractors of the quality of the dvd are not, in my opinion, correct.The actual movie is a little disjointed but still a classic."
4,"Great movie - powerful, but why no stereo or surround sound?","Kubrick's strongest movie ever made. The DVD is a great extension of the VHS version offering clear video. The sound is also cleaner but why no stereo or surround effects? Seems like absolutely nothing is coming out of the rear channels. If you can't wait, buy it. If you can, hope that a criterion version comes out later."
5,As dissonant as Vietnam?,"Boot camp: organized, disciplined, harsh. Vietnam: Vague, strange, disorienting, incredibly dangerous. Veterans talk about Vietnam this way, starting with how you couldn't find the enemy. This movie brings the dichotomy to life, with incredible performances."
5,A must own,"This is by far one of the better war movies out there. Athough i have heard it can be confusing to the first time viewer it is an absolutly great film. Even though not a comedy, the film has humerous twist."
4,I can watch this on VHS,"The MAIN reason I bought a DVD player in the first place was that most films are released in their original theatrical aspect ratio. This is not the case with Full Metal Jacket, per orders of Kubricik himself. I can understand if the aspect ratio is only 1.33:1 (like Clockwork Orange), but this was released in correct ratio, why not an even ""wider"" widescreen for FMJ?"
3,Great Movie Poor DVD,"Kubrick is a ledgend, he is among the best film directors ever to grace Hollywood and Full Metal Jacket is a Testiment to that. I cannot express just how powerful this film really is, if you haven't seen it yet then my friend you have missed a true gem. I wish i could have given this DVD 5 stars, but to tell you the truth Warner Brothers DVD's stink and this DVD is true to that which is why i am giving it 3 Stars, This film is presented in 4:3 full screen, desipte the box back cover stating the film is in widescreen letterbox format, the transfer is poor and so is the sound equally, you might as well just buy the video. I am very dissapointed with WB they have not put any effort into their DVD's, if Kubrick knew about this he'd roll in his grave."
2,Pan and Scan??? MONO??? what is Warner thinking???,"Kubrick is dead! Bring back the real thing for home theatre enthusiasts! The original master tapes won't last forever you know.Filmed in 1:66, it is slightly wider than 1:44 so you do lose some of the film. While this doesn't make much impact in the Shining, it makes a vast difference in Full Metal Jacket (I have a 72"" front projection so I do get full frame differences). Also releasing the movie in Mono was a serious mistake. It is recorded in Dolby Stereo and should have been kept that way. Kubrick isn't getting royalties anymore from theatrical releases, so release the real thing. It almost makes me want to boycott Warner Movies altogether, and if Fox ever releases their films on DVD, I have no qualms with following through on that threat.Warner, I know you read these, so take these words to heart: DTS sound, Anamorphic widescreen, KEEP CASES!!!Change your ways or lose several dozen customers who buy 5-10 movies/month!"
5,Widescreen speculation,"I can't count the times at work or elsewhere I have heard a group of guys exchanging one-liners from this film. Act I or act II the dialouge itself is tremendous, as is the movie.I had researched the availability of this title on widescreen and have found that the standard version that is available is the theatrical widescreen. On the dvd release you are actually seeing more of the picture than what was shown in the theatrical release. If you want to see it as it was shown in theaters cover the top and bottom two inches of your screen for an approximate 1:85 aspect ratio. These 'bars' were removed for dvd release.There will never be a 'widescreen' release of this film as the standard version is that release. The aspect ratio is 1:33 but this is not a pan and scan."
2,Why 4:3?,"It's disappointing that Warner Brothers *still* has not released this movie in regular DVD format at a widescreen ratio. 5 star movie, minus 3 stars for the format."
3,"decent, but...","I am the largest-scale fan of Kubrick one can fathom.... A Clockwork Orange and 2001 changed my life... but this is just your basic '80's war movie, I don't think it was so good."
4,critique,really bought this movie for my brother who says it is one of his favorite films. my son is a marine so I can't watch these types of movies!!
3,Full Metal Jacket (Blu-Ray),Great move but the transfer to blu-ray DVD wasn't vary good. Most parts of the movie are grainy. I expected a better quality transfer for a landmark movie such as this one. They could have at least remastered the movie but instead it looks like they made a DVD copy with slightly higher resolution. If you have the DVD version of this movie stick with it. It's probably looks the same.
5,Two films in one!,This is one of the best war movies ever. The beginning scenes at the boot camp set the stage for what follows and helps to learn what it took to become a Marine. Kubrick's directing is top notch as usual. After watching this you'll be singing the Mickey Mouse song in your dreams.
3,Great movie -- DVD is missing something,"I was disappointed to discover that all versions of Full Metal Jacket are full screen, especially the Special Collector's Edition. Most DVDs are released as widescreen these days but even in the beginning both formats were often offered. For this reason I can only give this DVD 3 stars. Were I only rating the movie it would get a full 5 stars."
1,Limited Edition Collector's Set Features are a Lie!,"I held off buying the 'normal' edition of FMJ for the very reason that I wanted a widescreen version. The Amazon specifications for the Limited Edition clearly state:""Color, Closed-captioned, Widescreen, Box set""After, pre-ordering, and waiting months and months, I finally received my Limited Edition yesterday. And guess what?It's still NOT WIDESCREEN!I'm highly disappointed that I was mislead on the feature set. If you want a widescreen version of FMJ, don't buy the Limited Edition, despite what the specifications say."
4,Retired Marine,I am A retired Marine (21 yrs) The movie did an outstanding job on the part of Marine Corps bootcamp.Anyone ever wondering what Marine bootcamp or Drill Instuctor's were like need look no further. That being said the part about Vietnam was a little over the top. All in all an excellent movie!
1,could not play,"I can't see anything wrong with this disk but it will not play in my DVD player, computer or PlayStation3. Insert in package says a ""firmware or software update may be required for your DVD player"" but my PS3 is up-to-date with all BluRay and software updates."
3,violent Vietnam epic,"Tries to do too much, schizophrenic in it's story telling, and frankly, I had a hard time identifying with the characters. Nonetheless, it has some good action sequences, with the obligatory anti-war message."
4,"Landmark film, lousy DVD","I would expect more from the official ""Stanley Kubrick Collection"" but since he's one of the most overated directors of all time I really shouldn't be disappointed.No widescreen...shame shame. I suppose I should be grateful for the 5.1 audio, which is quite good actually, but have to deduct more points for NO extras whatsoever. Well, unless you call a trailer an extra then there is ""one"" extra.BTW, there is [are] claims Kubrick ""shot"" this film in 4:3. [They] must have been from the same planet Stanley was from cause the theatrical release was in 1:85. DUH!"
1,DISGUSTING MOVIE!,I SERVED IN THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES. THIS MOVIE IS GARBAGE. IT IS FILLED WITH DISGUSTING PERVERTED SEXUAL JOKES. THERE IS NO COMBAT UNTIL 1 HOUR AND 15 MINUTES INTO THE MOVIE. THE COMBAT SCENES ARE EXCELLENT. BUT AS A WHOLE. THE MOVIE STINKS.
1,Waste of time,"Ugh i was so mad! I thought it was going to be a good funny yet serious movie, but it was horrible. First when i was watching it i thought it was about the fat guy then all the sudden its about the journalist, what the heck i didnt follow that story. It should have just ended right when boot camp was over."
2,Weird movie,"Not too bad at the beginning, but you expect it to build to something more than it does. Kind of a let down with the ending."
2,The Badtimers,"Compare Stanley Kubrick's early masterpiece ""Paths of Glory"" with the turgid and vacant ""Full Metal Jacket"" and you have a pretty clear picture of the magnitude of the director's decline after ""2001."" Apart from some of the worst acting he ever directed, the film is rife with the neurotic obsessions that overcame Kubrick in middle age. He would not, for instance, cross so much a body of water as the English Channel to film at more convenient locations in Spain, but instead inflated his budget by having his idea of Vietnam built on English stages. In the end he was so discouraged by the final product he didn't make another film for 12 years. Anybody wanting a clear idea of what the Vietnam War was all about is going to have to look elsewhere; and if you want to see why Kubrick was once thought to be the best American director of his generation, check any of his films from 1968 backward."
2,Not A Cohesive Narrative. The Best Bit Is The First Half.,"I saw this crappy movie just out of curiosity about Vincent D'Onofrio aka Goren in his early days. It's not even worth one viewing. The best part of the movie is the first half, parts of which (I think) are viewable online; and R. Lee Ermey (a real-life soldier in the army) is hilarious as Sergeant Hartmann. I really dislike this movie because it's not a cohesive narrative. There's not one character (except maybe Gomer Pyle) that you can really care about, but even Pyle doesn't get enough screen time. It's just as if there are two parts of an idea assembled in a hurry, and the result is a huge mess. To quote a blurb describing another movie, ""Scattershot narrative."" Worth only one viewing. Not as bad as ""Scarface"" (1982), but almost. Rated R."
2,A travesty!,"It really makes me angry that this DVD is not in letterbox format. It's just the standard tv size. Which really really is a shame. This really is a great movie too, the standard tv size just doesn't do it justice at all. These Kubrick collection DVDs seem like they were just slapped together with no real thought. Maybe someday this will be available in the far superior letterbox format. Until then, go to your local Blockbuster and rent the VHS version.there is no excuse for this."
3,HD DVD is a new format.,"This isn't actually a review of the movie, this is just a response to another person's review. He was having problems with the disc, but it is not the disc's fault, nor is it an overuse of copyrigt protection. This is an HD-DVD, a completely new format put out by Toshiba to compete with Sony's Blu-Ray. It uses a completely different laser, code, and encryption than original DVDs. It WILL NOT work in current DVD players, you must purchase a new player that can read these discs. An expansion for the XBox 360 will be put out later so that it will read HD DVDs, but that will not be released until later. As with the Blu-Ray technology, the players will probably pretty expensive, so if you want to watch this on an HD DVD, be prepared to fork over some big bucks."
4,Dehumanisation,"""Full Metal Jacket"" is a very effective movie about the training and war in Vietnam. Following the character Private Joker, the movie takes in the training of new recruits and their experiences in Vietnam.The movie itself really is an illustration of the dehumanising effects of war and the training. Gunnery Sergeant Hartmann particularly illustrates this in his treatment of Private Pyle, (and, yes, Hartman has a lot of fun with Pyle's name). The dehumanising theme is continued in the Vietnam part of the movie, with the soldier's views on the locals being very much as objects. The movie does not simplify it, but looks at the complexities of the moral choices that face the soldiers in the movie.Overall, the movie is a powerful look into the realities of war's effects on people. It is a hard movie to really ""enjoy"", but it is a very good film all the same. I have seen it a few times, and it has stuck in my memory for the way it addresses a very complicated and broad topic."
4,Good movie with a superb first half,"As with Apocalypse Now, whose journey upriver is far superior to the meandering scenes in Kurtz's compound, and the first half of Silence of the Lambs whose brisk investigation is so much better than the long scenes in the basement with Bill, Full Metal Jacket opens brilliantly then levels off. Like these other films, though, the decline is not precipitous enough to ruin the movie. Rather, the great first half carries the rest. An imperfect, but really fine film."
5,Great Price,The movie came fast and was really inexpensive!! It was a movie my daughter ask for and couldn't find in any store!
5,Full Metal Jacket,I always love watching this movie. I can't believe it took so long to get it for my DVD collection.
3,Nothing Special Here,"Not one of Kubrick's best; just lots of shooting and swearing. This film is way too overrated to be called the best war film of all time. However, it does do a pretty good job on depicting what it was like to live under a drill sergeant and the feeing of killing the enemies. However, this film is not historically accurate enough and too violent. It was obvious from this that when Kubrick had reached the end of his directing career, he didn't care about what the books said, and just wanted to get some viewers, knowing much youth likes violence and would pay for that. I never had a taste for his war pictures. Mr. Kubrick should have stayed with making spoofs (like Dr. Strangelove), science fiction epics (like 2001), or even films from classic authors such as William Thakaray Makepeace (like Barry Lyndon)."
1,Good Movie but a Stinker of a DVD,"I enjoyed this movie, but the DVD was a rush release if I ever saw one. No widescreen and only the center channel is used for sound. What a rip-off. I recommend you rent this before you buy."
4,Full metal jacket,"Awesom, second fav next to saving private Ryan and then platoon. Love the soundtrack as well. Pic quality of the Bluray is real clean as well."
2,Faulty DVD Quality,The scene where Gomer Pyle kills the DI and then himself was so broken up that I could not follow it and had to skip to the opening scene in Vietnam. The rest of the movie was fine.
4,"""ministers of death""","In 2003 the US military budget exceeded the military spending of all other countries combined. For some this is a cause to glorify war, so a film that reminds us of the obscenity, vulgarity and human carnage of battle is a good bet. Writer and producer Stanley Kubrick follows a group of Marines from basic training on Paris Island to bombed out buildings with snipers in Vietnam (filmed on sets in England). The sadistic drill sergeant has an amazing gift for obscenity as he trains these his ""ministers of death."""
4,45 Minutes of Nuclear Dynamite!!,"Stanley Kubrick has always had a fascination of the military (i.e., Dr. Strangelove, Paths of Glory). And in this movie he shows us what life is like in the US Marine Corps Boot Camp. Real life drill instructor turned actor, R. Lee Ermey gives a tour de force performance and turns the first 45 minutes of this movie into a Nuclear Hurricane!! Once the movie leaves boot camp, I felt it loses steam. But the direction of Kubrick is enough to leave you focused. Well Recommended!!"
2,"Kubrick Had His Duds, Too","...and this is one of them. People wouldn't defend this film so zealously if it had been made by someone other than Kubrick, but his cult of enigmatic personality drives many to believe that he could do no wrong. You'll see a similar blind loyalty to Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut.""This is NOT ""one of the best war movies of all time""...that's silly. It doesn't even approach ""Patton"" in terms of character, nor does it rival ""Tora Tora Tora"" in scope. ""The Deer Hunter"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" are both superior psychological dramas, and ""Saving Private Ryan"" does a better job of portraying the simultaneous heroism/obscenity of battle. What you do get with ""Full Metal Jacket"" that you don't get with those other films is Kubrick's trademark pessimism about human beings, which is neither insightful nor particularly interesting. But then most people these days think that good art expresses only one thing--nihilism. At his worst, Kubrick fed that mistaken belief."
3,I am confused...,OK... Now I am totally confused! The main reason I held off buying FMJ when it first came out on DVD was because it was full frame. I refuse to buy full frame DVD's and was waiting for FMJ to come out in widescreen format. It appears from some of those posting reviews here that the Blu Ray version of FMJ is NOT widescreen but some format that cuts out a portion of the frame??? Can someone who is absolutely sure they know what they are talking about please clear this up for me (and I am sure many others as well)?
5,Great depiction of boot camp.,"Having gone through Marine Corps boot camp, I'd have to say this movie pretty accurately covers the emotional shock of the whole experience. It's actually a a cult classic amongst Marines because it reminds us of the ""hell"" of our indoctrination to the Corps. That indoctrination in turn has made the Marine community an extremely cohesive brotherhood that lasts well past our time in the Corps. In fact, would any other Marines agree that this was actually a pretty light depiction of the mental stimulation that is boot camp?On a side note. If you think that Lee Ermey was funny in his dark and nasty quips at the recruits, think of 3 drill instructors doing it at the same time. It's like the most hilarious comedy routine that you have ever seen with a dark twist; you laugh--you lose. Hilarity ensues."
5,Widescreen???,"This film was not originally a widescreen movie. Most Stanley Kubrick movies are not widescreen including his last movie EYES WIDE SHUT.So, stop complaining and get this DVD if you like the movie."
5,war is hell,This is one of my all time faves. I loved the war scenes and had to follow this flick because it is gripping.
4,Fantastic one-liners! A ton of memorable qoutes!,"This is one of that all-time best movies! I list this movie in my top 20 movies of all time. The only part of the movie that lags is the last 20 or so minutes. Overall it is a ""buyer."""
4,one of the best war movies ever!!!,"This is a great war movie. I am a great fan of Stanley Kubrick, and this is one of his best. The beginning starts off in bootcamp and is pretty up-lifting. But becomes haunting and tragic. The second half is about the Vietnam War (which is not as entertaining as the first half). If you are a Kubrick fan, rent this, I guarantee you will enjoy!"
3,Full Frame???,"What on earth?? I bought the Stanley Kubrick Collection and this movie (one of my all-time favorites) and the Shining are Standard Format! What's up with that? The rest of the films are widescreen, but these two are not. You've been warned!"
1,Wide Screen Less,One of the best movies of it's kind. One problem.......the 1:85 aspect ratio has been ignored. Why?? We'll probably never get to know...which is frustrating. Presumably when we all get wide screen tv's they re-release the bloody things again......... Warners....you have goofed. Again.
1,Widescreen is cropped version of Full Screen version,"I bought the Blu-ray version of Full Metal Jacket thinking this would be a true widescreen version, but it's not. The movie is actually a cropped version of the Full Screen version. After comparing the two versions, the Blu-ray version seems cramped and lacks the visual composition of the original Full Screen version.This rating has nothing to do with the quality of the story or the audio, which is excellent.The rating has everything to do with releasing this movie as a Widescreen version of the movie. If you want to see what you are missing, buy the original DVD version instead."
1,Get the Deluxe Edition,"This has gone down as one of the WORST blu ray transfers to date. The Deluxe Edition is still not on par with the PQ of the Shining or 2001, but it looks HD. This version is a joke. You might as well watch the standard DVD."
1,The low rating is not for the movie itself...,"...Since I think it's one of the most powerful war movies ever made. I saw it in the theatre when I was 8, and the boot camp sequence stuck with me. The reason I'm giving this 1 star is, why is there no release of the Deluxe edition on standard DVD? Is there some research that suggests that people don't buy standard DVDs any more? I spent hundreds of dollars replacing my VHS collection with DVDs- I'm not about to do the same thing with HD-DVD. Warner Bros, you owe your customers more than this.*Update, 3/4/08- With the recent developments in the market (Sony going with Blu-Ray and Toshiba saying they will stop making HD-DVDs), this particular product is even more irrelevant than when I first wrote the review."
2,Not bad,First time I watch this movie was with my husband. It was ok. I wasn't that into it. I just finished watching it and this time it was better. Very interesting...
2,Don't believe the hype; subpar movie about Vietnam,"I saw this movie in the theatre years ago and could not believe all the hype about it back then, and neither should you now if you are considering buying this DVD. What blew it for me in this movie was the awful acting. In the battle scenes it seemed to me like the ""soldiers"" had just come out of their air-conditioned trailers. They acted very punky. They did not seem like they were on the front lines at all. Compare those scenes with, really, any scene at all in Platoon, and you'll see what I mean. Besides that, the movie is over-directed. Kubrick sometimes fell prey to his own sensibilities, and his bad sensibilities are all over this movie. It just didn't need to be done. I mean, this movie didn't need to be done. At all. 2 stars."
1,Horrible video quality for an HD DVD!,"Although I enjoyed seeing the training part of this move (my brother recently went through it and became a Marine), the movie does end up feeling un-American and un-Patriotic. But this is not a surprise, since when does Holly Wood create anything positive about the nation that gives it the freedom to create boring unpatriotic movies.The main reason I took time to right this review is to warn everyone that the video quality is truly horrible for an HD DVD. If you like this movie for its story or for some other reason, maybe you should just get the DVD. This HD DVD is definitely not one you would want to show someone if your trying to convince them to upgrade to HD."
5,A great classic to be.,"Awesome, to say the least. Hard core, and Hard Corps. Of course, R. Lee Ermey makes it. But still a good move overall."
5,Full Metal Jacket DVD,Got this in only a few days. Very satisfied with product. Was everything it said it would be. 5 stars.
3,"Cool Movie, Bad DVD","This was one of my favorite movies to come out of the Hollywood Vietnam Movie Period (Platoon, Full Metal Jacket and Hamburger Hill). I was disappointed by the DVD however. First of all the sound was in mono and the picture was Pan and Scan for the most part. I would give the movie 5 stars, but I give the DVD 1 star. So I guess it averages out to 3."
4,Ammending an old review,"Yes I said I was mad because it wasn't in letterbox folks. My error! The truth was brought to my attention, and I apologize. The film was not made to be presented in letterbox format, thus there was no way to release a letterbox dvd.So here is my final review. This movie had great visuals and impact. I find this movie to be entertaining each time I watch it, except for the mass grave speech. (What is with that guys meaningless speech and annoying voice?) I have yet to see a scene that hits as hard as the bootcamp finale.If you miss the 1980's when Vietnam movies were the top draws you can relive them with this one. I know you may be wondering; is this movie as good as ""Platoon""? The answer is no. But either was ""Forest Gump"", and people loved it!"
3,R. Lee Ermey stole the show!,Sad to say but the 1st half was the only part worth looking at. I thought it was very accurate on its portrayal about Parris Island back in the bad old days.
3,Full Metal Jacket,"The ""acting"" of R. Lee Ermey is not ""acting,"" it's 1000% authentic! He makes the film!!"
1,Why not widescreen?,"Why was Full Metal Jacket not released in widescreen format? If it had been, I would've given it a much higher review."
2,No Widescreen? Whats the point?,I beleive this movie to be one of the best released on the Vietnam war. (Except for one scene including a high voiced annoying superior downtalking to the young journalist above a grave. Talk about an uninspiring speech!) I have to leave the room durring this scene each time i hear that mans voice. My highest criticism is simple though: Why no letterbox? I have DVD mostly because I can see movies the way they were made to be seen. Without letterbox this movie is still going to lack its theatrical power that I remember. I urge the makers to look at releasing this film in the correct format. Without letterbox this movie is not worth purchase. I just assume wait.
1,Best war movie ever BUT DON'T BUY THIS DVD!,"Wait for Warner to wake up and issue a widescreen version. It's hard to believe Warner still gets away with its sleazy practices.With the exception of a few 'special films"" (like Dr. Zhivago), Warner consistently delivers the absolute LEAST they can get away with: A handful of chapter selections, lousy transfer quality, (...), a dearth of extra material (often none at all), and most annoying: full-screen only format (which loses about a third of the picture).I sometimes buy these Warner rip-offs accidentally. (...)"
1,Quite possibly the worst looking DVD ever.,"I bought this DVD, already having owned the VCR tape, thinking that I would get a better quality picture. Boy was I wrong. The quality of this DVD is quite possibly worse than the video tape. The sound is only in 2.0 so you don't get anything new there and the only extra you get is a 30 second trailer. Definately stay away from this one if you have the video tape already, it's not worth the investment."
5,One of the best,"Kubricks Full Metal Jacket deserves it place alongside 'The Deer Hunter', 'Platoon' and 'Apocalypse Now' as the definitive Vietnam war movies.FMJ is split into two distinct halfs, training and battle. This is unusual in a film, as the standard rule when writing a story is to have a beginning, a middle and an end. Obviously there are always exceptions, and in this case it works because the two part story reflects the grim reality of war. In truth if you can't survive the training there probably isn't much hope for you at war.The performances are uniformly excellent. More importantly the ending is really quite shocking. If you have seen Dr Strangelove you will realise that this probably reflected Kubricks own view on war. Watching the film again twenty years later, and baring in mind the problems in Iraq and Afganistan it does make you think.A great film."
3,"Really two movies - One good, one poor","This is essentially two movies: The Parris Island portion & the Vietnam portion. The Parris Island sequences are engrossing and masterfully done. It would have been great if Kubrick could have developed the basic training story line through two hours. With Embrey in his legendary role as the drill sergeant, I don't think any other movie has portrayed basic training better.Unfortunately, the last portion set in Vietnam is just not that good. Kubrick's attempts to make England look like Vietnam is laughable. The combat intensity of films like Platoon & Hamburger Hill don't develop, but just a bunch of soldiers name-calling each other. By the time we get to the sniper at the end, I was just feeling ""who cares?"""
4,"Mixed results, but still pushes the envelope","I originally saw this movie in the theatre and remember the tension I felt during the Viet Nam scenes. The 1st half is an accessible, almost cliche storyline. The rough strict sargent pushes one recruit too far with tragic consequences. The 1st half is saved by the strong acting of Vincet Donofrio who is almost unrecognizable if you seen some of his other work.The 2nd half has strong colors and is almost surreal. It differes from Platoon, which is a realistic portrayal of life in the battlefield. It may not be to everyone's liking but it is certainly imaginative."
4,full....metal...jacket.,"one of my favorite movies kubrick and matthew modaine how better can it get.lol. i suggest this omvie to anyone who likes kubrick, war movies or both for that matter. i also read the book that its based off of ""the short timers"" by gustav hasford it was really good but i still liked the movie better becasue it had vincent d' onfario and and the segarent(its like blasphemy that i cant remeber his name at this moment) but this movie is great, kind of boring at parts but still its deffinalty worth a watch."
2,No Motivation,"Besides this movie being a little unrealistic in the war-front scenes, there is one large problem that I can't get over with this movie, which involves the scene where the fat guy kills the drill seregent. He obviously chose to go into the Marines, which has the toughest boot camp, even though he must know he isn't apt to do so. It's not that it's a bad movie, it just leaves you feeling a bit empty afterwards."
1,"awful, weak","I watched Full Metal Jacket after watching Platoon and Apocalypse Now. All I can think is that Kubrick must have had a low budget to spend half the movie focused on boot camp. How can this movie be voted in the top five or top ten war movies when there are so many other better ones out there? Pearl Harbor, Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan ............... Save your money."
1,Full Metal Jacket,"I should have known better, I do not like Kubrick's movies, I thought Space Odyssey 2001 was incomprehensible and have shied away from his stuff ever since. But being a war movie fan, I weakened and paid the price, a waste of time, looks like most of it was shot on the back lot in England. The name of the movie was good and the graphic on the DVD cover , that's the best I can say about it."
1,Terribly off and hideous,"The content, language, lewdness and disrespect in this heavily anti-war movie surprised me. I regret hearing that it was ever made."
5,One of the greatest movies of all time...,"One of the greatest movies of all time matched with one of the greatest playback formats available. Full Metal Jacket is a rite of passage alongside 'The Godfather' and 'Scarface' that needs to have the best sound and video to go with it so you hear the crispness of every curse and vehement disgust the drill sergeant spews at the fresh meat at Paris Island. It helps that HD DVD allows you to see every bit of spittle that goes with the screaming. Watch this movie, and if possible watch it in with and HD DVD player with a decent surround system with Dolby Digital capability and you will be stunned with it's greatness."
2,Not letterboxed? MONO? Worthless!,"Ever since the DVD format was introduced Full Metal Jacket was one of a handful of movies I have been eagerly waiting to be released. Imagine my disappointment when I put the disk in, pressed play, and saw the ""This film has modified from its original version. It has been formatted to fit your screen."" - disclaimer. And mono? MONO?? I can't believe Warner Bros. even released this. And Kubrick supposedly ""approved"" this edition?"
2,"""Full Metal Jacket:"" Objectionably over rated!","""Full Metal Jacket"" is a very marginal film, if anything. It has been hailed by many as a masterpiece, but I beg to differ. Other than Vincent D'Onofrio's performance as ""Gomer Pyle,"" the film is average, not half as good as other Vietnam classics such as ""Deer Hunter,"" ""Coming Home,"" or ""Platoon."" It has no solid or stable form, it's nothing more than a series of events related to the Vietnam War. It's eposidic and over repeditive at times. Director Stanley Kubrick is capable of creating a masterpiece, ""Full Metal Jacket,"" however, is no masterpiece."
3,Full Metal Jacket (1 disc - blue ray),"This movie has several verions on blue ray. If do not care much about bonus feature, this disc is to buy. Do not expect much and compare its AV qualifty with the latest movie on blue ray disc, but this is a great war movie, like the Platoon, to add into your collection of Vietnam war."
5,Excellent Marine Corps movie,"I love the movie Full Metal Jacket, espically the boot camp part in the beggining, for those who havent seen it, the DI(Gunnery Sgt. Hartman) was a real DI in the Marine Corps. Although some of the war scenes didnt match up to boot camp it was still a great movie all around."
4,FULL METAL BLU-RAY,Just like the original. Just what i expected. this is the one with the better features GET THIS VERSION. the Hi-Def on older movies is a tough thing to get looking and sounding good. they did pretty good with this one.
5,Realistic action and provoking performances.,"A great movie for those of us who want more 'real stuff' on-screen when it comes to war movies. As a combat veteran, I am tired of the usual 'go for glory' dribble fed us by Hollywood and called war films. In real life combat, nice guys get hit and killed on a daily basis. (Some times it may be a squad leader or your best friend, but some-one has to step in and take his place no matter how hard it might be to see some-one you love like a brother fall). This movie shows how and why average young men are trained and sent to do what others do not want to do, in places others do not want to go. This film mirrors, somewhat, my experiences both in training and combat. A 'must see' movie for those who want insight into real life and war."
4,POWERFUL - ENLIGHTENING,"One of the most powerful war movies that I've ever seen, starting with USMC bootcamp and moving right into Vietnam and the savagery of war. Lee Ermey was at his best as the DI, and the lads fighting the war were courageous, united and fuctioned as team. It's unfortunate that snipers know that marines do not leave their comrades wounded in the field, and as a result, a female Vietnamese sniper is able to wound and kill too many of the young warriors. You'll get to meet believeable characters like Joker, Animal Mother, Eightball, Cowboy, and you'll get caught up in the black humor of war, and the nightmare of direct combat. A strong movie - not for the faint-hearted."
5,Great!,"I'd seen this at the movies. I liked it, but, at the time, not as much as ""Platoon"". Remember? There were several Viet Nam movies close together, plus the TV series ""Tour of Duty"". After having aged some, I like ""Full Metal Jacket"" at least as good, but it's different. I ALWAYS liked the first part - BASIC TRAINING. Now I like the second part - THE BATTLE OF HUE - even more than before. This is a great movie, that explores the personalities and relationships of the different Marines more than some other movies. I also like that the fighting is in a developed area (Hue), because a lot of the fighting wasn't in the jungles, and often that's forgotten. This is on par with ""Platoon"" (but different) and way better than ""Hamburger Hill"" which was lame."
5,THIS IS THE BEST WAR MOVIE I HAVE SEEN TO DATE!,"This is one of Kubrick's best films. This is very realistic about the Vietnam War. His best films include The Shining, A Clockwork Orange, and this. Get this classic on DVD."
4,"Best ""Vietnam War "" movie","Full Metal will outsurvive Apocalypse Now as the cinematic treatise to American involvement in Vietnam. Stanley, we miss you, but your work survives, the greatest of all time."
5,The best of the best,Greatest War movie of the 80's. Sgt. Hartman was truly what a D.I. is supposed to be.
5,Huh-Ah,"I would have to say that this is the best movie I have ever seen. Such a classic, to bad Kubrick died before he could do more. A must see."
5,Newley Remastered!,"The Trnasfer is of a very High Quality, The only artifacting problems are with the shiny bullet chains and tha's a minor one at that :)"
3,Good,"This movie tends to inspire a lot of deep philosophizing, since the director, Stanley Kubrick, is considered the second best American director and the subject, Vietnam, is one of angst and introspection. There are a lot of deep things you can take from this. The split between the first and second half is either a brilliant metaphor for the duality of man or an embarassing plot kink that throws off the mood of the film. The first half training scene achieves a visceral level of imagery that is probably likely to endure on a wider level than any deeper philosophical musings, however.Overall however this was an entertaining movie with plenty of drama and action. One problem though is that the sets used in the second half seemed to be rather reptitive. It kind of felt like the platoon was walking through a movie studio and not a burned out town. I have to give it credit for originality, however."
5,The fat kid goes crazy,"This movie takes one of the most brutal aspects of the army and makes it even more brutal. This story starts off with a fat kid that's trying to make it through combat training. The problems he has(mostly because he's fat and not all there) and his resolution to the matter(full metal jacket). Near the middle of the movie, the forward plot direction does a 90 degree turn. From here we follow a reporter in the war. All in all, a fantastic movie with some very disturbing scenes."
3,is this REALLY HD?,"Yes, I was disappointed with this release. Only on occasion does it surpass the standard edition, even with side by side comparisons. The choice to letterbox the presentation, against Kubrick's intentions, does not jibe with the intent of HD, which is to give you the most accurate presentation of the film on a home video medium. Hopefully Warner Home Video will revisit this title again in the future and give it the remastering it should have received."
4,"may be low budget, but worth watching","This movie was rented on a whim and was enjoyed by our whole family (four kids ranging in age from 7 to 13). Yes the actors are unknown and not ""professional"", Yes the effects are not ""hollywood quality"", but if you've ever read or even heard of John Bunyan's classic Pilgrim's Progress this is a great adaptation. If you can get past all the amateur-ness of the movie and really watch and listen for what it is, you'll see a great movie."
3,Watch it.,"Yes, it is low budget, with unknown actors, and a Christian moral based movie. I am watching it now with my two sons as I write this. They are laughing at the ""special effects"" , making fun of the acting, but still enjoying it. As significant plot points occur (like when Chris drops his backpack..aka his burdens..over the cliff and is free to follow God) it becomes a teaching moment on biblical truths and the importance of faith in God. Really quite a surprisingly enjoyable movie. I've been far more bored and disappointed by more expensive movies with A-list actors. Don't listen to Iggy... cough up $1.29 at Redbox for this , you might actually enjoy it!"
1,Terrible!,"This movie was poorly edited, and overall really terrible and boring. The message maybe good, but it isn't worth watching... read the bible instead, that is more fun."
1,"Good topic, poor execution","I am a Christian and was hoping this would be interesting and adventurous, fun for the whole family; instead my family found this very amateurish with a stilted script and frankly it was not worth the time or money."
1,Poor quality,"The intention for a movie to be based on Pilgrims Progress is commendable but unfortunately this is a poor quality film, poor acting, poor script and poor special effects. I wish I could have a good review as I like the concept, but unfortunately I cannot."
1,I would rather eat poop than finish watching this,"I got this at redbox because it had a good cover and my 6 year old son wanted to see a film. It is creepy Christian propaganda, absolute garbage storyline and characters, constant wink wink nudge nudge biblical hints, and the special effects were basically monsters made out of trash bags... This movie tries to pose as a Harry potter style film, but don't be fooled-- it's horrific. There's nothing engaging at all about this. All of the positive reviews were made by cast members and their families and their fellow cultists. Avoid this schlock fest at all costs"
1,Horrible acting and story,"Okay, it is supposed to be a some what post apocalyptic world where they don't even know what books are. The main character, Chris, ran away from home a long time before, yet he has braces! Need I say more?The acting was horrible and the special effects looked like they were done by a five year old. Don't waste your time or money."
1,Low budget Christian propaganda,"Don't waste your money. It's like watching an amateur class project made by a sunday school class. Also sold under the name ""The Wylds."" by the way, I love how they ripped off the Harry Potter type font to trick kids (and adults like me) into renting it.Message = ""There's a war coming! Better read your bible or you'll burn for eternity!!"""
5,A very interesting story with good actors,When I saw that this series had come on DVD I remembered how fascinated I was when it was first shown on TV. I was not disappointed. It still keeps you interested and specially Emma Thompsons performance is wonderful. But in fact the whole cast is excellent.
5,WWII AND THE PROFESSOR,"KENNETH BRANAUGH & EMMA THOMPSON ARE PROFESSOR AND HIS BELOVED BUT OFTEN NEGLECTED WIFE WHO ARE ENDURING THE WAR TOGETHER AND APART WITHOUT MUCH FUSS. THEY HAVE FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTENANCES BOTH OLD AND NEW WHO HAVE THEIR OWN REACTIONS (OR INDIFFERENCE )TO THE WAR. BUT IT ULTIMATELY TOUCHES ALL OF THEM IN THIS INVOLVING 5-HOUR DRAMA. THOUGH IT MOVES ALONG NICELY, DON'T LOOK FOR MUCH ACTION."
4,Very good series,Has become one of my favorite series. A combination of drama and history with compelling characters. Good solid entertainment value. Takes the viewer through five years of war on a personal level.
5,Fortunes of War,"This DVD ""Fortunes of War"" has some of Englands greatist actors staring in this epic picture. Also my very favorite actors, Kenneth Branagh, Emma Thompson, and Rupert Graves. Yes, there are other actors and they all did an excellent job. The story is a sweeping story, starting in Bulgaria and ending up in Cairo, Egypt. This story begins at the on set of World War Two. The story is about a young Englishman and his wife as they run from country to country as the German Army advances. The scenery is very well done. You get to see a way of life that existed before the Germans detroyed the world. This is an excellent film, and deserves all that stars that I can give it. This is a must see movie, well worth buying and adding to your library."
4,great but flawed,"What great news that this has arrived on DVD! A wonderfully atmospheric and beautifully photographed BBC adaptation of of the Olivia Manning ""Balkan"" and ""Levant"" trilogies. And therein lies the only flaw. The second of the trilogies was written decades after the first (which was contemporaneous to the events in that trilogy). As a result, the second half of the mini-series strikes a different (rather idealised, almost mystical) tone compared to the first half, which captures the dramas and foibles of the characters in a more realistic fashion. But having said that, this is a production not to be missed. Branagh, Thompson and especially Ronald Pickup as Prince Yakimov are wonderful. What a treat to see it again!"
4,Magnificent Porduction,"I just finished this series and feel as if there should be more to it. The series was exceptionally well down with spectacular on location production. The actors did a magnificent job, the scenery and music were all noteworthy, but the story line and plot seemed a little slow. I wish that I had gotten more out of it. It just seemed like fate and circumstances had brought a bunch of liberals together without any common purpose. I could not put it all together. The film was intended for a British audience and there must have been something missing. I may have to watch this another time to see if I get the same reaction. It definitely was entertaining and appealing, but lacking a cohesive story line. I am going to watch it again in a few months, as I feel as if I missed something. Overall it was a magnificent production and held my interest through the final episode."
5,A Fantastic Production!,"I absolutely adore ""Fortunes of War"". The story is terrific from start to finish, and the characters are all memorable. It's filled with movie lines to be quoted, which my family does on a regular basis. It's the kind of movie that you can start watching at any point. Any segment is excellent. I recommend this movie to friends all the time."
3,How do you turn on the Subtitles?,"This DVD was hard to work with on my (new) DVD player. Please, someone, how do you turn on the subtitles? I've tried everything I know several times. The box says ""closed captioned"" and I really need that feature to hear properly."
3,Not as good as I'd remembered,"The production seems based on a ""myth"" of English people as always charming as they conduct their gay and straight romantic affairs against a backdrop of somewhat exotic locales. Harriet is charming as she explores her aloneness, Guy is charming as he spouts Marxism and mounts amateur Shakespeare productions, the elderly man who pulls a toy dog on a string is to be taken as charming because he is a _British_ eccentric - - somehow an elderly man of some other origin wouldn't be so charming. I think most buyers of the tapes will not soon return to them..."
1,Disappointing,"I absolutely loved the Balkan Trilogy by Olivia Manning. However, I found the DVD disappointing. The storyline was hard to follow and very slow."
2,Thompson the terrible,"Why do I dislike Emma Thompson so much as an actress? Aha, I know why -- she can't act. She can read lines and make gestures, but never makes me believe for a second that she's who she's pretending to be. She ruins everything she touches. I have to admit I couldn't watch this in its entirety, purely because of her. For those who haven't seen the show, just look at her picture on the box; she looks like a woman wearing a hat that belongs somewhere, anywhere, else. It's like a pimple on cheese. Apart from her, it was OK, but I don't like Branagh either, another actor afflicted with an unhealthy dose of self-consciousness in his acting, which is fatal."
3,nice table but you need to finish it yourself if you want to keep it looking nice,"Nice good looking, sturdy table and easy to put together. My only problem with it is unfinished so I had to put a few coats of polyurethane on it to keep it from being ruined by crayons and markers."
4,A nice set,"We bought this set for out 2 and 1/2 year old son. He loves it. It is a good height and still works for older children who come to visit. It is well made and seems to be holding up very well after 6 months. It is not bad to clean. Our only complaint has nothing to do with quality, but rather that we ordered the natural set and it came with the stools with colored tops."
3,Not nearly as good as his historical fiction,"Cornwell is a great historical fiction writer, but he can't write a contemporary novel worth a darn. The reason for this surprising failing is clear: he needs the structure of a historical event. Without it, his plots simply fall flat. So do his characters. Any one of his historical fiction novels (you pick it) beats his ""Sailing novels"" by a mile."
4,"It looks good, but only ok with functionality.","The armoire looks great, but the doors are a bit crooked, my husband did put it together, but I really don't think it is because of his handywork, his is really good. Also the drawers are really shallow, the back part of the drawer is about half the height of the front of the drawer. There is also no bar or rack to hang clothes on inside the armoire."
3,so so,"difficult instructions but my husband managed. Hardware isn't the best after opening and closing doors. Not necessary but there is not a bar for hanging, just 2 shelves. Would recommend but with warnings. My husband probably would not recommend...."
1,Stork Crap Armoire,"The wood is very lightweight poplar... This is to be expected for such a inexpensive piece. But still, $300 is $300. I would have been okay with things if it were not for the cheap hardware. I had about 3 of the turn and lock mechanisms break on me and had to go the the hardware store to purchase additional screws which will probably do a better job anyhow. Some of the screw actually popped through the finish when tightened with the turn and lock mechanisms.The directions were actually good (if the correct numbers were on every piece - which they were not).Overall I think $100 - $150 is the true worth of this do it yourself Armoire. HAs a nice look... but wouldn't buy again or would use different hardware."
2,can u say made in china,can you find quality product for a good price?..... well not so much w/this piece
2,Anachronistic Disco,"Beware that this disc contains club remixes of First Choice songs by current remixers. The songs are brought into the 21st century; a dubious thing, since the originals still work as dance songs. Also, the collection contains early First Choice, omitting later songs like Doctor Love, Hold Your Horses, and Let No Man Put Asunder."
3,quite good BUT,"Listening section does not contain Audio CD, why are not these excersises on the CDROM?! The attached CDROM has less than 300MB and typical cdrom can contain more than 600MB!!!The Structure section does not contain enough exercises. Some parts are easy for me and I need just 4-5 sentences to see if I understand the problem. Others are more tricky and they contain only 8 examples?! I am taking the test in four weeks, so I will see how much helpful the book was."
3,listening practices,"This is a pretty good book, I would say (although, I can't compare it with other ones). The book has 4 sections for each of the testsections. Each section has tiny steps and explains everything. After each step you take a small test to see if you understood everything. I got bored with all the explanations and examples, so I only did the tests and reviewed the sections, where I had problems.It comes with a CD-Rom, which is very good, because you can practice either the computer test or the written Test. The only problem is the listening section is not on the CD-Rom. You have to buy it extra on CDs (which I couldn't find and actually don't want to spend extra money for). So if you have big troubles understanding spoken English, you'll have to get an extra training book. That is the big minus when buying this product. Everything else is great."
4,It definately help!!,"I've went through this book and worked on all the practice test on the disk, it really helped me to understand the test format in real test condition and provided concentrated review material in different sections. The only drawback will be the tapes included are too clear, which is really different from the real test (it's a bit muffle in the real test) lucky I went through the free toefl practice test material available on the toefl website on the day I took the test and realise that. Anyway, I got 280 points with the help of the book..really satisfy with the result! It's worth to try."
2,Old version,I have found newest edition of the book but it was not. I could not find any information about the book but ISBN it did not allow me to tell it
2,Family Nurse Practitioner Certification Review,"This book in no way replaced the 3 volume set by Health Leadership. The 3 Volume Set by Health Leadership is superior because it contains comprehensive content as well as test questions that follow each chapter. The Health Leadership set covers everything you need to know about major theories, diagnoses, treatment modalities, and nursing interventions. The Health Leadership books are organized in their approach, and improve retention and recall and are a far superior study method for reinforcing your knowledge base. These books also are great to keep as a reference guide in the clinical setting."
4,The essential text for a thorough & systematic board review,"This text essentially replaces the 3-volume Health Leadership Associates series as the primer source for a manageable and thorough FNP review. Strengths include the range of topics, the conciseness of material, questions after each section, and appendices which include among other topics 2 full 175-question exams. Weaknesses are few, and include factually inaccurate information provided as answers to some of the questions (you'll know when you see them but approach the answers with a healthy degree of skepticism). Overall: A must buy."
1,Outdated,"Book is outdated. This would have been nice to know before purchasing. For this reason it does not serve a purpose. However, an overview of management is provided and is somewhat helpful."
5,Always buy authentic toner,"Always buy authentic, new toner and ink for your printers. That is how you will get the most mileage out of them!"
1,Chalky Chew,"I have found wonderful products on-line. This is not one of those times. I would call this chew ""Chalk Flavor"" and not ""Chocolate Flavor"". I was completely disappointed in the taste. I'm not sure if the product actually does what it is supposed to do because I finally threw the bottle out. I tried it 3 different times with the taste getting worse each time. Buyer beware."
3,Healthy Snack,"I will most likely not purchase this item again. The wafers are very powdery and have an odd texture too. Overall, the wafers are a good healthy option to add additional fiber to your diet, but there are better alternatives than to stomach chewing these wafers."
1,Not so good,"I thought these would be so good - they are marketed so well. I really didn't like them (not to say somebody else wouldn't love them - it's a matter of personal taste). The texture was chalky and had a weird chewy feel. I ate 3 of them and threw the rest in the trash. That's how much I didn't like them.The idea of being able to just pop a couple of ""chews"" and get more fiber is a great concept. Too bad they didn't taste good to me."
1,A B**ch on her menstrual,This movie was so horrible it was funny and entertaining!This biohazard she-freak was stolen from the military to some psychotic scientist or whatever. Things went bad when she transformed to this gross thingy (or was on a menstrual with PMS. Of course all of that happened while they were in an airplane. The plane crashed.I don't even want to explain this movie because it was stupid.From the intro of the wet T-shirt competition to the cat fights.This Ice queen whatever had no particular motive. Nor did this movie.
3,It's a Cult Classic and I'm in it!,"This is a cheesy, schlocky, wonderfully campy bad horror flick. I was lucky enough to be in this classic (Uncle Ed). tHe Edgewood crew and Dave G and Neil were great. The rest of the cast were fun. Harmon is the Man. Let's do Ice Queen 2 The Bitch is Back."
4,Hysterical !,"For fans of serious horror flicks, avoid this one.For those who enjoy campy B movies that everyone can crack up and rip on through out the entire film, then this is the one for you!Not recommended for the younger audience as some scenes are questionable.Overall a complete crack-up! A fun game is to try and find all the flubs...you do not have to look very hard to find many, they are all over the place. Enjoy!"
2,Edited versions of the show - they are incomplete.,"if you are a true fan - you will be very dissapointed that a purportedly ""complete"" set contains edited versions of the shows!! A bummer! ( Especially missed the rendition of ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"".) It should be labeled ""Every Edited Episode""!"
5,Thank you Amazon but I would still buy it,"I think it is absolutely wonderful that you can watch The Young Ones on the internet any time you want. With this set now out of print and the prices going up it is great for many that might not want to spend the money on a hard copy. But I will say one thing, if you have the money, buy the set, Every Stoopid Episode is worth every penny.More than a decade later The Young Ones are as good as ever. You will notice different things every time you watch and not only that but there are some great performances by some obscure and not often seen bands. Still worth the out of print prices."
5,Classic Britcom -- but something is missing,"This is a great DVD. Twelve Young Ones episode in one DVD collection. It'll have you laughing for hours. Hint: Try watching The Young Ones with the closed caption subtitles, as British accents can often get kind of heavy, and the viewer misses much of the dialogue.Now for what's missing. Does anyone remember a parody of a spaghetti western called ""A Fistful of Travellers Checks""? The only recollection I have of this episode is Rik in a Black Bart outfit donning a black cowboy hat, and a wide shot of an old west town with a sign on a building reading ""Hotel Bastardos"" in the background. If anyone has any info on this episode, please write to me. My address is jliosatos@hotmail.com. I was hoping it would be included on the bonus disc in this set, but unfortunately it's not. Was this part of the Young Ones, or was it another show with the same actors? And where does this episode fit in with the rest of The Young Ones, season 1 or 2?"
4,love it or hate it,"people are very very divided about this show, at least in my experience. I think it's funny but a lot of the jokes are going to go over your head (not because they're smart, just dated and british). but the ones that are funny are very funny. think of it as a live-action family guy."
5,"Everything British humor (or is that ""humour""?) should be!","This is a fantastic series that alternates between funny at the most base level, to surprisingly smart, witty dialogue warranting laughs all around. There's a reason ""JumptheShark.com"" has this listed in the ""never jumped"" category!"
3,Incomplete collection makes me mad ...,"The Young Ones is an incredible TV show, and was shown uncut in the US on MTV back in 1987-1989. Unfortunately BBC America has NEVER been kind enough to package the entire series without cutting it to ribbons....The musical sequence is missing from 'Cash' and the subliminal frame flashes have been removed!!!Why?? Can't they atleast place an explaination on the disk to explain why this show is always mutilated from its original artistic package of the eighties?? ... Aside from that, this 20 year old TV series is still brilliant, and the overall collection/package is perfect. If kids see this today, it still holds up exceptionally well since nothing has been made since that is quite as mean spirited and creatively diverse for television. A must have for TV/humor lovers, but a sadly edited version, even if it is more complete then the VHS and recent TV versions."
4,"Almost, but not quite perfect.","You've already got episode synopsis and whatnot from other reviews, so I'll skip that. This set is definately the bomb. However, with the exception of adding the Dexy's Midnight Runner's back into the episode entitled BOMB, there is no difference from this and the VHS versions, as some episodes are missing sections. Some are small(one or two lines in NASTY and OIL) and others are whole scenes (The musical number in CASH). However, as said before it's the frigging Young Ones on DVD! get the frickin DVD already!Naturally, the third disc is the main reason for the boxset, as the episode of Filthy, Rich, and Catflap and the episode of Bottom possibly means that BBC Video is thinking of releasing them to the states, which is perfectly fine with me! The episodes are Filthy, Rich, and Catflap episode 1 where Richie has been hit with a paternity suit, and the Bottom episode is entitled SMELLS, where Eddie and Richie get pherome spray to help them ""catch the birds""."
4,"Maybe Stoopid, but funny","This show was broadcast on MTV, in the 1980's.It was hilarious for the time; however, the humor was sometimes hard to get because it was aimed at British audiences.I got it for my son for Christmas, and he playedall three discs Christmas day.It definitely was worth watching; despite some of the dry humor."
5,British comedy!,"This is the cheapest that you will find it, even on Ebay. If you like the young ones its a must have!"
5,"Uncut, with credits","To the person wondering if the DVD version has the credits, the answer is YES. I know what you're asking when it comes to ""Oil"". Yes, there are credits.These are the original UNCUT versions of the show. MTV and Comedy Central would sometimes cut a few scenes out, but this copy is uncut.Slightly better quality, video wise, than VHS, but not by a huge amoung. And hey...it's DVD, so it's not going to lose quality.Definitely worth the buck."
4,For Young Ones-aholics...,These were a lot funnier when I was 16... But my 9yr old loves them. Product is great though. Shipped promptly & I received it within about a week. Worth the money if you ever enjoyed the show.
3,Buyer beware!,"This DVD won't play on your computer if you use Real One player, or Windows Media Player. PowerDVD won't play it either.It works fine on a regular DVD player.All twelve episodes of this brilliant 1980's British sitcom are included on two disks, with a third disk containing some rather weak bonus material. Typical BBC.Avoid the bonus episodes of ""Filthy Rich and Catflap"" and ""Bottom"" unless you're a masochist. Both are awful, even by UPN standards.This set is great for the hard core fan of the series, but definitely NOT worth the 50 dollar purchase price most retailers are asking for it.Get it used if you can."
2,bad quality DVD,"I really love the Young Ones. This DVD, unfortunately, is of a very bad quality. In almost every episode on the second disc, there are one-second clips inserted into the show. Make no mistake, these are not intentional. For example, the episode ""Nasty"" has a very short clip of someone making pottery. (There's another inserted clip in the same episode.) It's way too short for a normal audience to understand what it is. You definitely have to pause the show at the right place to see what's happening. They also don't mention the clips in the credits, and after speaking with other people who have different Young Ones DVDs, I have confirmed that this was not intended for the show. I recommend buying another DVD of the Young Ones and not this one.Of course, if I'm wrong on this guys, feel free to say it. I'm very baffled by this DVD."
1,toy cars,the cars were varied and plentiful for the price . The down side was the weels no ruber plastic wheels which prevent the cars from rolling well and very thin axels which bend easy . However the cars were purchased for a two year old they had no removable parts so are safe and provided hours of distraction for the two year old .
5,Great book,Have the paper back edition as well. This was made into one of the A & E Series of the same name. A must read.
2,One of my least favorite in the series,"A young boy offers to split a case to Wolfe and is murdered for his troubles. Archie, the man responsible for bringing the boy to see Wolfe in a fit of pique, is deeply troubled and forces Wolfe to pursue the matter. THE GOLDEN SPIDERS touches home with this beginning, but sadly loses focus with a more traditional approach when other elements enter the story. Even though the case is solved, it always struck me as irritating that the boy's mother who is used so well by Stout earlier in the story, is totally ignored by its end. I always found this emotional distance a bit off-putting about this book; it's almost like Stout was afraid of allowing his characters more than one human moment. For this reason this is one of my least favorite of the Wolfe series."
3,confusing,And not very compelling either. I found this to be a sub-par entry in the Wolfe series. One of the most interesting parts of the investigation (Archie trying to give away $5000 and watching for reactions) didn't seem to go anywhere. I just didn't find this a very good book.
2,Not my cup of hemlock.,"Although Wolfe is an interesting character, I found the mystery itself confusing and, in the end, uninteresting. However, I have never been a fan of hard boiled mysteries myself. If you are, you may enjoy it a lot more than I did."
4,Kindle User? Wait! Don't Buy This Version!,"I love Rex Stout, and have been supplementing my ink-and-paper copies of his books with Kindle versions this spring. I therefore picked up several Nero Wolfe books on Kindle at once, including this one for $5.99 andSome Buried Caesarfor $7.99. Tonight I finished the latter novel, only to discover that The Golden Spiders is included in the Kindle edition of Some Buried Caesar, even though that fact isn't mentioned in the product description. Save yourself some money and just pick up Some Buried Caesar."
5,Beutifully Written and Insightful,"This deeply personal book is beautifully written and one of the most insightful books I have ever read about race. Berger has done a remarkable thing, writing about a subject that often generates a lot of heat but little light with an emotional connection that is as moving as it is smart and refreshing. At a time when America is more divided by race than ever, this book should be required reading for every American."
5,Ball of Fie,This is one of my favorite screwball comedies. It used to keep me company as a teenage babysitter. It's wonderful that it is now on DVD.Gary Cooper is so charmingly shy. Barbara Stanwyck was gorgeous and funny. The supporting cast is fabulous.
3,Who says scholarly reseach is cut and dried?,"When Gary Cooper (!) and the other scholars at work on the next issue of the encyclopedia realize that they need a consultant about slang, they are lucky enough to encounter showgirl Barbara Stanwyck, who tells them ""all"" about it. She's not on the level, though, and is playing Gary and the old boys for a bunch of patsies as she's on the lam. However, the power of love is a strange thing, and can even reform a slangy showgirl like Barbara. Cute movie, with very campy naive performance from Cooper."
4,Good movie,Another fun movie with Gary Cooper. An interesting take on Snow White and the seven dwarves.
3,Entertaining light-weight fare!,"A wry modern reworking of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" this film proves to be a fitfully amusing, light-weight romp, agreeably cast with willing players. One drawback: Billy Wilder's and Charles Brackett's umpteenth witty collaboration is allowed to go on too long by director Howard Hawks, who has been more energetic in his comedy efforts previously. Still, miles ahead of today's 125-minute comedies!"
4,Cooper Was Not A Comedian,"This movie has a great cast but turns out to be a hoakie romp. Barbara is hot and Gary is made up to be a lint ridden, aged beyond his years, professor. The movie lost some of the humor with poor timing and too much time spent making Cooper to appear old.Directing made it better than it should have been. It's cute but don't wait for the sequel."
2,love the movie - hate this transfer,"As this is the only way you can get this movie right now- there's nothing for it. Please be aware though that the framing on this release is COMPLETELY messed up. People's heads getting chopped off and such. I am familiar with this movie as I have a Criterion Laserdisc release from many years ago (LD player starting to die, so I wanted a replacement). If you are familiar with Criterion, you know that their releases are always respectful of the film. This version was not. If you have no other way to see this film, I highly recommend it. Otherwise, hope for another release."
2,Overpriced for a bare-bones DVD,"Terrific film, but a $20 retail price for a DVD with absolutely no extra features? What is MGM thinking? No, thanks. This film deserves better."
4,Ball of Fire,"This is a remake of a remake, because the plot is so great. The best thing is Danny Kaye did a remake about 9 years later ""A Song is Born"" - I bought this film so I could watch the 2 together, but ""A Song is Born"" is only available in VHS. The only problem is it comes in Black and White."
2,"Nice Try, But No Cigar","BALL OF FIRE---(1941)---Barbara Stanwyck, Gary Cooper, Dan Duryea, Dana Andrews, S. Z. Sakall, Oscar Homolka, Richard Haydn, Henry Travers.A variation on the, ""Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs(Dwarves--SP.?)"" fairy-tale. As much as I love Barbara Stanwyck, this film just didn't age very well given its preoccupation with outdated American slang and the barely credible(even for the movies) ""love-story"" between Stanwyck and Cooper. Duryea and Andrews, who are both good actors, just don't ""cut it"" in their roles."
2,BALL OF CORN,"This film is cute, but lacks the cleverness and comedy of other comedies in the genre.It's the basic bad woman seduces innocent man set-up. but unlike ""bringing up baby,"" ""the lady eve,"" and ""mr. deeds goes to town"" the love story is completely unbelievable.i couldnt wait for this one to end."
3,"Good, not great","I've had problems with the leg band in other brands of boxer-briefs become too stretched out after a few washes, meaning they become no different than boxers. These are comfortable and seem to be holding up fairly well after several washes."
1,"Good quality material, size is WAY smaller than rated","I ordered these in XL (40-42) and they fit like a 36. Most of my 40 boxers are almost too large but these 40-42 I can barely get on they are so tight. At first I thought I was sent the wrong size, but the label right on the boxers says XL 40-42. I will be returning them."
3,"Great boxers, but sizing chart is off","These boxers feel great and are made of good material. The only thing that was wrong was that the sizing chart said a Small is size 30-32, but it clearly says on the bag that a small is 28-30. Still fit, however."
2,It's ore is bad,It's too long for M size i didn't expect that and it's ore is bad it's too classic to wear it . i don't like it
4,Just like the picture except for one thing.,"I bought according to the price chart that the amazon affiliate provided.So after they arrived, I noticed they were bigger than I had thought. The size chart on the packaging was a little different from the one provided. Thus my husband’s was a little too big for him!Overall the design is nice, my husband said that they’re very comfortable."
4,Standard boxers,"These are pretty good. They are a little long in the leg, but that's most likely a personal preference. The quality of the cotton is good, as well as the waistband."
2,To Stretchy - Loose their Shape,"These are 75% cotton and 25% polyester and consequently are very poor at holding their shape. These will hang very loose and closely approximate traditional boxers. I originally bought the Hanes 95% cotton / 5% spandex Boxer Brief Underwear and ordered these by mistake. Beware, if you're looking for the more form fitting, shape holding pair, these are not them. If you like a lot of room to roam in your underwear, these are definitely for you."
5,"Hanes Classics Men's 4-pack Multi-Color Boxer Brief, Grey/Black",Purchased these for my hubby. They seem to be well made and comfy. Always a good value and I will purchase these again.
2,elastic band lasts less than a year,"They're nice when they're new, but the waist and leg bands last less than a year, at which point you've got ugly boxers instead of comfy briefs."
4,Very comfortable. Good price,These briefs are better than the regular hanes boxer briefs and the cost was a reasonable price. I like these a lot.
2,Second purchase is different length from first purchase,"I bought these because i loved the way my first purchase of these boxer brief fit, especially in length. So thinking, i was getting the same fit, i bought another set. I was disappointed to find that these revised boxer briefs are NOT the same as the original boxer briefs. First the the length is almost 3 or 4 inches longer, almost looking like shorts. Second, the fit is all-around loose, and not close-fitting as I would've preferred."
1,Terrible Purchase!,One pair had a huge hole in the crotch. Worst purchase ever. The reason I bought new ones is because my old one's have holes in them!!!!!
4,Not the greatest but works,I got these recently. They're not the highest quality. Not like the Perry Ellis one's I have but they work. I'm a size ~33 waist and ordered the large since I don't like tight underwear. The large fit me nicely but the thighs are slightly tight. After breaking them in they feel nice and I don't notice them.I thought about returning them but gave them a second chance and now I'm glad I kept them.
5,Exactly what I expected,Comfortable and not to tight like some boxer briefs. Gives you the breathing room you need but still coming up between your legs making them excellent for working out. I plan to buy more in the future.
1,Seriously these are cheaper at the local target.,I returned theses because you can get the same item for 7 dollars at target. Why spend more money than you need too.
2,Not as good as the store!,"I bought some briefs from Kohls a couple of months ago and got the best briefs ever. They were expensive at the time so I figured perhaps it may be cheaper on Amazon.I found the exact same briefs I bought at Kohls for 1/2 the price, BUT.......!These new briefs from Amazon SUCK! The quality is nothing like Kohls. The material from Kohls is 95%Cotton and 5%Spandex. I enjoy a tight fit and these new briefts are 75%Cotton and 25%Spandex. These new briefs do not hug my legs and ride up. They are already streched out and the material is poor. I am very disapointed in these briefs and will be getting my briefs from Kohls."
2,No Fly,One of the four briefs came with the fly sewn completely shut. I'm not sure whether that was a gross oversight in quality control or someone's idea of a joke.
2,Cheaply made...,"Cheaply made w/ thin material. In an experiment, I purchased boxer briefs from BVD, Fruit of the Loom and Hanes. Hanes (this product) rated the worst at 2 stars, Fruit of the Loom is slightly better at 3 stars and BVD's are the best (but still not perfect) at 4 stars."
4,Not bad,"Good product, runs a tad large. I have a 31 waist but I think the small would have fit better."
4,Good enough,"These has decent size and comfort for me. However, it is not top quality as I experienced with other brand product but it is good enough for normal wear. I used to wear Perry Ellis ones from outlet which was around similar price and think they are a bit better in quality. Considering the convenience of ordering from Amazon, I would order and use this product again later though."
4,good but too big,"good product,but after I followed the size guide too big for me I wished I had bought M instead of L"
3,Eh......,You can get better boxers for cheaper at any marshalls or tj maxx for the same price.I found these to be pretty thin. My boys don't seem to mind though.
5,Just what I was expecting,"It is underwear after all! Can never go wrong with Hanes! Perfect fit, perfect support. I always get what i expect with this brand."
2,They do ride up.,Hard to find good boxer briefs that don't ride up your legs. I am neither fat nor skinny and I am constantly pulling the legs back down. Don't believe the promise that they won't ride up. In fairness a lot of other boxer briefs I buy do the same.
4,Product pretty good,"The boxers are decent. The cut is okay. I ordered the size corresponding to my waist but they are still a little big on me. they don't hug my thighs the way i would like them to. Still, they look okay."
5,Great quality for a good price,"I was planning on buying some ck briefs but I was lucky and saw this in the process,I can honestly say that they are very close in quality at a great price, this so far have work perfectly and are very comfortable.My suggestion would be: If you plan on buying quality at a good price go for it, unless you want premium at a premium price."
2,Failed to meet expectations,"When I first received these Hanes Classics Men's 4-Pack Multi-Color Boxer Brief Underwear, I was pleased with their fit and comfort. After a couple of washes ( on gentle cycle in cold water and without over drying) I noticed that the there were little strings coming out around the waistband on a couple of pair. Not long after this the stitching continued to come apart and the waistband began separating from the boxer briefs.I therefore cannot recommend these. I can however recommend theHanes CSWB Boxer Briefs. They are comparably priced and seem to be better made with a nice comfortable fit."
2,cheap but bad quality and not durable,"cheap but bad quality and not durable, I rated it two star because it is cheap boxer.I do not recommend to get it."
2,Baggy,They used to be shorter and tighter. They are too baggy. Son could not wear them so we gave them to a friend. This is the brand that we bought about two years ago and they were a MUCH better fit then. They must have done something to their sizing.
4,"Good length, order smaller next time","I can't get good drawers down here in Aus. No matter what store I go to (heck even Kmart!) I can't get good boxer briefs. Its all trunks, y fronts or banana hammocks. Not happening.I like the Hanes boxer briefs they have the right length on the leg to prevent chafing during long runs but I think I ordered one size too big. I know I have lost weight but I experienced a brief feeling of grannie panties when I tried them on for the first time. Which is ok, I'd rather start too large and shrink them in the wash than too small and cut off my circulation.I'll order from here again though that's for sure. Good product, great quality. And they arrived very quickly in the mail."
2,Is amazon selling knock-offs?,"I have old pairs of Hanes that I bought in stores recently and the pack I received from Amazon doesn't compare in regards to quality of material. The band is not as durable as the packs I bought in stores. Also, I don't know if this just happened to me but I bought a pack of mediums and my pack came with 3 mediums and 1 extra large... Definitely returning this item asap.Also had issues with a pair of Levi 527 jeans I bought off Amazon which turned out to be knock-offs which is why I question buying clothes off of Amazon now."
4,Basic Men's Underwear,"Fit true to size, no issues with the leg or waist bands, and they are about what you'd expect from Hanes Boxers, which is basic and functional underwear. No complaints."
1,Favorite airs and Dances,"I previously bought this record WHEN I HAD A PHONOGRAPH! I do not have a phonograph now, so how am I able to play this album. Secondly I was told the item was in immaculate condition which couldn't be farther from the truth. Th record was scratched and filthy. The record sleeve (Album) was worn and tattered with tears along the side of the album. Finally and most disturbing the actual album was shipped in a USED pizza box!!!!! I will never purchase a used album from Amazon again! I rate this album and entire experience a Minus 5."
1,Absolutely horrible.,"I read one other C. Edwards book, and it was good. But this one was an exbarrassment. It had a lot of potential, considering it was a true story of the author's ancestors. But the dialogue sounded like it was written by a 4th grader - terse, and too flowery. Oftentimes there was a ""huge"" conflict presented on one page, turn it over and the problem is magically solved. Both lead characters were so - ""wussy"" for lack of a better word. It was, sadly, a complete waste of time."
5,AWESOME LOVE STORY,"I liked this book and if it's not 100 % historically accurate, who cares. I'm reading it for the romance and the fantasy, not for a history lesson."
4,A challenging but ultimately rewarding novel,"Nadine Gordimer's prose can be difficult to follow at the initial read, but is full of thought-provoking allusions and is a book you will definitely think about for a long time. In this tale, Burger represents the man who was Nelson Mandela's lawyer in apartheid South Africa. Gordimer follows Burger's daughter as she copes with ties to her homeland, the complicated issue of white and black in South Africa, and with both the persecution and expectations she faces because of her name. Highly recommended!"
5,Classic character study,"I can't understand the reviewers who have downplayed this book. I think maybe they should stick to the thrillers and bodice-rippers in the bus station rack. Gordimer's book is a classic study of the conflicts between ones duty to ones country - in this case, the struggle for a non-racialist South Africa - and ones duty to ones family. The story is told through the eyes of the daughter of a pair of white, South African activists. We watch her as she grows up, hurt and bemused by, then running away from, and eventually coming to her own very personal terms with, the burdens she bears because of her parents commitment. It's a wonderful character study, often enigmatic, due to the ambivalent feelings Rosa Burger experiences, but ultimately very satisfying."
2,Proust move over,"Fascinating struggle the author speaks of, namely, escaping the confines of one's parents' life, ideas, and reputation. For me, the book's undoing is its language. Half-page sentences make it difficult to read, even boring at times."
3,Gorgeous illustrations; stupid and annoying text,"The illustrations are just gorgeous and I love that the main characters are African-American children. The only reason I decided not to buy this book after reading it at a friend's is the incredibly annoying and repetitive text. I think I would just go crazy reading this over and over to my toddler. I wish the text were better thought out because if it were, this book would be such a winner."
3,"Please Puppy, more","The pictures in this book were awesome, but the choice of words was boring and my daughter had trouble saying them. It wasn't even a fun tongue twister."
5,Don't Go Puppy,"""Please, Puppy, Please"" is about two kids that have a puppy and they want to play with him, but the puppy keeps doing silly things. They try to give him a bath, but he runs from the tub. The puppy finally stops running and being silly.I liked the book. I really liked the puppy and the way he kept playing. I liked the pictures too!"
2,Stops Working After One or Two Years,"I bought the unit approximately 18 months ago and it suddenly will not recognize any discs placed in the carousel (spins but reads 'No Disc', whether brand new or previously used, or CDs or DVDs. Although I have yet to contact Sony about possible fixes for the machine, comments by other purchasers have not been encouraging. It is likely my next DVD player will not be a Sony."
1,"Worked fine for 19 months, then crashed.","The disk changer drawer struggles to open and close. When it does open, and I insert a disk and close the drawer, it just spins the table and then opens the drawer again. There are no error messages displayed on the screen, and there are no loose disks stuck in the machine. I searched the net for any clues to this problem, and found nothing other than a tech bulletin referring to some ""recall"" corrections. The Sony Web site was useless. Purchased in May, 2002, and it is not a ""high use"" system. Enjoyed it until now, but I expect better reliability of this equip."
3,multi-disc dvd changer player,When they post a item on amazzon it should be in full detail and all instructions tobe sent to buyer at the same time. Also should contact info. if having problems setup system so they can get help from some one.
4,Its nice,I have had this DVD player for years. I have not had any problems with it yet. It froze a couple of months ago but other than that nothing.
1,Stops working after 2 years,"The player completely powers off during cd play. It's completely random, meaning it could play through a cd perfectly fine, and then the next time, shut off halfway through the cd. Theses cds are new and not scratched. Also, DVDs skip, even when no scratches exist. As other opinions state, I too have had good luck with Sony in the past which is why I purchased this model. I will probably have to toss this player(it would be immoral to sell it to someone else) and buy another non-Sony product."
1,Frustrated,"I received the DVP-NC600 as a gift for Xmas 2001 from my wife. I had a Sony 5-disk CD hanger that I bought in 1994 that worked like a champ (I gave it to my folks), so I was initially excited about the gift. It almost immediately started with problems, mainly on 'track shuffle' it would shut itself OFF after about 20 minutes of play. Now it will shut off periodically when just playing a single CD. It also struggles with some DVD's to just keep up - often 'freezing' the video out while the drive churns through the disk to retrieve the data. This isn't just with rental disks - it happens with new disks as well. Sony customer service told me to ""unplug it for 1 minute"" to reset the memory, and a factory service under warranty did not resolve the issue. As a loyal Sony customer (I have a STR-D560Z receiver), I am more than disapointed in how things turned out. As an design engineer, the ""unplug it"" advise was a joke - the product obviously has a bug."
2,"Good for a Year, then bad","I got the Sony DVP NC600 as a home theater system for Christmas in 2001. It was great and very easy to hook up. It worked great. However, after a year the CD player will play a music CD for about 30 mins and the whole system will then just power off by itself. The warranty expired, and now Sony wants me to pay a min of [$$$] to fix. Unbelieveable! Would I purchase another Sony CD player, probably not for a long time."
2,Long awaited crash and burn...,"Well I will start with the positive. I purchased this unit the last part of May of 2002. and until this last week (06-05-06) It has been a VERY good and reliable product. The unit has more features than the average person will use and WAS very reliable for anything I used it for. I began getting a no disc error or insert disc message and thought ok nothing big needs the lens cleaned. Well I bought a 10.00 Maxell DVD Lense cleaner last night at wal-mart and it would even read that. I called Circuit City (store of purchase) Guess what out of warranty but call Sony. Called Sony ""We have an exchange for that item of 141.00. I didn't pay that much for it newhat the heck...I am very upset with Sony and there quality of workmanship/products. As far as I am concerned I will not be purchasing or recommending their products for anyone.Sincerly-Electronics Technician/Sales"
2,Poor sound!,"...The picture quality and the 5-disc changer are great. However, the sound is pathetic. I own a quality 54"" big screen with great speakers, but I have to turn the volume up full blast just to hear CD music or the voice dialogue from a DVD. What a disappointment. It may work better with a 5.1 receiver, but I don't think I will keep it long enough to find out."
1,In for second repair,"The unit I bought began freezing and pausing during DVD and skipping during CD play after the 30 day trial period. I sent it back to Sony repair center and they tagged a different problem (jittery picture) which they claimed they fixed. When I got the unit back, the original problem was still there along with a new problem, jittery picture. While I await it's repairs once more, I have read several other reviews from Sound and Vision readers and Audio Review to see that my problem is not unique. Others have reported the same problems. There is some serious defects or flaws in this unit making me wish I never bought it. That said, I do like all the features if I can just get a unit that doesn't fail."
1,Product starts failing after 1 year (warranty period....),"There is nothing worse than a product that starts failing just after the 1 year warranty period. Problem is skipping and stopping in the middle of CD's and DVD's. I started happening only occasionally and I thought it might be dirty disks - but soon realized that it occured on new disks and worse - it starts happening more and more frequently. From all the other reviews I see that I am not alone and this must be a reliablity problem with at least this Sony DVD player. At this point, I am checking to see if there is anything I can do to fix this thing cheaply but most likely this 1 1/2 year old DVD player is heading to the dump."
5,Great device,"This device is perfect to move from room to room, or take with you. Very pleased. Great price."
2,Okay Sound but LOUD Power On,"I agree with everyone that says the unit has decent sound. That aside, the real positive is the price because it has a couple annoying issues that I hoped were unique to mine but I found out later I wasn't alone. Okay, the problem, the unit does not remember your last volume setting so when you turn it on, it's start out very loud. Also, the speaker pops occasionally. A-L suggested I lower the line output of my receiver to minimize the volume issue but that's a lame solution. As for the popping, the instructions tell you to turn on the XM receiver or mp3 player first to minimize the problem but it's not totally effective. Word is from A-L that the popping occurs at the end and start of songs. In summary, all I can say is, I'm glad it was expensive."
1,Altec Lansing,"Altec Lansing has decent prices but the products are shoddily made. If they work, they're ok, but most likely they'll break in some small way the day after the warranty expires. If you can understand their support people- it helps if you've been to Mumbai-all they seem capable of doing is reading company policy to you.Twice I've been seduced by their prices-both times I've been burned. I would never use them again, ther're too many manufacturers who take pride in they're product and service."
5,I love this product,"I couldn't have been happier with this purchase. It was everything I hoped for. For the money, you couldn't find more clarity in sound. It is definitely worth buying. I use it when I'm camping and have no access to television. I am able to hear the news and music without turning on a television. Who needs a picture anyway."
1,odd to start,"It was odd getting used to the larger plastic stems, but after a few days, they feel very good in your hand. The pattern is pleasant. We love them now.***addendum: after only three weeks use, the pattern has begun to rub off! Just average use for such a short period, what a shock! I couldn't recommend this set to anyone. The primary reason you buy this set is to match the pattern with french quarter stoneware, what a disappointment. I'm going to contact the manufacturer...."
1,junk,"All it is, is pretty. After you have used it for a while the silver piece comes out of the handle. I was eating & the fork prons stayed in my mouth when I pulled the handle to remove it. My daughter was washing a fork by hand & as she was wiping the prons they came out in her hand.don't waste your money unless you want to keep on replaceing it."
1,Poorly made,"I have had this flatware for a couple years. The handles come loose, the design fades, and they will rust and break.The pieces look pretty, but they will not hold up.Marge"
5,Great WW2 adventure novel,"Wow!The author has gone to great lengths to protray the U-boat crew as protagonists without making the Allied characters into mindless, cruel automatons as lesser skilled authors may have done. This is not a simple task.Iron Coffin is a great novel and sure to thrill any WW2 or adventure reader. There is great attention to detail and the entire novel rings mainly believable - although I think there may be too much painting of the U-boat officers as excessively anti-Hitler. Perhaps, in hindsight, this was necessary to justify the plot and ending.Buy this book and read it. You won't be disappointed."
5,Unbelievable story!,"Wow! That is my best description of an amazing, captivating story. I was intrigued with the jacket cover describing a German U-boat operating in the Gulf during WWII, but never expected the story I read. The characters were so vivid and unique, on both sides, that it was hard not to like any of them. The setting was so well written that I felt myself twisting and turning though the Louisiana bayou. If you enjoy believable action, unforgettable characters, a story that is hard not to enjoy, and good writting, this is a novel for you."
5,The best of the genre,All three of Mannock's books are exceptional. Many of us have read countless renditions of WWII fictional efforts...this is the best of the genre.
4,It's a hit...,"I read John Mannock's SEN-TOKU RAID before this one, and it took me a while to hunt up a copy of IRON COFFIN, but it was definitely worth the hunt.I wasn't that in love with the ""frame"" story, but once we got into the action I was hooked. This guy Mannock is going to be here for a while, I reckon. I recommend fans of a good fast-paced action yarn hunt this puppy up and give it a try.I'm definitely keeping an eye out for his third book.Steve Vernon"
2,The Pike Palette ring a bell,I bought the book based on the cover I have no where near the watercolor skill as John Pike had. But this book is rather dated from the 70s and has paintings reproduced in black and white! I'm not sure how much you can learn from Black and White paintings that are suppose to be in color.
1,does not fit,dont buy this product. it may say it will fit to your 92-95 honda civic plug. but the pulg is differentdo not buy
1,Remember the movie Toy Story?,"Remember the movie Toy Story, when Mr Potatohead was cruising the aisles with Tour Guide Barbie in the Fisher-Price Power Wheels Corvette? This horn will make any car into the Fisher-Price Barbie Car. Yes it was easy to install and yes, it does work, but if your a guy, any car you drive will instantly become Pink and made of plastic, not to mention, you will never have sex again."
5,Kudos!,"I find the product just perfect for my car. I liked the higher pitched sound and the shiny finish on it. Seller is honest and item was shipped fast and in exact sealed condition as listed. Price is reasonably fair and yes, seller is highly recommendable and so with product. Super buy and seller I must say!"
4,nice,nice tea. The bag is not made for storage so I shrink wrapped the whole thing to maintain freshness. I would buy this again and again
4,Calvin Klein Men's Basic Brief,"These briefs are well-made, and are one of the few brands that still use numerical sizing. Those two facts alone make them a singular value.The material isnt heavy nor does it look very durable, but then nothing is any more. The fit runs larger than the size on the label. With that noted, like I said they still try to use actual size info, they fit well (if you order one size smaller), and are comfortable. They are made in Thailand according to the tag.That is a rare combination of attributes. I will buy these again."
4,comfy,"ordered these for my boyfriend...size 34. He said they are comfortable, but not quite as high as he likes for briefs. Otherwise, a great product. :)"
2,ran large. returned,"The sizing of this product seems very inconsistent. It's hard to match what we have, which is large. I get the large and they're too big; I get the medium and it's too small."
3,U2000 vs U1000: Calvin Klein,"For many years I bought the Calvin Klein Men's Briefs, model U2000 (found on label tag), and was very happy; they fit perfectly. I bought a recent package and they were ""skimpy"" with the same size. Then I checked the label and it was U1000, not U2000. I went to all the department stores, discounters, etc and cannot find the old U2000. I tried the other brands....Jockey, Fruit of the Loom, Almani, etc but they too are skimpy. The only competitor that comes close, if you can believe it, is Sear's ""Covington"" house brand. Nevertheless, I want my old U2000s back:) Can anyone tell me where to find this model? Thanks."
2,low quality fabric,It fits comfortable but the fabric is not as expected.It's a little coarse and obviously weak and doesn't seem that could endure much.
2,"Disappointed with these, go with Tommy's instead","I am not very happy with these, they don't hold their shape that long, had a much better luck with Tommy's Classic Brief. Go for them instead."
3,Calvin Klein Basic Brief - 3 Pack (U1000),I was hoping to get U 2000's but the 1000's are fine.Delivery was quick.
1,Quality has dropped,"I have used CK for a number of years (~8 years) but it seems that the quality has changed with my last order. CK used to mean quality ... Not anymore. These are thin material,, weak bands, etc. Just cheap!"
2,CK's no longer fit like always before,"I've bought these Calvin Klein briefs for at least ten years and they've always fit perfectly, but this shipment definitely does not. they are to ""short"" .. they've decreased length, or amount of material between the waistband and legs, making you constantly want to tug them higher but if you do they pull around the legs at the bottom. uncomfortable. disappointing. guess I will have to find another brand."
4,Worth the price paid.,"Juuuuust a little big large. Cotton feels good, thick and soft, not tight at all. not a low waist model."
2,Holes already,Shocking - holes developing already come on CK ths can't be right. Any comments elsewhere as I am surely not alone? Not worth a premium price.
4,Calvin's,A bit more expensive but fits well lasts long and has softer cotton than hanes. This word requirement keeps me from reviewing products
3,Briefs review,I could have used a smaller size. That could be a good thing. Calvin klein is a good brand. I would continue to buy it.
1,where is my stuff?,i did not see it. where is it? where is it !!I paid money but did not get anything
4,good item at very good price,"as a good brand, good quality is guaranteed and also was at a very good price."
1,shrinkage problem,I have been buying these briefs for 10 years and this is the first time that I have had shrinkage problems with them. The must have gone from a size 42 to a 38 after the first washing.
1,size 30 is size 34,"I like the fit of these underware, however, I ordered 5 pair of black ones that came from Macys. The waist band indicates size 30. But actually they are size 34+. $10.00 a pair for 5 pair.Cant return then so stuck with underware big enough for a linebacker."
2,Hanging Out in the Overlap!,"I have worn these briefs for years and loved them. However, on my most recent purchase, (from Macys) I experienced the same ""lack of overlap"" as a previous reviewer. I thought it was just me. I don't know if it is a flaw in production or a style change, but if it is a style change, I don't like it. If I run up stairs or make other less active moves, my ball sac completely comes out of the briefs between the fly."
4,Comfortably soft!,"These have to be some of the most comfortable underwear that I have ever purchased or owned. They fit very well and tend to be of a thicker, higher-quality fabric than many other brands of men's briefs. Better yet, the fabric tends to stay soft even after several washings. I do have to note, however, that I have had a minor issue with the gray-colored variety. They are NOT simply the classic white ones that have been dyed; they are made slightly differently. Their elastic leg bands are NOT nearly as durable, so I have stayed put with the whites."
4,Almost A Great Product,"Almost a great product, that fit perfectly, it is well made and very comfortable. However, the fabric at the front of the brief doesn't overlap too much which can cause you to ""slip"" out the front."
2,Basic Brief Review.,"I got these about a year back but they seem to have shrunk. My waist is 32"" and has remained the same mean while. The briefs are of poor quality and they wear out fast. I would not recommend any basic briefs by CK whether in grey or black. I own both and have had to dispose all of them within a year. I strongly recommend GAP or H&M or even JOCKEY instead. They are more expensive but they are on the money, 7 of those boxerbriefs/briefs and you are good to go. If you are buying Calvin Klein underwear please know that these 3-in-1 briefs (H&M 3 in 1's though are gorgeous) are not of the same quality as the other brands I have mentioned. Buying 3-in-1 may seem like a good idea for those who don't do laundry twice a week but they are so worn and shrunk. These became very uncomfortable to wear, my boys feel cramped."
3,They are ok.,"These are pretty comfortable, but do run a little small. If you're buying, make sure you order (1) size bigger."
2,No longer top quality!,"Same size and shape as always, but the quality of the cotton is terrible. I've been purchasing these for better than 20 years. The ones that I have that are 2 years old and been through many washes are a thicker cotton than those just purchased. Very disappointed. If you have not bought these in a while, don't buy them now. They are not the same good cotton as before."
2,cut was unflattering with loose flaps at sides,"cut was unflattering with loose flaps at sides,colour tones were flat and dull for all 3 colours ...high-rise brief would be a more accurate description forpeople who prefer mid-rise or low-rise"
4,Pretty cool little cell phone case,"I love the versatility of this case. It's a perfect size. I love the different carrying options; belt, arm, neck. But it's a pain to shift between them because of the different attachments. All in all I am very pleased with it."
1,worst horror ever,"The biggest pile of rubbish I've ever seen, the film is horribly boring, and I'm not even sure what it was about.It appears to consist of a guy boiling water, and stabbing the air for no particular reason.I've been more excited watching paint dry.Avoid this pile of lameness."
2,too superficial to be useful,"This book aims at a good target: explaining EAI to managers. To accomplish this task, the author needed full descriptions of the concepts and meaty examples to illustrate them. This book has neither.For example, the author states several times that SAP needs a richer collection of APIs in order to connect to other application. Nowhere does he describe what is missing: what functionality is hard to access in SAP that should be easy?Save your money."
5,Great EAI Book!,"I purchased this book to get a good EAI education and this book was spot on. The author does a good job in breaking EAI down to its component parts, and provides just enough technical detail to be helpful but not confusing. The graphics are very helpful. If you want to understand what EAI is, this is the book for you."
2,"Disappointing - what but not how, when, where","A disappointing book that addresses the ""what with"" but not the when, where and how of EAI. Early chapters are weak. The later ones usefully overview the possible integration levels (database, method level, user interface, etc.), what the tools and aproaches do, and their relative strengths and weaknesses. Very few examples are used and there are no case studies. There are no guidelines or framework of how to plan and select the best EAI approach. Occasionally obscure terms and concepts are used without explanation and the content is never related to a real project situation. The addition of guidelines, EAI selection criteria, real case studies and of short, pithy product reviews would help considerably."
1,"Very outdated, lacks substance",I found the material on this book to be very outdated and the coverage of the topic is very shallow. I come from a technical background and found this book to be of little value in trying to address the difficulties of application integration. Look for a different book if you want to find out about enterprise application integration.
2,A book only for entry-level students,"As an experienced EAI architect, I felt very disappointed at this book. The book aim either at high-level managers to give them an introduction of what EAI is or at students who don't know anything about EAI. It is full of lot of abstract concepts without any implementation plan or idea. Most of tech described are out of date.I think a good book talking about EAI at least should have a chapter to compare all possible integration ways and should give readers their pros and cons. Also a good should talk about EAI vendors, such as IBM, Vitria, WebMethod, etc. What they really did, how they did, what we should concern today. Of course, a case study is necessary.If you, an experienced EAI developer or architect, would like to know or get more details about how to do it, you don't need this book."
4,The technology world never stands still....,"The technology world never stands still....making the integration of technology an inevitable task for any IT Architect. In this book, David helps technologists understand the issues, and provides clear guidance as to how to design an integration architecture."
1,Weak,"How some readers find this usefull is beyond me. It should be titled ""EAI for Dummies"". It serves as the CliffNotes for ""Client/Server Survival Guide, Third Edition"" by Robert Orfali, Dan Harkey, Jeri Edwards. It really serves as a 300 page sales glossy for author's company product. Specifics: to high-level, no coding examples, filled with cliches and witty comments, technology examples are well known and already documented, replace chapter six with any book on UML. Overall, not very inspiring or usefull."
5,Passionate and insightful work,"Rennie's work is technical and hard-going in places, but he is passionate and insightful not just on bringing out the ideas of Prof. Eliade, but also on describing the character and role of religion in the modern world. The book deserves careful and thoughtful reading and study. His defense of Eliade's early political involvements seems reasonable and fair. His defense and explanation of an inclusive definition of religion are compelling and helpful. We still have much to learn from Eliade."
4,"Great Reading, Very Inspiring",This book is an excellent tool in personal motivation. A very good read that gives insight to the complex world of Wall Street.
1,Reflections of a reader,"This book is poorly written and edited. The middle section contains about 100 pages of obvious filler, consisting of descriptions and histories of several companies in which Mr. Lanyi's clients have supposedly invested. The author's attempts at humour are mostly shopworn cliches that grow tedious by the third or fourth chapter. Anyone looking for serious and intelligent investment advice would be well served by looking elsewhere. Confessions of a Stockbroker seems more of a marketing piece designed to get Mr. Lanyi more clients than an effort at educating or helping the average investor."
1,Blue Chips or No Chips,"Not only is this book not very good, it could be dangerous to you investment health. The book is tedious, especially in the slow moving middle sections. In addition, Lanyi's simplistic approach to investing ignores the tremendous risks inherent in buying small cap stocks. My advice to him: save your ""confessions"" for people not interested in making money in the stock market."
1,USED CONFESSIONS FOR SALE,"Potential readers of this book should look at the number of used books available for sale. 22 COPIES!!! If that doesn't tell you something I'm not sure what would. At some point in the near future, I expect Mr. Lanyi will have to pay people to read his book. My advice, don't take the bait; life is too short and time is too valuable. ""Confessions"" contains little of value for either the novice or experienced investor. One last comment to the guy trying to sell an autographed copy for over $20 - you're dreaming. An autographed copy is probably worth less than a normal copy."
1,St. Augustine Need Not Worry,"Look up the word meretricious in the dictionary - you'll probably see the cover of this book. This is the worst type of non-fiction- boring to read, misleading and worst of all dangerous if the ""advice"" within is followed. Is anyone else suspicious of the sample ""client portfolios"" provided? Hmmmm....a client has over a dozen positions in the portfolio and guess what - all big winners, no losers. Anyone who has spent a minimal amount of time studying the market knows this is highly unrealistic. Lanyi must think his readers are either suckers or fools. I can only assume he has something on the publisher and/or editor to get them to back this vanity project. After reading Confessions, I wondered why Amazon does not offer the option of giving a book no stars. If ever there was a book that deserved it - Confessions of a Stockbroker is it."
5,Iams Tarter Control Treats,"Not only does my dog love Iams Tarter Control Treats, but they do not cause him to vomit like greenies do. He enjoys them and they help control tarter buildup on his teeth. A great product which has become hard to find. I hope Amazon never stops carrying them and keep up the great pricing too."
5,Jump5 CD is Awesome,Jump5 is energetic and very positive. It keeps you rocking and the talent these kids have is unbelievable. I think it is an awesome CD to buy for the kids. My husband bought it for the girls having a slumber party. There was 18 girls ages 13-15 and they loved it.
5,Buy this CD today!,"When I heard the first song from this CD, I knew I had to get it! This new and hyper music group is made up of kids who have had voice and dance lessons since they were 3 or 4 years old! ""Spinning Around"" and ""Tell Me Why"" are my favorite songs on the CD because they're full of energy. But ""Change a Heart, Change the World"" and ""Love Ya' Too Much"" are also great songs becase they're a little quieter and good just to sit and listen to. All of the songs are awesome on this CD, though. If you like the groups Avalon and ZOEgirl, I think that you will definately like this CD. Get it today!"
5,AWESOME,"THERE CD IS TOTALY AWESOME !!5 STARS ALL THE WAY! I GET THE SONGS STUCK IN MY HEAD, AND WITH OTHER CD'S I GET BORED AFTER WHILE BUT WITH JUMP5 I'LL END UP WITH THERE'S FOREVER!!"
5,THE BEST CD EVER,THIS IS THE BEST CD EVER!! I LOVE JUMP5 AND THIS IS A GREAT CD THEIR NEW CD WILL BE GOOD TOO BUT I THINK THIS ONE IS GREAT!!I REALLY THINK IF YOU'RE BUYING A CD YOU SHOULD BUY THIS ONE!!!!I REALLY LIKE THE SONG SPININ AROUND ITS A GREAT SONG AND I LOVE THE SONG I BELONG TO YOU ITS THE BEST!!
5,Jump5 is the Best!,"Jump5's album ""Jump5 (Bonus Tracks)"" is the best album I have ever bought. I love this album. I especially like the song ""Spinnin' Around"" because it all the group's memebers voices are so great in this song and Brittany (the lead girl singer in this song) has the best voice. Brandon (the lead boy singer in this song and Brittany's brother) has a great voice too. This song really gets me pumped and energized and I know it will for u too. The rest of the album is really good too. The song's ""Virtual Reality"", ""All I Want"", and ""Start Jumpin' (Radio Disney Remix)"" are all good as well. So go buy Jump5's album today. U won't be sorry!*"
2,Same old pop formula...great for kids though.,"Jump 5 remind me so much of the A*Teens its pathetic. They have 2 guys, 2 girls and their first single ""Spinnin' Around"" sounds like they switched a few lyrics from ""Bouncing Off The Ceiling"" around to get the result: ""Spinning around I got this funny feeling, you turn my whole world upside down..."" The A*Teens song goes ""Upside down, bouncing off the ceiling. Inside out, stranger to this feeling..."" The kids that make up Jump 5 do have talent, however. It's just that their music sounds so familiar I had deja-vu while listening to it.Bottom line: If you are above 13 and don't care for overused bubblegum pop, don't buy this. If you are a parent and are buying for your 9 year old, buy this. It's full of fun music, that no matter what the quality, kids will love it!"
2,Pretty good,"I got this when I was first starting to like Jump5. This CD is ok, but it didn't make me want to become a crazed fan."
5,Infectious and inspiring.,This record is full of really well produced and performed music that has a great message. I can't think of anything I don't like about it.
1,"Stay very, very, very far away from Jump5","jump5 should only be played when you want to annoy someone. If you want some REAL Christian music, get dcTalk, Newsboys, POD, Steven Curtis Chapman, or my personal favorite, the new Tait album, ""Empty."" Don't buy this CD. Matter of fact just don't even think about buying it. This group has no real talent."
1,Great... if you've never heard a song in your life,"Jump-5 is just another mediocre pop group with no talent who don't write their own music, are adored by anyone who watches disney channel, and are wholesome. Yawn."
3,Might be good,"I have not heard their music, but I went to the same school as Brittany and Brandon Hargest and have heard Brittany sing. She is pretty good and if the rest of them are the same, this would be a good CD. I gave it 3 stars since i don't really know."
5,God Bless The USA is the BOMB!,~God Bless the USA is the greatest song. You can never get tired of it. I have listened to it over the internet over fifty times. And I still love it. Jump 5 sings these with all their heart and I would like to thank them for that. Its my favorite song!!!
5,AWESOME!,"IT ROCKS!IT'S JUMPY ,LIVE,ENERGIED MUSIC.THISIS THE CD YOU'LL NEVER GET TIRED WITH!!ALL THIER SONGS ARE AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,hate it,"The way i see it, this cd pretty much sukx.my mom bought it played on the stereo constantly! then i ditched it. i am a metal fan so of course i hate this cd.but i will giv it 2 stars cuz i cant sing at all! and i didnt start a band either."
4,It's about time ST went back to their roots!,"I've always been a big fan of ST's first two CDs, but never really got into their ""metal"" stuff. However, I was very pleased with this CD. If you dig the first CD, you will probably like this one. This is the type of stuff they should have kept doing all these years."
5,Love this CD,"This yet another brilliant ST album, mega aggresive but with those funky grooves just makes me wanna stomp all the time i love it one of the best albums i've got by ST every song is consistantly good and to me its almost as good as their early work (institutionalised/subliminal etc)"
3,where's the metal and thrash?,"a punk band that went metal and came back as a mediocre rehash of their punk days is never pretty. ST's punk days were raw and good. they were the part of the LA harcore punk scene and one of the best at that. near the late 80's and early 90's they went thrash metal and the name ST was put right next to metallica and bands of that nature. they evolved greatly. and then somewhere in 1997 i think..this album came out. its kind of like they grew up on how can i laugh tomorrow.. and lights camera revolution...and tried to act like immature gangsta kids here. what the hell kind of song is cyco vision?..the lyrics are horrible..the record itself isnt too bad. its a keeper to me and the speed and agression make up for the regression....mike muir must have hit a mid-life crisis here. what else would explain a pointless array of lyrics minus the metal. if you like thrash and the old ST to the end of the earth, this album will alienate you big time."
3,A perfume to die for..,"""Beware of the Bouquet"" was Joan Aiken's third adult novel, and the first good one out of that. The story follows Martha Gilroy, a coywriter for an ad agency who is still smarming from her husband abandoning her seven years before. Her boss gets a new client, a chemical company going upscale with a new, almsot irresistable perfume. Martha is in charge of shooting ads with the daughter-in-law of the CEO of the perfume company. Soon, Martha gets involved in a baby kidnapping when she discovers an up-ended carriage when she gets lost while driving. With great humor, we are taken on a ride as Martha tries to figure out who and why a baby was kidnapped. The villian here is quite obvious, but the way Martha figures things out is amusing, and there is a great scene where she throws a hot soup canister at a bad guy."
3,WAFFEN-SS UNIFORMS IN COLOR,"A VERY GOOD BASIC PHOTOGRAPHIC REFERENCE. TEXT DOES NOT ""DRILL DOWN"" IN DETAIL AS COMPARED TO ""DEUTSCHE SOLDATEN"" OR ""USMC UNIFORMS AND EQUIPMENT 1941-45."" STILL, FOR THE PRICE, THIS IS WELL WORTH THE INVESTMENT. RECOMMENDED."
4,"A good book on the subject, and a great value","This little book is a little gem, is not a very expensive title, but it works fine. The selection and descriptions of the different uniforms and components is clear and as far as I now free of mistakes. One of it's best shots are some of the same model, with the same camouflage suit a different hours, and different angles in relation with the sun. You can clearly see the huge difference and variation in colors that this can do at the moment of interpreting an old photograph and then using as reference for things like figure painting. Is a very good book."
2,American Machinist,"This purchase was for what turned out to be a photo copied version of the real thing, don't purchase, search for the real thing."
2,Poor Quality,"The first time I tried to put these on, the prong broke. How do I return them for being defective?"
4,eminent hobby,bridge and chess such as sophisticated games..thanks you for making this product..there are numerous and steeped pc games but none of them to elicit man's creative capability.
5,Read This! A Remarkable Book,"This is an astonishingly good first book, written in the tradition of great Southern novels but also inventive and wholly original. The voices circling the central characters are reminiscent of Faulkner, each one ringing true to itself and providing a different, often quite distorted, angle on the others. Paul Foster, the book's gay teenage protagonist, simply lights up the page as an unusual, complex, and heartbreaking boy-although one or two small-minded characters imagine him as a stereotype, the intelligent reader will not make this mistake. Each section of the book is told from a different point in time, leading to a broad and nuanced understanding of how change occurs and how bonds are formed between all sorts of unlikely people, more than seem possible in a book so brief. It's the work of a mature vision: hopeful but also stark and unblinkingly honest. I really can't say enough good things about this book."
3,Disappointing,"I was prepared to like this, but didn't finish it. I even loaned it to a friend who couldn't finish it, as well. Ms. Joseph does a good job of researching her topic and it shows, but the characters come off as one-dimensional and under developed. Perhaps Ms. Joseph needs to write about something closer to her heart as I get the impression that she is not that fine-tuned to her characters' predicaments."
2,Ninja Scroll 10th Anniversary Widescreen...- Beware!!,"Ninja Scroll is an excellent work of anime and cannot be praised too highly, but the new 10th Anniversary DVD edition only offers only a false widescreen - they have merely cut off the top and bottom of the view to give the appearance of widescreen. The DTS sound is not any fuller or crisper than the original fullscreen DVD, merely converted to DTS format. In short, this DVD is not worth upgrading to, and the fullscreen side is the only one worth watching. Save your money if you hope to improve on the original DVD's quality - the new anniversary DVD is actually an insult."
2,Another example of DVD editing.,"Yet again we have an excellent film (definitely among the best of all anime films) that has suffered at the hands of DVD editors. What makes the editing even more bizarre is that the scenes removed (I checked each omission against the full, VHS version)were neither gratuitous nor explicit, almost as if the scenes were cut for 'running time' reasons! There should be a law against releasing films without a warning about the cuts. Afterall, as soon as even a single minute of footage is removed post-release, it is no longer the original film, whether it be for censorship, running-time, director's cut or whatever. Get the VHS version, and ignore this DVD release."
3,"Great animation, average plot, bad dubbing.","This is a very strong movie which starts out well and keeps the action well paced. The animation is very good, though to my liking when a limb is chopped off you should be able to see bone.The plot is average. The main problem I have is that the main character, who comes up against super-powered villains, seems to be able to pull off several super-human things himself, such as still being able to pull off something not humanly possible (not enough strength) with 8 broken ribs and a broken arm.But the only annoying thing about this version of the movie is the english dubbing. Please, if you want it to be more clear get the subtitled version instead. The script can't be literally translated in the dub, since it wouldn't fit the lip movements of the characters. This makes for poor dialog exchanges that make no sense."
5,Magic,"I saw Ninja Scroll on a whim several years ago and I was blown away. It was the first anime movie that I ever saw, so I had no idea that animated features could be so impressive. The characters were amazing and diverse. The film had funny instances at times and it was deeply engaging. I was stunned with a new respect for anime."
4,Run my Ninja!,"Classic animae! This is a must have for anyone who enjoys animae, the scenes and art work is fantastic. Story line is solid, and characters are well played. Pay attention the the rating as this is not Inuyasha so not for the kiddies, but older animae fans will enjoy it."
4,A clasic is back,"This is THE clasic Ninja Anime. The story is pretty usual the traditional swordstory but it works out good. Even that the end is.... hehe no spoiler here.Unfortunately the DVD was one of the first to produce and you hear it. The 5.1 sound has it's light problems on 2-3 places, it gets a bit crispy but it is ok if you are not a hardcore high-end show lover. It is still amazing that they made this old movie into a 5.1 DVD.3 stars for the story and one for the DVD it self, nice extras and a good picture, it looks like they used the master to made this DVD.To bad the sound has its problems"
3,Violent if you like that kind of thing,"It goes overboard on the violence and sex sometimes , if you like it then this movie is for you, I found it distracting and gratuitous. It has some amazing character designs and a couple of complex characters, the dubbing was not as bad as some other Anime I have seen. The story is only decent , as are the supporting characters."
5,One of the best martial arts movies I have ever watched,"I happened to be browsing in the video store and came across ""Ninja Scroll"". It looked interesting enough to rent. Generally martial art movies (Live or animation) are hit or miss, either a good movie or why the He?? did I buy or rent this but great movies come across only once in a blue moon. This movie just stunned me, it was so intense and vibrant. The action was just spectacular. I was rewinding scenes and playing them back again and again. I was yelling out expletives. I'm originally from NY and I loved this movie."
4,Respect to the Ninja,"Ninja scroll is one of the best japanimation moves I've seen in a long time. The script and charcters were right on.It has an old fashion japanese setting that tells the tale of a Japanese Ninja who has nothing but his sword and his wits, fighting against the forces of evil. This move is awesome. Why don't they have more movies like this?"
5,NO FEAR,"early in the movie you'll see a rain of blod... this was my first MANGA movie ever and i still thik it's the best i've seen so far. let's put it in short: kids, DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME...y?... u'll just have to see for yourself..."
5,Jubei is the man!,"Ninja Scroll is without doubt, one of the best pieces of anime ever made. The story and characters are excellent and the combat sequences are up there with the best. The quality of the animation surpassed my expectations. It makes many of my other titles look quite pathetic in comparison. I can't describe how brilliant this movie is. Every real anime fan should own it."
5,one hell of a plot with a lot of twist and turns,"a story of drahma,love and violence. Just the way all the japanese anime should be. I'll tell you if you really dig old school sword fights and blood and superb animation. Ninja Scroll is a must have for any hardcore anime fan."
2,Ninja Droll,"Okay animation + convoluted plot + extended graphic anime violence + brief anime nudity = a movie any 14-year-old boy should love. Unfortunately, not many of us are fourteen years old anymore.If this is indeed a ""peak achievement of Japanese anime"" you can keep it. For those of us spoiled by classic western animation this could be a big disappointment - only the lips moves when a character speaks, static images are panned and scanned by the animators (or brought forward rapidly if the character is supposed to be running towards the camera), cels sequences are repeated over and over (a scene of a river filled with dead fish uses this trick - the same fish, in the same relation to the others, are repeated rather than freshly drawn.) On the other hand, there's a nice use of color in NINJA SCROLL and some of the fight scenes are very well rendered.Still, being mildly impressed with a scene or two doesn't make a movie recommendable."
2,Vastly overrated,"Having seen some animes and enjoyed them, I was casting around for some good animes to purchase. Stumbling across Ninja Scroll, I saw dozens of people declaring NS the best anime ever, an amazing anime, and a must-have. So I purchased it.This is far from the best anime ever. Is there a plot? Well, yes. But it's weak. Mostly there are just random fight scenes. Now, the fight scenes aren't bad, but there really needs to be more than fight scenes to make a good movie. And I don't understand why they decided to have blood spray from every wound as though someone had opened a fire hydrant.Ninja Scroll does have some cool parts, but it's mostly a weak plot full of mindless violence with some random sex thrown in. Far from the best anime ever."
2,What a load of garbage,"This movie is practically an animated porno, nothing but a cheep excuse to show nudity in a cartoon, and yet it was so damn dirty. If you're looking for a cheep thirll watch this one. The only good thing about this movie was the animation."
1,THIS IS HORRIBLE,"Unfortunatly I cannot give you a full view of the plot, because this movie was so incredibly [bad] I couldn't get to the plot. I can explain the few scenes I saw however. An epedemic is spreading and a group of warriors are trying avoid it. They are running through the woods when one man comes out and cuts them all in half. Yeah sounds awesome, but wait until you hear what comes next to judge the movie yet. The man takes a young girl back to a temple, and rapes her, that's right, rapes her. It is completly disgusting. I hoped that it was just one scene, there wouldn't be anything else like it. I fast forwarded to the next scene, yet another sex scene. This was the most disgusting anime i have ever seen in my life. Why it is so popular is beyond me, I cannot believe people are actually applauding a movie as shallow as this. The art may be good, there is no denying that, but it is how the art is used to carry along the action and plot that counts, not the quality of the art itslef."
1,Garbage occasionally dressed up nicely.,"This film is incoherent and at times descends into onanistic violence. The only redeeming quality of this film is that the characters are a little bit creative.The story is utter nonsense and serves only to further the grotesque bloodbaths that for some reason are proffered to the audience. Many believe it to contain a ""strong female character."" Don't kid yourself, this movie is more chauvenistic than any I have seen in a long time.If you like violence for the sake of violence, horrid translations, weak stories, and ludicrously anti-climactic endings, this film is for you. For the rest of us, it only reinforces the anime stereotype."
1,buncha hentais...,"I can't believe you people. This is the dumbest, most perverted anime I have ever seen in my life. The action was ridiculously bloody (I've never seen blood spew out of a body like water out of a fire hydrant before), the girl had a chin the size of Texas, and the plot was ridiculously childish. If your IQ is in the double digits (or better) go for Ghost in the Shell or some other movie with a real storyline. If you want blood-spattered porn, well then, click ""add to cart."""
4,One of the best I've seen,"This is undoubtly one of the best manga movies I've seen. The plot is very well done, the characters are nicely made, and the animation is excellent. The fighting scenes are also really good. Although I wouldn't recommend this movie for children I would certainly recommend it to all other anime/manga lovers"
3,pretty good except ending,"the movie is decent, but there seems to be too much gore and nudity which is superfluous, adding nothing to the plot. also leaves a lot of loose ends, not the cool kinds that make you think (like NGE and Serial Experiments Lain) but ones that make it look like the creators didnt wanna spend the full amount of time needed to make a classic. the end is pretty stupid, from jubei and kagero ""making love"" by just kissing (while the beginning goes ahead to show fondling and doggy style with complete sound effects; not saying they should have gone that far w/ jubei and kagero, but it just shows how dumb the other scenes are) and the stupid water-kills-evil ending which is equally horrible as in mel gibson's ""signs."" there is so much good anime out there these days, and i would only recommend this if youve already seen all the rest."
3,B-Movie,"Animation aside, this movie is simply a ninja B-movie. Everything is too theatrical and extreme to really stir any emotion - except maybe for the ninja woman's character. The plot isn't too inventive - and the blind ninja thing has been used to death in so many movies. As for animation, I've heard someone comparing this to Akira - but you really can't, Akira is much more fluent and detailed. Then again, maybe it's just me - I've never loved martial arts films. By the way, I think the film's use of gore simply made it a bit ridiculous - it's highly unrealistic for blood to gush out of an open wound like from a fire-hose."
2,Mediocre Ultraviolence,"I decided to watch this movie after hearing about how great it is and everything from my other friends who are really into Japanese anime. Before viewing it, I was warned that it was ultra violent but even that didn't prepare me for what was to come. This is without a doubt the most violent cartoon I've ever seen, and that can either be a good thing or a bad thing. Blood sprays accompany nearly every action sequence. However, I found the action sequences to be rather well done, and they were my favorite part of the film. Besides that, there isn't really much here as much of the other material is garbage. I found myself angry for watching the movie after it was over. Simply speaking, watching this movie is like eathing junk food. You know it's terrible for you but something makes you shove it down your throat anyway."
5,"Killer, the only rival to Ninja Resurrection. A must have!!!","This was one of the first anime I ever saw, too bad for most all the other anime! This is one of the top three anime ever!This is a fantastic piece. Hardcore as anything I have ever seen. I you like this, check out Ninja Resurrection.Ninja Scroll mixes fantasitc story with unbeatable animation for a top quality anime."
4,Very good except for 3 scenes,"One of the most compelling storylines I've seen in a long time. The animation and fight scenes are spectacular. The videography, even though it is animation, is very well done with good camera angles. The only problem with the movie is the female character Kagero. While she remains one of the most intriguing female characters of all time, she is the most ABUSED character of all time which leaves a sour aftertaste to an otherwise great movie."
5,SWEET MOVIE!,"This movie is universally appealing, not just to hardcore anime fans. It has an original story and great characters, plenty of nudity and sex(not too much or too little: just right), and some of the best fights you will ever see. It is suspenseful right to the climatic ending. If you are new to anime and have grown up watching U.S. kiddie crap, YOU MUST SEE THIS MASTERPIECE"
4,This was a cool film,"One thing I miss, is that the were more scenes were you saw the sword in action, that you saw the moves, and one other thing, the blood was kinda overdone. Nice drawings. =)"
3,"I give in, it's OK","For years I was telling people that Ninja Scroll was one of the worst Anime Features I had ever seen. the lack of plot was instead replaced with numerouse violence and sex scenes with an unclear villian. Finally I rented this again and watched it and after the third and final viewing of this, I have come to realize that this is Ok at best for those reasons. It is not the worse anime feature I have ever seen but it is by far not the best.the story revolves around a wandering swordsman who teams up fith a female ninja who can poison anyone just by having sex with them and a dirty old man to stop seven demons from conquering the world. Throughout the battles with the demons range in style as each has their own techniques. In the end they of course win but not without casulties.This is an OK entry and is highly respected because it was one of the first Anime titles to get mainstream attention (Next to Speed Racer and Akira). This is OK, but for Hardcore Anime fans only"
3,Fun...!,"I'm not familiar with the series, so I review this as a stand alone anime movie. It was a bit short, but full of action, maybe if you get to know the main caracter you could get attached to him and buy the series. Didn't worked for me, once I saw it the first time, I didn't watch it a second time. Only for the hardcore fan, I think..."
2,Its Ok.. but not stellar....,"Wow all the reviews so positive?... im truely disapointed at the lack of comments besides ""best anime of all time""... man.. sad.. i wouldn't rank it in the top ten.... lots of action.. easy to follow story line.. accually your smacked with it.. no indepth plot or character development.. if your looking for great action i'd take Bubble Gum Crisis DVD collectors suite... much better imho... ghost in the shell is good.. very slick battle with the tank...but macross plus is way better visual wise....... my review point there is no story... if your looking for bloody battle scenes......"
1,Poor Quality,This is some burned digital copy found on the internet that is also edited for content.
2,Overrated,"In my opinion this is not a great anime. People say it has a great plot. But in my opinion thats what this movie rushes the most. The action and the characters are good. But the main character fights every bad guy in such a short amount of time. The plot barely existed, it was just killing most of the time. How people consider this a good anime, let alone one of the best is completely beyond me. The sex and violence doesn't offend me it's just the lack of creativity and depth that turns me off to this.If you want a great anime involving samurai or ninja I reccomend Samurai X. Much better plot, action, and just about everything."
2,Poor Transition To Blu Ray,The transition to blu ray for this version of Ninja Scroll is very poor. It is not 16x9 and not in 1080p. The audio quality is also poor on this version of Ninja Scroll. I played my DVD version and the quality is better than this version. I would avoid purchasing this until a better version comes out.
4,Onward Ninja Demons,Pretty good plotline and story. It can be a tad confusing at times so you'll have to follow. It was a tad more gory than I originally expected but hey back in those times people weren't exactly clean in battle techniques. Any ways this would probably suit pretty well in a person's anime collection. So just consider this one but don't make it top prioty of video's on your wishlist.
3,"Great movie, no frills version on UMD","Although I love this movie and was very excited to see this available on UMD, I'm a little disappointed in the UMD version. I wouldn't pay more then $10 for the UMD version of this. Its basically just the movie and the quality isn't that great. Looks like someone copied the VHS version onto the UMD and didn't even bother to widescreen or up the resolution. You'd have been better buying the dvd, then ripping it. No extras either."
4,Good ninja movie,"There are a couple things I'd add to what I've seen here. I knocked off one star because of a couple flaws I noticed with the DVD version. First there was one part where Jubei comes in contact with a bad guy about half hour into the movie where the sound strangely goes muffled for about 5 seconds before going back to normal. For a DVD I cannot fathom for the life of me how that got through.As to the [explicit] scenes... it seems as though there were cut from the version of the movie that I was watching. I saw a VHS version which was much more explicit. I'd wonder if anyone else noticed it.Otherwise, good fights good animation, and good whuppings to be had in this movie."
5,great cartoon,"I don't watch much cartoon but theese is a great movie, regardless. Action packed. If I were you, I would watch this. We dun need no stinkin badges, we have swords. Watch this movie,regardless."
3,Review for Blu-Ray version released 12-4-12!,So the review is for the Blu-Ray. If your reading this you know this movie is a classic anime so I won't say much about that. It's still a great movie I'm happy to have on a Blu-Ray but.....and it's a big BUT for me. Only in 4x3 presentation which means not in widescreen so if you have a HDTV you'll be watching with vertical black bars on the sides. The visuals are improved over the DVD (I own that as well) but man I wish they could have updated to a true widescreen for 20 bucks I can't help but feel let down. Also no special features! So I rated this 3 stars not for the movie but the presentation. If you don't own this yet this is the best version out there but if you have it already on DVD only purchase if your a big fan.
4,Ancient Japanese demons and ninjas at its best,"This is one of the best Anime movies I have ever seen. Its not too picky on trying to make the animation the best in computer graphics or whatever, therefore focusing alot on the story. The story to this Anime is great, it keeps you interested and it never gets dull. The fight scenes start getting a little too rushed towards the end, but it continues to be the my third favorite anime movie of all time. (first being Akira and second being Death and Rebirth of Evangelion)"
4,"Excellent for action, okay for story line","I guess once you have seen so many movies and anime you get to realize that the artwork, story line and creativity don't get much better than Ninja Scroll. Although I believe that the ending could have been a little bit more creative, who can complain with an anime (let's not bring movies into this considering the fact that they are still horrible with creating a realistic fantasy with all of the graphical abilities they have) that delves into the fantastical by creating characters with powers that seem, in some respects, impossible and limited. I believe that this is a great beginning for anime and hope that others do not sit around too long getting a whiff of what people want and need."
5,This is one of the best all around movies in existence!,"Get this, even if it means getting nothing else"
1,Scroll is far from the best,"I thought that I was going to get a quality movie and a good action flick. But I was surprised and amazed(not in the good way either.) Don't let any child near this one!!First things first; way too much sex!! It seems like the whole plot is made up around sex. I could not stand to watch the female lead get herself raped almost every 20 minutes!! Also, the violence is pointless. One of the few things that I like is that the English voice actors didn't drive me nuts. And there is some depth when the main characters confront each other about their feelings. Every thing else is sex and violence. Oh yeah, did I mention plot? There is none. So if you like senseless violence and lots of sex then this is your movie. If not don't even try to watch it."
1,Urghh! Bad anime at its worst.,"I thought that I was going to get a good action flick. I was horribly mistaken though.First thisngs first; WAY to much sex! I could hardly watch as the main female lead got raped almost every 20 minutes. Thats not my idea of entertainment. There was a whole bunch of violence too. It seemed like the whole movie was revolvong around sex and violence. There is NO PLOT to this movie!! If you like loads of sex and senseless violence, this is your movie. If not, I'll advise you not to watch."
2,Sex and Violence,"And lots of it. I was kind of turned off. I'm new to anime films, and going off of Amazon listmania's I found this film as a top favorite of many. I don't really see why, there are far better one's out there. It seems there are many of these films that go out of their way to go ""over the top"" with graphic sex and extreme gore and violence. The rape scene of the main female character was particularly disturbing. In my opinion, the story really doesn't make up for it. By the time I figured out what this movie was even about I grew so disgusted with all of the character's I didn't really care who won.Wonderful artwork is this film's only redeeming quality. Not worth the experience, though."
3,Not much effort was put into this anime classic.,"Ninja Scroll is my flat out favorite Anime movie. I mean it tops Fist of The North Star and Vampire Hunter D (1985 and 2000). With that being said, I was disappointed in this Blu-ray release. Why was this released in standard form and not wide screen? There were no special features to this. Disc credits and Sentai trailers are not special features. On a positive note the sound was great and I did get it to fill my screen by changing my screen format. Hopefully somewhere down the road we will get the steel case special edition like in Europe. That one includes a special features disc and a book of art to commemorate the up coming 20 year anniversary. I still love this movie and always will."
3,I found this movie to be quite boring,"First off, one thing I'm dissappointed about, was the movie's un needed sex and pornography. They could have left that out and it would have been a much greater film. The story line was sort of boring, too, but I won't give away the details with my complaints. There are much better animes out there. Seriously."
4,Excellent Anime Action!!,"In this epic anime we follow the lone ninja Jubei as he tries to destroy the leader of an evil ninja group. The martial arts animation is incredible, the battles are spectacular. This film includess many classic anime themes... martial arts, demons, outrageous powers... and it remains fun throughout. It does get graphic at times (lots of killing, some nudity, sexual situations), so this is not at all for kids. But for the mature anime fan this is a must see!!!The only reason I gave 4 stars was because of the compression of the DVD. At times, you could easily see the gradients breaking up into separate colors, almost like stripes. It doesn't really take much away from the movie, but it was there nonetheless. Overall, this DVD is definitly worth seeing."
1,One of the best animes ever!! should be 5 STARS!,"One of my all time favorite animes ever made, animation is top notch, story is compelling, all around a MUST SEE!!!HOWEVER!!....the blu-ray's movie sound track and sound FX are messed up, the voices are fine, but the sound track sounds like your under water, very hollowed and slightly echoey, and most def distracting......I own the VHS and the sound is fine, so I imagine that it is a manufacturer mistake when mastering it to blu-ray, I am regretfully returning it and not getting a replacement as I feel the sound issue would be the same...BUMMER!!But catch the movie if you can!!"
5,"It Slices, It Dices","As a non-anime kinda guy, I never would have expected a movie like this to be so darn good. It's got an entirely different feel than other products of its genre - specifically, a great plot that doesn't require a strong Dungeons and Dragons background to understand.It's got some really strong thematic elements, such as:- A reluctant hero- A femme fetal- Seemingly impossible odds- A great finaleNinja Scroll's strength comes from a solid plot, great character dialog, strong character arcs (both leads) and clever directing. Unlike other movies of this genre, this film does not rely entirely on spectacular animation; in fact, there's a good chance you'll forget your even watching an animation at all.Still not convinced? Consider how popular ninjas have become. Buying another movie with the word ""Ninja"" in the title could make you more popular. Just a thought."
5,"Excellent, Top of the line anime","Everything about this movie is excellent. From, the story, characters and the animation. Jam packed with action. In my opinion this has the best anime style. Those who rated it poorly are idiots, i agree. The back of the dvd says its for a mature audience and says what kinda material is in it. This isnt no Pokemon or yugio. This movie has some sex and of course violence, and the leading female doesnt get raped every 20 minutes. Whoever said that is prolly some fat ugly lady jealous of a female Anime character. Of course there is gonna be violence its called Ninja Scroll, about a Ninja with a sword and of course he's gonna use that sword in the movie,Duh!Expect slicing of limbs and other parts. A good review should be based on the genre of the movie."
4,Good story and Great animation,The animation is excellent and the story is carried through very well.
5,A great anime!,"A very good movie. The English dubbing was very good (I usually prefer subtitles)I recommend this movie to any anime fan.Not for children, shows sexual situations and graphic violence."
5,an amazing anime for action fans,"Ninja Scroll is easily the best action anime currently available on dvd. If you are new to anime this is the disc to start with. Superb animation, a great dub, and above average storyline mix together in a movie that every animator at disney should be forced to study."
5,Better than Expected,"The DVD I received was in better condition than I ever expected!!! I bought it used, but it looked brand new. I had been looking for a copy for about a year because my fiance had been talking about how good the movie was. I tried 3 times to order it from Best Buy, but it was always back ordered. The last time they cancelled my order without notice. Very happy!! Great movie, and it arrived less than a week after I ordered it."
4,Ninja Scroll,"When I first saw Ninja Scroll, it was on digital cable. The animation was actually pretty good for its time. Anyways, this Manga is about a guy named Jubei. He meets this girl(whose name I forgot) and they team up.She is a ninja whose body is poisoned, therefore she can't have any sexual contact without killing somebody. Jubei is a ninja who appears to be a very excellent and determined fighter. Together, it seems like NOTHING can stop them.I would not reccomend this movie for anyone under 13, due to sex and violence. If you can get past that, this is a really excellent Manga. My favorite things about it were the characters, the plotline, and the animation."
5,High Testosterone Anime,"This anime is action packed with flying samurai, ninjas, demons,and creatures of the night. There's a simple story to follow with the right amount of drama and romance(almost none). This DVD is great for any Martial Arts or Anime fans."
5,Asome Movie Hotttt!,"I had first saw the preview of this movie when I was watching Street Fighter Alpha:The Movie and I really had no interest in it. Then when I was at band rehearsal 2 years later my friend told me about it. He told me to rent it and guarenteed I'd love it. I rented it and he was right! I then got it for X-Mas and showed it to a bunch of my friends and they loved it. this truly is an adult anime movie. Watch out for a rape scene, a scene that was really unneccessary,more unecessary scenes and alot of gore and language. In my opinion it should be rated R. I hope this was helpful."
5,Greatest of all time.....,This was by far one of the greatest Anime's ever produced. It's a must buy. It's the bench mark for all Anime movies. The characters are great and if your into Anime and sword play this is the DVD for you. I'm waiting for the next chapter.
5,NinjA Scroll be thy name,"This is a must have for any one who likes or know some one who likes anime. It has the ultimate protaganist, Jubei, who not only talks ... with the best of them, but deals out the craziest techniques in martial arts. The villians are also great, they are all different, all very cool, and all put up a hell of a fight. This movie is the definitive anime, don't get me wrong, Akira is pretty great, but it can't squash the replay value of this movie nor can it repress how classic this film is. >Peace"
4,Incredible movie flawed by gratuitous nudity,"There aren't many occations where anime movies combine action, violence, and drama that actually compliment each other without seeming ridiculous. Ninja Scroll is one such movie that successfully entertains with the story of Jubei Chan, a fierce ninja who must battle demons and find an antedote for a slow working poison working away at his insides. The film is full of gruesome scenes of violence and impressive visuals. It also contains much nudity that follows the graphic nature of the animation, but might otherwise be considered unnecessary. By the end of the movie, Jubei and his female counterpart have encountered many obstacles and have grown in character, but the development seems a little uneven. That and the nudity force me to give it a less than perfect rating."
5,A Timeless Masterpiece,"To summarize up Ninja Scroll in a few words, simply brilliant. This is one of the anime films that have gone down as one of the masterpieces that defines what anime is. Ninja Scroll has a wonderfully diverse cast of characters, a great storyline and knuckle-biting action. This is not as over-the-top as most anime films, but you can not call yourself a fan of Japanese animation unless you own this film."
5,The nobility of a Japanese hero,"If anyone has seen the Animatrix short titled ""Training Program"", they are likely to enjoy this movie. There is nothing like adventures in old world, feudal Japan. This anime has ikeable characters and a slew of some really great villains. Jubei, our wandering mercenary ninja, is the lead character role looking for a way in the world and some jobs to earn some money. He also, like most Japanese heroic characters, shows a sense of nobility, in that the one chance he has to save himself, he refuses for the sake of honoring a woman. (Id tell more but it deals with the plot). Only real problem is that it has nudity and some lude sexual scenes, but this isn't intended for review by children. I give it straight 5 stars for intense martial arts action, brilliantly smooth animation, and characters who, despite being slightly underdeveloped, are likeable. Good first anime for anyone who doesnt mind a little animated nudity."
5,got scroll?,"If you don't have this title your missing out on something. This is a definate must have for any anime collector. sure it seems like a long flick but it is well worth the viewing. Go ahead champ, go get cha one!"
5,Best Anime in Years!,"At first glance you'd think that this is a boring ninja movie that has some dumb plot...well, its not! When I first rented it I thought that it was one of the best anime in years!! Next to Akira,one of the best anime of all times, it strikes very close. Some adult themes, lots of action, and a high level of blood and guts. If you like an action packed movie with lots of twists and turns then brace yourselves with this kick ass movie. An ultimate ""buy"" movie....great animation!!!"
1,messed up,"me and my friend were renting a movie he thought he'd seen before and he picked the wrong one.second the movie didnt make a whole lotta sense either,and I understand its anime BUT COME ON!!!!!way too graphic,raited R man....more like NC-17.by the way im a guy,im almost 16,and strait.call me!"
1,Ninja Scroll - Sucks!,"This is one of the worst anime's I have ever seen. The characters and plot are terrible. The main 'samurai' seems to have no past besides that a while ago he killed a guy. Now he must go on this quest to finish him off again, for an asinine reason. He meets some small old guy, who poisons him. And he later counter-acts this poison with poison? WTF? The plot is asinine, the action is ridiculously stupid, and its ridden with unnecesary sex scences. I would reccomend to stay away from this, and if you already have bought it, burn it. If you've already seen it, cut your eyes out and destroy them. I would prefer many other anime's, like Ruroni Kenshin. Its just better."
3,Mehh....,"I don't want to piss the NS fans out there but I don't see how good this is? I mean I have to agree with one reviewer, this is one of the coolest animes but I didn't think it was a masterpiece.The story was alright but not big!The animation was great but not excellent.The action was great.Over all it was an alright Ninja flick. Though I think this film is a little overhyped.Also I have a problem of people saying ""OH THERES A RAPE SCENE! OH!Gimmi a freaking break its not like you see what going on! Even though you have the sence of whats going on it's still stupid how people make a big deal that you see like a 2 minute rape scene which you barley see anything but a nipple shot. Jeez.Now I must say the violence is over the top. Especially when one guy gets both his arms ripped right off. EEWWWW thats gotta hurt.Over all I thought this was an alright flick I guess.Check it out for yourself and give your opinion on it."
3,Hmmm...,"Despite the good reviews this movie has recieved, NinjaScroll is definitely not a recommended buy. Its action scenesare very well done, however they are held together by a veryweak storyline somewhat reminisent of the DragonBall series.Although (thankfully) not as long as the DB series, it is stillpacked with generally the same amount of action.I may sound double-sided, but it all depends on what theviewer wants from this movie. If it's a deep storyline, stayaway. However, if what you want is action, gore, and coollooking fight scenes, then this is for you. Definitely notrecommended for children."
2,"Overrated, if you ask me","I heard so many things about this being one of the best animes ever created, and I HAD to see it, and it was SO great. And I was warned against the sex and violence, neither of which I'm squeamish about--and I'm a HUGE anime fan, I rarely find an anime I dislike--but I really didn't enjoy Ninja Scroll. I was excpecting something great and found something mediocre. Yeah, it was okay to watch once, and I guess we all have to do it, but it's not something that I'll watch over and over and over again like Utena. In a word, it was dissapointing. The villans were creepy, yes, Jubei kicked butt, yes, but the yoda dude made it seem cliche, and I always dislike one dimensional villans. I dunno. It wasn't horrible, but I could direct you to lots better anime."
3,whers the box,"got the movie on time in good condition, but wher is the box, I would like to have the box"
5,great sound.,These guys have something very special. Run is my favorite. I can't wait until the full length album is released. Get on it guys!
1,Don't waste you're money,This cd player worked OK for a few months then started sounding choppy or not working at all. Sometimes it will work with only certain CD's and sometimes you can get it to work if you mess around with it for a few minutes. It is very frustrating and we are going to have to buy something else now.
1,Junk,"The CD player on mine stopped working less than two months after I purchased it new from a department store. Not just skipping, it stopped working entirely. I've had several other CD boomboxes from other companies, and, while they also weren't hallmarks of quality, at least held out longer than two months. Junk."
5,the rock says,i love this book i am 11 and if you think about it you rememberthis is not a perfesional writer so i think this is an awsum book forthe most electrifying man in sports history yeh go Rock !
4,A Gospel Singer who sounds like an Angel.,"I really started liking Tramaine Hawkins when she came out with that song ""Justified by Faith,"" but really became a fan when I saw her at Shirley Caesar's conference this past July. This CD features two of my all time favorite Tramaine Hawkins songs ""Changed"" and ""The Potters House."" She is truly anointed and has some powerful vocals. Forget all the R&B singers try Tramaine and she will sing right through you."
2,I felt like I was reading an outline about the book...,This is a good story... but it's not finished. I love Diana Palmer books because they are sweet yet .. fun. This book just skimmed over the top of their lifes. I didn't feel like I knew or liked either one of the main characters much less the supporting cast. This is a pass... read one of her older stories.
1,not good,"I would not recomend this book Midnight RiderI have read many Diana Palmer books and I find they are all bluring togetheryoung girl (poor ,plain ) hansome older man rich ex merc- lawyer."
3,Not as good as other Diana Palmer's books,"I thought it was a ""slow read"". Most of her books grab my interest and I have a hard time putting them down...not this one."
2,Don't buy it,"We have had success with Sony products - but this phone is a failure.The way it is configured you can easily hit the off button when you cradle it between face and shoulder.The digital Voicemail is poor, choppy and clipped sounding for both outgoing and incoming messages....and after a year and 4 months (take reviews from those who've owned less that a year with a grain of salt) it started dying on us...the battery is fine but it just keeps cutting out.We are pursuing it with Sony - but our expectations are very low, as the warranty is - you guessed it- just one year.Nice features which earns it 2 stars...if Sony didn't have such a good record - it would have gotten 1 star."
1,fvbp,"My Sony SPPA940 failed a year ago and they gave me a SPPA1050. I didn't install it for a year. A day later it failed. It would not connect to the line. It would beep when I pushed talk but nothing else. If I disconnected it for a period of time {overnight} it would work for about five minutes. I returned it and they sent me another. I don't use it that much, so I do not know when it failed. But yesterday it was doing the same as the other SPPA1050. I had it for one month. I never checked the recording capability or any other functions. An update, I got my third 1050 last week. After three days, my first time using it, it stopped transmitting my voice. I went to another phone to finish. When I picked up the 1050 it wouldn't connect to the line, only beeped. Then unknown to me it would turn the answering machine on. After loosing trust in it. I pulled the plug and Sony wants to send me a forth. Sony support has been good but the equipment or the repair of is very low."
1,Bad Choice,"This was a very bad choice. The phone would not hold a charge. I sent it back for a refund. I previously had the phone/answering machine and loved it. This phone was remanufactured, my first time with such a product. I will not try another one. Do not waste your time with such a product."
3,Successfully scratching,3 1/2Worthy if brief overview of Hebden's spazzy yet fluent chop-ups via a few artist remixes and sufficient track retooling will mainly appeal to the more rabid fans of Four Tet's earlier work.
5,Captures the great sound of traditional bluegrass,"This is a fine bluegrass album, with great solo and harmony vocals and high-level instrumental work."
4,Good product.,"The dishes work well with long eared dogs, just as described. Dogs take a little time to adjust to the depth."
5,Perfect for Spaniels,"Great design, finally a dish that keeps my pups ears dry. The picture makes the bowls look smaller than they are. They are very deep and hold more than you would think."
3,"Nice, but small","Its nicely constructed but over priced for the size of the bowls. I missed the 1qt tag, unless it was not in the description prior to when I purchased these.Side note: I have seen bowls twice this size at Ross/TJMaxx, that were stainless steel for half the price."
1,VERY deceptive title,"I am currently pregnant with my first child and trying to find games to play with my future baby as I don't feel very motherly. I truly expected 365 games. I, in the end, discovered that at least half of the book is advice, not games. While it's nice to get advice on parenting, I tend to rely on doctors and pediatricians for that, not on tips coming from across the US compiled in a book for games. I do not recommend this book if you are looking for games. For the very few provided, they really are things that even I, first-time mom without motherly feelings, knew. Also note that some games, despite the book description, are for 18+ months."
5,Blue Dog makes me laugh!,"After an extremely stressful day of running my own busy insurance agency, I was browsing through the aisles at Barnes & Noble when my eyes spotted a delightful book with a captivating blue dog on its cover. I sat down with the book and found myself smiling and laughing quietly as I read the entire book. Blue Dog totally captivated me, and the stress faded as I read the book and enjoyed the images. I've never before bought such a book, but felt I must have this one! I will take Blue Dog Man to my office so that I can turn to it when things seem to get just TOO serious. I wish I could thank the artist personally for giving me such joy!"
3,lovely,"i loved this book, especially the characterization of Alice. She's a woman who goes by omens, including what's carved by strangers' fingernails on a frozen package of chicken. Humphreys makes each of the three characters a star for one chapter, so you can really get inside their heads and receive information that the other characters don't know. It's about hope and despair and human relationships, the darkness of marriage and the light at the end of it. i like how Alice smokes just as it gets dark, when she feels the most despair."
1,What awful people,"I read constantly and seldom have I encountered a more repellent group of characters. I had to read the entire book for a book club (or I would have tossed it away after 50 pages), and found myself hoping for a plague, a nuclear holocaust, anything to remove such repulsive people. Vain, apathetic, stupid, cruel, selfish...it's difficult to care about a book when you despise ALMOST all of the characters. Even Iris had her moments of cruelty. I wonder why the author created them and hope they're not based on real people. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
2,Not Comprehensive,"The fundamental failing of this book is that the methods of restoration described in the text require a significant degree of skill to master (French Polishing, Hammer Veneering with hide glue, cabinet-making skills, et al) thus making the text exceedingly schizophrenic. The book assumes that the reader is a neophyte, but anyone who has already mastered the rudimentary skills needed to complete one of the projects given in the text would have no need to purchase the book, as they would now be self-reliant. For someone just starting out, a better learning resource is Brian Hingley's ""Ultimate Guide to Furniture Repair and Refinishing"" which gives step-by-step accounts of the process. Furthermore, the photographs of the completed projects are so poorly photographed (hidden in shadows, or a close-up shot) that one cannot ascertain if the restoration has been a success."
4,Good basic start,"You really can improve the look of your home (without spending a dime!) by following the basics in furniture and accessory arrangement presented here. The before and after photos look like they were shot in real homes - not designer showplaces. I'll also able to use the principles when I AM able to buy something new. This book may have prevented a costly mistake in selecting a major piece of new furniture. ""Use What You Have"" is definitely for the common masses though. Anyone with any type of design background experience would know these basic principles."
3,Not as Good As,"This book is helpful, but the pictures are in black and white and the rooms are only shown from one angle. I got a lot more help from reading Decor Secrets Revealed, which you can find by doing a search on the title at Google. The pics are in color and you can also see pictures that readers have sent in after reading the book, so you know the concepts work."
2,I do not like those black and white pictures,It might have been a better book if the pictures are colored. You just cannot imagine the look based on black and white pictures. You got to have color pictures for decoration books.
1,WAY TO SLEEZY,"THE GIRL DON'T HAVE A CLUE WHEN IT COMES TO DECORATING. SHE JUMPS TO PERSONAL OPINIONS ON ONE SUBJECT THEN SAYS, JUST USE WHAT YOU HAVE. WE COULD DO THAT WITHOUT HER HELP. AS FAR AS SHE IS CONCERNED EVERYTHING IS A DUST COLLECTOR. IT ALL ADDS UP TO, A REAL NICE CLASSIC DECORATING STYLE IS JUST TO MUCH TROUBLE. DESTINY"
4,now that I changed the hole room whats next,"I am a single man and had alot of stuff. When i moved into this house what do I do with it? A friend told me about this book and sat down and read it, it was great. BUT there was things that just didnt work (Fabrics) I needed to do something I went to joeanns fabric store and bought this book Fabrique Technique this was easy to read to.Between both of these, My new home was done love it,I did it all myself."
2,"Great premise, but where's the color?","Some great ideas, but one of the most important concepts in design is missing --- color! All of the photographs, except for those on the book jacket, are in black & white. It's truly disappointing. This book would be worthy of 4-5 stars if the photos were in color. Without it, at best it's a 2-star book.It will be the first book I return to Amazon.Don't bother to order this one -- wait until the publisher ""splurges"" on color photos."
1,Very Bad Indeed,"I really wanted to like this book, but unfortunately it was very disappointing. The ""After"" photographs all tend to look like waiting rooms and the photography within the book is quite amateurish, as was pointed out by other reviewers. And the author dictates far too many hard and fast ""rules"" to the reader without real regard to logic or personal taste. With few exceptions, the redone rooms lack life or personal style - most are rather sterile and uninviting. The main focus of the book is on living rooms, a technique which grows tedious quickly. Allover, a major disappointment."
3,"Good, But Not Great.","The pros: it has before and after shots showing different living rooms and how to arrange the furniture and pictures on the walls to make the room flow. it is an easy read and doesn't get boring half way through. The suggestions are easy to implement into your home. in the book, each room shows what has been re-arranged, taken out, bought, and borrowed from other rooms in the home.The cons: all the pictures are black and white, a few color pics would have been helpful for color ideas. it needs more pictures of the rooms instead of just one or two. as newlyweds we came from an apartment into our four bedroom home and we don't have the furniture to ""borrow"" from other rooms to complete the look. one of the reasons i bought this book is to learn how to decorate with what we have without having to buy a lot of new things. this book is good if you have an established home with more furniture."
5,Amazingly Quick & Easy Solutions For Real Homes,"When I sent my sister this book for her birthday she called to tell me that it was the first decorating book she had ever read that actually helped her figure out what to do with her house.(I was thrilled because she has read them all.) She insisted that I read it too, because I had never quite figured out what to do with my master bedroom and downstairs rooms. Four days later I received the paperback, read it in one sitting was truly amazed. When I started correcting the mistakes I had made (all ten!), my house actually began to look pretty terrific! Although the photos are black and white, I found that it made it easier for me to spot the mistakes. I really liked the fact that the homes are real homes like mine and not fantasy houses that are usually in decorating books. All I can say is that if I can do it, anyone can."
1,A very unattractive book,"This is a very unattractive book. The photos look more like bad snapshots of boring, cold rooms. Totally uninspiring. As a homeowner and a designer, I like the idea of working with what I already have, but many decorating books help me do that while also showing me beautiful yet believable photos of rooms. I am always tweaking what I already have, and my favorite decorating book remains The New Decorating Book. Another favorite is Flea Market Decorating."
3,A good start...,"But you can find better. Most of these rooms have a fireplace as focal point. Don't have a fireplace/ You'll find only parts of the book useful.Another BIG MINUS - the lack of color pictures. Color is an important design element and one bright chair can throw off an otherwise ""balanced"" room. Using color appropriately, whether to support a traditional design scheme or to inject an element of surprise or whimsy is a basic decorating principle.Finally, many of the rooms are already quite dated. Sure, you'll get a nicer look if you follow the tips in the book. What you WON'T get is a room that seems in style - today. If you're a traditionalist, that may not matter - but I found some of the traditional rooms seemed out of style too (were they faux traditonal or something?).Having said all this, there are some basic design principles that you may find quite useful. But you'll find the same ones - and more-in updated, more complete books."
2,This book seems a little amateurish. . .,"This book does help one view a home's design more objectively, however Laurie Ward does throw a few too many ""musts"" and other rules around. Her designs are indeed uncluttered and often reflect a marked improvement over the ""before"" photos. However, many of her ""after"" photos are lacking in real warmth and personality. I believe this book to be helpful to those who are just starting out and need rules-oriented ""hand holding,"" but would not recommend Use What You Have Decorating to those who wish their homes to be rich with texture, personality and comfort."
5,This book is the real deal!,"For those who say this book is boring and has too many rules, I would ask: if all the 10,000 books out there full of glossy photos and little explanation were all that helpful, why did you need to buy this book in the first place? Decorating is like any other creative profession; the foundation of the ""magic"" that a good decorator can provide actually consists of basic principles that can be learned by anyone. Oh, and I think the reason some of the photos appear dated is that we are used to seeing design books incorporating the latest trends. She used photos of real homes, which, I'm sure, contained furniture that the owners had been collecting for years. That's kind of the point of this book.I love the books full of glossy color photos of dream rooms, and I'll continue to look at those for inspiration and ideas. But THIS book has made my home look better NOW."
3,Helpful to others but not me,"This book is probably very helpful to people who really struggle with furniture placement and just where to start in decorating their home. Because I've had more experience in decorating my various apartments, houses, and condos over the years, this book was too elementary for me. For those just starting out, I think this book would be great. It is all text with a few black, grey and white drawings, NO photos - so if you're looking for colour and photos, skip this book. Otherwise, I think it's helpful to the beginning homeowner/renter just out of college/university or for those who just don't have the creativity to compose a room on their own"
1,A Huge Disappointment,"I found this book to be a huge disappointment and a complete waste of my money. It is a book that does nothing but gives you ideas about how to rearrange your furniture, which I think anyone who has any sense can figure out how to do without buying this book. I was hoping for a book that would teach me how to spruce up my old couch, give me ideas for painting old furniture, give me suggestions for slipcovers, something like what I get from the TV show ""Trading Spaces."" Instead, I got a lot of pictures of rooms that looked really ugly before the furniture was rearranged and looked only slightly less ugly afterwards."
3,"Hey, Not a Bad Book!","The before and after illustrations made me want to take this book home. I read most of the book in one evening, anxious to learn just how I could actually handle interior design with my hand-me-down couch and makeshift end tables in my tiny apartment. The best section dealt with creating a comfortable conversation area. Indeed, in the first few chapters I learned some new concepts I hadn't thought of, especially being a dabbler in art and design myself!The rest of the book seemed less elaborative. Near the end, some of her comments on accessories seemed a bit restrictive and elitist. Also, some of the black and white pictures were a little washed out and/or less than sharp. But note that using color photographs would have detracted from her message."
2,Home owner in Illinois,I only gave this book two stars because I did not find it helpful for how I live. I own a lot of decorating book and was looking for one with furniture arrangement in it. I have a room with two focal points in it and this did not address that very well. There were some good ideas for other rooms and this is why I gave it two points.
2,Very disappointing,"Unexciting graphics, a bit dictatorial, at the same time rather dull. This was one of the only times I've ever ordered from amazon without first seeing the book or having a trusted recommendation, and I won't do it again."
5,Have Furniture? You Need This Book!,"This book saves the day for anyone who has been moving their furniture around and has never been able to get it right. It shows common mistakes and how to fix them quickly. No need to buy lots of new things. Even after everything looks great, this book is so handy for reference. When questions crops up about lighting, displaying art or making new purchases, it has all the answers. Your copy will get dog-earred too!"
4,No more or less than the title claims,This is not a comprehensive guide to decorating but neither does it claim to be. The author promises to help you arrange your rooms in a more livable way. She delivers on this promise by sticking to a few core guidelines and hammering them home throughout the book in many different real world examples.How useful is this book? After reading her advice on bathrooms and spending less $50 on new acccessories our guest bath was transformed dramatically for the better. If you want advice on how to decorate from scratch there are many books better than this one. But if you want a practical guide to get the most out of what you already have then you will definitely want to try this book out.
2,I agree with the previous review,"The book isn't as broad in scope as I'd hoped, and I assumed it would have great photos, which it doesn't. Some good tips, but I'll take this book back to the store. Here's my recommendation: For Xmas I received The New Decorating Book, which gives me more help and also seems pretty focused on the way most of us decorate using the things we have-it is telling me how things go together, and it also has a realistic look and lots of big color pictures obviously taken in real homes."
4,Great how-to information,"This book does well in identifying the common mistakes people make in furniture placement, and gives real solutions that many other books lack. However, the lack of color bothered me, maybe because I'm such a visual person. If you liked this book, try ""Fabrique Technique"" a how-to on fabric corrdination. It has lots of color and examples of rooms, with a system of using 3 fabrics. Easy to understand like Ms. Ward's book."
3,Practical advice,"While this book did offer some practical advice, I was somewhat disappointed. The majority of the book focuses on the living room, and Ms. Ward does a good job of discussing typical mistakes people make with furniture placement and how to solve them. She does a great job of showing how to create comfortable conversation areas and attractive room arrangements. However, very little attention is paid to other rooms in the house. In addition, her ""rules"" are rather restrictive and in some cases just don't make sense (eg., only put books on bookshelves - never mix in photos or knick knacks! Or, no artwork in the bedroom!) Some of the redos seemed a little obvious(she madeover one dining room by actually putting the chairs around the table). The book could have benefited from some better photographs, possibly color (they are all b&w). Note: if you are looking for painting techniques or window treatments, this is not the book for you."
2,What a letdown.,"I was disappointed in this book from the start, but it wasn't until I got to this little gem regarding wall color that I knew I'd be carting it off to the second-hand store: ""For most people, white is the safest choice. It is neutral and will save you the anxiety of choosing from the hundreds of colors that are available."" Talk about condescending to your readers... blech.I suggest a more accurate subtitle -- something along the lines of ""Transform Your Home into the Blandest Possible Landscape Using Ten Rudimentary Design Principles.""Props to the author, though, for reducing clutter in nearly all ""Afters."""
2,Too elementary,You can save this book and buy a much better book. The pictures are all black and white........not much help in decorating. It seems a lot older than the year it was published. Ifound little if any good ideas in this book........glad I bought it used and cheap as it isn't worth much.
2,The book isn't as good as its title. A disappointment.,"Unfortunately, this book didn't live up to its promise. Some good information, but where are the color photos? It's kind of dated and dull looking. Photos have an amateurish quality. If I'd looked at it first in a bookstore, I'd never have bought it."
2,Pianos over TVs,"This is NOT a very realistic, real-life decorating book. The case studies were good, but only one or two of the presented cases showed where you can put a TV. About five or six showed where you can put a piano. Exactly whose apartments is the author writing this for? Clearly it's for people who has a piano in their living room and a separate TV room or something."
1,Best do-it-yourself decorating book,"This book is the most down-to-earth realistic book I have seen for the DIY person. The most important things individuals need to know, design principles are all included. The layout of the book with before and after picures and sidebars that list what is wrong and then what has been changed I consider to be priceless. Each chapter is easy to read. This book will always be at hand in my home.Thank you Lauri Ward for giving me the encouragement and know-how to get my home looking its best.Sylvia B."
2,Religious content = inappropriate for public school use,"This study guide to the excellent book by Joan Sandin has some constructive activities. However, overall the activities are fairly simplistic, and the references to scripture make much of the ""digging deeper"" activities inappropriate for use in public schools."
3,Ok for price,"I bought a couple of these a few years back. The quality is ok. They are very hard to fit on your ear. Sound pickup is just ok. If you need something in a rush, this might work, otherwise I would spend a little more money and get something with mute button that fits closer to your mouth."
5,A One of a Kind Romance Story,"This truly unique film goes deep inside the development of a man's true love for the woman of his dreams. What appears to be a fixation rooted from childhood feelings towards a hairdresser and the good-feeling they represent, is a unique love that spurs pure from the heart. In return, the recipient of this love is also a giver and the relationship these two people share is greater than any outsider can understand. A twist in the end of this picture forces one to analyze the true passion this couple had for each other. A refreshing unique expression of love is displayed here, which sets itself apart from the typical boy meets girl film. As most foriegn films dicate: God is in the Details. Watch closely and enjoy."
5,A quiet & intense snapshot of extreme loving,"He is a middle-aged French guy who has since childhood dreamt of being le mari d'une coiffeuse, the husband of a hairdresser. She is the beautiful, sexy coiffeuse who only cuts men's hair. They fall in love. They spend their days at the shop together in a private, surreal existence. They experience each other in exquisite detail. The unexpected, heart-wrenching ending will have you struggling to understand, quietly reflecting for a long while after."
4,a gem of a film,This 1990 gem is about a man who was obsessed with the local hairdresser as a little boy and when he grows up finally gets to act on that desire by wooing the new pretty young hairdresser in town. Director Patrice Leconte is a favorite of mine and this 1990 drama was the first of his that I saw -- Monsieur Hire and Girl On The Bridge would follow but this is the gem that first made an impression. Also just out is Leconte's The Perfume Of Yvonne ($29.95; Severin) which I'm looking forward to watching. Visit me at michaelgiltz dot com.
5,HOO-RAH.,"Really enjoyed this classic FPS. Hardcore gamers wont be disappointed. i highly recommend purchasing. Graphics are great, story-line is solid (and not so short) , audio is excellent and the price is right."
4,Great for crafts,"There are six sturdy little stencils in this book. The pages are easily detachable, and the designs are pre-cut. You can use them to put pictures on walls, windows, cards, or wherever. The pages are cardstock, reasonably protected against paints or markers. The animals presented are a zebra, a panther, a lion, an elephant, a giraffe, and a rhinoceros."
1,NOT Punchdown,"If you have a few weeks, and patience to strip all 8 leads of each Ethernet wire if you screw these all in, then these are PERFECT for your task! These are also perfect if you don't own, have a friend that owns, or can't afford to purchase a punch down tool.Took about 45 minutes to do the first one... of 16. Oh, and no connection. Waste. Unfortunately, I own a punchdown tool. These are a hassle at best.In addition, there's a random color scheme (or at least one that doesn't match that of Ethernet) of 8 solid colors, so you need to make sure you've memorized the WG/G/WO/B/WB/O/WBr/Br wiring pattern an put the wires in the correct order.I'm looking into how to return the others. Hopefully it won't be a hassle."
1,Not what I expected from Britannica,"This software is, in a nutshell, mediocre. It seems that not much thought was put into the program. I mean, come on...at least have full screen multimedia video clips..not cheesy little scenes that you could view on your cell phone screen.All in all, I'm definitely not impressed...as far as content, what I read so far seemed fine, it's just that the design and layout of the interface was very poorly configured."
4,Interesting ideas,While much has been proven to be fiction it is nonetheless interesting. Made me think about other realities than the ones I normally lock myself into. There is so much more than we see.
4,Interested in past lives and reincarnation...see this movie!,"This movie is a must-see if you are at all interested in past-life possibility and/or reincarnation. A jumping-off point for New-Age thinkers. This movie isn't just a story about MacLaine's journey but of anyone's journey to finding out ""why we're here"". Kudos to Shirley for having the guts to make this movie!!"
5,A must for those interested in getting into spiritual things,The video provides one a realistic and rational understanding of why one could get into the concept of reincarnation. The beauty of this video is that it is an expose of Shirley's personal experience and therefore not just a bunch of theory. It is easy to relate to. I see this video as the first step for many people to begin to expand their openess to new and rational thinking. A must see for personal development.
4,another vote to reissue,"Over the years this movie comes and goes in my head, and I would love to see it again. A DVD would be good, and streaming would be great too. Somebody, answer the call!"
4,Great for the Business not for the home office,"I have problems with paper clutter on my desk and was looking for a book to help declutter my desk and keep it organized. This book didn't help me, but would be great for the business office. I did pick up a couple of things to help though. Karen Kingston (Clear your Clutter with Feng Shui which is a great book) recommended this book. I was hoping Clear your desk was more for the personal office."
3,Easy to master,"Its not complicated. Completed it. Went to try online gaming, but there was no one playing. I loved the bolt flame gun because of its ability to zoom in."
4,Loved it,"I was, well younger, i had a job and a lot of expendable income so i would buy random new games that looked fun or interesting. I actually finished this game's story mode it was so fun. On the other hand i still have not yet to this day play the multiplayer which I only heard as 'Horrendous' if its like 5 bucks buy for the lolz i still have it in my collection."
4,Great Graphics but Somewhat Boring Game,"Somewhat confusing so uncertain what to write about this game. Purchased TimeShift after getting tired of playing Call of Duty 4 but can't say that it is a great alternative. The graphics are very good but since the character jumps right into the action, there's no story to pull you in. Very short review for this game since anymore would only be ""fluff"", not worth $60 IMHO.TimeShift developed by Saber Interactive and published by Sierra Entertainment"
5,Groundbreaking!,This game never really gets old. i usually play it and complete it once a month and it just stays fun.
1,substandard,"I was very excited to get this game but once i began playing i saw that it was ""cheap"". It felt like i was playing a computer game from 1999. Extremely disappointing, the graphics are OK but the whole game just seems plain. They should have spent more time working on it instead of rushing to release it, they had a great idea but messed it up in the end. The time control is probably the only thing that makes this game different from others but even the amount of time it lasts is very short. I'm glad I did not spend more that $15 on this game overall because it is definitely not worth it."
2,BIG LET DOWN,"Please save your time and most important money on this HORRIBLE GAME. The reason I was stuck into buying this game is because I confused this game with Time Splitters, I bought this game as soon as I noticed it in GameStop....big mistake the game is horriblely medicore. The online DID NOT WORK AT ALL. Save your money and just wait for Haze."
5,Best game I ever played,"Pros: Most advanced graphic system ever with heavily use of havok effects (water effects are gorgeous, deformations, explosions, particle systems etc), story is great - keeps you playing and playing and playing...Cons: Frame-rate gets choppy when you wouldn't expect (some will say it runs smooth, I'll say you'll notice the difference when it drops from 60fps to 25fps in the middle of action)I would recommend this to everyone, in fact I could safely say this is the best PS3 game I've played so far (this is the first PS3 game I finished as well)."
4,Challenging.,"Okay, why did I give it 4 stars? The game actually deserves 5, but the storyline video clips throughout the game make no sense at all. They're like 4 seconds long and they actually throw off the gameplay.Now, the good points. Graphics are great, and the enemie's AI (in Elite mode) is outstanding. You're not going to find the foes just standing around stupidly while you shoot them dead. They take cover, ambush you, and literally do anything they can to bring you down. If it wasn't for the time slowdown feature, it would be an impossible game to finish. Even with the slowdowns its kind of tricky, since they run out pretty quickly.The weapons are nice, specially the crossbow explosive, the bloodhound and the hell fire. Certain enemies will only be brought down with certain weapons, so you have to choose wisely.Overall, a worthy game to play.And a plus, you get to watch the foes blow up in pieces in slow mo, all the way to the ceiling."
3,Fragile,"I set these up in my living room wall and set a small phone inside the big square, it lasted a couple of days then fell apart. They looked really nice though."
2,"hmmm, not quite","the boxes were really small and flimsy. as to how to install them, directions not there. unfortunately, i had to send them back."
3,does what its meant to do,This helps tilt our seat back a little more for comfort for our little girl. Some cars it is too long to get to the anchor system but that was only 1 out of 4 vehicles we have put it in so far. :) easy to use!
5,A MUST FOR PREEMIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,My daughter was a preemie and we brought her home when she was about 6lbs. ALL of the infant carseats were WAY too upright and she was having respiratory issues. I found this wedge and she has been happy ever since. The NICU recommended it and said it was a neccesity for preemies.
1,No Good,"I was very disappointed in this product. I had high hopes only to find out that this did not work well in my Ford Explorer, it was too long to fit in any of the positions on the back seat. Definitely check the dimensions prior to purchasing this product."
1,Not recommended by professional,"I thought this was great - it did it's job. But I quickly stopped using it when the professional car seat inspector told me that they are not recommended. They prefer to use the pool noodles as they work better. Thus, save your money and have your local police inspect your seat. They should provide you with the pool noodles."
4,Better than a towel.,I purchased this leveler to use with my Graco infant car seat. It came in handy to keep my son's head from tilting forward. The 3 sides lets you choose which is the best elevation you need. I highly recommend this to those who are using a towel or anything else for elevating their car seat. This leaves indentions in the leveler and not your seat. It's a great way to protect your seat too. This is a great product.
1,Don't waste your money!,I second the idea of buying a water noodle and using it instead of spending money on this product. You can get them for about $1 at Walmart. Just cut it to fit your carseat width.
3,"Good idea, but...","I got this to use with our infant car seat, and was very pleased with the fact that it had three different heights that it could be ""set"" on. However, turns out, none of them worked for our car! When I had the carseat inspected to make sure that I had it in properly, I was handed one of those pool noodles to use instead. Unless you know that you are going to need the extra height, save yourself the money and use a pool noodle cut to length."
1,Go with the Noodle,"Although this is technically a good idea, it doesn't stay in place well...i needed something because my daughter was 8 weeks early, so i took it with me to the fire department to have my daughter's car seat installed and they told me to take it back...they used the pool noodle instead. Regardless of whether you purchase this item or not, i cannot stress enough the importance of having a car seat base installed correctly...go to the fire or police department...they'll get it right."
2,keep your money,"most of the time a swimming pool ""noodle"" will serve the same purpose and are available at almost any chain department store."
2,It's sort of okay...,"I bought this carseat leveler for both mine and my husband's car. It worked after much struggle to get the carseat base in properly, but we ended up taking it out. It kept sliding side to side and the material eventually started to flatten out over time. I know a lot of people like to use the pool noodles, but the material in those break down a lot quicker. I prefer to use rolled towels because they don't slide around as much."
2,May not work for everyone,"I had great hopes for this foam thing, but after using it for a couple of weeks, I returned it b/c it really didn't stay in place well. Additionally, it didn't look anything like the picture - perhaps mine was a reject that somehow got passed through. Lastly, the directions were not good. My carseat is a convertable carseat, but the pictoral directions only show how it is used if you have an infant carrier type carseat. I really wasn't sure that i was using it correctly b/c the directions were so poor. I have a 99 Voyager, and use the Alpha Omega car seat. A combonation of the van's seat, the bulkiness of the carseat, and having another child in an AO carseat next to it also made it challenging to manuver the foam thing in place to begin with."
1,Cheaper to use a swim noodle,We had our vehicle inspected on the placement of our car seat and they used a pool noodle. They cut it in half the size of this leveler and taped it all the way around with duck tape. We had already purchased this leveler and took it with us. He told us to return it because there was no need for it when a noodle works just as good.
1,Un fracaso,"Libro con hojas arrancadas, un atentado a la cultura. Me sentí defraudada, un hermoso libro mutilado, No entiendo como alguien puede hacer una cosa así."
5,Great Grill,"Love it, love it, love it. Easy to put together and works like a charm. Make sure you have plmber put in the appropraite gas line. The smoker box is great and it's so easy to use. Highly recommend this grill!"
5,Beautiful book. A must read for anyone interested in wood!,"Mostly theory and philosophy. Not a step by step guide. Krenov writes like a grandfather droning on about his life philosophy. Very enjoyable in a droll manner. It's hard to read this and forget about what he says. Here's a man who has utter conviction. His words still haunt me.If you want to read a book by someone who absolutely loves what he does and is, without a doubt, great (the best) at what he does, then read this book. Even nonwoodworkers will enjoy it."
5,Evocative read,"In depth character development warrant this novel 5 stars. Although there isn't a lot of action, it doesn't matter because the characters are so compelling. Gamble's beautiful prose draws you into the family and you feel like you are a fly on the wall in the big old summer cottage on the lake. I too grew up in northern Michigan and still spend my summers there, and the author captures the up north appeal completely. I've read a lot of books this summer, and this is one of the best."
4,Thank goodness for the family tree in the front!,"I really enjoyed this book, but I can't name a specific reason why. Part of it was the appeal of the family lake cabin and the memories I have of our family cabin, part of it was the characters and who knows what else.At times, I felt like I was reading a true story and I definitely developed a compassion for the characters.The only downside was that there were so many characters, that I had a hard time keeping them all straight. Thank goodness for the family tree, as I was constantly flipping back to it."
4,An exciting and adventurous book!,"This book is about a young girl named Nancy Drew. A girl from the 1930's and the daughter of a very highly respected lawyer. Nancy has a taste for adventure and usually finds it. In this book she finds adventure in an old mansion, and a man named Nathan Gombat. There are strange things going on at the Turnbill Mansion. Things are being stolen and there are noises coming from the walls. Nancy Drew meets the two Turnbill sisters who live in the mansion and decides to try and help them. The search for clues isn't going too well, until some new information about a man named Nathan Gombat gives Nancy an idea."
5,See review for The Bungalow Mystery,See review for The Bungalow Mystery - will continue purchasing the series for my granddaughter as long as she enjoys them.
3,"An Ok Book,i have read better.",All in all this book was ok.The only thing i didnt like is the book was predictable.I knew how it was going to end in the first chapter.This was the first Drew book i read.I almost decided not to read another. Secret of the Old Clock was alot better.Thats what i read after this one.So i say if your new to Drew than start at the beginning.
4,One Of The Best,"This, in my opinion, is the best Nancy Drew book in the series. It had everything you could possibly want in a mystery book except for one thing: the title of the book gives away the ending!"
4,Surprizingly Good,"This is one of my favorites, simply because I like books that have to do with secret passages, secret rooms or in this case, hidden staircases. This is the only Nancy Drew book that I ever really liked. In this book, Nancy finds a hidden stair case and unravels a surprizingly insteresting mystery. Most Nancy Drew mysteries are boring and the mysteries are too easy to figure out but not this one."
4,Nancy Drew Book 2: The Hidden Staircase,"Plot: Nancy is visiting her friend Helen's grandmother at her mansion, when strange happenings start to arrive. Also, there is a plot twist with Carson Drew. What I enjoyed with this story is how there are many plot twists as I said before. Having one of the main characters kidnapped was a real highlight!Characters: There are not that many suspects to count in this mystery, Nancy kinda just meets them, then says goodbye, we really don't get to know them and see what they're motives are.Action: There are plenty of twists and turns through out this adventure, I could never guess what was going to happen next.Ending: Without giving too many spoilers of the ending all I have to say is I was completely surprised of who the culprit was.Overall, this was a real highlight in the Nancy Drew Mystery Stories. I think Mildred W Benson did a wonderful job.Aubrey's Rating System (4/5)Thanks, and keep reading!"
4,A classic,"'The Hidden Staircase' is one of the classic Nancy Drew books. Hidden rooms and panels, a mysterious ""haunting"", saving a family from an impossible fate, and lots of frivolous fun in-between. The plot is simple, but interesting enough to keep a young reader (8-12) reading. It may not be as involving for a teenager or adult. It was my favorite as a child and still is for nostalgia. One of the best of the revised editions."
4,thought it would be better,looking at the cover of the book made me think it would be better.though alot of the times nancy drew books get better at the end i found that in the 50's through 100 it was better than the rest.i would say its worth buying cause it is a very suspenceful and well written story.
3,Condition of book misrepresented,"The book was in ""alright"" condition, but certainly not ""good"" (as indicated). It was what I'd call ""fair"". I'll keep the book anyway."
5,This story consists of a girl who solves a misterious case,"It should be a very nice review, with pictures. Each chapter should have a heading.The words used should be descent.At last, character of each person should be given.it should be just like a book.The summary should be given.Two-three paras. should be given about the author."
4,One of the better Nancy Drew mysteries...,"I read the 1930 version of this book. Although all the original Nancy Drew books are fairly well-written, this is one of the more interesting and exciting books of the series."
4,Nice little gift item,"I bought this little notebook for my mother who is an old school Nancy Drew fan and she was thrilled with it! It is a nice size to use as a purse notebook, well made binding, quality paper and there are printed illustrations on the pages - so it isn't just a blank book with a Nancy Drew cover - it is a total Nancy Drew themed blank book. Really nice small gift item."
2,Great tome on Macintosh programming lore,"I have owned several of Scott Knaster's books. He used to own the Macintosh programming domain in the late eighties. Sadly I got rid of my Mac OS programming books in the early 90's (never get rid of books) and bought it without realizing I had it once.This book has several interesting trivia tidbits, but it is 99% outdated. Some of the debugging techniques are useful only if you are still developing for Mac OS 9 and have access to MacsBug. While carbon apps in OS X may have similar restrictions/caveats, the memory representation and debugging techniques are useless because it just doesn't run that way.As Macintosh programming lore, the rating for this book would be 5 stars, get it if you care about Macintosh programming archeology."
3,its cool,i love the book holder but the price is the only thing that is not cool if it was cheaper i would have given it 5 stars
3,Doesn't fit well,"I was so dissapointed in this purchase. Yes, it is well made, and was not hard to install, but when I pull it down, I can only read the bottom half of the recipe! I have standard cabinets, so don't understand why they were not made to accomodate them. I paid the price because these are hard to find, but now wish I had passed on it, as it is useless to me."
5,No more sticky pages,Highly recommend this for busy cooks in a small kitchen. Especially for those of us who are needing reading glasses these days
4,Under Counter Cookbook Holder,"We used to have one of these under counter cookbook holders it somehow got lost during our kitchen remodel, so we bought another one. It works GREAT for both cookbooks and iPads. My only disappointment was the high price. Other than that, we love it!"
1,Garbage,This is a piece of garbage. When it arrived the screws that hold it together were ripped out of the holes. When I tried to tighten them they wouldn't. Don't waste your money.
3,Pretty. But average.,"Nothing too special pretty location and some nice footage, not enough to keep watching over and over again. At least the preachiness is minimal compared to some other IMAX films!If you have a 2011 or newer Samsung 3D TV. Go to the Smart Hub > 3D and check out the demos and full length documentaries like this one!"
5,Jaw Dropping 3D!,"This is one of the best 3d productions I've seen. I could only imagine what this must have looked like on a IMAX screen, but on my Samsung 3d tv I was amazed! Everything everyone who liked this film has said is true. Get it while Amazon has it for $11 bucks. I would have paid more it's that good. This is the perfect film to show off your new 3D tv to friends and family. I only wish it was longer. I could have easily watched another 20 minutes."
5,Amazing bluray,"I watched this blu ray on Panasonic 7000 3D projector 120 inches screen size, its simply amazing thruout, fantastic depth & beautiful scenery. This blu ray is a must own for all 3D display owners. I had earlier watched the normal version but after watching the 3D version I feel this is one of the best 3D bluray."
4,wish it was more vibrant in color and 3D needs to be done betterr,"I hated this DVD when watching on a 65' 3D TV as it gave me headache with the many scenes where there was too much parallax and many scenes have objects right in front of the screen giving you a squint eye and headache.I rewatched it on my 120"" 3D projection and this time these weird 3D scenes didnt bother me that much and i enjoyed the movie much better (although i still felt the strain). I am still giving it 4* because many other scenes were very well done and you fell like you are on the ocean ! I wish the colors were more vibrant like many of IMAX's movies."
5,"Great 3D, great filming, great science","OK, this Blu-Ray shows great 3D. Surfing photography has excellent traditions and techniques, and this movie uses them all. 3D cameras are placed underwater, at the surface of the waves, on the surfboards themselves, in helicopters, and in the faces of some beautiful women. The camerawork is top rate and the 3D production is as well. The material lends itself to 3D, as we are looking through the tubes of waves, down their crests, and through their glistening faces. The Blu-Ray also gives nice 3D graphic rendering of the science of volcanic island formation, and also of wave development, transmission, and breaking. Some of the most easily understood science, and made so by the advantage of 3D graphics.This Blu-Ray will look better on a bigger screen, so a 3D projector would be best."
2,"Good 3D, but a little boring.","This blu ray has some decent 3D, but I found myself falling asleep while watching it. I purchased it after reading that many people used it as a 3D showcase to their friends. I however, can't imagine watching it again. Not even for the 3D aspect. So unless your really into surfing, then this probably isn't for you."
4,4 Out Of 5 Amazing IMAX Ultimate Wave,"The Ultimate Wave Tahiti in 3D has few little let-downs ie. the film goes from 2D to 3D at the beginning of the movie (not too long though) and every now and then between shots, this is probably an issue with how the 3D formatting & encoding of this film were carried out, which is a general issue for those who are converting 2D into 3D; because so many of the low-cost 3D Blu-ray movies do have some flows. Also perhaps the introduction of the film and the actions of splashed waves could had been more dramatic in its 3D effects too. At least you can sit back and enjoy the other great 3D effects of the ocean, surfboarders & the two sexy sheilas. My ratings is 4 out of 5; so please purchase & keep this ""The Ultimate Wave Tahiti 3D"" in your collection; itis worth it."
2,The Ultimate Wave 3D,"Viewed on Sony 60NX810Okay (so-so), educational, some oomph, but where is the ultimate wave? Was a waste of Kelly Slater (world champion surfer?) as you would have expected the producers/directors to capture something dramatic/sensational. I have seen far better wave tunnel surfing on TV and in the movies, but certainly not here. Not much of Tahiti is captured, kinda gives a feeling of being a deserted place of untold beauty.Advice: Rent rather than buy, that way if you like it you can buy it."
5,Tres beau,Excellent tres beau rendu pour ceux qui n'ont pas la chance d'aller a TahitiUn enchantement pour les yeux un vrai bijou
5,"great tape, been there, recognize some old friends","wonderful video, very accurate, great for the surfer, good quality, recognize some old friends from way back, must have tahiti surf dvd"
4,Good 3D Effect...Beautiful Blu Ray,"The 3D is pretty good,a little short and slow but for the $$$ paid I found it well worth it..."
4,ok,the 3d is fine most of the time but nothing really speacial to me. the plot what not even that great but still enjoyable to see. nothing compared to deep sea in my opinion
1,This video sux!,"Bought this to check out my new 3D TV and cause I surf. However beware, THERE IS VIRTUALLY ZERO SURFING IN THIS FILM! What a ripoff!."
3,THE ULTIMATE WAVE,I ORDERED THIS ONE IN ERROR AND WAS INTENDING TO ORDER THE UNDERWATER MOVIETO VIEW MORE UNDERWATER SCENES OF LIFE UNDER THE OCEAN. (MY BAD)
4,worth the price,"I was suprised...I'm not hardly a surfer,just trying to enjoy the 3d effects,however 3 things i was impressed with.It had great color w/o 3d,the 3d was also pretty good to me,i almost felt like I was getting wet on some of the scenes where the water splashed toward the tv screen,and it was well priced. For a person just getting their feet wet on the 3d blue rays because of the reasonable price alone,its worth buying."
3,3D Good... Setting of Video GREAT,"I am not really sure why so many comments on the AVS Forums suggest buying this 3D video to experience 3D. While it is in a beautiful setting, and some really great surfing and underwater scenes it is just a jumble of events linked together. Kind of a travel video with little or no plot, but with good (not great) 3D. It is cheap enough so it does give you a quick and cheap idea on what 3D should look like, but don't expect a mega-million dollar video/movie production. The water/waves spilling out of the screen ""can"" really be cool, but it was overdone too many times for me. Would I buy this again after viewing it... probably yes. I have shown it several times to friends who are visiting as a quick example of what 3D can do, but I doubt if I will ever personally watch it a second time."
5,Simply Beautiful,"What a great film. It really shows the beauty of both the islands and 3d technology. Some of the most spectacular 3d I've seen yet, had to wipe the water from my eyes a few times. It really has a nice diverse selection of eye candy, from fire dancing to scuba diving on a reef to surfing, all fit nicely into the 3d format. The scientific part of the movie is also entertaining and informative, explaining the mechanics behind waves and how they form. If you are expecting a movie full of surfing and primarily focusing on that then don't watch this. It was partially put out by Tahiti's tourism industry, so it shows you many different things you can do in Tahiti. However it is done beautifully and really pulls you into the movie. It made me ready to hop on the next flight out to Tahiti and rent a bungalow over the water. And what's more for $15 and some of the BEST 3d I've seen I would say this is a must have 3d blu ray for anyone with a player."
4,Ultimate Wave Tahiti 3-D Blu-ray,Another great IMAX 3-D title. Absolutely loved by the kids for whom it was purchased. The 3-D was great and this is the closest one can get to surfing without actually doing it.
3,Great for a 3D Surfing Immersion Quicky,"Pretty good movie to feel immersed in the action. It's good for a short (45min) experience in detailed 3D. It's not really focused on Kelly's best surfing since it's more of a documentary style filming. It has a few quirky moments where somebody decided to try to ""take advantage"" of the 3D kitsch and made some silly animations that didn't really add to the film, in my opinion and it has some rather striking scenic shots as well... but my girlfriend and I were both finding ourselves asking when they would just get to the surfing finally. Nevertheless, it's a good flick I can wow my surfing aficionados with on my 3D set and not take 2.5 hours of their time to do it. It's worth what I paid for it."
3,Very Good,"Whether you like surfing or not this is a good documentary of the best surfer in the world doing his thing in Tahiti. Beautiful island with some of the largest waves in the world. Underwater scenes in 3D were good plus putting you in the ""tube"" of a huge breaking wave with the surfer.Family and friends enjoyed it and was a decent example of the 3D experience...one of the best so far."
4,Great movie!,"This was a grrat movie. All of ours loved it. Our kids are 2, 5, and 9. It made us feel like we were there on the beach with them. You cannot beat the price for a true 3D movie. I would definitely buy it again."
3,Not so good,"Not much to say, the whole film is about surfing and how waves created.Pros: Only 1 scene where waves crash and water splash into the screen I though it got on my glasses. Beside that the whole film look very sharp as color and sharpness.Cons: If you're not a surfer this will be 1 boring movie to sit in front for 20 minutes"
1,Boooring - Don't buy this just to try out your 3D setup,"What a waste of $15. I think I got fooled by all the other excellent reviews and my need to try out my new 3D setup. Don't make the mistake I made.This movie is a bunch of 3D scenes of surfing and little to no story. Not that I was expecting a lot, just something, please! To be fair, I have Avatar, Tangled and Tron so I guess you could say the bar was high."
2,Not A Surfing Video,"Recently purchased this BR disc to use with my new Toshiba 3D TV and Blu-ray player.Much of the film is a waste of time. I doubt that the people of Tahiti evented surfing or waves, but that does seem to be the main theme of this disc.The 3D surfing is very good, bu there is far too little of it. Other 3D is also good. If you like surfing and thought this might be interesting, you would be wrong. I would like someone to suggest another choice."
2,Dissapointed for 3D,Very Dissapointed in the 3d effects. Thought this would be a great movie...but I guess you get what you pay for.
2,Short,"I don't remember what I paid for it, but it was maybe 20 minutes or less & different than what I expected. :("
3,Good,"If you have any interest in surfing this one if for you. As far as the 3D part this one is good ,but won't blow you away.Keep in mind no special effects here. Just a very natural and realistic sample of IMAX 3D"
3,The Ultimate Wave Tahiti 3D,"The DVD itself was very well done and I found it to be very informative. However, having just purchased my 3D home theater, I was very disappointed in the 3D version of this presentation."
1,Did Not Work! Poor Amazon return Policy!,"Hello: We tried this 3D BluRay 4-30-12 and it did not work in 3D. (VIZIO XVT3D554SV 55-inch 1080p 480Hz 3D LED HDTV.) After many false starts the picture would finally appear. In all the available settings offered by the TV, The picture was blurred, double and triple vision. Unfortunatly Amazon.com's poor return policy means we lost what we paid for the movie. I don't immediatly watch DVD's as soon as I buy them. I would suggest purchasing DVD's locally ie... Costco, Sam's, Walmart,etc... so you can return them for your hard earned money, not Amazon's lofty stock price of $230.67. Thanks, J."
1,Not good,This was nothing what I was hoping for. I thought I would see alot of surfers perspective inside a wave. No.....It was alot of talking about waves and searching for a super wave and how waves are formed. thats it. don't buy it
2,Bad quality,"The first time viewing the movie was fine, but while trying to watch it the second time is was a disaster; it keep stopping and or shifting from one charter to another.The movie is not a bad thing to watch, just the quality of the copy was bad."
3,maybe for $5,"The only thing that made this movie bearable to watch was the 3D. Otherwise I wouldn't buy it if it was on sale at dollar tree. It's a nice little documentary to watch in 3D and fall asleep. Don't think it's worth $10, I definitely over payed."
3,"It's good 3D and surfers may like it, but guests find it boring","It's good 3D and quality picture. Surfers will like it, but my guests find it boring. Kinda sorry I bought it."
3,A nice trip to the Tahiti's,"A good movie to see the waves of Tahiti. I was a bit disappointed that there weren't more in your face/through the barrel action shots. I was also hoping for a bit more environmental message. This was the first 3-D movie we watched at home, so I can't yet compare it to other 3-D movies out there."
4,surfing at is best,i wish i was surfing it looks like magic very good on 3d and the picture is excellent well recommend it
4,Relaxful and Fun to watch...,"This 3D Dvd is really nice. For the price it cant be beat. The scenery is spectacular at best. The 3D is pretty cool. We enjoyed watching this on our new 51"" Samsung Plasma. This is a great inexpensive dvd to try on your new 3D tv. The family in this video showed so much love and appreciation for Tahiti's beauty. The camera action scenes were simply amazing. I would recomend this to all, especially to 1st time 3D TV owners."
1,Does not fit,"I bought this tool at a bike store. Before buying, I carefully checked the fit specifications on the Park Tool web site. On two different bikes with seemingly typical six notch bottom bracket lock rings that measure within the published specification range of the tool manufacturer, this tool does not fit well enough to allow me to put sufficient force on the lock ring to turn the lock ring and it tends to damage the lock ring because it does not fit properly. The bike store salesperson was careful to warn me that once the tool is out of the package, they do not give returns."
4,review,this item does it's job. i have had no issues using it to install or uninstall my lock ring.i would suggest going with a combo lock ring/ chain whip tool if you need both.
5,"lightweight, heavy duty","takes up little space in a tool box, but makes bottom bracket overhaul a piece of cake (with BB tool, of course). Much more satisfying than bringing your bike(s) to a mechanic, and cheaper.DIY or die!"
5,Exactly what I needed,I bought a 2012 Diamondback Outlook mountain bike and after about 50 miles I felt the cranks creaking a little bit left to right when I would pedal. I assumed the bottom bracket wasn't quite tight. A friend with a crank puller and some good wrenches took the bottom bracket completely apart and put it all back together for me. Apparently he didn't tighten the lock ring very tightly and it eventually came loose and I began experience the creaking again. I realized this was the exact same issue I had had in the first place as I could hand loosen the lock ring. I bought the Park Tool HCW-5 and it fit the lock ring perfectly. I was able to tighten the lock ring sufficiently that it no longer creaks and it shouldn't come loose again while I'm riding. 5 stars for a decently priced product that does exactly what it is supposed to without tearing up the metal like a pair of pliers would.
2,Not for Giant Boulder mountain bikes,"I bought this tool because a biking forum said is would fit the lockring on my bikes cassette. It does not. The large opening's teeth do not line up with the grooves and the single tooth cannot get a good angle and is too large to fit (without modification).I would normally give something like this a 3 star (neutral) rating because the tool is not at fault for my inability to use it, but in working with it I noticed a few flaws that make it a less useful tool. The most significant one is that the teeth all have heavy beveling, leaving lots of slip room for grooves that are not a perfect fit. The next is that the steel is not of good quality for something that might experience a lot of torque. It may be hard enough for whatever its intended application is, but I can't imagine needing a specialty wrench for something that doesn't need to be tight."
2,"OK, BUT....","Fits the locking ring on my Rans Stratus bottom bracket, but for some reason the teeth that engage the ring are tapered a bit making it hard to keep the wrench on the ring. It slipped several times because of those tapered teeth, making a nice scratch in my paint finish. Good quality overall, but design should have had blunt, squared teeth that stay engaged in the lockring. Park tools are usually flawless, this one disappointed me."
5,I NEED VOLUME 11 TO COMPLETE MY SET!,"This is a wonderful set of cookbooks, but I'm one short... Story of my life...Please contact me if you have a Volume 11 to sell.Thank you,John M. Adams"
4,dance-a-licious!,"If you became hooked on ""Toca's Miracle"" as much as I did, then this CD will not be a disappointment. It includes the aforementioned international dance chart topper, as well as their recent U.S. dance hits ""Everytime You Need Me"" and ""You Are Alive"". Worth the price of admission right there. I was pleasantly surprised to find more enjoyable material on this disc... a rare feat for club-based artists, in my book.Go ahead and pick this gem up... I think you'll walk away pleased. If not, you'll at least shake your groove thang for a few sweaty minutes. And I'll be right there with you."
2,Wow!,"I had no idea that Real McCoy just had a new CD out! Oh wait, the cheesy European guy isn't rapping over the dance beats. And the songs aren't as catchy as ""Another Night"", etc. I guess the first few tracks are okay, but it goes really downhill from there. And did it really need not one but 2 versions of ""Toca's Miracle"" which sound almost exactly the same?"
2,slippery soles,"my 9-month-old daughter is starting day care and needs shoes. she's a cruiser and starting to take steps with help. i thought these sneakers would provide some grip to keep her from slipping on the tile/linoleum floor but no luck. there are tiny little dots on the soles which would be fine on carpeting but unfortunately, they do nothing to keep her feet from sliding from under her on a smooth surface. adorable, but i'm sending these back."
5,super cute,"I purchased these shoes as a gift. They were definately different than the usual baby shower gift, and did elicit a lot of "" oh my gosh..how cute "" comments."
4,Stay on his feet,"Shoes are fairly easy to get on LO's feet, but the best part is that he can't take them off and the don't fall off his feet, so there is no worries of losing the shoes. I gave it 4 stars because I wish the bottoms had more grip. I just added hot glue stripes to it and it did the trick"
5,cool baby shoes!!,"I will be havign a baby in a few days, so I haven't actually been able to try them out yet. But they are so adorable and cool -- just like the pic. I plan on buying them in all sizes as she grows!!"
4,Nice Rides,"We really liked the shoes. They are just kind of hard to get on a 5 month old baby, considering how much she moves. (But, I guess that is only expected.)"
3,Baby loved these.,May run a size smaller than advertised. Looks great on your girl. Laces can be annoying since most shoes for this population come with velcro closure systems. Bottoms are cloth so don't wear them in the rain/snow. Thin layer of rubber or leather could improve this item. Invest in pediped shoes if you really want baby to be safe and comfortable. pediped Infant/Toddler Caroline Mary Jane
4,I so wanted these to work!,"Super cute, I mean who doesn't want a pair of high top chucks for their kids! Unfortunately, my little man has chubby ankles and wide feet. We wouldn't get these on his foot, let alone pull them up far enough over his ankle to get them to stay on."
5,YAY,"These reads are great, can't complain, best reeds, will buy more, don't know what else to write, great reeds though."
2,what the...?....,"if you love the man's voice regardless of his lyrics, then this is a 5 star achievement...but to me this album is lacking that special something that makes isley music so great. yeah, they have adult themes, but they just seem to be lacking the maturity level expected of romance and relationship music. try their BEAUTIFUL BALLADS CD or MISSION TO PLEASE; those are both great albums."
3,Hit&Miss,"Ronald Isley still has SOul.the Man is Bettere than 99% of what is out now on a So-So day.Ernie Isley still wails on the Axe.the Material here is ok for now but overall it's not like the The Golden Era Isley's ""3+3"" era stuff though.the Production here doesn't challenge the Isley's enough to the fullest.but the Talent of Ron&Ernie is still up to any task."
1,If It Ain't Broke - Don't Fix It!,"I was extremely disappointed with this CD - the Isleys are trying too hard to be something they're not - did you catch their attire on inside of the CD sleeve? A little long in the tooth to be dressing like a thug....The Isleys are great, but they need to stick to their own material - And Ronald - give up the Mr. Biggs act - that's tired...you're more talented than that!!!"
4,They Ron's still got it,I could do without the Mr. Bigs references...but Ron Isley's still got IT!!!
5,THIS IS THE ROMANCE CD OF THE YEAR!!,"THIS CD IS FANTASTIC! I BOUGHT THE CD BECAUSE I LOVE THE ISLEY'S...I HAD NO IDEA THAT THE CD WAS GOING TO BE THIS GOOD!!MY HUSBAND AND I PUT ON THE CD, DIMMED THE LIGHTS AND SLOW DANCED ALL NIGHT LONG! THE SOND ENTITLED ""ETERNAL"" IS FANTASTIC!THIS CD IS OLD SCHOOL ISLEY!!"
5,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.","Here is a example of what can happen if you have a successful formula and stick to it-your fans will love you and continue to support you. This CD is just as hot as MISSION TO PLEASE, and, for me, there isn't a dud in the package. There are a couple of songs, MOVE YOUR BODY & ERNIE'S JAM respectively, that will remind you of past Isley hits the way it's put together. From Angela Winbush, to R. Kelly, to Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, each song was tailor made with the Isley Brothers in mind, and they delivered. The slow jams will defintely put you in the mood, or will take you to that quiet place in your mind and leave you to relax and chill. Here is a classic in the making, and you won't be sorry."
3,PROBABLY COULD HAVE DONE BETTER!,"The Isley Brothers album ETERNAL is good, but was not filled with solid tracks. If you buy this CD, I suggest listening to ""Contagious"", ""Secret Lover"", ""You're All I Need"", and ""Warm Summer Night"". I first heard of the Isley Brothers in the early 90's, and I also realized that the Isley's has been around since the 60's."
4,Deserving of an extra 1/2 star,"Unfortunately, the ratings system here does not allow for the extra 1/2 star. This album is deserving of more than just four stars. The hit single ""Contagious"" is as close to operatic as any soul song could be. Even without the video, one can imagine this along the lines of anything composed by Verdi or any other classical great.Besides the aforementioned hit, The Isleys score on the following: ""Warm Summer Night,"" ""You're All I Need,"" a reworking of Chicago's ""If You Leave Me Now,"" ""Said Enough"" (featuring newcomer Jill Scott), ""Ernie's Jam"" and ""Think.""While not up to par with ""Mission to Please,"" ""Eternal"" still shows why the brothers have been an musical influence for over four decades."
5,Picture Time,"I got this polariad instant camera for Christmas. I absolutely love it. No more getting film developed. No more paying for development costs. Just take a picture and you have it. This way you know if you like the picture or not and can take another one. If you get it developed, you don't know until it's too late. It is also easy to use. My has a convenient handle on it too. It's to help you hold the camera while taking a picture."
5,"Perfect heroine, Perfect hero","I absolutely adored this book, mainly because of the strength of character that both her hero and heroine possessed. They were both incredibly strong individuals that were also strong enough to know that they needed each other. It was a true delight to read and, of course, I just had to read it in one sitting. It completely messed up my house cleaning plans for the evening--but was definitely worth it. So take a couple of hours off and pick this one up. I just can't wait till her next books come out."
4,Fiber finned throwback,"While not anything to write home about in its ""straight from the bag"" state, the Viking gets good marks from old-timers in the model rocketry hobby because with an extra length of tube and a homemade paper transition, the Viking becomes a ""clone"" of the legendary Centuri Vector V. As it is, it's a fun little flier capable of big air with small motors. 1/2A6's and A8's will allow it to attain respectable heights on small fields, while B6's and C6's will crank it almost out of sight. All in all, as good a place to start as any."
4,"My friend's Viking is awesome, but I built it wrong","This is a good Model rocket, even though mine didn't turn out the way it was supposed to. My friend and I were at an air museum where they sold rockets. We both decided to get this one. My friends one has turned out fine (unlike Mine) and it flies really well. The instructions are a little confusing, though.My mistake happened while I was puting in the engine block. It says put glue 1 1/2 inches into the body tube. That is where I put my engine block even though I was supposed to go further. If you buy this rocket, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,No finish work possible,"Easy enough build, all cardboard construction. The many different fin configurations is cool but the totally useless decal set was disappointing."
4,Quacker Fortune,"A charming, beautifully-acted tale of a simple, lower-class Irish man and his American graduate-student girlfriend. A most atypical role for Gene Wilder, and one that he handles with consummate skill."
3,Gene Wilder video,"I originally saw this movie in a theater back in the 70's. I had frequently thought of scenes from this movie over the years. When I saw this movie was available through Amazon, I bought the movie and got to enjoy Gene Wilder as an Irishman again."
3,Another GEne Wilder funny one.,"I had never heard of this movie until I saw it on Amazon advertised.I got it simply because Gene Wilder was in it. The movie itself is alighthearted comedy set in Ireland in a small village. Wilder's character, Quackser Fortune (the name GEne Wilder and a name likeQuackser is bound to be funny). Quackser wheels a wheelbarrow with abig rose sticking up in it, collecting horse manure. ""Horse Manurefor sale""-Horse dung for sale"" etc. Margot Kidder is a young richAmerican girl attending University there and is attracted to thisstrange character..and treats him rather shabbily as he is not of hersocial status. Then Quackser gets a horrifying shock-the village ishauling off all the horses to the slaughter house and without thehorse manure, Quackser has no job. By the way seems the village hasthe most beautiful flowers anywhere all over town and all just because of Quackser. It's not Wilder's best but anything he is in has thatquirky sense of humor we all love."
4,Fun old movie,This is a movie that I loved when it came out. It shows off Gene Wilder as a real actor in a love story as opposed to the buffoon that he generally played in Mel Brooks movies.It's an improbable love story that has a happy ending - but it is not the nauseating boy meets girl boy gets girl that most such movies rely on...
3,Quackser Fortune has a Cousin in the Bronx,Not one of Gene Wilders best movies.Not a bad story but with Wilder as star you expect more of a comedy that this movie doesn't have
5,Stands test of time,"Combat - Season 2, Mission 1It is said that ""Combat"" is the grandaddy of ""Band of Brothers"" and that it is. Although we now are used to more authentic equipment and more searing battle scenes, ""Combat"" will always be the inspiration of any well made WWII story. What gets me is that Vic Morrow was so underrated by Hollywood, his Sgt Saunders is a weary but determined leader and Vic Morrow fleshed out this character in a way that few could. What you will get with this series is good drama and action,well written and acted. This is a series that rather than glorifying war instead pays tribute to those who went through the ordeal of battle and is done so by talented actors,writers and directors."
5,All Time Favourite,"Although Enigma's first primogeniture was phenomenal, this time, a decade after, Amethystium's work, managed to shock me again. This Norwegian composer has produced some trully stunning music.Although the concept is not novel, the arrangements, the melodies, and the feelings are superior than any other New Age productions I have heard the last 5 years.Odonata: Powerful, inspiring, melodic, mood-elevating music on the first listeningIf I could find any flaws, I would mention the presence of some sample overload (especially the Commodore-64 synth samples)Anyway can wait any longer.. Looking forward for Aphelion and Evermind."
5,Beautiful and deep,"When I first heard Amethystium, I didn't realize he was a Norwegian like myself. I guess we have a growing community of ambient/new age artists in Norway, with Secret Garden and Amethystium leading the way. Amethystium's music is beautiful and full of magic without falling into the trap of becoming too nice and polished. The strong melodies and professional instrumentation is not the secret alone, but rather the rich details which you will discover little by little. Not everything is revealed by the first listen, but much is left to the listener to discover himself, and that is what makes ambient music - one of Amethystium's inspirational sources - so great!"
5,A most relaxing Musical Experience,"I came across Amathystium on MP3.com a couple of years ago and loved every song they had on there. Here they have put many of the MP3 songs onto CD for full fidelity. The songs are soleful with an Asian influence. This is an album that grows on you so that you can listen to it over and over without tiring of it.If you like New Age music you will love ""Odenata"".Steve"
3,Disappointed,"I heard the song ""Calantha"" on Sky.FM radio and found the CD that it is on and ordered it, only to find when the CD arrived, the song and title did not match what I heard on Sky.FM. Did Sky.FM mislabel the song on the internet radio, or whoever put the CD together didn't put the right song on it. I even researched the song and listened to a sample and it was on this CD. Very disappointed that I paid for a CD and it didn't have the song on it that I bought it for."
3,Only the wisp of memorable music,"Atmospheric electronica and at times Gregorian Chants are well produced and good sounding, but this CD just needed a little more in melodic themes to avoid being only the wisp of memorable music."
2,Too much sugar for my taste.,"Based on what I'd heard about this CD and it's (misleading) comparissons to Enigma, I was expecting a stronger, moodier, dramatic sound from this album. No such luck here. Amethystium not only lacks soul, it also lacks originality. The high pitched flutes and synthesizers heard throughout especially get annoying.Buy it if you like totally bright and optimistic, one-dimensional music. If you're looking for music with depth and contemplation, look elsewhere."
2,Eww.,"When Norway isn't producing church-burning death metal bands, it's putting out the exact opposite: bland hold music. Amethystium's Odanata is something I'd expect to hear while waiting for the next operator to come available. Listening to it is like listening to neutered Vangelis. If Enigma is too harsh and heavy for you, Amethystium should do the soporific trick. Stash this in a drawer with the Nyquil."
3,Amethystium - Not Close tro Enigma or Era,"I had great hopes for this CD and was disappointed after the first time listening to the CD. I gave it a second go and found the music not even on a par with Enigma, Era or even Delerium. Tracks 1 to 9 were bland and I felt that the music was lacklustre and boring. Tracks 11-12 and 13 were better and hence the three star rating.I don't think I will be listening to this CD again any time soon and if I can give it away I will."
5,Excellent!,"One of the best and new Artists in the New Age category. This album, as well as their second one,is amazing. If you like Enigma type music, you will surely love this Group. Two thumbs up. Can't wait for their 3rd album release."
3,Maybe...,"I posted a negative review about Odanata, however when i listened more the cd i realized that there is obvious talent in SOME, and i emphasize SOME songs. BUT, there is also obvious theft of music from many major new age bands like Delerium, Enigma, etc. I'd rate this cd for 5 stars if it werent for the unoriginality in the music.Overall, there is good music on this cd which any new age fan would like."
5,Coriolan by Guerlain,"Coriolan is definitely overlooked. Maybe because It's not aimed to wow you, it's not groundbreaking, it's not trendy or modern but let me tell you it is extremely solid. A dry woody chypre with a bittersweet character. Sharp and bitter in the opening with green citruses joined by juniper, various herbs and peppery hints, mossy/woody with leather refinements and subtle floral patterns in the outstanding drydown (which is the real point of strength of this composition). Patchouli and some vetiver reinforce the overall classic quality.Serious and classy. Yet another ""reliable"" fragrance by Guerlain."
1,Total waste of money,"I had so looked forward to receiving this as I was 16 when all this stuff was happening and dearly love all this music. This DVD is atrocious. Grainy black and white images of mostly lip synched performances, but the worst part is the sound. Terrible, like badly compressed AM radio sound. I have a good stereo rig and was not expecting audiophile quality, just hoping it would be close to CD quality. It is not. We could not even sit through the whole disc without skipping ahead hoping at least a couple songs would be worthwhile. They weren't. Don't be fooled by the 5.1 surround, it is just surround of the same terrible sound as the stereo channels. I cannot believe they released this, it is pure rip off."
5,Car Seat Grabber,I own this particular item. I bought it because my car has leather seats and my son's Century Breverra booster seat would not stay put. I have found it corrected the problem and is very useful. I recently bought another one for my newborns convertible car seat. It also help to keep the seats nice and clean.
2,"This is just an ""OK"" product","This seat cover is a great idea if it were only big enough! I doesn't cover enough of the seat to protect it. It in my opinion needs to go higher up on the seat. I would also caution parents about thinking that there car seat is in tight enough because of the grippers. make sure even when using this that your car seat moves no more that 1"" AT THE MOST in ANY direction! I would also recomend the Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite to all. It is a wonderful and easy to use product that will keep your car seat from budging even and inch!"
3,No that good.,"We bought this to put under my 4 year olds car seat. This mat does not stay put. It keeps sliding down. I bought a graco one to go under my 1 year olds car seat and it was much cheaper and works great. If I would have saved the packaging, I would have retuned this and get another graco one instead."
4,so so seat saver in PA,This product works Great with my 4yr olds new car seat!! I have leather in my van and its works with those marks it usally laeves! But.... with my 6 yr olds car seat which is the Alpha Omega Purchased back in 2000 this grabber is not high enough to protect the seat all the way up! my sugestion is to make it longer! but all in all its a great product for the cost!!
4,Does the job,We use this one in our that has cloth interior and it works well. I don't know what it would do with leather seats.
1,wrong color,"I have two of these and am looking for a third blue one to match the others. Amzon.com sent a tan one and they make it extremely difficult to attempt to return the item. There is no phone number on the receipt and when I tried the website, it says the system is currently down for routine maintenence. What a joke. Do not waste your time with this website. Save time and grab your children, get in the car and shop the conventional way."
4,Not as bad as everyone says !,"This changing table we did not have delivered we picked it up from a store location. The only semi problem was that the instructions were a little backwards , but once you get that figured out it is smooth sailing from there ... As far as another reviewer commenting on the pull out hamper drawer not being easy and requiring 2 hands to open, we do NOT have that problem at all ! Great find, Great price, and looks great !"
4,Galen Rowell... Adventure Photography,"This book is one of the great books on Galen Rowell and the inspiration that he has to give to both the adventurer and the photographer. I bought this as a Christmas gift. Though I ordered it very close to Christmas, I was assured that I would receive it in time. I was within the set time limit for getting it in time. However, I didn't get it until AFTER Christmas. It was a used item and I received it in good condition."
2,"Great book, terrible binding","The book is great. Rowell's essays are very informative, fun to read, and give a lot of insight into the world of adventure photography. However, the binding from Sierra Club Books is terrible. I'm halfway through the book and the glue came apart, leaving me with hundreds of loose pages. This is especially frustrating since I planned to use the book as a reference, frequently re-reading and looking up pertinent information."
2,"Great book, miserable binding!","This is a great book that must be enjoyed one page at a time. Literally. While the writing is wonderful, and the photography is breath taking, the physical construction of this book by Sierra Club Books is the worst I've ever seen. Immediately upon opening this book, the binding failed and the pages all separated from the cover and from each other. Perhaps the publisher felt it was best to enjoy this product in a loose-leaf format, or maybe they believe that glue contributes to global warming, and to use any in this product would have harmed the planet. I've never before owned a book that disintegrated immediately as this one did.If this book had held together I would have rated it five stars without question. However, due to the poor quality of construction by the publisher, I'd have to recommend you save your money."
2,a good tv movie....thats about it,"Take this movie as a movie that could play on TV and you wont be dissapointed. ive seen lots of earthquake movies..and some are really really bad, but this one...is not that bad."
3,tarry flynn's satiric novel,"Despite its disappointing ending and despite its flawed, episodic structure, Kavanagh's novel is enjoyable reading for someone who is looking for a prose equivalent of his poem ""The Great Hunger."" This comedy of country manners points its satiric barbs both inward at Tarry Flynn and outward at his family and his country neighbors. The novel makes of country life matter worth considering--as Kavanagh argues in his poem ""Epic""--and matter worth ridiculing. This ambivalence may be a flaw for one seeking unity of tone, but for me the ambivalence became charming ambiguity."
5,Wonderful book,This book is a creative way to develop and express a personal relationship with God. Highly recommended!
1,Dryest Read ever Written,Only read this book if you are forced to. Not a casual read. Author bounces around dates with wreckless abandon. Accuracy is highly questionable.
5,Fun learning tool for the whole family!,"My daughter and I enjoyed playing this game, and it gave me opportunities to explain some financial lessons to her that I hadn't thought of explaining. I would recommend that if your child is over 10 years old, that you probably just go ahead and invest in the adult version, as this one is a bit simple... My nearly 12 year old daughter had the ideas down pat within just a few times through."
3,Cash Flow for kids is for Winners!,"Great game - I highly recommend it - if you haven't bought the adult version yet - or if you want to teach your children about the Rich Dad concepts. It's easy to learn. Our family learned alot. A great way to put into practice and experience the concepts - hands on. We're using it to introduce us to the adult version, which will be our next purchase.The downside is that once you learn it and have played it a few times, it's not as challenging anymore - but that's the whole idea of learning...it leaves you wanting to go to the next level of education."
5,Very satisfied!,I am very happy I purchased this game! I wanted to start my child with as much financial knowledge that befits her age.Thank you.
4,Guide to saving money in the garden,"Book teaches basic skills to making the most of your money in the garden. Has a list of guides for buying the best tools which is handy. There are a few homemade pest control, fertilizer, fungicide and repellent recipes that may work. One chapter deals with the importance of good soil and how to amend it. One chapter I liked was how to recycle in the garden. It lists a lot of common recycle ideas and a few new ones. There are some pointers on the pros and cons of mail order plants and seeds. No photos are in this book and since I am a visual person that is a bit of a downside for me. An easy read and an inspiration to help a gardener create more in his own garden. Purchased at Amazon and it came promptly."
1,Battery Dead on Arrival,Battery shows up. I charge it up. Put it in the camera. Turn it on. Camera display reports battery almost completely depleted. The battery I was replacing didn't perform so poorly.
4,4-Plus Stars,"A wonderful, well-written inspirational anthology. ~Connie Ramsdell for Bookbug on the Web"
3,skimmer,does a great job. the half hook that hugs the top ring breaks over time...2 yrs. no replacement to be had...too bad.
4,Intex Pool Surface Skimmer,The item is just as described and works as stated. The item is a exact replacement for the item that broke.
5,Love it.,Love the flavor of the Wildberry in a smoothie. My son and I wish there was a sugar free version of it.
3,Not a bad toy,"Considering the Sigma 600mm mirror will run you over 4 times the price of this lens, its not a bad deal. I could not coax sharp images out of it though, but considering that it is a long lens at f8, that would be challenging with any long lens without autofocus.To get an idea of what this lens can do, search Flickr for ""Catadioptric"" or ""Mirror Reflex Lens"" for some comparison shots between this and the Sigma"
1,Yes Cheap but no quality,"I bought lens about a month ago and I was very disappointed, I thought the quality of the photos will be acceptable however when you take a shot you will get only white even when you try to manipulate the picture using software such as Photoshop it still does not work while taking pictures you have to have the ISO on high which makes it worse but if you use low-level ISO you'll get nothing, my advice to everybody do not buy such lens instead save money and buy good one because you will spend your $100 for nothing."
4,Baby Boomers Guide to long life,"The title of the book must be taken with a pinch of salt of course.The book's content deals actually with longevity not immortality, which modern science has not yet achieved.However, it is a most useful and informative work by Dr. Grossman and will no doubt improve the quality of life of all elderly citizens, who read it."
2,Not Happy!!,I bought these light they are ok but I did not get what I paid for...They did refund me a few dollars but that was not the point....And they are way to expensive forwhat they are...Would not buy again to pricey......was not Happy at all...Would not buy again....
3,Not for novices,"I agree with the first reviewer in most respects. The book is an awesome resource on how to make solid laminates. However, it could be greatly improved if the author would give more details on how to make the jig. There are good pictures and sketchy details but no measurements or helpful details. This book is definitely for the experienced woodworker. A little experience is good, but expect to struggle. Of course, that's what some of us like about woodworking -- the struggle, then the beautiful finished product when we're done."
3,What's in Fox's Sack?,"Paul Galdone was on my entering Kindergartener's Summer Reading List and we can certainly understand why. Even in this tale that is not our favorite, we can enjoy his amusing drawings.In the story Fox counts on curiosity to further his greedy aims. He visits four women in a row and each time none of the women can keep their promise to not look in the bag. The last woman at least has a reason to open the bag: there is a little boy inside!Fox gets his comeuppance when the last lady replaces the boy with her fierce bulldog.I thought that perhaps the image of the boy in the sack would upset my children (3 and 5; boy and girl) but they were unmoved and unconcerned.Three to four stars. The artwork is classic Galdone. The tale is a classic too. The rating difference stems from differences of opinion about the actual story."
5,Really great review book!,"I bought this right before the first time I took the SAT IIs. I only studied up to the Civil War and I got 650. I know it's not the best score ever but just from studying that much of the test material proves to me how much this book can do. It is also very easy to read, it might be thick when you look at it and the words might be small, but the language used in here is so casual and teenager friendly. I honestly love this book and please don't get the Barron's one! That one really sucks! The good thing about this one is that it actually tells you what you should remember and what you don't really need to memorize. It tells you exactly what will be on the test, unlike Barron that just throws you all the information. Seriously, get this book!!!!"
4,My 16 year old son is actually reading this!!!,"My 11th grader was failing 'American History' and I was beside myself trying to figure a way to get him to read and understand the subject. I had to explain to him that the title was not a personal affront to his intelligence but a style of writing that might make it easier to understand.He seemed to understand and got right to work with a highlighter. I was and am still amazed. This is a young man who lives to play video games and would do anything not to have to read.I'd recommend this title to others, young and old."
2,Much better products out there,"I got this product after using BSN No-Explode only because someone who had never used it wanted me to get it, to try it out. I have to say there is no reason to buy this product. For me it loses badly on three areas. It doesnt dissolve in water. It gets all clumpy and nasty. This not only makes mixing it more difficult, the effects take longer to kick in. (The BSN disolves almost like alka-seltzer). Taste is awful I got the rasberry lemonade. Some people say taste isnt important but if you have to drink the stuff almost everyday and they can taste good why not? The BSN orange taste great and I dont even like orange drinks. Now most important is the pump which again fails for me. The BSN came faster, stronger and lasted for the workout. Great Pump. I called Gaspari and while they were nice and helpful they would not guarantee the product so now I am stuck with it. My advice Buy BSN NO-Explode"
2,Works the first time.,"When I recieved the product, it was half empty and I wish these companies can fill the jugs to the top with their product. First time I tried it I really noticed the effects. I couldn't wait to get to the gym (energy), I knew what I wanted to do and how I was going to do it (focus) and I was a bit jittery while headed to the gym (first time user side effect. After the first time, I hardly felt the superpump there and I had increased the doseage from one scoop to 2. Perhaps my body already got used to it. This is my first and last jug."
2,Too much time to arrive,"I have no idea about the product, was expecting it at a promised date, and it took too much time to arrive, after emails to Amazon, and to the external supplier...one looses the desire to use it if it does not arrive in the time one has planned to start the whole diet and supplement routine."
1,HEEEEEEEEEEEY,"What is going on here!! I just took 2 scoops and I'm falling asleep. I know people develop a tolerance, but this is ridiculous. I'm wondering if there is any trace of superpump I used to take in this product I got. Is this a new formula or did somebody sell me trash? Remember the stomach problems? Nope, not there any more. Not that I miss them, but to me it is just an additional proof that something major has changed I just don't know what it is. I will not buy this product again, beware of the seller!!!"
1,worst creatine for your health,you are right.this product is worst i took it 3 times and i couldnt sleep till 4 am always going to bathroom upset stomach taste so bad.
5,one of the best,"have tried all of the preworkout supplements and this one is the best. be sure to take before 4pm if you want to have a decent night's sleep. noticed big results after first cycle, but mostly maintained after continued use. i've taken jack3d, noxplode and Superpump- I like Superpump best."
2,Not much pump in SuperPump,"When taking Superpump, I do not feel much pump o r extra energy when lifting. I have only been on it for about two week now, and I take about a scoop and a half or two scoops every time I work out. Maybe it is helping, but I can't tell. I would recommend Jackd anyday."
3,not really sure,so far Ive taking it 3 days and so far im disappointed. the first time i used JACK3D its made me go crazy i lifted all day and had so much energy with no ill effects but with super pump all Ive gotten is 7 trips to the toilet and and odd feeling in my stomach. i really wish it would work as i am very poor being laid off and going back to school ive heard great reviews from other people but not for me.. ive tried it on and empty stomach and after ive eaton nothing is workin ive used 1 scoop 2 scoop and 3 scoop.. well if nothing else ive lost alot of weight by pooping..its not explosive its just frequent trips to the toilet..
5,SP250 takes the cake!,"This has always been my favorite supplement. I still do like to try other kinds, but everytime I go back to SP I'm very happy. I've tried about 25 NOs & I always miss SP. Who knows how much is mental, but SP gives me the fullness feeling in the muscles not so much vascularity. The intensity is #1 as are pumps & great workouts."
4,super pump side effects,"ive notice while on it i get wired, the workouts are awesome, it keeps me going and i can feel the muscle tear. but after the workout im still wired and jittery, shake alot like im overdosed on caffine. and ive been taking it for a yr now and it has the same effect. i can fall asleep on it but i wake up in the middle of night and cant back to sleep. other than that i love the stuff"
4,I pumped my self up,"1st day I took it I was super excited and gave myself a fake hyper energy boost, this thing did nothing for meall it did was make my tongue blue and take SUPER sweet from the artificial sweeternot worth the moneyI call it, first-lastfirst time I bought this, last time I'll ever do it again"
2,whatever,"When I first took this product for the first week or so, I thought it was just awesome! I am 36 and . . . man. . . Your body get's used to the stimulants. . so you have to take two or three scoops to get the same effect as you did the first few times you took it. That is when I honestly felt my hearing begin to diminish. . my heart hurt. . . That much stimulant is like going to a concert where the music is turned up way too high. Even if you think it's NOT effecting you. . over time it will in a very real and bad way. My suggestion: IF you take it, take one scoop. If your body get's used to it. . . stop taking it for awhile. Use it only on days you are burned out or tired. But, I coudln't do it. If I had the jug, I would take it no matter what. It was just such a rush. So, I have to sadly stay away from it. Good luck to you guys. It's not a bad product. You just have to use some wisdom with it. I seem to have NONE. Chow."
5,Great~!!,Gives you great energy and you get really great pumps! as for the having to go to the bathroom side effect I didn't get any of that. Used it 6 times now and very happy about the buy.
5,"AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!",Personally I think this is hands down the best nitric oxide product on the market. I have been using it now for three full tubs and love the results. I get hard pumps everytime with absolutely no side effects! It may take your body a week or two to get used to the magnesium but even with the liquid diarhea its soooo worth it! I workout everyday somedays twice a day and never get the achey sore feeling while using this! Works amazing for your sex drive too! Not only your arms get hard and pumped up... Well done Gaspari Nutrition! You have made me a lifelong buyer of this product.
5,Super Pump 250 ! There is no Alternative !,This is the second time I've tried Gaspari and i have to say its the best NO product on the market right now.I used it the first on it's own and had good results by breaking a couple of plateaus especially on my leg workouts.I followed the label and started by using one scoop 30 mins before a workout. Eventfully i moved on to two scoops. BUT NOT AFTER 6:00pm as i couldn't sleep.Good Product and highly recommended!
5,The ORIGINAL Angry BIRDS!!,"A Great CD of Classic British Blues/Rock, FEATURING: Ron Wood (of the Rolling Stones & Faces) in his first band!"
2,"Thanks, Mick and Keith!","I took a flyer on this CD because it was cheap, and I was curious to see what the hype over this obscure group was all about. Well, it turns out that Ron Wood's first group was just one more of the thousands of utterly mediocre R&B combos gigging around London in the mid-60's. Forgettable originals mixed with a couple of uninspired covers to produce a resounding yawn. This group may have been able to deliver the goods live, but their recorded output will be of no interest to anyone but the most dedicated 60's obscurist. The Rolling Stones must not have heard this stuff before they hired Woody in 1976...."
2,Excedingly Technical,"This book contains all of the obscure factoids that you are more likely to find on History IQ than on the AP Euro exam. I regret every penny spent on it. It is a poor excuse for European history as compared with my textbooks: RR Palmer and Joel Colton's a History of the Modern World or John Merriman's A History of Modern Europe. It belittles many important social trends, while stressing minutia such as the Colloquy of Marburg or the Sacaardi Law. The tests are poor indicators of actual test performance; I got 45-50/80 on their tests and 75/80 on the book published by College board. Buy it only for DBQ practice."
4,Who Knew????,"Years ago I worked in the Cosmetic industry; specifically for Germaine Monteil ~ when I originally purchased this fragrance. At that time and ever sense, no matter when I wear this people comment on how soft and lovely it smells. Frankly, I thought that after having this in it's original bottle all these years It might have gone bad. I am now at the end of the original bottle and decided to look on line to see if I could find it again.Much to my surprise; this fragrance is identical to the original item purchased. In fact, the bottom of both bottles, say Five Star Fragrance.Who Knew????"
2,I long for the good old days,"Wow, I got this product and I was shocked at how strong it is. I used Royal Secret many years ago, and it was a wonderfully subdued scent reminding me somewhat of baby powder. I loved it! It is NOT the SAME! I barely put any on now and I will not buy this again."
5,No issues at all ...,"and runs fast . Would buy again if needed for any future installs . I purchased this and a 75 foot of the same brand , and no regrets . Especially if you go price the same cables at BB , so it's no wonder they are on 'the brink' ."
4,Extraordinary Relationships,"Excellent info and insight into how we relate to each other. Based on Bowen's theory, the author does a good job of revisiting this info. Not a flowing, easy read though. Several paragraphs or phrases required a second pass due to the way they were written. However, there is valuable info/insight to be gleaned from this book and worth treading slowly (or repeating) some passages."
4,Great intro to Bowen Family Systems Theory,As a minister who has studied Edwin Friedman's application of Family Systems Theory to congregations I found this book very helpful. Friedman's work builds on Murray Bowen's foundations. Gilbert is one of Bowen's leading disciples and presents a straight-forward overview of the core principles of Bowen's work.
3,"Good, simple overview of Bowen's theory","I read this book while studying family psychology. I had never read about or learned about Bowen/Family Systems theory before and I now have a very good understanding of its underlying premises. Written in very easy-to-understand and accessible language, this book is great for people entirely new to the theory. In sections covering changing patterns in relationships, I thought there was an unnecessarily long emphasis and focus on biofeedback therapy, where there could have been more information given about other ways of approaching pattern change (the book does mention other methods)."
4,Extraordinary relationships,Was in great shape when arrived. I love Roberta Gilbert so it was just what I expected - I am studying Bowen Family Therapy so it fits in well as part of my reading
3,Relationships can survive,"Gilbert presents us with a systems approach with supporting anecdotes. She takes us beyond shame. This reminded me of how Elise works through her anger in the novel Defenders of the Holy Grail, but of course that is fiction. However, Gilbert tries to give us tools. The key is will both you and your partner try to do this? That is the key."
5,"Valuable information, but a lot of 'cut and paste'","Starts out with an interesting history of how and why the VA was formed, but then slides down into partisan politics that were totally unnecessary. The politics quickly became confusing and distracting.I think this book contains very important information for all disabled veterans. My main criticism of it is that I kept reading the same words (verbatim) that I had read in previous chapters. For some reason, maybe to swell the page count, Roche does this throughout the book.A good informative book, which is why I give it 5-stars, but it probably could have easily fit onto 150 pages."
5,Good Information,Very good information. This book was very useful in understanding the VA and their process.
5,Survival Guide,"This book is worth it's weight in gold and then some. It is written in plain language, so it is easy to understand, and it addresses all of the areas we (veterans) need to negotiate the maze of government bureaucracy. I highly recommend it."
5,Must have for attorneys and agents!,"I am an attorney, and veteran, who recently began assisting veterans with their VA claims. The ""insider information"" on the workings of the VA is invaluable, as is the advice on developing a proper claim and how to answer on appeal. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about the VA benefits process, and anyone who wants to help veterans file their claims."
4,"Simple, direct and to the point","This is a good book for veterans with relatively simple claims. It is still advisable for every veteran to get the services of the best Service Officer (DAV, VFW, VVA, etc.) that they can find to facilitate their claim, as, by law, it is the responsibility of the veteran to prove the circumstances of their claim, not the VA's responsibility. Some claims can be very complicated, and this book is not meant for those types of claims."
1,Do Not Buy,No worth the price.Pass on this one at any price.Information not current and a lack of general information.
3,Serves It's purpose,"Required reading for an English class that I have studied beyond for. If you can get a new one, just pick up a used one"
5,absurdity meets practicality,"My reaction to this literary behemoth is that of complete intoxication. It comes off like a joke, reminiscent of that Pepsi points/fighter jet debacle; this is an instant library. Imagine 700 pounds worth of the world's knowledge being delivered to your home, it is overwhelming. The masterworks of literature forever at your fingertips, it is phenominal.And to interject a few problems with the advertising for this endeavor...1)800 feet high? only if you stand them top-to-bottom not cover-to-cover, nice try but lame; 2)Where is William Faulkner, because i know ten of the best works of literature are not ""portable""; 3)Why would Penguin admit to having this list ever-""changing"", wouldn't always expanding work better? To admit that you remove items from this list is announcing that our opinions do not have as much basis as we wished they did. But, this is still an awesome compilation."
1,Overpriced,"Most Penguin Classics titles are available in cheaper bookshops for about a dollar and a half each. Why would I want to pay nearly ten times more per book when bulk buying? At a tenth of the price this would be worthwhile. Reading a book a week would set you up for the next twenty years, but at this price it's a profiteering gimmick."
3,A lofty goal,"I wouldn't say this is a definitive list because several titles that should be on here are missing due to copyright issues. In addition, I am disappointed by the lack of contemporary authors. But, this is a definite start to a great collection.I just counted and I have already read 35 titles out of the 1000. There are others I have read but do not remember, so I won't count them.In my quest to read more, I plan to read all of these.. will I complete the task? Time will tell, my fellow readers."
2,Expensive,"How many of these works are in the public domain? What if you exclude the cover art?With that in mind, it seems quite overpriced."
5,"Excellent!,,,",the music was everything that I wanted. Would order again because the service was quick and very satisfactory. Looking to order more
5,Hang on to your sides-Mighty funny stuff!,"Even those unfamiliar with boxing or the topical events of the time cannot help but roar at most of the humor in this as the former Mr. Clay delivers a series of hilarious rhymes about his modesty (or lack thereof) and likelihood of beating then-champ Sonny Liston. Ali would have made a great comedian. The added bonues is that he's just as funny when he tries to sing. His attempt to sing Ben E. King's ""Stand By Me"" straight with his incredibly hoarse voice and poor timing is hilarious! Ditto for his Beatle-esque, raucous version of ""The Gang's All Here"" celebrating his victory over Sonny Liston (check out the Paul McCartney-like WHOOOO! in the backgound on this one).This one will have Ali fans rolling on the floor in laughter. Those who are not in the know may also find this amusing. Enjoy!"
3,He is the greatest.,"This spoken word album was recorded by Cassius Clay before he became Muhammad Ali, and even before he became World Heavyweight Champion. It's pretty entertaining stuff, with Clay reading poetry and bragging about how great he is. The album was recorded in front of a live audience, and their laughter and applause definitely helps out with the atmosphere. The CD includes three bonus tracks tracks. The single version of ""I am the Greatest"" is shorter than the album version, plus it is set to music. ""Stand By Me"" is Clay's legendaryGolden Throatsversion of the Ben E. King's classic. ""The Gang's All Here"" is a previously unreleased recording of Clay leading a sing-along. Fans of Muhammad Ali should really enjoy this CD."
3,Didn't taste like a dark roast,"I was very disappointed. This coffee did not taste like a dark roast. It was not full bodied.If you are looking for a wonderful dark roast, try ""Sumatra"" - I get it at Sam's Club--although it may be available elsewhere."
4,Excellent Coffee and it is not decaf,"Very nice although it lacks the slightly bitter spark of their French Roast. You can see my review of their French Roast which settles the ""is it decaf?"" question. It is not, despite the description on the side of the bag."
3,Expected more,"Compared to other Altura beans (Sumatra is my favorite), Colombian are just mildly flavorful. Makes good coffee, just not the best. Amazon delivery of Altura coffee is very fast compared to other brands I have tried from them."
2,"Cafe' Altura Colombian Dark, was Bland!","This reminded me of a bland ""Breakfast Blend""! No distinct taste/body at all!If you are looking for a full flavored rich coffee that has a bold/smooth taste!?-Try their Peruvian Dark, Ruta Maya Cubita organic Cuban (Costco.com online- for non-members too!), or Ethical Beans organic Espresso (best Espresso I've had outside of Brazil, and I drip grind/brew it!)!~~~~~~~~~~~~~This is the Best drip coffee Maker I've ever had!For a GREAT cup of coffee without having to Hassle with a messy Espresso/French Press machine!Melitta 46893 12-Cup Coffee MakerI use a Med/fine grind (6), with my KitchenAid burr grinder (shop around, for a better price!)-KitchenAid Pro Line Burr Coffee Grinder - Onyx Black"
4,Good tasting coffee.,"Had to find a good tasting whole bean coffee since Folgers went up in price. I tried several brands. None could even come close till I found this one. It has a bold taste, but is not bitter. I love the smell while it is brewing. It is well worth it for the price."
3,It's O.K.,Not bad coffee for the price but for less money you can get a good Sumatra from the same supplier.
4,It's what you need to know,"This is a very well written book from someone who knows the subject well and who has had a lot of first hand experience with customer needs and real life applications. This is the real world. The subject is vast and complex, but the author brings across the important information that you need to know. I have tried to delve through fibre channel drafts and standards. They are for the most part not readable to outsiders such as myself. The only problem with any literature on fibre channel is that the industry is evolving so quickly. I am starved for information on the latest developments. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in fibre channel and at the same time would recommend staying away from books that are pre-1999. There is just too much that has happened lately."
4,Love it,A wonderful book. It will have a prominent place on my coffee table. I'm proud to have it on display.
2,Theros Ironfeld,"I was very dissapointed with this book, the reason i thought it would be so exciting is how they would tell how theros got his silver arm, and how he got around the making the legendary dragonlances. The book never got around to this large detail in theros's life, the author wrote too much about the low parts of theros's life instead of getting to the meat of his life. I was looking for a sequel to show me what happened to the rest of his life. i think that margeret weiss and tracy hickman should get around to writing a proper biography of Theros Ironfeld."
4,The end of an era.,"To start off, the ""Dancing Machine"" album I felt had too many different sounds on it. Maybe because it had a lot of different producers. But, Hal Davis's title track for the album. Seemed to have given the album exactly what it needed in order for it to keep up the momentum. On the other hand, ""Moving Violations"" seemed to be a much better album. In my opinion I think it was one of the best albums the group ever made for motown. The whole album was produced by Eddie Holland of HDH fame. From the remake of ""Forever came today""(which is one of my favorites) to the romp shaken' ""Body language"" to the smooth ballad ""All I do is think of you"". This album is slammmmm! Even tho' this was there last album they went out on top."
4,cool set,the Dancing Machine ALbum is still cool&Tight.THe Vocals&Production were on point here.but Moving Violation is a better Album on a whole to me.alot of solid tracks on this Album.these Set showcases MJ coming into His own with this set.it's long overdue that this finally got put out.
5,Awesome Helmet!,"I highly reccomend this helmet. I have used it extensively over 2 seasons now, and it works great. The fit is fantastic, and it provides great protection. Keeps the eardrums happy when my head smacks the water hard."
5,Can't wait!!,"Got the helmet in the mail, and it was everything we expected! Looks great, sturdy, and safe. Can't wait to use it this summer!"
1,Bloodworth,"Another super boring, drawn out, pointless movie. I need to stop expecting much because each time I'm let down. Had to take interval breaks throughout because I became so bored and frustrated with my own lack of interest. I was most upset that I spent money to see this film."
2,Had Potential,"This movie, Bloodworth, had potential. The theme and setting were good, dark with a ray of good and set in backwoods Tennesee. There were some good actors too. The main problem is that none of the characters were allowed to develop enough to allow the viewer to be intrigued, or even interested. With better character development and clarity of purpose this would have been a tense, epic-like movie. It felt like much of the film was left on the cutting room floor -leaving big plot development gaps. I believe the novel, Provinces of Night, that this movie is based on is probably real good. (When I checked the reviews it looks like it's real good.) I've never read it but that's how close the movie gets to being memorable. Too bad because it had potential.Any viewers that gave this movie 4 or 5 stars are either shills or big fans of a particular actor."
2,Waste of time,This is a very disappointing movie to the point of being boring. A story of a selfish father that needs help when he's run out of friends.
1,If you read the book....,"If you read William Gay's book, you will be disappointed. While the actors are good, and doing their best, this script is an abysmal effort to take the book to the screen. Watching this movie reminded of the line that is often attributed to Pat Conroy who allegedly said ""Hollywood gave me complete control over how I cashed the check.""Save your money. Buy more books. Donate the money you would spend on this movie to a charity."
4,Vibrant alien stuff,"I have never read Frederik Pohl before, but then I noticed ""O Pioneer!"" sitting on a shelf. I bought it and enjoyed it. The nonchalance of the main character is very humorous, and the aliens described through a human's eyes is funny. The sloth-like aliens were particularly enlightening, and the 'sex' party scene was engaging. I guess I'll look into more Frederik Pohl books, but this review is only from the standpoint of a one-time reader of Pohl. Well, take a lookee see at ""O Pioneer!"" if you like irreverant humor in sci-fi writing."
5,Poetic,"A book to buy and read for anyone interested at all in the highest arts of the written English language. Dr. Bloom, a person with a higher level of knowledge and pure intellect than almost all, has brought together many of the great poems of our civilization. While I did not understand all he said in his introductions, there is no doubt he is a treasure of our society.I am not someone who normally reads poetry. This book gave me access to works by poets (many I had not even heard of) that I would never have read otherwise---which would have been my sad loss."
1,What the %^&*?!,"You are probably better off buying something a textbook from the Norton. Because1. The editor is biased again women and minority poets. To quote Cary Nelson in the Virginia Quarterly Review,""If Bloom's wholesale elimination of poems by women and minorities is disgusting and deplorable, however, it is not especially interesting. It is simply part of the conservative backlash against muticulturalism.""2. He is a conservative who does not like modern experimentation.3. He is biased against poems that show the ugly side of life (ex. war poems, poems about protest or violence).4. He flatly rejects some of the best poems in history that pushed the limits of the English language.5. His idea of the Sublime idea is still stuck in early part of the 19th century.Mr. Bloom, you disappoint me.So go please and find some true poetry. There's a whole WORLD out there."
2,Shameless or shameful?,"You are better off getting the Norton Anthology of Poetry. This book is marketed as a personal selection, yet contains a fairly standard array of poems taken from other anthologies. Do we need Bloom to select some chestnut by Robert Frost for us?"
5,Great Product,I have been using this product for almost 2 years now. Great quality at a great price. I've printed well over 500 prints with my sony printer using this paper and haven't had one problem yet.
3,"Nice job, but a little pricey","We purchased the Sony printer that this photo paper works with. Each time you have completed 25 pictures, you must replace the print cartridge (comes with the paper). I like the quality of the pictures and the color and sharpness are very true, however, (...)for 25 photographs is a little high. It is also very difficult, if not impossible, to program some digital photography software to print to this size paper and thus, you find yourself limited in the editing software you are able to utilize."
1,Makes Stephen Crane Boring!,"This is a WAY over-priced book that makes Crane a really boring person, which I doubt he was. If you really need to read this book do NOT buy it. Get it from the library and drink coffee. I found numerous errors in this book because the author disregards all the other biographies about Crane and makes up his own material."
1,Disappointing,"I waited the 4 weeks it took to get this book and I cannot express how poorly written it is. There are many good books on Crane, but this one is defintely to be avoided. The author is supposed to be a Crane expert but he cannot explain anything clearly. In fact, he seems angry about having to write this book for a living. Avoid this one."
3,Big hits,Nicely done compilation highlighting Mr. Williams' well known romantic songs from 1957 to 1972. And Darcy Proper did a fine job mastering these smooth songs.
3,"Got Hocklee, not Medora","I received the Hocklee model, not the Medora that I ordered. I returned it and was sent another Hocklee (even though Amazon did not have this as a model in its catalog when I placed my order). The Hocklee is a decent backpack but both the original and the replacement have minor stitching defects. It does not have the computer pouch that the Medora has but since I'm only using it for the gym and I got an additional promotional discount I'm going to keep it."
3,Easy Read,I read this book in about 3 hours. I needed a break from my studies. The storyline is quite dated though. This story reminded me of a good black and white AMC classic movie. I could see Barbara Stanwyck or Ginger Rogers playing the leading ladies. It relieved my stress so I gave it 3 stars.
5,What a fun book!!,"I've been a subscriber to Kim and Jason for years, so how could I resist reading the book? I was not disappointed in the least. The humor and down to earthness I love from the comic strip was all right there in the book. If you love childhood you won't be disappointed. And if you don't you should buy this book to find out how to love childhood again!"
4,A great sleeping bag for the price.,"I got this sleeping bag for a January hike in the Adirondacks. I have used it on two such hikes, and it was comfortable even in 10F weather. There is a chest draw string, and I went deep enough into the sleeping back to close that string over my head on the 10F night. The reason I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 star is that this bag packs rather large. I have a 75L Gregory pack, which can fit an adult, and I still usually attach the sleeping bag to the outside. The fact that it's synthetic means it will insulate even when it's wet. The down bags are about 10 times as expensive, but also pack 10 times smaller. I would buy this bag again."
4,The last great season,"I purchased this one for my kids. SpongeBob is unusual, if not unique, being one of the few kids' cartoons that also holds some appeal for adults, at least those young-at-heart. The humor, while generally juvenile, still displays enough sophistication to make watching it with the kids bearable.Until season 4, that is. After season 3, while not all bad, it definitely becomes hit-or-miss, especially with the voice acting for SpongeBob himself, who becomes rather one-dimensional, perpetually even maniacally happy at almost all times. I'm not sure what happened there, but he lost any subtle shading of emotion, despite the fact that I think it's the same voice actor.Anyhow, season 3 is good from beginning to end, all classic episodes. Despite the fact that SpongeBob appears frequently on Nickelodeon, I'd still rather let my kids get their SpongeBob fix from the DVD, without the incessant marketing they would be bombarded with if I let them watch it on TV."
5,Spongebob!!,I got this for my Dad for Father's Day and it came right when it said it would and was in perfect condition. Wonderful!
4,As good as it gets for SpongeBob,Season 3 is the last good effort for SpongeBob as they really started the long slide to stupid the next season.
5,"Spongebob is the best, nothing else to say!","M son loves spongebob. This pack of dvd'sis a great addition to our collection, we just started and we found alot of good deals here on amazon."
5,The last great season of a once great show,"While Spongebob Squarepants has gone downhill as of late, Season 3 is possibly the pinaccle of the series. Almost every - if not all - of the episodes are fantastic, and the fact that the original pilot is included in this set is just gravy on the cake."
4,good,always a kids favorite and has adult humor snuck in there to make the parents enjoy and stay awake throughout the show.
4,great,My grandson love to watch this on the limited TV time that he is allowed to watch while staying with us.
1,overpriced,It was over priced and my grandson downloaded without my authority. It is also really stupid I have to enter so many words for the comment.
3,"some good, some bad","coming off of the first two seasons of this show, the third season leaves much to be desired. there are some great episodes like Wet Painters and Chocolate with Nuts. but then there are some really bad ones to go with it, like Rock a Bye Bi-Valve and any thing with the live action Patchy the Pirate in it. I'd recommend buying the first two seasons and then see this one on Netflix"

5,My kids loved it,kids tuned in just fine. it has pretty good quality and did not have to stop and load or wait on it to load ever 5 seconds. good in my book
5,"Great mix of R&B, jazz and blues","Michelle Willson's albums all have been strong, but this may be her best yet. She offers up a tasty mix of R&B, jazz and blues. Her singing is as strong as ever, with maybe a new intensity. Her band is tight and inspired. This music is full of joy. Highly recommended"
5,special K single serving,I purchased these for my mother in a nursing home and she loves this size because of the container. She does not have to find a bowl. She can have these in her room and it really beats buying a large box for her.
3,click click boom,this cd was a pretty good investment but i have bought better soundtracks. Some tracks were very interesting but i found others boring. I would say it was well below the recent hit the fast and the furious soundtrack but then again they had 2 good ja rule soundtracks and many unknown artists. this soundtrack however had a few well known artists but was mainly unknown artists. i would give this cd a 3 star rating in other words unless ur rick might wanna buy something else. #1 stunna
4,Doesn't work by itself.,You'd have to have seen the movie to understand the edginess of this soundtrack. The movie was not your typical Jesse James story so the soundtrack is not your typical Western themed music. There is the sound of the usual grandiose epic but there is a 21st century sound to it.
3,"Rita is great, but the film is mediocre","I purchased this movie based on a YouTube clip. Rita dances wonderfully (her singing was probably dubbed), but the rest of the film was disappointing - the plot is rather lame. Not as good as Rita's other films."
3,RITA DOWN TO EARTH,IT WASNT ONE OF RITA HAYWORTH BEST I HAVE SEEN AND ENJOYED OTHERS BETTER THE SONGS WERENT WHAT I EXPECTED
3,"Fair Musical - Fabulous Rita, boring Larry, poor Songs !","This is for me the Rita Hayworth movie which had the greatopportunity of being her biggest hit after Gilda but the filma) had no Astaire or Kelly to match Rita's A qualitybut only Larry Parks ( so dull that it's a shame )b) no songs from Kern, Gershwin or Porter but rather stupid songswhere not one song became a hit (...)c) had no good dance numbersOtherwise the story is a pleasant fairytale and Rita Hayworth isas beautiful as she can be, that's why it is still worthwile to watch it."
5,Charming & Etherial - A Lost Genera,"This is one of my favorite Rita Hayworth movies. This musical represents a lost genera of the silver screen with its innocent, charming and etherial content and style. I especially loved the variations of ""Swinging the Muses."""
3,Very interesting but not too practical...food for thought,"This book is very easy to read and describes interesting relationship between colors numbers and days...I have been practising some of this concepts and guidelines. However, it is not very practical if you have a very active life or you dislike wearing specific colors."
1,Don't buy it,"I Usually like Louise Hay's books, but I'm very disappointed with this one, doesn't contain some much information, it's tiny and poor, you can find more and free information on the web.Colors & Numbers: Your Personal Guide to Positive Vibrations in Daily Life"
3,There is Better Stuff from Louise Hay,"This is OK, but there's a lot more materials from Louise Hay (and other Hay House authors) that would be a better investment of your time -- not to mention money. I consider this more fluff than substance. I'd recommend ""Heal Your Life"" by Louise Hay; ""The Unmistakeable Touch of Grace"" by Cheryl Richardson."
5,Fun & useful!,"I have really enjoyed this book. It's not so much a book as fun little guide as the title implies. It's a quick easy read. Even my eight year old daughter loves to ask what her color is each morning and pick an outfit to match. I like how it sets a beginning, middle and end cycle to the days in 10 day increments. I haven't done or not done something in my life because it's a certain number day, but I have used it to be mindful of where I am at on each day and the daily affirmations are beautiful and inspiring. Thank you Louise L. Hay."
3,Colors & Numbers & Repetition,"This simple guide offers a new twist to Numerology via which color is added. While not that new a concept (the Rosicrucians have used it for eons), Ms. Hay offers some novel applications to the idea.As a Reader I have used color in my Readings for decades, much of which I learned from my friend Richard Webster in New Zealand. I find that working with color adds valuable layers to any Reading and a means by which to enrich a client's life; empowering them when it comes to simple rituals that allow them to claim their personal power in everyday life by doing everyday things. Louise's book adding to that advantage and so, just as I've done with her ""You Can Heal Your Life"" material, this is another that I must encourage folks to use as a guide, be it the client or the Reader."
2,Nothing new in here,"I like Louise Hay -- but I'm disappointed in this little book. There's nothing new in here that any beginning -- BEGINNING -- numerology book wouldn't tell you; in fact, it's free on the internet. I give it 2 stars just because it's Louise; otherwise 0."
5,Great Book,I love this book. This author's books are very positive and uplifting. I found this one helpful and fun.
3,Colors & Numbers,"This book had the information I was looking for but I am still not to hip on ebooks, I like to hold a book in my hand. But the information is good."
5,Perfect New Year Book,This book is easy to read and I already have made out my calendar for myself and found out universal year #'s for friends and family!
3,Outdated book on C-130,"This book was published in 1981, which makes it 29 years old. That's the reason for 3 stars. It's great coverage on the infamous C-130 ""Herc"" which was first flown in 1955. There's just a lot of this plane's history that has happened since.It is a real tribute to the designers of Lockheed that this plane in still in active service as of 2010 and will be for a long time to come. Many versions have served as cargo haulers, gunships, troop transport in peace and at war, the Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard of many nations use this versatile and reliable airplane.56 pages, 2 of them color drawings, lots of clear black and white photos, line drawings, charts, statistics make this an excellent buy for a modeler or aviation buff - as long as you understand that the Gulf wars, Grenada, Panama Wars are not included here. Even that's ok - most of the improvements over the years have been to the avionics, engines and not so visible to the average person"
3,Poor service,"This, like other Samsung products, worked great for a few months. All of a sudden it won't recognize my Mac from the DVI port. The Mac works fine with other monitors, and even a Dell LCD TV. But the Samsung no longer recognizes it. Support from both the Tweeter store where I purchased it and from Samsung direct were absolutely NO help. I would stay away from Samsung and Tweeters for this reason."
5,great product,"This set is great for the price, and a great gift item. It is a bit heavy, but it's not something to carry around all the time. That's why it's a piece you wanna keep at home and use whenever you have people over to play poker."
1,Worst Movie Ever,I was honestly surprised by all the glowing reviews posted here. This is absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen. My son and I went to see it together and walked out half-way through the movie. I have never done that before!
1,King Ralph,"Ordered this DVD through Amazon.com. When I received it and tried to play it, it said wrong region. In the trash!"
4,Very Funny!!,"This is a great movie - it was made in 1991 but is still hilarious! John Goodman plays an American who inherits the throne in England and has to deal with the culture shock and his new-found royal obligations. If you liked him in the role of Dan Conner on Roseanne, you will enjoy him in this movie. Peter O'Toole plays his loyal assistant who has to teach him how to act like a king and steals many of the scenes much the way Hobson did in the movie Arthur. I highly recommend this movie! It is very funny and one of those movies you can watch over and over and still crack up every time - and the great thing about DVD is you can skip to the highlights!"
4,An underrated film; actually quite good!,John Goodman shines in this comedy about an American commoner ascending to the British throne in an extremely-unlikely situation. A lot of good acting and funny moments in a seamless plot.
3,Oops - I didn't pay attention,"I thought, from the photo, that this was a straightforward plastic model. When it arrived I learned it was a stack of stamped wood that looks like it will be the dickens to assemble. My mistake and hopefully my kid can work it out."
5,Phenomenal War Movie,"I have seen more war movies than I care to remember, including the John Wayne epics, and even a Ronald Reagan ""masterpiece."" The good ones, in my opinion, include Das Boot, A Bridge Too Far, Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, and Apocalypse Now. However, never have I seen a film to equal Stalingrad. If ever a film showed the stupidity of war and the shameless exploitation of soldiers by their government, this is the one. I suspect that German audiences were struck dumb with horror, especially those old enough to remember the battle or even to have participated. If not, they should have been."
3,"Excellent movie, bad dubbing","A good story, well worth the telling - and much better described by other reviewers than by me. But - this is the dubbed-into-English version. I've a copy of this and it's disappointing - so much so that I'm prepared to drop another $20 or so on the German-language version, English subtitles. And no, I don't speak German. I enjoyed 'Das Boot', and 'Wings over Berlin' immensely. I'm comfortable with subtitles. You should be too - this is a German story, made by Germans."
4,A depressing but solid movie,1. This is one of the very good / solid war movies that one would probably just watch once.. because it depicts the war as it was--> hell.
3,"Stalingrad, the Movie","The movie is in German and the acting is only so-so but, the message is plain to see, frozen Hell on earth. The film certainly does not gloss over the horror of war at its most savage level."
5,Reality of War,"The Battle for Stalingrad was perhaps the most bloody, horrific, and personal of all battles in the 20th century. This film gives a no nonsense view of the fight from the view of the common German soldier. Heroism, glory, nobilty, even sanity went away like an illusion in the crucible of urban warfare, Over a million soldiers on both sides died, the wounded unknown, and perhaps even the real count of those killed will probably never be known.This film grips the viewer and draws them into the nightmare better than any other film about the war on the Eastern Front. Like DAS BOOT, this is a must see, must have for any student of combat and its unshakable truths.Georg S."
2,"Disappointing, with some good parts","After reading and hearing first-hand accounts of the Battle of Stalingrad I found this movie very disappointing. While it tried, I don't think it came close to expressing the horrors and tragedy of the battle, and worse, it had too much contrived silliness, such as the scenes with the young Russian woman. It does deserve credit for showing that humanity existed among some of the German and Russian troops, and for some effective combat scenes. If you would like to see a better movie about warfare in Eastern Europe, I strongly recommend the Finnish movie ""The Winter War"" (in Finnish ""Talvisota""), about the 1939-1940 fighting between Finland and the Soviets. It has excellent characters and shows the terror of combat and the cameraderie, squalor and sorrows of the front lines, and life on the home front. It is not as slickly made as ""Stalingrad,"" which actually is a point in its favor."
3,Stalingrad? A Misnomer,"While this movie is supposed to take place during the epic battle of Stalingrad, this movie has nothing to do with this 6/7 month battle. If you are looking for a movie that accurately portrays this battle, this movie definitely is NOT it. Any military buff is going to be sorely disappointed. How a movie about this battle can ignore and not recreate the famous battles of Stalingrad such as the Red October factory, the Tractor works, or the Barricady Gun factory is beyond my understanding. The title of the movie is just that: just a title. The battle scenes could come from any street-to-street battle on the Eastern Front. Just put Platoon and put it on the Eastern Front and you'll have a pretty good idea of what this movie is like. Ok for war freaks who care nothing for historical accuracy and just want a ""war sucks"" message."
2,Huge potential; saddly disappointing.,"Folks, this is a light-weight film, predictably European in flavor. Some nice shots of German and Soviet equipment, a very nice battle scene...German soldiers fighting T-34s with only shaped charges to press their attack...but other than that its flat , sometimes boring. I know this will ruffle some feathers, and I mean no disrespect to the brave soldiers who were wasted in Stalingrad. Indeed, they deserve better than this. It's not even in the same ballpark as ""All's Quiet on the Western Front"" or ""Saving Private Ryan."" If you have studied the battle, and your are a fan of realism, you will be unhappy with this movie."
2,A Disappointing Movie about Stalingrad,"I viewed the movie with great anticipation. I have read about the battle, and seen various tv documentaries. The movie just didn't work well for me. The German soldiers were starving and filthy by the time of the surrender in 1943 - these guys had a few days growth on their faces and looked pretty healthy. The Lt that was always making a general nuisance of himself was unbelievable, and his role smacked of revisionism. The final scenes were completely unbelievable - desertion; trying to get on the last plane out etc. I guess I was expecting the same quality as Das Boot."
3,Blood and Guts with no story line to keep it in context,"While the technical production was excellent the film lacks continuity and orientation. If you have the urge to see this movie read one of the good books on the same subject first, otherwise this film is just a sensational ""Stephen Speilberg"" type of flick with dramatic and bloody scenes not particuarly related to each other and certainly not identifiable as the awful story of Stalingrad, probably the most horrific event of the Second World War."
3,Cast of Dozens,"To be sure, with 95% of all war movies being garbage, this is a good flick. However, it lost its opportunity for greatness when it passed on being the portrait of a decisive turning point in the world's greatest conflict. Obviously done on a tight budget with limited research, most of the battle sequences are shot nearsighted in scale so few tanks and actors are needed. Street fighting is limited to one brief episode in a factory. The added intrigue of the evil German officer (something out of an Indiana Jones flick) was out of place as well as being inaccurate for that period of the war (that crap started after Hitler's assassination, years later). Missing is the overconfidence and arrogance that turns to surprise and shock with the German's facing their first defeat. Another omission is the bitter determination displayed by well-trained career soldiers who knew they weren't leaving alive. In this film the Germans come off as a retagged bunch of draftees just waiting to lose."
3,This was part of a two part order. Both arrived. A previous order for a longer Stalingrad DVD never arrived so I tried again.,This was more economical of my viewing time than the one that never arrived and probably was better in that respect. The subject is impossible to review since the topic was the most painful fighting of WWII.
3,Don't forget the gal,"I've scanned about 40 of the reviews below and none of them seemed to mention the rather implausible plot element of the beautiful Russian girl (with a German mother) whose life is spared by a handful of German soldiers, and who is shot down as she, in turn, tries to lead them to safety (??) somewhere out on the steppe. This element was quite a surprising fall from the fairly carefully rendered combat sequences that reviewers describe."
4,Depressing + Engaging acting + Realistically showing the terror of war = Definitely worth watching.,"The movie is very depressing. The acting is very engaging. The director realistically shows the terror of war. I read in the books that soldiers, civilians, and horses frozen to death along the trails in Stalingrad. However, it horrifed me when I saw these scenes in this film because they were so real.It's definitely worth watching. I'm not sure if I want to watch it the second time though."
4,SOBERING...,There have been a number of movies both foriegn and US domestic filmed that have been based on this WWII battle which took place at the hieght of German advancement into Russia. This movie was produced by a German production studio whom I assume had access to living veterans who actually took part in the battle of Stalingrad. If this assumption is correct and given my personnal knowledge of this particular battle I conclude this film gives one of the most accurate accounts to date of what actually took place during that brutal conflict. I wasn't surprised at the anti war undertones that were conveyed throughout the picture. Germany alone suffered more casualties than America did throughout the whole war in this one battle. To say it was devastating to the German people is an understatement...it was a nightmare...
5,a very graphic movie and holds you attention,A good movie very explicit maybe a bit overdone showing the German soldier in a poor light a little undisciplined always sterotyping.
3,"Good Movie, But Lacks In Some Aspects","Stalingrad is a worthwhile movie to rent or buy. It's a realistic depiction of war with all of its violence and destruction. But still after a few times of viewing this movie, it lacks in places. The acting is good, the battle scenes excellent, and the cinematography great, but it lacks in some aspects. The opening scene of Italy is gorgeous. I'm still sort of unclear on some of the reasons why the movie could've been better, but I do know it sort of drags in place, and it's sort of hard to feel part of it. This aside, this is still a recommended movie and is a good companion to Das Boot on anybody's shelf."
1,Waste of time and money,"This movie was a real disappointment. Nothing about it was impressive. It seemed that all the scenes were shot and then edited together. Nothing flowed and you can easily get lost trying to figure out what was going on. To compare this film to Saving Private Ryan is nonsense. Not even in the same league. After the first 20 minutes I really didn't want to watch it anymore. I fast forwarded through the rest, stopping occasionally and then moving on. Enemy at the Gates was a much better Stalingrad movie."
3,Did anybody notice the RunTime of this DVD?,"I'v recently watch this DVD again,and I found out my Parasound DVDPlayer showed that the RunTime of this film is 137 min,NOT what the boxcover said 150 min,and I checked the IMDB data of Stalingrad (1993),it showed the Runtime: 134 min / Argentina:135 min ,also diff.from what Fox Lorber says,Mine is the origional R1 edition. ..."
4,Its Hard to Empathize with Nazi Storm Troopers But....,"The director here does a good job. If there was a hell on Earth this it. Men at war are often depicted as one dimensional goons looking for glory and riches and who know's what else. How much more so German soldiers? Unlike allid soldiers who made a sacrifice these men and women were just sacrified for, what boils down to, a mad man's bent ideal. I'll stop well short of defending their actions. What I'll say is this movie does not strip any of the characters of their humanity. The viewer begins to have more contempt for the circumstances than any of the characters. Horribly accurate in its outcome, I'm giving this film 4 stars for its potential to provoke empathy."
2,Not thrilled,This movie did show the battle with Stalingrad during WWII but it was too racy and had much profanity...and I had periods of boredom. Not good to show to a history class of students.
4,Stalingrad-A Good Film To See,"If you're looking for a romantic ending type of war movie, when a hero comes in to save the day, this is not the movie to watch. This movie is told through the eyes of German Storm Troopers who are trapped in Russian where in their only option is to be killed in battle or to freeze to death. The besiegement of the city of Stalingrad quickly turns from a seemingly ingenious decision by Hitler into the hellist realization of the imminent defeat of the German army. There are two major war scenes, the openning one in the city of Stalingrad and the second on the outskirts of the city (infantry verses tank battle). Both scenes are good but contain slighly unbelievable parts. This movie will be a good addition to your war movie collection. Although I do not speak any foreign language, I recommend that you buy all foreign films with subtitles and not English dub over versions. Also see the French film ""Capitaine Conan""."
2,POOR war movie,"This movie is certainly not worth buying in DVD. If it is shown on TV it's Ok, but you will not want to see it again. There is basically no plot and the historical content (how the battle unfolds) is not a focus at all. It's all about following a bunch of German soldiers trying to survive. Even this could be Ok, if only the acting was not so BAD. A thousand times better is Cross of Iron and ten times better Ennemy at the Gates for a real Russian front experience."
2,Not worth $...,"I wouldn't pay ten dollars for this movie. It has far too many flaws. For example the blood is obviously fake and the severed body parts look faker than Britany Spears. Aside from the bad fx, the plot is weak. The last forty minutes drags on,and on. The english dugging is terrible, they say things not even closely resembling the original actor's lines. Buyer beware, don't believe the hype about this movie. Buy Cross of Iron instead."
1,right over the film-makers' heads,"This movie says more about the consequences of The Second World War than the film-makers ever imagined and it might be just as well for them that they didn't. The best German genes were killed off with the aggressive warriors who bore them. The lesser genes stayed home or ran away and their offspring made movies about giving up, shooting one's self, and consorting with the enemy. One look at one of the starring ""German soldiers"" indicated the actor's true ethnicity and when I looked it up I was confirmed. Some people, so to speak, will do anything for money!And it was an obvious attempt to play off of the success of PLATOON in uniforms that looked aptly too much like olive drab than Feldgrau."
2,A reminder of how bad Foreign films are,"I read a lot of books about Stalingrad, and decided to buy this DVD, after watching this movie, I was sorry for discounting the negative Amazon reviews before buying it, this film is a real disappointment, the acting would have to be the worst I have ever seen, you NEVER feel that your with them in battle, but rather with them on a movie set. The film is about a small group of German soldiers enduring the suffering of war, much like the movie Platoon, showing a more humane side, leaving out most of the atrocities committed by the Germans. The language is German and dubbed in English, so if you watch it in English, don't expect there lips to be in synch, its better watching it in German and reading the subtitles. This film really belongs in the $5 dollar bin at your local shopping mart, definitely NOT worth $28!."
3,"Good, but not great","When I first saw this film, I was blown away. In hindsight (and compared to more recent films), it is not as impressive. The plot is a bit predictable (the female Russian soldier was a tad too much). But the battle in the snow against the tanks still ranks as one of the best choreographed battles in film. Still a good film about an awful chapter in history."
2,A film with an agenda.,"This is not an unfiltered look at this epic battle, but rather an anti-war, Oliver Stone-ish statement wrapped conveniently in the most devastating battle of the 20th century. It is, as well, palpably over-sympathetic to the Soviets at various points. Additionally, the film is capped by a truly bizarre bunker scene involving a few German soldiers and a Russian woman. The only saving grace for the film are some cool battle scenes."
4,Very informative and helpful; odd section on saving money,"This book is pretty informative and gives helps guide you on preparing your finances. It talks about a lot of pitfalls to watch out for, and gives you some straight opinions on employer retirement plans and debt management, as well as some thoughts on good debt vs. bad debt.The only problem I have with it is the section on cutting costs. It is a little out of place and some of the recommendations on how to save money are a little bizarre and out there. Shaving your head to save money on hair supplies and taking naps at home for vacation instead of going away got a raised eyebrow from me, as did his belief that you have to be a small business or nonprofit to get a Costco membership. He also talks about giving up meat as a possible avenue for cost savings (because it costs a lot).Like I said, the rest of the book seems to have sound financial guidance. The section on saving money?Take it with a grain of salt."
2,Ok for Freshmens,"The book is OK, but very basic, I got it for school; and the coarse is a college coarse. It does give good advise for beginners."
3,"Shipped fast, books alright.","This book gets the main points across. I haven't finished it yet but there are some spots that make it hard to read. The author seems to bash on sales people of many kinds throughout what I've read. Which is extremely annoying since I'm a sales person, and the world would be pretty tough without sales people. He basically makes it seem like all salesman/women are scam artists and just want your money, when that is in fact not the case. If I could have bought a different book I would have, but to get the main information, this book works alright overall."
1,Hype not Might,"This book is nothing but a regurgitation of information available in most financial institutions. The book has two main themes, no credit and save money. Those are both a duh; for most people getting the money budgeted to save is the problem. Most of the detail in this book focuses on where and how to invest all your money."
4,Great Book for Anyone Seeking Sage Advise,Gave this to my son to help him understand how sound financial knowledge at his young age will pave a brighter future for him now & later on in life. Easy to read & captures the essence of slow + smart decisions vs impulsive ones.dwc
4,Good if youre finances are OK.,"Sadly I bought this book too late, if I had it 5 years back I would be in a better financial position. To be honest I got depressed while reading it and I had to stop reading. On the other hand if your finances are OK this book will help you maintain you finances healthy."
2,Not very helpful,"After stuffing myself with over a dozen mutual funds and half a dozen checking accounts (thanks to $... handed out by Internet-based banks), I suddenly realized I suck at personal financial planning, so I bought this book. Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed.This is truly a book for dummies. It covers a lot of little basic things, but nothing well at all. It's a jack of all trades but master of none in real life. The messages were simple: save and stay away from debt, but the material was loosely organized which makes it difficult for the reader to synthesize -- wasn't the writer who was supposed to do that? -- and implement. Basically after reading it you'll scratch your head and wonder where to start. If you were not a dummy, you'll feel like a dummy."
2,This book was OK at best,"I would not recommend this book. It is very short sighted. For a more in-depth look into proper financial planning, I would look elsewhere. If you are starting out new in financial planning take a look at this book for the budgeting part. Then look elsewhere for the other parts."
4,Great book. Lots of suggestions.,"I've had this for a while now and have loaned it to a few people. A very well written book. I hate books where the author thinks you know a ton of stuff going in, even though they are 'beginner' books. This one is written in easy to understand language, yet in a smart way. I'm not sure if there is a newer release, but the one I have is very good. As with most advice, though, you have to use what you can. If more people read this and used some of the advice, there would be a lot less credit problems now a days. The best advice is don't buy with credit--if you don't need it today, save up and buy it. If you can afford the payments, you can afford the savings even more."
4,Pretty Good Book,"I've been working on ways to manage my finances better, so I checked out Personal Finance for Dummies. It was a pretty good book. I liked when the author pointed out common mistakes you can make, but the investing stuff wasn't really for me.I would have almost liked to see the investing part in another book and a deeper look on handling debt."
5,Good Book - Can't wait to pass it on,"This is such a great book, I will probably by a copy for my eighteen year old sister. The book provides valuable information that is valuable at any age, but even better if she can learn now. Great practical tips on debt management, saving, budgeting retirement, etc."
4,Great Info,I'm over half-way through the book and it's been very informative. All the subjects I wanted to learn about in one easy to read book.
3,Pretty good book.,"I like the book, but wish it were less repetitive. I think that Andrew Tobias' book, The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need, is more succint. I wish that he would update it given the new state of the economy. 3-4 years makes a huge difference in tax laws."
3,"good, could have been better","Eric Tyson has a pleasant, friendly voice and he's certainly done a comprehensive job, covering most financial issues--and simplifying many of them. My biggest problem with the book, isn't really Mr. Tyson's fault, it's the ""Dummies"" format. I find all the icons and the supposedly friendly format annoying and confusing. A few other ways I think the book could be better: First, it's often repetitive (I think it could be a 1/4 to a 1/3 shorter--even if they left in all the icons and cartoons); Second, the writing is a bit sloppy at times, and third, I wish he'd be more definitive with his recommendations. Of course, choice is nice, but us ""dummies"" need more direction. I actually preferred The Mindful Money Guide; this book masterfully simplifies financial matters, while still remaining comprehensive. It's extremely well written, has a good sense of humor, and doesn't forget there's more to life than the bottom-line."
5,It could change your life!,"If you have just landed your first ""real"" job or are trying to get your financial life in order, this is the book for you! Tyson uses plain English and entertaining anecdotes to outline the basics of investing, mortgages, taxes and insurance. I first read this book in 1996, and Tyson's strategies have kept me from making numerous stupid financial decisions (and helped me save a lot of money).Tyson's book was like a Personal Finance 101 class from which I went on to read Jane Bryant Quinn's ""Making the Most of Your Money"" and then more complex books about the stock market, investing and taxes. He provides a solid foundation without the bias of so many finance books. There is so much hype out there (mostly from people who are trying, directly or indirectly, to sell you something) that it can get confusing and intimidating. Tyson cuts to the chase and gives you the tools to put your financial house in order. You'll sleep better at night!"
4,Good place to start!,"This is a wonderful finance guide for anybody! It deals with the basics mostly (credit card debt is bad- don't spend more than you have...) This book is ideal for anyone who hasn't paid much attention to their finances, maybe a learning tool for teens and 20-somethings?"
5,Best on Personal Finance in plain English,"This is the best Personal Finance book written in plain English that I have read. I will be buying one for each of my grown children. They aren't listening to me about saving ""for a rainy day"" so I hope that equipped with the information in this book, they will get the full picture. (and it won't be from Mom)."
4,Definitely worth a read if you're struggling financially,"I got this book right after purchasing my first house, because I knew I needed help with several things: 1) staying on top of my money so I could pay the mortgage on time every month, 2) understanding all my options regarding things like refinancing my home and so on, 3) starting a savings account, and 4) some sort of retirement account sometime in the future. This book has helped me with all of those. The author seems somewhat conservative at certain points, and advises a few things I wouldn't do (or advises against things I don't think are as big of a risk as he does)--but hey, he's a finance guy, of course he's conservative! Overall, this book is very clearly and simply written, and exhaustive in what it covers. I feel like I'm well on my way toward much better financial health as a result of reading it."
5,comprehensive and concise,"No matter how old you are or how much money you make, you can use the advice in this book. This book is not sensationalist in any way; the author does not try to apply one formula to everyone's financial situation. Instead, this book helps you realize on paper what your current financial picture looks like, and then helps you to form and plan sensible goals.It comprehensively yet succinctly addresses banking, saving, investing, spending, debt management, taxes, real estate, and insurance."
4,Good for beginners,Some of the stuff is known info for people who have done some reading on the web but it's definitely a good guide for the beginners. I didn't really read other beginner personal finance books so it's hard for me to compare.
1,"Looks great, but rusts!","Love the look of this dispenser, but within about a month of using it, it started to rust around the edges. Apparently, a hand soap dispenser is not meant to be near water...go figure. Anyway, save your money and look elsewhere."
5,"If you like Kiyoshi Yoshida, you'll love Uttara Kuru","I own the Asian Drums II CD, and got this because someone with similar taste recommended it to me. I think that I like this CD much better. The music is nothing short of awesome. The common denominator between all of the songs is the flute. The only criticism I can offer is that some people say that the songs are better without the flute, but I love it. Another great thing is that, when I bought it, it came with incense sticks. Cool, huh?"
2,Unfortunate,"If you're looking for he skill and talent of the likes of Jia Peng Fang or Mizuyo Komiya, don't, I repeat-don't look here. While having some interesting elements, East Wind and Prayer are the only Asian albums I have purchased that have woefully dissapointed me. I love eclectic blends of Asian music combined with true talent. Neither East Wind nor Prayer appeal to me as anything close to enjoyable and aren't even in the same category as Jia Peng Fang or Mizuyo Komiya. Save your $$ unless you enjoy Hip/Hop/Fusion/Asian/Ornamental blends not altogether well executed."
2,This product [stinks],"I thought that the minidisc player [stinks]. I was stupid enough to buy one without knowing that it records in real time. It records at 1x real spead. That is terribe!!! I was trying to save money and not buy a cd-r. So i got ripped off, because right now, with the new model it records at 32x speed. That pisses me off. I am disgusted with this product."
3,Ouch,"These boots look amazing...but when I first put them on, I noticed there was almost no padding in them, but they felt alright otherwise. Then I stood around for the next 20 minutes until my feet started to really hurt from the height of the heel and the hardness of the unpadded sole.I am not used to wearing heels quite this high (I usually wear between 2-3 inches high), but the reviews I read promised they were comfortable and they weren't. I need boots I can walk in all day long, so these are not what I'm looking for. Also, what the other review says about the calves is true - they are huge, and I don't have small calves."
2,"Entertainment, but no instruction","Hughes provides some backstory on a number of corporations, and those insights are mildly amusing. He also pulls bits from his career and weaves them into the text. But there's no real how-to here. The result is a book that is entertaining, but offers little in the way of instruction for entrepreneurs seeking to get big buzz for low bucks. Poor copy editing compounds the pain; virtually every page has at least one error in grammar or syntax. If you're captivated by reality TV and typically read supermarket tabloids, Buzzmarketing will suit you fine. If you're hoping for a step-by-step structure for building your business, look elsewhere."
4,A Good book,This item was really a gift. The recipient informed me that he got valuable information from it.I gave it 4 stars because I didn't have direct indulgence.
5,Fast Read - Definitely Worth The Money,"I absolutely loved this book. I do a lot of marketing consulting for a variety of businesses and this will help me tremendously in this field.This guy has a story for everything, which makes it much easier to remember the effective parts of this book. I will probably use some of the ideas out of this book, but I will definitely use this book to help me generate more ideas in the future.Great Read!"
3,Press Agentry in the 21st Century,"What Mark Hughes calls ""Buzz Marketing""- getting people to talk about your product- has been with us since people slipped the Town Crier a few extra quid to mention their nostrums in his mightly rounds. Call it flacking, press agentry or what have you, it's the art of getting people to do your advertising for you by creating a story that keeps your product in the public eye.What Hughes has done in ""Buzzmarketing"" is to collect a number of stories about how various marketers, including himelf, have used ways other than direct advertising to get people talking about their products. It's not a manual of how to create a buzz, but rather just a selection of interesting stories about how other did it. Creative types will no doubt find inspiration here, but those looking for a how-to guide will be disappointed. An interesting read for anyone curious about marketing."
2,Not a good refernce tool....,"What you learn out of buzz marketing is that in order to push a particular product or business, creating the ""buzz"", the interest, is key. There are more examples of what the author did in his own career to create buzz that in my opinion does not apply to the average small business. Buy the book if you want to hear a success story, dont buy it if you are looking for ideas on how to apply for your own business."
1,Obvious writer bias ruins interesting subject,Better books on the time period can be found. The writer distorts historical fact to fit her own agenda.
2,Ungrateful Daughters,"Although I am interested in the history of the English monarch, I found this book to be very dry and a bit boring. it is divided into multiple parts. At first it gives a series of biographies for each of the important actors of the time, Queen Mary Beatrice, Princess Anne, Princess Mary, King James II, and Prince William of Orange. These biographies cover the same time period and often overlap. I think it could have been much better written or organized. While both sisters were vilified, Anne came across as the master manipulator. The author showed her obvious dislike for Anne through her descriptions of her physical appearance and behavior. Further, she described Mary's reign in detail while ignoring Anne's. In addition, I expected to read more information about King James' son. The book did not describe his attempts to retake the crown or how Mary and Anne thwarted such attempts. Overall, I found this book to be disappointing."
4,A page-turner for women,"UGRATEFUL DAUGHTERS has the elements of a good chick flick in that it captured and held my attention, gave my emotions a fierce aerobic work-out and put my measly problems in perspective. Months after reading it I'm left with the sad image of the overthrown king, James II's forlorn coffin lying in a chapel in Paris - awaiting reburial in Westminster Abbey. A reburial that never came. ""Instead, the luckless Jame's earthly remains fell victim to the fury of the san-culottes as the French Revolution of 1789 swept away the old regime."" pg. 401I am the type of person who needs a spoonful of sugar/romance/violence/betrayel/heartbreak/death to help the history go down, and Waller delivered.Two of my daughter loved this book and I'm now mailing it off to my favorite aunt for her to enjoy."
2,Not helpful for me,"My son has been having latching problems due to my milk overproduction and VERY forceful letdown, so my nipples are usually very sore. My lactation consultant suggested these for my sore nipples, but because I overproduce so much milk, the pressure of the shells on my areola hurts just as bad as my sore nipples! So, this product has not been too helpful for me. The Medela Soft Shells for Inverted or Flat Nipples did help me fix my flat nipple problem at the beginning, though. And a good solution to those useless little sponges - my LC suggested putting tampons inside the shells instead of the sponges. They soak up SO much more leaking milk and kept me from soaking through my clothing!"
4,Life saver for sore nipples,"This is a great product for sore nipples. It also helped with my flattened nipples when my milk first came in and I was experiencing engorgement. The only downfall is that if you are a heavy leaker (as I am) the inserts will not absorb all the milk and will spill as soon as you bend over. I had to stop using them because of this. But the short amount of time I was able to use them allowed my nipples to heal, and I don't really need them anymore."
2,Not comfortable!,"I did not find these things to be comfortable at all! Nor did my sore, cracked, bleeding nipples find relief becasue I used these. The only thing that truly worked was the Lansinoh cream and exposing myself to air as much as humanly possible."
3,Painful!,"I'm sure if I gave these more of a chance, they may have worked well, but they just hurt too much for me to keep using them. I have slightly larger breasts (a D cup right now) and extra large nipples, so I am probably one of the few people who would have problems with these.The interior plastic part that goes around the areola pushed into mine too much and would honestly leave deep red marks in my areolas. They were just as painful, if not more so than the sore nipples that I was experiencing.I may try them again since my nipples are starting to become sore again, but if the red rings start showing up again, I think they're going to go in the trash!!"
3,"Good product, but there is another way to solve the problem","I used this shells for about a month because my nipples were sore. When I was wearing them while sleeping, I had to wear the medela bra; otherwise the shells would come out of the bra with the regular sleeping bras, like the one from Motherhood Maternity. Another thing I discovered while wearing them is that you have to put a pad in between the shells and the bra. If you don't do that, your bra and bed will get wet.The reason why I stop wearing them is that while reading a book I learned that to avoid sore nipples, you first have to make sure that your baby is not sucking on the nipple only, and also, when you are done feeding or pumping, don't wipe your nipples and cover them immediately. Instead, let them air-dry for a few minutes. The breastmilk is supposed to help the nipples like a moisturizer."
3,It was better than I thought,I didn't expect them to work very well. I must say I did get some relief while using them. I was still in a little pain but that was to be expected. I would recommend that anyone tries them because it may work better for someone else.
5,instant relief!,"These are truly worth every penny! I felt relief instantly, they are very comfortable and within one day I felt a big difference during nursing. I wear them day and night along with using the nuk moisture balm. Instead of using the foam inserts I just used a bit of tissue inside so I could just throw it away when it becomes wet. Not very noticeable under clothing."
1,Uncomfortable,I don't recommend these shields. I ended up with red circles on my areola because of the pressure from the plastic. When I first put them on I thought it would be good but it quickly became very uncomfortable.
2,They made painful circles just outside the nipple for me,"Although they seem helpful for certain situations, I wasn't too impressed. I'm still glad that I have them in case someday they prove helpful."
2,Enh.,"I bought these because they come with foam inserts to help collect leakage. I'm a 38 DD and use the large flange for my medela pump, so I too found the sharp edge that contacts the breast was cutting into my sore areola/nipple. The ameda shells had a round edge and were much more comfortable, although leakage city! My sore nipples got nearly instantly better using my brest friend (great proper latch!), and treatment for a mild yeast infection. Hope this helps."
5,Great product!,"If I didn't have these I would have quit nursing weeks ago! I was so sore the first 4 weeks, I almost quit...these are a must-have if you are sore. They are very comfortable and look pretty natural through clothing. They do cause a little leaking, but just change the foam inserts regularly, or wear a breast pad over them. They are easily worth the $15, if not much more!"
2,"I liked the movie, but...","This is a bizarre and original adaptation of De Sade's ""Justine: Or The Misfortunes of Virtue."" The original title was ""Cruel Passion."" Unfortunately, ""Redemption"" has been censoring their films lately: this one was among those that suffered from some cutting. What was wonderful about ""Redemption"" was that they released obscure and artistic horror films intact, but that hasn't been the case lately. I've only seen this film complete on video. I would have rated it four stars if ""Redemption"" hadn't hacked it to pieces..."
3,Ok train set,Nice idea--all train pieces in a box at a great price--but my 3 year old son was never relaly interested in it. Good quality.
3,Great Phone But Being Phased Out,"I've had an I330 since 2003. It was an excellent phone and PDA, but I wouldn't recommend buying one, even a used one because:1. Accessories are very difficult to find. You can't find a replacement stylus. With no stylus, you will have to use your fingertip or carry a different one around. The problem is that other stylus will not fit in the built in shaft. Sprint PCS doesn't even carry some I330 parts on its web site and its stores never have accessories because it has been discontinued. Batteries are becoming scarce.2. Echo problem is bad and very annoying. Callers will complain about an echo. The problem is that if you use the handsfree speakerphone option, the microphone will not cut off, even if you power down. You have to remove the battery and then power up."
5,Outstanding!!!,"There are not enough stars to rate this phone. If you have never tried a ""smart phone"" you will love this phone. The pda/cell phone combo makes life so easy. You've got your schedule and all your contact data with you, all the time. No more carrying around a cell phone, palm and pager.I have email, web, word, excel, powerpoint all on my I330. Very easy to use and unlimited flexibility as to what apps you install on it. Take it as far as you want and need to. Lots of user groups to support your learning curve. This cell phone is state of the art.Try it! You won't be disappointed."
3,Not great,"phone quality is good. Button layout doesn't make whole lot of sense. So many buttons so little it can do. I was on travel last winter for a month. guess what heppened when i cameback? all my address book is lost! PC sync does not always work. battery life is average.pros:1. sound quality2. screen size3. look & feelcons:1. battery life (may be due to big screen)2. Not easy to list out missed calls3. Some basic features needs stylus. For example, if i want to save a number from incoming call list i need to click File -> Save"
4,"I thought you were gonna do one of ""these""...","This is an old favorite of mine, when it comes to sports comedies. There is something about the way it all came together for this movie that keeps it from getting ""tired"" over time.We've all seen the story of the underdog team of misfit athletes that band together to overcome the odds... but it works in this movie, with this cast, and it works very well. The team doesn't ""win it all"" this time around. They simply prove themselves to be legitimate against seemingly insurmountable odds, which lends credibility to the film, rather than having it play out like so many other sports movies.Bakula does a great job playing quarterback Paul Blake. His supporting cast is also excellent. This is a great comedy and I highly recommend it."
4,Underappreciated movie,"Yes, this movie is a cliche, feel-good movie. Yes, most of the characters are sterotypes and about as developed as a 2x4. Even with this working against the movie, I feel it still works as a movie. I laughed throughout this movie, and I still quote the movie with friends. The interaction between the two coaches is great. Scott Backula does the reluctant hero that he is so good at portraying. The characters are often times over the top, but I feel they only add to the movie. If you like sports movies, feel good movies, or the little winning one, I think you will love this movie."
4,For the football conisseurs!,"If you're a fan of football,whether it's high school,college, NFL,two of the three,or all three,this film is for you. Scott Bakula,at the time of production,the star of TV's Quantum Leap,stars as one of the players for the college football team seen in this film. Many other cast members aren't well-known,those being Hector Elizondo as one of the coaches,Robert Loggia as one of the other coaches,Kathy Ireland as the team's first and only female player and Harley Jane Kozak who's Bakula's love interest. Comedian Sinbad appears in the film also as another player. In the last scene of the film,the team,as usual defeats their opponent team. Cool film!"
3,Average at best,"I like a good sports movie as much as anyone, particularly when it involves an underdog. ""Necessary Roughness"" features a huge underdog -- a cheating Texas college forced to play football without scholarship players. With Scott Bakula as the aging quarterback and Kathy Ireland as the kicker, how can you miss?Well, the characters are paper thin, and the dialogue should be familiar -- it features every cliche ever used in the history of sports movies. Still, there is some value is seeing Ireland on-screen, and Bakula is hard to dislike. Most memorable: Rob Schneider's hilarious calls from the pressbox (fumble...fumbleaya...fumblerooski). Just don't look for too intelligence out of ""Necessary Roughness,"" because it simply isn't there."
5,Necessary Roughness,I am a Scott Bakula fan and I wanted to get this movie on DVD. This movies is just plan fun
5,Great NV for the price,"My wife got me the atn390 for Christmas. I picked it out of course. Anyway, there are a few things everyone needs to understand. First, gen 1 is Vietnam era technology. The light gathering capability is way less than the more expensive genII and genIII scopes. So, to compensate, all you have to do, is supply more IR to the target. The on board illuminator is small and puts out some IR. I purchased a LED IR light that is used with commercial security cameras. Runs on 12vdc and costs under $70. Man, catches the woods on fire!! I mounted it in a tree flooding the feeder area. I can see better than the much more expensive scopes. Another thing, forget sighting in with the pin hole cover. Wait until darkness and sight in with an open scope. Makes a difference on the POI. Doesn't make sense, but it does. Great, accurate scope and great visibility with some extra IR thrown in the picture."
1,Arrived Defective,"This scope is MUCH LARGER than other NV scopes that I have purchased. However, when it arrived I couldn't wait for it to get dark out. So as I patiently waited for nightfall I familiarized myself with the instructions. At dark, I went outside and couldn't see anything when I looked through it. The focusing wouldn't work nor did the IR light. Now, it's in the box and heading back for credit."
5,Best ever album by Frusciante,"Songs in this album mostly recorded in BSSM era, except Running Away Into You. If you are looking for a professionally recorded and mixed album, don't buy it. Cause when you first listen to it, you'll probably go like; 'what the **** ?'. ( Actually, this reaction fits 'Smile From The Streets You Hold' much )The album is recorded via a four-track recorder, using acoustic guitar, electric guitar,(even a bass which you can hear on 'My Smile Is a Rifle'), and many of backwards-forwards solos. And the way John sounds/roars/moans, which is mostly effected by heroin, makes this album unique.It's great to see how heroin effects a person's life, and it's kinda sad for die-hard RHCP fans. Thank God John is still alive.If you are into odd acoustic music, buy it. You won't like it, but buy it and take a look at it if you want to hear some real music. If you are a RHCP fan, it's sure that this album will made you cry.."
2,"If you like RHCP, don't buy this...","I'm a big RHCP fan, and always will be. When I bought this, I thought that it would be like ""To Record Add Water For 10 Days."" THIS IS NOTHING LIKE IT!!! Its hardly music. Frusciante regularly is amazing on guitar, but after this CD, I lost some respect for him. (...)The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because there are a couple cool guitar parts, but the album isn't worth buying for them."
1,No,This album is not very good. This record was made while John was a junkie and that's exactly how it sounds. He is a great guitarist and he should stick to that- not singing.
2,Shockingly No Bueno!,"I own almost every Jonh Frusciante Cd, got this one recently and could not believe my sweet ears. It's an early 90's cd, and well, he can't sing yet, maybe this was part of his learning curve? Screeching lyrics and weird explorations of the scary parts of depth come thru in the first half of the cd. My girlfriend and I were deeply disapointed. The second part is what makes it two stars instead of one. There's 13 songs without lyrics that are kinda cool. But overall in my opinion this cd is not a keeper. I'm a 4th year transpersonal psyc student in colorado, and if you like this cd, you're probably pretty weird."
2,Hmmm....,"I absolutely love John Frusciante in the Chili Peppers. On the ""Off the Map"" dvd, he plays an excerpt of ""Usually Just a T-shirt #3"" and I really enjoyed it...so I went out and bought this. And it sounds like...a guy on drugs just playing and singing nonsense. I don't buy that its ""different and artsy and blah blah blah"" It sounds like nonsense to me."
1,What the...?!,"Okay I read some of these other people's reviews, and they're real confused. This album is like a smeary fingerpainting in terms of the quality of the music, and people claiming they find all sorts of beauteous art within are frankly delusional. The only thing about this album that's beautiful is the message: Kids, don't do drugs, or you run the risk of doing something that will HORRIBLY HUMILIATE you for years to come."
2,Who the heck is Clara? And is this really music?,"Man, I was so disapointed in this CD. It is nothing like what I was expecting, John is not much of a singer, must have been all the SMACK he was on. In my opinion he never should have put this out and never should have bought it. He can play the guitar but it is nothing like what he does with the RHCP. If you want to hear a REAL guitar player then rent the movie The Song Remains The Same, turn up your sound system really loud, sit back and have your mind blown. Of course most of you may be a little to young to remember that history making performance at the Garden....Peace and wuv to you all...."
2,Niandra Lades and Usually Just Overrated,"First of I am not a john frusciante fan.This cd in what i read is john frusciante best cd up to date...maybe its that im not into red hot or john f but this sounds to forced.I think john is aiming to bad for the eccentric madman genius label that his heroes have(Syd Barret,Capatain Beefeheart).Yeah there was some moments in here that did something but other than that this is for serious hardcore everything john/red hot fans.I Got this expecting to hear more songs in the style of those seen in his heroin isolation period footage.....Hearing him drugged out of his mind screaming and doing noises like that would of made it a better album"
2,Cheap Lunacy and Babble,John Frusciante has finally gone crazy! This CD feels like John took his 4-track recordings and slapped them on a cd just for the sake of releasing something! Even his famed guitar playing on this CD is so random that it is tough to make it through most tracks. Meanwhile his lyrics that he splurges over the guitar smudges sound like a journal reading of high sqeals and mumbles. If you are looking for a great follow-up to his previous cd's this is NOT it. If you are wanting to go insane pick this up now!
5,Shirley Temple of Doom is J.Perez,"I purchased this when it was first released in '92 (?) and no one could understand what exactly it was that I liked about this album.IT BLEW MY MIND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!In the middle of the grunge explosion, here was an album of 100% pure expression, recorded on a 4-track.RAW vocals & guitar (forwards and backwards), insane lyrics (literally & figuratively), infinite in it's emotional content. Brave, daring, original, beautiful & sad.An autobiography of self-destruction.John Fruciante is a true artist and quite possibly a genius(a term thrown around WAY too losely nowadys).America's answer to Radiohead, except he's one person, and an extarordinary one.This is my FAVORITE album by John Fruciante!!!"
5,it's kinda like sex,"You have certain expectations from what you've heard in the past. It's not what you expect. The very first time is kind of awkward and uncomfortable - even scary; Don't know what to make of it - not sure if you like it. After repeated tries, you become more familiar with it, and learn how to appreciate it. Comfortable in your nakedness, you allow yourself to become vulnerable. With eyes closed, you let yourself feel the intensity and be taken away by it. Sometimes it can be so overwhelming that you're moved to tears; emotions felt are beyond words. There's nothing like it; You desire it all the time. *WARNING* - not for the easily obsessed."
3,okay but too sad to be excellent,"this album is not only john's first but his saddest cd. its not the sound quality that bothers me, its the feeling you get after listening. its confusing and mermorable. to be honest just listen to niandra la des cause the other stuff seems to be written out of randomness. top songs for me include my smile is a rifle, ten to butter vodoo, running away into you, curtains,and been insane. this album is a perfect early 1990s depression cd and of course, me being a 90s fanatic, brings up images of early 90s life i saw. anyway its like nate said, you'll love it or you'll hate it. i will say this album did bring me some tears."
3,It's an OK Pillow,"Ordered this pillow for my wife since she is having neck pain. She has been using it for about 2 months and she seems to think that the pillow is alright, and the pain during the evening has subsided some, but the pillow is a little uncomfortable. She has had a hard time getting used it. It's a little too hard, and too high. She seems to think that the Foam pillows which contours to your head might be better. Just last night she threw the pillow off the bed and said ""this pillow sucks!"" Oh well, can't say I didn't try."
4,pretty great pillow,"It took a few days, but now I've adjusted to the new pillow. I'd recommend thispillow to anyone, especially with a bad neck."
3,Obus Forme Neck and 4 in 1 Cervical pillow,I have alot of shoulder and neck problems and this pillow has replaced my old one that was pretty worn out and not helping me anymore. This pillow is high but think in time it will flatten down and be better then but is a good pillow all in all. I have fibromyalgia and buy these kind of pillows to help relieve my pain. My friends call me the pillow queen since I have tried so many!!
5,Movie,"This movie was very exciting. Ending was unexpected, and the relationship between the father and daughter completely changed for the better."
5,Perfect fit,"The mats that came with my small SUV were carpet and eventually wore out. Being a ""Pooh"" lover, I thought I'd try these. They fit perfectly in my Saturn VUE and make me smile each time I get in. Excellent heavyweight construction; great price."
2,"TO REBECCA of ""gotta read it""",do u think anybody seriosuly cares how akimas hair got short? or purple? seriously now. ure giving this book 5 stars because it tells u WHY HER HAIR IS PURPLE???!!!shiazasnow my opinion is that this book is very childish and has lot of plot holes. If you are reading this book beacuse of the original TITAN A.E. then DONT. if you r reading this book for fun DONT.KJ anderson never fails to dissapoint me
5,An exellent book 2 read...,"This book is honestly very well done, but u have 2 read it before u read the novel cause then you'll understand the story better... If u r wondering this book is about Akima's life before she went to work on finding the Titan or working with Korso. That is why u should read it before u read the novel. Other than that it is a really good book, and u should also read Cale's story too... You'll find some intresting parts in both stories... Have fun reading! -If u get it, which I mostly recomend, for Titan AE fans or any science fiction fans... =)"
1,Boring! PH sould be ashamed!,"I have borwed this boring book from my shools library. When I reached to the first chapter,it was so boring I almost fell asleep! Other books by her like Boys Start the War is 1000000 times better.Even if you think my reivew is not helpful, please dont buy this book!Bye a better one such as Harry Potter!PLEASE! PS The cover is the most grooest cover I ever seen PH books.If I can,I want to rate this book zero stars!"
1,Impetigo - Ultimo Mundo Cannibale,DONT BUY THIS ALBUM! IT IS AN UNAUTHORIZED BOOTLEG!!! SUPPORT IMPETIGO! SUPPORT MORBID RECORDS! BUY THEIR VERSION!
1,Terrible,"Do not buy this DVD, this DVD is not for the US - Incredible that this DVD is listed under US when it is not the vendor should be notify and or remove of selling unless is perfectly market as such."
1,Wrong geographical tech,"I'm sure this is a good movie--well done and all--but I must have misread the advertising blurb as it was not for this geographical area. I don't have the equipment to run this DVD. This made me very upset and disappointed, but fortunately, my local university could use it so I presented it to them. Beware the numbers on the case!"
1,Wrong format.,It wouldn't play in my DVD player or my computer. I guess it was recorded on european format. Wasted money.
1,Do Not Buy This DVD if you live in the US or Canada,"I was very disappointed. I ordered and paid for this DVD, only to discover when I attempted to play it that it was formatted for the UK and Europe in general. Do not buy this DVD if you live in the US or Canada. You will be wasting your money. Amazon needs to make it clear that this DVD will not play on US DVD players."
1,A horrifying interpretation of a classic piece of literature,"There are only 2 latino actors in this film of Allende's elegant classic...they play the whore and the revolutionary. Both Streep and Irons are brilliant actors, but are the farthest thing from hispanics one could find. They can't even pronounce the lead male character's name correctly! An embarassment, and a classic example of Hollywood's narrow cultural mind."
5,House of Spirits,"I saw this movie yrs. ago, very interesting the struggles of a family dynasty through the yrs. Was so glad to see it come out on DVD!"
4,"Come on, it's not THAT bad!","Granted the film lacks Latin stars, but I think Chileans don't have the stereotypical ""Latin look"" and are in fact more European looking (not that this justifies not using Latin actors). But about the movie, I was surprised at what a good rendering Hollywood did with the book. If you haven't read the book, I can say that you should enjoy the film. If you've read the book, you might be pleasantly surprised."
1,extremely disappointed....,"I did really wanted to buy this dvd. I liked the movie when I first saw it in the movietheater. But one good habit of mine is reading the comments of other buyers. Thank you guys!!!This STUPID idea of editing, changing, cutting or whatever the companies may say, with the idea of improving the movie... well, it simply does NOT improve anything at all. Totally the opposite: just spoil it. And the good feelings to see a good movie again, at your home, is completely gone.The movie itself is great! But my suggestion is (sorry amazon.com....): just rent it!!! And after that, if you still like it, then you may buy it."
1,The House of the Spirits.,"I had seen the VHS version of this movie years ago. After reading the novel and renting the DVD i found it had been shortened and it was not true to the real essence of the story at all. Important aspects of the novel are left undeveloped, the movie skips about 20 years to attribute the events that were supposed to happen to Alba, to her mother, Blanca, played by Winona Ryder. The cast is famous and their acting is okay, but the dialogue is not good at all. I feel robbed for renting this DVD, it was a real disapointment. I think I could've done a better job at providing the audience with an enjoyable film that develops all important aspects of the story than Bille August. Now I feel like i had to let everyone know to not waste their money or time on this DVD. It cannot be compared to the real story, just get the book."
2,A BAD MOVIE UNLIKE THE BOOK,"I must start this review but saying that the book is a masterpiece, an excellent novel, where we can read and live the words of the author, Isabel Allende.In the movie, I regret to say, fail to capture the magic of the book.Unfortunately the Writer/Director was not able to transmit into the film the vivid story, essence and the true mining of what this book as all about.There are great performances in this DVD, although, I will highly recommend, if you are willing to spend your money, you might as well get the hard cover instead of this terrible adaptation of a magnificent novel."
5,The House of The Spirits - AMAZING EXPERIENCE!,"If you enjoy movies, and if you are fortunate, every once in awhile a film comes along that will grab you by your imagination and lead you down a path of sheer enjoyment. Such it is with The House of The Spirits. A superb, once-in-a-lifetime, cast & film storytelling at it's best! Rent (or buy as I did) it, pop some popcorn, take the phone off the hook, send the youngsters to their rooms...and enjoy."
3,Where is the 1.85:1? version,I cannot believe that Artisan states that the film is in its original 1.85:1 ratio but instead gives us a 1.33:1 version. The description is totally inaccurate.
2,Why did these fine actors do this bad movie?,"The cast list included Jeremy Irons, one of my favorite actors since ""Brideshead Revisited"" in 1982. Then there were Meryl Streep, Glenn Close and Winona Ryder. Put off by concerns about the title and my dislike of movies involving the supernatural, I decided to watch this movie anyway, believing that the top-notch cast would make it worthwhile. What a major disappointment."
2,Beautifuly filmed but rambling,"I really enjoy reading Isabel Allende in Spanish as well as in English translation. So I thought I would look at this movie of her first novel. It did not, unfortunately, captivate me.It has strange and interesting casting. This is a SLOW movie; don't wait for it to pick up as it moves along. There is some beautiful beautiful camera work but I won't watch it again."
2,Not the epic intended.,"Poorly adapted version of Isabella Allende's excellent novel. Meryl Streep is irritatingly ethereal as the book's clairvoyant protaganist. Jeremy Irons is by no means a convincing latino. The movie edits out a lot of the books good matierial, but still seems strangely tedious. This is only worth watching if you want to watch Vincent Gallo beat the tar out of Winona Ryder."
2,Know what you're getting into.,"I wish I what looked up what this movie was about before I bought it. Now, this is nothing on the seller, I got my movie in the mail pretty quickly and there was no problem there. This is about the movie itself. If you can stand scenes or rape and pedophilia, this isn't actually a bad movie. I just wish there was a cut version, because all the rape, sex, and really creepy pedo scenes could have been cut and you'd have an extremely awesome movie. However, if you're not expecting it, like I wasn't, that's all your going to be thinking about for the rest of the movie. Even when the movie starts to get better towards the end, it seems to find ways to remind you how disturbing the beginning was, and remind you of how you'll not have any desire to see this ever again. Because of this movie, I will probably never watch a movie again without looking up spoilers."
3,The DVD version has been edited and is shorter than the VHS.,"I've saw this movie on VHS a long time ago. I saw it again on DVD recently and I have noticed that it has been re-edited and shortened. In the longer version, the Jeremy Irons character at the beginning of the film is in his old age. He visits his old farmhouse with his daughter and remembers the years gone past. The movie then goes into a flashback and tells the story from his youth.In the DVD version, the entire opening scene is omitted and the story is told from the beginning. Therefore there is NO suggestion of a flashback. The edited out opening scene is quite poignant and gives more insight into the Jeremy Irons character.Decent and interesting film none the less. Hopefully the studio will release it in it's original unedited version with extras."
4,Very pleasing,"Very good movies. Not as great as the actual book, as many movies made from books are."
2,Poor Adaptation,"I never like the invidious comparisons between novels and the movies made from them, but in this case, it is hard to escape. This movie version of Isabel Allende's mesmerizing novel of the same name contains most of the same plot elements, but is sadly lacking in soul and resonance. A stellar cast and sweeping South American scenery still could not make this film more than a sub-par period piece. A pity."
5,great book,"I teach an elementary life skills class and we talk alot about cleanliness. This book is another, humorous way to present these ideas."
5,My favorite,I read this book every year and give a copy to my kindergarten kids every year when they leave. Wonderful book
2,Great Book! But Illustrations washed out,"This book is a classic, and the illustrations are magical. I was disappointed when I received my latest copy--the pictures are all washed out, as if they've been reproduced with a cheaper process or something. I suggest not buying a new copy--try to find an old one with the richness of the original illustrations."
