3,No! No! No! This just can't be a lemony snicket story!,"I read books 1-9 when I was in third grade. The next year I was highly anticapating the tenth book, I thought that lemony snicket would fail in the tenth book like a lot of authors. Well I read the tenth book and now it's my favorite book out of all of them. I gave that one a 5 star review. This book is really disaapointing. It's not that exciting, it doesn't give a lot of info about V.F.D, and lemony snicket made us endure that for 323 pages. If you are a Die-Hard fan like i WAS, get this book, you might be pleased. If you just started the series or aren't a fan. don't Don't DON""T get this book."
2,The worst end for a bad begginng,"I loved all of the books in the 'Series of Unfortunate Events' exect for the seventh and this one. I don't understand how an author can write books that are so good and keep your attention and then with the last book in the series of 11 loose all of it.And if that was the last book then I think that was the worst ending that he could have written... but on the other hand if there is going to be another book I don't know if I'll be reading it.Sorry if this disappoints you but this is a word of caution... listen to him when he tells you to put the book down, it will be your only hope."
4,LEMONY SNICKET 11,an unfortunate story with a fortunate author.a fortunate book to have a fantastic author.an unfortunate author to have to write such terrible events.a VERY fortunate read.
2,Lacks the entertainment that the other books have,"So the three children (Violet, Klaus, and Sunny) are on a runaway toboggan heading toward sea. Suddenly, they see a submarine with volunteers aboard. They want to help the Baudelaires and find the ""sugar bowl.""This book lacks the enjoyment that Lemony Snicket's previous books have. I thought this book may be better than the ""Bad Beginning."" I was dead wrong, as I think."
4,This one was better,"yep, this was was my second fav. I liked the Reptile Room the best but this one was very entertaining. I hope that the other ones will be just as good."
3,Yawn!!!,"the purpose of the book is to set up for the end of the book and introduce the medusoid mycelium. Nothing more can be said, except that a crush occurs between Klaus and Fiona and Fernald is Fiona's brother.Plot: boring!Entertainment: Fine page turner!Literature: absolutely not!Suspense: present."
2,so much worse than the others.,"i WAS a huge fan of Lemony Snicket's work on the other 10 volumes of the series, but this one just plain stinks. instead of the excitement, action, and humor of the other books, The Grim Grotto is very boring. the three supergeeks meet another supergeek, with a very annoying old man. count olaf isn't even in the book, or at least VERY, VERY little. the horribly gross mushroom scene in Sunny's mouth was totally uncalled for. the humor and adventure was missing, and instead of the hilarious but detestable Count Olaf, there was the annoying cap'n widdershins. the dialogue is boring and stuffy. the EXTEMELY boring three chapters about geeks in cave was borin'."
3,Another Atrocious Account,"When I read the Grim Grotto, I noticed that I didn't find it as good as the previous ten. I've noticed that the characters are not at all realistic, such as when Carmelita performed and sang ""M is for gorgeous"". I truly do not believe there is a child of Carmelita's age who doesn't know her letters, even if it is for comical relief. Anyway, how can Count Olaf, cinniving as he is, let a small wretched girl tell him what to do. The only thing I agree with this whole story it that, 'The Olaf' is truly a cakesniffing name. Reading this book twice, I've come to see that The Grim Grotto is a must read for someone who likes bland dialouge and odd capricoius actions. The way I see it, if it gets any worse, Count Olaf will be saving kittens from trees any day now."
5,So not Grim,"This is a wonderful installment of the series. Violet, Klaus, and Sunny go aboard the Queequeq, a submarine. As well as hints to the next book, Klaus gets his first kiss and Violet turns 15! This book is a page-turner and keeps you in suspense."
5,Grim Grotto is Great,"I recently got into this series, i cannot believe how good this series is. The Grim Grotto is a wonderful book for all ages. I cannot wait until the 12th book. The Grim Grotto picks up the pace and brings the children on a trip that they can never go back from! Enjoy this book! It is a great read for anyone!"
4,Gr8 story line,Great story line. I like how Snicket was able to pinpoint specific areas that held the reader with suspense. Can't wait to get the next edition!
4,Summer reading,Purchased for my Grandson. He has almost finished the whole set. Needed this one because he couldn't find it in the school library.
5,I'm lovin' it!,"Unfornutate Events are the best books that I've read. I love the tragicomic events that those books are, and, even reading all the Olaf's persues in order to kill the Baudelaires and their surprising escapes, I think I'd read a hundred more books of this collection. As the 11th book hasn't arrived in Brazil, I read it in English. I have a certain fluency in English, but this way of writing is wonderful! I never ever would think how easy is this book reading! If you're a foreign who's studying Snicket's language, this book is the best option. The images are wonderful, and the humor hidden in the suspense and even the terror makes the history get more involving, and stucks you in front of this little book. I'll recommend it until I meet Jesus."
5,Grim Grotto,"I enjoyed this book like the others. I was disappointed in Fiona. This book is worth reading. I was upset that you couldn't find out about the next book through the letters in the back. I have found out, though that the next book is indeed called ""The Heinous Hotel."" If you would like to read what the back cover, the introduction, and the first 5 chapters are, you can view them at this link: http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2195585/1/"
3,The Grim Grotto,This book is really good.Although it is not my favorite Snicket book it has one of the most suspenceful parts out of all the Snicket books.This time the orphans are underwater and once again Count Olaf is on their tail.The ending may suprise you and will definetly leave you geussing!
1,Horrific,"If you value your happiness, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. It details the horrible plight of the saddest trio of orphans I've ever seen. In reading this book, I was alternately in tears and dispondent. Here, ""alternately"" means both unhappy and upset. You would be better off reading a book about the effects of greenhouse gasses on the water cycle. Here, ""greenhouse gasses"" refers to the byproduct of a dull chemical reaction which effects the environment. This effect, while unfortunate, is a breath of fresh air in comparison to the depressing plight of the sad, sad Baudelaires. We can only hope that the tables will be turned with this new installment, and no one will have to read about the shocking misfortunes of the Baudelaires ever again."
1,This Book is Going to Be TERRIBLE!,"I've read all the other books in this series and I find them dry, repetitive, and boring. Lemony Snicket also has many opportunities to make the story more interesting but he always doesn't! Please, spend your money on something that you won't regret getting after you've gotten it!"
2,Not so good,"The books in this series are formulaic and boring. However, I find it hard to just leave a story. I always want to know what happens. I can understand that some people like this style of book. So, go ahead and read this book, but check it out from a library, don't pay for it."
5,Excellent,"I've read A Series of Unfortunate Events books 1-11 and this was the best of them all. Though my opinions may change when I read book 12. This book was the most exciting. I've read it at school and I couldn't put it down except when I had to do classwork. In math class on the 2nd day which I finished it, I felt bored the rest of the day. Because there was nothing to read. Lemony Snicket is an excellent writer."
2,"""Grim"" is right...","As an adult, die-hard fan of the Lemony Snicket series, I'm having a reeeaaaallly hard time even getting halfway through Book the Eleventh. After last year's stunning ""Slippery Slope,"" Daniel Handler seems to be treading water here, dragging things out so that he can make it to Book the Thirteenth, as is planned. But there's nothing in this ""Grotto"" worth much of anyone's time. No new interesting characters (some annoying ones, however); and Olaf and Esme's delicious devilry is put to little use. I'll slog through to the end somehow, but it ain't gonna be easy."
4,it's all coming together now,"Absolutely loved this latest installment. I loved Klaus' ill-fated connection with the mysterious Fiona, the crisis with the mushrooms, Captain Widdershins, and above all the last couple of chapters, when the bigger mysteries of VFD finally begin coming together. The ending is probably the single best ending to a SOUE book yet -- and has me wanting to go back through all the books to find every past reference Lemony Snicket has made to his family, or to marmosets. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because I thought the repeated jokes about the water cycle being dull were repeated often enough to stop being jokes and start being dull. But I loved just about everything else.When is the next one out? I can't wait to find out what happens at the Hotel Denouement --"
4,"This book was good, but there were some minor issues","This book was not as good as the previous one, the Slippery Slope, Count Olaf was in this book for only a couple chapters. I think he is one of the major charactors in the series. Although, it contained some interesting information, and some pretty puzzling questions like: who people are? and how does this work? I think this book is more of an information provider than one of the traditional books Lemony Snicket writes. I think that this book is a good book if you like the series of unfortunate events series. But if you have not read the rest of the books it may get confusing and make you not want to read it. Although the adventures the Baudelaires encounter in this book are quite interesting I recommend that you read all the other books in the series first"
2,Bok the 11th is book the dullzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,I will give every other of this seris 5 stars but this book really was dull and boring. Capn widdershins is a bfb (big fat bore) and there is no plot whatsoever. it smells. no good work lemony.
3,A Series of SUPRISING events,"This book is perhaps a really good one, but sometimes, the plot gets to boring. It gets intresting when your past chapter one and this book takes you on a really intresting ride. The events are humurous and scary at the same time.The Baudelaire Orphans are sailing in a submaring with Captain Widdershins and his daughter, Fiona on a mission to find a sugar bowl. Why? Because there is something inside the sugar bowl that is important. What you encounter in this book are really intresting.But I have to say, it's okay"
3,The Grim Grotto,"The Bauldelaire ophans continue their miserable adventure in the newest book in A Series Of Unfortunate Events. When the story begins, they find themselves trapped on a floating toboggan in the middle of the Stricken Stream. Eventually, they are washed downstream to the sea, where they encounter a submarine, the Queequeg, and its crew. The crew consists of Captain Widdershins, who is extremely fond of saying the word ""aye""; and his stepdaughter Fiono, who loves to read about mushrooms; and Phil, the cook. They met him long ago when they were at Lucky Smells Lumbermill. Captain Widdershins is searching for the lost suar bowl, determined that it will not fall into the hands of Count Olaf and his evil associates."
3,Good,It's was an ok book but by the 10th chapter you could tell what was going to happen in the end. I would recommend this book for people who like mysterious adventures
3,It was good,The nook was good but a little bit confusing. It was not my favorite book but it was a good book otherwise.
3,Phew - self-titled (P-Vine),"Good, decent 1981 self-titled effort by Japanese vocalist Phew. I've heard very little about this almost unknown (at least around these parts) artist. Fortunate for Phew, she had two Can members here give her a hand - bassist Holger Czukay and drummer Jaki Liebezeit. This is krautrock? One thing for sure, it more like falls under the category of Avant Garde (but that doesn't say much, does it?). Tracks I thought sort of stood out were the CD's closest song to mainstream ""Signal"", the pop-like ""P-Adic"" and ""Doze"". See what you think."
1,Very week reception,"The clock needs to be right in a window in order to receive a signal. I have a number of radio updated clocks and the others work well inside the home. Also, some of the functions are activated with great difficulty. Also, the image implies the orb floats but it does not. The time zone has to be changed constantly (it reverts back to Pacific time). Lastly, it's way overpriced. The projection feature is the only nice thing about it."
3,Did the job but careful on cutting and cheap plastic,The kit being universal means you get a booklet of possible options. None of them are overly clear so you really need o pay attention when cutting off the tabs and assembling all the components into the layout you want. It is flexible in layout but it is like building Lego with you eyes closed.The plastic used is a pretty cheap quality. The storage bin was warped a little but not overly bad. It was a fair price and of decent quality that I would consider buying again .... other competitors wanted huge amts of money for similar product and I suspect not much better quality ...
1,Not to OEM specs,"The manufacturing is not within the tolerances of the OEM unit. There is a half moon opening where the strut rod fits through. This allows the strut shaft nut to be tightened. The opening on this unit is too large, so the shaft spins, not allowing the nut to be properly tightened. It happened on both the left and right side. 97 Maxima. I'm not a happy camper...."
3,Responsible study of Paul,"Prof. Witherington has produced an admirable companion to his The Jesus Quest (1995, IVP) that is a precise and researched introduction to all things Pauline, especially the historical setting of the Apostle to the Gentiles. The treatment is frequently slanted towards a more conservative picture of this controversial figure, faut de mieux, but nevertheless Witherington should be given credit for navigating the stormy waters of contemporary Pauline scholarship with aplomb. Both general readers and seasoned researchers will find something to enjoy in the volume."
4,Good Survey,"This author does what he set out to do with this book. He gives you a very in-depth look at most of the available research on the life of Paul. He focuses on Paul's heritage as a Jew, Christian and Roman Citizen. Then he turns to the theology of Paul, and is, for the most part, on point.This book reads a bit like a lecture, but it still moves along at a decent pace. Witherington helped me look at Paul's letters as a whole, and how they fit in the overarching metanarrative of God's redemptive plan. So, for that he deserves high praise. If you want to know more about Paul, probably more than you will ever need to know unless you are going to be a PhD in the New Testament, this is the book for you.Joseph Dworak"
4,"Better than most, but lacking advanced tips","I got this book because it had advanced info on integrating MS Access databases into web sites. In fact, after spending days with other books, I figured out how to insert the database within one hour, and it worked perfectly. No other book even came close for that task.Now that I know how to build the database interactivity, I was hoping for more advanced tips, but unfortunately the book seems to stop after that. Of course, the book covers all the basics for most users, but is actually more easy to read than the other 4 books I tried."
4,Very good book..........just takes a little time,This book is well put together. I am sure as the rest of you know that the book that comes with Frontppage 98 is .....well........ an hard to follow at best. I was able to scan through Frontpage Bible an have pages up an going for my website in just a few hours.I would call this book for starts to mid range people......someone that really already knows how to do HTML. ect would be board with this book VERY fast.But everything or just about everything is covered in this book. Pick it up if you are having a hard time with Frontpage 98.
3,"Not bad, not great","I have been wanting this toaster for a couple months. Finally the price dropped enough and I got it.There are a few points you should consider before purchasing.1. It toasts well and the oven function is great.2. I have had this item for about two months now and it is working fine.3. When trying to manually eject the toast, it is quite difficult but if you have your ""darkness level"" set correctly, it shouldn't be a problem.4. The door is a bit hard to clean. It would be helpful if the door would actually come off to allow for better cleaning.Over all I would say this a fine toaster. Let's face it, it is a toaster, not a computer."
5,Hamilton Beach Toastation,"This little fella is great!!!! Space saving, convenient and a pleasure to use. Every one ought to have one!!!!!"
5,Love It,All that I hoped it would be. I use this thing almost daily and have yet to be disappointed with the results.
2,"A tiny, useless piece of junk for everything but toast","The oven part of this thing is so small that you can barely fit in anything worth heating up. If you don't use the tray and try to heat up a hot dog, say, be careful, because odds are the hotdog will roll of the back of the wire rack (which has nothing in its rear to stop things from falling off) and into the very bottom of the machine, where it will be an enormous pain to get out again.It toasts fine. That's about it.Go for something bigger, something better designed, something that doesn't make you want to throw it from the top of a very high building."
4,Lasted 5 years with multiple daily uses!,"Aesthetically made, it cleans overall somewhat well. With spring-loaded hinges, the door slows itself before the handle-bar rests on the counter top. We really like the quiet timer on toaster settings 1-6 (light to dark for up to 4 slices of bread). For oven temperatures (200 - 450 degrees) we wish it had a timer - accidently left it on for 3 hours, luckily without any fire incident. It does burn the tops of tall items (I wish it were 3 inches higher & deeper), but we've toasted or re-heated many different items just fine, as long as they fit in the small space (10"" wide, 2"" tall, 6 & 1/2"" deep). Even with frequent daily use, this oven has lasted more than 5 years until recently when the toaster latch stopped holding & the ""on"" light doesn't work. Because of durability & simple mechanical features we'd be happy to get another one, but instead we need to upgrade to a larger size to accommodate our growing family numbers."
4,very pleased,"The product is exactly as promised. Only lacking a full 5-star because it is still quite new but I haven't had any issues yet so probably a 5-star. Very nice design, low/slim profile and very mod. The toaster on top has enough of a spin to really tweak how you like your toast. We only use the oven for chicken nuggets for our girls so this is really perfect."
2,nice in red color,"Well, I received this toaster oven today and I've used it to toast some frozen waffles. It worked alright but I wasn't impressed with the job it did. I had to put the waffles through for a second toasting based on what the users manual recommended for toasting time. I was not very impressed by the oven part of this machine. I had,evidently, misread what it said about the size of it. I guess, the old adage 'you get what you pay for' applies to this. I'm sending this back for a refund. I have found better made products at another web site or even from other makers that look like they're going to do the job that I want. Some are more expensive and some are not. I'm looking at all factors before I buy this time."
5,Hamilton Beach Toaster Oven,This toaster oven works really well. It is unusual in that it has a regular toaster as well as the oven. I have enjoyed using it very much.
2,toaster oven,the hampton beach toaster oven is to small to work very good. the toaster part work good but the oven is to small.
2,Not good,"We bought this toaster at Target about two years ago.CONS: It has never toasted evenly, with one dark line horizontally across the middle of each piece of toast, and it seems to take a long time to toast. Occasionally the toast jumps out of the toaster when it pops up due to the force of the release mechanism. It is VERY hard to manually force the toast up once lowered into the toaster, if you decide you have it on too dark of a setting. It takes two hands and a lot of force and the toast ALWAYS jumps out of the toaster when this is done. The toast darkness dial is usually stuck on our unit and it takes some force to move it. After approximately two years, the toast heater on the back side (one long horizontal bar) has a short in it and we can see a very bright, flame-like spot on it. I am currently shopping for a new toaster!PROS: It is very pretty and the oven part of the unit works well for us."
3,"sexy, it works, it saves counter space","I've repeatedly told others I have the sexiest toaster made.However, it feels like anything could crush it. Seems cheaply made and I guess that's why it sells for so little too. I got it because I had limited counter space.It works, and that's the bottom line."
5,It works,"It's red, it's narrow and fits under our countertop, it toasts and broils and bakes, it was inexpensive, it works! We've had it for about a month and it's been used 15 times or so. I recommend it."
5,Great toaster and oven combo,"I have had one of these for several years and love it. I just bought another one and was delighted that the newer model has added a red ""cancel"" button that pops up the toast if it is getting darker than desired, a great added feature to a great little toaster oven. It warms up pizza fast, handles fish sticks, egg rolls, open faced sandwiches etc. while taking up no more counter space than a small toaster. The retro design is very cool and the red model is really attractive."
2,"Stylish, but dumb","PROS: Cute as a bug's ear. Red is very nice looking. Small footprint. Nice oven-to-toaster mechanism.CONS: Everything I put in the oven part burns, as there is almost no clearance between the baking object and the top element. The toast browns unevenly and can stick and burn. Though it is chic, this item is not going to be in my kitchen for long."
1,What's the point?,"The notes are there, but every giant of the keyboard since 1950 has recorded one or the other, if not both, of these masterpieces, including (in no particular order) Evgeny Kissin, William Kapell, Martha Argerich, Arthur Rubinstein, Ivo Pogorelich, Van Cliburn, Murray Perahia, Maurizio Pollini, Leif Ove Andsnes, Jerome Rose, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Mikhail Pletnev, Claudio Arrau, Samson Francois--need I go on?--and this is simply pointless and inadequate beside them. Making this recording was like putting on Yankee pinstripes and walking out to the mound in the All-Star Game: You will be seen (heard) and people will be expecting high performance. If you don't deliver, you look that much worse in the comparison. Ms Schein would be better served, and would serve the disk-buying public better, by recording outside the standard repertory."
1,I Was Expecting Far More,"I was expecting far more from this book than I actually found in it. As another reviewer stated, it read more like a magazine article than an actual book. Writing styles aside, however, several important statements of fact as put forth by the authors were just plain wrong with some of these facts actually being contradicted by photos included within the book itself.Very disappointing. It read more like an ego-boost to the authors than a recitation of the ship & the men & the events leading up to (and following) that horrible Sunday morning in December of 1941........"
4,Coping with Alzheimer's A Caregivers Emotional Survival Guide,This book was very helpful and took away a lot of the fuilt feelings that go with looking after someone with Alzheimer's.
3,Wrone one,"Wrong size received but for the minimal price, not worth fooling with so hope I find a use for the size I did get. Had to reorder as this size showing is what I needed for my scale."
4,"great, classic manly smell","This cologne has a great, classic manly smell. Good year round for all types of events, or daily use. Burberry Touch is my favorite (it's more subtle), which i use often. But when i want to change it up, I use the Brit, which is more musky."
4,"LOVE IT, BUT NOT LONG LASTING","I LOVE THIS PRODUCT, I GOT IT BECAUSE MY BOYFRIEND LOVES IT! HE GOT ME A SMALL BOTTLE FOR CHRISTMAS BUT I RAN OUT. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT BUT FOR SOME REASON IT DOESN'T LAST AS LONG.. :-/100%AUTHENTIC"
1,FAKE / DUPLICATE perfumes on sale at amazon.com,I ordedred this perfume Burberry Brit By Burberry For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 3.3 OuncesBut to my surprize whenever my wife would use this perume its fragrance will just vanish in two hours. This is the worst Burberry perfume I ever got.I think its always better to spend some extra amount on Genuine perfumes at shopping malls rather then buying FAKE/DUPLICATE perfumes from vendors at Amazon.com. Its is total waste of your money.
5,One of my favourites - aromatic sweeter scent ...,"Burberry Brit is one of my favorites. It has a deep warm scent with a flowery finish. It is a sharp flowery vanilla + tangerine at first, then it changes to spicy and nutty, and finally - to soft flowery. I find those smells to be a great combination, because they fit almost any event - work or going out. I also got a lot of compliments on this perfume. I recommend Burberry Brit if you like aromatic sweeter scents.My 3.3oz lasts for a long time, because it is very strong and needs to be sprayed no more than twice [not to make anyone dizzy]."
1,THIS PERFUME IS FAKE,I have owned Burberry Brit before and was excited to get it for such a low price on amazon. It got to my house a few days ago. I opened it up-cheap packaging. As soon as i sprayed it i knew it was fake. SO MAD I SPENT $40!!! PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS!
5,Love this purfume!!,"Smells great!! Ordered this because I smelled it on my friend and absolutely loved it and was impressed I smelled it in the beginning of the night on her and all night long in a stinky and smokey bar I could still smell it on her after we left. Strong scent but not musky or too overly powerful, just right!! Shipped on time and arrived sooner then predicted!"
5,I am so pleased.,I love this product. I had priced this item at the local stores and it was more than twice the price. I was so thrilled that I bought 2 and still didn't pay what I would have in the department stores. I am pleased that I was able to get such a great product for so much less.
5,Love it,"When I first smelled it on the bottle, I thought It's too sweet, but then I gave It a try by spraying on my wrist, and hair, a few minutes later, It's smelled sooo niceee, also It lasts for a long time, which I prayed at night, in the morning when I woke up, It's still there. Love it."
5,"Love the smell, bought it for my wife","I love this perfume for my wife, smells great and younge and sexy....She gos through one every 8 months or so and it's pretty much the only one that she uses out of all of her perfumes."
1,PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS,"I didn't read other's reviews before I ordered this product and I should have, the stuff I got I do not believe is real it does not smell the same as my other Burberry Brit, I'm not happy I wasted my money on this! Amazon should really stop selling fake stuff unless they want to be straight with consumers and tell them they are not getting the real deal...should have known for the price I guess :("
1,Poor customer service by Tuccini,"Product was smaller than the size indicated by Tuccini, and when I registered a complaint, the Tuccini customer service representative inappropriately requested that I remove my negative review from Amazon, rather than addressing the issue at hand."
2,DONT BUY PERFUMES from AMAZON,"I bought this as a gift for my wife. She has always used this perfume and I thought this would be a nice gift at a little better price than perfumania or other retailers like Macys.But, the bottle to begin with looks fake. Cap doen't fit nicely as compared to our previous purchases for the same item from other retailers. The price was not much lower, but the product seems to be inferior. Also, the perfume smell wouldn't last even couple hours which tells me that Amazon receives a different shipment from Manufacturers which is not the same as what Macys or any other retailers would receive for Fragrances.I would never buy perfumes from Amazon in future. Spend a little extra money to get the full worth of your hard earned $$."
5,very pleased,"After seeing a few reviews claiming this product was a fake, I was apprehensive ordering it. But when I got the perfume 2 days after my order, I was very pleased to know it was NOT a fake. I even compared it to the samples I got in store. Great price, great scent!"
4,Burberry Brit 3.4 oz. Eau de Toilette Spray for Women,"This is a GREAT smelling spray. I love it. The Toilette is a little lighter than the perfume, and the scent fades quicker, but for the money, it's worth it."
3,For those sensitive to migraines:,"Burberry Brit smells wonderful, like a spicy, sophisticated vanilla. However, this perfume gives me a horrible migraine every single time I use it. So be warned, if you're sensitive to migraines or headaches, just be aware that this may be irritating to you."
2,Smells like a Perfume for the Elderly,"Smelled this perfume as a sample in a magazine and liked it. Unfortunately, when I bought it and tried it on (in addition to the sample from the mag), I began to smell like an old woman. Too bad I can't return it!"
3,description is wrong,"The item shipped is not ""3.4 fl.oz"" - the size of the item shipped is ""3.3 fl.oz"" - still a good deal I hope"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"Unfortunately I did not read the one-star reviews because I already knew I loved Burberry Brit and I figured why do I need to read about how people don't like the scent. But if I had read the reviews I would have found out that the perfume is not legit. It may be an old bottle of Burberry, but either way the scent doesn't last long at all and it doesn't smell right to begin with. And as I have been reading after the fact, returning is not possible, even though it doesn't say that anywhere on the ad.So don't buy this product. Honestly, don't by perfume online unless it's directly from Macy's, Sephora etc. Just pay the big bucks for it."
1,Beware! I received a fake.,"I received a fake Burberry Brit Eau De Parfum (3.3 oz) from Amazon LLC. How do I know it was fake? I went to a brick and mortar store that sells Burberry Brit, and they showed me all the details that were different between the authentic perfume and the one that I purchased. Not only was the perfume packaging fake, but the bottle was also fake, and the scent was similar to men's cologne. So be careful, it might be safer to buy the perfume elsewhere , even if it costs more. And when you do receive your order, don't hesitate to take it into a store to compare it with an authentic one."
1,I was warned but trusted Amazon,"There are reviews that warn this is a counterfeit product, but I trusted Amazon. This was a true counterfeit of Burberry Brit Eau de Parfum. The inside packaging included the bottle being wrapped with a picture of a girl, which isn't normal. The spout smells like body odor, and the scent doesn't seem to last more than a few minutes. BIG MISTAKE that I didn't see the note underneath the picture on Amazon's page that this can't be returned because it's hazardous material. They have no problem mailing fragrance to customers, but can't receive it in return? Can I sue Amazon for selling a counterfeit product in which they refuse returns? Time and money lost. Previously, I bought Burberry on eBay and it was counterfeit, but at least the seller issued a refund after I contacted eBay. Expensive perfume is expensive for a reason! [UPDATE: I later received a full refund from Amazon without returning the product.]"
5,Burberry Brit,"Came very quickly! Giving as a gift, so very glad for the timely delivery! Received as described!"
1,Beware - advertised for women but its for men,The title says its Burberry for Women --- but my wife handed back to me Christmas morning with a smirk - Thanks Amazon.....J
3,"good perfume, but there are tons of better ones from burberry",This perfume smells good but some of the other ones from burberry are far better than this one. Try the Brit Sheer.
3,A little too heavy for me,"I would classify this fragrance as an oriental. It is on the heavy side, a warm, spicy, heavy fragrance. It is very similar to Kenneth Cole's Reaction perfume. I would wear this in the winter, but for spring and summer it seems a bit too heavy. Not a terrible fragrance, but not my favorite either."
5,Amazing!,My favorite scent. Very mellow and clean. Nice mix of vanilla and citrus that works well for day or night. I always get compliments when I wear this perfume. Not overpowering at all. I've also purchased Burberry Brit Sheer and regular Burberry perfume before and this is by far the best one.
5,Burberry Brit for Women,This perfume is perfect for all occasions and remains with you for a long time. I would recommend this to anyone who prefers a subtle scent.
2,Not satisfied!,"When i purchsed this cologne in here had a high expectation for it , i smell it before in macys and loved it but the price was a bit out of my buget so i decided to give a shout and buy it from here and save 40% of the price ask macys. Big mistake !!! the scent is definilly weaker and not last more than 1 hour"
1,This hazardous product stinks!,"Don't buy this product! You won't be able to return it because it's considered ""hazardous"" by Amazon, and I don't think they mean the smell!I bought this perfume as a gift for my daughter, who loves Burberry Brit, but when she opened the box and sprayed some on her wrist, she knew immediately that this is not the same fragrance she has used for years.The product is not returnable to Amazon, so I have now spent over $41 for a musky stenchBurberry Brit By Burberry For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 3.3 Ouncesperfume she won't ever use. This is the last time I'll buy a fragrance from Amazon, that's for sure!"
5,My Signature Scent,"My mother bought this perfume for me two Christmases ago. At first I thought it was too heavy. However, once I started wearing it I fell in love with it. I've never received so many compliments on a perfume in my life. Men and women randomly stop me in hallways, in restaurants, and the street ti ask me what I am wearing. ""You smell so good..."" I wear it everyday now and am on my third bottle."
5,real deal,"seems to be the real deal and a great price!if you're considering this, it was a great buy for me!"
4,Burberry brit for women,"Fast delivery.Great price.Nice fragrance.I will buy perfume in smaller bottles from now on.After being open for awhile ,fragrance changed ,this does not happen with all perfume,but did for me."
3,Great smell but doesn't last,The scent is quite nice but it fades quickly and I have to re-apply a few times. It sells at a local department store for twice the price so I guess it isn't so bad that I have to use twice as much.
1,Wrong product,Product is not the one pictured. I received the wrong item when I wanted the one in the picture. Plus no returns.
5,"Gift for my daughter,","Gift for my daughter, she loves it. It took only a few days to receive it. I plsn to purchase more from thiss site"
5,Favorite so far,"This is my favorite perfume so far. The scent is a combination of pleasant and sexy, can be worn all day or at special occasions. This is the perfect scent for me, not too fruity or sweet smelling, has a bold and confident note to it."
4,"Good scent, definitely sweet","I bought this blindly, purely based on the good reviews online. When i first got it i thought that it might have been too sweet of a cologne for me, as i usually do not like overly sweet scents. I wore it today, however, and i have to say i enjoyed smelling it on myself. Definitely a nice scent, but do not buy it if you are put off by the sweeter colognes."
5,Love it!,"I despise floral scents. To me they smell ""old lady""ish. When I first got a whiff of Burberry Brit, it smelled warm and inviting. It has notes of vanilla and musk and . . . is that butterscotch maybe? It can be a little strong when sprayed on directly, but I find that the intense scent fades fast and becomes a lingering warm and sultry scent. Even at the end of a long day I can sniff my wrist and still catch a little of the Burberry Brit. A little goes a long way with this bottle - I have had the same bottle for a year! Amazon shipped it quickly, it arrived very carefully packaged, and they have a phenomenal price. I would recommend this perfume to anyone who prefers sultry and warm scented perfumes."
4,Almost perfect,"Better than the square one that came with my pump, but needed some finer filter material in the center section to get the water really clear. I just cut out some extra filter material and stuck it in there. All good now!"
4,What a long strange trip!,"As usual the arrival of a Mack Maloney novel resulting in my dropping out of life until I had finished it. Then, I'm disappointed about how long I'll have to wait for the next one.This volume finds Hawk hot on the trail of his quest to learn who he is and where he's from. Or, is there more to this?OK, so the plots suffer from recycle - the reviewer mentioning The Circle War has it right; there's a lot of similarities to it here - but whoever said we're reading this for its literary content? We read this because we like action, and we like the idea of a good guy winning.It's been said that Ronald Reagan was so effective as President because he made us feel good about being Americans again. Hawk Hunter does the same!Face it, if you've read one of these, you want to read them all!Do not miss this one!"
3,Disappointed,"I have loved the Wingman series from the beginning. For some reason Mack Maloney has decided to turn these futuristic military book series, into a science fiction project.I would like to see him get back to his original format and write more ""normal"" Wingman Books."
4,Weakest of the two-fers,"Of the ""two-fers"" Evidence has put out, this is far from the strongest - I wouldn't start here. But as an archeological collection, this is not without interest.""We Travel the Spaceways"" - the tracks here were nearly all recorded on other (available) recordings - and generally the versions on other albums are preferable. Hence, this becomes the equivalent of listening to an early rehearsal tape, and in places the sound is so low-fi that it bolsters this effect. But - ""Tapestry From An Asteriod"" - amazing. The variations on the other tracks are interesting to hear, also, it should be said.""Bad and Beautiful"" is pretty abstract - I can't get into much of it. I just don't hear a lot in it. My favorite track on there is probably ""Exotic Two"" where the chattering percussion anticipates the ""world music"" trend and approaches some kind of aggressive trance - but it's far from Ra's best music."
3,so so...,"This one just didnt work out for my husband. Maybe a good selection on your man, but not on mine."
3,Big Toy Stitched For Little Dogs,"Super cute toy and the grunter makes an awesome noise that my pup loved! Unfortunately, this big toy (18 inches) is made for little dogs. The stitching went in no time at all with my Dane pup. The whole underside of the squid just pulled apart where all the tentacles attach. I don't think I'll even bother trying to salvage it. I would definitely pay more for a sturdier toy. This is the quickest any of her toys have met their demise. I gave it 3 stars because it's so cool... but it's performance rates 1 star."
1,Brian Farren,The description of this book is incorrect.What you get in here are hand drawn diagrams(very poor) with no identification of organisms. Awful . Is this not the 21st Century? Why would you want this. They can keep their CD.
1,Not what it seems,Whilst the diagrams are very colourful and may look like bacteria .However they are not true copies of bacteria and the CD that comes with it does not say what bacteria it is suppose to be.Useable but only after a lot of extra work.
1,"Great serial, very bad transfer.","Jonathan Drake has it right in his review.Aside from the poor picture quality, the originalsoundtrack has been so filtered that the backgroundmusic drops out when dialogue stops.I have seen this serial in 35mm and it was superbon all counts. Too bad it has been ruined."
4,"get over yourself,it's a great serial made in the 40's","i never get over people who expect a movie made 60 years ago to be political correct.get over this idea that everything should be that way.the japanese had just attacked pearl harbor and were seen as the enemy. try,if you can find any, to find a movie made in these countrys during that time and you'll see that we were shown as the same kind of villians as we played them to be.this is a very good action packed serial and my boys both love it. forget this political correct junk and just enjoy the action."
2,Below avg. serial but view with caution,"This serial is in my opinion below avg.in production values/acting for this genre.Fans will probably still enjoy it but the caution involved is that this picture was made during WW2 when anger and outrage against the Japanese was the rule and not the exception.Racism may have made it easier,the Germans (read Nazis)got their share of it but it didnt seem as vehement.I have had an argument,a civil one,about many of these WW2 films with people who believe they should be burned or at least locked away somewhere (to what end they dont seem to know).My view is that they should be viewed as products of their time and do present the prevalent opinion during the war.They also served the propaganda/morale need as well.If a buyer cant watch this picture objectivly,and others like it they will probably be better off not ordering it. Again,the serial itself is below average."
5,AMAZING!,I have to say that i enjoyed this one a little more than the 1949 movie serial collection. But mainly because i thought the plots were better but both are deffinatly worth watching.
3,batman movie serial,Fascinating movie serial of Batman and Robin serial.Robin looks very young and Batman plays the bored always tired rich playboy to perfection.Look out for J.Carol Naish as the Asian evil doer.Note this was filmed during World War 2 and the film studios knew nothing of political correctness.
3,A fat racist Batman that can't fight,"The title pretty much describes the Batman of this series. Not in great shape, a cheesy $2 costume, and he can defeat one bad guy, but two at once will lay the hurt on him. Remember those old westerns where one guy throws a punch and the whole room explodes? That's the action in this series. Wild punches and no thought or coordination. Bruce Wayne is charismatic, but not too bright. Robin is worthless and not even funny. The main villain is more like Dr Evil (minus the humor) than any traditional comic book villain.A nice look at Batman of the '40s, this series doesn't really add anything to the story. It is a product of its time, complete with obvious limitations, and is not always entertaining. For serious fans only."
4,Politically incorrect,"Besides the normal fun of a serial, the politically incorrect terms used for the Japanese during the war and the wise government view of ""internment"" was shocking at first, but considering the fact we were at war with Japan and the Japanese had attacked before a formal declaration of war made the view understandable for the time. I loved the cars and dress of the time."
3,Batman 1943 serial.,"Like all those old b/w serials, each ep follows the formula of escape, deduce, chase, fight, get into a trap, paving the way for next ep's escape.Still worth having as the earliest on screen appearance of Batman and Robin.Print is good, cover design has great art."
1,childs play,i remember it as a child so the magic has gone but i suppose it was good for the time it came out.
3,Is it the real one?,"I got to see two versions of the 1943 Batman serial. One was the original, with all its racist dialogue intact. The other was heavily modified, with all racist verbalisms either removed or replaced with something else: all but one line in one of the last chapters.Someone not exposed to the original can still enjoy the cleaned-up version just for the story. But it does not have instructional value. The original could really be a good tool for discussion, on how war sentiments were at that time and how mainstream films can not now present something like this.Before I purchase this DVD, I am waiting to find out if the uncensored version has been restored. I give it the middle rating of ""3"" until I find out."
5,Politically Incorrect and Loving It!,"This serial is truly wonderful. It is so refreshing to see true human nature prevail against a modern backdrop of superficial platitudes and fake respect for other cultures, aka PC garbage. The truth is, the film is far from being 'racist' but racially aware and besides it was war time. I laughed my butt off when the forboden word 'jap' was used. I wonder what words the 'japs' used to describe white people? Anyway, the series is a must for all superhero fans and those who enjoy light entertainment."
5,Great old Batman series,"I was afraid this series would be corny and completely suck, however i really enjoyed it. Ya the costume is pretty cheesy but the series is very entertaining...Batman against the evil Japanese criminal mastermind...This series was obviously made during WWII and is awesome, not the same batman we know today, however people are killed in the show and it was done with a more serious tone. This is defiantly worth watching especially if your a Batman fan!"
2,Neither the best nor the worst,"I collect serials (more hours of mindless entertainemtn for my dollar)and having started with the ones that were most highly recommended, moved on to others. Lugosi's ""The Phantom Creeps"" is 1 star, and this is better than that (Ed Wood gave Lugosi more to do!), though not nearly as much fun as the others I have bought from Amazon. Similarly the racism is almost pro-forma because the audience expected it; and I have seen/heard more vicious anti-Japanese films and remember the hubbub after a very nasty remark in a newsreel shown as a short subject before a period film at a museum!Don't be discouraged at the slow start in the first couple of eps. It gets better!"
5,I MUST BE THE LUCKIEST GUY IN THE WORLD,"I just purchased this dvd and the picture is clear and sharp most of the time, ocassionally grainy or too bright for some shots. But overall a real nice picture. It is the uncut version. Except for chapter 2 missing the next chapter promo as mentioned by another reviewer. I have a bootleg VHS version and I had no idea there was a giant bat that is suspended over Batman's chair in the Bats' cave. This dvd shows it very clearly. So don't be dismayed by a few peoples opinion of picture quality. Some people just can't be pleased no matter how good something is. Or they just need to buy a new dvd player or tv set."
2,Uh...Um...ok...so...,"If you like Batman...and I mean a lot, then this is a good buy...but only if you want to see what Batman was like back in the days when we were still fighting Hitler. I would have given it one star if it were something other than Batman. The acting was terrible, the camera work was horrible, and they were so damn racist back then (but then again, it was the 40's which explains some of it, but doesn't excuse it, of course). I wanted to give it 3 stars, but it just doesn't deserve it...at all. Oh, and Robin is a creepy looking kid."
2,Hopefully we've changed since 1943,Interesting for Batman die hards. Not for the casual viewer as the Social climate and prejudice of the time are evident. Beyond that it is a typical story with bad acting and none of the mystique.
2,So So book but not a lot of competition,"I have never seen a book which so often would reference a topic or word or idea that it goes on to explain LATER in the book or section. Weird. It does seem comprehensive but not a easy read or anything. I have read better. I am glad, though, that it is NOT JBuilder specific because I am just learning JAVA and it is good to have JAVA information rather than just JBuilder interface information."
5,Very Informative,A well structured content and a simple approach to explain the techniques that developers will need to know in order to build large scale Java applications.This book contains features in JBuilder versions 7 and 8 but also contains general features from previous versions.
4,Lots of good stuff,I was able to use a couple of the pieces of the code in the project I was working on - thanks it saved me lots of time.
1,Code examples don't work,"I have followed the instructions for the example in Chapter 11 very carefully (twice!!!) and was unable to get the program to run successfully. There is some problem with the jTreeCourses and the CoursesPanel in the jSplitPane, they don't appear on the panel when I run the program.I then looked at the code on the CD and found that it was different from the code the book guides the user to generate.What a waste of time and money!"
1,"If I could give it a half of a star, I would","Nice bright colors but horrible construction. It is not at all well-sanded as there are many, many visible areas of chipped wood and splintering. Also, one of the bolts has come apart and the screwdriver is too big for the slots in the screws. For such a great looking toy, this one is constructed so poorly that I am seriously shocked.This was definitely a waste of my money. If you are looking for a toolbox for a little one, keep looking--this one ain't it."
2,"Tooting your own horn, over.. and over.. and over..","To make it brief, I also wanted to like this book, but the more into it I got, the more obvious it became that Weber wasn't going to stop showing everyone how clever and machiavellian all his characters were.It's like someone dropped 50 James Bonds into the mix and every one of them was going to outsmart the others and let the audience KNOW it.. far too many ""wink wink inside jokes"" by the people in the story. It's almost becoming a stereotype that every female character is going to be able to conquer the universe with a pair of coconuts and bubble gum.It just got real tired, real fast, no matter what situation the characters were in, you just knew they were going to beat the stupid bad guy and save the day.Please, please go back to the old Honorverse style, where, yeah sure Honor was a kickass Navy Xena, but at least she made the occasional mistake as well and that made her human, these new characters are just nauseatingly SUPERIOR.... uggg..."
2,Tried to finish it twice,"I Loved the Honor books, so, I tried, twice, to finish this one. I'll keep it simple. A confusing list of characters talk, and talk and talk ...... for the first half of the book."
4,Important later on,A nice side story that becomes increasingly more important later on in the Honor Harrington universe. Be sure to read it after Changer of Worlds and before At All Costs
1,Weber jumps the shark,"Wow, this was bad. Poor plotting, lazy characterization, and totally unbelievable ending. Weber is a good writer, and I've read most of his other stuff, but this is just... bad. Worse than bad. Train-wreck bad.The characters behave in ways that don't make sense, situations resolve themselves in implausible ways, plot points lurch into view only to vanish without really doing anything, and the final resolution is possibly the least believable thing I've read in the last decade - including political speeches."
2,Wait for the paperback,"An avowed Honerverse fan, I picked this up as a bit of holiday reading. What the hey? Splash a little cash on myself for Xmas.Sollies, Mantys, Peeps and Erewhonese all mix it up with some interesting new characters and some background characters coming to the forefront. You?d have to be as familiar with the Honververse as the author to follow this silly mess. Another draft of two seems in order.Once again, where is the editor, or the proofreader for that matter? Weber, Flint and the rest of the incestuous gang at Baen sure do churn out some good reading ? but I think they?re spreading themselves too thin on this franchise. Weber and company ought to put the ?verse to bed for a while."
1,Worst of Weber,"I have all of the ""Honor Harrington"" books and a total of 35 Weber titles all together. ""Crown of slaves"" is the worst book I've read from him. Sorry I bought it. I only read it to the end because I kept expecting something worth reading would eventually emerge. It never did. The entire story is covered well enough in his other books."
2,not up to snuff,"for those fans of honor harrington (she's my hero), this book falls woefully short. the storytelling is a roller-coaster ride of incosistantcy. sometimes it was the taut plotlines of a harrington book. at other times, adolescent twadle. i pushed through sections of garbage in the hope of achieving better writing. after 600 pages i could take it no longer. it had become drivel.don't waste your time with this one."
2,"Good, but based more on Islam than Judaism",Be aware that although this contains some good material is covers how things were done in the Bible based on modern day Islamic traditions.
5,"Very Good, Like New","The item arrived and was in very good condition, like new. Thank you so much for the fast ship and great description, too."
5,The Ideal White Dishes,"First saw these online. Went to Macy's fine china dept. to see them in person and that was all it took. They are smart, contemporary, and stylish (especially for white dishes). The plates are beautiful and the oval shape of the soup bowls is so unique. They'll go with everything and I intend to purchase more. A great choice."
4,Uneven rim hard to get used to.,"Although I love the subtle design of this plate and they are really unique, it is hard to get used to the uneven rim. If you like plates that are perfectly round, you may want to reconsider. But if you are looking for a country charm, these are for you."
4,Not bad!,"I've watched several of the episodes of season 2. The episodes move slowly, Wallander doesn't seem in a hurry, and there is a sense that people who have too much money are likely to behave badly. They need to be watched! The actors are solid and professional. I especially enjoy the young blond policewoman... she's a beauty."
1,"Slow plot, bad subtitles",I wished I had known BEFORE I got this that it came with subtitles. With bad subtitles too. The pace is slow and with the bad subtitles it becomes a bit of a bore.
1,gypped,"Just call me a pigeon. I'm furious. Maybe the fact that this is a subtitled OV of the series was indicated but if so, NOT clearly enough. Since it is a digital purchase I assume I'm stuck with it, but so far as I'm concerned I was cheated. Rip offs like this are subtle and probably very very profitable, so watch out everybody!"
5,Great source for medieval French songs,"This book is a gold mine of French medieval songs. It has 49 songs with melodies from 13th Century France. The melodies are presented in both modern and medieval notation. There are alternate lyrics for some of the songs. The lyrics are presented in the medieval French, with translations into English. There is historical material about the music. I sing informally, and I am very glad to have found this resource that allows me to learn songs, and learn more of this history."
4,Great Deal on a great book,I found this book to be of a great value and I would much rather purchase used books than new.
3,A sleeper!,"I made this purchase after watching Bernie Mack,in ""The Original King of Comedy"",and was taken by the vibes and the music. This was his opening music for his routine,E-Funk! So far as the rest of it,well it's ok for background or a party,but nothing special."
5,nice book,great book for kidslovely illustrastionsit takes a while to figure out it is BritishLovelyWell doneNice
1,Terrible Carrier,I would avoid this model at all costs. The whole carrier is made of cheap plastic. It was missing one part. The plastic parts are so flimsy that two broke while we were assembling it. I learned the hard way that you need to spend more than $19.00 to get a good pet carrier.
2,Failed Execution,There is a great film to be made symbolizing romantic obsessions and the lengths some may go to please a partner. This isn't it. It starts and ends with a women changing their faces through plastic surgery. Everything in between is confusing and unnecessarily complex. Part of the problem is that Koreans really do look alike with their almond shaped eyes and fair skin. Another problem is that they all go from timid to aggressive in a split second. I had trouble keeping track of different characters.
1,Stupid movie (SPOILER INCLUDED),"Not worth seeing. It made me laugh but not because it was a comedy, because it was stupid. Won't recommend it to anyone. Unfortunate that I can't give it zero stars.For instance, niether character apparently has a job since you never see them at work yet they have plenty of money to get plastic surgery and live in nice apartments. Moreover, the surgeries are not done in sterile operating rooms using standard sterile techniques.But let's talk about the basic story line. Crazy women gets a face change to make her boyfriend happy but then she changes her name and ID to trick him, only to find that he doesn't love the her as the new stranger and although he still loves the old her, the gets a face change himself and makes no effort to be with her.Ha ha ha, that is funny.Maybe you must live in Korea to understand this strange movie."
3,"Sorry, I can't give it more.","This is a CD that held a lot of promise due to the literature that it contains. However, Mr. Bryan has a flute sound that is unfocused and unmusical. I have not heard recordings of these pieces in which the accompanist buries the soloist with sound. For my money, Mark Sparks has a much nicer collection of literature with better performances."
5,Beautiful and Easy to read,"I bought this deck on Amazon after reading other reviews and seeing a sample on another web site... but that didn't prepare me for the true beauty and amazing colors of this deck. The vivid colors speak as much as the beautiful stained-glass art on each card, and makes for an easy and insightful reading. I would recommend these cards to anyone looking for a deck to connect with visually as well as spiritually. This is one of my top TWO favorites (Robin Wood is the other)."
2,Disappointed When Received,"The condition was listed as ""Very Good"" but when received it was marked up with yellow highlighter along with other mark-ups. I feel the condition should have been rated lower. I have to say the book was received in a timely manner."
3,Condition,It's in good condition but I think the book was a lot more expensive than what it should of been because it's not in the best condition.
4,Very Informative and written for the novice,I have actually picked this text book up and read it many times after taking the class. It really helps you understand our world from why people in Minnesota have hot tubs to ubiquitous ideas like religion.
2,The Human Mosaic,The book was highlighted as same as the description. The book was packaged inproperly because the sender put the book in a regular package which was recieved with folded edges while the book was posting.
4,Good Alias book,"Taking place in season four of Alias, this book does a good job of maintaining the setting. Mostly the book is about Sydney and the rest of APO dealing with the kidnapping of a scientist who has the potential cure to a deadly biological weapon. The locations featured in this book are South Africa, Egypt, India, and Tibet. A secondary storyline deals with Sydney's emotional reactions to the scientist's secret daughter, her own unresolved issues with Jack and Sloane, and her continued bumpy relationship with Vaughn after the Lauren ordeal.This book is definitely one of the best APO books so far. Kirsten Beyer writes the book with emotional intensity and the characters are well-drawn and fitting with the show, except for Sloane. Overall a very enjoyable action-full story with a few hug-tugging moments."
3,Its on its own,"Have not read another like this because Gregg Hobbs is its' inventor. Given its short on the technical reliability aspects , you walk away feeling you have accomplished some serious volume of reading, but still coming out short on reliability justification. A Qualitative Analytical approach, Not a quantitative or theoretical discourse. Having attended this seminar I would recommend a serious read it but follow it up with other books on the introductory concepts of reliability he has mixed throughout his book. Testing it will be a better approach if you can get support from your corporate to go ahead with the proposed principles of testing to failure. Its a hard sell but you have to work it out."
2,Comments on HALT and HASS book by Hobbs,This book is a well written but very basic primer on the subject of HALT and HASS. The title is a little misleading since it has little technical connection to vast subject of Reliability Engineering and does not discuss enough details regarding the technical methodology of HALT and HASS testing (only very generic). The book might be used as a first reader for the busy managers that wants a quick read on what HALT and HASS is basically about but should not expect any advanced technical substance from it. The price of the book is far too high for its technical value.
3,Rather Abstract; I Find it Childish,"When Ra or other bandleaders pursue this kind of a chamber-music crossed with free-jazz approach, where a bunch of players sit around and pompously play abstract runs on their instruments with no common rythms or themes connecting the players, I have to smile at how childish the approach is, and wonder if they're serious.The music on here, especially the first two tracks, is abstract, formless, and flows through a series of sections with no point and no hook. I do like the last track, ""Spiral Galaxy"", which is a lurching atonal waltz. The sounds there are oriented around a central rhythm (and a fairly strong one at that) and therefore bear some relationship to what I think of as real music."
2,Awful Finish,"I had to buy a guitar for my little student.I have a Luna Ukulele and loved it so I gave a try for this mini guitar.However, This was like the worst buy ever from amazon.The box had a big hole as if it was poked during delivery.And the product itself was dirty as if it was either used or been in a storage for way too long time.There were also black stains on tunning knobs and the paint finish on the guitar was just awful.It does produce sound for the price, though.I will show it to the student anyway and return it if her face says ""no"".So, for kids under nine, this might work since they wouldn't really care much about paint job.I loved you once, Luna but not anymore :("
3,"Cute guitar, good brand. Poorly maintained by seller","I own a Luna (which I love) and wanted to purchase a starter guitar for my 10 year old daughter. This guitar is cute and well-made enough for a beginner. However, it arrived with the strings so loose and poorly attached that I had to have it restrung to hold a tune. That is not the fault of Luna, the manufacturer, but of the seller, who should maintain their stock in better condition. Next time I purchase an instrument, I will buy from another seller other than Austin Bazaar Inc."
5,Too Cute!!!,"We bought this guitar this year for our 6 year old for Christmas. It came in this week and it so much cuter than it even was in the computer. It looks great and sounds great. This is not a toy. My daughter LOVES mermaids and my husband is determined to teach her to play, so a mermaid guitar might just get her motivated."
1,Really bad quality,"i purchased this guitar for my daughter and I knew that this wasn't going to be the best quality, but it was awful. The product was cheaply made and it made a buzzing noise because the strings hit the frets, so my daughter wouldnt have been able to play anything that would actually sound good. Then to top it all off I had to pay to return the product. I wouldnt recommend this product and I wouldnt order it through Musicians Friend either, you shouldnt have to pay to return horribly misleading reviewed products."
1,"questionable safety for guitar, good seller took return","beautiful to look at but finish was chalky. really wanted this for xmas gift. bought lead test kit from home depot bc i couldn't find where it was made anywhere on guitar or box and was worried. 1st day result looked fine. later saw test sticks had changed color to kind of a brownish orange hue and red means lead and a slow result can be indicative of a different kind of lead than you see in the initial result. may be nothing, but i wasn't taking any chances. called luna to advise them of possible quality issue and returned guitar to seller."
3,Biography Out There...,"I haven't received this book yet, but I'm looking forward to reading it; I love Booth Tarkington's writing and affectionate (gently barbed) humor. I just finished a slim compilation of his letters called On Plays, Playwrights, and Playgoers.If you're a relative you may already know that there is a biography of Tarkington out there by James Woodress (who I believe also contributed to this memoir by Susanah Mayberry). The biography is Booth Tarkington: Gentleman From Indiana. Good luck!"
2,Idolatry,"As a distant cousin of Booth Tarkington's, I was interested in reading a biography of the man. The book left me with the impression that Booth was idolized by his own family and treated as royalty. A niece returning from school was granted an audience with her uncle. His wife (second) was very protective of him. I am amazed he kept any sense of humility."
5,My daughter and I loved this book!,This is a great book. My daughter wanted to read it over and over again. It shows the innocence of children and gives a very sweet message. Highly recommended.
4,Serve the purpose,Decently priced glow rods that serve their purpose. Great for fishing wires in the attic or other dark places.
1,If you have never walked before....,"then you might like this tape. However, if you actually like a beat in your music...run the other direction. I would recommend this to someone who has never owned a walkman and gone on an exercise walking workout. The music is from most elevator soundtracks....I would describe it as listening to a Michael Bolton cd. I have to admit that I was really in shock with the slow-jazziness of it. I had high hopes when I bought this tape....instead, my grandmother now listens to it."
2,You will definitely want an electronic piano for this work,"While there are some interesting works in this Narada collection, they will probably be a bit less ""musical"" for the new age fan...particular one that attempts to play these pieces on a standard piano. A good electronic piano, with a wide range of voicings and instruments, will provide you with a way to make these pieces (which are technically challenging enough for the Intermediate to advanced player) more pleasing to the ear. but if you're willing to experiment with many different ""sounds"", there are some pleasing moments in this collection."
5,A riveting read that gets to the heart of screenwriting,"Chris Keane is a working screenwriter and it shows. Unlike many other books on screenwriting, this one actually hooks you and lets you tap into his passion for the subject. I particularly enjoyed his re-telling of Little Red Riding Hood from the wolf's perspective. It teaches you how to think like a screenwriter. The other thing I really liked is that you get the sense that what you are reading is a caring coach, someone who wants to see you succeed, not just someone who wants to sell you something. More on Keane at his website: www.keanewords.com"
5,These work GREAT!,"This is a good item for close up work. I use it for many things, sewing, drawing, and sometime reading!The #7 is a great distance for viewing your work real well."
3,not accurately sized,"I ordered the 2XL; however, it seems to be only an adult L. It runs very small! I would recommend buying 2 sizes larger that what you think you will need."
4,Great Source of Information,"I found this book to be very informative and easy to read. I highly recommend it to anyone who like me feels a little lost when it comes to investing and financial planning. I love the clear, concise and no nonsense style of this author. I recommend all his books."
2,"There are a few nuggets here, but read it with a grain of salt.","There are a few nuggets here, but read it with a grain of salt. In light of our recent lessons learned in the mortgage markets, much of the advice seems downright irresponsible. For example:p 139 [2005 edition] ""Is the real estate bubble about to pop? While no one can answer these questions definitely, what we know from history is that there has really never been a national real estate bubble."" hmm...Much of his investing and real estate advice is shaky based on faulty assumptions like that.The book is good for its motivational factor, but please do some additional research before you dive in and follow his advice blindly."
4,"Smart, Simple, Practical, Common Sense Savings/Investing",This book is simple straight forward savings and investing advice. An easy read that is hard to put down.
4,Good First Push to Wealth,"David Bach is a good, not great, financial advisor. That being said, this book could just as easily have been yellow and black and been named ""Wealth for Dummies."" That is NOT a condemnation! This is a perfect starting point for those that want to get on the way to financial freedom. He speaks the truth, easily understood. Further reading will be needed AFTER you put his concepts into ACTION!!!BUY IT!"
2,Did it ever occurs to you?,"Hi,Did anyone ever think that by not buying the books and instead borrowing it from the library will help save some money?Especially if you are one of those people that loved to read about such topics.Did anyone ever find such authors telling you to save money by not buying wealth management or ""how to get rich"" books and borrow it from a library or friends?While you are buying up the books, guess who is getting rich :)"
4,very useful,I hope to follow some of the authors advice. There are some repetitions from his other books.
5,Great Book!,"I've liked all of David Bach's books, but really enjoyed this one. I'm probably too young to be the intended audiance for this book, but I figured if I'm young and read it, perhaps I'll get even richer! Very easy to read with lots of great ideas. I've already implemented some of them in my life!"
2,Hardly Even Worth Reviewing,"Disclosure: I have not read this book.Really, though, if you need to buy a book to tell you that the best way to prepare for retirement is to make more money and not spend it, you are beyond help. (I would also recommend going to the racetrack and betting on the winning horses.)If you fell for the magical belief in diversification that permeated the financial field before 2009, join the club--but don't spend good money for more of the same.Giving money to those less fortunate is good karma, but not basic financial advice."
4,"Little Outdated, but Insightful","While the book hit the mark on some things with the current state of the economy (i.e. the housing market), you have to read this book with an open mind and be the type of person to take lemons and make lemonade. Also, not everyone has had the luxury of living in areas where the housing market was growing by leaps and bounds. I did pass the book on to my late 20's daughter to help motivate her to start securing her financial future now before it is too late. She did enjoy and has started structuring a plan for her family."
4,Solid advice for any age,"This is my third David Bach book and I've enjoyed this one just as much as the first. Contained inside of this book is the solid common sense advice that others have written about and unfortunately many of us have not followed. The whole point of the book is to encourage people to know that it is never to late to correctly manage your finances so that you have a retirement that does include financial worries. For those who need more direction they should always consult a certified financial planner for hands on advice and guidance. All in all, another helpful book by David Bach."
2,"Rah, Rah, Sis-Boom-Bah...... yuck.","This book is just a rewrite of Mr. Bach's other Finish Rich books. The book presents methods someone could use to save for a comfortable retirement. All the ideas discussed are common sense items which can be found in many other places. The ideas themselves, without the cheerleading style, could be discussed in a book half it's size.If you need the cheerleading touchy-feely style to get you to consider the methods in the book, then you might consider buying ONE of Mr. Bach's books, the one that most applies to you. There is no need to waste money on the rest of his books... you'd just be reading about the same ideas all over again."
2,start late..finish rich..and die in peace..,"Yes...inspirational..but so what if i get rich or that is..finish rich? i wont have time to enjoy my 'fortune' when im 85 years old for example..yea ill have $250,000 in my account..BUT..I would have rather bought that sexy outfit, buy that latte, buy those jeans, and enjoyed life..than be stingy to become rich at really old age.please. this book is all we have heard from childhood on to NOW. DONt spend so much, cut back, and by doing so youll have money 20-30years from now.. well..DUH, why dont you teach me how to invest (something other than 401K) or rather..how to write a book to get rich off of?? So yea..if you want to hear it ALL OVER AGAIN..get this book. better yet..ill sell you mine..for profit that is. people enjoy your life, if all goes down to hell you can always file bankrupcy! hey..you live once. so take full advantage!!"
1,Down on Amazon,I received a very old copy of this book which was in terrible shape. I tried to make a request to return back to the shipper but with no response and no help! The book I received was published in 1992! I feel that I got a bad deal and no assistance. No support from Amazon after multiple attempts. This was a real rip off with no ability to correct the problem!!!!!Overall rating would be less than 1 star.
3,about half,"this guy bills himself as a financial genius. but he ain't. there's an awful lot of paper and ink devoted to real estate as a great investment. also washington mutual is listed as a national bank. if everyone who read this book took its advice in 2006, when it was published, they are probably a lot poorer now."
5,JESUS AND HIS PARABLES BOOK,EXCELLENT BOOK FOR READING ABOUT OUR LORD AND SAVIOR. JESUS KNEW HOW TO ADDRESS PEOPLEAND KNEW HOW TO DO IT. J. FINDLAY WAS BLESS TO WRITE THIS BOOK.
5,Music as Colorful as the Cover Art,"The tonal colors just fly out of the music. An underheard jazz masterpiece. This is a great starting point into Ra's music, and a wonderful, deep, varied album. Discographers claim this was recorded in 1956, but it's hard to believe that. The music is absolutely timeless.Great composition, great imaginative arrangement of those themes across a wide tonal pallette, great playing, and a mastering job that presents the music in all its glory."
2,WARNING! poetry only.,"These authors deserve far more than two stars, but the misleading title doesn't. Buy this book only if you're looking for collections of great poetry/essays; you'll find very few novels/novel segments in here."
3,"Norton is a good resource, but could use improvements.","The Norton Anthologies are excellent resources for anyone taking a literature class at the college or high school level. However, the selections that are placed in the anthologies seem to narrow. For example, in this particular edition, the section on Emily Bronte included only her poetry, and included only a small sentence on Wuthering Heights. If the anthologies would include more of the short story works of the authors and less of the poetry, then I feel these anthologies would prove even more useful."
2,"Should be titled ""Norton Anthology of English Poetry""","Considering that this book is meant to be a broad introduction to English literature, I don't understand why it focuses almost solely on poetry and essays. Many of these writers could be better illustrated through their short stories and novels. Teachers, I implore you to find a better anthology for this subject matter."
3,Very slowly paced...,"This is a difficult book to recommend. It's not that the book is bad. In fact, it's beautifully written and tells a nice story. The problem I had with it it that it just seemed so slow to get through. It took me 6 days to read this 254 page book. It wasn't until the last 75 pages that I really began to get interested. I'll give this one a 3 star rating with a warning to expect a slow read."
2,Not my type of book,"After reading several chapters of this book, I discovered that it is not my type of book. If you're a person who's interested in one man's philosophy on life, you may find it appealing. On the other hand, if you like a thriving, moving plot, this book will be a great disappointment. Mr. Brewer's overuse of boring and unnecessary details, made the book slow moving, and at times, difficult to follow."
1,"Sorry, but I thought it was a snoozefest","I respect all of you who have rated this book so highly, but I just don't see it. I live a short drive across Mobile Bay from the center of the action of The Poet of Tolstoy Park, and I certainly would like to say that I enjoyed the book. I bought this book to support a local author and hopefully enjoy a good, highly recommended book.Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Usually, I can tell within about three pages whether or not I will like a book. With this one, it took about three paragraphs to know that this book just isn't my style.I'm sure it's a great book for people who enjoy that sort of book, but it did nothing for me.Please don't take my review only - the trends for The Poet of Tolstoy Park certainly are promising, and I hope Sonny Brewer does well. I did like the foreword from the author, but I did not enjoy the book."
4,Comprehensive Summary of Key Succession Factors,"This book provides a concise overview of the major elements of the succession planning process. I would recommend this book to anyone assisting a small, family-owned business engaging in the succession planning process. A must read for the business owner as well!"
4,Very practical.,"The short, easy to read book offers a wealth of practical ideas for engaging a family members in the business transition process."
5,My Favourite Book Of All Time!,Killobyte is a truly well written book. I was hooked from day one. It's my favourite book of all time!
4,Read it because you'd love for this to be a reality.,"While Killobyte, by Piers Anthony, has more than a few problems with the plotting, nearly everything can be overlooked because of the imagination of the story. I didn't really care much about the characters, but I loved the game in the novel. After reading this book, I was wondering if such a thing would ever be possible. If so, that would certainly be wonderful, as you'd see if you've read the book. Anyway, if you're a fan of Piers Anthony, you'll most likely like this novel, just because he wrote it."
4,"""Killobyte"" Kills","Firstly, this is not my favorite book genre. However, on advice from a friend I surprisingly enjoyed ""Killobyte"".Piers Anthony gives us an intriguing concept of virtual reality in ""game form"". We meet heroic Walter Toland, an ex-policeman, now forced to be wheelchair bound. And Baal Curran, an introspective High Schol senior, who has retreated into a world of her own.Playing ""Killobyte"" brings them together on a journey of understanding and victory.A complete, well written story.Thanks--CDS"
2,"Disappointing read, couldn't finish it","I've read a few Piers Anthony books and really enjoyed them, and when I found Kilobyte I approached it like an undiscovered treasure. Unfortunately, this is one manuscript that should have stayed in the author's desk drawer, or at least been refused by the publisher. I tried to finish it, I've been struggling with it for weeks thinking that it would get better if I approached it in another setting or another mood, but I only get a couple of paragraphs at a time before I'm bored. Sorry!The characters lack depth, the story isn't really going anywhere, and it's not as well written as his other books. Either this is an early effort, or one that's half finished and should have been polished some more.If you're looking for a good book to get into this author, I would recommend For Love of Evil. It's in the middle of a series but can be read stand alone, and it's really, really good."
3,"A video game cant hurt you, can it?","Killobyte is the newest virtual game to hit the market. Players lock themselves into a chair equiped with sensors and a visor and enter a world of imagination. Here we meet Walter Toland, a wheelchair bound ex cop, and Baal Curan, a diabetic young woman. The two enter the game expecting an escape from thier lonely existence, but this escape may cost them thier lives.Killobyte is the first Anthony book i ever read. I had heard from friends he was the god of fantasy. As I discovered he is far from a god but some of his books are a good read, Killobyte being one of them. The book is slow at times but fast enough to hold your interest. The characters are likeable and the plot is semi believable. Anthony has a tendency to write for a young male audience and this can become annoying. Despite this drawback I recommend Killobyte for the casual fantasy/sci-fi reader."
3,Killobyte doesn't bite,"My grade = B (good). An entertaining novel with the interesting premise of using virtual reality for gaming. Good characterization in Walter and Baal and an interesting antagonist in the ""Phreak"". The idea of being trapped in virtual reality without being able to escape adds suspense to the story. The story sort of bogged down during the Beirut game due to its length but picks up later as Walter and Baal try to track down the Phreak in the Potpourri game. A worthwhile read."
5,great book,this book was more targeted to novice readers and is shorter than most of his books. i read it when i was in high school and made me fall in love for his books. it was a gate way book for me to look up incarnations of immortality and the xanth series. i think his intention was to interest readers in his writing style and sell his other books. caution not for younger readers
2,Piers Anthony Flaunts his Form Novels,"Piers Anthony has achieved great success through planting the same characters in slightly different plots. One wonders how his alacrity continues to be rewarded. After I progressed beyond the middle-school age, his works simply garnered infantile flare. They are cute, simply framed, and amusing works, but very lacking in depth and character. The most tiring aspect is the stereotypes which re-emerge in book after book. Ex: Women love horses. I was once a fan, but then I grew up"
5,Excellent price,This cream is easily absorbed into the skin and is without noticeable fragrance. The pump dispenser is easy to use and the product seems to work well.
2,boring and dated,"Some, many even of the old advertising books are worthreading. To me, this is not one of them. Just becausea book was written long ago does not mean it containspearls of wisdom.There are several old books on the subject that are worthreading more than once. There are also many good contemporarybooks which cover the same topic both in context andlanguage more relevant to today's marketplace."
3,A Life After Destiny's Child,"The two former members of destiny child LeToya and LaTavia, began auditioning young women for a new female R&B; quartet. Naty Quinones and Tiffany Beaudoin made the cut. The group, Anjel, recorded a 22 songs demo in Atlanta with the help of Jagged Edge. Unfortunately the production company which handled the group fell through and all the girls from Anjel went their separate ways. However most of the tracks of the group leaked to the internet.In 2004, Toya decided to pursue a solo career and signed with Capitol Records. The ""H-Town Chick"" --like she is called now-- started right away to work on her album. She released her first track ""You Got What I Need"" which was only available on vinyl. LeToya appeared also on Capitol artist Houston's song, ""My Promise"". That year Capitol released the Coach Carter Soundtrack and made sure LeToya was on. ""What Love Can Do"" a track produced by the Corner Boyz has been picked."
4,"Boiler water treatment- vol 1 ,Colin Frayne","A very comprehensive and understanding text related to boiler equipment and auxiliares , very good for people interested and professionaly linked in the water treatment and maintenance industrial area.Edgar WatanabeChemical EngeeneerWater Treatment Co owner in Brazil"
3,Evasive and simplistic,"Lies start with the title. The book has no info whatsoever about mini or nano reefs. Just regular saltwater aquarium info. The author even confesses to not liking a tiny tank where species selection is limited. Not a shred of data above regular tank care. Very limited species descriptions, noting in-depth. Mostly catering to expencive fish stores.On the positive side, if the book could be renamed ""reef tank for ADD patients"" it could have served a purpose. It does contain a bird-eye view of a reef tank hobby, and some aspects of keeping a saltwater reef tank. Dont buy this book if you are looking for details on how to set up a mini- or nano- reef: you will be disappointed."
5,The Simple Guide To Mini-reef Aquariums,"This book is just what its title implies. A reader could set up and run a mini reef after reading this book. Very little other information would be required to do a mini reef well. The book is fun, easy reading."
3,Camera Battery,It is good to carry a extra battery but i will like to recommend to buy it from same as your camera brand.
5,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this is so much better than chapter 6! the mixing is better, the sound is better, and speed is better. this cd gets up to 177 beats per minute. the cd starts out with an awsome intro by MC Jumper from the rave event Warp Factor, which is cool to hear all the whistles and horns. the best song on this cd is 'till the day by Blaze!. its the only real old skool track on here, but the rest of the songs have an happy melody, just put into a trance sound. this cd also features a rave protest song by Hixxy and MC Storm. hope there is a chapter 8!"
5,The best one yet,"Being someone who owns all of the chapters, I can say that this is the best one yet. Not only are the songs great, but the cd has a great vibe about it. As the series grows, it matures and evolves. When you listen to older chapters, you realize how far the genre has come. When I bought Chapter 6 I thought that I had bought the best of the series. I was upset to see that it was THE FINAL CHAPTER but when I found that it was to be continued, my emotions subsided. This is the best cd of them all. If you don't own it already, you need to. Buy this cd... NOW!!!"
5,excellent movie,"Entertaining, funny, smart, great story and great actors/actresses. I watched this in the theater and I bought the dvd. It's a wonderful movie, don't miss out!"
4,Hilarious moments,"Excellent portrayal of generation gap in Chinese community...or any communityHas a bit of a Hollywood feel, some sappy moments but overall a very good movie"
1,Unable to see it,I was unable to see the movie On my TV show Unable to show this movie on this region The TV system in Spain or Europe is different from the US. I sent back the 3 CD that I bought certified mail. From Spain
5,Great movie,"Very beautiful scenes, and fun to watch. It also takes place in New York City! I really loved the movie, very underrated. Must watch."
5,Saving Face,I love this movie and I have watched it multiple times. This a smart and well executed movie. The actors are talented and engaging. It's a great chick flick!!!
3,Great first effort,"This is quirky romantic comedy with a lot promise. I won't go into the story but this is not traditional comedy. There is no set up for some of the jokes and sometimes the punchline is a little too obvious but most of the comedy is situational. Alice Wu the writer/director makes some mistakes in her first movie but I think she does good job for someone who never went to film school. If want to see a movie that deviates from the standard romantic comedy formula, in more ways than one, this is a movie you should see."
1,"....a waste of time, & of money","...not even interesting, I bought it due to the high reviews on here? Go figure."
4,Worth owning,Very good comedy-drama with very attractive actresses. Great ending as no one has to die at the end.
4,Date night movie,This was a cute movie. A definite good movie for a first date. Good insight into that other cultures experience with the gay lifestyle. Shame does not target any one culture unfortunately.
5,Saving Face is finally here!,"A funny feel good Asian American lesbian romantic comedy that almost anyone can relate to.One aspect of the film that I really enjoyed is that Wu focused on the disparity between first generation and second generation Chinese Americans. The seemingly unbreakable barriers that needs to be acknowledged, assessed, and overcome are all too familiar to me.Being born and raised in NYC as a Chinese American, this film breaks the ice and will most likely fast forward progress and understanding for us all. I feel we needed a movie to just come out and say it - to make a bold statement deeper into the true meaning of accepting one's self. This definitely did it... perfectly. Saving Face is wonderful and highly recommended!"
5,"So rare to find a 5 star movie, but here it is a perfect FIVE!",Perfect from start to finish. Funny sweet interesting. People love this flick. Enjoy!
1,Hon Task Chair,"I owned a Hon task chair for over 30 years. The only reason I needed to replace it was that the seat padding had deteriorated. EVERYTHING else about the chair was in excellent condition. So I didn't hesitate to buy another Hon. It's the last one I'll ever buy. Although it looks identical, and the description says it's identical to my previous chair, those are the only things remotely similar. This chair is cheap, poorly made, with inferior materials. The seat padding is so close to non-existent, it's like sitting on a rock. The movements work so poorly, I won't be the least bit surprised if they stop working altogether. The best thing I can say about this chair is that it looks good. Caveat emptor definitely applies here."
3,Please be careful!!,"This is not the oral hygene rinse marketed for regular public pet use - look for CET Oral Hygene rinse. Per C.E.T. website, this is for ""in clinic use only...Intended for lavage of the oral cavity before, during and immediately following professional dental therapy"""
3,The product arrived without the applicator,I received this product without the applicator. It tool 4 calls and 1 week for Entirelypets to inform me that the applicator would not be sent and I would get a refund. Customer service was terrible. I ordered it at pawsplus.com. WOULD NEVER BUY A PRODUCT FROM Entirelypets.The product works well as I have bought it before.
4,As Free As It Gets,"Sun Ra was the greatest experimental jazz composer of our age. These spacy ""tunes"" recall John Cage, John Coltrane, and the dulcet tones of deep industrial music. Definitely not for the easily distracted or traditional type."
4,I'm not a teenager but I love teen movies.,"This one is a good one! I watched it on a plane and had to buy it so I could watch it properly. If you like 'Bring it on', this is a must-see."
4,It is good for what it is,"People over analyze everything. Its a movie about two football guys who go to cheer camp to get girls. One Boy falls for a girl but both guys learn a valuable lesson. It is funny, simple and perfect. A great movie to watch with extremely funny parts especially when they watch Bring It On. Its a fun movie, thats it."
4,Fraggle Rock!,"Ok, now I know what' you're going to say. ""Another Cheerleader flick??"" Yes, but this one is different than the Bring it On's and other brain-eating films we've been subjected to throughout the years. One, it's actually funny, and two, it's from the guy's point of view. The two main characters work together beautifully, and are pretty hilarious. ""Dr."" Rick is my only major problem with this film. He simply just looks too old. All in all, this film is great for a quick laugh."
3,A typical teen comedy,"3 of 5 stars for the teen comedy ""Fired-Up"". Two football jocks decide the best way to get girls is to ditch the summer football camp and join the school cheerleading squad for their summer camp. You got two straight guys in a camp full of teen girls. You can guess the rest of the movie. Add in the evil cheerleaders ""The Panthers"", a foul-mouthed football coach, Molly SIms as a foxy camp instructor and you got it.A good basic comedy movie. Nothing special in the plot, characters, action or filming. The DVD has the usual behind-the-scenes stuff. Easy on the brain, easy to watch."
4,Cute movie,My boyfriend showed me this movie. It's actually a really cute movie. The story line was well put together with memorable characters and quotable lines. It is a little crude at times but not unbearably so.
2,Uhh....,"...I saw it the first time when it was called WEDDING CRASHERS, except the first time around the actors weren't trying to imitate Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn. Check it out. It matches the other movie scene for scene."
3,GOOD CAST WITH LOTS OF ENERGY MAKE THIS PREDICTABLE TEEN MOVIE WORK! 3 1/2 STARS!,"While there is nothing new about this predictable teen movie, the cast keeps it from becoming stale. This film has a lot of energy and while if is certainly a formula film, it does have its charm. Olsen is kind of like a hybrid of Jim Carrey and David Spade and the two romantic leads have good chemistry, but considering the genre this film is surprisingly restrained with very little raunchy humor or nudity! If you like 'Bring It On' you will probably get some laughs from this better than average teen movie."
4,Definitely worth owning,"Most of this very long CD (originally I had the 2-LP set) is excellent. As some other reviewers note, the quality is not absolutely even, and there are a few tiresome tracks, but overall it is wonderful.""After the Rain"" alone is worth the price of the entire album. Unlikely as that might seem, I think it is better than the original Coltrane version."
5,Journey To The One,"On Saturday 21 July 2007, I had a previllage of attending Pharoah Sanders performing live with a 42 piece band with strings in Johannesburg South Africa. From this CD, he performed ""you've got to get Freedom. This CD was my father's favourite from the LP's, I was a young boy then together with ""Rejoice"", they were always played at my home until I was able to pick Pharoa 's sound in any album he is featured in. I always liked John Hicks' accompanies, his sound spreads around the other musicians and holds the entire piece of music within the its bars. This CD explains Pharoa's love of exploring other sounds like ""Kazuko""."
1,Bad product,"I also have had problems with this drive last other reviewers. I would copy files to the drive from the PC; stop the USB drive using ""unplug/eject hardware"" in Windows; take it to a different PC and whatever I copied wouldn't be there. It was simply crazy. I've never had problems like that before. This occured in both Win2000 and WinXP systems. I would stay away from this particular USB drive."
1,Sevi whistle a disappointment,I bought this whistle for my grandson about 3 weeks ago. It has had to be repaired twice in that amount of time. Truly a disappointment for a popular musical instrument for a toddler.
2,Cute but doesn't work,"I was really excited about this whistle. My one-year-old loves to toot on whistles, and I thought this would be a nice one to start on. The whistle is very poorly made. The holes are crooked, so you don't actually get a very good sound out of it. I'm very disappointed and will be sending this back."
3,"It's not quite what I was expecting, however I think it will still be useful. I had read a similar book years ago with the same","It's not quite what I was expecting, however I think it will still be useful. I had read a similar book years ago with the same title and was hoping to get that book instead."
4,A Wonderful Memoir of Struggle,"Emily Van Sickle has written a wonderful memoir of her struggle during World War II to survive internment by the Japanese in the Philippines. Interned in Santo Tomas University with her husband, Emily chronicles the daily boredom, increasing starvation, and then the unbridled excitement of liberation by U.S. troops.Anyone interested in first-person wartime stories should read this book. It adds a new dimension to World War II stories of internment--this is unlike the experiences of European Jews and of Japanese-Americans, but still gives the reader pause to wonder at the atrocities of war."
3,yoga,It is a bit chalenging for people that are not so flexible due to all kinds of physical problems but I enjoyed it and Iwish it will be in a slower pace to be able to follow more accurately.
4,Good but...,"Since I'm familiar with both artists bodies of work, in summary this is the album you expect. That's fine but usually with their genre-bending, I usually look to Neurosis and Jarboe to give me what I'm NOT expecting. The new and adventurous. This is a solid work and should fit well into any collection.Strangely I'd say that this doesn't sound like Neurosis but more like their alternative persona, Tribes of Neurot. Where Neurosis is more classically death/dirge metal, on albums like 'Adaptation & Survival', Tribes of Neurot crafts soundscapes from the recording of insects (as an example). Usually for every Neurosis release ('Through Silver', 'Times of Grace') there's a companion Tribes album ('Silver Blood Transmission', 'Grace') so I guess one can judge on their own. As a fan I'd suggest them all. Rare are artists of their ability."
4,THIS IS INTENDED AS A PARODY OF THE VERY ENTERTAINING,"SCHOTT'S ORIGINAL MISCELLANY. What's interesting is, I found it just as dip-into-able as the original. The humor is British, so if you don't ""get"" British humor it might fall flat. On the other hand, it is cheaper than the original and my suspicion is that if you enjoyed browsing Schott's, you will enjoy browsing this as well."
3,title,In the title it says female but the bottle and description say male. Typo? This description and title needs updated its confusing.
3,It does what it says,"Indeed a perfect way to use grocery bags instead of can liners. However, since the name is ""cover can"" I somehow had the impression it had a cover. It doesn't. the cover is the outside which slips down over the inside receptacle after you add the grocery bag liner. I also thought it would fit in a space for which it is too large. However, it is sturdy and useful, just not as thin and covered as I had hoped."
5,"Old forts, a mystery, villains and the like","Sneaking around, discovering what other teens or adults were up to, solving crimes, ahh, I loved this series.I read the entire series as a kid, and loved it. It chronicles two brothers and their friends adventures as they solve mysteries of all imaginable kinds. I only learned as an adult that Franklin W Dixon was a pen name used by several different authors, but the series had some great stories. I still enjoy a good mystery.Paul Buckner,author of ""From Broke to Broker, and other stories of finding financial freedom."""
5,treasure treasure everywhere,probably one of the largest succsesses of the hardy boys series a good read and no misspellings (hooray!) go frank dixon go!
3,blac haze,"this guy sound like a higher-pitched pac all over this album 2. strangely, ""cant stand me"" has a part where blac haze says 'thug life'. only brutha i known who talk bout thug life is pac himself. it was like his trademark, like da way nobody but biggie talks about 'big poppa'. i dont get why despite da fact da south been takin over, blac still aint on bet or nowhere. not even a single on da radio! he must got a real lousy label or sumthin. i heard he did ""thug holiday"" wit trick daddy and dat didnt even jumpstart his career. perhaps he needa holla at fiddy or jay-z."
5,Mystical,Informative and interesting as well as full of confirmations. Very poetic. Excellent for pleasure as well as reference and study. Definitely recommended for home library.
3,Exercises a little lacking,"This book is for those interested in an esoteric interruptaiton of Egyptian mythology. The first section of the book includes a varitety of myths which has have been re-interrupted, while the remaing part of the book are lessons for personal transformation. There is a lot of information contained in the book, but the exercises at the end of each section did not interest me that much."
3,You get what you pay for!,"Not a clear poster looks like a bad photo-copy, I guess you get what you pay for."
3,"Great concept, poor musicianship","This album is great conceptually, and does have a couple shining moments, but one can't ignore the fact that the string quartet sounds like a group of high school instrumentalists. With musicians that could play in tune, on tempo, and dynamically, this album could be beautiful."
1,What's the point?,"Uninteresting, Uninspired, Not worth my money. I wouldn't buy it in a million years..."
4,String Quartet...,"Do keep in mind, this is NOT an instrumental album created by Coldplay. This is a STRING QUARTET tribute to a selection of Coldplay's songs. I believe this is an excellent album and you'd definitely appreciate it if you're a strings person. It's all orchestral strings and accurate/precise to each song's original beats. I didn't give it 5 stars though because there's no string quartet to the song Politik :( But as everyone else, this is not exactly what I had thought it'd be, but it's an amazing album regardless. I definitely suggest you preview the clips via Amazon before buying, it should help you decide whether or not this if for you :)"
1,"Oh, no!","Unlike some of the other reviewers, I hoped that this tribute would take some artistic licence. This recording is nothing more than the ""easy listening"" version of some amazingly written and arranged music.I am disappointed and agree that a potentional buyer should sample the tunes first. Not sure what came over me when I added this to my cart, I guess I just couldn't wait for the new CD from Coldplay."
5,Breathtaking,"Any devout coldplay fan or fresh off the streets and never heard of these Brits conquering the world will be able to appreciate this beatiful rendition. This CD covers all the good songs, popular or not popular - the most moving of them all (selected primarily from Parachutes and Rush). This cd will give anyone with an appreciation for music goosebumps! Absolutely a nice compliment to any CD colelction... Something good to listen to driving on a Sunday afternoon or something to get you pumped up for your morning jog. The String Quartets ability to take all the delicate composition of Chris Martins voice and potray it so well with a string instrument is unreal. A MUST HAVE!"
2,Disappointed,"It was not easy to get to the directions on HOW to make the program work but I figured it out finally. The problem also that it goes very slow with few seconds of silence between each screen. you have to push NEXT but still the FORCED silence and lack of activity takes a toll on the interest in the program. I tried it once and stopped. I might try it again, maybe"
4,Good for kids to understand the basic NASA fuction,"This is a pretty cool movie for kid who want to know more about NASA Space Station. The moive is fun to see and I like it. It shows inside of the space ship is acutal look like and what kind of job they'll do in there. The funny thing was when Charlie want to cook, all the food and pan fly everywhere. Kid will love to see this movie. They will learn alot from there."
5,Charlie Brown- Transcontinental Railroad,This video is fabulous. Lasts a good 24 minutes or so. My 7th grade Utah History students loved it & so did I.
5,Fantastic Funny and Educational,It was interesting learning about the Central Pacific and the Northern Conneticut Railroads. It was entertaining when they added the Peanuts characters into the movie. It was depressing that the Chinese were left out of the photo of the last day when they drove in the goldenrail spikes.
4,"Loan Ben a Kite, Charlie Brown!","In Volume 6 of This Is America, Charlie Brown (The Birth of the Constitution), the Peanuts gang are asked to help out while our Founding Fathers discuss the Constitution in 1788. Charlie Brown helps with valet parking (saddling up horses) and experiments with some new games, Snoopy is the guard-dog, Peppermint Patty and Marcie serve water, Linus is the greeter, and Lucy is in charge of cleanup (and of course, complains about it!). Questions abound: should the new country have more governmental power or less? Lucy thinks the solution is to have a queen! Benjamin Franklin stops by Charlie Brown's house to borrow one of his kites for his latest experiment! Snoopy and Woodstock clown around with colonial wigs and try rowing a sinking boat (with Snoopy posing as General George Washington!). This video features a lovely soundtrack by George Winston (known for his Windham Hill collections), who plays Vince Guaraldi's original standards on both piano and harpsicord."
3,Story of first rail line across Rockies & Sierra Nevada,"Because I'm an armchair railfan, I bought this video for my children; so far it is their least favorite in the series. In telling the story, a number of colorized old photos were used; too much colorization rendered some images hard to distinguish. Also there is a bit much repetitious animation (mostly wielding of hammers and picks) during the musical segments. This video could have been much better, but nonetheless it contains a lot of information on the ""transcontinental"" (actually just Nebraska-to-California) railroad and is a good educational tool. --- Paul H!"
5,It was good.,"My 4 year old and my 6 year old enjoy this tape very much. They have learned much about the Transcontinental Railroad. This video is packed with a lot of facts, but done in a way that the children enjoy watching. I am well pleased that it is a part of our collection."
3,Factual animation,"This movie is a factual cartoon relating the building of the transcontinental railroad across our country. As a teacher, I found this video short and to the point. It is easier for young children to relate to than most of the other movies and videos available on this part of our country's history. Very educational."
2,Overrated,"This book was okay, but Secrets VI was way better, mostly because of Loves Prisoner by Mary Davidson. The plots for VII were okay, and the sex scenes were great, but after the hype (especially about Knight) I was expecting to be blown away, and it just didn't happen. I'm looking forward to Secrets VIII because rumer has it Davidson has another werewolf story in that one. Why she didn't get in on VII I don't know."
1,boring,After hearing so much praise on these reviews about Angela Knight I had expected to find her novella and this book a lot more exciting than I did. I'm sorry to report it was dull and definitely does not live up to its hype. You're better off sticking with Christine Feehan if you want to read about sexy vampires. The Lawless story was pretty good but not long enough to justify the price of the book.
5,wow,"So, I've never read a romance novel before or anything erotic. But I was in the mood to read one one day and so I picked it out from the bookstore, and the back of the book looked interesting enough. I couldn't put it down when I got home. I love this book! The short stories are awesome. The writers do an excellent job of storytelling. I would recommend this to anyone who was into romance or just wanted a good erotic read. Now I'm going to go back and read the rest of the series."
5,Hot and Enjoyable Read!,"I bought this book because of Angela Knight's short story and my enjoyment of this series from Red Sage Publishing. I was NOT disappointed. Angela Knight's story was my favorite, but I will admit to some prejudice since I have been enjoying her books and stories for a while now. It has been amazing watching how her style has evolved and Kissing the Hunter is a great story with a lot of emotional depth, particulary for a novella. If you are looking for a sexy read that involves a story line and character development, then read these stories - you will not be disappointed."
5,hilarious,"We knew what we were getting here, as we had bought the vcr tape, only to have it destroyed in Katrina. So we were delighted to find it available on dvd & enjoyed it again. We have ordered another Ray Stevens dvd & intend to have a party w/ Ray as the entertainment."
5,it was good,i will bey more from this seller. it was in grate and it look like it was new. even it had been used.
2,Not Your Santana You have Come to Love,"first the drum solo by his wife, the biggest waste of time and none music portion .. missing are many of his solid backing band thru the years like keyboardist Chester Thomas and it shows as the musicians are merely copying that of the valued missed players .. the blue ray has its moments, you cant fail as a professional musician as he to pull off something of value .. there is some value to the old tunes and some to the new but it seems cheesy Vegas show like and going thru the paces and not the soul he had for many many concerts thru the years... great pic but the sound suffers on the man himself, wheres the biting guitar ? .. buy it, yes if your a long time Santana fan like I but get a discounted used version, then your money will be well spent"
3,Not up to par,"I have been into Santana forever but have to say this concert does not have the energy that I've come to expect from Carlos, I feel that the Supernatural concert blows this show away."
4,Santana,"Great concert; not as great as ""Sacred Fire"" Santana and his band are the best!!!! this is a good buy."
2,Terrible sound,"I was really excited about this blu-ray music DVD of Carlos Santana live. I could barely contain myself when it showed up in the mail. What a let down. Whoever did the sound mixing for this disc should be fired. On some songs you can barely hear Santana's guitar work and if I didn't know better,I would say the disk was featuring the three percussionists as most of the time the video is focused on them, and they are the predominant sound. I tried all three audio setup modes, none were good. Do not waste your money on this dud."
4,Santana's best,"Very nice BD, show well performed, as all of Santana, the picture clear, nice colored show, sound excelent, you can hear all percussions and drums clear, most of presentations you can not hear because all instruments are over them, good musicians, higly recomended for Santana's fans."
5,Great Recent Santana Live Performance,This is a beautifully shot Blu-ray with great sound quality and is a very long recent (2011) concert by Santana and his band. The music covers his career. His band is superb. I love Santana taking to the crowd and they have an interview with him and a separate interview with his wife on the disc. During the performance Santana brings up a young boy from the crowd while he is playing! His sentiments about peace and harmony in the world voiced during the concert just add to his music. An absolute must for anyone who likes Santana. This disc is like being at the concert!
3,"Two Movies in One: a Great One, a Stupid One","This movie may have been foiled by its own inspiration. The premise could have had nothing in common with the Poe story aside from a single torture device and, in fact, that's exactly how it plays out. The first two-thirds or so of the film could be called an R-rated fairy-tale version of the Spanish Inquisition--and it's an effective one. The scenes between the inquisitor and Maria, in particular, are powerful and well played. As just about every other reviewer has stated, though, the end of the movie is a dud; and it ends, by necessity, with the pit and the pendulum. If that concept had been dropped and the end of the film developed of its own accord as the first part was, it may very well have been an excellent movie through to the end. Nevertheless, it's worth a Halloween weekend watch if you're looking for something a little more grounded in history than, say, Freddy Krueger."
1,Choir music cannot save this horror-drama-farce-whatever,"Very odd mix of farce, horror, love drama, New Age drama, thriller, and historical drama. Takes place at the Inquisition. The grand inquisitor (Henriksen) is very serious, but his co-inquisitors are the more unserious. In the end we get to see the great pendulum, but it doesn't play a big part in the movie. Some allusions to the real ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" too, but that cannot save this sad mix of odd ideas.The best thing is the choir music that is played at the beginning. But then again, one can listen to a CD instead."
3,Stuart Gordon has done it again!,"Loose, yet violent and bloody rendering of Edgar Allan Poe's classic is actually well made and better than I expected.Lance Henriksen is Grand Inquisitor Torquemada who tortures and kills in the name of religion. A young, innocent couple runs afoul of his evil doings and must then struggle to free themselves from his torture chamber before they, too, are put to death.The late Oliver Reed, who I still remember from Hammer's ""Curse of the Werewolf"", has a brief walk on as the Cardinal. A good change of pace for Gordon, whose previous efforts include ""Re-Animator"", ""From Beyond"", and ""Castle Freak"". Aside from Henriksen's usual strong delivery, Rona De Ricci and Jeffrey Combs are two other standouts worth mentioning. By far one of the best releases Full Moon has put out. You shouldn't be disappointed."
3,"Whips, Chains, and Alternative Lifestyles","Lance Henriksen's performance as Torquemada gives me chills; I don't think I've ever seen a better study in repression and power. Yeah, this film seems fairly dopey on first viewing, but I think it works. The gore is pretty over the top, which actually plays off the quirky humor.Oliver Reed puts in a weirdly funny performance as a visiting Cardinal, confirming my early suspicions that he would mature into a really interesting actor. The rest of the cast rises (or falls) to the occasion. Take a look. Not for the squeamish!"
1,Suckville,this movie sucks! the whole thing about it is awful. i dont know who would want to watch this movie. it has lots of nudity and lots of violence. good thing that it is discontinued. and i hope it stays that way. ill be glad if they dont start making it again. if you havent saw this movie yet please do your self a favor save your money do not rent this film trust me it is not worth it!
5,Musical excellence!,"I was fortunate enough to catch MT live in Bend, Oregon last weekend. It was also my first chance to hear the new material. All I can say is... wow! It comes across as a more refined product then their earlier albums (which I also love). For lack of a better term, a few songs almost come off as folksy pop tunes. There is not a bad track on the CD and the entire album is highly listenable. If you are looking for something new, give MT a shot... good people and great music!"
3,Hellboy Animated Double Feature Blu Ray Review Only!,"I am not here to review the 2 films. Both of which are excellent, especially Blood and Iron. I am here to tell you to avoid purchasing this disc. None of the great special features are carried over...NONE, NADA, ZIP! It is appalling that with 50GB of space they couldn't port them over. Unlike the Ultimate Avengers double feature which carried all from both discs. If you don't care for special features, go ahead a buy. The picture and sound are an upgrade, but it is a cartoon and not a big difference.BLU RAY THOUGHTS: DO NOT UPGRADE!"
4,A Prayer Before Dawn,"A Prayer Before Dawn is a jazz cd by Pharoah Sanders that I am hearing for the first time. I must say that I am impressed by eloquence of each track and the passion exihibited by Pharoah with each musical tone played on his Sax. It is a very good CD, easy to listen and captures your imagination. Pharoah has done it again. One of my alltime favorite Jazz musician, as well as a fellow Arkansan."
4,disapponted,"I gave it a 4-star, because I know it is a Sony, and when I play it on my ""big"" stereo system the sound is fabulous, but I originally wanted to use it on my Ipod. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT : I did not get on the Ipod that same full crisp studio sound I was looking for (yes I tried all the EQ settings). Too much bass to my taste. I won't tell anyone not to buy it, but mine is sitting in a corner."
4,Wings of Power,The add on is great.but the sellers here are ripping people off for it.one has it New for $79.95and another has it Like new for $64.99.I paid $30.00 NEW from EB Games for mine.shop around and you will find it much cheaper then here.
3,SO SO SIMULATOR,"CONSIDERING THE PRICE RANGES OF THIS PRODUCT AND ALL THE HYPE REGARDING THE SAME FOR THE LAST YEAR OR SO, IT IS DISAPPOINTING."
5,"Comfortable, Clean Well, Light, Cozy, Durable","I bought 8 pairs of these socks for my wife at her request because, in her words, they are the best socks she has ever owned. Those 8 pairs replaced the exact same socks she bought 4 years ago. Over time, her old socks have grayed and shrunk a bit. A few have developed holes, but most are in great shape. For perspective, my wife habitually wears a hole in the TOP of her shoe right above her big toe. (We're not entirely sure what she's doing to cause this!). These socks have survived 8-10 pairs of running shoes that each developed holes in this same way.She even prefers these to the two layer Wright sock (my personal favorite). She has long, skinny feet and says the Wright sock bunches up where the Wigwam sock does not."
1,Not like they used to be,"I've been running in these socks (not the same pair. You know what i mean) since high school x-country over 15 years ago. In fact, I haven't been able to fined any sock that can compare. Unfortunately, the socks have changed and I will have to look harder. They are far thinner and one had developed a hole after 1 or 2 uses. In the past they have lasted 3 or 4 years of weekly use. I am very disappointed in the current quality of the sock. I can't believe they have the same product name."
5,I'm hooked on his DVDs,"A friend recommended these to me. I do these at our training center but at times I just can't get there to workout. If you know absolutely nothing about KB, this is the set for you. It's 2 DVDs and the first shows you each exercise very thoroughly. He shows you how it's done step by step. Then each exercise has a troubleshooting section if you still have trouble getting it. I haven't heard of another KB series that does this. This DVD alone helped me so much improving my form.The next DVD has the 2 workouts. They're set into levels, time and whether you want music or not as well as whether you want less talk from Anthony. As you do this more, you will notice improvement in your form and endurance. I go back to this set when I need to refresh my form and need to start over from lack of working out. It's a great series."
2,Not what I ordered!,Hopefully by now Amazon has pulled the photo that was with this product...it was painted black and a different design. We kept the item and tried it out in the gym; most of the guys do not like it so we are going to modify it for use. Just a warning that you will not get what you see here.
5,A SLEEP SAVER,"I also got this for my 2 yr old when I moved him to the big bed ,before this came he would not sleep in the bed first night it came we washed it and put it on his bed he was in heaven made the transition sooo easy . The blanket does feel ""rough"" but after a couple washes its great, such a great product i'm buying two more for my niece and nephew for x-mas"
2,Incomplete report,"The 911 Commission Report is incomplete. Because of politics and the pressures to keep the US government/current administration from looking bad, there are many details left out.Very important points, which could lead to the American people actually knowing what happened and why, were not even included in the investigation.Anyone reading this report should supplement their reading with ""The New Pearl Harbor"" and ""The War on Freedom"" for further clarification.The freedoms that our ancestors and our current military personnel have fought to defend are at stake."
1,Whitewash,"The real questions that would expose the true criminals are ducked and whitewashed.This is the biggest coverup in the history.Druglords, warlords, and the men and women within our 50 states who abetted them will continue their distruction of planet earth because these 10 memebers failed to address the horrible truth.Please pay attention to Sibel Edmonds and others who have the information to expose this horrible crime not confined to OBL and 20 hijackers."
2,Feeling duped.,"I just ordered a copy of this book to enhance my knowledge of the immigrant experience (I'm a public school educator in the D.C. area and a grad student with an emphasis on urban education); however, I am bothered that the copyright date is 1997, even though Amazon places it as being 2008. I understand that it's the 10th edition, but just from my cursory glance at the book, the studies remain unchanged...and dated. I'm sure I'll glean some information from this book, but there are a number of resources and journal articles cited that date back to the 1970s, 80s, and early 90s. I probably would not have purchased this book had I known that it has been 14 years since it was written--not four as it states on this web site."
1,Unclear about this book,"I have read this book twice now and it really sounds like a made up story. Author says ""based on a true story"" but who's? Certain things don't make sense. The biggest thing is that how a grown adult would want to have anything to do with a child, especially have an affair. Almost sounds like she's trying to down play John at the same time trying not to discredit him. There are a few books out there about John that claim the same stuff this book does. Did she have a crush on John Lennon when she was young. Later on in life picked up a book, and the book became her new fantasy. Some time later the fantasy became her life. So lets go write a book using some one elses story. Surprised she hasn't been sued by the family yet. I'm done."
1,Totally untrue,"I take business trips to Pensacola all the time. Just happened to go in the hardware store the author worked at. She told me all about the meetings with John and how she can't remember if they were true or not. It was kinda funny how none of her family, who work there have, never seen John at the old surf shop except for her. Then went on about being a manic depressive and Being on heavy medications to treat the condition. Basicly by how she talked and the uncertainity of the events that took place can only lead to one thing and that is in one of her mental states she had a dream that became reality."
5,wilson and gisvolds textbook of pharmaceutical and,"Wilson and Gisvold's textbook of Organic medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry is an excellent textbook for medicinal chemistry, pharmacetical chemistry and pharmacy degree students. The book is scientifically well written and enjouyable to read. he graphic images of molecules integrate well with the written aspects of book."
1,seller lied that the book looks like new but it does not.,this seller is a lier because a claim was made that the book looks like new but it is the oldest book i've ever bought.
2,4th edition,"I have had the 3rd edition of this dictionary for 7 years and thought it was super, espically the online part. However the 4th edition is very much improved.1. you can load everything to your hard disk so you don't need the CD inplace to get the pronunciations2. the interface looks cleaner and has a better layout"
5,A thorough Study of word,"A great buy of one of the best all around dictionaries on the face of the earth, the CD ROM loaded on the computer puts it all at a few clicks of a mouse."
2,Incompatible with Windows 7 64-bit,This dictionary will not install on Win7 64-bit. HoughtonMifflinBooks.com has no updates. It was a great dictionary to use on my old system from 2004.
1,cdrom not for windows 7 64 bit,"CD is not compatible with Windows 7 64-bit operating system, so don't buy this if that's your operating system as you won't be able to load the CD. Thus, the CD's only use is as a coaster for your cold beverage. Also, publisher doesn't seem to have a 64-bit compatible CD available as an update, so you can't buy this and then somehow exchange CDs with the publisher to get a version that works on the newer Windows 7 64-bit system. Now that many of us have the Windows 7 64-bit operating system, the product description should describe this limitation and how this will only work on older operating systems."
2,Cheap,"Warning!! Not for heavy duty work,only for very light duty stuff.The tools will break if stressed a little bit!"
4,Just what I expected,"The metal parts are all free of defects and have a nice finish. My only criticism is that the plastic screwdriver-type handle (which I rarely use) is small in diameter so it can be hard to get a strong grip, and made of a fairly soft plastic, which you can feel start to twist when you need to apply some force. Regardless though, this set was a great deal and the socket wrench handle (which I use most often) is all metal and very sturdy."
3,bad shipping,good product but the shipping was as much as the product and it still took at least a week (seven Days) to get delivered. I actually bought another at radio shack because i got tired of waiting. its just sitting there on my desk. my advice after looking for batteries like this on the net is to just go get one from the store. they are usually cheaper on the net but you still pay as much usually more because of the shipping
3,It is somebody's perspective (albeit it is Gandhi),"Probably the best ""translation"" that anybody has written thus far. However, it is still Gandhi's perspective, which means the interpretation is biased to the freedom struggle. While Gita transcends the concept of duality, and compels the reader to view every element in life as originating from God, and hence important, there is significant emphasis in this book on the ""good"" and ""evil"" - which defies the core principle of Gita. Gandhi tells us about overcoming ""delusions"", however, the whole description of ""God"" is delusional, as he has written it."
2,Not having the Sanskrit verses of the Gita leaves a big hollow.,"I'd have loved this book if it had the Sanskrit verses of Bhagvat Gita followed by Gandhi's commentary. Not finding the verses of Gita in this edition leaves a big hollow.I don't think even Gandhi himself would have commented on the Gita without evoking the verses from it. So I don't see why the verses should be missing, this is disappointing to me. Actually I wouldn't have bought the book had the Sample revealed this flaw in the first place.I'd love to by an edition that fills this gap."
5,optivisors,"These are the best! I had other kinds, but they werent quite what I needed. These are great for up close work. I use them for soldering and fixing small units. I can also use them for getting out splinters. Great magnification!!"
1,Wrong part...,"I bought this a couple weeks ago for my 98 CRV back when the description said 98. The package even says 98 and newer on it but it's not the right harness. I'm sure it functions as well as any piece of molded plastic with wires attached to it does, but it doesn't fit and so this company can suck it. 1 star."
4,Great product!,I recommend this product to anyone that is interested in replacing a stock radio or deck.The color code made the installation incredibly easy and safe.
3,It does cool...,"Received this as part of a kit.While it does smell nice, and your feet do feel fresh and clean, it does not remove any callus or build up."
1,"Yo, Amazon -- this page is totally screwed up.","The 4 oz. tube of Park Tool PolyLube 100 (PPL-1) should cost something like $4-5. The 16 oz. tub should cost something like $9-10.As of January 30, 2011, this page gives $9.58 as the cost of a 4 oz. tube of PolyLube (wrong), and the picture at left is the picture of a tube of Anti-Seize Compound (ASC-1), a totally different kind of goop.This is great grease, by the way, and I'd love to buy some. But this listing leaves me utterly in the dark as to which quantity of which product is for sale here."
3,DVD yoga,Not what i really expected. I was looking for more step by step instructions around getting into the different poses and not just the quick movements of the yogi master. I also did not like that there was not a period of mediatation built into the routine. I got something out of it but only because i had been exposed to different yogi positions. Would not get it without having had some experience first.
2,pass,"I am pretty new to yoga but I already have a pretty good library of dvds. I thought this one offered a good variety of poses, it was a complete workout working on a mix of flexibility and strength. Some of it was a little difficult for a beginner cause he does not offer any modifications. He doesn't seem to practice yoga like anyone I have seen before either. When he moves into postures he bounces. He also over extends his knee on poses like proud warrior. I thought you were never suppose to do that. Most of my cd's are performed in beautiful locations, this one is in a studio. I personally feel the location adds a lot to the practice. Its very relaxing to be looking out at the beautiful beaches of Hawaii or the sands of Death Valley. He is not pleasant to look at or listen to. This was the most expensive dvd I have bought and the most cheaply made. Not worth the money."
5,Just one word: WOW!,I think this book was about the most exciting book I have ever read. It takes so many twists and turns! I would recommend this book to anyone! I loved it. I stayed the whole night reading it! It gets you sucked in!
1,Not For Beginner (for reference I may say),"This book has more than 900 pages but it is not covered with any intermediate or advanced level of exercises. 99% of the exercises were already created by the authors and saved in the CD. The learner will be asked to open those excerises and finish the last step of each exercise. Man, how the heck the learners learn the Inventor without learning how sketch first (basic)? THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS. It is for REFERENCE only. If you guys don't believe me, please try it and you will know exactly what I am talking. Money back guarantee!!!"
4,Home-Based Collection Agency,"This step-by-step guide of a home based collection agency proved to be very interesting and a very easy reading guide to follow.It has very good business plans, marketing tips etc. It shows you exactly what it takes to start up a business. I loved all the sample letters that can be used. I highly recommend this book to those who are wanting to do a Home Based Collection Agency."
3,"Some good information, but not nearly enough","While this book does cover a lot of topics related to the debt collection industry, it does not cover a single one of them in any detail. It is a very thin book that has large print.I was hoping for some hard numbers on what kind of rates are normal for buying and selling debt different types of debt, but all I could find was that the author usually charges a 25% commission.At $16.95 I suppose it's wasn't too much pay for a few pieces of good advice."
2,Fails to give enough information,"This book only provides a VERY little more than can be found in 3 minutes of searching the internet.I was highly dissapointed by the lack of significant content. It was short, generic, and I believe did not provide answers to any of the really tough questions about starting a home based collections business.I would NOT buy it again or recommend it to a friend."
3,"McGyver, eat your heart out","A collection of stories describing how Allies and Axis soldiers escaped prison camps by walking, running, or tunnelling their way out - proving that if you put your mind to it and utilise your available resources you can you the impossible."
5,gift,great gift for my son who absolutely loves mobile suit gundam. he really loves ths series and wants more of them
1,lousy service,this is the lousiest service i have ever received on anything i have ordered from Amazon or any other site.I will not be ordering again.it has been over three weeks and I still haven't received my order!!
5,One of the finest Anime ever.,"IMHO, Vampire Princess Miyu ranks up with Ghost in the Shell, Akira, and assorted selections from Miyazaki as amongst the finest anime produced. The plot is sophisticated. The fantasy is sound. The motivations are complex. The hero does not always win. For that matter, exactly who is the hero of this piece? There's moral commentary here, but the creators don't draw the conclusions for you. If you want stomping military action, guns, and violence like mister One Star review here, then this isn't the anime for you. Sure, there are some clever sourcerous battles, but that's not the emphasis here. The complete series of Miyu is 4 mini-episodes, each examining the reactions of 3 essentially static characters in different situations."
5,serenityis the key,i liked it but i watched #2 first so im a little comfused but i have #1 commingbut i defanetly recomend it
5,Best organ reference to christmas Hymns,"Majestic and fantastic pipe organ, and the organist plays to inspire these hymns the way it is played in the Cathedral. A CD that I have been looking for, I heard many records and CD's over the last 40 years, on Christmas Hymns, non I wanted, until I heard this one."
5,"PYTHONS ""10"", CRITICS ""0""!","The Monty Python Crew Rides again, and the fans love it, and the critics don't know what to make of it ..... and that's the way it is meant to be."
3,Funny,"I have not seen Monty Python's Flying Circus in quite some time so it was a pleasant surprise to catch this movie on TV recently. The product description is correct in that the movie puts togehter some of the funniest bits from the TV series to form a full length feature film. The crazy cartoons are included also. Some of the skits that I found to be really funny: 1. the accountant who goes in for vocational counseling and 2. a restuarant staff that has a mental breakdown due to a minor customer complaint about dirty silverware. Then there are skits I remember from the series that still hold up after many years: 1) the talk show host who has trouble with his guest's name and 2) the Lethal Joke. One skit that I thought was hilarious was the game show called ""Blackmail"".Worth checking out if you have the time."
3,"As a film rubbish, for laughs brilliant",As comedy goes this is brilliant. But it's just a highlight show from the TV show but re-done for a movie. To be truthfull this is not really a film. You will be better of gettting the TV show.
5,A little Python will certainly make you want more...,"For the uninitiated, Monty Python is one of the most original, funniest set of comics ever to come out of Britain. Their sketch comedy has been widely imitated but never really equaled. This DVD is a great way to get acquainted with the Pythons because you get a fair sampling of their different kinds of comedy--everything from the innuendos to the outright physical. Whenever I watch this, my side hurts from laughing at the renegade ""Keep Left"" signs and Hell's Grannies. You also get such great skits as ""Dead Parrot"" (it has ceased to be!), ""Lumberjack Song,"" and ""Nudge Nudge."" There's also a great selection of animations included. A real treat for Python fans, and a perfect way to make a newbie into a fan!"
3,"i guess, um, a remix of the TV show?","This is the best introduction to Python newcomers, besides Holy Grail.While this is still a pretty funny movie, once you've seen all the original TV episodes and sketches the film pales in comparison.Not saying you shouldn't check it out, this is a good movie but the TV show is much much better."
2,not for me,"sorry, but the feeling of immediacy of the original TV sketches really is the key for me when it comes to this material - hearing the audience reaction (not canned laughter, thank God!) is an important part of the performance for me. I'll be the first to admit that, had I never seen the TV show, I'd probably be just fine with the film versions of these skits. For a Python ""dabbler"" (i.e. greatest-hits-buyers) this disc is just fine - but I'm going to invest in the entire collection of TV originals instead . . ."
5,"Monty Python, the best type of comedy is here","Simply put, the best damn comedy the Brits have ever put together."
1,IT'S JUST NOT FUNNY,I am a big fan of Monty Python. I have enjoyed all their movies and love the Flying Circus show. All anyone one of them has to do is come on screen and I feel myself ready to laugh. That's what And Now for... lacks. Hilarious skits are recreated but something is missing.... The Pythons did not have total creative control of this movie and it shows. When I rewatch the same skits from the original show for the umpteenth time I still laugh. It just shows how brilliant they were and the fine line there is between truly hilarious comedy and irritation.The lines are the same and so are the performers but the recreations are just not funny. It's as if they were pod people from the Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Their brilliant comic souls are missing in this one.
2,Awesome but the third movie is not by monty piython and this IS called monty piython box set... not very honest MARKETING!,Awesome but the third movie is not by monty piython and this IS called monty piython box set... not very honest MARKETING. I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IS NOT HONEST MARKETING AND IS LYING TO CUSTOMERS!
5,The most messed up movie ever,"This movie is so stupid it's funny. From the sketch on how not to be seen to the Upper-class twit of the year, The outrageous laughs and the absolutley no-plot style, this movie is a keepsake even for the non-monty python fan."
4,A funny movie,"This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Even though it is just a collection of old clips from the tv show, it is still halarious movie. It has some awsome skits in it. For example there is one in it called ""how to stay hidden."" It involves people hiding behind bushes, and then asking them to step out, where they are quickly shot or burned to death by a bomb. This movie however is not for those who don't enjoy Monty Python humor. If you hated the Holy Grail then this isn't for you. If you enjoyed The Holy Grail or any other Monty Python movie I suggest you check this out."
2,DVD not coded for USA,"I saw this years ago on TV and it became my favorite Monty Python movie. Unfortunately, I was never able to find a copy anywhere in the US until I found this disk which is from England. This disk will not play in my DVD player or my PS3 because of incomparable regional coding. It will play in my computer. I would have given this 5 stars if the disk was comparable with US electronic devices. It is a hilarious show."
4,Slapstick at its loony best,"Fans of the show(Flying Circus) as well any movies they may have seen and liked in the past will like this set.The gang do their clever/wackiest in bringing about just about every possible life situation,reacted to in their hilarious romp.They bring out the down side of medevel ways literally,in a comical way that is ironically pretty factual.Other weird situations,such as a knight fighting a giant penguin on the beach can be seen here.The sexual situations are met in a bobbling sense that will have your sides ache.Some of this is a little too far fetched in the warped sense,but most all is well worth viewing,many times!"
2,Beware - not original TV sketches,Purchasers should be aware that this is a compilation of all the most famous sketches RE-INACTED and refilmed by the cast in a Movie format. It lacks the raw fresh energy in the TV versions. It's still very entertaining - but for the full MPFC punch skip this movie and spend the extra money for the original TV episodes.
2,I am very Mad,"My Package came with all the right parts for the Mini and the Tri-FIghter, But the ARC-170 is missing Every piece after step 10. They gave me a TON of pieces I don't need. Another one of my friends was, also missing many pieces for their ARc-170 and he can't attach the wing. I CAN'T EVEN ATEMPT TO BUILD IT!Also, it has been 2 weeks and LEGO still hasn't comtacted me after 2 complaints. Soon I am going to call them because I am VERY upset at them"
4,A good deal,A great deal for star wars legos. However our first set was missing an entire wing of the x-wing and we had to get it replaced. My son really enjoyed building it and was really disappointed to have to start over. Built it again when we got the replacement and was very proud. It was a really well priced set compared to other star wars lego sets!
4,Great book,My son liked this book alot. He loves apple and banana. Its large enough to fit in his lap and durable enough not to be destroyed.
2,Poorly illustrated,I wasn't a fan of the illustrations. They weren't detailed enough to make each vegetable look different to a toddler. Everything green looked like like broccoli according to my child.
5,"Colorful, encourages reading AND good nutrition",This is a very fun read. I've given it in new baby gifts to several friends and they all commented on liking the bright colors and the reminders of things they haven't eaten in years or may have never eaten before.
3,"I really like it, but my nieces don't get that much into it.","Maybe it's a little too long? Maybe the text (like many books of this genre, it just lists the words, nothing else) isn't captivating enough? Perhaps it's the illustrations? I just don't know.I do like that there's a guide in the back explaining the history of every bit of produce listed in this book (this book only mentions plant foods, so it's great for veg*ns), with a pronunciation guide.Just wish the girls liked it as much as I do. I knocked off a star for that."
4,The baby loves it!,"My little guy really loves this book- he can name all the fruits and vegetables, and pretends to eat them off the page! However, it does not translate into him eating the real thing. We also LOVE the lap size! So many board books are really too little for him to look while mom and dad are reading. These lap-sized editions are wonderful for solving that problem!"
5,Love this book!,"There is so much to love about this book. The vibrant colors, the different kinds of fruit and vegetables, and the size. The kids love to crawl around on the floor and look at everything. I use it to do colors as well as the alphabet. Sometimes I do skip some of the fruits and veggies, especially when one of the letters has a lot, due to the attention span of my kids."
4,Great illustrations and variety of fruits and vegetables,This book has beautiful illustrations and a range of fruits and vegetables starting with the letters in the alphabet.It was used for a healthy eating lesson. Many students are now bringing in a variety of fruits and vegetables and some have tried new foods.
4,Illustrations are appealing,We haven't sat down and gone through this book in detail but the illustrations are interesting to my kids and it shipped quickly.
4,"Good, but not complete","The quilts in this book are lovely, and the book is written in Mary Ellen Hopkins folksy, humorous style. The instructions are easy to understand. I made two quilts using the designs in this book and they turned out well. My only problem with this book is that she often refers back to ""The It's Okay If You Sit on My Quilt Book,"" which I ended up buying."
2,This is a bad take-off on Hunter S. Thompson,After reading this novel I immendiately went back to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail. Much better novels. The plot is thin and after awhile I could not wait to but this book down. I would recommend everyone pass on this one.
2,Same old same old,"I love the Kinkstah and have read all his other books, or should I say, ""book"". But somewhere around the fourth one (I'm a bit slow ...), I realized Hey, I've already read this book. It's been the same ever since. Nobody reads Kinky's books for the plots, since they don't have one. They read them for the one liners and the very funny Village Irregulars. Unfortunately, he seems to have run out of new material and is just rehashing the same old lines. Maybe he's been away from Vandam St too long. I don't know what his problem is, but my problem is I shelled out for the hardback, when I would have had the same reading experience if I had just pulled one of my old Kinky's off the shelf and reread it.Kinky once said something like: my readers get much more out of my books than I put into them. He didn't put anything into this one. It could have been written by an intern at Simon and Schuster just cutting and pasting from the last few books; in fact, I'm beginning to wonder, was it."
4,Haven't read it yet..,"I haven't read it yet, but it did arrive before the expected arrival date, so it shipped with great speed and I imagine it'll be pretty good. It's a Kinkster book after all."
3,I probably started wiht the wrong book. . .,". . .or at least that is what I am told. This probably is a more fun book after you already know these characters from previous adventures. That said, it was wildly funny and silly, although a poor mystery. I do plan on reading more of the books, so obvioulsy the silliness was more of a blessing than a grating characteristic. I liked this more for style than content."
2,A forced pre-quel,"As mch as I enjoyed the previous Kinky books (the earlier the better, but generally all very enjoyable), this latest left a stale taste in my mouth. Kinky is laying on the slang and puns too much, has nothing really new to say and the result is quite inane.Apart from the improbababilities(sp?) and inconsistencies with earlier books (he had a few of those earlier, but those were minor), this one reeks of a forced work, something he did not have his heart in. It might even have been done by a ghost writer who skimmed the earlier books and overdid the personality part.A must-read for all Kinky fans, but only to keep up and satisfy the curiosity, ths one is not a treasure.I'm anxious to find out whether this was a one-time laspe. Lets wait for the next one.."
2,"Not up to scratch, or just bad deja vu","As I read this book, a birthday gift, I might add, I became increasingly certain I had read it before. I have avidly read and re read all of Kinky's previous books, I have seen him a number of times on his tours of Australia, hell I even have one of his guitar picks framed and on my wall with a silver plaque. Don't say I'm not a big fan!This book unfortunately left me stone cold. Even at the end, (yes it is rather lame) I found myself saying, surely I've read this before. I was so certain, I told my wife she bought the wrong book! Only on reading these other reviews have I realised this was actually a new work. Certainly not the Kinkster's greatest.I anxiosly await the release of the next installment.This is NOT A book for a first time Kinky reader!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,One of the best books I have ever read!!!,"I love to read so when I pick favorite's they have to be pretty good. I'm from New Orleans, Louisiana, where the book is set, so I loved to read descriptions of the city in 1906. The story of Katie and Stephan was so romantic. As I read the book last night for about the 20th time, I pictured myself as Katie while she begins her life a poor uneducated girl and follow her through her days as servant for the Eagan family to her loves and losses. A must read for anyone, especially if you live in New Orleans. This book was assigned to me for summer reading but since I had heard so many good things about it I had to read it about 7 months before summer vacation, I just couldn't wait!"
5,Christmas goft for my sister,"I purchased this pendant & chain for my sister, for Christmas...she collects angels. I wanted to send her something special for Christmas, and this cameo was perfect! It even came with a little ""sack"" which had a cord to tighten the top...much like a minature version of Santa's!She loved it...great price and quality! Thank you!"
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I bought this necklace as a gift for an older woman. I chose it because I wanted something understated and elegant, not cutsey or girly looking. When I received it, I was pleasantly surprised by just how pretty it is in person. Don't let the price fool you. It may be inexpensive, but it doesn't look that way."
5,"Guardian Angel Pendant with 18"" Chain",The Guardian Angel Pendant is gorgeous. I was surprised at the quality of the pendant and the detail. Will be purchasing another for myself. I just loved it.
1,Pitiful!,"The angel is a glued on piece of plastic that looks horrible. The silver pendant itself looks poorly made with minimal detail (looks like a bad soldering job). The chain is very flimsy and the clasp is extremely small (not easy to use for anyone with adult sized hands). I will be returning this immediately, sad because it was supposed to be a birthday gift I bought because it looked nice in the picture. I now know why the picture was low quality and you couldn't zoom in! I was tricked!"
5,Nice pendant,This pendant is very attractive & was what I expected. I purchased the item as a gift and the recipient loved it.
2,Disappointing,This is an interesting story that falls apart at the end. Too much time is spent describing how the hero refuses to open his heart again. After that issue is resolved the heroine's actions become annoying. Her lack of self-preservation and good sense in the face of a real threat is frustrating. If you don't care for misunderstandings and heroines that naively put themselves in harm's way select another book.
3,Good looking but cheaply made,"The assembled product looks very nice; however, the drawer fronts don't fit tightly. The dowels are, as another reviewer pointed out, too long. I also had a few missing / damaged parts, but Prepac quickly sent replacements despite the holidays and blizzard. (I contacted the company via the email listed on the directions.)I'd have been really happy with this armoire if I'd only spent in $99 - $150 range. For $250, though, I expected more."
4,It's good,"This armoire is beautiful, it was almost exactly what I wanted. My only two issues with it are that I wish it was taller, but that is my own fault as the dimensions are listed- my short dresses don't hang completely, but it's still nice. The one thing I really don't understand about it is that the drawers don't go the whole depth, only a little more than half of it. That is really the only complaint I have about it though."
4,Prepac Sonoma Black 2-Door Armoire,This unit fits our needs perfectly.We have looked for this type of armoire for months because of limited space in a guest room whose color scheme is black and red. It was relatively easy to assemble though I had to reinforce it with angle brackets and glue it for added support.My wife and I are both pleased with the unit.Prepac Sonoma Black 2-Door Armoire
1,Too old school,This game is way too old school all the way around and I wish I would have spent more money and bought a newer more up to date game.
5,game,i bought this for my grandson he loves it he is crazy about games i love shoping with amazon very good choice
3,Spoiled by perfection !,"Unfortunately I bought the Red Hat Linux 7.2 BIBLE along with the Red Hat Linux ""The Complete Reference"". This book has been moderately useful in my day to day support of Linux. It leaves you with more questions than answers. If you purchase this book also buy ""The Complete Referrence"", it is a must. Where this book fails you TCR can answer those questions. This book is not easy to understand and leaves many holes. I would recommend it to someone who has a Very Good Knowledge of LINUX and is just looking for good reference material."
1,Never pay for anything Linux,"Never buy any Linux books, given that there are much better sources that you can find for free on the internet. I made a mistake of buying some top rated books and i regretted every time and ended up throwing to book away. I love linux but as of today there's really no good books on it and honestly you don't need it, you'll find more info the you would ever needed on the web. Remember Linux is all about freedom so be aware of anything Linux that you have to pay for."
3,I was a bit disappointed,"I am not a linux guru. I installed Red Hat Linux on one of my machines to learn linux and purchased this book to help me along the way. It appears to cover everything that it needs to, but I found the detail explinations of how to do things to be greatly lacking and on a few occasions to be wrong. I spent a lot of time trying to set things up in linux using this book as a guide, and they just plain didn't work in a great many cases. Either it is incorrect in places, or it is incomplete.In addition, it reminds me of a cook book. You just follow the instructions to do specific things without it telling you WHY you are doing what it tells you, or even why you need to do some specific thing. Because of this, it really isn't much of a resource for learning."
3,Moderately useful,"Huge book, but not a lot of meat. Technical topics that deserve full chapters get a cursory paragraph, where other ""user-related"" topics get too much attention. Is a full chapter dedicated to linux games really useful? My suggestion would be to preview the book (if possible), since it may not be useful for a more senior user/admin type."
3,Good book for starters,"This is a good book for starters, but I had a problem with 2 of the CDs being unloadable. Looked like a severe scratch or other defect on both disks.The book gives me the basics and allows me to do most anything I want to do."
3,Moderately Useful,"Huge book, but only partially useful. Technical topics that deserve detailed documentation get a cursory explanation, where other general topics that should have a small mention get entire chapters. Is a chapter dedicated to linux games really useful for anyone? If you live in area that has a bookstore carrying this title, it might be good to browse through it before ordering..."
1,Not Quite There.,"I bought this book for reference material. When I got the book the first thing I looked up was disk quota's. I went to the index and I found one key for disk quota's. (Pg 430-432). So I turned to it and I began to read. I was shocked to see what was written. It says ""A stock Red Hat Linux system lacks true disk quotas,"" This was a surprise because I am using quota's on my Red Hat system. I have used them for a long time. I don't remember if I had to load an rpm or not, but even if I did the the book should point that out and tell you how to install and set up quota's. Instead the book gives you a script that will email your users if they use more than a pre determined amount of disk space. While nice it does not stop runaway processes or users from eating up the disk. Red Hat does have quota's and they are easy to use and maintain. I don't like books that don't get basic information correct. How can I trust this book for anything else?...."
4,Expose of common Acidic cause of most diseases now,"I been studying real deep unnatural causes of disease & pain for decades, discovering that acidosis toxemia in our bodies is epidemic sic condition causing infection & other symptoms blamed on germs i call Microfobia fears of bacteria & virus. Here he exposes acidic foods, drinks & candy that combines inside our bodies, causing most diseases. This deep, simple & scientific book exposes the normal popular tasty & pollution sources inner acidic conditions. Plus healthy natural prevention & solutions, esp alkaline powder to balance out you excess acid pH. Its good intro to chemical sources of health & disease for self-help health-care."
4,an atmosphere of quiet dread,"Although the epigraph for each story is an item from the local police blotter, the stories in this book are moody, evocative, and based more in relationships than action. Some have a touch of magical realism. They remind me of stories by Peter Cameron, or Lorrie Moore without the hilarity. Most of the narrators seem to be observing, from a distance and without total comprehension, even when it's their own lives they're observing. I enjoyed the delicate balance and good writing, and the local color (I live in Portland), but there's no story in the book that I would rush out and make my friends read right away."
2,Sour Grapes,Good but not great - like one of a thousand other indictments of suburbia of the whited-sepulchre-in-a-gilded-cage variety.
1,Another of Mr COOK'S pupils,"I am another person forced to read this book by my English teacher Mr Cook and the corrupt education system. I thought this book was awful and boring it has to be one of the worst books I have ever read (which isnt many). I also think what Miss Brodie did was a disgrace and puts alot of Mis-trust is teachers and the education system in general. If my parents thought these activities were going on in my school (Marr College) i would be amediatly withdrawn from it, so i think Sandy was right to betray Miss Brodie."
1,"Mr Cook 2 , The Sequel, This Time Its Personal",I just wanted to say that this book made me wish that theyd legalise hand guns in the UK. It is the kind of book that makes little children cry. I have read more intresting stuff on the bake of crisp packets. In conclusion 9/10 phycopathic maniacs recomend reading The Pride Of MJB before going on a random killing spree.
4,Subtle Story With Tragic Undertones.,"Miss Jean Brodie seems like a teacher sent from heaven: She's witty,well traveled,and clearly interested in her young female students,so much that she chooses several to become part of her""set"" which is considered a great honor-but is it? The book slowly lets you see Miss Brodie's manipulative side as she tries to eeriely control her ""girls"" lives and forever changes them as a result. A bit episodic at times and the play(as well as movie) had a more powerful ending. Still,it's an interesting charactor study which will make you think well after you've finished it."
3,A coy bit of Spark-le,"The problem with this book is that it's so gnomic. That is, its compact style and size are, I suppose, purposefully wrought in this way so that we may come away asking ourselves profound questions on the meaning of a mentor/student relationship, social hierarchies, art, betrayal, pedagogy etc. It's, you know, like the kind of thing you get from an old white-bearded yogi sitting on the top of some Himmalayan mountain: ""The crow flies in square circles.""-Now, what's the meaning of life?The problem with this type of book is that it never takes the time (or Spark doesn't)to grab hold of your heart and mind for long enough to make you care about the deeper questions involved (and they are clearly there). Rather, it flits around like some intriguing butterfly on a lazy afternoon and then just as quickly hovers out of sight.In other words, Spark and the book are too coy by half. You forget about the lilting butterfly by nightfall."
5,Great study of human nature without one extra word.,"This book is a classic for a reason - so many class, culture and political issues wrapped up in one package."
3,See the movie,"If you are enthralled by the movie version, you probably will want to read this book to complete the experience. However, be mindful that it was written by a teenager who had yet to fully develop her novelistic skills. The movie is far better. Still, the book is a very creative endeavor by a young woman and deserves the reader's attention. The real question: How many of us had teachers like Jean Brodie, or close approximations?"
2,Boring and repetitive - Rent the movie instead !,"Boring and repetitive. The ending is given away 1/3 into the book, rendering the remaining 2/3 an exercise in redundancy. However, a screen writer managed to transform this into a rather engrossing film, due in large part to the brillinat performance by Magie Smith. Given the option, I strongly recommend renting the movie."
2,hated Miss Brodie and this book,"This is the story of Miss Jean Brodie, an eccentric Edinburgh schoolteacher, and her special relationship with several of her students. Rather than school her students in the mundane disciplines that the school requires, Miss Jean Brodie regales them with stories from her own life, instructs them in what she believes to be the finer points in life and tops it off with a laudatory recommendation of Fascism.I hated Miss Brodie and this book. She is the worst product of Modern Times, a romantic in the sense that she elevates the personal above the universal. The only saving grace is that she is brought low by her adherence to that prototype doctrine of the Romantic; her fascism ultimately leads to her dismissal.Grade: D"
4,The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,The story is of a spinsterish teacher at an all girls school in Scotland. The action takes place through a series of flashbacks before and after World War II.Miss Brodie takes six young girls under her wing and the girls spend their school years in a sort of cult with their teacher; a cult recognized and envied by both students and faculty. Miss Brodie's style of teaching is somewhat unorthodox and the girls learn about life in addition to their studies.Whether the girls were better off as the result of Miss Brodie's tutelage is up for debate. Miss Brodie is very frank about her sexual liasons and even tries to fullfill her own repressed sexuality by proxy throgh the girls. Additionally Miss Brodie's admiration of facism is passed on to her pupils.Miss Brodie is ultimately betrayed by the one girl who she felt had the most potential. Miss Brodie is ultimately dismissed and she spends her remaining years wondering who was her Judas.
2,The Prime of Ms. Narcissist,"Our Ms. Jean Brodie believes she has been betrayed but lacks even the tiniest bit of self-awareness needed to see that she was the betrayer.She has betrayed the trust her students have in her. She is cruel,manipulative,backstabbing and absolutely convinced of the rightness of her beliefs. This is a woman who manipulates a student into having sex with a married man. Are we supposed to think she is enlightened because she rebels at traditional education? Who,in 1938,is a Hitler sympathizer?From a literary standpoint,it seems as though it was written by an amateur-professional writer. I expected more.If it was not so short I would give it one star."
3,reading for highschool,"This book was assigned to me for reading in preperation for my freshman year of highschool. I found it hard to get into at first. What keep me going was how all the characters evolved.It was funny, but the relationships seemed strange to me. I could not help feeling that Miss Brodie was a tad on the crazy side. The writing was spectacular. The book is a real page-turner"
4,Good 'n' short...,"We are a class of seven girls, and we have a female English teacher who has aspirations to become the next Miss Jean Brodie... As we read the book, we began to notice similarities between our teacher, Miss Sinclair, and Miss Brodie herself. Now, we have the distinct feeling that we in effect ARE the Sinclair set, but we don't seem to get to play very much golf... We were divided about the book. Some of us, including myself, found it very good, whereas others found it a bit stupid and unbelievable. One of the books benefits was it's shortness, as it was just the right length to read over, say, a weekend. However, it is doubtful that a teacher would get away with such extreme actions for so long. We all felt that Miss Brodie was portrayed as a victim of her own strong will, and that some of her thinking and teaching was particularly ahead of her time."
4,An uterly amazing woman in her prime,This book is fabulous. Miss Jean Broadie is such a romantic woman and her set are all truely affected by her
2,Used book sellers be more descriptive about the condition of your book.,"small paperback, pretty yellowed out pages..the description in the website is too generic, hard to distinguish from many other great used books I have previously purchased. Either the book seller should sell it at a negative number and make up for its true value when adding the overpriced handling/shipping costs or drop the shipping/handling costs."
4,Slim Masterpiece,"I couldn't help by shake my head and marvel after finishing The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie. Not only are the characters superb, the story is great and the writing uniquely insightful. Also, the novel is so cleverly and masterfully written. From the first pages you are taken in by its fugue-like structure. I've never read a book like it, where past and present fuse into one, as if the narrator is dipping in and out of time to present a perfectly cogent story not hindered by the rules of causality. Future events are casually revealed, descriptions are repeated as if musical motifs, and yet the plot moves inexorably to its inevitable conclusion. In the end you are left enriched by the lives of Miss Jean Brodie and her set, by their idiosyncrasies, failures, highs and lows. And it's short enough to read in a sitting or two, to boot!"
5,Best Sketch Comedy,The State is by far the best sketch comedy ever written. The whitty and random skits devliver loads of laughs. I was ecstatic when I found the Season 1 episodes Video on Demand. Now please make available Seasons 2 & 3! I keep hoping The State delivers a box DVD collection. I need to introduce The State to my fellow Gen Xers who missed it in the 90's. PS keep the origional music intact because it rocks.
4,modern science fiction,"Absolute Magnitude is one of the best hard science fiction magazines out there. Here is an anthology of some of their best fiction since 1993 (when the magazine was called Harsh Mistress). These stories will probably appeal only to hard science fiction fans. Others may find some of them too weird. Also, you won't find any fantasy or horror in here - just modern science fiction at its purest form. The anthology includes many Hugo-award winners, such as Terry Bisson and Allan Steele, and noteworthy stories ""Sortie"" and ""The Prize"". Generally, if you're new to SF, I wouldn't recommend this book. Some of the stories here have a style that's an acquired taste. Still, this book is a good way to check out what hard science fiction is like today."
5,Very Under rated,"The first time I ever heard the voice of Lisa Page Brooks was when I listened to the ""Standard"" CD by her group ""Witness"" back in 1997 who I love still to this day. I listen to the Witness CD everyday and most definetly Lisa's CD. What's just so encouraging about her music is that the scriptures are used and you can listen to her music today, tomorrow, 10 years from now and the word of GOD never changes and this is why her music and even the group ""Witness"" is still under rated. I am currently going through something and the self entitled Lisa Page Brooks CD is what has kept me encourage. The song ""Waiting"" is what gave me a reason to come to work with a skip in my step in spite of all that I may be going through. Lisa.. If you ever get to see these written reviews, please keep up the great work. So many are blessed by the anoiting GOD has placed on your music ministry."
2,"Great product, misleading description.","I love these pens, but the description says there are 12/box. They don't actually send you a box of them. I ordered two, and got two pens."
5,Papermate Fan!,"I've been a Papermate user for over 10 years. The X-Tend is a great series and when they introduced the purple, a no-brainer for a college student like myself. Now that they've been discontinued, I'm VERY great for the Web and Amazon. I usually buy a few boxes a year and give a few away as presents to my friends. They love 'em and when I tell them they've been discontinued, they can't believe it. It is a fantastic pen!"
1,fails expectations,"This video was ultimately dissapointing. The name fat-blasting yoga had me under the impression that it would be some kind of power/vinyasa yoga. I worked as hard as I could, and I didn't even break a sweat. I admit that I am quite fit, being a dancer and regular exerciser anyway, but I often sweat with other yoga videos (like the Total Yoga Fire). The asanas aren't hard, and her instructions (or lack thereof) are not helpful. Apart from that, i found her voice to be so annoying that it distracted me from my form and breathing, which is something that's hard to make me do. She sounded like she was trying to be ""mystical"" with her tone. Overall, you'd be better off with the total yoga series or using Yoga Journals guidelines to make your own set for your yoga practice."
1,Crikey!,"I've never written a review before, but I feel very strongly about this workout video and think everyone should know about it. Why? 'Cause it sucks. I'm not joking. Denise Austin is like a mad woman in this video... she's all over the damned place and her voice is constantly grating. Yap-Yap-Yap... Yoga is supposed to be relaxing, but this woman is like a crazy dyslexic hurricane who's all over the place. I'll probably give it another shot... the workout itself looks cool, but it's just too damned fast."
3,Another Yoga disk,"I love Denise Austin. If you like her perky, get off the couch, enthusiastic style, then you might consider this disk. She is at once and the same time energetic, athletic, thoughtful, and deceptively sexy. Again, you have to like or love Denise Austin to consider this disk. If you are an adherent or aspirant to yoga in general, there are many yoga disks out there that are much better. In fact, Denise Austin has made better ones. This disk has some stretching and posing which is somewhat parallel to yoga but I would not pick this as my first choice to learn of or practice the fine art of yoga..."
2,Not Enough Direction,Denise Austin is a fantastic aerobic instructor but her yoga workouts are not something I recommend. This workout is a yogaerobics workout - that's fine if that's what you're looking for. I'm pretty advanced at yoga but her lack of guidance and jarring movements can cause serious injury to a non beginner. Her voice is distracting because of the constant upbeat chatter and the music is just as distracting. No focus on mindfulness - very important factor here! There is no real seamless movement into asanas as there should be. After her workout I was more annoyed than relaxed - as you should be after serious yoga practice. She doesn't explain what the poses are for beginners - she jumps right in as if you should know them already. Grant it - it will make you sweat and give you a good workout but you have to be careful because if you can't keep up - you run the risk of injury. She should stick to aerobic workouts.
1,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed by this DVD. It's definitely not for beginners--there is no instruction whatsoever. The chapter entitled ""Introduction to Yoga"" consists of Denise talking about yoga, but gives no demonstrations or intructions on technique. Also, the description of the DVD on the back of the case says that there are three different workouts: one 30-minute and two 15-minute. In actuality, you must choose from 10 chapters:1. Intro to Yoga2. Cardio Conditioning3. The Warrior Series4. Balancing Stick Series5. Tree Pose Series6. Strength Conditioning7. Twist and Stretch8. Core Conditioning9. Obliques10. Focus on AbdominalsAgain, this is NOT for beginners. When you choose a chapter, you are just thrown into a workout, without any instruction (i.e. ""Let's begin with a warrior pose""). Having never done yoga before, I have no idea what a warrior pose is. If you are a beginner, I recommend Yoga Journal's Yoga Step by Step."
4,good quick workout!,"I take traditional yoga classes once a week and don't have a lot of time to practice at home. But when I want to do something in between, I often use this video. It's much more active than traditional yoga, but very satisfying. If you are looking for a fast 30-45 minute workout, I would recommend this. It's also nice to do yoga along with a video to keep your pace consistant."
5,"Not traditional Yoga DVD, but Great Workout!","If you're looking for a traditional, mind-focused Yoga DVD, this is NOT the DVD that you want. However, if you're looking for a good Cardio workout without all of the jumping around and wonderful toning exercises (including a 15-minute bonus segment with a stability ball), then this IS the DVD for you!"
2,more like aerobic yoga,"i do yoga because i have bad knees; really bad knees; they make noise when i go up and down stairs. this dvd will aggravate, rather than help any joint problems you might have. rather than a flowing, yoga based sequence, denise leads you through quickly paced lunges, squats, and jumps with a few yoga poses thrown in between. it would make a good aerobic sequence, but it shouldn't masquerade as yoga. and i found her really annoying, but i was looking for a variation on rodney yee, not richard simmons."
4,good workout!,"I've been using this DVD off and on for a few weeks. The first segment is a combination of some basic yoga moves (tree, warrior, with tons of sun salutations thrown in) done in a really quick style for a cardio workout. At first it seems challenging (especially for people who aren't familiar with these poses) because she moves very quickly.I'm not too thrilled with the last 2 segments of the DVD, I really don't like the balance ball segment. Some of these moves are very tricky to figure out. I've had a better core workout from the Gaiam balance ball DVDs.Denise's voice is a bit annoying at times (she has an ex-smoker/phone sex operator throaty voice) but she's always perky and encouraging, which, even for a cynic, can be helpful when you feel like you can't keep up!Overall, it's a good workout!"
1,WARNING! This is not real yoga,"This was one of my least favorite workouts of all time. If you are expecting yoga you will not get it from this DVD. She turns the basic yoga workout into an aerobic sequence with little to no instruction, no relaxation, time to move into poses or instructions on breathing. I worked up a sweat, but I could have easily injured myself if I hadn't modified the poses on my own. Also, the final workout is not possible without a stability ball so if you want to work your abs and you don't own a ball than you will get no help from this DVD."
2,Not for the average woman,"I have a number of Denise's videos and while I find her voice and comments annoying ( I turn down the sound and put music on), I usually like her workouts. I have done yoga for 2 years and have run, biked and done strength-training all my life, so I'm in better shape than the average 40+ woman. I would NOT recommend these workouts for the average person. It moves too fast in places and too slow in others. If your balance isn't that of a gymnast, you will be falling over numerous times and struggling to figure out what the heck she's doing. I like to workout hard, but this is just not a well-designed workout. Crunch's Perfect Yoga Workout is much better, especially the Fat Burning Workout.Don't waste your money, if you can do this workout - you don't need it!!"
2,"Welcome to ""Yog-aerobics""","This is not ""yoga"" in the classical sense. First, this woman's voice gets annoying--""Oh, I love this stretch!"" (Say what?) Second, her balancing poses make my feet hurt. Third, if you are not in any kind of shape, it is HARD--too hard, and you can hurt yourself bad. If you must have it, WATCH this video while working with your Thighmaster set (or something) FIRST before actually working out with it. Keep the controller handy to back it up . .again, this is ""yog-aerobics."" If you are one of those with hypothyroidism and adrenal exhaustion (as described in The Schwarzbein Principle II) this is NOT what you are looking for. Proceed with caution, people."
1,"Not Yoga, and She's Irritating!","This is not yoga. This is an aerobics routine with some yoga poses thrown in. There is zero attention paid to the importance of the breath, to getting in tune with your body, to the calming and focusing effects of yoga-- and thus, to everything that yoga is actually about. Instead, Ms. Austin has tailored some of her cardio routines so that she could slip in some yoga poses and market it as a yoga DVD. Worse yet, she provides no instruction on the poses and there is thus a high risk of injury. And, on top of the ridiculously un-yogic practice itself, the tape is backed with high-energy music and her constant, mindless yammering. There's not a moment of silence in this entire routine. The woman obviously has no idea of what yoga is about in the least, immediately evidenced by the cover which, appropriately, shows her in a yoga-like pose, not an actual one. Try Shiva Rea or Rodney Yee if you'd like to try a genuine yoga teacher."
2,Not really yoga in the traditional definition,"Yoga ... quiet, relaxed, union of the mind and body - right?? Well, not this program. This is yoga on speed. Yes, the postures resemble yoga, but the pace and repetitions are enough to qualify as a hard aerobic workout. Maybe I should have tuned into the word ""blasting"" because blasted is what my body felt like after a couple of minutes trying to keep up with Ms Austin. If you are looking for a traditional yoga class, pass on this one. You'll find little peace in this workout."
4,I use this almost daily,"True, it is not yoga in it's pure form, however, it certainly incorporates yoga in the workout. I would call it an aerobic yoga workout. Denise is annoying as hell, but it gives me someone to cuss at while I'm ""feeling the burn."" She does this thing with her eyes that I can laugh about and still appreciate that I am getting a good workout.I definitely like the workout, and my body actually feels good when I am done. The only reason it didn't get a five is because I feel the name of the DVD isn't exactly accurate to what you get."
2,Way to fast for yaoga,"I am NOT impressed with this workout at all! I have taken yoga classes before and I have a basic idea of what I am doing.. but this tape moves way to fast. I couldn't keep up. She jumps from one pose to the next so quickly. It doesn't give you anytime to make sure your body is postioned properly, So you can avoid injury.I give this DVD 2 thumbs down"
5,Love it. Would recommend to friends.,"As a Denise Austin fan for about ten years, I love this DVD. I like her motivating words and reminders to ""smile you're burning butter!"" Her focus is on quality versus quantity. I'm currently about four months pregnant and up until recently this workout served as a good light impact exercise to help me stay fit. I can see myself still using this DVD after the baby to get back in shape."
2,Just Plain Awful!,I was thinking about buying this and borrowed it from NETFLIX first. It is just awful! I own Denise's Yoga Body Burn and I like it alot. This is not really yoga at all!
5,Yoga with a twist!,"If you love yoga and you need a challenge, this one is for you! It is definitely not for beginners, though. If you're new to yoga, you may want to try a beginners yoga video and get used to the poses as well as learn the poses by name because Denise really moves through them in this video! It is great workout and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves yoga and wants to break a sweat. You definitely feel results after your first work out. It's also great how the video is split into 3 parts for the days you are running low on time. One little note, the 3rd part requires a stability ball for best results. Happy exercising!! :)"
4,Good Buy,"Got this for my mother, she said the DVD was in great condition for it being preowned, not a scratch on it! It was a good buy."
4,GREAT workout for Intermediates!!,"This is a high energy workout for someone who likes to do yoga but has a hard time getting the motivation for cardio. It is fast paced and fun, and if you are familiar with basic yoga poses is a great addition to your yoga practice!!"
1,NOT YOGA! If there were 0 stars I would have selected that,"I suppose Denise Austin is tying to exploit the popularity of yoga. But, even the picture on the box is not a yoga pose (but it looks simmilar to one and maybe the uninitiated might not know the difference). If you are just starting out there are lots of good beginner level tapes out there (but this is not one of them). Check out the tapes from Living Arts ...or better yet, if possible, take the money you would have spent on this and get yourself to a live class, where a real teacher can provide insights, feedback and corrections!"
3,not always consistent,"Doing this video actually frustrates me. Some exercises are done 2 on one leg, yet four on the other. There are times she says one more, when it is quite a few more. For those of us that are not coordinated, it makes it hard to follow, at least until you've memorized the video. I am not sure I will do this one enough times for that though. Rodney Yee's Power Yoga - Stamina is much better..."
2,good workout if you can take Denise (I can't),"I had misgivings about buying a yoga DVD lead by an aerobic queen, and I wish I'd listened to them.This would be a good workout if it were led by someone else and if there were modifications given.As it is, Denise drones on incessantly -- but not explaining how to do the moves (there are virtually no instructions). Instead she keeps telling you ""You can do it, you can get fit through yoga."" And, ""I'm so proud of you, you're getting fit through yoga."" And if that's not enough, she keeps flaring her eyes at the camera. Ugh.If you can put up with this though, I'm sure the ""fat blasting"" part will pay off."
2,No. Wrong. Just wrong.,"This is not yoga. This is what happens when you take a spastic high-energy aerobics instructor and have her try to settle down and do yoga. I don't think Denise Austin even understands what the concept of yoga is all about. This video is awful. If you are beginning learning yoga, stay far far away. I don't even know what you call this, but it should be banned from using the word yoga.I am giving it 2 stars b/c maybe you could burn some fat if you could stand getting though it which I could not. I'm not saying it's not fat blasting, I'm just saying it's not yoga."
3,Not Yoga,"Not a bad workout BUT not YOGA. Denise adds her ""fat-burning"" moves onto traditional Hatha Yoga moves. If you have never taken yoga courses under the supervision of a trainer, I don't recommend this DVD. She moves too quickly through poses that need to be taken slowly to ensure you are doing each properly. Breathing is imp., as she addressed in the beginning of the tape, but it is not stressed throughout the routine. Not my favorite Denise workout- I like her Hit the Spot Pilates much better. I recommend the Richard Freeman's DVD for Yoga Practice- but I think all new yogies should attend classes prior to doing it by themselves. I have learned this from my past experiences; my instructors have often corrected my form and poses even when I thought I was doing it right. Have fun, but practice safely!"
5,Great workout that's easy to stick with!,"I used to do this DVD with my friends all the time. When I started, I never did any sort of exercise beyond walking to class. Just wasn't my thing. Once I began this workout, I had fun doing it with my friends and was able to stick with it until my friend who owned the DVD moved away. Denise Austin doesn't use true yoga here, but I don't mind since I'd rather feel like I'm accomplishing something. It's somewhat exhausting in the moment, but still totally do-able for a 20-something beginner like me. You'll probably be tired and sore the next day, but in a good way! I could tell my muscle tone was improving and my flexibility went through the roof! I went from not being able to touch my ankles to being able to put my palms completely on the floor. I also like that it is low-impact, since other cardio activites like running or traditional aerobics usually cause me pain because of my high arches. I can't wait to be able to do this workout regularly again!"
4,"A rushed workout, but good nonetheless","Unlike some of Denise Austin's other yoga dvds, this one moves rather quickly. At some points it feels more like rushing that working out, but it still gets your heart moving. If you're looking for a calming yoga workout this is not the dvd for you. This is a good mix of cardio and stretching, however."
4,Worth a second try,"I didn't like the DVD the first time that I tried it, plus I was a Yoga beginner and got a little lost. However, I gave it a 2nd chance and now do it more than any of my other workout DVD's. I've been doing it for about 2 weeks, and feel results in my arms, back, and legs. Some of the poses are too advanced for me, but at least it's something for me to work up to."
2,I wish I read the reviews here prior to buying!,"I am a dance teacher and have been dancing many years. I can follow routines easily, but similar to Denise's Pilates, it really doesn't give much instruction. You're forced to ""follow the leader"" and hopefully you know enough about body alignment not to hurt yourself.The routine in the first segment, while fun, moved too quickly to really ascertain where you are with placement, and very little instruction is given concerning placement, which is sad. You don't know if you're really doing these poses correctly or not, and with Pilates and Yoga, there is reason for good alignment, placement, so on. Otherwise you're not able to maximize what's really there.Denise should consider a preview/reference segment where things are better explained and positions could be practised prior to engaging in the full workout."
1,Aerobics disguised as yoga,"I love Denise Austin. Before I discovered yoga, I used to work out with her morning show every day and did so for years. She was very encouraging and optimistic, and she's a good *aerobics* instructor. However...this DVD is basically Denise's attempt to fight the fact that she (professionally speaking) is becoming obsolete. The last worthwhile video she came out with was ""Blast Away 10 Lbs"". She needs to stick with stuff like that, because she's great at it, and leave the yoga videos to someone else.The warm-up was completely insufficient, the poses and their proper form is not explained, and I'm sorry, but when it comes to yoga there is no such thing as ""4 more counts then repeat on other side"" or ""up, down, up, down, keep moving"". The poses are moved through at too quick of a pace to feel their benefits. I just don't like this DVD...if I want to do aerobics, I'll do aerobics, but the next time I do yoga, it won't be with this."
5,Wonderful protector!,"This bag is padded well to protect these delicate chimes. The strap holds the instrument in place so that it won't be tangling the chimes as they are being stored and/or carried. Even though I have only one set, the section AVAILABLE for a second set of chime holds my stand attachment well and allows everything I need to be easily at hand. I don't have to look around for where I put the connector after using the chimes the last time. You might also wish to tuck a small hand towel into this bag to use as a quick mute for your chimes, too!! Great bag! Keeps everything handy!"
2,Pages missing,There were pages missing. Example: on the back of page 81 was page 84. 82 & 83 missing. This happened at least 4 times that I have discovered.
4,Handel's Messiah - choral score,"Copy was in lightish print , though clear and clean. back cover somewhat soiled with print ""smudge"" but generally a good softcover copy of the score. Excellent value."
1,never arrived,I have ordered twomdifferent books of the Messiah ND HAVE NOT RECEIVED EITHER OF THEM. iN THIS SMALL COMMUNITY IT IS BEST TO USE THE US MAIL AS VERY FEW HOUSES HAVE OUTSIDE ADDRESSES SHOWING AND THE SNOW IS VERY DEEP FOR SOME FRONT DOORS THAT A DELIVERY MAN MAY BE LOOKING FOR.
4,"Inexpensive, includes measure numbers","It doesn't cost much, and it includes measure numbers. I don't think the Schirmer edition does."
3,"A ""tough read""","Category Theory shouldn't be this tough.I was trained as an electrical engineer, so, my math is reasonably good.However, I can't get through this book.It is geared more to a mathematician rather than someone like me, who is a software consultant, and is trying to learn Category Theory in order to gain a deeper understanding of the programming language Haskell."
3,You may not need this unless you major in category theory.,"I entirely agree with the reviewer Lucas Wilman.As a book by the creator of category theory, it has extensively incorpoated relevant items.However I don't think this is a *must read"" unless you major in the subject: you will seldom need more than what is covered in a typical homological algebra course.My inmpression is this book should be entitled ""Categories for the starting/working category theorists""."
2,Poorly written standard text.,"This book has everything you need, but it is written in an abstruse style in my opinion."
1,Bad investment,I am not very good on the computer but after I downloaded this Panda Antivirus I can't tell you how many items I lost on my computer. I thought it was better then Norton but I was so wrong. I now have to pay to have my computer fixed. Save your money. This item should not even be sold on Amazon it is so bad.
2,probably good for a cat or chihuahua,"Product appeared to be of good quality, but was much too small for my 12 pound Jack Russell. Merchant cooperated and accepted return, though I wound up paying shipping both ways."
5,better than tanked,killer blanks is their best album out.this album is full of songs you can sing along to while you pogo the night away.pogo punk at it's finest.
1,Edited,"The Digiview Version of this title, all be it inexpensive, is an edited version. This decent ""B"" Title has been chopped to remove the nudity for this cheap DVD release. I don't know if Digiview did it or it is just the copy they got, but the R rating doesn't really apply to this version."
1,Edited version,"This edited DVD version eliminated much of the mature content out of the video. For purists who like to see what the director intended, beware of altered versions like this DVD presentation of Amnesia."
2,Not Bad,"This movie is a little campy. There's a great little scene where the luckless, fatherless stepson of the bad preacher is playing with a paddleball and he just can't hit that ball for nothin'. That's kind of his lot in life. His stepfather's too busy sleeping with the women in his congregation to take notice of him. The mom (Ally Sheedy) is lost in her own little world of inhibition and resentment. About two-thirds of the way through it began to really seem like the actors were adlibbing the dialogue as they went. The storyline starts looking like a copy of Misery toward the end. But there's some good acting (especially Sally Kellerman) and a great soundtrack. The movie's entertaining, not extraordinarily so, but a pleasant way to spend two hours."
1,Avoid like the plague,Absolute Crap! Avoid! Doesn't even deserve one star. Save your money [...] if you really need to get it. The George edition isn't any better!
4,"A charming, nostalgic and unusually entertaining CD.","I adore Peter Mintun and his choice of material; it's witty and entertaining. The addition of his friend's impressive music adds to the experience. I loved hearing the theme song from ""Auntie Mame"" and the march from ""King Kong"", in addition to the lovely Gershwin medley. Great fun."
2,LG what does that mean? Lasting garbage?,"I only rip from this drive. I don't think it can handle all of the formats it professes to. I burn from the model lower.I wasn't impressed with the lightscribe images, even after, upgrading the software to better than best. This is for cds, not the softer contrast dvds.My friend has an actual HP burner, which blows passed this one for images.I wouldn't buy it again for:1) It's tempermental about the discs it wants (vs it's brother).2) Doesn't burn a clean image in light scribe3) Rarely closes on exit/re-boot.RAM isn't too bad though. Using Verbatim discs.For light-scribe, I'd find someone else. For everything up to it, I'd buy another one of these."
3,Deceiving Descriptions by Amazon!,"I bought this CD thinking it was a lost album by the lovely voiced Rena Scott. Nowhere in the item description did it tell me that it was a CD single. Dual Disc was mentioned,2 CDs were mentioned, but not the fact it was only one track. (There was also only one disc thanks Amazon). That said it's a lovely track and Rena is in great voice. Theaccompanying video clip is a tad lame though and has mini budget written all over it. Please reword your item description so nobody else makes this mistake."
5,bug deflector,This is very nice looking on the truck. It has the AVS emblem on it witch makes it look even better. Very easy to put on. Holes line up with the ones already underneath on the truck hood. My truck is torch red and the black deflector and vent visors make it look really sharp.
2,Bug deflector?,"Mounting screws were missing but called manufacture and replacements were sent. Istallation was inder 10 minutes and it looks good but it is too low of profile to deflect bugs. Live in rural area and driving at night, bug splatter windshield. Would not recommend"
1,not water assistance,"in frist time when I washed my hand the water entered the glass . then I contacted the amazon customer service . I returned and they sent me another watch , but same problem . the water became inside the watch , and now it doesn't work at all .I will not returned and I will not buy it any more ."
4,Whitesnake (Great White Music Poster Print),"We have received payment and it has cleared. Your poster is now on the way.See Note form supplier - 12th Feb 2007 Still waiting for delivery!Please be extra patient as the mail has been VERY slow lately. Overseas shipping can sometimes take a VERY long time. If for any reason it does not arrive we will make sure this matter is handled. Although it is rare, we do recommend you allow between 6-7 weeks for it to arrive before requesting a refund.Thank you for being understanding!Best RegardsGCD"
2,Has a Defective Microphone,"I got this model and really liked the Feature, But came to know that it had Defective microphone, So got it replaced with same model and found that too had defective microphone."
2,"not nearly as good as the Empire ""Art of""","In brief, this is NOT an ""Art of"" book. It's a script with a lot of pretty pictures. I can buy the script in several other different formats, but this is the only chance for me to find anything out about the artwork, and this book simply does not do it. Lucasfilm seems to alternate between so-called ""Art of"" books with the script shoved in (New Hope, Jedi), and actual, quality ART books (Phantom Menace, Empire) that recognize that the script can be found elsewhere. Hopefully the remaining books in the series will leave the script OUT."
4,Looked through it and had to have it,"I should preface this with the following caveat: never buy a book of illustrations without having looked though it first. That said, these are exactly the kinds of drawings I like to use as background textures and they are lend themselves easily to incorporation into other projects. The images are in public domain, so there is no worry of copyright infringement. Because of the variety of images, I have been able to get a lot of use out of it. The CDs also give you high and low res versions of each image."
1,Big disappointment.,"If you arent looking for vintage (1800 - 1940) drawings, this collection is a waste of money.First of all, the most recent object in this collection is from the 1940's. Even the newest train drawing in this book is from the 1800's.No contemorary drawings as well. All old style ink work.No index, no vector based files.I would definately not bought it if i had a chance to look inside."
3,Adolescent Historical Fiction,"""Where Duty Calls: The Story of Sarah Emma Edmonds"" is a recently published, fictionalized account of the life of Union spy Sarah Edmonds. The plot of the story itself is quite interesting, chronicling the adventures of a female who poses as a male spy during the Civil War. The book, although not noted as relevant to a certain age category, is more suitable for younger children. Although it includes excerpts from Edmond's autobiography, and does well in sticking to the facts, it reads like a young adventure novel. It is definitely a more fictionalized account of Edmonds life, and doesn't go into the more intellectual and historical issues of gender roles and Union spies. If you would like a well-written, simplistic overview of Edmonds' life; or if you know a young child who likes to read about real life spies, then ""Where Duty Calls"" is the book for you."
4,How Can This Be in Wide Screen,"How can this be in Wide Screen, it was never done in wide screen it was done in Full Screen only. I am going to wait for the full screen version, before I buy the new series."
1,*Pale* imitation,"Johnny Depp isn't Barnabas & Ben Cross isn't Barnabas. Many fans of this will argue it had been short-lived due to coverage of the gulf war. That simply isn't true. The revival series was obviously cancelled because the essence of Dark Shadows (the original) couldn't be recaptured & as such, drew low ratings. There were 12 episodes. 12 episodes too long. You don't monkey around with success. What was Dan Curtis thinking? I strongly recommend the original."
1,Half House of Dark Shadows Remake-Half Series Rehash,"I couldnt believe that Dan Curtis raped his own HODS movie to fill the first four episodes of this revival series. Even down to the first victim running for their car and and getting in too late, and even Barnabas first person view knock on the door and entry into the foyer as he is announced. Davids Handball Rhymes, Carolyn/Daphnes staking, Elliot Stokes/Professor Michael getting turned. What a scam and nothing I expected from a Producer of Dan Curtis's stature. The rest of the series, the time travel of Vicky Winters is of course predictable if you have seen the original series and adds nothing of value to raise it above anything but a copycat of the original."
1,widescreen?,"I am sick and tired of the industry shoving wide screen down my throat. I did not pay over a thousand dollars for a tv to only see one-third of the picture through the middle. This program was aired in full screen and though I have watched the tapes that I borrowed from a friend and would really like to own this set, as I have all of the original Dark Shadows episodes except for the last one, collection 25, on DVD, I refuse to buy this as long as it is offered only in widescreen. There are so many good movies that I would like to have that I refuse to buy because of being offered only in wide screen. In the stores I have seen wide screen recently released movies in the sale bins. Rarely do I see full screen of recent movies in the sale bins. Will they get the hint? I doubt it, but in the mean time they are making a lot less money. Thanks for reading."
3,D. Caruso,"I think people are writting, to show their interent/enthusiam that a certain show is coming out.Or at least that's what I do.--------Moving on.I couldnt be happier to be hearing about this release. For the last couple of weeks I have been waiting impatiently to have a little dark shadows marathon. I remember at 7, sitting in a tent my father constructed in the living room just spellbound as the stories of 1790 arc spilled out. It had been my first viewing of the Dark Shadows (compressed but entertaining) saga. Only years later did I see the orignal. While the original has it's own cheesiness, I still prefer this version.I'm already ready to preorder this. And when it comes there will be a review."
1,DISAPPOINTMENT OF A LIFE-TIME...............,"and i guess along, i knew it would be!!! dark shadows 1966-71 is the only dark shadows. period.!!! THERE IS NO.. nor...EVER CAN BE a ""revival"" of the original...sorry! ""revival"" was a VERY forgettable attempt by dan curtis (genius) to desparately cling on to an old idea...and i don't blame him, cause it' is my favorite show of all time, but by the 90's, the people and the mood was altogether different fom the 60's...cast and acting not of 66-71 caliber, destined to fail because of that alone...was time to seal the old coffin up 1n 1971...and not be disturbed in '90 or '91 or whenever the heck it was."
3,Which series is this?,"I'm confused. The name of this DVD is Dark Shadows: The Revival Series, but the date is 1966 and the credits list Joan Bennett as the star. Is this the original Jonathan Frid version or the Ben Cross remake version?"
1,"i paid for dark shadows, they sent me nothing","i ordered this on june5,today is july7 and i still have not received my order, i have also sent 2 e-mails to them and i have gotten no respose as of this time..so i will have to rate them as theives and they get no stars from me...ps.in order to let you know what theives these people are i had to give them one star so i could post this comment.BUT THEY GET NO STARS FROM ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Dark Shadows Primetime Revival,"I'm a third of the way through this set and I'm amazed I don't remember more of it, although I watched the entire series when it was originally broadcast. I would have preferred a full screen format, even though I have no issues with the clarity and definition. The packaging is somewhat cheap; the cover photo is already starting to peel off, revealing a different cover underneath. A printed synopsis of episodes would have been nice. People who only know Dark Shadows from the recent movie will probably find this confusing at first. Despite these qualms, I'm pleased with the set and can't wait to see Lysette Anthony as Angelique torment Barnabas."
1,*Pale* imitation,"Johnny Depp isn't Barnabas & Ben Cross isn't Barnabas. Many fans of this will argue it had been short-lived due to coverage of the gulf war or something. But no, it was obviously cancelled because the essence of Dark Shadows (the original) couldn't be recaptured. This was 12 episodes & 12 episodes too long. You don't monkey around with success. What was Dan Curtis thinking? I strongly recommend the original."
3,Ok revival but don't waste your money.,"I found this whole series for $9.99 at Walmart the other day. Don't pay the thirty-something bucks for it here. It isn't worth it. The only good thing about this revival was that when I watched it in the early '90's it got me into the original daytime-soap series which I now own on DVD. Ben Cross is NOT on par with Johnathan Frid as Barnabas Collins. The revival series also ended in a very poor spot whereas the original soap kinda wrapped everything up in the end. Although this revival might be worth watching to kill some time, that's about it. Stick with the original series! It's sooo much better!"
2,Disappointing,"There was very little that I liked about the revival of Dark Shadows. Jean Simmons was really good as Elizabeth Collins Stoddard and I liked Joanna Going as Victoria Winters. Jim Fyfe's portrayal of Willie Loomis was different but amusing. These were the good points.I hated Ben Cross as Barnabas Collins! I realize that anyone would have a difficult time filling Jonathan Frid's shoes but when I watched this revival I found myself praying that he'd get staked! As for Barbara Steele, she's a good actress in her own right but her portrayal of Julia Hoffman didn't impress me. And I much prefer Lara Parker's Angelique to Lysette Anthony's. The ""new"" Angelique was little more than a sleaze.There is only one Dark Shadows and that is the original! Long live Jonathan Frid and company!"
1,Great series . . . but do not waste your money on these DVDs!,"First off, as others have mentioned, the images have been cropped to create a ""fake widescreen"" effect. And the night time scenes appear as day time scenes because they didn't bother to fix the levels on the transfer. There are really no bonus features to speak of. No 5.1 mix. It doesn't get much worse than this. Save your money hope that they get this right some day."
3,Why did they hack the screen up ?,"It sure would have been nice to see the version as it was origanally shown. Dan Curtis always shot his movies on 16mm film,not widescreen, so it doesn't make any sense to crop the picture. For nearly 30 bucks we should at least have a choice to view in widescreen or standard. Other than that it was a great series and worth seeing, I'll be selling mine cheap on Amazon marketplace after I finish watching it."
2,"Loved the show, but not this DVD set...","I was delighted to hear that this ""remake"" of Dark shadows was coming to DVD, though irritated to discover that it is a ""cropped"" version for 16:9 widescreen TVs. Indeed, I have a 16:9 TV, but I would have much preferred the original aspect ratio of 4:3.With apparently no extras, as well as missing footage, MGM has likely disenfranchised the very audience that it should be targeting with this release."
5,One Of The Best Vampire Series Ever,"I just recently brought 'Dark Shadows The Revival The Complete Series' and I'm here to say that there's is no missing Episodes. I did notice when I put the DVD in, and press 'play all episodes' it didn't play them all so what I did was go to play each episode one by one. I'm here to say that there is no missing footage and I'm very happy with this DVD series. I recorded all the episodes on VHS tapes years ago when it first air and compare them to the DVD,all the footage was there. If you are a dark shadows fan, this is the perfect set for you...I swear watching this dvd brought back so many great memories...Thanks Much"
5,I loved the show & the DVD was simple but good,"You can see the tie between ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" and Dark Shadows. It is a romantic and saucey tale of vampires and forbidden love. A little hokey for the 80's but it hits the spot."
5,Dark Shadows the revival,"This was an excellent DVD thank you so much, I remember watching this many years ago when it was a serial so thank you for bringing back so many memories. Great DVD."
3,Clarification,"There seems to be some difference of opinion as to whether or not this series is complete. It depends on what you consider complete. If you consider the aired version to be definative, then it's complete. As far as I can tell, every second of what is on the disks aired on NBC. MPI put out a VHS set that had an expanded version of the pilot and the last episode. I'm not sure if they included anything else in other episodes. If, like me, you consider that to be the definative version, then it's missing some material."
4,It's back for another go-round,"I absolutely loved Dark Shadows, Resurrected!!!!But was disappointed when it was left just kind of hanging. But.....NOW....THIS YEAR...in May.....there is going to be another DS!!!!I am thrilled. I hope it is as good as the90's series. If it is, then we are in fora treat."
3,Doesn't Hold a Candle to the Original,"Trying to cram over a year of the story, which was on five days a week into a season or so doesn't work. Many details and nuances have been left out. In addition, the performances pale in relation to the original. Despite the benefit of better production technology the show lacks the suspense and imagination of the original.M.D.E"
4,Dark Shadows with Palm Trees?,"The series is as uneven as the original. The acting goes from superb to super bad. Joana Going is much too carnal as Victoria Winters. I prefered the innocence and class of Alexandra Moltke. Jonathan Frid and Ben Cross are both excellent as Barnabas. The new Carolyn is dreadful. I didn't notice all the technical problems that other reviewers have written about with the exception of the constant sunshine in every scene. That is wrong wrong wrong for Dark Shadows. But the biggest visual flaw is the palm trees that one ocassionally glimpses. I mean, come on, this is supposed to be Maine? But I give it 4 stars because, hey people, it is Dark Shadows after all, and part of the DS charm has always been the shaky scenery, the daily bloopers and the over the top acting of the ensemble.If the opening strains of the Theramin Dark Shadows theme gives you goosebumps of delicious anticipation then this show is for you."
2,Faulty disc,"Great show, unfortunately in my copy of the revial series, disc one does NOT contain the episodes of Daphne dying, Julia discovering Barnabas and begining experiments. To me the best part of the story was left on some cutting floor. Shame on editors."
1,"Another ""Fake Widescreen"" cut dvd.","Another 1.33:1 tv show with the top and bottom ""CUT OFF"". When I was researching a widescreen tv to purchase, I went though what I believe to be every brand of tv. They all have to ability to zoom a 4x3 picture to full wide screen. essentialy cutting off the top and bottom ""IF"" the user so ""chooses"" to watch it that way. So why did mgm cut the top and bottom off? Also, the video is grainy with visual film artifacts. Rent it at the library. Don't buy it or pay any money for this horribly butchered tv show."
4,Ending dissapointing,"Loved the series, and it was a great story . But the ending was a great let down when considering the lead up to the end.It left you in the air ( so to speak) Apart from the that an enjoyable show."
5,Dark shadows;The revival the complete series,It started as I remenbered when it first appeared on tv the young girl riding on A train go to A place collingsport maine unaware of the evil that awaits her.
2,a dvd release that forgets the day-for-night transfer in a vampire series???,"the picture and sound are fine, and you don't mind the letterbox format if you've got a wide-screen television, but the fact that half this release's night scenes now have sunny, blue skies is in-excusable, and shame on mgm/sony pictures for such a hasty, un-supervised release. this seems like basic common sense. this oversight would be akin to the star wars films being released without the special effects being finished; with blue screens in half the shots where completed backgrounds are supposed to be. even the video-cassette release of this dark shadows revival series did it right.oh, well, at least the crickets still cricket."
1,Not again......,"I was of one the victims of the premature cancellation of the New Dark Shadows in 1991. I was devastated at that time and still am 20 years later. I consider that cancellation to be one of the most violent actions against consumers in the USA TV market. Unfortunately, nobody in the country did anything to reverse it.For this reason I was pretty happy when I learnt about the release of the DVD Dark Shadows - The Revival, and rushed to purchase it from Amazon. However I soon found out to my despair that the 3 DVD set does not contain the full story. The story in this new release has no end. Therefore it is not complete.I feel like I was victimized again and this is not fair."
5,The best of Horror!,This is one of the best renditions of Dark Shadows! Ben Cross is elegant as Barnabas and the other characters are larger than life. I would like to see the end however it sort of leaves you longing for more!
3,It could have been done better....,"Well, I got my pre-order from Amazon the day it came out. I have to admit I'm a little disapointed in the presentation, the episodes themselves are in fake wide-screen, EXCEPT the opening and closing credits, which have a black box all the way around them???? Explain that one to me.The twelve episodes are on three disks. Contrary to early reports, I don't see where any ""footage is missing"" as some people are harping about. For me it was great to finally get to see the footage previously unseen because of the Gulf War interruptions...Also, it looks like no effort was made to clean them up-specks and scratches abound, but not too bad. The picture is still MUCH MUCH sharper and colorful than my 2nd generation video tapes of the episodes.It was worth $28 dollars, but not much more.I'm glad to have them, tho."
5,Just as great as I remembered,"I loved this as a kid and I remember being very upset when it was cancelled. Watching it as an adult did put it in cheesy light, but I was still addicted after one episode! All I need to do now is buy and collect all the original episodes!"
3,Not as good as original,"I was a kid when the original Dark Shadows was made. It was better than this one, although the quality of the film was much better on this remake."
1,One of the Worst Movies...The Letter! :o(,"This movie was sooo bad, it doesn't even rate a 1 star but the system wouldn't let me give it less than 1. I usually enjoy Winona Ryder's & James Franco's movies but this was so slow and didn't make any kind of sense. Really surprised that these two big actors would even do this film. What a disgrace to their profession! Don't waste your time or money! :o(("
2,EH,I didnt dislike this movie but i didnt love it. i'd say i'd watch it again to get a better understanding but i dont want to....ever.
1,A Pathetic Hollywood Rip-off,"This movie is nothing more than a pathetic attempt to con money out of fans. And it worked! I paid $1.20 to rent this piece of crap from Redbox. The strategy was simple. Spend zero dollars on production, don't have a script, put Winona Ryder's face on the cover, and then suckers like me pay money for the damn thing. Apparently this is what actors do to make a buck when they can't get any legitimate work. A total rip-off! Do not buy this movie, do not rent this movie, do not watch this movie."
2,Disappointing,"This film seemed as though favours were being called in. I read that the director was one of James Franco's teachers and I can think of no other reason why this mess was made. The acting was fine but...............words fail me about the rest, and I cannot imagine who the target audience is, apart from hard-core fans of the principals."
2,Not sure what to think.....,"This is one of those films that tries to be artsy and clever with the photography but ends up being tiresome and a bit slow for no good reason. I did like Winona Ryder very much as the main character, a play director who is losing her sanity slowly as the rehearsals crumble and her relationships are strained."
4,Loved it!,If you are a James Franco or Winona Ryder fan this movie will not dissapoint. The close ups are poetic and the storyline is intriguing! My only wish is that it were longer. The Letter is suspenseful and I understood it completely. Whatever dialogue is lacking is made up by the chemistry between the actors. Loved it and will watch it again!
1,What the?????,"""The Letter"" is the most boring movie I have ever had the misfortune to watch. It makes the hour and a half run time seem like a month. I was actually worried that the machine I rented it from would not take it back. Narrated in a droning monotone voice by a playwrite/director the movie is about her attempts to direct and also re-write a boring and amateurish play which is in rehearsals. The dialogue between the actors is slow and seemingly meaningless in this clunker and I wonder why as fine an actor as James Russo would take a role in it. I read that ""The Letter"" cost ten million to make and if so it makes the Obama bailout of Solyndra seem like the deal of the decade! Do yourself a favor and skip this snooze-job unless you are experiencing sleeping problems in the first place."
3,Incomplete,"The book was new as stated, but there was no product key card in the book which allows the reader to access the companion website ""mycommunicationslab."" Without the key, the site is asking for $63+ to purchase one, when it should have accompanied the book. Better off purchasing from the college book store."
3,Communication,"I can't give a complete review because I still haven't finished the book, I am using it as part of my studies. But I can give you a review on Amazon. The service was great, especially shipping it over here to Australia. I would recommend Amazon to anyone who wanted to buy second hand books in good condition"
4,"Great book, especially for Communication majors!","The book was in the condition as promised! Great and informative book, especially for communications majors. This book even discusses signs of break ups or divorce and ways to avoid this. It also gives great details on how to avoid and handle conflict. Interesting self assessment test all throughout."
1,"Sales, sales, sales","I am giving this a ""1"" rating because I teach an Interpersonal Communications course and this is his FOURTH edition of the same materials in 4 years. This means not only do students have less used books to choose from, I have to reconfigure my teaching. Very frustrating."
2,disappointed in product,"This product is actually quite small. Even though is says mini, I still expected it to be a little bit bigger. Also, it will not stand up with a drink bottle in it. The seams on the bottom make it too unstable to stand alone."
1,A Better Move For Shogi,"The production is very poor, the music (in the first section) too loud. The second section is a repeat of the first. It also contains a break where Sam's young daughter takes over the narrative, babbling in her two-year way. Sam has abandoned the camera, which is allowed to run unattended, to answer someone's off-screen questions. If you wish to learn Shogi, seek out Hidetchi's videos on YouTube---they are wonderfully instructive."
5,Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant,"An invaluable tool for leaders implementing change/changes in their organizations. Harvey is brilliant as is his book, Checklist for Change.He provides pithy, to the point, step by step guides for the busy or reading challenged. Buy two because you will loan one copy out and never get it back.Thanks Dr. Harvey!"
4,A great place to start your Sun Ra collection!,This release covers various sessions from the late 50's and 1960 and shows the Arkestra in transition from their strange version of swing to the even stranger sound explorations of mid to late sixties sessions.
4,classic RA RA RA!,"This is one of my favorite Sun Ra releases. It covers so much ground, from swingin' big band nuggets to stretched-out, esoteric sketches, with all sorts of mummy-walking delights in between. Very recommended, even as a starting point for those curious about this Saturnian genius/trickster..."
5,"An ideal gift book for a friend, family member, or oneself","Melissa Placzek's Chin Deep In Bubbles: Little Luxuries For Every Day is a delightful compendium of useful health tips, fun ideas, and simple pleasures that will enhance our ordinary lives. Her recommended self-pamperings range from wonderful bath ideas, facial, and hair treatments, to aromatherapy, spa cuisine, and that special cup of coffee. Chin Deep In Bubbles is a wonderful collection of recipes for activities and treats all of which are splendidly illustrated with artwork. The result is a book to treasure and which will be referred to again and again and again. Chin Deep In Bubbles is an ideal gift book for a friend, family member, or oneself!"
4,Saw This On PBS The Other Night & Enjoyed It Very Much!!,"I DVR'd this documentary the other night while I was doing my pre-thanksgiving cooking.On thanksgiving day, after all the cooking was done and the family was engorged with food,I stole away upstairs to watch this from my recliner and though it didn't really hit on manythings that I didn't already know about Lennon during this period, the final decade of his life,I did think it was done well and yes, I would and will buy it for my collection.I just liked John Lennon's whole vibe and what he stood for in his life.The other reviewers have already articulated alot of the particulars, so I kept minestraight to the point! (-:"
4,Some new material here.,"Really enjoyed this memorable dvd. If you're a lover of the Beatles and especially John, you'll be very happy with this product."
5,john lennon bluray is a winner,this is a great movie to own if you are a john lennon or beatles fan .even on bluray the movie comes alive . upgrade to the bluray one ive seen many ones about john and the early days this one is a keeper .i only wish they included more songs
5,C'est Magnifique!,"My French isn't very good, so I don't really understand much of what she's saying. But if you found her through ""La Rage"" as I did, you probably have a pretty good idea already. (If not, find the video with the English subtitles.) An excellent combination of aggressive and melodic, of politic and intimate.A great example of hip-hop's power to transcend language."
2,Same Movie as SWEET VIOLENCE - This is DUBBED VERSION,"Kooky fun - I'm sure considered scandalous and decadent upon first release but now a kooky time capsule glimpse at what was considered shocking and depraved 40+ years ago. It is a much more realistic look at teens on break than the ""beach"" movies from the US starring Frankie Avalon. Keep in mind this is the EXACT SAME movie as SWEET VIOLENCE. Difference is SWEET ECSTASY is dubbed with a soft, 4:3 and haggard print while SWEET VIOLENCE is subtitled, widescreen and a pristine print. So, most film fanatics will prefer the SWEET VIOLENCE's transfer to DVD even though it's in French."
2,Needs more Elke,"If this movie was a recipe, I would say, add more Elke. Elke Sommer was arguably the most beautiful German woman ever, the most breathtaking for her time, when there were Sophia Loren, Bridgette Bardot, Inger Stevens, etc. That was heady company. If only the same standards pertained today.The movie is actually pedestrian. To be blunt, I got it because Elke was in it. The producers 'know the score', as the cover to the DVD features our favorite actress prominently. They know that you buy the disk for a glimpse of her or you don't buy the disk.If you are an ELke fan, you see her better in the film with Dean Martin--the Matt Helm series."
2,Poor Mastering Job,"By all means this rating isn't for the album in general, but the mastering job is terrible. They need to re-release this on CD with better sound absolutely!"
2,BAD ENERGY,Extremely disappointing. This item has either being badly remastered or not remastered at all. Dreadful sound. Hopefully Cherry Red UK will pick this up and do it properly.
4,"Intense Rivalry, Amazing Surfing Footage","As an athlete, especially enjoyed learning the sports psych aspects and what motivated and stifled the 2 arch rivals during the first 1/2 of the show. The second 1/2 gets much softer on the rivalry aspect and focuses only on the surfing, so some may want to drop off once they see the relationship better reconciled. Amazing footage of their talent throughout."
5,Sentimental Favorite,"My son almost cried when he opened this gift. I don't know surfing at all, but he does, and he was so happy to get this video."
4,FLY IN THE CHAMPAGNE DVD,"THIS IS A FANTASTIC ""OPEN UP YOUR FEELINGS"" DOC. Andy Irons and Kelly Slater....delving into their souls, voicing how they felt and thought of each other. Not kind and they let you know it...yet after all that....you gotta see this! Each time I watch it, I catch things said that I missed before. Who could NOT watch this? The surfing alone its unmistakable."
3,Required Reading - only for Seminary,Unless you are a seminary student and this is required reading I would not read this book. You may have to read it 2 or 3 times just to get it. It is translated from German to English so it's hard to follow at times. As an Alabama Baptist it bothers me that our own Beeson Divinity School invited him to speak. He's definately not a conservative evangelical.
3,There are better Cosi's available on DVD,"This is my fifth Cosi on DVD, and unfortunately it ranks near the bottom on all fronts - musically, technically and dramatically. It's an antique (by video standards) live from 1975 Glyndebourne Festival, and the technical aspects show - sound is lukewarm, early video capture a bit harsh. The cast is good enough - one would expect no slouches at Glyndebourne - but none really thrill. Pritchard takes things rather fast, particularly in the first act, and doesn't make use of much rubatto. The production is simple, standard and rather bland. Worth acquiring perhaps for the real collector only."
3,Readable but didn't leave me wanting more!,Well written but it just reminded me of why I never liked Bloody Mary in the first place. Could have been a little bit more interesting if Plaidy had included information on her actual death and what happened to the crown in the aftermath. New readers in English History could be left a little confused because the book has an abrupt ending.
4,The surprising heartbreak of Bloody Mary,"Princess Mary is born the beloved daughter of Henry VIII and Katherine of Aragon. But, when her mother can no longer bear children, Mary's life is thrust into turmoil as she is declared illegimate. As she grows to adulthood, she only wishes to bring Catholicism back to England and to marry and be a mother.This is a heartbreaking story of a woman who has been vilified by history. This makes Mary human, something for which Jean Plaidy has a great talent."
1,Give me a break.....,"Yoga and other occult practices have been around LONGER than the xtian God.... it ticks me off that some (notice i said some) xtians still haven't learned the lesson of RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE. Like the old quote says,""It's your hell -- you burn in it."""
1,Pure BS!!,"I've seen demonization, and I guarantee you this lady doesn't know squat about it! I guess she thinks the end justify the means, in that people may more strongly believe the devil exists (which he does!) by reading this far fetched fiction. If you like a nice fictional piece based on the devil, go ahead and read Rebecca Brown's books. If you want a nonfictional account there are much better sources!"
1,rebecca likes to make things up....,She talks like There Under Attack ...it makes me laugh ..she likes to attacking things like board games saying there satan..this book is worthless Urben myth
4,intriguing book,"This book is a must for people who are invovled in withcraft, who are indifferent about the Lord and cruxifing the flesh daily. It not only helps people coming out of the occult life but it also helps the average christian too. Its about a young intern doctor helping out a known new fresh satanist who at first tries to kill Rebecca but in the end under the holy spirit authority Rebecca takes Elaine in and leads her to Christ. It also teaches you how real satanism is and how real the occult life is and how prevaliant it is in our country. Satan is a very clever being and is tricky and it opens your eyes to things that you never knew existed. It also teaches you to leave horscopes, black arts even just the lil palm reading alone. It teaches about subjects of the spirit,soul, will on a level you never thought about. I highly recommended it"
4,helpful,"I am really glad I have ""stumbled"" across this book. It has helped me in understanding spiritual warfare and given me some insight in my own life. Rebecca Brown is very easy to understand and for everything she relies on scripture and her own experiences. I don't think you can get any more real than that.Jamie"
5,It's not for etertainment. It's for protection as a believer,"I didn't believe that this book was boring at all. It was an eye-opener as to why so many things happen the way that they do. She helped me tremendously with some of the problems that I had been having and I'm grateful for the books that she wrote. It's not meant to entertain, but to inform."
1,I know of a much better book if you're interested in deliverance,"I picked up this book today with great interest and began reading it. I could tell right away that it was poor, that this author may have a bit of an understanding about deliverance, but that she's not very experienced and it's not very deep, and she's still a baby Christian, honestly. If you are looking for an unsensationalist but sober and faithful, knowledgeable book about true deliverance, read Unbound by Neal Lazano. He also has a ministry that travels throughout the US and gives conferences. I pray for the author of this book, and I hope she continues on her journey, but I must say that I don't believe she is yet in a position to be considered an authority or an expert in deliverance."
3,Good writer,Rebecca Brown expresses her thoughts and points of view well even though I don't share many of her view points.
2,Making religion into a cult,"How do you form a successful cult? Disguise it as a well-established religion! Seriously, to believe that there is a vast underground network of Satanists living in America who only love to go out and destroy Christians is just as believable as spaceship on the other side of a comet.She's successful at picking and choosing only the quotes from the Bible that she wants, thus always finding ways to prove her point. Cult leaders have been known to do this for years.If anything, this book is a good study of just how far one person can take a belief. You really start to feel sorry for this woman after a while, because she writes with such passion, you can tell she actually beleives what she is writing."
1,P.T. Barnum was right.,"Poppycock. Balderdash. Nonsense. BS. Hogwash. Dillusional. And those are the books good points.Rantings of a mad man (woman actually)? Probably. I am at a loss to find anything redeeming about this fictional hooey.If you hate the Catholic Church because you are as sadly, and grossly misinformed as Rebecca Brown, than this book is a keeper. However, if you have an IQ that registers in the double digits, know anything about the Bible AND Church history, and don't have black helicopters flying over your backyard, then the only good use you will find for this nonsense is to line the bottom of your bird cage or blot the area of your carpet where Fido has soiled it.Want to refute this gobbledygook?

1,Stop Bad-Mouthing the Roman Catholic Church,"Why do all these so called Christians have to bad mouth the Catholic church. Here is another one. I am a non-practicing Catholic but I can assure you the love for Jesus is just as strong or better than any Christian! I grew up seeing my family adoring Our Lord and quoting many times from the Holy Scriptures. So this author and others are narrow minded and ignorant as a bigot. I am sure some New Age teachings are wrong (the operative word here , being some) and of course be careful of these things. Religions are not perfect..they are man made. If it weren't for the Church we would not have the Scriptures. Who do you think translated the Bible from the Greek to Latin? A Catholic ; Saint Jerome! When I picked up this up at a book store, I thought it was going to be something in the order of a Malachi Martin book. Ridiculous."
2,Christianity at it's most extreme.,"This book offers many insights as to how the author feels any true Christian should live, however, non-Christians will find it amusing to see as to just which level Christianity can be taken to. Dr. Brown offers intriguing insights to her beliefs, although the book was intended as a guide, not an explanation of what she believes. What many should find very interesting is that she beleives (nearly) all non-Christian religions, are Satanism in disguise, which is easily seen by the way she refers to religions such as the Hinduism, Ti Chi, and Withcraft as being the same. Also, she makes references to what seems to be a vast underground of Devil Worshippers, although she groups these people with people who are definitely not Devil Worshppers. It's interesting, although tough to imagine what a world would be like if many people actually took her seriously."
5,Prepare for war,"She speaks very clear "" never try to substitute Gods word with nothing, hes the truth, the way, and the life"""
4,Get ready for Jesus Christ,"This book focus on real spiritual warfare, and explains just how rampit satan is, and that he will stop at nothing to fulfill his mission. Satan was sent here to kill, steal and destroy. The next time you see a lot of bad things happening in your life, look a who is actually responsible. Jesus loves, us. Satan on the other hand hates us. He don't care about any of you. The battle being faught now is int he spiritual realm as many of us have no idea that it's exist. Which gives satan control over you. I encourage everyone to read this book for them selves. You must be prayed up in order to defeat Satan."
4,Prepare For War,"This is a fantistic book for those of us who must engage in spiritual warefare with invisible entities! This book taught me more of what I was, and still, must do battle against. Dark forces, elementals, spirits,inter-dimensonal shadow people, demons and nephilim spirits. This book chilled me to the bone! Very informative!This book is a must read for occultist and christians alike!"
1,I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS WAS PUBLISHED!,I WAS ASKED AT WORK BY A RELIGIOUS ZEALOT TO READ A SMALL SECTION WHICH SEEMS TO CLAIM THAT ANYONE WHO IS OTHER THAN A CHRISTIAN IS SATANIC. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHERE SHE GETS HER INFORMATION ON RELIGIOUS BELIEFS SUCH AS HINDUISM AND PRACTICES SUCH AS YOGA FROM. MATERIAL SUCH AS THIS BREEDS HATE WHEN READ BY THOSE WHO ARE NOT CRITICAL THINKERS. I SHUDDER TO THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME WHO MAY TAKE THIS GARBAGE SERIOUSLY!!!
1,"not only have people killed for christ, now their lieing.","I have also read her other book of lies entitled ""he came to set the captives free."" That was the worst trash I have ever read, it is nothing but lies, wake up people, we Satanist do not sacrafice children, or animals to demons, because there are no demons, your god is no more real than the gods of grecco-roman mythology. There is no evil horned head goat out to steal your soul. All that we ask is that if you are going to write about Satanist, don't lie about us."
5,An Awakening!,This is one of the most intense books I've ever read. I wish everyone would read it and become aware of the consequences and rewards of the choices they make and the actions they take. This book has helped me take my spiritual life to the next level.
1,This extreme is just as bad as the satanism!,"I am a Christian who believes that there is a God and a devil. Yet in reading Rebecca Brown's book, I find certain extremes that are not biblical. For example, she advises that Christians who are married to unbelievers sanctify themselves a certain way before having sex with them. Yet the Bible plainly states that ""marriage is honorable in all, and the bed undefiled"". There is no Biblical counsel given by Jesus or the apostle Paul forbidding sexual relations with an unbelieving spouse or having to go through a certain purification process. On the contrary, the believing Christian is to love their husband or wife just as they would if they were Christians, including in the area of sex. That's the only way to truly win them to the Lord. Also, why give the devil so much credit for everything? Jesus has power over him. We need to be careful that while exposing Satan's devices, we do not give him more power than he has. Jesus is STILL Lord!"
5,satan's scheme's exposed!!!,"I believe that if you are truly seeking the vital truths that God father of the Lord Jesus Christ who came in the flesh wants to reveal to you, you should get this book. However it is best obsorbed after reading Brown's first book, or part 1. ""He came to set the captives free"" I had overlooked these books in my search for revelation in regard to spiritual warfare. I was not impressed by the simple titles. Yet After God brought them back to my attention, I was I bought them and was greatly blessed.She also gives professing catholics somethings to investigate.Highly recommended reading."
1,Use for examples of the rhetoric of the literalists,"This book passed my way via a weekend at a friend's house, and it both amused and horrified me. It IS a good book to read so that you can understand the underpinnings of the sort of Christians who so literally interpret the bible, with no thought to context. I mean, this woman claims that VEGETARIANISM is a Satanic plot because God gave Adam all the animals to eat. Hmmmm ... wonder what God would think of factory-farmed pig .... while she is way off the deep end, it helped me better prepare myself the next time I encounter one of these sincere and sincerely uncritical individuals who take every word of the (English translation, mind-you) Bible literally. They'd be pretty surprised to find out what the word ""word"" means in the original, ancient Greek."
4,Like eating potato chips,"Enjoyed this entire series. Fun characters you would like to 'hang out' with. Location you would love to see. And plenty of action. Nothing heavy, like eating potato chips. Not much nutritional value but sure 'tastes' good."
3,Morgan is a softy at heart!,"I love when guys come off as tough dudes but they have a heart made out of marshmallows, especially when the right gal comes along. Morgan becomes putty in spunky Misty ""Malone's"" hands. It is classic to see the fall of the mighty mighty bachelor!These Buckhorn brother's seem to fall fast when it comes to the right gals!Morgan is a sweet, mostly clean book that will have you ""awwwwwing"""
2,GABE HE WILL NEVER BE!!!!!!,"Morgan does not even come close to his brother Gabe! Now there is one Hunk of a guy. This book was kind of stupid in that Morgan was so pushy with Misty, and she acted like an idiot half the time. As I read the book, I kept thinking, okay...lets get to the good stuff, where is the romance??? I'm sorry I probably would have liked this book alittle better if I hadn't read about Gabe first, the two don't compare..."
1,Orthognathic Surgery Book,This book is poorly written. It has misspelled words and incorrect grammar. He couldn't have interviewed many patients to get his information plus the majority of this book is about him being a 'life coach'. It is extremely small and no page is full of writing. I read this in less than 3 hours. Save yourself the $65.00 and surf the Internet. I found more and much better information on the web.
1,Reader should make up their own mind?,"How about this, Mr. Pawson? How about specifically outlining the differences between justification and sanctification, which are two separate issues when it comes to eternal security? I can't believe you would defend the Arminian position.A better explanation can be found in Lloyd Olson's ""Eternal Security."" I'd advise the reader to examine this before believing everything this ""theologian"" says. The reader should allow the Scriptures to make up their own mind."
2,It was ok,"I bought it. I listened to it several times. I donated it to my local library. I hope someone finds it more enjoyable than I did. It wasn't bad. I just didn't enjoy it as much as some of my other Putumayo purchases. I loved Women of Africa, Latino! Latino!, Acoustic Brazilian, Music from the Chocolate Lands, Cuba, Afro-Latin Party, North African Groove, Women of Spirit and Mali. Overall, Putumayo puts out quality products that give you a taste of world music from every continent!!"
1,Not useful or practical,"I am a consultant with 8 years of experience and an MBA, and I found very little of the material in the book helpful, useful, or practical. The concepts are discussed in a very vague and shallow manner, and it appears that Mr. Beitler merely conducted research into other people's theories. Although he claims to have used these concepts with his own clients, and he very well may have, their applicability to today's business world is not at all clear. There are many other books on this topic that are of more use to practitioners.I would be weary of the vague five-star reviews on this page - they all look as if they have been written by the same person."
2,Not my first choice,"I'm sorry to say, mr. Beitler appears to be a really nice guy, but the book is often basic, broad and opinions are not always well fundamented. It is a great source for a lot of researches others did on OC related subjects, however, this book is for a large part no more than a summary of research findings of these others. This book, since it provides a lot of findings, can be helpful for writing a masters thesis. For people who never read about OC before; buying this book can at least give you some helpful insights and a lot of advises for concrete action. For others; maybe Kotter or Burke can be more useful to gain insight in and knowledge of the subject of OC."
2,Not for practitioners,"Unfortunately, this book does not live up to its title.It does provide a brief introduction to quite a number of models, theories and other published material with some explanation to what they are and when to use them. However, it does so rather superficially and the language is never quite right. It attempts to be practical, but never really succeeds; at least not if you have any prior experience with organizational change.It is too much of an introduction with too loose a structure and never becomes relevant in its' recommendations and method."
1,"Very, very light in content and originality","Unfortunately, this book does little to nothing in terms of advancing modern business knowledge and techniques. Extremely basic (may be appropriate for an undergrad college student at best), poorly written and organized, and tools and techniques that any manager either can or already has thought of on their own."
5,Best baby name book ever!,"I'm not a Wiccan, just an open minded person. We wanted something different when choosing a name for our baby. This book had TONS of them! It's really a fun book to read too. I know, who reads a baby name book, right? But really, it was fun. I learned a lot of neat stuff and Wicca sure looks like it's an interesting religion. We both will get a kick out of telling our baby where her name came from. If you know anyone who's expecting, give her this. I guarantee she won't be able to put it down. All the other baby name books were the same old names. Ho-hum BORING! I really like this one better. Plus I actually learned a ritual to help me get over turning 40! How many books can you say that about? Talk about magic!"
4,Powerful insights into magical names,"A well thought out, and very well indexed book about names, the politics of names, and the magic they have. Not just limited to names for children, or adults on a new path, she includes place names, as well. I particularly like the index by trait, which was cross referenced with names that are associated with that trait."
1,A Book that is one long list of names....,"this book is nothing but pages of names,names of gemstones,names of animals,names of pagan origin,names,names and more names...but really hardly anything about those names just brief paragraphs of overall origin but nothing on the individual names listed..it was a boring book, plain and simple and a disappointment to say the least."
1,Bad deal!,Good luck if you want to do a clean install of windows after you buy this computer. Acer's Technical support has got to be the worst in the industry. They have some lame spiel about how they only support drivers for the particular flavor of Windows that was shipped with the computer. Dell provides drivers for other versions of Windows even though it didn't come with the computer. How come they can't provide customers with similar courtesy? Don't expect quality technical support from Acer on any of their product lines.
3,Acer no customer service,This laptop is a good unit but some of the programs I have wont work with Vista. When contacting ACER in Western Australia they said they said they had NO drivers for WinXP for this machine and would only support Vista. Well isn't that amazing when the exact same machine on the Amazon website comes WITH WinXP with the option of an upgrade (thats debateable) to Vista. I find it amazing how bad customer service is at ACER and wont be buying another ACER product in a hurry!
3,Warning for non-Zune buyers: consider the alternative,"Looking for a Y-connector for headsets to use with an iPod or other MP3 player or with a laptop? Consider the following product, which is on another Amazon web page:Monster AICYP 200 iSplitter 200 Mini Y-Adapter for iPod w/ Volume Control/Mute (AICYP 200)The specs for the Monster AICYP 200 iSplitter say it connects two sets of headphone to iPod, MP3 player, laptop, portable CD/DVD/game system, and smart phone. It has built-in dual volume controls enable individual listening levels and individual mute switches.And the the Monster AICYP 200 iSplitter is currently $6.47 less.I don't know if the AICYP 200 iSplitter on the other page is any different than the one for the Zune and therefore can't recommend the the Monster AICYP 200 iSplitter if you have a Zune. But if you don't have a Zune, then there is no reason to spend the extra money (based on current pricing) on the splitter for the Zune."
3,Music from Saturn,Typical craziness from your man from Saturn. A few of the tracks here actually sound like songs while others are a bit more like noisy experiments. This may not be the best album for the first time listener. None the less this man was a genius.
2,Innovative and strange mixture of different genres,"This is one instance where seeing is an important part of the experience as the paraphernalia of costume and theatrics was quite an important part of Sun Ra, so I've been told. This CD is mainly a meeting of African talking drums, tin pan alley and electronic music and most of it is pretty simplistic and boring stuff. The main work is the title track, which is 22 minutes long. I wonder if the enthusiasm for it is part nostalgia as I don't find it especially rivetting. I wanted to hear it to find out what the fuss was about and am disappointed. As a lover of improvised music I find John Zorn's work much more interesting and enjoyable - if you like experimental music in the manner of Sun Ra(though I accept that Sun Ra is a ""one off"") then check out John Zorn's soundtrack work for Japanese films."
1,Music Or Noise?,"Depends on your taste of course. What is music to one may be noise to another. To me this is noise - an atonal, arhythmic sonic mess for the most part. Here and there you get glimpses of melody, but it limps alongside murky, inarticulate accompanient, and goes nowhere in the end. The whole sound is so murky and ill-defined that it's hard to tell who plays what, and what song they are on. This will probably appeal to fans of Cecil Taylor and Ornette Coleman."
5,This guy *was* from another planet!,"This album has two halves: the first consists of 5 excellent short pieces involving Sun Ra, horns and percussion. Some of them are almost funky, a foreshadowing of the stuff Miles Davis would be doing within a few years.The second half, and indeed the highlight of the album, is the title suite. Ra goes mad on the his ""Solar Sound Organ"", providing a highly dissonant solo that builds into an intense climax. (Think Pink Floyd's ""A Saucerful of Secrets"" without all the catchy bits) Then some manic big-band playing enters, and the last minute of the suite presents a neat surprise.This album is highly recommended to adventurous music listeners. It will appeal primarily to free jazz types, though some space rock fans will like too. Beware that the sound quality is extremely poor: sound is muffled, and during the title suite you can hear footsteps and voices in the background."
5,Personal reflections on Ra,"This was my first introduction to the Might of Ra. I wasn't quite sure what to make of it other than I liked it. A few months later, I saw the Arkestra live and it all suddenly made sense. I was hooked and hooked deeply! No, this isn't the best starting place for Sun Ra (especially if you're coming from a 'traditional' jazz background) but for the adventuresome and openminded, this is great stuff.....SPACE IS THE PLACE"
4,schacht3,This is a great book to buy. Their are question about the show that test your mind. And the tattoo look great. To bad the tattoo don't stay on long.
3,Too small for my 42 lb dog,"The Medium Lounger is only 30"" x 30"". Too short for my border collie mix. I exchanged it for a Large.Unfortunately, I like the bed more than the dog. It does not creak when the dog gets on it, like a cot I had finally retired after 1 year of not being used on the deck.At the moment, my dog is still not using the lounger on her own.I am keeping my fingers crossed...The bolster bed in her room took her a while to get used to and now she sleeps on it all the time!"
3,"Convenient small sized hardback, very small type","The price for this hardback was so reasonable that I wondered about the quality and ordered one out of curiosity. It is an attractive volume, so if it is going to only sit on a shelf you will be happy with the ""Everyman's"" brand. If you plan to read it though, and are nearsighted as I am, you may be disappointed as the type is set very small. Also the board that makes up the cover and back is quite thin and somewhat flimsy. I would not buy another one for these reasons. In this case you do get what you pay for. I will add that if one is not nearsighted this would be a good choice as it is small enough to hold comfortably while reading as opposed to some hardbacks that are cumbersome. Also I like that it looks like an older copy and looks good without a dust jacket(comes without) unlike many hardbacks that look terrible when you take the jacket off."
1,Simply Absurd!,"This novel does not rank among Dickens' most famous ... probably because it simply is not one of the best.The plot is completely unrealistic and convoluted. It lacks in continuity and seems to have developed over the months as the novel's instalments were published. All of a sudden, poor characters become rich. Major characters die. A lady in a wheelchair runs out of her house all the way to a prison. Two first cousins marry.The characters themselves are one-dimensional and uninteresting.The whole is barely relieved by few moments of humour.Thank goodness this was the abridged version!"
2,A bit sluggish.,"Not one of Dickens more fashionable books. Can't quite imagine a BBC version! I had trouble with the character of Little Dorrit herself, so humble, childlike and submissive yet obviously showing great strength of character. I really couldn't visualize her. The plot is reasonably strong but would have benefitted from a good sub editor."
2,A teen's review,As much as on my age who loves to read I found this book very droll. I noticed how the writing style seams to read in circles confusing even the 4.0 students that attend my same high school but other than that I found the book a wonderful piece of art work but defiantly not for young adults.
2,Little dorrit,"Since Dickens wrote his novels in chapters and serialized them in his magazine, he tends to be too wordy. This is especialy true for this book. I will hold onto it and try to finish later."
5,So much better than the televised version!,"I bought this book after I started watching the Masterpiece Theater mini-series. I hadn't read this Dickens novel, so I thought watching the televised version would be great, but boy was I mistaken. After the first episode I was so confused about all the incatricies of the plot, that I had to get the book. What a difference! There is no way the mini-series could do this wonderful novel justice. Dickens prose is so colorful and descriptive, and there are so many twists and sub-plots that no wonder I was confused. I think if they had really turned ""Little Dorrit"" into a complete series like ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" it would have been much better. But then, I wouldn't have read the book, so I guess I'm glad they didn't!"
3,Not my favorite Dickens,"Oh Dickens. I have a love/hate relationship with Dickens. I think that he is a great writer but at times he can be kind of boring with his side plots and details details details.I really liked Amy, but everyone around her was kind of...annoying. People were dropping dead left and write, Arthur not only didn't realize that she was in love with him, he basically paid no attention to her whatsoever. Because that's always fantastic.The main plot was mostly interesting in the fact that it showed how money makes people act differently than you would normally expect them too. There was also some paternity drama that could rival Maury, so that part was fascinating as well.It's quite lengthy and kind of a challenge to get through at times. But I think those familiar with the works of Dickens could guess the outcome. I'm not sure If I would reread this one in the future, but it was definitely worth reading through once."
3,Well formatted but a slog,"I decided to read this after seeing it on Masterpiece theater. This free edition is well prepared, but the book itself is slow going."
5,Books at a great price,The price is great - not sure what is up with the funky cover or how it relates to the book title - but it was in excellent condition and shipped fast.
3,A decent Charles Dickens story,"Charles Dickens wrote this installment story over a 19-month period, which probably would have been something exciting to look forward to between December 1855 and June 1857. There were several times where I thought some sections bogged down with details that were uninteresting to me.The story included a mix of plots and subplots -- romance, mystery, a look at high society, a satirical look at government bureaucracy, life in a debtor's prison, and several others. If this were not an installment book, I wonder if Dickens would have included so much in a single book.Overall, I thought the story was OK. I really enjoyed how Dickens used descriptions and dialog to paint vivid pictures for each of his characters. I also liked the overall moral of the story, which revolves around Little Dorrit and somewhat surprisingly at the end with Mrs. Clennam."
5,White Diamonds,"I bought this for my mom for Christmas. She loved Elizabeth Taylor while she was alive, and loves the White Diamond's collection just as much."
3,cost was high,"Surprised by the higher cost & high S/H.Boots are fine, like always.Will buy boots again but consider shipping.Maybe look for local distrib. again."
5,"Finally, the right way to set our hair!","Gennifer Miller presents a proper way to roller set hair for long-term healthy locks. The presentation is informative, well thought out and easy to understand and implement. Truly, as she states, why pay others to handle your lovely locks. The money looks better in your pocket than the ""professional's""."
1,I found a singularity in a book,The contents are what they are. I thought given the price the book manufacturing would do this classic piece justice. It is kind of cheese. My java stained copy has more character. Send this version to the event horizon.
2,Hard on your feet,"This pair is heavy and hard to wear.After wearing for an hour, my feet hurts. Won't recommend to buy it."
3,good in the beginning,the stitching came undone on the arm that holds it on. The customer service person for regalo said he would send me a new one for $20! Ha! I can get one here for less. He said ok fine bye. NICE! I think i will by the chicco one. :P
2,arrived unusable,"i wanted this chair to work, its nice and light and packable. it arrived looking VERY beat up with no slip from the store...which should have been my first warning. i tried to put it together, but there is a piece of metal inside one of the bars that makes it impossible to put together. annoyed that i have to return it, and go through lots of research to figure out how to do so."
3,Not as useful as it appears.,"This chair is not adjustable to the thickness of the table, which is probably due to safety concerns but this information was not clearly stated in the description. However, although i could not use it at home, it is potable and is a good choice for use in public places."
5,Great chair for a great price,"This chair is awesome! It is well made and works great. Our daughter fits great and she loves sitting at the table with us. We were happy to find out it is made in the USA in Burnsville, MN! Love this chair and thinking about ordering another just to keep it in the car."
1,Very Disappointing,My children used to have a chair like this back in the 80's. I thought I was getting something similar. Not true. After trying to put it together (I don't understand why the customer has to do this) my grand daughter (3 months old) could not even sit up in it because it sank like a camp chair. The picture on the advertisement is very disceiving. Not happy with at all.
4,"Baby likes it, but hard to get onto table","For the price, it was a great buy. But it is difficult to get onto and off of tables. If we just left this at home, it would be great, but we take it with us when eating out or visiting family, and it can be a pain. Comfy for baby, a great space saver, but the buckle for the harness seems cheap and may not last long. Overall, a decent purchase.After much more use, I'm upping this to 4 stars. While it still is a bit of a pita, it's gotten much easier to handle after much practice. We take it with us to almost all restaurants and I'd say it will fit on 65% of the tables."
1,Would not recommend,"This chair hasn't fit on any table that I have tried. Bascially if there is any skirt on the table, it won't fit. Great price, but not worth the money if you can't use it."
2,Not worth it!,"I was looking for a hook-on high chair that wasn't too expensive and was easy to clean. I purchased five of them since I am in a childcare center. In the first couple of days, two of them were broken. The spring loaded arm that tightens to the table broke off. They are, however, easy to take apart to clean. Since these chairs were relatively inexpensive, less, the lesson is learned, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.............."
1,didn't work,"I really like the idea of this chair and really wished it worked. Our dinning room table is odd, the extensions pull out from underneath, so i wasn't too surprised it didn't work on that table. I was surprised that it didn't fit on our kitchen table, which is just your standard small kitchen table. I also tried to on our computer desk just to see and it didn't work there either."
2,Okay for the short time it lasted,This worked fine for 8 months until the arm that pulls up to latch to the table would no longer securely lock in place. I also had the same problem fitting to my table as others. There was only one spot it would work because of wood ledges under the table. I would not buy this item again.
2,long arms,"This cute little chair seemed like a good idea, I have owned a chair like it in the past, however the arms are so long that they will not fit on any table in the house. It will however fit securely on the bar. I had mine in the olden days when the chair was covered with something like flannel backed table cloth. You could hand it anywhere and wipe it clean after each use.Now they seem to all be made of something cozy which is nice and all but also harder to clean. I sent mine back and am still looking for the chair of my dreams for less than $50."
3,you get what you pay for...,"its an inexpensive seat and it shows in how it's made. We use this when we're traveling and it works OK for it's purpose. There are 2 ""hooks"" that go under the table and ours are not the same. One seems to be bent making it very difficult to get it under the table in the first place. We own a more expensive one also and it's easy to set up, this one takes time to make sure it's secure, but serves it's purpose. Looking back, I would invest a little more for a nicer one, but at this point we will keep this one for how little we use it. The carrying bag is nice!"
1,Don't bother,"I received this travel picnic seat as a shower gift. The first time we tried it use it we were disappointed that it is only for thin picnic tables. We live near National Forest land, where picnic tables are a good 2 inches thick. So we put it away and made due with our laps while we ate dinner. The 2nd time we tried to use it I followed all the assembly directions and attached it to the picnic table. (At this campsite the table was 1.5 inches thick.) My son started screaming so I went to get him out. It is difficult to remove your child because there isn't much space to use your hands to unbuckle him/her. When I took the chair off the table one of the pins that holds the bottom frame to the rest of the seat broke in two pieces. Again we made due with our laps while our very active baby grabbed at forks, knives, beverages and table food.We bought a Ciao Baby portable high chair as a replacement - more expensive but it's for kids up to 3 yrs old."
2,Welded Poorly!,"After the great reviews I bought this to use for 2 months when we would be away from home. The unit has 2 poles that are meant to be slided into each side of the chair to keep it attached to the table. One pole went on fine. The other one would not slide on, no matter how hard I tried (which scratched it up too.) I stuck my finger inside the pole and there was metal poking into the middle, effectively not allowing the other pole to slide into it. I can't use this so have to return it, hope the next one works better!"
2,Will not work,"This chair will not work with our table. I wish we could have known what table sizes work with this product before purchasing it. The price was great but I am disappointed with this chair. If you are trying to purchase a hook-on high chair, I would suggest purchasing a different product."
2,"So-So Chair, Bad Seams","This chair is okay. It travels well, folds up nicely, and stays secure. I never had a problem with the straps or my children falling out of it. However, the seams came apart after only a year of use. We did use it daily instead of a standing high chair, so I suppose if this seat were only used for travel, it may last longer. I actually ended up going through two of them because I ordered one, used it until the seams came apart, then received one from a relative who wasn't using hers. I've had it for less than a year, have used it less, and the seams are still starting to come apart. I guess it wasn't just my bad luck the first time! I also wasn't thrilled with the lack of support in the back. It wasn't until my daughter was tall enough for her head to reach past the top bar that she seemed to sit comfortably. I have since ordered a new rigid hook-on chair for my son. The point: This chair is fine for occasional use, but doesn't stand up to day-to-day activity."
1,Returned...,"I was hopeful that this chair would be nice, but the poor quality of fabric was really disappointing to me. The chair felt very flimsy and weak, it made me nervous that it would last... I have an Eddie Bauer hook on chair for my oldest daughter and ended up finding another one of those to purchase instead of this one. The low price and reviews lured me in to getting this one, but I ended up returning it. I was hopeful to like this chair, but I did not want to invest in the poor quality."
1,Very Flimsy...,"Needed a hook on to save room. The reviews said that this could be used on a table with a skirt and I have a table with a 3 1/2"" long skirt that is 1 1/2"" from the edge of the table. The skirt wasnt a problem but the high chair would not hook on securly at all!! We tightened it as tight as it would go and the top pieces on the table weren't even flat and tight on the table! Also, the hooks on the bottom weren't even touching the bottom of the table! It was tight, yes, but we were able to wiggle it right off without a problem, not safe at all. And very flimsy - the metal bars that hold the chair together were very loose and the whole construction of the chair would shift from side to side - just scary! I guess you get what you pay for - I have no idea how anyone else had better luck than we did! I really liked the iglesina high chair - much more secure and sturdy, but sadly it did not work on my table because of the skirt."
3,hard to install,"The quality of the chair is good, but it is a little hard to install and not user friend for all tables. We have an antique oak dining room set and it is was hard to work around the board under the table. I really like the clamp on chairs they used to have, but this will be fine for when the grandkids visit."
4,Nice seat,"I had this seat with my 3rd child but someone borrowed it and broke one of the bars. My 4th is now old enough for one of these seats so I ordered the pink Inglesina seat, only because it was pink and the arms that go under the table on the Regalo don't seem to fit many tables. The Inglesina seat has shorter arms but is more money and it doesn't offer the 5 point harness, my 10 month old crawled out of it and was on the table within minutes of putting her in it! Sent the Inglesina back and ordered another Regalo. The Regalo is a nice seat but as I said, doesn't fit a lot of tables very easily."
5,Regalo Portable Hook On High Chair,This high chair worked out great for our family vacation. It was compact and was very easy to set yup and use. I would reccommend this product to arents or grandparents who are traveling and don't want to drag the big highchair with them.
2,Great for short term use,"We bought this as an alternative to a large high chair. After only 6 months of use the fabric is already tearing. Also, because the velcro is not completely covered, crumbs get lodged in the velcro strips and are very difficult to remove. We are replacing this chair today. It is great for occasional use but not as long term gear."
1,Don't do it!,The back bar hit right at the back of my daughter's head and the seat-belt fell apart the second use when I was buckling my perfectly still sitting baby. It's a mess and it doesn't travel easy. I went out and purchased a Fisher Price booster after about 2 weeks of having this seat. Haven't looked back since.
2,"Good, but hard to clean","I love the concept of this chair, and my 11 month old son adores it. It would be great for once in awhile use, but it is so difficult to clean with everyday use.The puffy cover comes off and you could clean that, but the rest of it does not. The cloth arms get so messy, and food gets caught in the crevices. I wipe it out after every meal, and hose it in my sink every couple of days, but it doesn't keep it clean. If you could remove the cloth to clean it would be fabulous. I plan on looking for another seat that is simliar, but easier to wipe down. On positive side, it is easy to hook up, the seatbelt is a 5 point harness so the child stays in securely, and it adjusts to a variety of table widths."
1,Not good if looking for a chair you take and use anywhere!,"I was excited about this purchase because of the cost, look and child restraints. However, I am very disappointed. The chair only works on tables that are two inches thick or less. I think you'll find (like I have found) that most dining tables (whether in restaurants or in other homes) are thicker than this. Also, even if the tabletop is only 2 inches thick, the underside of the table still has to be free and clear for this chair to work. Most tables have another wooden support immediately under the tabletop that also renders this chair unusable. This is only a safe purchase if you have a single, specific table in mind and know this chair will work with it. If you're looking for a universal high chair you can keep in the car and take anywhere--keep looking!!"
5,This is a must have for all parents!,"My husband and I purchased this high chair when my daughter was just old enough to sit up.I really hate using the high chairs in resturants and this was perfect! WE LOVE IT! It stays in my car and we use it all the time, I could not live without it when we are out. I believe this product should be on every gift registry. It is so easy to use and easy to clean. My ten month old loves it!! This is a must have!"
2,Not so easy diner chair,"I was pretty excited to get this chair because I was tired of tripping over my 12 month old daughter's high chair. It was going to be nice to have her eat right at the table with us. I had some trouble attaching it to our table. With our style of table (hidden leaves) I couldn't attach the chair without having at least one leaf up and in use. Once she sat in the chair, she sank to the back. There is absolutely no back support. It was like having her sit in a plastic bag. I rolled up a towel and put it behind her and she was a bit more comfortable. Needless to say, I returned the chair. It just wasn't worth the hassle."
3,Limiting,"Chair doesn't work on thicker tables, which makes it unusable for many of the places we bought it for. Otherwise it is decent."
3,Will work for what I need,"I purchased this chair for a camping trip. Luckily because of other's reviews I made sure to pay extra attention that the bars had been soddered well. I'm glad I did, when I tried to put the chair together I noticed that the side bar part that connects to the top loop piece was soddered poorly on one side. They made the whole bigger than what it should have been, which caused the bar not to lock into place at all(slid right over the locking ball). I ordered a replacement and this new one looks ok. I'm only using this for odd trips here and there, so for the price it was a good deal, just remember to look over the parts before tearing up the package it came in."
3,Hook On High Chair,"Regalo Easy Diner Portable Hook-On High ChairPurchased this chair for my granddaughter. She is ready to sit and eat. The chair is larger than expected. It looked like it should be smaller. It is supposed to travel with the baby so she can sit and eat in restaurants. When the chair is folded it is large and bulky (even 'tho is has a carrying bag). Thinking of all the things the parents have to carry this chair is a bit of a chore. She will use it at home, but I doubt it will travel with her."
5,Great item at great price1,"I wanted some type of personal highchair to use when dining in a restaurant.Bringing baby in car seat is heavy and takes up too much space. Using a restaurant highchair??? NO WAY!! I shopped for some time before deciding to order one of the less expensive models just in case it might not work out. Well, I am convinced that I got a really great product regardless of price! I have tried it on every type of table and it always attaches safely. Baby loves it because she is at the table with everyone.Now, taking baby out to eat is a pleasure for all of us! I think that this dining seat would be a terrific and useful gift ."
3,Does not fit every table,Wonderful portable high chair IF it fits the table. Tables with a lip under them do not work. It did work for our heavy picnic table outside.
3,Worth the cost of the chair.,My son had low muscle tone so we got the high chair for when we went out to dinner because he couldn't sit up in the restaurant high chairs. This chair worked perfect and was super easy to put on and to store. The only set back was our dinning room table had a lip on it so the chair wouldn't work on it.
5,Best Portable Chair,I love this chair! No need to drag along a high chair cover. No need to worry about wiping down those nasty chairs. It opens up and slips on to almost every table. I use this along with a reusable table mat. It's perfect!!!
2,Poorly made,The welding was poorly done and one of the arms could not fit in the sleeve until it was grinded down.Regalo Easy Diner Portable Hook-On High Chair
4,Good item.,This is a good item. I got it for my baby who was not sitting up well in a regular highchair. This has a tall back that is padded so they don't hit their head. Putting it up can be a little cumbersome and it won't fit on tables that have a large lip underneath. I do like how it places the baby right up on the table so food/toys don't always end up on the floor. Carrying bag is also nice.
3,giving it a second try,"We love the overall idea of this chair - it is easy to hook on, the 5 point harness is excellent for our 5 month old, who wants to sit up but still needs a bit of assistance or he slumps sideways. However, one of the tension pins broke on the the third use! We do like the chair so we are going to get a replacement part and give it a second try.Otherwise, we will get the one from One Step Ahead. This product is available in most Target Greatlands, too."
3,great chairs... but has some flaws,"We love the chair but we have some problems with it.Because of the lip on our antique dining room table, we are unable to use it at home. We eat at friends houses a lot and have encountered the same problem with other peoples tables.It is always a risk that it won't fit when we bring it along.Also, it was hard to close and broke very soon after we started using it. We are still able to use it, but one arm rest does not lock.On a good note, it is very portable and easy to clean"
4,good product,"got everything we expected, packaging good, made well Had all the parts needed to install properly. We liked the product"
2,Baby Seat too complicated,This baby seat was very disappointing. I was not expecting it to be so complicated and time consuming to attach to the table. I bought it to take out to eat. It would be very difficult to handle if you were holding a baby and a diaper bag. It can only be attached to a table that doesn't have a wood piece attached to the table top. It has be be screwed on to the table also. I gave it two stars only because the material was sturdy.
2,You Get What You Pay For,I think the chair would serve it's purpose for a little while but the way the arms go together and fold for storage/travel seemed way too cheap for me. The paint on the metal was scratching off when I twisted the arms to fold it. I only tried it on a counter so I can't say how it works on a table with a skirt but I returned it and spent more money for a better made chair by Phil & Ted called MeToo. The Phil & Ted chair folds flatter than this one and is lighter but doesn't come with a travel bag where this one does. I can live without the bag for a chair that seems safer to me. And the MeToo chair does go on my table with a skirt.
1,seat is too low!,This chair didn't get the child high enough above the table. The childs chin was about level to the table and the child is a year old. Not a good purchase unless your child is rather tall for his/her age.
1,"Great idea, bad design","I bought this thinking it would be great to take to grandparents houses and restaurants. Unfortunately, it doesn't work well on a table with a skirt. I have yet to find a table that it works on, so it is really useless. A portable high chair or booster works better."
2,Just ok,"I wanted a portable chair that we could take to restaurants vs using a nasty high chair. It is portable but it DOES NOT FOLD up. You have to dismantle the arms. I would not have bought this chair if I knew that beforehand. Otherwise, it is good alternative to a high chair. I forced the arms to close and stripped the metal. It broke but Regalo sent me a new one with great customer service. It is very sturdy once on our counter and easy to get her in and out. Our baby is 8 months old and I think we can use it for a long time."
2,Concept is great but it's not very durable.,"I wanted so much to love this seat. We purchased it months in advance of actually needing it. The time came to use it and it was wonderful. Baby was safe and secure and seemed to be comfy. The second time we used this when the adjustable arm that puts holds the seat down had the fastener just completely pop off. I wish I'd waited to buy it so that when it broke I would've been in the return time frame, I guess I really wish it had been a little more durable."
2,Won't work on most tables,This won't work on most tables that have a skirt or that expand as the skirt and the slide rails for expansion get in the way.
5,Amazing!,I loved it. It got here fast and fit perfect on my table. My son absolutle loves it. I like that it has a five point harness definite plus.
2,Wish it had fit,"I bought this chair for a vacation and to use at restaurants at home. My baby doesn't fit comfortably in restaurant high chairs, so I was looking for something more comfortable and safer. The fabric is nice and the chair is well padded. The straps are great and secure. BUT I couldn't get it onto the tables. I tried 5 different tables. If the chair went on, it was difficult to manuever. Most tables just didn't work because the table skirt was too big or because the surface under the table wouldn't accommodate the chair. I returned it because it was too frustrating to drag it out and have it not fit."
1,Dangerous,We used this product for less than a month and the middle strap that is crucial to the structure & safety of the high chair came un-stiched and my 9 month old daughter slid right through the middle and onto the floor.
2,Doesn't fit on my counter,This won't fit on my counter because the bottom arms reach so far forward. The item description should include specifications for surfaces to which this chair will attach.
3,Nice but does not recline.,"The Regalo Easy Diner is very compact and easy to take with you anywhere. My son is 8 months old, around 21lbs and he is able to sit in the chair well but when he is tired he slouches since the chair does not have a reclining option. I like everything about the chair except for that the back of the chair is very upright and does not recline. I still think a portable chair is nice to have for a family on the go but if you can find one that reclines I recommend that one over this one."
1,THIS IS THE WORST CHAIR EVER!!!!!!!,I can not even believe that Target sells this piece of junk chair. I purchased two for my twins and both chairs broke. The tention pin broke off of both of the chairs within a couple days of using them. This product does not even deserve one star. Please save your money.
2,Cheap Fabric,"I don't actually own this product but just saw it at Target when contemplating which hook-on chair to buy. The fabric is very cheap feeling and it felt like it wouldn't hold up well to lots of use. The Chicco traveler chair is more expensive but a lot nicer in terms of ease of fitting ot the table and the fabric. There is also more padding for the LO. If you are only going ot use the chair once in a while this one is probably fine, but if you are looking to replace a traditional high chair for full-time use, I'd say splurge and get another brand."
1,Do not buy this high chair,"This high chair came bent so it would not attach to the table. The top bars need to be parallel to the bottom ones for it to attach, and a flaw in manufacturing made the top bar at a 45 degree inward angle. I tried to bend it to fix it, but in the process the holes warped, so I cannot use it at all. I contacted to vendor to tell them about the problem, but they never responded to me to help me in returning it."
1,don't waste your time,"I ordered this chair in March 2010 so it'd arrive by the time my infant needed it. It was to arrive in late April, then early May, and now the ETA is July or August. Don't waste your time. Apparently amazon.com can't deliver on this item and should remove it from their site."
1,Piece of Junk! Do not buy!,"This chair is absolute junk. It was welded improperly so that there is no way it will fit on any table. It doesn't matter how thick or thin or skirt or no skirt. I owned this exact model chair from 2003-2007. It was better quality fabric and the metal was welded together properly. It did eventually break, but after 4 years of hard use. This latest version, while it looks the same on the website, it garbage. I only gave it 1 star because I had to, in order to complete the review.... but it deserves zero stars."
1,Poor compatibility with tables,"We bought this just to leave in the car for those times we would unexpectedly need a portable high chair. Having a similar Chicco chair we expected this one to have the same level of compatibility as we have never had a problem with hooking up our other chair to any table. As it turns out this chair does not work at all with table tops that are either too thick, or have a lip near the edge. This is a huge issue, and although the chair looks reasonably well built it doesn't matter if you can't actually use it. Needless to say we will be exchanging this for a different model."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!,I am a huge advocate of reviews; and read them religiously! I purchased this item a tad unsure because of the mixed reviews. I should have went with my gut-instict! My infant is 18 pounds and fell right through this. Thank goodness I was aware of some of the reviews of this happening so I had a chair underneath and positioned him very carefully. There was no way at all to keep him in this seat. It is very poor quality.
1,"Does not fit ""virutally any table"" as claimed","This product does not fit my kitchen table. My table has a skirt that does not allow this product to work as described. No where in the product description is this mentioned. This may work well on many tables, but I'm still only giving it one star due to unfounded claims by the company of fitting almost any table. I would guess that many others have had or will have the same problem. Regalo needs to be more clear about this products limitations."
5,Love it!,My Mother has a small home and we purchased this so that she wouldn't have to find somewhere to place a bulky highchair but our son would also recognize dinner time and not get distracted. I love this little chair and actually prefer it over a high chair. It is very easy to set up and it is quite sturdy. Our son is 18 months old and will fit in it for some time. I recommend this to anyone but especially for those who need to save their space.
4,Great value for price,"LOVE this seat! I looked at several before deciding on this one and was a bit skeptical because of the price. I purchased 2 of them (I have twins) but planned to return them if they were too cheaply constructed. I was actually surprised at how well they work and how sturdy they are. My kids are 14 months and both like to bounce around in their seats. These things hold firm and I don't have to worry about them falling out or coming off the table. They fold flat and travel well, taking up minimal space. Easy to assemble and attach. They also wipe clean. The only negative is that they don't fit on every table, although I've found that most will work."
5,Great chair!,"We got this chair after our older wooden high-chair tray broke and could not be fixed. We liked it so much we ordered a second one! We keep one on our dining room table, and the other we like to have for traveling! Love it and recommend it!"
2,poorly constructed,After spending many hours checking out hook on high chairs I choose this one for my 20 month old grandson. We were all excited about having him at the table with us instead of in a high chair. When it came I had no problems attaching it to our table and he loved being at the table with us. Two months into the use of the chair we all sat down to dinner and half way through our meal my grandson was laying on the floor under the table screaming. The stitching had let loose on the cross strap and he was dumped on the floor. He scraped his face on the way down and I was horrified. I had gotten one for my daughter to use as well so after taking care of my grandson we immediatly checked hers to make sure it didn't happen to him again. Her stitching is double stitched and is still quite secure. I guess I just got a pig in the poke. Reguardsless I have to give this chair a poor rating.
5,The best!,I had a Sassy Seat 30 years ago for my baby and now that I have a grandbaby this is just the ticket. Very portable and easy to use. Love it so far!!
1,Horrible,"This thing seemed great, but it didn't even last a month. Poor construction, hard to use, not recommended at all"
3,Brand was not very good,"The product came brand new just as described, but the picture shows it clipped onto a table with a lip just like amine and when I go it you can't actually use it on a table with a lip so the picture is like false advertisingb"
1,"Don't Buy This Item, trust me.","I should have taken advise from the reviews that said ""It doesn't fit most table tops."" First of all, it's NOT sturdy enough to dangle a baby off the side of a table. Secondly, the ONLY table in my house that it would work on was my glass breakfast table, and I for sure wasn't going to put my grandson hooked on a glass table top. So ,if you want to save yourself a trip to the post office or wasting your time sending out a review on how this doesn't work, please trust me, you DON'T want to buy this hook on chair. Lastly, when it arrived it was scratched as if I got a return from some other person who returned it."
2,Poor Quality,"I purchased this highchair for a camping trip this summer. When my husbad attempted to assemble it, he noticed that one of the pegs (very important function) was loose and would not stay latched. The highchair was completly unusable because of this so we had to send it back. Overall, it was poorly constucted and I decided to upgrade to the chico portable highchair instead which is more diverse any way. Thumbs down on this one."
5,Excellent seat,"This is a must have for any parent who wants safety and comfort when dining out. The seat is very easy to attach to a table and is very secure. I originally bought a more expensive model, tried it out at 2 different resturaunts and could not get it to fit securely. The material will be very easy to clean and looks so comfortable. My son who is 8 months old and 22 lbs loves it. He can sit right next to us in the booth or table and not be in the way. I recommend any parent purchase this seat instead of the other more expensive models."
2,Regalo high chair,"I was first disappointed in the delivery.It took close to a month for me to receive the product and 2 phone calls to the shipper.When I tried to put the chair together,where 2 metal sides slide together to form the arm...one side had pieces of sharp metal in the arm where it had been welded.This prevented the two pieces from clicking together.I attempted to file down the pieces and was able to snap the pieces together ,but they did not click in place and now will not disconnect!I did try to fit the tableonto my kitchen islad ,which is a big farm table.The chair will not fit,as the table is thick.I then tried it on my dining table,which is thein,but with a lip running underneath so it won't fit.I am sending it back.Very disappointing!!!!"
2,Didn't work tables we tried.,"I bought the Regalo high chair to use when we took my 9 month old to visit his great-grandma. Needed something compact and portable since she lives 20 hours from us. It has a draw-string bag to carry the chair in and lays flat; it packed very well in the vehicle. We first tried it on the bar counter but the clearing underneath the counter was too short for the arm underneath to mount. So we tried it on the dining table, didn't work at all because the table has a decorative wood border that hangs down below the table top - there wasn't enough space between the chair's bar that sits on top of the table and the bar that goes beneath the table - if the table was completely flat without that part hanging down, then I'm sure it would have fit and worked very well. I was extremely disappointed that this chair did not work for our use. It looks like a well made, sturdy chair. Need less to say, I returned it, was a waste of money for my use."
5,Excellent alternative to a high chair,"We never got a high chair and just used the Easy Diner at home. Worked great! I wrote about our experience with this product at Raising An Omnivorous Child on wordpress. Check out ""Front Row Seat"" in the Dec 2009 archives."
5,I recommend this product,I was first hesitant on buying this chair because of the price (its cheaper than others). I just recently purchased a second one to keep in my husbands car. It's quite convenient. We use it for our 14 month old. She seems to like it more than the restaurant chairs. I like it because it folds easily and it has its own bag. It's easy to put together and take apart to wash. It only takes a few seconds to unfold and hook on the tables and a few seconds to fold it back up. You don't have to take it apart. We purchased a different brand that you have to take apart. It took awhile to put on and take off. I'd highly recommend this product.
2,Too bad it Doesn't Fit,Nice product except for the fact that it doesn't fit on our table. Seems like an inflexible design. Maybe it needs a height adjustment on it? We're going to return it and try again...
4,Great deal!,"We got this for our family vacation! It was perfect ! Easy to pack, easy to assemble and clean! It made meal time so much easier...and the price isn't bad either!"
5,Portable chair,This purchase arrived quickly and in perfect condition. It is easy to assemble and adjusts to fit different tables. Te children enjoy sitting up to the table to enjoy their meal with the family.Excellent investment!
3,Ok but doesn't meet my needs,"I was looking for something to use when we dine out, or go to a friend's house. I read the reviews on this and since they were so positive and it only costs $18, I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately my 7.5 mo old son of average height and weight does not fit well in this seat and the seat is not very easy to put on and take off a table. This chair is way too big for him. His back is very far from the back of the chair and he looked very uncomfortable. My husband said he doesn't see this being very easy or quick to put on a table at a restaurant...and his it would be mostly him doing it and he's better with this stuff than I am, I knew that I'd have to return this. Sorry! I wanted to like this. We will probably use a shopping cart cover that fits on a restaurant high chair instead of this kind of seat."
1,Doesn't fit on many tables,"I bought 1 for 3 different people and it only fits on 1 table! It's hard to get on and off also. If your table has any sort of lip on the edge, it likely won't fit. It also won't fit tables more than 2"" thick. It is more flimsy than I expected also. I have a hard seated one that is much better."
5,camping,"We took our daughter, son-in-law, and 16 month old grandson camping on Labor day Weekend. Took the chair out of the box for the first time, read the directions, and hooked the chair onto a picnic table. Fit great on the table, grandson fit great into the chair."
3,high chair,"This high chair is ok, but not quite what I expected. It's easy to assemble, but not very easy to use. So far, all the tables I have put the chair on have had a ""skirt"" beneath the table top about two inches in. The attaching mechanism is not very easy to adjust when attaching the chair to a table. It is easy to bring along, and very useful where a high chair isn't available."
4,Best 1 out of 2,"Having 3 grandchildren with the need to use a highchair when we have a family get together, I thought what a great idea for extra seating. When they arrived I tried one out. It worked great. One problem; I then purchased a new table. My new table had an edge that hangs down under the table, about 4 inches while my other one was flat with no edge. The chair would not unscrew far enough to secure it to the table. Also if your table is curved on the ends it is harder to make it work. Try the sides. I highly recommend this chair if you have the right table."
2,Seat cover falls apart,"This is a good idea, poorly executed. I had a similar seat for my kids, so was happy to get this for the grandkids. However, this one is larger to travel with than my original seat, it doesn't adjust to fit on my own kitchen island due to the thickness of the counter top edge, the seat cover is padded, flimsy nylon, which is impossible to keep clean, and the seams raveled out almost immediately, leaving large holes. It did fit on my son's granite counter, and they have used it, but an internet search yielded no results for a replacement seat cover. The company never responded to my request for availability of replacement seat covers, so we will soon be throwing it away. My advice would be to look for a seat that has a more durable cover."
5,Very good!!,I highly recommend this chair. You can take it anywhere and it's SO strong! I practically stood on it and it wouldn't budge. I would get a second one to keep in the car but this thing is so easy to take off and put on that I can just grab it and go out.
2,Better options available,"As a mother of two with limited space in my kitchen the hook on booster seat is the perfect option. However, this Regalo seat is not compatiple with my table, countertop or those of my mother or 2 sister inlaws. After trying this in 4 homes we decided it wasn't worth the hassle. The problem came where there wasn't enough clearance on our table for the chair to fit securely, or the lip on our breakfast bar was too thick for the safety levers (?) to even screw on. Also, there is a 5 point harness which in my opinion is overkill. We ended up purchasing the GRACO and loving it. simple 3 point harness, fits ANY table we put it on, can take it out to dinner and it is appropriate at all restaurants we have tried. Hope this helps."
5,Why didn't I get this sooner?,"I bought this for my second child after I was sick of cleaning out nooks and crannies of a highchair and looking for something I could easily take with me for meals at grandma's house. After using this chair for a few months, I am kicking myself for not getting this for my first child! It is SOOO easy to wipe clean and my daughter loves sitting at the table with the rest of us during meals. Must-have for moms."
4,Really gritty stuff.,"I gave this a four because it details the aspects of what basically what harassment is and how it affects the victims on the Tennis Club. The coach was a dirty, nasty, and inappropriate individual who should have been removed a while ago. It made me sad but it empowered me and I hope when my cousin is older that she reads this too. I hope she doesn't get too bogged down by the negative overtones but empowered by what the main character does against a corrupt school faculty. The fact she goes to the PA system to expose the coach proves how difficult it is for young women who attend high school, ride the mass transit, and are dealt a bad hand by their peers. Eventually, the principal breaks down and he gets rid of that nasty coach."
4,An Essential Anita Release,"This is Anita O'Day at her finest. This album contains standards interpreted in classic O'Day fashion - with attitude, emotion, and a subtle sexiness. I believe this is a studio recording (there is no audience noise), but it has the spontaneity and freshness of a live recording. I have all the stuff that Verve has released, and I find myself listening to this disc more than any other of Anita's releases on that label. Don't be dismayed by the questionable cover photo; if you love Anita, you will dig this disc. Also, this album contains my favorite versin of ""When Sunny Gets Blue"" - a very jazzy, beautiful rendition."
5,Wolverine ESP in use,"I purchased the ESP 120 after reviewing other similar products.I am cery satisfied with the quality (appearance and workmanship)of the product and the performance.The main purpose for me is to download photographs when on location without PC or laptop. My files are usually large (40 MB+ RAW), and the speed and space (120 GB) for downloads is amazing.It has an FM radio as well.Highly Recommended!Werner Hennies"
2,Wolverine ESP,"Once I figured out how to use some of its features, the wolverine was reasonable easy to use. The manual was not very helpful, so I still do not know how to do certain tasks. Overall, I was disappointed. The LCD resolution is average, but the colors do seem to be true. The switches are not as substantial as I would expect, but they do seem to perform adequately. Next time, I will investigate a little further before purchasing."
2,Interesting Subject... Boring Book,"The subject of this book is quite interesting and the knowledgable authors add many insights into the field of Mergers and Aquisitions. However, the book is poorly written and designed. Simply opening the book will show colorless pages and bland figures that perfectly reflect the tone and content within. There is also a surprising number of spelling mistakes and grammatical errors (something I should not expect if I'm paying over $100 for a book)."
1,Misleading ad...,"If you read the ad, you would think that is would be a paperback version of the text book; don't be FOOLED. It is only the study guide. I bought this book thinking that it was the actual text because of this. I'm not very pleased when it was a study guide. The seller needs to indicate this clearly. I am NEVER buying from this site ever again."
1,Absolutely cheat,"It is a study guide! Not the book!It is a study guide! Not the book!It is a study guide! Not the book!It is a study guide! Not the book!It is a study guide! Not the book!I made a order in Jan and the book came 2 months later. Most importantly, this is not the book, it was a study guide but the seller never mentioned this in the link of the book."
3,Non clear examples,"This is a very good book if you like only theory. However the book need a lot of more examples, with numbers, in order to use this book in a practical way. Also it need a chapter about regulations in other countries and not having a US's only focus in the remaining chapters. In present days M&A are very very internationals."
1,Code Expired,"Received the frog and the code had an expiration date and was expired. I feel so bad for my daughter, because she bought it and couldn't even play it online."
5,Great fun and educational for kids!!,My grandson loves this toy. Can spend hours playing with the toy and on the website.
5,All you need...,"Quick disclosure - I'm a big fan of JUnit already. :) Anything that will convince java developers to use JUnit is a good thing. JUnit is as powerful as it is simple. To prove it, everything you need to know about JUnit is in this 80 page pocket guide. If you are a Java programmer, this pocket guide will easily convince you to add JUnit to your daily development processes. It covers the entire JUnit API, using JUnit with Ant, Extending JUnit, and plenty of suggestions on how to test various situations with JUnit.I liked the descriptions on how to run JUnit standalone or within various IDEs (Eclipse, JBuilder and IntelliJ IDEA). I have been working with JUnit in Eclipse for quite some time and recently started a project using IntelliJ IDEA - so it helped me get JUnit going quickly. I also found the short history on JUnit interesting as well.Whether you're new to Java development or just haven't used JUnit yet, this is the perfect pocket guide to help you get started."
1,Badly planned book,"For a pocket guide, this is poorly planned book. Much time was rather given to why unit testing than description of the API.The author is the father of the JUnit and related frameworks. But this book is just off the mark."
2,Terrible,"This book covers JUnit 3.8, which is reason enough to not buy it. This is not my complaint about the book however, as obviously when the book was published, 3.8 was the latest version.The book is just poorly organized. It lacks a logical flow. It is just snippets of information. You could argue that a pocket guide can't be expected to give a completely in depth coverage of a topic. However the author finds room to talk about the history of how he and his buddies conceived the idea for the framework on a flight. There is plenty of usage of ""I"" and ""Me"" in the book as he brags about his achievements and his testing philosophy. Most of the examples are only a few lines of code, as opposed to a complete java class. You have to figure out yourself which classes have to be imported etc. Ok, so that forces you to think for yourself. But it defeats the purpose of buying a guide."
4,love joshua's swingin' dates,"man this guy swings like mad . disregard anything he may have written (MR. BREAKSTONE) as JOSHUA is foremost a jazzman of the first order . i have this recording as well as ""9 BY 3"" with the recently late , great bass player DENNIS ERWIN and drummer KENNY WASHINGTON , ""ECHOES"" with KENNY BARRON on piano , PEPPER ADAMS on sax , DENNIS again and KEITH COPELAND on drums , ""EVENING STAR"" with TOMMY FLANAGAN on piano , JIM KNEPPER on trombone , DAVE SHAPIRO on bass and KEITH on drums again , and ""SELF-PORTRAIT IN SWING"" with KENNY BARRON on piano , DENNIS and KENNY respectively . you dont get to run with folks like these unless you can play like a mofo (which JOSH most certainly can) . he's dealing . fast company for killin' dates . **** out of ***** or greater for all the recordings listed above . let him bend your ear . you'll be glad ya did ."
1,Be sure to have your wet vac handy.,"On second use the resevoir tank leaked all over our carpet and the dresser, soaking all our clothes. On inspection it turned out the cheap plastic tank body has stress cracks all through the threads that the cap attaches to. This thing is definetly not made to last. The fan is very noisy, and the top forms considerable condensation that drips all over and falls on whatever it is standing on.Pros:Cool blue LED lights.Cons:Cheaply made, noisy, hard to fill resevoir due to poor design."
1,"fast, loud and white dust",this one is really fast but for a ultrasonic a little bit too loud.and it produce a lot of white dustafter 6 weeks I will sent it back.
3,Ultrasonic bionaire humidifier BU2200,"The Unit produces water vapour quickly. It does not have a humidistate to turn unit off when desired humidity level is reached. The sound of the fan is somewhat loud. It would be tolerated if you knew the unit was going to be on for a short period and then off as it is able to produce at a fast rate , hence not on for a long time."
4,Quiet,"This model is much quieter than most humidifiers. The compact design lets it blend in with your furnishings.Sometimes the on/off button sticks, but will reset if you tap it lightly once or twice."
3,Overall excellence flawed by research errors.,"Warner writes well, and her exploration of the deaf world is fascinating. Right to Remain Silent contains serious mis-information regarding ""blue-babies"", and such seriously flawed research on Rhesus-negative that I can only hope the readers don't remember the content. The mininformation in this book could be dangerous or fatal towards your progeny if you are an Rh- woman. (See March of Dimes RHDisease)and (pubs@unlvm.unl.edu for Well Water, Nitrates and the ""Blue Baby"" Syndrome Methemoglobinemia)"
4,Catz Fun,"This was fun to play.You get to take your cats traveling,my favorite place was the Circus.My cat was interested in the balloon pump untill the balloon popped and scare him.I also love the funny costumes.Plus there's alot of toys also food etc.My cat especially likes the pirate hat.You can also talk to your cats using a computer microphone."
5,A Compelling Read,"I met Brandilyn Collins at the 2007 ACFW Conference. (American Christian Fiction Writers) She was such a delightful lady I just had to buy one of her books. (Like I need an excuse to buy books.) I had to limit my purchases somehow so I chose books from authors I met at the conference.Before the conference I had checked out Brandilyn's blog, and read about the trauma she went through writing EYES OF ELISHA. So that's the book I bought. The cover looks rather spooky and while I love suspense and mystery, I don't do horror well. I put it on the back burner and read some of the other books first.Then one day I got brave and read this book. It's not horror after all. Sorry Brandilyn, now I know you have never been classified as a horror writer. To make a long story short, I'm now hooked on this dear ladies writing. No wonder her tag line is ""Don't forget to breathe.""If you like reading Iris Johanson's writing, you will love this book by Brandilyn Collins."
2,"Cheese, anyone?","This book typifies what is wrong with most ""Christian"" fiction. I am a Christian--but I also like to read books with intelligence and depth--this book doesn't have much of either. The plot is see-through, the characters are shallow, and as is typical of this genre, every problem is a ""spiritual"" one. Most characters are ""good"" or ""bad"", and the ones that aren't are wishy washy ""spiritually lost"" people whom we are to pity for their lack of ""knowledge"" about God. The only reason I kept reading after about the 4th chapter was that I was sure the book would get better--I was wrong."
2,Disappointing,"I was surprised to see a ""Christian novel"" with a main character who has ""visions."" Even though her visions were supposedly from God and used for good, this sort of clairvoyance isn't really Scriptural. I see a lot of this sort of thing appearing in ""Christian novels,"" and wonder what accounts for it, except maybe to make them more ""exciting.""The author's writing is okay, although the characters never came alive for me and I thought they were mostly stereotypes. But my real problem wasn't with the writing."
4,Great book; a bit graphic,"This book is truly difficult to review. It's well written, kept me on the edge of my seat, I couldn't put it down, and think others would really enjoy it.At the same time, I was disturbed at the level of violence, because I worry that our culture is becoming desenstized to it, and some of it seemed out of place in a Christian novel. It's not that I expected the book not to be a murder mystery. But it could have been a bit less graphic. For example, there seemed to be no reason for the graphic coyote scene."
1,Full busted with full torso,"The title of the DVD sugests how to learn to adjust your pattern when you are full busted.But to me it was really dissapointing.They only adjust patterns for larger sizes with normal breastsizes belonging to those sizes.Messurements are taken above the bust in order to use one size smaller, followed by enlarging the bust.Then followed by enlarging the tummy and waist area also, and giving it there also much more width en length .For me, a size 8-10 with a D cup and a tiny waist, this DVD does not answer any questions at all.A waist of time and money."
3,"Humorous, better than expected","Early Will Ferrell. Preceeded ""Mean Girls"", parodies of 2-3 other films. A smidge of truth always makes for the best humor. Not for everyone, but I did enjoy it."
2,Sporadic Humor,Pedantic humor (at best) that will garner a chuckle or two. Two hours lost that I won't get back. (Licking trees? Really?)
4,Old school funny!,"Classic ""SNL"" Molly Shannon & Will Ferrell comedy. I had forgotten how funny this movie is. Definitely worth watching again."
2,thin washers should be of higher quality,When you buy stainless fasteners you usually get not only better material but overall better quality parts. This is not the case with this set. The washers are unusually thin and poorly punched/machined. They have a smooth side and a side with a raised lip along the edge that may dig into the face of your project. The lock washers seem OK.
1,Very poor quality,"I purchased these washers from another source and am here on Amazon looking for a better alternative.As indicated by the previous reviewer, the flat washers are poorly produced (but at least they work to some degree).The split washers lose their spring when tightened and thus do not serve their purpose at all."
1,Not at all practical or up-to-date,"This book was a big disappointment to me. The ""styles"" weren't styles at all! I can't imagine a model wearing any of this stuff, or any woman that I know. All of the wrapping and tying and tucking here and there would never stay put if you moved at all, and I don't consider wearing my husband's clothes chic. Save your money and buy an inexpensive pair of maternity jeans!"
2,Cheerful but out-of-date,"Though Ms. Sutherland's tone is upbeat and engaging, her fashion advice is at best dated, and at worst ridiculous. Would you really want to sew a satin sheet into a huge, square, evening dress?! Or wear an oversized men's suit with suspenders, tucking the too-long legs into white socks? Unless the oversized Annie-Hall look is for you, better pass this one up."
4,I like it,"Im using this product mostly for my hair, it keeps my hair soft and supple so i use it to seal my moisture in my hair. This is a great product im liking it alot."
5,Great product!,Love using this oil on my hair and skin! I also use this product on my baby along with olive butter for his eczema. Works well!
4,good oil,"It is fine. It is a bit pricey, and it came a bit cloudy on the bottom but I think it's OK otherwise"
5,WONDERFUL PRODUCT,We love it! We have the single sided one. We researched it and this is the best and the longest one we found. We've had one for 3 years and love it and my son abuses it all the time by climbing over it and it never gives out. We are now getting ready to buy one for our 2 yr old because our soon to be 5 yr old is not ready to give his up yet.
4,Great Bed rail for transition from crib to bed,This is great for our little 2 year toddler who swims while she sleeps at night. The extra length helps keep her safe and off the floor. We just add a nice big pillow at the opening so her head wont dangle of the bed @ night. It's been working great (mommy &amp; daddy are both happy with the added sleep)!
4,"No complaints, really :)","I read both good and bad reviews on this product - like any other product. I chose to purchase it because it was the longest one I could find. We needed one for the full-size bed that one of our twin 2 1/2 yr olds would begin sleeping in. It's been sturdy enough with both twins pulling on it constantly when they get in and out of the bed. It's very easy to assemble. It's not rocket science to flip it down and doesn't necessarily require 2 people to do so, either (as some reviews of this or similar products indicate). I would recommend this to anyone in the same situation as I."
5,Buying a 2nd Set for my CP Kiddo after 12 years of use!,"Excellent product. I'm here today to buy a second set!! I have a 14 year old child with cerebral palsy (cp) and his first set was purchased at target when he was 2. I'm only replacing them due to them being a bit dingy (dirty). They have held up very well! The 56 inch fit almost the length of his queen size bed & have never failed us. My husband even leans on them to pick up our child, and he's an 85lb child!! Very durable, the fold down feature is great for picking up the child, or changing the sheets, or simply to let the room look a bit more normal. The snug fit feature secures the rail under the mattress to the other side of the bed like an L. This prevents any gaps between the bed and the rail so the child cannot slip between. My only complaint would be that the fabric on the top doesn't clean up very well. Then again, after 12 years of use I guess I can't expect them to look brand new. I highly recommend this product!!!"
2,Bad Customer Service,"I just purchased the Regalo Bed rail that drops down. There was nothing in the manual that explains how to drop the rail down. I called customer service (952-440-1950) and spoke with Heidi and she was extremely rude and condescending. After I spoke with her, I tried to bring the rail down then the bracket that feeds the strings fell out! I will not be purchasing any products from them ever again!"
1,Bad design - DANGER,Just wanted to pass this on. We bought this bed rail with the double side add on and it has been a nightmare. Assembly was fairly easy but the locking bars slide together with spring-locked tabs. The tabs face upwards so when you put the mattress on top it pushes the tabs and unlocks the rails. Right now we have it tied in place with twine!!! Have contacted the company and they state that the spring tabs have a high failure rate. Great design but POOR end results..........
4,easy to protect your little one with this!,"it assembled easy, and stays where you put it! i use it on a full size bed and it hasn't moved once. i dont like how it looks, i think it looks a little tacky. but as long as it works i dont mind. my daughter doesn't seem to be able to get it off either. I am happy with this product and would recommend it to others."
2,Does NOT work for deep mattresses....,"We recieved this item today (had to order two because our daughter's queen size bed is not up against a wall). They ended up sending two different models, even though we ordered two of the same model. So that was a bummer...and they looked slightly different too. Then when my husband installed them, they just barely reach over the top of the mattress. The description states that they will fit a queen size bed and the length is OK, but these rails DO NOT work for deeper mattresses. It's not going to keep our daughter from falling out of the bed. Now we're back to square one again."
1,bed rail-3rd rail!,"it came with 2 of the same parts & the guy sent another one & it was wrong again! each time i had to wait 11 days for the wrong part. now he is sending me a new one & it has been 12 days. my daughter is without a rail and this company is awful! poor customer service and next time, come with the right parts!"
1,Did not work for us.,"We had a very difficult time installing the the bed rail - not hard to put together, but running the straps under the mattress was a chore. When it was finally in, we discovered that the top of the rail came only about 4-5 inches above the top of the mattress. It was obviously not intended for thicker mattresses. In addition, the bottom rail was not long enough to stay in place. We returned it immediately."
3,"Works decently, not well made","The rubber insulation is already splitting by the male end. I will have to buy a new one after a few more months, or I'll have to reinforce with electrical tape. For 5$, it's a good buy."
3,I expected disappointment...,"....and that's what I got.I cherished the book and I know it's hard to translate 12 hours of reading into 2.5 hours of movie. I suppose I could say that they tried but if you read the book, then the movie was disappointing. If you didn't read the book, I bet you will be baffled.I just got home from the film. I'm going to take a Xanax and go to bed."
2,Brand New Condition?,"Noticed DVD package was shrink wrapped but did not contain sealed sticker on case. Nevertheless, it looked okay and played fine until got into scene 13 where it not only froze, but wouldn't let us fast forward, reverse, or even skip. Tried it on 3 differed DVD players and had same result! It eventually skipped way ahead, missing some of the best highlights of the movie. Upon further inspection, found faint scratches on disc...clearly not new condition as described."
2,Quality of DVD was poor. Appeared to have been copied,"The DVD seemed to be damaged. Times of no sound, stopped and skipped. Poor quality. Seemed to have been copied"
2,Mediocre movie,"Just finished reading the Hunger Games and am halfway through Catching Fire. First off, the book was ok. The storyline is interesting but left me wanting for more. Now for the movie. I've read lots of reviews that say the movie was close to the book. Wow, not sure what book they are comparing it too as the movie did not follow many of the stories described in the book. The movie does not develop the ""relationship"" with Gale. The death of Rue, followed by the district 12 three finger salute (which would never have been aired by the Capitol) and the revolt/uprising in the movie do not follow the book. The movie makes it look like District 11 revolts, but it's actually District 8 that revolts. There are too many inconsistencies for an ok book that makes the movie not enjoyable. I would recommend not reading the book as this might not bias you opinion of the movie. Glad I watched this as a rental."
3,entertaining film,"The film was true to the book, but somehow lacked the emotions and intrigue of the book. The dvd we received has a skip in it, though it did play back after hitting reverse."
1,HORRIBLE MOVIE,"Although the acting was pretty good by not all, but most of the actors, the movie itself is heinous, and a true teenagers blood bath. In a world full of violence everywhere...a world without any true Christian values...We are presented here with another romantic, bloody teenagers movie....Then we wonder, why our society is in the condition that it is in....I for myself had enough of violence in the movies...As I said, there is already plenty of it in the real world....But, to each its own.......if this movie grossed about $400 million dollars, it is definitely, a very sad illustration of the sick society we live in.....You enjoyed it? Good for you....You will find this dvd in my trash bin at home........"
3,Good movie,"Either I am getting older, or the movie stars are getting younger. I'm sure it is both, but looking back on the classics like Indiana Jones and etc. I think the movie stars seemed more mature. Maybe it is just my persecption. That said, I liked the movie fine, but it is a movie driven towards younger audiences. The cast reminded me of the new vampire movies. Decent storyline and concept, but not the greatest acting. I thought the main actress did a great job, but the rest of the cast were too teeniebopperish. It is worth one look, but I wouldn't recommend buying it."
3,Glad I read the books first,"I think if I hadn't read the books first I never would have after watching this disjointed and none too interesting rendition of what really is a good and one of a kind story. It wasn't just the missing details that movies made from books usually run into, it is just plain not good. Sorry guys, try harder next time. The Hunger Games and Katniss deserves it."
3,eh,"What can I say about a movie that glorifies ritual child sacrifice? It's horrible. As far as cinematography goes, it was okay. So, with the modern cinematographers' technique of the shakie-and-whirling-camera, The Hunger Games falls dramatically short of qualifiying as a movie worth wasting two hours of your life on. Drivvle and poppy-cock! SPOILER ALERT: They change the rules of the game at the end then change them back then change them back again when the kids were going to both commit suicide. I'll let you watch this piece of cinematographic programming to figure out which two characters live"
3,Meh,Seems cheaply made. The soundtrack sucks. The books aren't written extremely well but are more interesting. I still think its worth watching.
3,Too Predictible,"I read the book before watching the movie. I thought if followed the book pretty closely, but I wasn't thrilled with the book either. I though it was very predictable. After all, when the main character in the book is the narrator, you pretty much know how things are going to turn out"
4,Bows and Arrows,I only rented this because I want to learn to use a bow and arrow. This movie will definitely get you excited about picking up the sport.
4,What happened to the extras???,"I don't know about anyone else, but I buy DVD's for the extras. I know the movie - I've generally seen it in the theater before I decide to buy the DVD. Hunger Games did a good job of being true to the story while reducing the potential gore - I really liked that. I also think the cast did a great job of bringing their characters to life.The extras are educational and give a lot of insight about what the producers and director process was, but where was the fun? Where was the commentary with the actors, the blooper real, the challenges? This might seem like I'm focusing on fluff. But honestly, a story like this needs a little levity for balance."
3,Entertaining,The movie was good and gave some insight to what the book didn't detail like how the special effects were carried out. I recommend reading the book before seeing the movie since you'll get a better view of what is going on.
5,"great movie, can't wait for the next one!!",Great movie but recommend reading the book for what was left out. It will be better understood. Make sure you read the beginning lines or you will be lost.
3,Read the book,"I think I would have liked this movie more if I hadn't read the book first. Most of the time, movies just don't compare to the books because books contain so much more detail. In order for a movie to be only a couple of hours long, a lot of detail has to be left out. I was looking forward to the movie, but was disappointed. It felt like a very abbreviated version of the story."
3,A little disappointed,"Good movie but it wasn't nearly as good as the book, which I suppose is typical. There was justtoo much going on to capture it all in a movie."
4,Not to bad,Follows the book ok. Love the different characters. Not so much the acting. Glad I didn't spend top dollar at the movie house.
1,Movie Review,We tried to watch the movie last week and I could not get it to play at all so I would like my money back or send me a new one.
1,Exalt the violence undercover,Kind of movies that teach that violence is ok under survival situations is not acceptable for me.this movie exalt not just the violence but the vanity and depression.
4,Enjoyable,"I liked this movie. I thought it was very well done and well plotted out. I think the storyline with all it's twists and turns would have been difficult and confusing if not done right. This film was interesting and imaginative. I watched it some time ago, but I'm glad I did."
4,Hunger Games,One of the few movies that enhanced the novel. Followed the story line and clarified what the author set forth in the novel. Great entertainment.
2,not worth a review,this dvd is desperate to be orginal and i think it just comes out being plain old stupid. this is one of those movies you cant get through.... silence is better than this movie
4,"Great movie, but","I know many of you are tired of hearing about Battle Royale, but after seeing Battle Royale years ago, Hunger Games just doesn't have the same impact. I felt Hunger Games (the movie) was lacking something. It may have been better for me if it had more emotional scenes and violence to get its story across to the viewers.Overall, I rate the movie highly for the settings and special effects."
2,Decent enough movie,To me this film was a shameless rip off of Stephen King's The Long Walk which was written decades ago. I am not a fan of the movie at all.
2,It follows the very mediocre novel,"Very mediocre film. Jennifer Lawrence is fine in a limited role. The character is just not interesting, no matter how hard they try. And the story just isn't compelling in any way. And worst of all, there is zero chemistry amongst the leads, particularly the 'love triangle', which has to rank as the least effective of all times. Well, at least for such a big budget film.I like Lawrence and for her I give an extra star but otherwise there is nothing about this film I liked."
1,Bad movie,"This movie started out fairly well, with a gripping and emotional storyline. As it progressed however, the characters developed poorly and the ending was anticlimactic. Very disappointing."
1,bad movie,I found this movie very disturbing; the fact that they forced children as young as 12 to take part in the fight to the death travesty was really disgusting. This movie should be banned.
2,Dumb,"So many improbable things going on here. Too many to list. The cartoonish costumes worn by the Stanley Tucci and everyone else watching the Hunger Games, set the tone immediately for me. I couldn't take any of this drivel seriously."
1,Really.. Kids BRUTALLY murdering kids?,"Im not a religious person or spiritual person by any means and am rarely offended but this movie is disturbing.How any adults, especially adults with kids could approve this for their kids is crazy. Kids murdering kids is NOT ok in any form."
2,I GUESS IT'S GOOD IF ONE HAS THE MENTALITY OF A TWELVE YEAR OLD,"The ACTING is GOOD TO SUFFICIENT, at best. The SUBJECT MATTER is SOPHOMORIC. I am, obviously, in the minority , but GEEZ. AND the BRUTALITY?????? What's the appeal?????? How much different is it than the WWWF????????I think Jennifer Lawrence (Winter's Bone), Stanley Tucci and Woody Harrelson are, ALL, really good actors (among my favorites, actually) and they all were good in this movie. That's the best I can say. The story line and script are so poor, Good is all that can be expected. The special effects are not special--they are poor, also. This was highly recommended to me. I would HIGHLY NOT RECOMMEND IT!!THE BOOK WOULD HAVE TO BE BETTER. HOW COULD IT NOT BE?"
4,Fairly good movie but plot is a bit off,"Good move with all the elements in it for action, love, betrayal, suspense, and sequel ending. However the plot in general left major holes. 12 districts that rebeled against ??? I can't even remember it was so light with no real meaning. Now the districts are basically slave labor for the primary civilization which has extremely advanced technology over the 12 districts which look like they are living in the late 1800's to early 1900's. While the primary group is living in the year 3000 technology. But yet when a riot breaks out they use water cannons instead of future tech stun guns or weapons? Did I miss something? Also why did none of the warriors I'll call them just follow the parachutes bringing items from sponsors? They make a loud noise so everyone can find them? Also sponsors of what? The movie was good for action and so on, but don't be expecting some great story or plot it just isn't there."
2,Doesn't meet expectations,The plot line is too simple the heroes are not sympathetic characters and the same smarmy female archetype is used.
2,"No Guts, Little Glory","Once again, commerce beats cinematic art. A potentially great movie is buried in this watered-down adaptation of Suzanne Collins' futuristic bestseller. Despite a memorable cast and imaginative production design, the filmmakers lack the hard edge and tight pacing to deliver the goods. Director Gary Ross' reliance on shaky camera work (combined with his choppy editing technique) evades the novel's harsh violence and dramatic tension for a safe PG-13 rating. Rather than going for the sociological jugular, ""The Hunger Games"" pulls its punches. Hopefully, the 2013 sequel will benefit from stronger direction and less filmmaking by committee."
2,Need to read the book to fully understand the disappointment of the movi,"I read the series and if I hadn't this movie would be a lot more confusing. There is no real explanation and character information. The books were much better and easier to understand what was going on. I wish we could have enjoyed more of the grandness of the game preparation. The transitions didn't work well and were too quick, but the movie seemed long because they dragged out scenes that made no sense to those who didn't read the book."
5,Good reading!,"I was happy to get this series on my Kindle, so I could read it before the 1st movie came out!"
4,Good quality,I was a little worried that it didnt come wrapped in its original packaging but the movie was fine and wasnt scratched or looked like it was used. Was very happy.
5,Follows the book exactly,The acting and selection of actors is flawless. The movie is superb I would recommend that anyone that loves sci-fi see this movie.
5,Hunger for more Hunger Games! Great Movie!,"Overall, ""The Hunger Games"" was a really great movie! Jennifer Lawerence was outstanding and is a rising star for sure.I read the book before I saw the movie and for the most part the movie did a really great job of following the book. Watch this movie. You will like it."
3,Hunger games,The movie was good but not as expected. There was too much anticipation for this movie that it affected the viewing.
4,never judge a book by its movie,the book was of course a thousand times better...should watch movie first..then read the book...that way the movies wont be such a disappointment
3,This movie reminded me of something.....,"Why did this movie remind me of another movie that was made years before the book was written and twelve years before the movie was made....the movie I talk about it ""Battle Royale."" Because I could not get over that fact, I gave the movie three stars. Although an excellent movie, it can never live up to Battle Royale. Im still going to get the movie so that must say something...."
5,Great movie and very telling about the way society could become,Great plot and very good acting. Not appropriate for children under the age of 15 or very sensitive children as the thought of children killing children for the amusement of adults it not one to which I would subject young children. All in all though a gripping look at government gone amuck. A modern day decadent Roman culture movie.
5,Great,"Great overall movie. Very interesting film opening you up to a different world Filled with joy, tragedy and unique characters."
3,Would not spend the extra for HD again,"Purchased this through PRIME streaming video and paid extra for ""HD""....... The quality was not HD quality and I stream wired so there was no excuse... Won't make that HD mistake again. I would stream in standard definition...."
3,"Dark, very dark.","This is a movie about a future, post a civil war in the United States. As a punishment for rebellion, the factions must submit a boy and a girl aged 12 through 18 by lottery to play the Hunger Games. The object of the game is to kill the other contestants. This is all great entertainment and quite a spectacle for the wealthy ruling faction. I have read the books, and it followed the book well. I am appalled, however, that this is marketed towards kids. It is way too brutal and scary for children. Please don't let your kids watch this!"
2,ok movie,decent acting. horrible directing. this was yet another movie that tries to capture fear and/or panic by using the shaky camera effect. just ruined it for me using a technique that should have died with the 90s. story was ok but ive seen/read it before - the running man. the long walk. the truman show.
2,DVD skips,"Ok, the movie is alright but the DVD skips an entire scene. This DVD is not scratched, warped, or altered in any way. But it skips an entire scene. We returned it and asked for another disc. The second one did the same thing. I don't know how this got through quality control, but you can be sure I'll be reading more customer reviews before purchasing a dvd again."
2,Skip it,"Lottta hokum!! Strictly for the teen crowd. Bad acting, bad scenery, bad story, and a lot of scene chewing by Stanley Tucci"
2,MOVIE THAT WENT NO WHERE...,"Long story short: did not like this movie, was boring, dragged on forever and not even violent. WHAT WAS THE BIG DEAL ABOUT THIS MOVIE?!!!."
3,Hunger Games DVD,The book was Sooooo much better than the movie. this skims across the surface of all the things that made the book such a great read. If you have not read the book you should prior to watching this film.
3,Not that great of a movie,"There have been only a handful of books, made into movies, that have ever been worth watching and this was not one of them. This movie appealed to those that read Suzanne Collins ""The Hunger Games."" If you didn't read the book and you watched the movie you wouldn't get the full experience of what's happening, why it's happening and how it affects the participants.Personnally, I wouldn't suggest watching this film, but to read the series."
3,The Boring Games,I expected more before watching this movie. It has a lot of loose ends and leaves you hanging. I would definitely suggest reading the book(although I have not) just because friends of mine have told me it helps tie things in when watching the movie. I also like many people do not like the concept of children killing children and I understand it is just a movie but just not my kind of movie.
2,The Hunger Games - A Disappointment,"In my opinion the movie spent entirely to much time in the preparation for the games and not enough time in the games themselves. The opportunity was there for a pretty exciting movie but was wasted on boy-girl relationships. I was expecting a lot more Hunger Games themselves....Like I said, there was a lot of possibilities and much of the movie time was wasted..."
2,Why all the hype?,"I can't believe I bought this movie. Seriously, the premise of kids killing kids to bring honor to their districts. Glad I did pay to take my family to see it at the theater."
2,The girl cannot act.,It was too off the wall for me. Too much hipe for this movie. Not worth renting.To each his own. I just didn't care for it. Why don't they make good movies anymore....
2,Too predictable,The movie was too predictable. Hopefully the next ones in the series will have better story lines. I wasn't impressed by the special effects.
5,The Hunger Games,The movie is as good as it was presented when it first came out in the theaters and certainly kept me on the edge of my seat during some scenes.
4,the hunger games,"Kinda slow to start with, but it get better when they get the games started. I would recommend this movie to anybody!"
5,Great story and well done.,I really enjoyed this movie. The story is great and the acting also. I look forward to seeing some sequels.
5,"Amazing book, with a great movie!","I've read the whole series, and the books truly are amazing! Usually, when I go to see a movie after reading such an amazing book, I am disappointed at how far the movie detours and detracts from the book. In this case, they really did seem to try to retain as many of the details and facets from the book as possible. The movie maintained the feel and purpose of the book. I would be curious though if those who did not read the book caught many of those details, but the movie seems like it can easily stand on its own as well. I'm very much looking forward to the next movie!"
2,Should have known better.,"I read a lot of books and generally dislike the movies that are made from them. In this case I was caught up in the hype of the movie, not sure why as I never finished reading the first book as I was not interested in it at all."
4,good but cheaply made book,Ok so haven't read book but plan on after seeing.movie. sad concept..children killing children for adult entertainment...what kind of society do we live in?
5,Excellent product and adaptation,"The movie was very well adapted from the book. As with any adaptation, there were small differences, but with the special features on the blueray, the differences are explained, and accepted by the book's author.That was one of the bonuses of the making of the movie, having the author give the screen writer's the options to come and explain their changes, just so the movie's flow worked without slowing the storyline."
4,Decent movie,"Having never read any of the books but hearing raves about the movie, I thought we would watch this one. It was entertaining and we enjoyed watching it."
4,Good movie,Don't usually watch teen movies but am a fan of Jennifer Lawrence since I saw her in Winters Bones. Good movie.
3,The Hunger Games,"Although the premise is a little scary (children killing children in order to survive), it was well done, and I look forward to the next one."
3,Should have watched Battleship,"At least if I had used my credit on renting Battleship I would have got what was expected, explosions. Instead, I opted for manufactured situations and not enough death and gore. Please, save your time and buy the special edition Battle Royale blu-ray set."
2,Watched this recently and was disappointed,"Watched this recently and was disappointed. Not sure what all the fuss was about. The girl with the bow & arrows - I think she used it twice the whole movie. This wasn't a bad movie, just kind of predictable and some of the characters overreached."
2,why do so many people like this movie?,"the acting is alright. the effects are absolutely average and look like some 9th grade computer class created them. the movie made soooooo many cuts from the book that it doesnt flow well at all. as a huge fan of the book, i am really diappointed with this film. lets hope the next film will have some decent special effects and stick more to the book."
2,"Digital copy doesn't work, ultraviolet is crap","I love the movie and the blu ray is great, however this gets 2 stars because the digital copy is via ultraviolet which after several days still won't let me even get past the create an account page to download the movie. What's wrong with just doing the digital copy on a disc with a code to unlock it?"
2,Skips!!,"Ok, I bought this movie and it came on time and was packaged safely. Me and my fiance was super excited to watch this movie. We were about 1/4th into the movie when it started skipping on us. Was very disappointed with this purchace!"
2,Meh.,"It's pretty mediocre, but the acting wasn't too objectionable. I'm sure that, had I read the book, I would have found the movie to be even less enjoyable. In summation: don't expect much if you aren't already a fan of the series."
4,Great movie!,We ordered this movie over Christmas and enjoyed watching it. It arrived in a timely manner and was a great movie for the whole family.
4,Great Movie,"I have read the books and as one could expect the movie doesn't follow the book 100%, but it still does a pretty fine job and I felt the movie alone was well made. Would recommend to anyone whether or not they've read the books or not."
4,Better Than Most Book to Film Movies,"Like many people, I love the books and looked forward, with some trepidation, to the DVD coming out. So often books to film are changed so much that it doesn't even seem to be based on the book. Yes, inThe Hunger Gamesthings are changed and things are omitted (what's with Peeta's leg?), but so much is right on, that it is easy to forgive a lot of those little changes and omissions. I thought the roles were played just right... not over acted or underacted. Probably the only thing that I had to really adjust to was that Peeta did not look at all like I had envisioned him... but they couldn't please everyone and if Suzanne Collins didn't have a problem with it, then who am I to differ."
4,Good movie but book was better.,The movie was good but the book was much better. It is hard to decide what sections are important to include but the movie was not as good as I had hoped it would be.
3,Big Production,"I didn't read the book, so just watched the movie. There may have been some things from the book that would have helped fill in the blanks. It was certainly not boring to watch, just generally not our type of movie."
4,Hunger Games - Movie,"Enjoyed the movie very much, although having read the books was really helpful in understanding the story because so much of the background material wasn't included in the movie."
4,Great Movie,The movie falls short of the book but it is still a great movie. I can't wait for the rest of them to come out!
5,"Love the movie, love the books","If you liked the books, you'll enjoy the movie. It stayed as close to the book as it reasonably could within the time frame. It was very well done and I recommend it."
5,title missleading,"I was shocked to learn that this movie was not about hungry hungry hippos. New title, ""lord of the flies, vs robyn hood"""
3,The Hunger Games DVD,"I loved the movie, but the DVD would freeze up at several points the first part of the movie!Very disappointed in the quality.I see no scratches or nicks on it, so I don't know why it does this. All my other DVDs do great.I didn't return it for another because my printer isn't working to print out the return label."
5,Teaches great values!,"In tough times never forget who you are. Maintain your virtues, your values, your honor. Excellent movie! This movie has great character development."
4,Good Weekend Night at home with the Teenages and Parents,"Movie had good video and sound quality. Editing was average to rough, causing confusion to the viewer in places. Movie should have had about 10-15 minutes put back in that were probably left on the cutting room floor. Additional scenes or longer scene transitions would have made the story line smoother. Parents, do not let pre-teens or youger see this. Movie should have had an ""R"" rating due to the violence. This is a ""Lord of the Flies"" type movie without the class or insights. Characters are flat with little development. Overall, a good mindless action movie for adults or mature teens for a stay at home weekend."
4,Hunger Games,"We enjoyed the storyline and cinematography. Where was this filmed? Wondering if there will be a sequel, i.e., 76th Hunger Games..."
5,Great Film~Great Book,"Saw this opening day after having finished all 3 books. Loved the movie very much. I think they did a brilliant job capturing the novel on screen. Bought the dvd, first one after buying my new big flat screen. My BFF hadn't seen it yet..she LOVED the film(never read the books). How do I know this film was good, just like I know when a book is really written well..makes me laugh and cry. Even though I read the book, and had seen the film twice, losing Rue was heartbreaking...that scene will ALWAYS make me cry. Such a great film!"
3,A Winner,"Very good video. I would have given it a 5-star, except for the fact that it left out too much of the story. I reccommend that the individual read the book first. Then the characters stand out more, and the movie watcher can follow the story better."
5,Great movie!,"My kids and I all enjoyed reading the book series. It was also a really good first movie. That's not always the case with great stories you have read, and then the movie does not do it justice. This was a really good movie, too. Can't wait for the next movies to come out."
5,Fighting for survival,"This movie takes place on another planet, but has an overall story line of our current Earth and how some countries treat their people. There are many scenes that preach messages that they try to hide in the overall story. The movie is great because it has a fantasy quality that is like watching a Dungeons and Dragons game play out in real life, on a different, but similar planet.Oh, did I say it takes place on a planet? They seem to leave it up to the viewer to decide if the movie is on a planet, if there is magic, or as any Star Trek fan would immediately recognize as a holodeck.This movie is worth owning."
4,Could Be Better,"I was somewhat disappointed in the content, as I had waited so long to get it. I read all three books and the dvd had eliminated some key points that made one more aware of the nuances the books put across. Nonetheless, it was well done, if you had not read the books first."
2,The Hunger Games,"This is a very sad movie. Young people thrust into a killing mode for the sport of others. How sick are we getting [or have gotten] as a society? We need to stop making these types of movies and start making movies about saints and holy, upright people as models to be emulated. Violence begets violence. Is that what we really want for our society?As far as Amazon is concerned, the product was delivered rapidly and in great condition. Very satisfied with Amazon."
4,Lives up to the hype,Pleasantly surprised by the quality of this film. Enjoyed it and will now read the books so I'll be ready for the next one.
4,hunger games review,this movie is a very well acted movie...close enough adaptation of book...action packed...if the nex one is as good I looking forward to second installment...
4,very interesting,"well done on this topic that has been around scifi for years, refreshing in its approach to the subject, enjoyed it"
3,Mediocre at best!!!,"While the story line is interesting, the acting is terrible. If I had seen this at the theatre I would not have puchased this from Amazon. Amazon did have the best price though."
2,"Well acted, but predictable","As an adult, I read and enjoyed immensely the Gregor series by Susan Collins. I did not read the book, but I'm guessing it's better. I found the movie just a bit trite. I know it's a young adult story, but so were her others which were quite good and not at all predictable."
3,"Not like book, moved to slow and lost main plot.",I hope the rest of the series follow the books more closely. I am waiting for the next movie in the hopes that it will be better.
3,Video cut out,"Everything was awesome until about 11:00 PM with about twenty five minutes left in the movie. At that point the streaming stopped cold and a call to Amazon the next day put the fault in their corner. They did not offer any kind of refund or extension of time for the video to be viewed so let the buyer beware. In Amazon's defense, this is the first problem I have encountered when streaming from them.I give the movie five stars and the viewing experience from Amazon zero stars since the movie stopped streaming. That explains my three star rating."
3,book was much better,"i was disappointed because the book was riveting and there should have been more special effects.the film leaves you hanging and buyers are forced to wait for part two that has not begun to film. i was under the impression i bought the complete story.there also was no action in the arena compared to what i read. i don""t know if i would purchase part two, too dull"
5,Wonderful!,So happy! not only do I have the movie I got the how it was made and a digital version of it! Thank you AMAZON!
4,fabulous,I read the trilogy before seeing this movie. Although I really liked the movie I would have loved it if it were longer or in 2 parts to fit in more from the books! Excited for the next one!
2,"Concept good, execution only OK",Would appeal to teenagers like most movies these days. Adult characters are parodies and stereotypes. The story is interesting but the dialog is stilted and clumsy and preachy.
4,Hunger Games,Wonderful movie...great casting!I didn't expect that the movie would be able to portray the book as well as it did. The director could not have found a better Katniss! Looking forward to the sequel!
4,Good movie,Enjoyed the movie. Acting and scenery were well done. Stayed true to the book for the most part. Looking forward to the next movie in the series.
4,the hunger games,I like a movie that will keep me glued to the screen until the end and leave me wanting more. I can't say that I liked the games they were forced to participate. I just pray that this will never happen in the real world.
5,Great Movie,"Great Movie, very true to the book. Minor changes, but doesn't distract from the story. Great special effects. Behind the scenes is very interesting, recommend."
3,Hunger Games DVD,A decent flick but far less in both content and excitement than the book. Worth a look but I'll not buy the next episode until I've rented it for a first look.
3,Good movie hampered by the dumbest premise ever,"Everything about this movie is good except for the fundamental premise. Why would anyone think that a good way to pacify a subject people would be to kidnap their children and televise their gruesome deaths? This is the absolute opposite of reality! Every time I was getting close to losing myself in the movie, I would remember how absolutely moronic the basic premise was, and out I would come. Despite all the good qualities that this movie does have, I can't imagine watching it a second time or watching a sequel. It's just not good enough to make me forget what utter nonsense it is."
2,Movie Review,"Received the DVD in super fast time and was in new condition.I will buy from this seller again.Action movie but, I did not care for the story line of kidskilling kids for entertainment of a group of future people.The actors did a good job of acting in the movie.I will review the DVD that I am buying in the future.My rating is on the movie not the seller who was great 5 star."
2,Very Boring,"Read the book and while I thought it was pretty juvenile, it was very entertaining and exciting...the same cannot be said for the film. There was a lack of action, the sound editing was horrible, and they skimmed over some very important character development. Watch it if you must but it's not worth ruining your reading experience. Hope they get a new director and crew for the next two films - they did quite an injustice to the cast."
2,Hard to see what all the hype was about,The movie is no different than much of the drek on the SciFi channel. Don't see what all the fuss is about.
3,It was okay...,"I have not read the book, and I have been told it is better than the movie. I guess for me, they hype surrounding this made me expect a lot more than what I saw. I plan to read the book now -- if anything, just to see if it is better."
4,Better the 2nd time...,"A fan of the books, I was let down the first time I saw the movie. Not alot of developement of the interrelationships between the characters. When I gave the movie another go, I found it to be alot better than the first viewing, and if you're a fan of the books, you'll probably want to have this in your collection. The digital copy is great for us...we like to take them camping, and watch them at night in the tent. Good buy."
4,Hunger Games movie,good movie ............. ......... ........ ........ ........ .......... .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..
3,"just so so, didn't do the book justice",I thought that this film was good just not excellent as I expected it to be. I think they fell short on some of the character developement and especially the relationship between the two main characters seemed to lack developement and depth.
5,Hunger Games Movie vs Books,"Movie was good, but I enjoyed the books so much more, I was almost disappointed in the movie but understand that the books can carry so much more depth and can give more detail. All in all I still enjoyed the movie, just don't read the books first. Read them after you watch the movie."
4,Ending left us Hanging,I read all three books so I know (or Hope) the other two movies are in production. I just had to explain this to my friends who watched this with me.
5,Fun Adaptation of the Book,"I really enjoyed this film adaptation of the book. The action was good, and all the right parts of the book were represented. I can't wait for the next one to come out."
4,Fast read,"I am not much of a sci-fi fan, but read this so I would know what my grandkids are talking about and found it held my interest. I recommend it."
3,Ok if you like teenie bopper movies -,Read the books and just wanted to see what they've done with them. Nice try - will be seeing the rest just for the curiosity.
3,Action pact adventure,This movie will leave you guessing. It's great to have for that person who likes a good love story adventure flic.
3,"Ok movie, hope follow-ons improve the storyline",Did not read the books so it was a little hard to understand the premise of the story but by the end you have a decent handle on what is happening.
3,It's okay.,"Its a bit slow for me at the beginning but over all it was a good movie, I was able to watch it all the way through without having to get up and find something else to do."
3,The Hunger Games,"This movie had really good acting and talented actors. The story was interesting and different. But I only give it 3 stars. The movie was kind of disturbing to me. I guess i just didn't realize that it was going to be so violent towards kids. A well made movie, I just didn't like the subject matter."
4,goof flick,Interesting movie but a little dissappointing from all the hype. The actors and characters of the movie were well played.
3,ok,"It was ok. From all the hype I was kinda expecting to be blown away. I didn't really feel like I ever really connected with any of the characters. The whole movie seemed kind of...shallow...maybe? Not the best movie I've seen by far, but it was somewhat enjoyable to watch."
3,Not as good as I expected,"I had heard so much about the book series that I thought it would be really good. Then when I watched the movie, It was not as good as I thought it would be. That's just my opinion, maybe some people are seriously in love with it, but I just wasn't."
4,The Hunger Games,"The movie was good but not as great as the book, of course. In spite of this, I would still recommend you watch it."
5,Best book to movie transfer ive ever seen,Read the books then buy the movie. They are great wonderful and the best book to movie transfer I've seen
3,Dissappointed,"As a real fan of the books(I've read all three), I was eagerly looking forward to the release of this film. However, the whole look and feel of the movie lacks the depth and richness of the books. The so-called romance between Katniss and Peeta lacks any real fire."
5,Great Movie,"Really just a great all around good flick, Never read the books but I from what I gather its pretty spot on."
4,Leaves me Hungry...,"**This is a review of the Hunger Games 2 disc BD**Hunger Games books - great. The film, almost as good (which is meant as a sure compliment). Every actor was choice perfect. My main problem is the fact that I wanted to watch the next movie RIGHT THEN. Better editing? My next 'gripe' is the special features: while there is a sizable collection, but everyone kept saying the same thing - so and so was amazing // can I compliment some one else more than they have already?So, while I cannot complain about anything, I can find anything that makes it stand out either. Yes, it is an above average presentation. I guess I'll 'finish' the review properly, when the next movie is made. And at the end of the day, this film is perfect for fans.My complaint is minor. Read the books. Enjoy the movie. And we cannot wait to see the next one."
5,fun story,heard the hype and went for it any way. it was worth the time and money. fun and interesting story.
2,Not Too Appetizing...,"Joyless, predictable, and silly! A rehash of what's come before in different forms from comic books, movies, television, and even video games etc. THE HUNGER GAMES is depressing and not fun to watch. This reviewer just didn't care for any of the characters either. Just put on the superior THE RUNNING MAN with Arnold Schwarzenegger and enjoy the ride. At least there's humor without a bunch of whiney brat-packers running around, and it doesn't take itself too seriously!"
3,Entertaining Enough,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS:The story is interesting although it's been done before. (It's like ""Running Man"" with kids instead of adults.) Also, the way the citizens of the Capitol viewed the Hunger Games as entertainment is similar to the ancient Romans watching gladiators.The things that took away from the movie:1. Shaky camera. It was used to make up for the lack of gore that would normally be seen in a massacre movie. The audience couldn't tell what was really going on in the fight scenes, which is exactly what the producers wanted so a PG-13 rating could be put on the movie as the target audience is that age group.2. Lacked character development. As the characters get killed, no empathy emerges, because the audience hasn't been given much background on anyone except Katniss.3. It does have some implausible moments such as computer generated beasts being able to attack and kill."
1,Not what I was expecting,"Does everything have to be a fairytale of love that's over-rated. The intro into the whole plot was long and boring, where common sense is a ? Like if put in a deadly situation, the touch gets going and get it over. Not what shall I do now."
3,THE HUNGER ASS BLAST,Get blasted in the ass by the Hunger Games. Your friends will bewilder you by how much of an ass blast they will feed your butt.
5,great,video service was great! did a pre- order and was able to watch movie on the release date got hard copy as scheduled!
5,The odds for enjoyment were in my favor,"The thing I liked best about this purchase was that the digital copy was automatically put in my Amazon Video Library at Midnight of the day it was released. I watched it the first time on my computer at 12:30am. This was a fun series of books to read, especially the first two volumes. I am looking forward to the next release. Only sad it is over a year away. Definately worth it!!!"
3,Found it kind of meh.,For tall the hype I was expecting something with a bit more depth and quality acting. It was just OK. Kind of a mindless evening of entertainment.
3,Good but slow,Very long movie. Seems they found of cut out a lot in the beginning to make it shorter and more enjoyable. The game did not start till 1:10 into the movie.
3,"I didn't read the book first, but probably should have","I got the movie on sale at Amazon, so the price of the movie was less than the price of a ticket at my normal movie theater.The movie was entertaining, but somewhat slow at the beginning. It was a little predictable in places (which I cannot adequately describe without spoiling the plot). And, I guess I am going to have to read the books to figure out the meaning of the last scene in the movie. I am not big on violence in Movies, and there was more than I normally like. But all things considered, it was a good way to spend the evening with the family.Bottom line, I am glad I purchased the movie and will probably wait for the DVD and get it when the sequel comes out."
3,Absurd. Yet absurdly entertaining.,"Ok why, if the object is to be the last survivor, did people team up with Cato? Never would have happened. He didn't need them and they didn't need him. The second he went up the tree after Katniss they would have stabbed him and ran off. There is so much more deviation from human nature in this story that it absurd. The only reason that stuff was in the book and film is attract a teen audience. It turned me off. (I mean the only social group that would team up in a battle to the death is the ""In Crowd"" at a mall or High School. Just... just... lmao)Despite all of that this movie is entertaining and held my attention. 3.5 stars recommended. - MR"
1,Standard Japanese Ripoff,"Hunger Games. I liked it the first time around when it was called Battle Royale. It amazes me how people think this film is such a unique and cool movie when all the producers did is take a Japanese classic film and clean up the blood so they could release it to a mainstream audience. It is really annoying that nowhere in the film do they give credit for Battle Royale and for stealing the concept entirely. Sure they added some nice wrapper material and even got Walter White to help out but if you want to do yourself a big favor, buy the original Japanese film and you will enjoy it a lot more, I promise."
2,Hunger Games Movie a disappointment,"Although the acting is fine and the movie is well made, this movie overall is a very poor adaptation of the book. So much has been changed (and much of it needlessly) that it has lost the ""soul"" of the actualy story and turn it into a slick, glossy Hollywood-style Cliff Notes version of the original.If you never read the book, it may be fine as a popcorn movie. However, if you did read the book ,don't even bother. You will be more irritated than entertained!"
1,uhhhhhh..............,"Very bad, a pathetic movie at best. If you haven't seen it don't let your curiosity overpower your common sense."
1,Mandatory Previews?,Who's bright idea was it to make you watch the previews everything you insert or restart the blu-ray disk. I give this rating for the blu-ray only not the movie since it makes it unwatchable for me. I returned it to Amazon. Hopefully another version will come out that doesn't have this bazaar feature because from watch I heard I'd like to see the movie.
1,hunger games,for those of you that think this was a good movie SHAME ON YOU. This movie was not anything worth its time I am shooting from the hip I just watched it it and not worth anytime or mnoney
2,Shaking camera effects ruin it,"Perhaps I'm too old for hackneyed ""Most Dangerous Game"" knockoffs like this, although I found the performances of the leads entertaining. Everyone's a bloodthirsty sociopath in the near future except the Everdeens & Peeta, apparently. The anti-violence message is delivered with leaden earnestness while showing us gobs of good old ultra-violence, as is so common these days. But mostly the 'you are there' shaking camera style ruined it for me. Did Cloverdale make money? Ugh! Who finds this entertaining? Who doesn't get dizzy trying to watch a lurching image for longer than a few seconds? It's one thing on America's Funniest Videos, quite another when you've paid dearly to be entertained and get nauseated for your trouble. I'll skip the sequel."
2,Book was better,"It was ok, i know most people raved about her, but idk I wanted more from it. The book was better. Maybe it's Hyatt the kind of story better told in words than pictures. I felt they lacked in portraying done of the more emotional moments. I also didn't like that they cut done kinda important details. If the choose to do all 3 books, they will have to back pedal or invent to stay true to story, unless they plan to do more cutting."
2,Bleh...,"A great teenage movie but as an adult it was very predictable. The ending so screamed sequel, but I doubt we will even bother with sequels don't care enough..."
4,good movie,i enjoyed this movie. gorier than i expected for pg13 but still pretty cool i guess. Would recommend to a friend
5,Great Deal For A Collector!,"I just received this collector's edition from Best Buy for only $29.99! The packaging is beautiful. The 4-disc collection includes the Blu-ray version of the film (disc 1), the Blu-ray version of the special features(disc 2), the dvd version of the film (disc 3), the dvd version of the special features (disc 4), digital copy & ultraviolet. The special features are ""Game Maker: Suzanne Collins And The Hunger Games Phenomenon,"" ""The World Is Watching: Making The Hunger Games,"" ""Letters From The Rose Garden,"" ""Controlling The Games,"" ""A Conversation With Gary Ross And Elvis Mitchell,"" ""Propaganda Film,"" ""Marketing Archive,"" and a Blu-ray exclusive, ""Preparing For The Games: A Director's Process."" There is also a nice acrylic keepsake displaying Katniss' pin in flames. The film looks beautiful on Blu-ray and if you have a home theatre system, you'll be impressed. This was given to me as a gift and I couldn't be happier! Enjoy!"
1,What a Letdown!!!,"After reading the three book series at the recommendation of my four grandchildren, and enjoying the books tremendously, I looked forward to the release of this DVD. What a let down!! The film was just awful! Very poor adaptation of a wonderful book!"
1,"The Hunger Games are ""from hunger!!""","There are so many more interesting premises that could serve as the core for a sci fi movie, why this? I am not usually put off by science fiction, fantasy and/or violence, but the absurdity and evil of randomly selected teens to fight to the death every year for 75 years in some futuristic totalitarian society's version of the Roman coliseum was too over the top for me."
4,I really liked it,"I am not a huge fan as many people were surprised I hadn't seen it yet. I watched it and liked it. It starts out slow then then after the middle of the movie, it gets good. It was different and I like it a lot for that other than that it was deal so I grabbed it. My kids thought it was good enough to own."
3,Good family movie,"Dont get me wrong, there is an age that is too young for this movie, because there is some killin. It is worth a watch."
5,Awesome movie,It was amazing and well done. I could see it over and over again. It was intense. I felt like I was there as a bystander.
2,The Hunger games.,I loved the book and the story it told of a futuristic society. I thought the characters were well developed and portrayed and that the dogmatic nature of apocoliptic societies was well construed. The movies seemed flat and poorly constucted. It seems hard to be a good actress when the script has been diluted and hollywooded.
2,extremely disturbing. and an excrutiatingly painful ending,"I wish I had never watched this. It is made pretty well. But this movie's representation of populous control, propaganda and general despotism is far far far too close to the current day reality to enjoy. I guess I am not surprised that none of the other reviewers that I read seem to appreciate this, however, like this movie, I find it extremely disturbing... in the same way I am extremely disturbed that the majority are so easily manipulated into thinking that our government consists of a ""two party system"" and that we only have two choices to choose from."
3,Mature content but not really made well enough for adult expectations,I thought it was a weak romance. I also didn't appreciate the end setting up for a sequel at the expense of adequately ending the first story.
2,"Two words: ""Running Man"". Where was Richard Dawson?","This storey is mediocre at best and completely derivative. It doesn't make sense, is poorly written with no continuity. Katnip bungled her way around and Peeta (Peter?) is a wimp. The whole relationship issue is contrived and not at all believeable.It is childrens entertainment.Post apocalyptic style was done much better in Mad Max. The futuristic glam was laughable.It wasn't a waste of money but it is NOT Oscar material. Far from it. In fact it really sucked the big one, and I'm a lifelong Sci Fi reader.This movie is basically Hollywood spin trying to capture the MONEY that was so rightfully earned by the Harry Potter franchise. Hollywood thinks that they can tell some sappy storey and make bucks from it. This movie sucks on so many levels......................If this movie makes any kind of Oscar buzz then the Academy is B******T!"
4,Good Movie,"I watched this movie the at the midnight premiere, I read and loved the original book about a year before the actual movie came out and I gotta say that I was somewhat dissapointed. The movie is about a girl named Katniss (duh), her sister was picked for the annual Hunger Games; a fight to the death. Katniss, isn't going to have it so she volunteers to take her place, then the movie starts. I did not enjoy the movie as much as the book, but it was enjoyable."
4,The Hunger Games,"A very good movie with a well developed plot that was faithful to the novel, although character development suffered occasionally from clumsy dialog. The acting was solid and believable. I could not think of a single actor for any character who would have been an improvement. The costuming and sets were especially suited to the story, maintaining a familiar atmosphere with a slightly exotic, futuristic flavor."
4,Almost great,I am one of those people who is always very critical of a movie once I have read the book. This attempt to bring a book to life was no different. I think they did a pretty good job but I cannot give it 5 stars. They squeezed an awful lot into the movie and that is what it felt like. I honestly cannot see how someone could follow the movie if they had not read the book. Jennifer Lawrence was very good but it is hard to top her performance in Winter's Bone.
3,Movie okay,I was disappointed in the detail of the movie. I think the cornicopia and the features of the game field could have been much better
3,The hunger games,"The movie was great, but the quality of the DVDs was atrocious. The first disc aborted several times, the replacement played through once fine, but the second time it also aborted. The manufacturer either used lousy equipment or substandard media."
3,Hunger Games fun,"Though the movie had intense action, but not Bourne Identity intense, there was fun in it too. It hinted of a Pendragon book. Everyone says READ THE BOOK, so I guess I will read the book at some point. I suppose like the Harry Potter books, The Hunger Games book has so much more detail than the movies can ever get into them. And I understand more movies are coming out. So, I will add The Hunger Games book to my Christmas wish list. I think it's important to flow with pop culture, so you can understand movie references, MAD magazine satire, and Saturday Night Live skits, and this movie definitely fits into that category."
3,A nice movie except if...,"It took me a while to watch this movie, maybe because I read the bookfirst. Big mistake! Another example of a great book and a mediocremovie. I do not understand all the fuss about it, and even howthis movie has raised the interest in archery in the USA, and probablyaround the world.Both the movie and the book have a great story behind it, and althoughit is a trilogy, it does not give you that feeling at the end.The brutality of the book is covered as best as possible in the film(I guess to make it PG13).Still, it is a good movie to watch, and since it is going to be thebeginning of a trilogy that you will hear about in the next years,you have to watch it."
2,Not too crazy about this movie,Started out really good but it was really long and I didn't like the ending at all. Had some pretty good parts. Everyone says the books are much better.
3,No ending,"A lot of intensity and action, but predictable sceens and the lack of a closing end performance made a good movie into a mediocre one"
3,Decent Movier,"This movie was more predictable than most movies that I watch --- I rented this from amazon and am really glad I rented it, instead of buying it. Hunger Games has decent acting and great photography but after awhile I found it to be a bit boring while waiting for the predictable ending. Hunger Games has received a lot of publicity, some even compare it to Harry Poter and say its better --- I disagree with these people. I am glad I rented it but I do not believe I will rent or buy any sequels."
3,Hunger Games,I was disappointed. Didn't see it at the theater because just the general plot bothered me. Children fighting and killing other children. What made the movie worse was the adult negative influence in the game. Won't be catching the follow ons.
3,Hunger Games - Not As Good As the Book,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie so much that I actually took a couple hours off of work to see it when it first opened (which I have NEVER done before). For the most part, I was disappointed in the movie itself. I suppose if I hadn't read the book, I would have a different opinion, but nevertheless I was disappointed. I ordered the DVD, however, because it helps pass the time when flying. I don't much care for Woody Harrelson and after having read the books, he did not fit my idea of what Haymitch should have looked like or acted like. Rue's death scene and Katniss' reaction was a little underplayed in the movie."
3,Tension at the beginning but boring after that,"There are a lot of good things about this film. First of all it is well cast, with both new fresh young actors Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson the leads and older, more experience actors such as Woody Harrelson in secondary positions.The story takes place in a dystopian future where one teenage boy and one teenage girl from each district are chosen annually to fight to their deaths in a competition called ""The Hunger Games"". There's tension at the beginning as the teenagers are chosen but once they start the game part of the film, it is downhill all the way. It got so boring that I actually fell asleep in this part.Basically, this film is targeted to children and, as an adult, I was completely bored. There was no doubt in my mind how it would all turn out and the violence was pretty low key.Sorry, but I can't recommend this although I am sure some adolescents would like it."
2,Unsafe at Any Age,"Although its mish-mash of various genres ultimately makes it unqualifiable, I suppose you could say The Hunger Games is primarily a slasher film for young teens, with the scary beings who jump out at you with blades being those terrifying older teens. You have to be a grown-up to know how offensive it is in using child soldiers and portraying dogs as weapons.It could also, however, be seen despite itself as an allegory for young people being forced by their societies to compete desperately for places in universities, for jobs, for housing, etc. -- in a world where there's never enough to go around. If the film had given me any sense that it was aware of its potential in this dimension, I could give it more than two stars.Otherwise, it's a film for young teens. My favorite part (I saw it in a theater) was the vocal audience participation when the girl kisses the guy. This was a Big Deal for our audience."
1,Pure Unadulterated Crapola,"The books, all three, were fantastic reads. The only thing the movie and books have in common is the name. Nothing else. The movie is pure unadulterated crapola. If I were able I would rate the movie a minus (-) ten (10) stars. It is that bad, so bad that I was unable to finish watching it. Don't waste your money on it, buy the books and read them instead."
3,Great if you read the books...,"I read all the books, my husband didn't. I enjoyed the movie, my husband didn't. I had to keep pausing to explain things to him that weren't explained very well in the movie. The book really is much better."
3,The Books are Better,"The movie was well done for what it was, but my son and grandson asked questions about what and why. As luck would have it I read the trilogy and could answer all their quesitons, they were impressed. Thank you for helping expand my families interest in reading."
4,Entertainment,"If you have read the series, you may find the film lacking in depth, etc., but you will have a better understanding of what is going on. For those who have not read the books, this is a fun, well directed and produced film that will keep your attention from start to finish."
5,Great story,"This movie is a pretty true adaptation of the book. If you read and liked the book, then you should love seeing the story come alive. If you didn't read the book, it is an action packed movie that has a fresh storyline instead of the constantly recreated Hollywood action movies."
5,Awsome,"Loved it, can not wait till the sequel. Best movie I have watched in a while. Kept my attention all the way till the end."
5,Hunter games,"great movie, my nephew was a peace keeper. blu-ray and surround sound are a great way to enjoy this movie. great price, great delivery."
1,Trash,Kids killing kids. Utterly disgusting. Their isn't enough bad words to describe how bad this movie was. It should have been labeled in the adult section. I hope parents aren't taking their kids to see this. Trash. Bad. Yuck. Gross .... Etc
1,The Hunger Games,I hate hate hate this movie. I am going to throw it away because I don't even want it in my home.
2,"Not nearly as good as I anticipated, given all the hype!","I didn't read the book(s), so I don't have that background. Apparently they're way better than the movie. But regardless, the premise of this movie/book is just awful! Kids killing kids...for sport and entertainment? Some scenes of the movie were too graphic for me and I closed my eyes. I just don't need or want to see people hurting and dying!I DID think the actors did an incredible job. But that's the only good thing I can say about it. It was too drawn out. I kept waiting for it to be over. It did end with a pretty good cliff-hanger. They at least did a good job at that, making people interested in seeing what happens next. Still, it's sad to me that this is what so many people are interested in watching/reading."
4,good film,"a good action , adventurous film for the family. I would recommend this film to be on people's watch list."
5,Hunger,Real all the books and the movie was the best. I feel the director and actors where all great in the presentation of the first book. I am glad they didn't do all of them in one. So I have more to look forward to. If I was younger I would try one of them cross bows now.
3,Book is better,"This might've gotten a better score had I not read the book first...the book was soooo much better! Too much is cut out to shorten it to movie-length. Will I watch the 2nd one? Probably, with hope that it might be more similar to the book because I think they have the ability to be so ;)"
1,DVD's Defective,"DVD keeps freezing half way through or so. I'm not the only one with this problem. Search the web for ""hunger games dvd freeze"" and you'll see others with this problem. May be a bad run of disks, or the newest copy protection causing the usual problems. If you get a bad one, return it and demand a refund."
1,rip off,"this i s a good move and amazons service is the best. but I paid extra for the digital copy of this move and now they dont give you the disk anymore. you need to downelode it from something called ultraviolet,and it wont work for me. I will not buy another Ultra-Violet productThe Hunger Games [2-Disc Blu-ray + Ultra-Violet Digital Copy]"
1,It look like Kids Movie. don't get it !!!!!!,After watching the movie it made me want to missile Drop Kick with The Hunger Games poster at walmart.battle royale is the best [japanese movie].
5,The Hunger Games Movie,Rented The Hunger Games Movie for my family to watch and we were all happy with the movie. My wife was a little disappointed that is wasn't more like the book and I was a little lost in some parts because I hadn't read the book but it was still a good movie for family night.
4,great movie,I bought as a gift for my sister. We both love the movie because we have read the books. ads
2,The Hunger Games,Not nearly as good as the book! I would tell others to read the book and forget the movie. Just my thoughts!
3,hunger games,I guess you have to be into this and read the books to really appreciate it. It had a good story line but just didnt have the punch i was looking for after talking with people who read the book. I dont recommend this movie if you havent read the book. I guess yo can say it was dull.
2,A good movie,It was a good movie. The picture quality was good yet it didnt begin to compare to the book. They left a lot of detail out but thats commen with books turned into movies. But the movie was okay.
2,No problem with the actual movie...,"I really enjoyed the Hunger Games movie itself, my issue is that the audio is off and this is the first video I've watched on this device that the audio has been off, so I know it's not an outdated adobe like the amazon techs would like for me to believe. Also, I purchased the movie to have on my tablet so I'll have something to watch even if I don't have an internet connection. I was not aware that I would have to be logged into Amazon in order to watch this movie. I have brought this to Amazon's attention twice and have gotten no response or attempt to help. I am very disappointed in Amazon."
3,My view on Hunger Games,"The movie is interesting in a pleasantly different way. The actors did an excellent job as well. I was a little disappointed in the blue ray version, as I could see no difference between it and a standard DVD. I would recommend Hunger Games to friends and family but would advise them to watch it in the less expensive DVD version."
3,Hunger Games,I read all 3 books of the Hunger Games and I expected something a little grittier. I wish the characters had been fleshed out more deeply. Perhaps a longer movie would have provided this. It just seemed so cursory compared to the book.
3,Good but predictiable,It was good filming was good .I knew what was going to happen before it did . kinda took the fun out it .I would watch it again tho when it comes on cable.
3,2.5 Stars,"Its OK.ToskaRussian - Vladmir Nabokov describes it best: ""No single word in English renders all the shades of toska. At its deepest and most painful, it is a sensation of great spiritual anguish, often without any specific cause. At less morbid levels it is a dull ache of the soul, a longing with nothing to long for, a sick pining, a vague restlessness, mental throes, yearning. In particular cases it may be the desire for somebody of something specific, nostalgia, love-sickness. At the lowest level it grades into ennui, boredom."""
3,Hunger Games,As with movie from book titles .. so much character development and plot is missing. Makes for a very limited experience of the story.That being send .. it was an entertaining movie and I would watch it again.
3,I don't get all the hubbub,"The movie is good, don't get me wrong, but I don't see why it garnered all that hype. I didn't read the book, but watching the movie, it was so predictable. If you take one part chick flick, blend it with one part sci-fi, then you get a movie that doesn't work well on either level. I found the ""making of"" disc more interesting than the movie."
2,auntttie,"Neither the story line seemed to be a mish mash of other ""world gone wrong"" or post ""end of the world"" wars and there for didn't hold your interest. It didn't have the depth or psychological impact of something like ""1984."" It seemed to use the basis of children killing children to try and draw you in and hold your attention but that was it's weakest point. The acting was the only good part."
2,Hard Rock,"Very boring, no real.. thats it, not real. We see this in so many movies. Kinda like a mix between Runningman and Narnia."
2,Books are so much better,Was a big fan of the books but the movie wasn't nearly as exciting.Buy the books rather than wasting the 2+ hours on the movie
4,HUNGER GAMES,"SUPER DVD, FOR THOSE THAT READ THE BOOK. UNFORTUNATELY, IF YOU DIDN'T READ THE BOOKS, THERE WERE TOO MANY QUESTIONABLES. PERSONALLY, I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT AND AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT ONE."
5,Love It,"I am sure many will say ""it's not as good as the book"" which is true but the movie is still very well done. The cast is excellent and the major points of the book are all captured in this film. For those that haven't read the book, I think you will enjoy this movie as well."
3,Amazon's price was reasonable for a Blu-ray Hunger Games,"I really liked the Katness actor and the story ploy was interesting. I was, however, somewhat disappointed in the movie which, possibly, was due to all the hype it got at the beginning of its release. I am not sure exactly what I expected, but would have liked Katness to be more aggressive in the hunt. Also, I thought the scene where Katness and her partner kissed could have been omitted as I didn't think the character portrayed by her would have done that while all the time her real love was taking care of her family and waiting for her to come home.The movie was worth seeing, but I wouldn't give it more than three stars."
3,Hunger Games,Story was too predictable. It did not flow smoothly. It's OK to watch at home. I'm just glad I did not spend the money to see it at the theater.
3,It's okay,"Admittedly I have never read the book, but was interested in seeing the movie anyway. It was an okay action movie with some different ideas and some fresh faces, but I didn't think it was great blockbuster. It was just an average movie."
3,Could have been so much more,Read the Hunger Games last year and for the most part really enjoyed the book. Books and Movies are different and the story sometimes cannot translate and sometimes translates even better.The movie looked like it was going to achieve the goal of relaying the spirit of the book but just fell short on most occasions. So much potential and just got dropped.
2,problem with streaming,Had a problem with watching this movie. Stopped a number of times and was quite frustrated. The movie was good but the streaming drove us crazy.
3,I expected a bit more.,Quite a cheesy movie. If yu like love stories it might be good otherwise it's so-so. I expected a lot more. Actualy I am not sure what genre this movie belongs to.
4,hunger,I remember hearing all hype when the movie came out but I never went and seen it but after reading the books. I knew. I had to see the movie and was impressed as to how close it followed the book.
5,amazing,This movie is amazing I think it was really good I got it the minute it came out and everybody wanted one I don't understand how people don't like this movie but I respect that they don't like it it think the movie improved your view of the book cant wait for catching fire! I LOVE THE HUNGER GAMES BIGGEST FAN! !!!!!! I think it was the best movie I have ever seen Omg this movie and book are amazing !!!!!!!!!!!
4,Blu Ray Review,The Movie arrived on time and was in great condition. The movie itself was pretty good. The editing was timed to limit the violence.
5,Big Hit with the granddaughter.,"My granddaughter was all about Hunger Games for Christmas, pillow case cover, blanket, video,etc.She loves the movie, & Amazon.com.Thank You, Happy New Year!!!!!!"
4,It was good,Media overrated it. I don't know what the hype and controversy was all about. It wasn't that great. Just good.
5,Movie of Hope,"I was unsure about this series when I read the books. I couldn't imagine what the movie would be like. They seemed to be targeting a younger audience than I thought would be appropriate. I feel that they amazing with the movie. Althought it is a very serious subject, they downgraded the violence some for the movie. The movie gives a message of hope. In a place where the governement controls everything and tears everything away from so many people, this young girl, Katniss, refuses to give in. She brings hope to bad circumstances and goes on to change things for everyone. It is a reflection of so much past and present in this world. Great movie. I love watching a movie with ""HOPE"" as the dominant factor."
2,Disappointment if you have read the book,This review is about the movie itself. I was very satisfied with the quality of the video and my entire experience with Amazon video.If you have read the book you will be disappointed. If you haven't read the book I'm not sure you will be able to follow the story or understand why the characters behave the way they do.
5,Great buy,"I bought this for my daughter early so we could get it the day of release.She loves it, and loves the extras it comes with."
5,As good as the book,Really enjoyed the movie it really did live up to the book can't wait to have the entire series in my video collection
3,"The Book Was Better Of Course, but It's Still Good....","Naturally, as in all movies based on books, points were changed. I was kinda upset that they changed main details such as who gave Katniss the Mockinjay pin and of course the mutts. With the books one would want to scream because you get trapped in the world of horrors, but with the movie I was like ""Okay, whatever...."" Disappointed I paid full price instead of renting, but that's my own fault. Still a decent movie though! If the changing of book details bothers you I wouldn't buy this movie, I would rent it. :)"
4,A heroine that broods... for a cause!,"""The Hunger Games"" is what summer blockbusters are all about. It's endearing, drenched with strong characers, and it's not Twilight. Check out my in-depth reviews on:[...]"
2,Running Man,"The Hunger Games takes place in the next 10 years. A race of human clown people take over the world. The regular people must pay for their resistance with 'tribute' 20 year olds from each of the world's 10 districts. The tributes are sent by chochoo train, and trained over a week, becoming ninja killers. Over the next week the ninjas are realeased into a 12 ring circus to duel and dance and sing for the audience like American idol until one is declared a winner. The two best fall in love and go home, winners of the world!"
3,Yet another remake.,"I liked this movie better when it was called Battle Royal. From the plot, to the twists and turns, this movie is identical in every way to the film Battle Royal. It's an interesting concept, but it has been done over and over."
2,Not quite sure what all the craze is about,"I'm not quite sure how this movie got so many stars, it seems a bit like a ""B"" level movie to me. I watched it with my wife and mom and all three of us were kind of like ""meh"". I would actually give it 2.5 stars. Wouldn't watch again, and won't be watching the sequel."
2,I wasted my rental credit,"A futuristic, orderly, but sick society.THX-1138, Rollerball, and about 50 episodes of the Twilight Zone did it better. Far better. Part of it was the cast. I didn't like any of them except maybe the girl, and just when I realized this, Woody Harrelson walks in. But I pressed on, for about 5 more minutes. I probably would have liked Donald Sutherland, but I turned it off before he had said much of anything.I think if Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves had a child, that child could not grow up to be as bad at acting as the lady in pink.Not the best review, but I've watched a lot of movies lately and this is the only one I turned off.Update: I decided to watch the rest the next day while cleaning up my computers' file system. It was less unbearable because my expectations were so low and I was only half watching. I don't see how anyone who's seenRollerball (1975),THX 1138, orSoylent Greencould think this movie was good."
2,The Hunger Games,"This movie is a dystopian view of our world in which teenagers are served up as a kind of ""Roman Coliseum"" story in which they fight to the death for their individual districts with the game being rigged to boot. This movie is not entertaining, not pleasant, and basically a waste of two hours as far as I was concerned. If you are a teenager you may like it because it involves youth getting thrown to the wolves but as an adult, I just did not get it. If you must watch this, get it on demand through your cable provider and watch it once."
5,Attention grabber!,I was hooked right away! It was one of those hard to put down books. So much excitement and suspense all of the time. I am really glad I read the series.
4,Hunger Games satisfies your appetite,"The Hunger Games takes an intriguing concept ""What if teenagers were forced to fight each other to the death?"" and weaves an interesting, complex story based mostly on the book of the same name (which I haven't read). I was a little surprised how long it took to get to the game portion of the film, but it was time well spend. After the games began, the tension ratcheted up several notches.The only thing I didn't care for were the conveniently-placed voice-overs that changed the rules of the game at just the right/wrong time. I would have thought the director could have done better, but then again, the director is Gary Ross, who's one of the best, so I'm assuming he did the best he could.I recommend The Hunger Games, although it's not for the faint-of-heart."
5,Hunger games,Great movie. Upgrading my movie collection to Blu-ray. Big differance from dvd. Picture quality as well as sound as amazing
3,hunger games,"Good movie, some good action, like the dogs towards the end. the ending was bad. hopefully the next one is better"
4,Hunger Games,Liked the movie but was let down by the ending. Have seen better endings with movies that are to become a series.
5,Excellent Interpretation of Book,"Characters matched book well. Story seemed plausible, nothing too over the top. Some friends couldn't watch it; couldn't deal with theme of kids being forced to kill kids. Movie couldn't bring in all characters and details, but did wonderful job with main ideas."
3,Hungry Games,"Hungry games is the ultimate reality show for the video game generation. Full immersion technology, or telepresence, was inevitable from the beginning of entertainment. The negative side is that it appeals to Roman gladiator blood sport mentality filtered through todays twisted standards: showing a female breast would have given this movie an R-rating but cutting one off would be rated PG-13. The movie industry needs to change our culture."
4,xbox stream,the movie was pretty good and well worth the rental. i was very pleased with the quality of the stream to the xbox 360. I certainly rent again.
4,"Fantastic film, but may be confusing if you didn't read the book","As a fan of the books, I have to say that this is one of the better movies I've seen in a while. The way the actors portray their desperation, anger, fear, and love is vivid and well done. However, this is assuming you read the book, because otherwise you will miss out on some of the best parts of the film that are not explained entirely. That having been said, these are only a few scenes out of the entire movie, and are not critical to understand the plot of the entire movie. Overall, this is a fantastic film, and I recommend it to everyone, whether or not you read the book."
4,Great movie,Blu-ray is excellent. Great action and story with an interesting part played by Woody Harrelson. Buy this DVD package now
4,Extremely Entertaining - Can't Wait for Part2,"Unlike many, I had never heard of The Hunger Games until it was being advertised. There's always danger in book-to-film adaptions, but for me, simply but this was a entertaining flick. Somewhat teenie-bop, but (of course) the subject matter wast pretty serious and the effects visually stimulating enough to keep my attention. Looking forward to seeing part two/three in the coming years."
4,good movie,Overall it was a good movie although my 16 year old son thought it was an awesome movie. I would watch hunger games again but I would not pay to do it.
4,ending of movie,it started to get boring near the end of the movie -but left it open for sequel which was expected
5,Hunger Games District 12 Steelbook,"First off, after reading all three books, and viewing the film numerous times on blu ray, I decided to ""upgrade"" to the steel book. There is no additional material within the case. You are essentially buying the case. This is pretty much the way it is with steel book purchases. It's a neat collection piece."
4,the hunger games,"I had just finished reading the book when I purchased the movie. I think its hard for a movie to compete because of time limits, but the producers, directors and actors of the film did an excellent job telling this incredible, compelling story. I defintely see a sequel."
4,Much better than I thought it would be.,"Didn't really know what to expect. Had heard several different things which made me a bit leary. Very different from what I had been lead to believe it would be like. Good action, good story line and an ending I could live with comfortably. Worth the time to watch. Looking forward to more such movies."
4,Good Movie,It is good movie with different theme. Screen play and cinematography was amazing i liked the movie.I can recommend it.
3,Read the book,Had I not read the book first I might have enjoyed the movie a bit more. Except for the protagonist character development was sadly deficient.
4,Pretty good,"Being a fan of this trilogy, I couldn't pass up the movie! Movies based on books always make me nervous because my expectations are so high. I think this movie followed the story well enough. My husband became interested in the series after watching the movie, proving that you didn't have to love or even know the story to enjoy the cinematic experience."
3,hunger games,"I was disappointed by the movie. I felt that it left a lot out that was in the book version. Perhaps if I had not previously read the book, l would have enjoyed the movie more."
4,The Hunger Games,"Loved the movie not as much as the book but then I don't believe movies ever do justice to books, also the movie ended after what was in the book the first book.. no closer .. for this reason I give this movie 4 stars out of 5"
4,Good Movie,"I was not expecting a lot from this film, but decided to give it a try. Someone I work with told me it was good. I was pleasantly surprised! It is a ""teen"" movie, but was entertaining. It is, of course, a modern retelling of the Minotaur story from Greek myth."
5,Awesome!`,Great movie. Might have been a little confusing if you hadn't read the book...or at least you would have been missing important parts of the story. Well done though.
3,Unimpressed,"I enjoyed the books, but somehow the movie didn't cut it for me. Maybe it's that it is such a gruesome story that anything that lightens and brightens it seems unrealistic. The movie just had a little bit of wizard of Oz to it."
3,Hunger Games on demand video,"After having read the book I was disappointed with the movie. Too many unexplained events and it was disjointed in jumping from scene to scene. The video streamed well, as usual. Amazon Video on Demand is my first choice when renting a movie."
3,Dark movie concept,"This movie was highly rated and I wanted to see it.It is an unsettling concept. The movie had plenty of action and a decent plot. Movie can be considered disturbing and may not be enjoyed by everyone.The actors and actresses did an excellent job playing the roles.I would not watch it again, but it does make you think about things."
2,"been there, done that","This film certainly breaks no new ground. You feel like you've seen it all before - not much originality here.The acting is so-so, especially between the two principles. I never really felt like there was any real chemistry."
3,"Good scifi action, something missing.","The book is supposed to be excellent, the movie was good for a night when homeland or Dexter is not on, but it was only good, not great. Happy that I've seen it, but won't watch it again."
3,Just an average adaptation,"Was worth the rental, but beyond that, not so much. It's mildly entertaining, a few good scenes (Rue's death was handled quite well and emotionally), but overall, just ok. Book adaptations usually fall short due to time constraints and such is the case here. Check out the Honest Trailer online. Pulls in everything from the book that was missing in the movie."
3,OK for video,"Glad I didn't pay full fare at the theater. This just looked sappy compared to Battle Royale, a Japanese movie that is much darker but in better touch with reality when people are placed in such extreme circumstances."
2,children killing other children,"Children battle other children, to save their family, by earning food....horrible, tragic scenes as the children play out the ""game"" of survival..."
3,somewhat disappointed,"Unfortunately, I read the books before I bought the movie. The movie skips over a lot of background that I feel was important in building the story. If I had not read the books I would have enjoyed the movie more."
3,Well....The book was better,"This movie was OKAY at best.....But it just didn't cut it for me, not like the book did...First of all i don't think the acting was that good, none of them convinced me with their roles, sounded a bit cheesy to be honest,. Secondly, they have taken/modifed alot of things out of the book. Why is the girl that got taken and mutilated completely missing? How is Katnis infinitly hydrated in the film? When it's evident and realistic that she was craving for water everyday. Katnis and Rue weren't convincing me at all in the movie..They got like, what? 1 minute screen time max? When Rue died in the book my heart nearly sank, but when she dies in this movie it's not convincing or emotional because it seemed like they only just met each other. I don't remember them even talking about each others personal life or the birds. Overall this was a letdown."
3,Blu-Ray experience better than the theater,"For me, watching the blu-ray disc was better than watching it at the theater. The shaky camera work is much more tolerable at home (I did not get a headache) than the theater. I hate the technique. Also at the theater the sound level was so high that it was painful, which is why I rarely go to movies.Enough has been said regarding the content so I won't repeat except to say I hope there is a director's cut that more completely tells the story. I would have like to see the hovercraft pick up the dead tributes bodies. It would have shown the significance of Katniss covering Rue's body with flowers.Wes Bentley's Seneca Crane was outstanding and his beard outplays any tat ever shown on screen.On the down side is the studio holding the viewer hostage by insisting it watch ""Mandatory Previews""; knock off one star."
3,NO DTS-HD 7.1 SURROUND SOUND FOR BLUE RAY VERSION,this blue ray version is ONLY 5.1 DOLBY DIGITAL! All the reviews had this as 7.1 dts-hd sound..this is a cheap way of lionsgate films to do the audio..dont buy this version if you are expecting hi-def surround sound..no doubt this will be re-released in higher quality audio in some sort of special edition later down the road..shame on you lionsgate.
4,Nice received quickly,"Would be nice to get this product like most DVD's sold today as a combo pack which has the DVD, Blu-Ray, and digital copy as one. This has nothing to do with the seller or this purchase as they have no control over the combo package but more for the publishing house that makes these combo packs."
3,"Eh, didn't live up to the hype so many people gave it.",Not a bad movie. Interesting pretense. Pretty predictable. Having grown up in the country (Appalachia) I could relate to much of it and really identified with the area it was filmed. I spent much of my childhood running around in parts to the north. I'm sure the part 2 and 3 will focus more on the love story... whatever. Probably worth the $5 for the rental.
5,The Hunger Games,Awesome movie!!! I highly recommend it!! I saw the movie in the theater and I've got the DVD. Jennifer Lawrence kicks ASS!!
1,I was unable to remove the purchase my grandchild made by mistake,"This purchase was made much to easy for anyone with simple access to a computer. Unfortunately, my 5 year old granddaughter pressed one to many keys, and so I am stuck with a purchase that never will be seen."
1,Typical Movie for today's generation,"This movie was a huge flop. I've been hearing so many people referencing this book, so I decided to see it. I've not read the books, and from what I've seen from the movie, I don't plan on reading them.This movie was very slow in building up any story, and the so called upper class looked like someone threw-up skittles all over them. If you want a really good review on this film, see ""how it should have ended"", ""hunger games"" and its extra clip. It'll give you more reasons why I hated this film. Don't buy it."
1,The Hunger Games,"This was a stupid movie. There are smart movies and stupid movies, and this one was stupid. Jennifer Lawrence's acting was good, but the story and script were not very interesting. I felt like there was alot of mind control in this movie."
1,Disturbing.,Found the whole premise of the movie really disturbing. Children being sacrificed for the amusement of the elite was not something that made any sense to me. I don't see how this qualifies as a great movie.
1,Hunger games,"Hunger games. Boring, predictable, formulaic, pretentious. I now understand that it was a teen novel, but even considering that it was relentlessly dull."
4,Solid movie but ending left me wanting more closure,Solid movie but ending left me wanting more closure. Leaves it open. Loved the three-fingered solidarity salute. Found some of the costumes atrocious. Definitely worth renting. Could see this as some foreshadow of the future.
3,"So sick of hearing ""the books are better""","What do you get when you combine ""The Running Man"", ""Lord of the Flies"", and ""Little Women""?? You get this! Not terrible just a bit all over the place. The shakey-cam handheld B.S. (SO overdone lately) was very distracting to me. I should not feel so ""aware"" of the camera, it takes you out of the movie. It doesn't ""add tension"" so much at it adds motion sickness. On the plus side, the audio and video quality were both excellent as were the costumes. Fun movie but, unless you are a die hard fan of the story, probably more of a rental than a purchase."
2,Whats with the hype?,"I watched this on a free preview of EPIX, Im glad i didnt buy it, But then again i never wouldve bought it to begin with. I really only watched it because i liked Jennifer Lawrence in Winter's Bone and X-Men: First Class the film contains Horrible special effects(watch when Jennifer and Josh are lead on the platform with the audience cheering about 30 minutes in), RIDICULOUS hairstyles, i mean really, Did Stanley Tucci have to have blue hair? And what about Elizabeth Banks? Stupid. When the ""tributes"" are trying to attack Jennifer while shes in the tree, why weren't they worried about killing each other instead of her? Several other dumb moments like that. Woody Harrellson and Donald Sutherland are in this but they basically have bit roles and don't really add anything. All in all this was 2 and a half hours of my life i wished i couldve spent better. Pretty boring, not worthy of the hype at all."
2,Disturbing,"I watched this video because my wife read the book. I had not read the book. The movie was technically wonderful. The acting was quite good and the special effects were stunning. However, I was very disturbed by the premise that teenagers, raised in, generally, good families would kill each other with so much enthusiasm and with no apparent remorse. This feeling stayed with me for days. I am rather older than the average person to whom the books are targeted but this was my emotional reaction to the film. If I had children still at home I think that I would not recommend that they read the book or see the movie. Perhaps this was supposed to allegoric, like ""Lord of the Flies"" but it still hit me in a way that ""Lord of the Flies"" did not. I'm sorry if this is a negative review but that is my honest feeling about it."
2,Does not do the book justice,"There was so much hype over this movie, that I went out and bought the books so that I would know what the fuss was all about. I loved the books. Have actually read them a few times now, so when the movie was release I rented it right away, excited to see the book brought to life. I don't know that I've ever been more disappointed in a movie. It just didn't do it justice and in some instances blatantly changed important facts from the book. Facts that run through all 3 books. Just did not like this movie. At all."
3,"A Loyal, But Shallow, Interpretation","Surprisingly grim, gray and bleak considering the target audience, this is as close to dystopian as PG-13 gets. An inordinate amount of time is invested in world building and scene setting here, which makes for some great, functional locales, but also relegates the plot to secondary status. Jennifer Lawrence is well-cast as the brooding, bow-weilding introvert Katniss, but the rest of the cast underperforms - especially Woody Harrelson, in a role he was seemingly perfect for, as her pathetic, booze-drenched advisor Haymitch. Readers with a fresh memory of the novels will get the most out of this interpretation, which assumes its audience knows most of the finer points of what's going on and summarily neglects any form of deeper investigation. It's gorgeous, though occasionally a bit too eccentric (some scenes in the capital look like they were ripped right out of a Final Fantasy cutscene) and non-fanatics will probably find it too narrow and fluffy."
2,Bleh,"I like the books, but the movie blew! I am sorry bought this, I would have been happier just renting once."
3,Decent,"As usual, the book was much better and it was frustrating to see unnecessary changes or omissions that would have taken 3 seconds of film to have no omitted, thus leaving no good excuse for when they did omit something. But overall, an enjoyable movie. I'll definitely watch the sequels, even though I'd prefer it remain more true to the book and I think the casting sucked."
3,Could have been better,"From what I can tell, those who have not read the book prior to seeing the movie seem to enjoy the movie most. I thought Jennifer Lawrence was great, but the actor playing Peeta seemed too small to have the strength credited to him. The movie tries to be a visual retelling of the book, which never works well as everything just feels rushed and without substance as a result."
3,Not impressed.,It was ok; don't know what all the hoopla is about. Not crazy about teens and children killing each other.
1,Disappointed.,"I had high expectations for this movie after reading the book. It took me multiple days to get through the 2 hr 23 min film and finally when finished was left disappointed. I thought for all the hype the casting could have been better and I thought the filming itself left a lot to be desired - at times reminded me of the Blair Witch Project. Also, the audio wasn't very good, i had to keep turning up my volume to the maximum. Honestly? I thought I wasted my money."
1,0_o,"After caving in to all the hype, I finally rented this movie. That's 2 1/2 hours of my life that I will never get back, and $4.99 that I could have used at Starbuck's. I haven't read the books, so this movie made no sense. Even if I had read the books, I still would have been disappointed. And where in the world was that one kid hiding his cake decorating kit? Really?!?!"
2,Where have all the good writers gone in Holiwood?,"I was expecting to see a good paced and involved movie with all of the attention this movie was receiving. Unfortunately it is shallow in character development, the wardrobe is 'Alice in Wonderland' 'est, drawing way too much attention away from the actors, and I am left with a feeling of is this all their is? Hollywood needs to higher some story tellers. In a word - Boring."
5,"loved it, followed the book pretty well.","Loved the book. The movie was a good representation, so i loved the movie too! I was impressed with the special effects, they really added to the story. The acting fit the characters."
5,Awesome Movie,"Since I saw this movie in the theater, I have continued to describe it as amazing and disturbing. It is hard to watch what the kids have to go through in this movie, but the actors, the directing and the rest of the story is amazing. I cannot wait for the rest of the trilogy to come out. Hopefully, they will be able to live up to the high expectation that was set in this movie."
4,Review,"Enjoyable movie. It stayed within the story of the book, but not entirely. If you read the book, there won't be any surprises. The action in the arena was very good."
4,Good movie,I was surprised how much I liked this movie. It had a good story and good acting.I would recommend it to just about anyone.
5,hunger games,"I did not think the movie would live up to the hype, but I was wrong. This movie was fun for everyone. from the little kids to grandma everyone enjoyed the movie and we have watched it several times. We cannot wait for the sequel. You must see this movie."
4,The Hunger Games,Read the book and of course it was much better but all things considered the movie was quite good. I have enjoyed watching it more than once.
5,The Hunger Games Movie,"I am a huge fan so im on the computer 24-7. I found out they made some changes so its not exactly true to the book...but Suzanne Collins made those changes in the script (she wrote the movie script) so I trust what she wrote. But other fans are very mad, I am too but I trust her."
