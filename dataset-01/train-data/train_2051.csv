2,Yea right!!,"This movie is for the person who would buy beach front property in Nevada. The movie starts with the world at the brink of destruction. With a little less than 3 WEEKS before the comet/asteroid his the Earth they pull of a load of miracles. First they are able to round up several people in the US to drill holes on the incoming space object. Second they pull to never before seen redesigned space shuttles, and are able to put special rovers that were going to Mars. Three, able to launch dock with a space station refuel and land on the object in space.The fact is if the government saw this coming with less thanthree week before it hit, the only thing they would be thinkingabout is tiring to save as many people in the US as possible.Great story if you have a gullible imagination, other wise it is a insult to anybody that thinks. If you want a good movie watch Deep Impact!!"
3,"Sheesh, people!","This movie is not worth the heated debate that it has been getting: it's average. Yes, it's a little thin on plot in places, yes, the characters are not exactly literary classics, yes, it's horribly predictable, and yes, I think my 89-year-old Grandma has a better grasp of science than the Michael Bay. Still, this movie isn't horrible. The special effects are spectacular, Thorton is his usual good self, and Bruce Willis really isn't bad at all (actually, I thought his reflections and prayers while on the asteroid were the best part of the movie). Affleck and Tyler's characters will no go down as the new Romeo and Juliet, but some of their scenes are cute. So, come on people, reserve the heated comments for films that deserve it. See Armageddon if you want to be entertained, but not if you want to see cinema."
3,Block of clay and plastic bones is fun for patient people,"This comes as a dry solid block, which is clay with plastic bones embedded. You scrape away the clay with plastic tools provided. This takes patience, or you can wet it and have the clay fall away. I found this fun as an adult, but perhaps slightly tedious. A partner makes it more fun. The wax provided doesn't really hold the bones together securely, so the heavy head kept drooping. Glue might work better."
5,Nice detailed model,"My 11 year old son and I had good fun with this. I nice way to explore a dinosaur fossil dig in the comfort of an air conditioned room. The model skeleton has much better detail than expected. The tools worked fine, though we did get a bigger paint brush to move the dust easier."
2,far from the Best sound quality in a portable FM transmitter,"...runs off of a 3V cr2 lithium battery (wtf?)...offers a whopping 4 stations to choose from...has a weak, rarely clear, static laden signal...because of its cute bug like features I give it a generous 2 starsI would definitely recommend looking around at other fm transmitters before buying this one. I've had it a little more then a week and I'm shopping for a different one. I could be wrong, but I don't believe Iriver had anything to do with this product."
2,It won't shut off!,"The AudioBug works just fine with my iPod 5G, with the exception of the auto-off feature. Mine will not shut off, even after disconnecting the audio source, even after letting it sit for several minutes. I've already drained 1 battery. And there's no manual way to shut it off. As a result, I need to remove the battery. Not very elegant."
3,Poor picture quality and weak flash,Very cute camera but the picture quality is not that great. The flash is very weak.
5,How to use MP3 player on it.,"1. Install drivers from CD.2. Plug the cradle into usb port (don't forget to plug it into outlet too)3. Put the camera into cradle.4. Charging LED should be on now. Press on/off button on camera. It should switch camera to USB mode.5. If u installed drivers correctly, then when u load up some file browser in My Computer folder where all drives are listed, there should appear a Removable Drive (D: for example, that's right, that's ur camera). Click on it and u are in cameras memory. There are two folders - 1 for pics and 2 for mp3s. Just copy mp3 files to that directory and u all set."
5,very cute camera.,"I purchased this camera instead of a higher quality camera because of its size and its functions. The mp3 player part of it is awesome and the size of it is very convenient. its a great camera, although the quality of the pictures arent that great. i recommend this camera for people looking to take everyday pictures, but if you're looking for quality, this camera might not satisfy you. i bought a 256 memory card with it, and it allows me to have as many things on my camera as i desire. great design very stylish.. =]"
3,good for a 2mp camera with no zoom or macro,"for a 2mp camera, it's a pretty good one. you can't zoom and you can't take do macro, but if you just want something tiny (almost credit card size) just to take everyday photos, it's great. and it does movies too, which was fun. i used it for a couple of years. unfortunately, the mp3 player part of it died after a year or so - it would just cut out. but i would have no issue with buying another casio camera in the future. it is very sturdy, never had any problems with the actual camera."
3,wrong picture for towers,On page ix of the book it is incorrectly labeled as from Canton kansas. The towers shown are from Pratt Kansas. I lived there almost all of my life two houses down from the towers. It would be nice if Pratt were properly credited. Cantons towers do not look the same.
5,C'est tellement bien écrit,"Un chef d'ouvre, très éclairant sur le quotidien et la mentalité de ce terrible moment de l'histoire de la France; la version pour kindle a quelques petits problèmes, certains prénoms sont toujours écrits en miniscules, les paragraphes ont quelques fois des interlignes, rien qui enpche de proffiter de sa lecture."
5,Excellent product,"Well made and stays square and tight. I used 8 foot long 2x4's and it still works perfect. Great for future if I need to make it smaller by just shortening the 2x4's. Compared to others offered, it's the best value for price, quality and expandability."
2,"Nice product, for something I didn't order","I ordered a ""rack log adjustable"". What arrived, was not adjustable. It gets 2 stars, because what I did get was adequate enough for storing firewood and it wasn't too big or too small."
5,Move over Stephen King and Dean Koontz!,"I just finished reading A-21 and my first impression is WOW! It is not a long book, but it grabs you and holds on till the very last period. Tim Hancock has outdone himself with this book and has a VERY promising writing career ahead!Anyone serious about Horror or Suspense novels should put this book at the top of their must-read list. Tim Hancock has found a new fan, and I am anxious to read his next book!"
2,Great Concept but...,"The illustrations in this book are wonderful, but the descriptions are not very detailed, and the book does not give references. For example, it is said that a particular pope was highly critisized, but it doesn't say by whom or what was the pope's response -- if any -- to that criticism. (Nor does it cite any documents that critisize him.) It accuses another pope of ""extensive"" nepotism, without mentioning which members of his family he gave jobs to or even how many people the author means by ""extensive"" and again no references are given. I did not find the ""rose colored glasses"" nor apologist approach that another reviewer mentioned, but the lack of references made this book of limited, and questionable, value."
2,Less Than Meets the Eye,"Frankly, I was disappointed with this book. On the plus side, the illustrations are numerous and fascinating. The book is a treasury of portraits, maps, and timelines. The text is another matter. Throughout, the author adopts the role of papal apologist far more often than the role of objective historian. For those who would like their papal history without the rose-colored glasses, I would recommend McBrien's, ""Lives of the Popes"", De Rosa's, ""Vicars of Christ"", and J.N.D. Kelly's, ""Oxford Dictionary of Popes""."
3,Qualified acclaim,I have four titles in this series. I often come across the names of popes in connection with art and history and wanted a comprehensive survey. This book provides this. It is spoilt by some unnecessary and partisan comments by the author.
3,Covers SAS but not SCSI commands,"This book on SAS is ok, but it doesn't cover the underlying SCSI commands. In comparison, the SATA book covers the new SATA stuff (FIS etc) but importantly, also has the ATA commands as a reference.With the SAS book I can't write an driver because I don't know what the SAS commands (actually SCSI) are.If you want to talk to a CD-ROM/DVD-ROM etc via ATAPI you need both SATA and SCSI because ATAPI is SCSI commands packetized over the ATA command infrastructure.I have always liked the MindSpring series but this comes up short."
1,"Disappointing item, excellent service","I was very disappointed in the condition of the book purchased. After returning the item, the seller gave me a complete refund, including postage. I could not expect a better response."
1,Thank You Ashlee,"This only contains four songs!! Thank god! This would have been a best seller if it would have contained both the video of her Saturday Night Live performance, and the audio of her Orange Bowl performance, complete with the rain of boo's! Then, the album cover could have been the pained look on her face when the boos started, and the back cover could be her dad counting the money wearing devil horns.Priceless and talentless!"
5,Masterpiece,It is a perfect gift. My daughter loved it. Tag Heuer Link is one of the most beautiful watches I have seen.
3,Music without heart!,"If you want to hear the notes Mozart wrote just over two-hundred years ago, then you wont be disappointed.If you want to feel the passion this music is capable of making you feel then skip this one.Ms. de Larrocha is simply going through the motions."
2,Hmmmm...,"I don't know if it is these particular piano sonatas or the playing, but I do not enjoy this disk. I couldn't read the little booklet that comes with the CD before purchasing, but it states ""Mozart's keyboard sonatas, now staples of the recital repertory, were not origainally intended for the concert platform. Unlike his piano concertos, whose grand formal designs and viruosic style show clearly that they were destined for public performance, the sonatas reflect a more personal context."" These sonatas are some of Mozarts earliest surviving work of this kind. Perhaps a true student of the piano would enjoy this CD."
2,too simple and too expensive,"The idea presented is ok, but too simple, it does not have any references, and book itself is too expensive, not worth the value."
2,"I got it to own it, but I never listen to it.","It looks good in your collection of you do that sort of thing (which I do). But even if Professional Widow were your absolute favorite Tori song, I wouldn't recommend buying this single. I like remixes and reworkings and all that but I still think this is pretty awful stuff. Another reviewer said they ""zoned out after the fiftieth repetition of 'It's gotta be big...'"" and that's pretty accurate. If you have Tales from a Librarian I'm fairly certain that the remix on there is from this CD. If it's not the same exact one, it's close enough to not matter. Forty minutes of that is more than even the biggest Tori lover can handle."
2,Just...blah,"I don't usually take the time to write a review for something I don't like, but I think I should add to the list of them on here so far. It is true...this single is boring and repetitive. A song that could have been made so interesting as a remix turned out as bad as these remixes are. It's basically listening to the line in the song ""It's gotta be big"" a million times backed with a house beat. I don't know about you, but that's annoying to me. It's a wonder to me this single was so big in the UK."
1,Not a good representative of Tori's capabilities with techno,"Although these remixes lack bite, which is my main criticism of them, her efforts at techno such as Blue Skies with BT, Talula, also with BT, and her techno-y songs on From the Choirgirl Hotel are really good. If I hadn't heard any of that stuff, I would probably have given this CD a much higher rating. My standards for Tori are very high, and her not fulfilling them on this CD is an exception to the rule, the rule being that TORI IS AMAZING, and so it follows that she is usually amazing with her techno stuff."
1,"Uninspired, devastatingly dull club ""music""","Tori Amos is a good singer, not that you'd know it from these remixes, which really take about one line from the song (""It's got to be big"") and repeat it over and over. It's not that the original ""Widow"" was bad, but this makes you wonder why Tori would approve of these mixes enough to allow them to go commercial."
2,not the usual Tori,"I am an avid Tori fan. I have been collecting her work for years and as of now have 20 of her CDs, many of them imports and singles. Tori's style lies in her great voice and her piano skills, and this single doesn't focus on either one of those things. She's not a dance club mix artist and I was disappointed that this album came across as such. Thankfully, the work she released after this single has been more of the Tori I love, with her voice and her piano/harpsicord capturing the audience."
3,Not the classic Tori,"When I got this, I thought it would be the song ""Professional Widow"" sung and remixed as a dance song. Not what I got. I recommend the Jackie's Strength remixes."
3,The unfortunate thing about remixes...,"...is that they sometimes have a nasty habit of taking the soul--and meaning---out of a song. I do not doubt the talent of those who mixed these tracks, but I would not recommend this to anyone who is not very familiar with Tori's music. It's not representative of her sound, generally, and doesn't really get across to the listener the wide emotional and lyrical spectrum that Tori is capable of. However, I must say that I am thrilled that she has allowed her stuff to be remixed because it introduces her to a whole new group of listeners who might not have been exposed otherwise. If you collect dance music, this is a quirky must--if you collect Tori music, this is great--but if this is your first experience with the music of Tori Amos, I might recommend one of her full-length albums (try ""From the Choirgirl Hotel"") first."
2,this CD gives Tori a bad name...,"I have to admit, I don't have much enthusiasm for Armand's work. I've heard this remix so many times on the radio and I'm disappointed that it's the only ""song"" of Tori's that many stations play. As a result, many of my friends who haven't heard much of Tori think I'm nuts for liking the ""It's gotta be big"" lady... There's nothing wrong with remixes of Tori's work, and Andy Gray (""Raspberry Swirl"") has shown how powerful they can be. But obviously the DJs who did this single don't really know what mixing is about."
5,Great single!!,"So far this is the only Tori Amos single I have. I've never really had the chance to check out any of her other stuff. Anyways, I bought it as an import in '97. Could never find it under US release at the time. All in all I'd say this is a GREAT song. It hit big in the clubs here at that time, unfortunately it's pretty rare that they play it now. The one I have has some of the same songs as the US release, but not as many. FYI, here is the track listings on the import: 1. Armand's Star Trunk Funkin' Mix-Radio Edit (3:45) 2. Mr. Roy's 7"" Edit (3:47) 3. Armand's Star Trunk Funkin Mix (8:06) 4. Mr. Roy's Cosmic Cottage Mix (7:55) 5. Just Da Funk Dub (3:31) Any other suggestions for other GREAT Tori Amos songs?"
2,"Great Song, Bad Remixes","Professional Widow is one of my favorites from her 1996 album Boys For Pele, but these remixes dont do justice to the original. Repetitive meaningless remixes that seem to go nowhere. In my opinion, this is just a song that isnt meant to be remixed. The one good track though is the LP Edit. I guess the CD is worth it if you are a Tori fan, maybe you will like it, if you dont its worth having just to collect perhaps."
3,Fits for adapter ring,"This cap fits onto my original Cokin adapter ring and covers it completely. It does not sit tight but rather spins on the ring it kind of loose. And if you put your camera in your bag the cap can easily fall off. Well, it did in my case. It does not have springs which are usually used on regular lens caps. This cap slides and snaps on the ring. You can't use it alone with filter holder. The cap won't fit in it. The cap is made of plastic about 2mm thick. It does the job, made in France."
4,Interesting and novel (so to speak!),"An example of the ""Nouveau Roman"" literary movement in France, La Modification lacks a coherent plot, but the novel does not need one, and it makes up for the absence in its other appealing elements. The narration is told in the second person formal sigular (""vous"" in French) as opposed to the usual ""il/elle"" (he/she) third person perspective or the ""je"" (I) first person choice. The author takes the reader on a train ride, describing every element of the voyage so minutely that the reader gets the desired impression that he/she is completing the train ride him/herself as the book progresses. Because the reader IS the main character, it is extrememly intesting to keep reading if only to find out more about ""yourself."" Aside from being an actual voyage, the ride is also metaphorical, and the main character travels through his memories as the train heads for Italy, the destination.I definately recommend reading this in the original French, if at all possible!"
2,Not Recommended,"In Old Saxon Blood, Matthew Stock and his wife were not complete nitwits, but suddently, in Knaves Templar they are. In OSB, Matthew is not a sexist snob, but in KT, he is. The novel is glaring in its manipulation of the characters so that the author can make a series of obvious points about the treatment of women.Not recommended."
3,for hard-core fans only,"if you want To Step Aside and Se a Vide E, just get Bilingual which, by the way, is terriffic. If you want to hear the two remixes, don't bother: these remixes are horrible. But if you are a huge fan, this one is worth having for the two decent b-sides."
1,Terk Technologies LF-DAS,"Good sound, when it works. If you have any other 2.4Ghz devices in your home, telephones, WiFi, Keyboards, etc. buy something else or live in 2.4Ghz hell. Range is limited to about 50 feet in open air, 20 feet through walls. There is no way to know what channel the device in operating on and power loss results in channel setting loss.Look for 5.8Ghz devices or save a lot of time and run the wires."
3,terk wireless audio sender,this is a pretty decent device for the price although there is not the distance factor that would give it a higher rating; this device works best with line of sight and within about 20 feet of the sending unit; it also would be better if it had an on/off switch on the unit itself instead of needing to be plug into a switched outlet; it might be good as a secondary unit when going wireless with a 7.1 system's rear and surround channels.
5,TERK LF-DAS WIRELESS DIGITAL MUSIC TRANSMITTER/RECEIVER SYSTEM,"Love it. It works great for an extra set of speakers for the TV.I placed speakers next to my 85 year old father-in-law's chair so he doesn't blast us out of the room anymore. The receiver & speakers are 15 feet across the room from the TV & transmitter. I have not tried a further distance or a different room.The RCA (red/white) cable is attached to the TV audio out & the other end of the cable is 3.5mm attached to the transmitter audio in. The receiver is attached to the speakers with a 3.5mm cable. It also comes with a USB/USB cable and a 3.5mm/3.5mm cable so you can transmit audio from any source. Both the transmitter & receiver have their own power cords. They are 2.75""W x 3.25""H.The speakers are inexpensive Logitech S120. They have 120v power cord, volume control and headphone jack."
1,Make sure they go on PVC gutters!,"We had the roofer install these on all our aluminum gutters when our Virginia 2-story(w/porch) was re-roofed.Initially, we couldn't have been more pleased with them. BUT, after a full year and exposure to the sun, 99% of these screens detached themselves from the gutters, warping into ""U's""! Obviously, they all will need to be replaced!The only explanation that makes sense is that the different expansion rate of materials (aluminum gutter - vs - plastic screen guard) causes this problem.Unless you are in a VERY shady place that doesn't get warm, use disimilar materials at your own risk!"
2,Mesh will not pass water fasty enough...,"Peel the mesh off these and they will work fine, at least until the sun warps them beyond use and it doesn't rain too hard. Heavy rain rolls right over the edge of these because they can't let enough water through fast enough. They are inexpensive though, but still won't last much more than a year or two. Given the time it takes to install, I'll go with higher grade stuff next time."
2,Do your homework!!,"***If you cannot get them under the bottom layer of shingles DO NOT BUY THESE!!***I bought a bunch of these and installed them, with some difficulty.We have an older house with multiple layers of shingles and they wouldn't go under the bottom layer. So when it rained, the water would come off the roof and hit the edge of the guards and skip over the gutter. I'll put up with cleaning my gutters periodically."
3,Hmmmm.,I almost wonder if my oil is spoiled? Was expecting a buttery warm taste with some bite..and it's off. I know the quality of what Ina prefers from her books and show and this doesn't seem up to par...
1,WARNING: INCOMPLETE BOOK!!!!!,"The book deserves a 5-star rating, it is a classic that CH Spurgeon couldn't praise highly enough. But Kessinger have only reprinted the first 223 of a 440 page original work. The title of the book's cover is what this book SHOULD contain, namely an exposition of a total of 15 psalms; it only gets you as far as 5 psalms - one third of the advertised amount.You're better off just forking out for the Sprinkle publications reprint to be sure you're getting the whole book.Mine's getting shipped back to Amazon for a refund :("
4,Safco Mesh Desk Organizer,"Ordered for my classroom. Durable, but was bent when received. Easy to bend back to orginal shape. Would buy again."
3,Larger than I expected,"This product takes up more space than I really wanted it to on my desk but it gets the job done. It is a catch all for papers, bills and other documents. It is very large, well made and heavy (in respect to desk items). I would recommend the product but know that it is pretty big and bulky."
2,Nice concept but arrived badly bent,"I saw a few negative reviews but the majority were positive, so I thought I'd take a chance. Well, the outside box was fine, but the organizer itself looked like someone had sat on it. Kind of like a square made into a parallelogram. I didn't want the hassle of returning it, so I tried to straighten it out. But the metal is quite heavy and it wasn't easy. The result is -- functional. For $10, this would've been OK. For $35+, not so much. Too bad no one makes something similar (that I could find, anyway); it's a nice concept."
4,Too heavy and quite big,"Item is exactly as the picture, but I must admit I didn't read the description so I was a bit shocked when I received the item.It is a big and bulky item, provides you with a lot of space to organize whatever you have laying around.It is made of heavy material, it's very sturdy and even though it takes up a lot of space on my desk; I really like it.I organize the payments that need to be sent out this week, next week, next month, magazines, documents, etc.. whatever you want to do with it."
5,Great item!,"Purchased the desk organizer for my daughter's desk in her apartment. She needed an organizer that was heavy enough to hold binders for grad school and would fit on a small desk. This desk organizer was perfect! It is very heavy duty and will not slip and slide around on the desk. The slots hold up to 1 1/2 inch binders perfectly. This organizer is a little ""pricey"" but like all things...you get what you pay for! This item is worth the extra money. We were very pleased with this item! Arrived in a timely manner and it was well-packaged for shipping. The organizer was in its own box and that box was placed in another shipping box that was well insulated to prevent damage. I was worried that it might arrive bent or damaged after reading previous reviews, but that was not the case. Great item for keeping items organized in a tiny space! I need to order one for my desk at school!"
5,Lots of storage in a relatively small space,"For a desktop organizer, this is very nice. It isn't small by any means...but it has LOTS of slots and they are a good size for each. I have it sitting on top of a filing cabinet, and it takes up most of that space...to give you an idea on how big it is.And it can hold A LOT. Maybe too much- but that's just because I stash and dash. :)"
2,Arrived bent and mishapen,"I had really high hopes for this product. It looked solid, and came very highly recommended. It arrived bent and distorted. I had to wedge a coaster under it to keep it upright. Why didn't I return it? Spend money to ship it back, and back out, and hassle, hassle, hassle... first negative experience on Amazon. I will think twice in the future."
3,Just a little wrong,"Two of the wire products, including this one, on my order were just a little bent so that they dont sit solid on the desk. They rock just a little which could be a big problem if I was looking at the items on my desk but they are being used in a supply area and no one will care. The ""bend"" in the metal isnt visible but its just enough bent that they dont sit right on a desk. The boxes they arrived in were not damaged so it is assumed they were sold this way."
5,"As advertised, self-adhesive rubber pads a plus","The organizer is well built and looks nice. However, make sure that you understand its dimensions because the pictures can be deceiving (it was a bit larger than I expected from looking at the pictures alone)."
2,Low Quality Garbage,The build quality of this organizer is so poor it's almost laughable. There is not a single section of this thing that is not bent; in fact I cant find a single right angle in the entire thing. There are deformaties in the construction that cannot be attributed to shipping damage. This is a poorly built piece of garbage you should avoid at all costs.
5,Great daily organizational system,"I use this to sort my daily jobs, which are enclosed in plastic sleeves and are due the same day I get them. It's been working out great; much better than the plastic horizontal trays that, frankly, cracked under the weight of the voluminous heft of the daily projects and didn't hold the oversized jobs well. The way I have the organizer oriented is so the side is facing me. The jobs stand up and can be flipped through quickly and efficiently when needed. That said, my only problem is how to label the sections. There's no way easy way to attach labels to the side of the section so that they are visible from day to day. However, this is a small issue only because of the way I am using the organizer. Overall, it is a very good product and has solved the problem of using plastic trays."
2,Better packaging is needed,"It came to my home in a smashed box, and was bent. But I will blame that on Fed EX. Because they should have never accepted the box from the shipper if it was damaged or it might have been mis handled by a Fed Ex employee along the way. This organizer is larger then I expected and takes up a lot of room on the desk. that is why this review is only two stars."
2,Okay...,"Somehow not what i expected it to be yet at the same time exactly what I expected, if that at all makes since. Reading it became very tiresome. Seemed to be just like the other teen novels out today about popularity, sex, and drugs. If you liked all the other books with that subject line then this is the book for you but other than that dont waste your time."
4,Book Review by Kara Manns,"My name is Kara Manns and here is my book review for Mr. Melia's Honors English 9 Bridge class at Cosumnes Oaks High School.The book I read was Lust by Robin Wasserman. This book was about a group of teenagers that were trying to live life the fullest. The problem was, a new girl moved into town that was really pretty. Some of the girls like Beth and Miranda got jealous. Finally she fit in with the crowd, and everyone started to like her. The fights over boys got feistier, but that's a girl for you. Living in the summer time, and then going to school with everyone can be fun, but it sometimes can be over whelming. Also, sometimes, parties that are peer pressuring can get the best of you. You might not want to go, but you go anyways and follow them. You might even end up doing something stupid like in this book. I don't want to give it all away so read this book, and the novels that follow it!"
4,Great Book,Loved it! I couldn't put it down! It definately gets hot! Just purchased the second book Envy. I recommend it...
3,Problem is that most oriole feeders attact everything but orioles,This nectar is available elsewhere but oriole feeders are the problem not the nectar. Currently I use sugar water and the bees and one local rat love the feeder. Hardly any birds use it.
2,Misleading title,"This is not a ""Conquistadores ship"" (leading to think a Castilla/spanish ship in Central America) but a ""caravela"" (the type of vessel the Portuguese used in their discoveries by sea in the XV and XVI centuries). This was the primary ship, later on they used much bigger and armed vessels, called ""nau"". Thus, this toy should be named ""Discovers caravela"" instead."
5,Good for the entire body,"I am 71 years old and regular yoga was too difficult; however this chair yoga gives you a good workout, good stretching for all parts of the body, strengthening all parts of the body, especially, the back and legs. I feel stronger, have better posture and my knee doesn't bother me anymore. It is great, and many times we find we are not even really using the chair - it is just there as a support in case we need it. Valerie gives wonderful detailed cues as to how your body's position should be in every posture. It is wonderful"
5,Excellent guide for artists at all levels...,"If you're turned on by drawn out, dense textbooks about the science of recording and producing - look elsewhere. This is a book filled with directly applicable tips and advice written by a seasoned industry professional with some serious acts to his name.This book covers a lot of ground in a little more than 100 pages. Olsen doesn't try to comprehensively cover each topic he brings up - he instead includes the most important pieces of advice gleaned from his nearly forty year career in the music industry.This is not the end-all guide to recording, but it is not often that a book with this much information on technical topics is laid out in such a straight-forward style. Olsen's colorful personality really comes through too - with stories and anecdotes that give this text a comfortable, informal feel.I hope you enjoy and learn from this book as I have..."
4,Good finale,Very satisfying conclusion to the series. I enjoyed it and the story ties up well. Not the most stunning work I've read and yet well worth reading. I found I liked all the characterizations thru out the series.
3,ripe,"In the third book of the trilogy Ms Fallon finally harvests what she seeded in the previous books: her world and characters outlined to the detail, she is now able to build a good exciting plot, with lot of action and many interesting twists. This last book is quite hard to put down.Dirk, the main character, is now interesting, lovable; Marqel and Tia, who previously seemed rather lunatic and unbelievable, finally act consistently. On the other hand Ms Fallon loses grasp of the two main villains: one dies and the other becomes pale and vague.The writing is neat, always to the point, with lot of humour and a bit of slang as if the author finally had relaxed a little. No masterpiece is to be expected but a bit of solid reading."
4,"Good, cheap battery but has less mAh than original","Like the title states the battery is good, priced to sell but is only 650mAh and that means it wont last as long as your original when it was new..."
2,surprisingly terrible!,"Well, this is just to say that I was surprised by how boring (and seemingly uninformative) this book is! The title really grabbed my attention and I love anthropology (especially cultural anthropology). However, for whatever reason, it just didn't do anything for me. In fact, it did LESS than anything for me! (there's another fifty dollars forever gone)..."
1,:(,I never received the item as promised and never heard from the seller when attempted to get in contact with them. never will buy anything from them again!
1,gooses review,"this book was boring. Evrything in here was either stuff you could look up in the dictonary and that you wouldn't need to because the terms went by other words as well, or common sense that you would know by guessing. This book reads similar to books made in the era of black and white television whos goals were to dispense facts and not to entertain thus saving space and money. Because of this it sounds just like an instruction manual except for the fact that most instruction manuals arent this long. If you plan on reading this book all the way through good luck its a 282 page instruction manual. If I could have I would have given it a negative one star review"
3,Textbook for Anthropology Classes,"I've enjoyed reading this textbook so far. However, when purchasing this for a course be sure that you have the correct edition or you will find yourself falling behind in your class."
5,worth the price,"This is my anthropology 101 textbook. We just started reading it. But i mean, everything else is worth paying 4."
5,"A great read for non-golfing moms, too!","I'm a mother of a son, not a father, and I don't golf, but I loved this book! As a parent, it was a great story to read, and offered some wonderful life lessons. Andrew Shanley is a talented writer who truly opens his heart and soul to readers, making this a book with true universal appeal."
3,AVERAGE BUT ENTERTAINING,Don't expect a classic or even a very good movie and you'll probably be entertained by this no-budget horror / thriller. The lead actors are all good (two of the actresses are VERY hot) and there are no really awful links in the cast. The story is all been-there-done-that but it's a decent generic horror / thriller tale that is unpredictable at times and has some decent bloody (no FX) kill scenes. The finale is satisfyingly suspenseful and ends well. Not a great movie but it should temporarily stave off your basic horror cravings.
5,THE BEST Po5 EPISODE EVER!,"This episode was, by far, one of the best episodes that they have ever done! Starting out with a family dinner was a good way to lure Bailey, but not the best. The best way to lure Bailey to their house was to get him there by using who he loves most: Owen. I thought the scenes with Lacey were absolutely wonderful. You could really feel her pain as she's talking to him on the phone. Then when he got there, they wanted him to go to rehab. Good acting on Scott's part. But I would have to say my all-time favorite scene in that episode was when Scott lost it with everyone and started attacking them, revealing information about their past. I had only started watching ""Party of Five"" during the third season, but I have been a faithful viewer...from then to when it was cancelled, and I am sorry it was. Loyal ""Party of Five"" fans will miss it."
3,A great episode,"In my opinion this was one of the most powerful episodes, but I don't know why you would spend 10 dollars buying it. Re-runs are on lifetime all the time and you might as well tape it for FREE and it would be better quality."
5,Very Entertaining!,"Have loved Wallace & Gromit for years! Great fun, clever dialogue, superb animation - kids and adults will likely enjoy this."
2,terrible sound quality,"The documentary seemed to be well done, but the sound quality was so bad, it was hard to understand alot of what was being said. The images could have been alot sharper as well. I'm sure I would have enjoyed watching it, had it not been such a poor print."
3,the legend of mm,"movie was interesting. i wasnt really impressed with the actress michelle but i am not a huge marilyn fan, just wanted to see what all the talk was about. very sad that she led such an emotionally tortured life"
4,"Reliable, but hard to read","I agree with everything about the quality...my issue with the watch is that it can be hard to see what time it is because there's little contrast between the hands and the face. Given that this is pretty important for a watch, I'm going to try a mother of pearl face to see if it's easier to read."
5,Negro Spirituals,"LOVE this CD set. Hate the fact that it had to come from France because it's not sold in the US. That aside, the music is inspiring and moving."
5,Excellent recording!,"This is an excellent recording of my favorite Broadway show (and that's saying a lot!!). I have this version on CD and the Original Broadway Cast on DVD, and it's a toss which is better. I actually prefer the Witch on this recording to Bernadette Peters (sacrilege, I know!), and Little Red on this version is far superior. (The OBC Red is shrill and not very good at all.) No one can compare to Joanne Gleason as the Baker's Wife, which is why she won a Tony for it, but this one is excellent as well. The only thing that's a little strange on here is that sometimes the cast has an American accent and sometimes British. Hmm...You can't go wrong with either of these recordings. Highly recommended!"
2,"Rhythm, people, rhythm","Wow, just listened to this and was HIGHLY disappointed. Most of the tempos are too slow, which makes the songs drag, and there's some seriously odd choices made in casting people who can't sing very well (I'm looking at you, Narrator).The British accents are fine, (aside from Rapunzel's prince, who seems to be Italian) I don't think they really make the show work ""better"", though. The cast seems to be taking it all much too seriously- there are dark moments, yes, but it is a comedy.Certainly it's instructive to listen to it back-to-back with the OBC, if only to see how different 2 recordings of the same show can be."
2,Whoa Man!,"Okay so Into The Woods is one of my favorite musicals, and so I thought it would be interesting to hear it in a different cultural... Let me tell you was I surprised! I LOVE everything British, I'll admit to being an American who would like nothing more then to move to London and never look back, but this was horried. The British Accents just dont work for these characters, and how heavy they are throughout the songs is distracting at the least. Definately buy the Original Broadway Cast!"
3,Into The Woods - Original London Cast,"I find it difficult to understand why some people (mainly from the US I think) consider this recording superior to the original Broadway cast. There is one extra number, cut from the original production, which doesn't really add much. The band on the London recording is a bit louder. Imelda Staunton doesn't have the wonderful ""built-in"" irony to her voice that Joanna Gleason does. But for me the worst aspect is (sadly) Julia MacKenzie - the top of the voice wobbles like mad, and she becomes rather operatic when not using her chest voice. Bernadette Peters is much easier on the ear, and much funnier. Also Nicholas Parsons is a bit of a bore as the Narrator - thankfully he doesn't double as ""Mysterious Man""."
4,Not as good as Broadway but worth it for Our Little World,"Somehow, most of the tracks on the London version don't do it for me as much as the Broadway. Maybe it's the loss of Peters and the others; maybe it's because of some of the odd speeds and inflections in some of the songs. But I will say this for it: It's worth it if only for Our Little World, which is an amazing song between Rapunzel and the Witch."
5,One of the best recordings of the best musical composer,"This is one of the best recordings of a Sondheim musical. And if you think, as I do, than Sondheim is the best living musical composer (and one of the bests in the history of musicals), you can imagine the result.This is a must. You have to have it. Once you've got it, you won't understand how you can have lived without.Touching, brilliant, strong,... excellent!!"
4,It's a movie I like to watch every Christmas.,"I no longer get Hallmark station so decided to order it. I would recommend it for family viewing, although I am single"
5,A sweet Christmas story!,"This is such a sweet, touching story that we love to watch at Christmas time or any time during the year. It is a movie worth watching more than once."
5,awesome,this is really good movie if you like love stories this real good one come check to out hope you like
5,A Hallmark Special,"As an avid Christmas movie-aholic I found this one made me feel good. A woman runs off with her prison-bound sister's kids and ends up in the town of Bethleham (in the USA). With no money and a broken down car they take up residence in a long empty house that is awaiting the deceased owner's heir. Emilie is mistaken as the heir and doesn't correct the townpeoples assumption. The ""Miracle"" is when the children find a normal life and find out that ""anything is possible"". If you like feel good movies and putting the tissue box to use, get this one."
5,great,"this movie is great it showes what areal family would do for little family members ,fantistic,,,, love this movie ican watch it over and over"
5,A single with some very nice b-side treats.,"The original version of the title track can be found on Amos's second solo release, ""Under the Pink."" The version here is the one used for the promotional video clip for the song. It is shortened dramatically, with a significant amount of content taken out. The reason for this is quite simple: the original is simply too long for radio and video play. Regardless, it worked: ""Cornflake Girl"" remains one of Amos's biggest hits to date. The b-sides on this single include the cute, but not ground-breaking, ""Daisy Dead Petals,"" and some of Tori's best b-side work: the Amos fan favorite ""Honey"" and the haunting ""Sister Janet."""
5,Best Single I have by her so far.......,"What can we all say? Tori is amazing! She is the best just by her emotion in her music alone. This is by FAR her best cd single yet (and I have quite a few). Now ""Cornflake Girl"" was not her BEST song on ""Under the Pink"" but ""Sister Janet"" and ""Daisy Dead Petals"" just make this single SOOOOOO worth owning. I am partial to ""Sister Janet"" because it was one of my wedding songs, it is beautifully composed. I am also partial to ""Daisy Dead Petals"" because it was the first b-side that I heard by Tori and it is a PERFECT example of Tori's love for the use of food metaphors. Only a TRUE lover of Tori's music can appreciate that song. If you have a connection with tori and her music then you will connect with this song. I just LOVE this Cd and HIGHLY recommend EVERY Tori lover own it!!"
1,Didn't work from the get go,"I took a chance on this expensive heating pad and lost. I plugged it in and the digital readout says F2. Whatever does that mean? Just like other reviewers, I got a defective one. Seems like a nice design if it would only work."
1,Defective design,"After about 2 months of use, I started having problems with it shutting itself off and showing an F1 on the display. It would not reset itself until I unplugged it for a few minutes. In July, I called the warranty department and was shipped a new one. This one worked for about a month before the pad started shutting itself off and showing a code of F2. At this point, I have asked for a different model as a replacement. Sunbeam has been very cooperative."
1,Craptastic,Returned right after I tried it... does not get hot AT ALL.Very disappointed since it is so expensive.
2,Too hot on lowest setting !!!,"I purchased this at CVS before I read the reviews- dumb move on my part. It works right now (one week old)BUT I already have a problem. In trying to treat my torn rotator cuff, I find that the LOWEST setting is so hot that I can't stand to have it on me for more than 2-3 minutes. This requires that I constantly turn it on / off to manage the heat. I have read MANY reviews that complain about not having enough heat making this pad virtually useless but I am finding the opposite problem.Bottomline, I have other SUNBEAM products (different heating pad and an electric blanket) and I am not satisfied with ANY OF THEM. If it is SUNBEAM anything, forget about it. Just keep going straight past SUNBEAM to the their competitor."
1,Disappointing,I was happy with this item for 2 months and then it just stopped working. Construction is of quality but what good is that if can't use. It isn't a low priced item and I expected more out of it. I am very disappointed in this Sunbeam product.
5,Best heating pad ever,"This heating pad is terrific because it has so many heat levels that you can find the perfect one for your needs. So often, there are just 3 levels and none is right. Too hot is even dangerous. This heating pad has many levels and you can always find the most comfortable one. It also has velcro pads that help you wrap it around a knee or elbow so that the heat gets right into the joint."
1,F2!,"Worked for a few weeks, now ""F2"" error displayed on screen. I actually wanted an old-fashioned hot water bottle, but apparently no one sells them anymore, just these cheap electric devices that end up in landfills after a few uses. Sorry, Earth!"
1,F2 error code,"A HUGE disappointment, especially for the money I spent. It never stayed on 8 hours, maybe 30-60 minutes. When I awake in pain, I have to turn it on again. Biggiest problem is the recurrent F2 error code. First time I unplugged the unit and let it reset. Now it happened again and nothing will fix the problem. The unit is dead. Also, one of the prongs that attaches the electric cord to the unit has snapped off. Besides all of that, the electric cord connector is right next to the heating pad, very bulky and hard, and always digs into some body part. I would NEVER purchase this unit again and will probably avoid Sunbeam altogether."
3,Good heat,"While it worked, it worked well. It lasted only about 2 years. I discovered that this item commonly lasts 2 years , or less."
1,"Nice feel, good control, does everything well but provide heat.","It has a good solid well-built feel, and with eight heat settings and controllable auto-off times, what more could you want? Well, you might want heat. At the highest setting, it's just barely lukewarm. But today, during a power failure, with the house on generator power, I turned it on and at the lowest setting, it almost gave me serious burns. Definitely the electronics need some improvement."
1,Weak,I bought it and took it right back. If it only had more Heat. I was disapointed in the High Heat setting. It did not get too warm. I suppose it is good for Old women.. I needed something with more Heat.
2,"Not hot enough, controller gets hot","At the highest setting, the warmest my skin gets is 105F. That's not warm enough to do any good. The controller gets almost as hot at 100F. I have an old heating heating pad that reaches 110F on the middle setting, which is warm enough to do some good."
3,good story line; dreadful editing,"Painfully poor editing detracted from what should have been a four star read. example: ""a grizzly sight."" which should be ""a grisly sight."" No commas, ongoing sentences, poor punctuation, and in general, sloppy editing. Incorrect context in main descriptions, not in dialogue where it would be possible. Use of ""Julia"" as heroine rather than ""Jessie."" ""Julia"" was heroine of prior book. If Ms. Anders has an editor, get another one, immediately. If she does not have an editor, get one, immediately."
1,poor excuse for a book,"I can't believe first of all that anyone would think this book was scary, much less Anne Rule. Did she even read it? It was lame in every way. The plot was stupid and amateurish. The way it was written was absolutely horrid and I wonder how it even got published. Donna Anders writes like she is a child. She has the child in the book speaking like an adult and the adults all speak as though it is a b movie and they have nothing to work with. The plot, which is so silly I had to laugh, does not even make any logical sense in the end. I will not comment more on it in fear of giving it away in case someone actually makes the mistake of reading this sad excuse of a book as I did."
5,Excellent for graphics beginner,"I grasp computer concepts very quickly and have worked with some desktop publishing programs, but had never worked with a ""professional"" graphics program before. This book, however, was excellent; within an hour I was up and running and very comfortable using both the program and the book. Would recommend highly. Now I wish the author would write one for Corel PhotoPaint (hint, hint)."
1,"Doesn't work, Poor customer service","I received the card reader as a freebie with my order. I doesn't work. After I plug it in and insert a memory card the computer says no ""disk is inserted,insert disk to continue."" I have emailed Blue Proton three times with no response. I have also gone through Amazon.com to contact Blue Proton, again with no response. Poor Customer Service!"
4,"Cheaply made, but does the job.","This is a very cheaply constructed card reader. However, I have had no problems using it.It has worked well. Be careful about how/where you store it. It feels as though the slightest hit would smash it into oblivion."
4,Great Product,"I have been using this reader/writer for several months, and it works perfectly with my SDHC memory.I have it connected to a USB 2 interface and the file transfers are very fast. The speed limitation is due to the class of memory, and I can see a big difference between my class 4 and class 6 memory sticks.You can spend a lot more money on a reader/writer, but none will work any better."
5,Great little gadget,"I have owned other SD card readers, but this one has worked the best and easiest for me."
1,Don't Buy look elsewhere.,"I bought this card reader for the price, because it was inexpensive. That was a fortunate mistake it last for just over a week. The end caps dont stay on and it feels very cheaply made. I bumped it sticking out the side of my notebook and it busted all to pieces... Now, I am looking for a better one."
5,good seller,"Very quickly I received the item I've seen exactly, and I think it works well and smoothly,Really is goodregardsjose"
3,Serves the purpose,I had one before and it lasted for about 3 years. For the price I thought it was not bad. No problem with the shipment.
1,Longman Exam Skills CPE Writing Teacher's Book New Edition,"Useless, you may expect examples and many more tips on how to improve writing skills and not just solutions to the excercises proposed on the student's book."
5,Osprey's done it agian!,"'Bf-109 aces of the Russian Front' is a truly wonderful book! With 82 pages of wonderful drawings and photos and information. I especially loved it when I saw Erich Hartmann (with 352 kills) and Gerhard Barkhorn (301 kills) in the book. I thought the information on these aces was fantastic! The color plates are well drawn, always a plus when modeling, (I wish I had read this book before I built a Bf-109 in 1/32 scale and could have done Erich's plane).To read about the German pilots rack up almost unheard of scores while battling the deadly Russians is incredible. (If you want to experience some action for yourself, buy IL-2 Sturmovik PC game).This book is a must have for me and my collection of other Osprey and encyclopedia books. I'd give this book 6 stars, but that's not going to happen. This is only my opinion, but I think you'll really like this book after reading it.A truly great book! 5 stars all the way!"
3,"""Exultation is the going of an inland soul to sea""","This is a fine selection of the poems of Emily Dickinson.Dickinson is a great and distinctive poet of the kind who wrote concise, memorable , nay unforgettable lines and stanzas.Here are a few of her great beginnings.""Success is counted sweetest by those who ne'er succeed,To Comprehend a Nectar requires Sorest Need.""""Exultation is the going of an Inland Soul to Sea,Past the Headlands, Past the Houses into Deep Eternity.""""Are you Nobody? I am Nobody too.Then there's two of us, you know. """" I love to see it lap the hillsand likc the valleys up ..."" Parting is all we know of Heaven,and all we need of Hell. ""To read Emily Dickinson is to know what True Poetry is. In its , metaphorical density, brilliance of perception and intensity of feeling.After this one, get the Complete Poems and try to sense it all."
2,just remember,"do unto others as you would have them do unto you and whatever you sew, so shall you reap. these are basic universal truths that cut across all religious affiliations. if you use the rules as a manipulative ploy they will return to haunt you someday. it's simple karma. the rules may get you a wedding ring but i have never known that to be a guarantee of happiness. another universal truth that is a little more difficult to own is that we only attract to us someone that will reflect to us what is going on at the deepest core of ourselves. in other words we only attract mirrors. if you attract men that don't love you and respect you then what is it in you that is attracting these men? at this point the book is correct: love yourself and you will attract love."
1,Time Tested Secrets for Capturing Mr. WRONG,"If ever there was a book that deserved a negative rating, this book would be it.This book encourages immaturity, destructive relationship habits, disrespect towards the female's (and male's) integrity, and lowers the sanctity of the relationship to a mindless pool of headgames. It made me sick to read it.Readers would be advised to choose Barbara D'Angelis' book on ""The Real Rules"" if you need some good, sobering, and healthy advice, designed to counter the rules printed in Fein and Schneider's poorly thought out book for women."
1,Pig slop,"Why is this pig slop?1 - If you enter a relationship based on dishonesty, you'll wind up married to someone you don't know.2 - If a guy knows this is the game, and it's not really you, he will get turned off instantly.3 - The book tells a woman how to catch a man who enjoys the chase. Wouldn't you rather catch a man who enjoys you?4 - What kind of manners are based on not returning phone calls?I'm a guy, and I've read it. It's taught me how to avoid girls looking to follow the advice of some untrained pop-gurus. (These are pop gurus that lack the academic or professional background required to be taken seriously.)"
1,Getting what you want may not get you what you want,"A friend of mine used ""The Rules"" when she was dating the man who became her husband. It really worked! They got married! Then, less than four months after they were married, she told me that they didn't have anything to say to each other. She's in a dull and lifeless marriage. She's already prompted him to tell her about all the things that interest him while they were dating, and now she's run out of topics. He's still interested in himself, and he's never been interested in learning more about her. She was so single-mindedly focused on following the rules and snaring her man that she never noticed that they'd failed to develop any sort of mutual relationship. She followed the rules and she won the prize she sought. Or did she? You know what they say: be careful what you ask for..."
1,Ugh....,"Ok, I can understand telling women that they need to value their own life *outside* of a relationship, but these pathetic little mind-trips disguised as advice are NOT the way to do it. And as a feminist I will definitely report my disgust with the way men are portrayed here. Come on! Men are not the enemy ok? They're just other human beings in search of love. Sheesh. Whatever happened to honesty and respect? Without mutual honesty these techniques are merely a trap for marriage. Woe be to those poor women who believe that marriage is the be-all and the end-all of existence, and so will use any resource (such as this one) to get it."
4,GETS BACK TO MAKING IT WORK!,"All the RulesThis is a book I'd heard so much about, just had to read it. If more young girls followed these guidelines, life would be so much easier for them! Good even for a mother to read--excellent suggestions available for the too-available type!"
1,not even if it was the last book on earth,"I am recently divorced so I bought a couple of books that claim to be dating books. Of the 3 I bought, this one was the most ridiculous piece of entertaining junk ever...but there is no way I would take it seriously..not even if it was the last book on earth. What Men Want was almost as bad, although the three guys on the cover were cute. The best of the books is Recruiting Love by The Advice Sisters Dunham and Freedman. At least they urge you to be honest and encourage you to use your head, not lipstick and flirting, to get the love you want. As to THE RULES, I'd give it zero stars if I could, but this review site doesn't let you do that."
2,There are women who can learn from The Rules...,"... but the advice is best not taken literally! Having enough self-esteem to recognize & not chase after men who will never love you, and keeping a busy schedule & full life is not simply a matter of ACTING like you do.Taken literally, The Rules advice is not for everyone. Just the cover of this book tells you it's for women who see pursuit as a control game, and the prize is a diamond ring! My opinion is that being a ""Rules Girl"" is a primer on becoming a ""Trophy Wife"". There are indeed men out there who want ""A Woman Like No Other"", so if that's the kind of guy you want, read this book and more power to ya that his image of you doesn't tarnish.I'd recommend reading this book so you can form your own opinion, but if you're just looking for laughs, an even more concise, funnier book on having the upperhand in a relationship is by Karen Salmansohn: How to Make Your Man Behave in 21 Days or Less Using the Secrets of Professional Dog Trainers"
2,great book for MEN,"I picked up this book so I'd have something to read while my car was being detailed. I'd never heard of it at the time. As I read, I realized, yeah, they're right, you can get a man this way. But who wants a man who hounds you like a puppy dog? And what man would want a woman who resorts to these kind of headgames? After reading the book, I realized I would die if anyone ever noticed it on my shelves. The only reason I give it a 3 is that it has some merit for men...MEN, READ THIS BOOK...not all women are like this, but if you're getting the cold shoulder, maybe you should examine her bookshelves!"
1,This book is incredible!,"I would pursue a girl following ""The Rules"" for about five minutes. After getting brushed off once or twice, I'd move on to easier prey. Call me lazy if you like, but then, you have to call about 50 million guys out there lazy as well, because they're just like me.Hey ladies, why don't you, uh, be honest? It works better than playing stupid mind games."
1,Total nonsensical rubbish; doesn't even deserve 1 star,"I've seen Ms. Fein & Ms. Schneider on the talk shows and never have I seen two women more full of themselves. These women forgot one very important rule... DO NOT PLAY GAMES. Men despise games. Yet this whole book is a 'how to play games' in order to get a man. Men want one simple thing... to be loved and accepted for who they are. You don't need 'rules' to tell you what is just common sense.Women... you do not ""need"" this book! The sad fact is that many women feel they have to have a man to make them happy and fulfilled. No one can make you happy but YOU. If you have self-confidence and inner peace within yourself you don't 'need' a man to give you these qualities."
1,it's not a game,"Relationships aren't a game - nor are any two relationships identical. By all means - 'play by the rules' - but when people get hurt or things go horribly wrong, you have only yourself to blame.Perhaps then you might realise that it's time to start acting responsibly and in a mature way about your life and how it affects other people."
1,The first rule about Crazy Club is...,"You do not talk about Crazy Club.The second rule about Crazy Club is, you DO NOT TALK about Crazy Club.(Chapter 31 - Don't Discuss The Rules With Your Therapist)...because she'll tell you you're a moron."
1,Read this Book...,"especially if you want to be regarded as a B****! This is the manual that will ensure your life is sheer fantasy, until you get the ""prize"" the almighty ring. Then reality sets in. Degrading to women, as if we are unable to think, feel, speak, or support ourselves, but we are slaves to the male ego, never revealing anything about ourselves. This book creates manipulating wallflowers, destroys the positive self esteem of women and enforces weakness. Young girls could be ruined for life by this book. I am not a feminist, and loved to be treated by a lady, but I will not play such foolish mind games, no one should. Respect is what all women should demand.If you want to read a positive, intriguing book that captures the TRUE essence of what and how women should find a mate, read The REAL Rules by Barbara De Angelis. It is informative and allows you to be yourself, remain in control and have a meaningful and healthy relationship."
3,still not sure about this philosophy,"two years after my purchase of this book, I am still unsure if this is the way to go. Times have changed so drastically as have men, that I almost wonder if the men that love being the 'chasers' might never let themselves be caught. There are men that are shy and come across their dream woman, yet think she is unattainable. And if you follow this book, your dream guy could be thinking you are the one, yet he gets no clear signs of interest from you so he never does anything. If this book has all the answers, why is there a 'rules' bulletin board full of women trying to catch the right guy? This book reduces it all to a game, and if it really and truly worked, don't you think that all women would have found it, and found their man by now?"
2,Mixed Feelings.,"While I condone some of these ""rules"" for the simple reason that it's always better to take it slow, I highly disagree with one rule.The one that says in long-distance relationships, HE has to make the first 3 visits. I was in a long distance relationship a while back, with a guy that lived in Scotland. And I still look back on that as the most culturally educational experience of my life.Why? Because I got to see Scotland, Poland, Germany, London, and Amsterdam, not to mention parts of Canada (and of course my own hometown of Seattle). If I had obeyed that stupid rule, I would not be able to say I've been around the world!Because I disobeyed that rule, I have met so many nice people who I am still in touch with, I have taken amazing photographs, and I have grown up tremendously.So girls, Make that visit and get some culture in your life!"
4,The Rules AKA How to set boundaries with men.,"I am surprised at how many negative responses this book has received but it does prove 1 point; it has struck a nerve with many people. This book teaches women to set boundaries with the men they chose to date. I must admit it does have strong sexist overtones but some men do enjoy pursuing a women. Who doesn't like the thrill of the chase? Take the book for what it's worth and use it to your advantage. I would recommend this book to any woman who has always been known as ""the nice girl"". You were always understanding and willing to meet them halfway...unfortunately, men do not always appreciate it. Good book."
4,You have to give 'em a little credit,"I believe the intent of the book is better then just looking at the rules themselves. It's about loving yourself more and in turn having someone love you like you deserve.Some of the rules are a bit outlandish and unfair, but if you pick through the parts you can't live with I'm sure you'll find a little gold hidden in these pages.If nothing at all The Rules does give you confidence in yourself, and in my book that's at the top."
4,The Rules,This book is very informative for someone whose been out of the dating scene for a while. Really just some old fashioned views that I guess over the span of time never went away. It stresses that women should hold on to their morals and standards if they ever want to experience a real relationship with a man. It takes time but they guarantee it works!
5,The ultimate attraction book (for women),"Manipulative? Deceitful? Cynical? Yes, I would have to agree. But I have NEVER been so motivated by my girlfriend. I prefer the last part of the story. I always say this of my favourite books, but this is just REVOLUTIONARY."
4,Actually makes sense.,"I really enjoyed this book. It makes sense. It's really not about being desperate, but not being pathetic and settling. It kinda teaches you to stand up for yourself and expect what you deserve, and you deserve what you want."
3,This book is a first attempt at defining love and dating.,"This book has many positive aspects. But, I wouldn't recommend it to alot of people. It will protect you from making alot of dating mistakes. But, the book is juvenile in the sense that it emphasizes too much American dating values, which the rest of the world may have trouble swallowing.This book needs some work. But, it is a first good step towards a better and more fulfilling love life. I would say that this book is old-fashioned in a good way. It's not always good to focus girls on marriage when there are other alternatives."
3,A Good Job by Fein & Schneider,"The Rules will help a women weed out the losers (dating you for sex, fun, etc.) so she can have a better chance of running into the winners (men that respect & love her). The book offers great practical advice that goes beyond dating. THe Rules can also be used on friends, family. The basic massage throughout The Rules is self-repect and independence-WHAT WOMEN WOULD NOT WANT THAT!The only problem that I have with the rules: It makes it seem as if all relationship problems are the women's fault."
1,You've come a long way - not!,"A younger (24) colleague asked me (old -38- married lady) if she should move in with her boyfriend, because the book she's reading says... yes, it was this book, the biggest pile of c**p ever to waste chunks of rain forest in its publication. How on earth did this garbage ever get to the shelves? Who are these desperate women who would want to find the kind of guy who'd fall for this stuff? What brought us to the stage where we need some self appointed expert to make sweeping generalisations about men, women, life and love, assuring us that the same tricks (because that's what they are) work on everyone? If you want to know what men want, ask a man! FYI, I broke all the rules and am very happily married - don't waste your money on this drivel!"
2,Preying on Human Insecurity,"I think the authors could have written this book for men OR for women, with equal results for both. Anytime you play hard to get, and are still pursued, upon ""cashing in"" you'll get the same prize- a VERY insecure person. The person pursuing you is not interested necessarily in YOU, they are interested in trying to crack this ""mystery"" who is hurting their fragile egos. It's just a game which preys on insecurities. The authors even admit that rules girls aren't smarter (for sure!) or prettier than the average. So that person pursuing isn't ending up with much of a prize in the end either. They've only got a person on their hands that happens to have read a lame, wanna-be ""wife"" book. So, despite the fact that one may face some rejection in life, and we all do, it is comforting to know that some of those people doing the rejecting will get just what they deserve."
1,This is some really creepy stuff,"Do women with IQs above 35 actually believe this drivel? How does lying and manipulating one's way through the dating process create a lasting and secure relationship? The only part of the Rules phenomenon that I liked was taken care of by the Department of Schadenfreude: co-author Ellen Fein's husband left her, citing abandonment. Beautiful."
3,I have had success using these...,"I do some of the rules but not all of them. It is good to set limits, to keep yourself busy, and not get into a ""pretzel brain twist"" over some guy you just met! However, you should keep the situation in perspective.I do, however, insist on having the man pursue me & I'm a highly educated senior level programmer in my 30s who was divorced. It's just nature... the way men and women are. At first I was really hesitant to use these. I am a successful, educated career gal but the Rules work for me & have had my best success with dating using them."
1,Never judge a book by its cover.,"The title of this book says what you want, but the content does not deliver it. Hot guys didn't fall for these rules and I didn't like the kind of men drawn by these rules. My Mr Right has to be genuine, kind and intelligent. Someone I can relate to."
4,Good Book,"This is a good book. As a man, I can honestly say that I've been most attracted (and have fallen in love with) the women who weren't totally into me. However, I think Ellen and Sherrie go too far in some places. Not returning calls is a bit extreme. Also, not approaching the guy may be wrong. Guys are EXTREMELY shy around girls they are attracted to, and the large majority of the time, they are too afraid to approach. Just because a guy doesn't approach you doesn't mean he wouldn't love to get to know you. So other than that, I think the advice in the book is good. A woman having sex with you too early is definitely a huge turn-off."
5,"A ""MUST"" READ","Despite the many attacks that this book has been under(man hating feminists,etc.), it is a very useful guide for women who do NOT want to get hurt. Basically, if you don't make a fool of yourself(by chasing after someone who isn't interested), you won't get hurt. If you aren't the one making all of the moves, then you can't get rejected, right? Itworked for me-I'm getting married in Nov.!"
1,It works? Well what if it does...,"To quote one of the reviews of this book here:""It works!If you follow the Rules, you are assured of getting the man you deserve.""I'm sure that's quite true; if you think so little of yourself and men to follow these Rules you WILL getthe man you DESERVE. I'm still waiting to take a lookat these women's husbands...interesting that the authors won't allow them to be interviewed; I'm sure they're quite a catch! ::snort:: Forget the Rules and get a life instead!"
4,It brought my boyfriend and I closer together!,"I first heard about the ""Rules"" in a Newsweek article aboutCarolyn Bessette-Kennedy, who was reported to have followedthem. Out of curiosity, I bought the book and tried them out with my boyfriend of six years (see Rule 26). Immediately, he became more attentive and eager to spend time with me; the fact that he now knows about them hasn't diminished their impact. Moreover, my life outside our relationship has grown more fulfilling because I'm not wasting time obsessing about the relationship. The ""Rules"" worked for me!"
5,Old School Works...,I've read The Rules over and over. Personally I think this book is a great guide for women in realationships... it's especially good to read this when you're in the beginnig stages of one. It has some interesting ideas ('rules') that people just too often forget because they get out-of-control-excited with new relationships. Keep these... they work!
4,"For the self-respecting, respectable lady","With the death of my dad, my mom was hurtled into the ""singles scene"" after 45 years of marriage. She's been raving about this book, so I became curious enough to read it (although I'm a married woman).Pure and simple, it just makes sense. (Dr. Laura would be proud of these authors.)I wish I'd read it when I was single for some of its insights; I could've avoided some unpleasant consequences of dumb behavior.The behaviors it encourages should not come as a surprise to women of healthy self-esteem and self-respect; women who know their personal boundaries: ""ladies,"" in the true sense of the word.I thoroughly enjoyed The Rules."
1,Pathetic Pathetic Pathetic,"I m sure it is possible to attract some guys using the ""techniques"" explained in this book ( which is basically nothing new and same old play ""hard to get"" philosophy)but I certainly don't want any guy who can be attracted that way. If I have to play ""hard to get"" with the guy to attract him than I don't want him anyway. I want a genuine man who will be interested in me without resorting to the psychological warfare that this book recommends. And I DO believe such men are out there and can be had. I m not so pessimistic about male/female relationships that I need to use ""rules"" or ""methods"" to be in successfull, happy relaionships. A huge thumbs down to this book. I feel sory for all the women who have to use it to get a man."
3,Rules - Take Some Leave Some,"This was a good book, it would be better if it was updated to the 21st Century. Who has answering machines anymore? We need some updated rules that address text time response. Overall, some rules do still apply and I think if you adhere to them and adjust the outdated ones, you might have some luck."
4,awesome book!,"this was a really good book to read it gives you advice on how to catch a man using ""old fashioned"" techniques. ive used it several times to get a man and it works! being a relationship expert, my clients couldn't be more satisfied. [...]"
3,not applicable to me,"cuz I enjoy a good hunt for hunt's sake. Prey must be worthy and difficult to obtain. Impossible is fun too. Guess that doesnt really make me a lil wifey who just wants to get married. I buy my own diamonds and furs. Its more fun this way. If you are looking for a meal ticket, do read this book and use as prescribed."
1,"One or two gems, mixed in with a lot of advice on how to land yourself a place as a trophy wife","What concerned me most about this book was the multiple places where it encouraged you to keep the fact that you're following ""the rules"" a secret from your friends, family, and therapist. It explains that people may not understand and try to dissuade you. I have no interest in a program that all the people who I trust, who love and want the best for me, would try and dissuade me from. Keeping secrets from loved ones is a massive red flag for me that there is something wrong going on here."
2,Dishonest Squared - this book is way unrealistic,"This book is encouraging women to be so snobbish that a man will be too intimidated to even approach the women! I what Utopian fantasy is a man actually going to want to puruse a woman who constantly acts indifferent and cold and ""mysterious?"" Most guys are not THAT confident, and i don't even think they should be. I would think a guy was wierd if he tolerated such abusive treatment. And about not returning the phone calls! Please. If you don't return the phone calls, then he will assume you're just not interested. What's wrong with letting somebody know that you're interested with them anyway? It saves time, and it rules out all the men that don't like you in the first place. The rules does not let you be the way you want to be. They make you conform to this cold, detached individual that is not flesh and blood, but a stone cold statue."
1,I would rather be alone than follow The Rules!,"I couldn't stomach it. When I was young and foolish, I followed many of these suggestions (in existence for a long time before The Rules were written, believe me). I married the biggest jerk on the planet. Now that I am older and wiser, I've decided to be mentally healthy and love myself whether I am in a relationship or not. I give this book an F minus, frankly, and highly recommend any of Melody Beattie's books on codependency or Barbara De Angelis' The Real Rules for a more sane way to approach the whole relationship thing."
1,RUN for life.,"the perfect book for women incapable of secure attachment, now have the tools to reverse the role of doormat, and now be the abuser. Woopdeedoo. . . I would run from one of these women so fast. . ."
3,Decent concepts buried by stupidity,"If you take the book as a whole and use a lot of common sense, you can pick out pretty good concepts to practice. Basically, develop enough self-confidence to not beg or cling. If you don't want a man to think you're easy, don't act like you are. Don't allow yourself to be a last minute date because his other plans fell through. My male friends do admit that they WANT to 'pursue' the woman they are interested in.However, these ideas that aren't half bad are buried in one of the most annoying books I have ever read. I couldn't decide if I was being initiated into a cult or an eighth grade secret club: dare break one of ""the Rules"" and be miserable and/or lonely forever - no exceptions. Refraining from badgering your guy with phone calls is a good idea; never returning his phone calls is not playing ""hard to get"" - it's rude. (And did they really need to include a chapter on not dating married men??)"
2,Of limited value,"The Rules may be fine for ""catching"" a man (though it has problems in that area too), but what happens once the engagement or marriage takes place? Most women (including myself) would want to have a real emotional partner at that point in our lives, which requires the rules be set aside if that is to truly happen. And if the man was attracted in the first place because of The Rules being played on him, then what? A woman who used The Rules may find out that her man is there because of The Rules, and not because he has found a life partner that he connected with on a meaningful level. I think the book has more downside than upside."
4,Now it all makes sense,"I always wondered why my relationships started so nice, went so fast, and ended w/o any good reason. I thought I am the best and the nicest, so everyone should appreciate me. But then again, I saw the girls who are less attractive with nothing to show got the best guys. This book made me realize that the harder to get you are for a man, the more you are worth to him. Girls who are too nice are taken for granted, I've seen this in my relationships over and over.Only problem I have with this book is that, it might help you get a guy to marry you, but do you really get to know him when you are busy exercising these rules?"
1,yuck!!!!,"A terrific book for women with zero self-esteem who want to further hone their skills in becoming manipulative, controlling psychos.Ever hear about letting love happen? This book might be handy if you're a woman who hates herself so much she only longs for unattainable zeros, and needs quickie advice on how to ""play the game"" properly. An absolute disgrace."
1,I would pick zero stars if it was available in the drop box,"If there was ever a book that should be banned completely, this is it. All it tells women how to do is trick a man into falling for an act, and even if the woman can find a man who's really that stupid, she'll never be happy with him because she knows that he doesn't love the person she really is. If there is any use for this book at all, it is something on the line of firewood. Just be yourself. Don't be the b**ch this book tries to turn you into."
3,"So-So, but....","there's a better choice, in my opinion, for this information. I like the fact that The Rules advocates moving into an intimate relationship slowly but there are a couple of things that I think are rude. Such as not returning phone calls. I found it to be a bit harsh in places.As a result, I enthusiatically recommend What Southern Women Women Know About Flirting. It has good, solid advice but is always rooted in manners and courtesy. In addition to showing how to strategically play the game of love, it gives excellent advice on how to make yourself more appealing to others such as becoming a good storyteller and learning to talk about sports.I'm not a Southern woman but I love the way they think. And, I'm all for a gentle approach to capturing the man of your choice."
1,Real permanet relationships are not a game,"If you need this kind of game playing rules, that presuppose a situation, to create a relationship that you wish to be permanent, you will wind up disappointed and finish having abused your potential partner. Or maybe you can imagine the result if you told your potential partner of your rules when starting out. Would you like to be manipulated by the advice of women married to real woosies?More than likely a relationship growing form this lunacy will be completely one-sided and finish painfully for all."
4,Almost as good as the Rules for Getting Laid!,"I just bought another counter part to this title called The Rules For Getting Laid. It has the same format, the same impactful information, and the same sense of styles as these ladies, but much more over the top and much more to the point.To me the biggest downfall fo the whole Rules Girl model is that it doens't offer a very good analysis of what MEN want, rather more of an idealized female fantasy. Furthermore, the percision of the rules and the rigid interpretation leaves little space for the reader to ""go with the flow"" or simply see where a relationship is going.Once again let me contrast this with the Rules For Getting Laid. The authors are teaching men how to charm a woman, how to get her in bed, and how to fulfill their fantasies just as this book teaches wome to do the same."
3,deceptive,"It works, you go through the system, follow each rule, and as the authors say, you don't break any, at all. you may then turn into a really passive creature, forget how to make conversation, and become obsessive. this is not real life. the rules are great they work, but are psychologcally intimidating, and they take away your individuality. there is something more then just a set of rules for finding the right person, better to follow your intuition"
3,Thanks for the laughs,"Sure most of the stuff was true in the 50s and 60s, when parents had to be watchful, lest an unwanted pregnancy end dreams and a life. I agree that women should have their own lives, and jobs they love.However, this is 40 years after the birth control pill. Women now can control fertility and their future.Are there still men out there who are willing to pay for sex on the lifetime installment plan?The funniest part was the line about tilt your head forward and let your hair fall about the face, then tilt your head and smooth the hair back with your hand.I can imagine oodles of women doing this in public. Hilarious!What is the deal with therapists?Ladies, if you think giving flowers is a big event, listen to Tom. Flowers are the easiest thing to give, no thought required.Just think, once you have trapped the man of your dream you can then kill him slowly with lettuce sandwiches and marshmallows and other nonsense from women's magazines.Again, thanks for the laughs."
5,Back to basics,"While a little old-fashioned, it was actually quite refreshing to read this book. This book is about courting, plain and simple. I think if more women would follow the advice in this book, it would make it easier for the rest of us. I know that it's not for everybody, but it does make a lot of sense."
1,"Seriously, this is what century?","This book was suggested by a friend who stated she thought it was great! When I started reading the book I was intrigued by some of the information then started wondering what year I was in. If I was in my grandmother's era of growing up these things probably worked but it seems the tables are turning and men are not as easily wowed by feminine whiles.Secondly, I most of the information didn't pertain to me and my situation. I think this book would be for someone who is just starting to date, to keep a guy at bay but for those of us who have been in and out of relationships and in the ""dating scene"" this book was not too much help.I'm currently reading a book dated in the 16th Century and these suggestions seemed to work well in that era."
2,"Some truth in it, but who'd want to play this game?","For entertainment purposes, it possibly may rate more stars, but I found the dishonesty and gameplaying as a means to finding a mate to be a turn off. Female empowerment? I think not. It takes more character to be yourself, and you'll more than likely find a real man that will appreciate who you are."
3,Interesting Rules,"I'm a male who picked this up just to gain some insight into woman and dating. I must admit this book is hilarious and from the aspect of comic relief alone this book is a must read. As I look back it occurs to me the best relationships I've been in the women broke all the rules. On the other hand the woman that employed the rules didn't get a date with me or certainly didn't get 2nd, 3rd dates, etc, so I don't know how these rules can possibly lead to marriage since they seem to kill your chances of getting 2nd, 3rd or 4th dates.I do recommend this book for men who are often confused about the mixed messages we receive from women; it's probably because of this book or a similar one. If you're gonna play it's only fair to know ""the rules"" of the game."
1,Old school,Seemed insightful...if this wasn't the 21st century. This was not helpful for Today's dating experience. Left a lot to be desired and I would not recommend this read.
1,get a life,The only good advice in this book: get a life - man or no man! The rest is really really daft.I can only pray to God that there are no smart but insecure college girls reading rule 29 Tips for dating in College. That would be worse than them sniffing glue in chem lab.
1,"results guaranteed, just not necessarily the right results","If you follow the advice in this book, the person you end up with could only think of you as the best thing since sliced bread. But chances are that you're not, and therefore the person who thinks you are is a spineless sycophant. Those who believe a relationship should be built on mutual respect will skip this book or burn it, and those secure in their own imperfections won't bother with the charade of pomposity it prescribes. Be real."
1,Hm...,"The most interesting thing about this book is that Ellen Fein DIVORCED after the publication of this book (in 2001, I believe). Shouldn't this be a gigantic red flag for anyone considering buying this trash?I mean, aside from the fact that neither of them are qualified counselors, nor do they have any sort of professional background.Of course, I may have a personal hatred for this book, seeing as my own thrice-divorced mother decided that this was an appropriate gift for me... when I was only 12."
1,This Won't Get You a Man...,"It will get you a wussy-boy. No man with anything even resembling a spine is going to let himself be yanked around like these authors advise. Yeah, it will work on some males...but they won't be men: They'll be eunuchs with the emotional maturity and self-confidence of a fat, clumsy 12-year-old.Don't want to pay for your own meal at first? Fine, baby, eat alone.Don't want to return my phone calls? You might hear from me once more, but that's it.I can't believe that any man with an ounce of self-respect would play these games with anyone.Unbelieveable."
1,Worst possible 'guide' ever published,"This is the most despicable piece of work ever published, in my not so humble opinion. The fact that our culture pushes women so hard to find ""Mr. Right"" is something to be decried, not celebrated and wallowed in. If a woman is willing to manipulate and fake her way into any relationship, she doesn't deserve to be in one in the first place. What's happened to being genuine human beings? Men and women are not as at odds as popular media will have you believe. Throw away this book, sit down face to face with another person, and USE YOUR WORDS to have a conversation. Free and clear of deception and fakery is the best way to go. Don't waste your time, money or energy on this tripe."
1,Live by the Rules and be dateless,"My sister bought this book for a joke. Reading through it, I realized many women I came in contact with might be following these 'rules.' They played too hard to get and never encouraged my interest. They never returned smiles, and if they gave me their phone numbers never answered the phone but totally relied on their answering machines. Of course, if I left a message, they never returned my call. So I was left to assume they were not interested. I bet their will be some women in a few years past 30, dateless and mateless and wondering what went wrong."
1,Not Worth One Star,"I have to agree with those who would give this book a negative rating. Frankly, it isn't worth spending your time reading. The readers who referred you to Barbara DeAngelis' work should be applauded. But Fein and Schneider produced a mass market gem, didn't they? Trite, stereotypical and implies that a woman's mission in life is to find a man. Most of my male friends would be appalled as well."
4,truth hurts...,"Accurate and to the point, but should not be a surprise. The overwhelming fact is that most of the women readers who wrote in lambasting this book for one reason or another are either A)staring at the four walls and sitting by the phone waiting for ""him"" to call; B) lesbians who haven't figured out where they want to be in life, (or undecided whether they wish to remain lesbians); or C)those who say they want one thing, but respond to another. Critics aside, this book is the hard truth for some to accept, and second nature to those that have happy, fulfilling relationships."
3,Stop dating - read this book,"I was dating a woman who read this book. The end result of this reading was that we stopped dating.The clear message to any human in any kind of human to human relationship, in our modern age, is ""when several phone calls are not returned the person I'm calling is not interested in communicating."" When someone isn't interested in talking a relationship with that someone cannot be sustained."
1,BREAK THE RULES!,"If a woman is confident in herself enough to be herself without playing games, that is the person Mr. Right will fall in love with. Why be something you're not to 'land a man'? The fact this book became a bestseller is very disheartening. Women should be strong, independent and confident enough to find a great guy on their own without having to read how. Be original. Be yourself. Hold true to your own rules and burn this book"
3,Good advice/bad advice!,"This book gives some good advice about how to act on a date and how to play hard to get. However, you need to pick and choose the ""rules"" that you think are right. Come on... always wear lipstick, even if you're out jogging?? (As suggested in rule #1) I don't know about other women, but I exercise for myself, not to find a man!"
2,By the Way,"If you want the man to do what you WON'T do in the relationship in the name of ""self-respect"" (call, pursue, etc.) wouldn't you logically be able to say that the guy must not respect himself if he WILL do it? I think switching back and forth would be fair!"
1,Don't ever follow this rules !!!,"First I am a woman . I read this book to the end and throw in garbage right away , that my daughter never had a chance to read this stupid rules even accidently . I agree complete with Barbara de Angeles , with HER comments (in her book "" The REAL rules ')about this book . If I could I would give 0 stars for this book . My goodness , its scary how many American women loves this book , no wonder that more and more American men tend to create relationship with Russian women who is REAL and love REAL without stupid play games ."
3,"Review of ""The Rules"" Book","I bought this item thinking it will come with two books, actually there's only one.Apart from this, I received it correctly and quickly, so thank you for that.Nothing to add I guess,Have a good day,Pauline."
3,The Rules,The book was ok. I read it on a recommendation from a book club. I don't think this would have been something I would have purchased without the recommendation. It was entertaining but I'm not sure it is sound advice. Take it for what it is and read it on your down time out of curiousity.
1,How to Make a Mess of Your Dating Life,"As someone who has a background in psychology and counseling, I can say that this book is complete garbage. If honesty and integrity in dating and relatiosnhips are your goals, DON'T buy this book. It is pure manipulation and games, and will set relationships up to self-destruct over time. There are plenty of good books on dating - this one became a fad - hopefully, it has passed."
1,This book is horrible.,"My sister read this book and found it repulsive. Out of sheer curiousity I read this and was appauled. I am a 28 year old professional man and if I saw this on the shelf of a woman I was dating- I'd leave.This book lays the ground work for mind games that can only lead to mistrust in a relationship. If you want to attract a man who will in turn expect you to be barefoot and pregnant- follow these rules. We've grown since the 50's, why are these outdated ideas still around! If you want a modern man just be open and honest, this book suggests anything but that."
1,How june Cleaver scored the Beaver's dad,"When beooks of this sort sell this well, I have to stop and think, ""so that's what the Midwest is for."" The male self-help book equivalent must be titled ""Snagging a Sugar Momma in 12 Easy Steps."" Listen Stepford wannabes, time to get past your programming. Wake up and smell the Sanka June because if you actually find a guy who is slow enough in the head to let himself be put through the hurldes like a show dog, well, let's just hope you can teach him to go on the paper and not tear up the yard."
1,And that's a zero!,"A list of pointless suggestions written by two emotional losers named Sherrie Schneider and Ellen Fein, that take women through a time warp back to the days of waiting-for-him-to-make-the-first-move. Ms Schneider says that following The Rules will cut down on domestic violence, an opinion that makes me want to don jackboots and big, hairy hands and give her a good thrashing, so that she can spout about it with some authority instead of placing the blame on the woman. A tome that not only insults the intelligence and integrity of women everywhere, but that of men as well. The only thing the publishers of The Rules left out were the perforation holes, that we may tear out the pages in the event of an international lavatory paper shortage."
1,Just for models,"If you dont look like a model, or if you sometimes feel insecure and/or ugly, I think the rules wont work for you.If you think men are toys to be manipulated and are ALL so stupid that they wont forever see the true you, then this book is for you. The rules might get you a very insecure and/or stupid man, or a smooth casavona who can match your pretentiousness.If you dont own the world, orif you sometimes struggle through life like the rest of mankind, buy a serious book.These authors are making money out of peoples insecurity.There are better books out there."
2,I'm A Guy,"I am a male, so, according to all of you women, I know absolutely nothing. But I thought that my words may help at least one of you. (or perhaps I'm just venting?)I hate, with unmitigated passion and with the burning of a thousand suns, the woman who would treat my heart as a toy and my love as a game.I am a man: thoughtful and passionate; strong and wise; responsible and free; full of constancy and feelings - real, deep, genuine, and true. And they are guarded (as I assume are yours) from anyone who may operate and manipulate themselves and others by any such ""rules"".Play them as you wish, but we are not all fools to be played. Nor all we all players who play.And I would ask that any who found advice in this book to not control simpler men like puppets. Your beauty and clever whit natually overcome ours, as our strength naturally overcomes yours. Take it easy on us. Thank you."
1,desperate people take advice from strangers(authors),"what kind of man would want a woman who lies, manipulates, plays games, and all the other stuff thats in this book? why would a man who cares, want to spend time with a woman who does this?the kind of men this book attracts, are men who like games, lies, and manipulation. this is a man who is more interested in the ""game,"" than he is in you. games get old. and people get tired. so dont be surprised if at some point, he does the same things to you. or says goodbye.whether you like it or not, be yourself. dont deny the truth. ask a guy out if you want. call him if you want. if he is the right one, he will love and spoil you because he WANTS TOO! do you women have any idea how good it feels to be in love?if you are a desperate woman, go ahead and take advice from two strangers(authors) who wrote a book to make money.oh, gee, one author got divorced. time-tested? now thats funny."
1,0 star and now in the trash can,"The Rules do not work on guys like me and I am one of those hot guys whom women would initiate conversations with when I go to bars. I don't sleep around and have been looking to settle down.What kind of naive women would buy in these rules? The kind I will call a couple of times, get frustrated then move on, and never look back. The authors were out of their minds writing these garbage. 0-star recommendation to no one. Some 1-star reviews made more sense than the book itself."
4,A grain of truth and an ocean of humor,This book is very entertaining but shouldn't be taken as seriously as many seem to view it. There are truths in the book simply because men are hunters by nature and when women act as the hunted the men will chase. You are pretending to be a rules girl and will get a rules man but be sure that is the kind of man you wanted to catch.
4,Interesting to read,"I'm married and got this more for fun than anything. I disagree with many parts but it does have some information that I thought was good and useful and that I will in fact use, but in a non-manipulative manner. The hardcover price is outrageous, but the paperback price is reasonable."
3,The Rules or Guidelines?,"I enjoyed this book and learned a few things that I was doing wrong. That was worth the price of admission.The book documents several ways to end up getting married to a man that your are interested by following these ""rules."" A few of them I had some issues with, like forgetting about a guy that doesn't call within 24 hours of meeting them--but some were very useful. So read this book with a grain of salt and you will come around to liking it. The rules are very applicable to today."
1,There are no easy answers,"I know of more than one woman who followed ""THe Rules"" to a T and consider it a wild success because it did indeed get them married. Married to men who are overbearing and have little consideration for them as ""holistic beings"" but rather they are always ""performing."" It seems laborious on a long-term basis and the women are not gratified. I also know several women who followed the rules religiously during the dating process and the men ended up just being the wrong men who were unable to reciprocate their wish for a substantive relationship, leaving them feeling even more like failures because they did everything right! Would that there were easy answers though this book has some good points to make, it's no guarantee that you'll ""capture your Mr. Right."" The authors make no allowances for thes kinds of scenarios which, sadly, are all too common."
3,Playing the Rules,"While this book did have some good aspects to it, there are some of the rules that should not be followed. For example, one of the rules states that a woman should never call a man (for anticipation). My male friend responded to this with, ""Pretty soon the man will stop calling because he thinks she isn't interested"". Some of the rules did make sense, and I do practice them myself. This book was good to read for fun by the pool, and I had a lot of fun discussing and laughing over personal stories with some of my girl friends, and analzying some of the rules with the opposite sex. I would not take the rules to heart, but it is a fun read, especially with a group of people to share it with. Good luck with the dating!"
1,This tale-telling book is so outdated.,"This book's got to be a big joke. The advice doesn't stand trial in reality. It tells tales to women who are desperate for any men. A normal guy with IQ over 70 will see through these rules. Being self-serving or playing games in relationship will suffocate you eventually. All my friends prefer natural loving women who have comon sense and courtesy in dating. Those men who wlll fall for these unhealthy rules are not true love materials......unless you are fishing for a boring marriage. Please stop this ""rules girls"" insanity.....it is so outdated!"
1,Self-absorbed excursion into twit-dom,"This book is written for vacuous, self-absorbed, materialistic ""wittle"" girls who have to use manipulative, childish methods of passive-aggressiveness instead of intelligence, warmth and maturity to win men. If certain kinds of men fall for the ""rules"" enclosed therein, they deserve to be pushed around like that, and need to grow up and become MEN, not remain prehistoric, neanderthal momma's boys. Appalling, wretched excess, and a contributor to the inherent stupidity of most relationships. Ugh!"
1,This book makes my heart ache,"The best thing about this book is the way it always reminds me HOW THANKFUL I am that 1. I didn't know about the rules when I started dating 2. I have the kind of relationship I do -- nothing like what the Rules prescribes. He loves me despite my strange aspects, even when I don't wear makeup, and when I'm grumpy or don't feel like being an enchanting person. I am so grateful to the fates (or whoever) for managing to avoid this sort of advice until I found him. Otherwise, who knows what would have happened. Certainly, if I'd never returned his calls he would have gone away hurt, and I'd never feel secure enough to be myself around him (especially if I'm expected to jog in lipstick). I am only reminded every time I read it how truly lucky I am, in many, many ways."
3,How to Trade Your Soul for Comfort.,"Buy this book with ""The Prince"" by Niccolo Machiavelli today! This is a modern manual for women on how to land a sucker by being controlling. Should be read by potential suckers, as well as anyone else curious about the thinking of those not blessed with moral understanding."
3,"Okay, if not this set of Rules, create your own!","There was some good solid thought-provoking rules. Yes, there were some shallow and silly ones, too. Fact is, rather men admit it or not, they definitely have rules and codes they use on women. The fact that the most of the male reviewers have ridiculed this book means it has some merit. Also ladies, if you don't like Ellen and Sherrie's Rules, at least establish some of your own. Men do!"
5,"It works, I know!!","I was 45 and had been divorced for seven years when I met him. I used the principles in The Rules and we were engaged in eight months and married six weeks later. That was three years ago and we are still delighted with each other, enjoy each other's company and have no regrets. We didn't hold hands till we were engaged, didn't kiss till our wedding night. We loved and respected each other and it paid off!Try it for yourself, it works! Thanks Ellen and Sherrie!! God bless you both!LynnAustralia"
1,TEACHES YOU TO DISRESPECT YOURSELF!!!!!!WORST BOOK POSSIBLE,THIS IS THE WORST BOOK A WOMAN COULD EVER BUY ON THE SUBJECT OF RELATIONSHIPS.THIS IS A BOOK FULL OF MULNIPULATION OF FIRST THE WOMAN THEN THE MAN.THIS BOOK IS VERY SIMILAR TO BLACK MAGIC AND CULT LIKE THINKING.IT BRAINWASHES YOU INTO THINKING YOU ARE EMPOWERED AND GETTING SOMEWHERE..WHEN IN ACTUALLY YOUR NOT EMPOWERED BECAUSE TRUE POWER COMES FROM BEING WHO YOU ARE!!!!! AND ATTRACTING THE RIGHT MAN FOR THE REAL YOU!!!!!IF YOU WANT TO BE SET FREE.BUY BARBARA DE ANGELIS.THE REAL RULES!THAT IS A MASTERPIECE.IT'S THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH.IN A PRECISE AND SIMPILIFIED WELL WRITTEN BOOK.
2,If I am Not Mistaken,"....I believe that one of the authors of this book is divorced. Hmmmmmm! Ladies always know that you are a child of God! I have a renewed spirituality--and I feel great. I am fun, loyal, honest, and beautiful--I ""feel"" it in my soul--where it counts--that means I don't just ""think"" it. I want to ""attract"" a man, not ""hook"" him. I do agree that you should not chase after someone--but, if someone doesn't love you for you. Well......hmmmmmmm! God Bless!"
2,I was reading....,"well, I was reading some of the reviews, 18 of them. All the confusion makes me actually scared of the book! It was either, ""the book is totally the best"" or ""this book is trash!"" I finnally found one that made me feel better about myself & this person made me feel less tense about marriage & dating. I guess the only true people I can rely on are myself & my mother. My mother is probably like the rules & I am just hoping along the rocks & not getting hurt since I have never dated. I am sure I have taken the wrong start of a certian road called ""figuring guys out"", but that doesn't make me want to fall to the ground & cry. I realize there are many types of people out there: they can get hurt easily, or are hardly hurt by men.....Please don't take all the rules seriously since some of them are silly & I bet some are good too! so whatever you want to do...buy the book or read reviews, take with you on your journey your mind."
1,ladies-get a clue and get a calendar,"OK. I do agree with a few of the things in this book, like maybe he should call me more instead of me calling him. But please, these methods might have worked fine in the 50s, but hello! What year is it? A woman does not have to have a husband to be a complete person. Love yourself first, then worry about finding ""Mr. Right.&quot"
4,"rebuttal to ""Ha, Ha""","The book does not recommend lying as one reader who ""skimmed 60% of it"" says. In fact it advises to be honest at all times. It advises healthy boundaries and not giving out too much information too soon.I say if what you have been trying in the past hasn't worked it doesn't hurt to try a new approach."
1,Do we really need to regress to the 1950s,"Any man who thinks a woman should be braindead and submissive isn't worth having! And any woman who instructs other women to behave like they're braindead and submissive should be ashamed of herself!I understand one of the authors is getting divorced, so ""the rules"" apparently didn't work very well for HER."
1,Sigh...,"This book helps to confirm the widely held theory that life, unfortunately, is simply a continuation of high school."
2,Love is not a game,"A born romantic,I approached this book with much worry. What have us human beings come to ,relying on rules to get us through our love lives. Love is the most natural emotion in the world. It is free and should happen freely not forcefully. I imagine a lot of people have emerged after reading this,and putting these so called Rules into practice,Love finds us ,we shouldnt go looking for it and if you cant fall in love with someone naturally and be yourself,then its a book on self-esteem you should be reading.Sure I have suffered unbelievable heart ache but it helps grow stronger.I dont have to think when Im in love, I dont have to worry whether its ok to call my boyfriend at three o clock in the morning to tell him I think Im falling for him,cause if thats what I have to do so be it and damn the consequences.Sure this book is good if your feeling bitter and broken hearted but no book in the world is gonna save you from that anyway."
2,"If a ""Rules Girl"" dates a ""Rules Guy"", when do they talk?","The only good things about this set of ""Rules"" are the partsthat stress independance and self-esteem. I feel that allof the game playing is a waste of time and dishonest, but Ihave to agree that if someone doesn't call you, he most likely is not interested and you should make other plans. Waiting around for ""the one"" to call, mooning over every word he utters, is ridiculous. Having friends and interests outside of the relationship is healthy, and a good ""rule"" for everyone."
3,Good if you want a lame guy.,"They should change the name of the book from "" The Rules"" to "" How to catch a whuss. Any man who falls for this stuff clearly is not an Alpha Male. Some of the rules apply to men who have no other options. Remember Ladies, men will pursue you doing this stuff ONLY if they have no other female options. (real options) I dated a woman and after reading this book, realized she must be following the rules. I dumped her and the last time I checked she was still single. I am sure many of the women who found Mr Right actually found Mr "" Yes dear."" I gave it 3 stars because It may actually work for some women but they will end up with a "" Whuss-Band."" If you want a real man, be real. This is also a classic for any potential Gold Diggers."
1,"This is a ""How To"" on building a LOUSY relationship","If you want a DECENT relationship - read Susan Page's ""If I'm So Wonderful Why am I Still Single"".The Rules will get you what you deserve:1. A relationship built on manipuilation and lies.2. A guy who wants you because he believes he can't get you. This is someone you think will be a good person in a committed relationship?This book proves that there are women who can be just as big a jerk as a man can be."
1,A damaging book!,"Why in the world would you do things that nearly all men don't like??? How would you like it if he very rarely returned your phone calls? How would you like it if he seemed disinterested in you? Treat him the way you would like to be treated. Also, most men are like kids wanting a particular toy. If he can't have it, he will want it even more. It doesn't mean he will treaure it. DO THE THINGS MEN LIKE; NOT THE THINGS WOMEN THINK MEN LIKE. Read ""How To Find And Marry The Man Of Your Choice."" This is what will work on men!Perry Rose, author of ""I Love You...Will You Marry Me?!"""
4,Just A matter of Who Is In Controle?,"On the whole,the book,respect,the different roles of a man and a woman.Moreover,it stresess that women should act in a very conservative way,as they used in the very past years.I remeber,the advice of my grandmother,was almost the same as the RULES.However,times have changed,as we all know,though men love difficult and hard to get women,they still love women who light their fires.In fact,my openion,is based on my reading to a book called LIGHT HIS FIRE,for an author called,Ellen Kreidman.Moreover,it depends on the personalities of both the man and the woman.To tell you the truth,i started my relationship with my boyfriend using LIGHT HIS FIRE,but now i'm using THE RULES,to light his fire more."
1,How to attract stalkers!,A great book on how to attract aggressive guys and stalkers. Guaranteed to scare off any men who care about other people.
4,could be useful,"The best part of this book is at the end where they list specific cases and approaches / recommendations to the women. The second part is better than the first one. Some of the rules need to be generalized as the dating reality outside of USA is not like that. I am not convinced I want to marry for sure but I do like the idea expressed in the book - in order to be happy with yourself and to have people (men, kids, women) treat you as precious you need to follow some rules of conduct. Those should come naturally to a woman who loves, respects and takes good care of herself."
1,"A waste of ink, shelf space, time, & paper...","GOD! What era are Ellen & Sherrie living in? I laughed & laughed at this stupid piece of trash that called itself a book. But the scary part: some women fall for this stupid crap! I mean, get this: ""Hike up your skirt...Never go dutch or call a guy...act cool & disinterested"" Come oooon! This is the nineties. On top of that, it's absolutely RUDE not to return calls and to always expect a guy to be the one to pick you up and drive you around and pay for everything. Barbara DiAngelis had the right idea when she wrote the ""Real Rules"" ""The Real Rules"" talked back to this stupid excuse of a book!"
1,This can only damage you-- if you're not the 'right' type.,"The Rules is a really self-destructive book for some... and a savior for others. It taught me how to handle myself in a way those other books couldn't. I'm not emotional, and it takes years for me to get attached to anyone, even friends. This book taught me how to use my 'coolness' to my advantage. HOWEVER, this book is not for everyone. Some people are very emotionally warm, and need closeness and togetherness in a way I don't understand. The Rules, if followed, could only hurt them, especially in the long run."
1,So offensive I nearly can't describe,"This is the book that receives such a trashing in the latest Michon book, ""Grrl Genius Guide to Sex."" And for good reason. Women, in this telling, are manipulative creatures who lure in a man, tricking him and lying to him, following not her own heart but a cold blooded pursuit of a man by attempting to exploit his weaknesses. I'll confess I read the whole thing because I was completely horrified to think that there are any women out there like this! It made me ashamed of my gender.I believe these rules would work--if you don't care about love or happiness, but are only interested in finding a shallow, stupid man with a lot of money. Don't read this if you have a heart, it isn't for romantics, it is for sociopaths."
5,Essential reading for every woman,"As a strong advocate of woman's liberation and independence, I read The Rules with a great deal of skepticism. Yet the further I read, the more enlightened I felt. All those men I had never liked were precisely the ones that kept chasing after me. The Rules, though used inavertantly, had worked. After reading The Rules, I began to put them into practice with the ones I truly wanted and slowly but surely I noticed changes. Now, looking back on previous failed relationships, I can precisely pinpoint the rules I broke. The authors are simply applying the laws of basic human nature, laws that remain constant through time. Intelligent women should look at this book and evaluate it on the true basis for truth: whether it works. And The Rules definately fit this category!"
4,How I'm helping my friend,"I have a friend that has seen 'How to lose a guy in ten days' and didn't get it. She also read 'He's just not that into you' and didn't believe a word the authors said. She calls me and my sister for advice all the time but doesn't listen to us either. This is the girl who call or texts 10+ times a day and considers you a boyfriend after one date. I was talking to my boss about her and she told me to get her this book because this book is the way she found her husband. I have a serious boyfriend and haven't had trouble with relationships in the past, after skimming through the book I realized this isn't a book for people who are not relationship-challenged. I think it will do her a great deal of good, fingers crossed"
1,You Have Got To Be Kidding Me!,"A book that is all focused on getting a man to slip a ring on your finger is going to involve some trickery and manipulation. Is that how you should treat the person that you would like to be with for the rest of your life? I really hope that is a rhetorical question for most of us.If you can't find a mate by simply being yourself, maybe you are better off single. My God, it seems like some of the audience that this ""book"" is targeted to would rather become lepers than admit they are unmarried at 35. Give me a BREAK!I cannot believe that women would actually purchase this book! Talk about setting woman's rights back 100 years! Give up your suffrage if you read this!"
4,Good tips,"I read this book when I was 18,I dated a looser who did not treat me well.Raised w/out a dad and a mom who had a big heart but no clue of what was going on in my life,I did not receive advise on how I should be treated.I did not follow every rule but I took in some good tips which truly helped.At 35 now I still think it was a good book to have so I just bought it for my 18 yr old stepdaughter hoping it does the same."
1,Hmmmm...,I'd say this is just about the worst book ever written. Gotta be in the top five or six anyway.
2,This book is for the mindless,"A book of rules for mindless, low self esteam, can't think for themselves type of girl. This book will teach you how to be someone you are not. So if you your desire is to be fake, shallow and unreal...follow the rules."
1,I hope this is just a joke,"This is probably one of the biggest wastes of paper I have come across in a long time. What are wetrying to do here? Any book that promises to catch ""Mr. Right"" obviously doesn't believe in havingany type of real, intimate relationship. Especially not if Mr. Right is captured by denying thatequality is an essential in any relationship. I think it is a sad statement of society when thisbook is on the bestseller's list and people are actually buying into this.Please, Ms. Fein, don't waste our trees or our time."
1,Yeah.,"I opened the book and my face subsequently dropped in my hands. Eh, this stuff can really screw you up. The same goes for the pick-up books for men. If you are a normal person, you probably are not even on this Amazon page, but just live life normally, correct mistakes along the way and you will be infinitely happier living life without thinking about spending life considering manipulating or controlling people. It really is that easy."
1,Don't waste your money!!,"Playing games is not the way to meet a man which is what this book is all about. Not returning phone calls is rude! Who cares who calls who or who ends the conversation first! Why lie and say your busy? Honestly and be yourself is what I say. If I was a guy and someone did not call me back or played games, I would not waste my time! This book is a joke and stupid!!"
2,It Creates More Problems Than It Resolves,"Obviously, this book has helped a few women (many, maybe) not to pine for their prospective mates and allow men to chase them. Good enough.Yet, at times the advice is counterproductive and even dangerous. For instance, men are at times supposed to go to extremes just to get a first date (not to talk about the following ones). One can get some fun out of the Dating Masquerade and subsequent role-playing of Good-Noble-Patient Provider and Swept Away, but can you build a true and lasting marriage on that? What if in the course of the Dating Masquerade, or even after the Altar Convention, either Swept Away finds a Better Provider or Good-Noble-Patient Provider finds a More Easily Sweepable? Wreck is imminent.Take it lightly and don't exaggerate. There's good sense to everything... Mr. Right knows it, and Mr. Left too."
1,Guys Are Stupid!,"Girls, don't follow the rules in this book. Only guys that'll keep playing are losers and obessive. Guys are stupid and if you don't return calls they'll think you're not interested in them. After a week you'll never hear from him again. The book is a good read for a few laughs."
2,o c'mon,"Don't follow these rules, period! While this book's got some good points for women who wear their hearts on their sleeves, this book is more for the value of getting the fame. You gotta admit it, there are many nice and successful guys out there who are shy, have thin faces, or just simply don't know how to deal with women. If you play too hard to get by following the Rules here, you might miss out on a lot of great guys. Wake up girls! Read The Seduction Mystique by Ginie Polo Sayles instead. That book will truly help you."
3,A man's view,"A note to the women who would like to read this book:I've read it, and it's definitely entertaining. Many of the authors' suggestions are good- many guys (myself included) are looking for a great relationship with an independent woman. That's why I picked it up! Many of their techniques will work, and you should try some of them- making a guy call you, making him chase you for a date, etc. The only caveat is, I think if you take it too seriously, and adopt it as an ideology, you will be manipulative. If you want to date openly, expect that a man will too, and that he may lose interest in you. And you might get a venereal disease. That's really my only problem with it- I'm not interested in having an open relationship myself, and I'm not interested in a woman who's having one either. Otherwise, I think their advice is quite sound. Be yourself, go after your dreams, dress well, and don't be afraid to flirt! We'll chase you if we're interested."
2,I think we have more going for us,"The Rules imply, both directly and indirectly, that a woman doesn't have what it takes to get a man interested in her and keep him interested. She has to rely on subterfuge. If a woman doesn't have a lot going for her, then I suppose The Rules can only improve her chances! But for most women that do have something to offer as a potential girlfriend and/or wife, using The Rules could make guys (who, btw, are privvy to this stuff by now) wonder if the woman they're interested in is really ""all that"" if she has to rely on The Rules instead of on her own fine qualities! Having to use The Rules seems like an admission of being a ""less than attractive"" woman. I'm not sure I want to label myself as such"
1,"Yes, you too can get a man to marry you...",..if you just follow these Rules.But will they help you KEEP him? I dunno...And Ellen Fein is getting a divorce.I rest my case.
1,"These ""Rules"" should be broken!","Two well-meaning women giving the worst possible advice. They advise not to return a man's phone calls, not to reveal anything about yourself until he slips a diamond ring on your finger, etc... What nonsense! I ask the author's to put themselves in the man's shoes. Would they like their phone calls unanswered? Would they like to spend several hours with a man and come away knowing absolutely NOTHING about him? If you want good advice, read Barbara DeAngelis's ""The Real Rules"". It was written specifically to counter the garbage in ""The Rules""."
3,Some Points are Good - Some aren't,"The Rules give some good pointers and encourage a woman to lead a life outside of pursuing a man. Rules like ""Don't Accept a Sat. Nite Date after Wed."" are basically saying ""Don't put your life on hold or be so readily available"" if a man asks you for a date which I think is good in building self-confidence. Other Rules such as ""Don't call him or rarely return his calls"" - I don't necessarily agree with. I think it's rude not to return calls from anyone. The Rules also encourage the woman to be aloof and play hard to get but to me, I think men are more attracted to a woman who is friendly and outgoing as long as you don't go overboard. The dating game is mostly common sense - this book basically enforces this."
2,"Useful counterintellingence, but that's it","Men might find this worth reading to see when the Rules ploy is being used against them and steer clear. I doubt this will work for many women, though. The Rules is based on the assumption that men love games and puzzles and will therefore enjoy a woman who plays hard to get. Sorry, but I solve enough puzzles at work as a software developer. Dating is already enough of a puzzle, thank you. It doesn't need to be harder. Not all the advice is bad, but the overall idea is. If you don't act interested, most men (including myself) will assume you're not interested and move on. Contrary to the authors' belief, I don't want what I can't have, nor I am interested in pestering someone who says they aren't interested. Why be a stalker?"
1,Personality disorders,"The concepts behind The Rules explain why more than 50% of marriages in America are failure. The authors apparently mistook being rude as being interesting, and playing hard-to-get as being snobbish. Unfortunately, they did summon a flock of followers. Sad but true, women who suffer from personality disorders tend to buy in these Rules concepts. See more in the following link.http://www.nomarriage.com/disorders.htmlOverall, this book misleads women into thinking Mr. Right should be submissive and obsessive to them. In reality, quality men aren't like that. Successful men and women are too busy and occupied to deal with the immaturity in these rules. Playing hard to get is an art of seduction. Seduction techique varies depending on the individuals. It is far from prudent to name a set of rules for all. I recommend to bypass this illy written book."
2,Good advice for those who don't know any better,"You know, the authors of this book really seem to have hit a nerve. It's interesting that a book whose main advice is ""Don't let him see that you are an immature twit who only cares about catching a man"" is such hit. Clearly, there are women in the world who needed to have it literally spelled out that acting like a twelve-year-old will not usually result in a successful relationship with an adult male.I guess for those women, this book is good. However, for those women who already have a balanced perspective regarding the role of men and romantic relationships in their lives, and for those women whose gut instincts generally result in constructive acts and healthy communication, this book is beyond ludicrous."
4,"Don't hesitate, pick it up!","I dated a man for 5 years who would not settle down. After reading this book, I moved on, and he came back with a ring and a date! We are now happily married with 2 great children.To address those who don't like the book:Women - these are not antifeminist, but tried-and-true methods of increasing your self-esteem while attracting a man who loves you for you. Don't be anyone but yourself, but be your best you. Don't call men; if they want you, they'll call. Trust me, I know!Men - The Rules may seem like manipulation, but they're really methods of helping a woman hold back while you decide how you feel about her. Once you have and love a woman, wouldn't you rather she maintain her own life rather than always want to be at your side? Besides, if you are the kind of man who likes a woman to say ""I love you"" first, you are in the minority."
1,Gimme a break!,"This book is great for women who believe that the men in cheesy romance novels actually exist. In the real world, people (not just men) don't appreciate being manipulated in the way that this book suggests that we should. I feel that this book is very out-of-touch for today's young women, when men ARE NOT playing by the rules the authors say they are. Furthermore, it perpetuates the old stereotype of women being pretty (p. 16, ""Diet and exercise and The Rules have a lot in common. P. 17, ""Men like women who wear fashionable, sexy clothes in bright colors. Why not please them?"") and quiet (Don't talk to men first, don't return his calls, and my personal favorite quote on page 61, ""Smile a lot, and don't feel obligated to fill up the lulls in the conversation.""). If you're a feminist, like I am, or just a woman with a firm grip on REALITY, for the love of God, don't read this."
1,Read it and weep,"Just one question: What kind of man could you possibly ""catch"" by behaving in such a phony and manipulative way? The authors seem to forget that after you reel in this big fish you have to actually live with the guy. And at some point you're going to have to (gasp!) start behaving like a normal human being.As a woman, the success of this book depresses me. We must be a desperate gender to push this drivel to the top of the charts."
1,And I thought guys wrote ridiculous advice books...,"on this subject. Ladies, if you want to better improve your chances in finding that right man, don't read this book. If a woman was to ever pull this stuff on me, I would stop calling her. Geeez! ""Don't talk to him for too long over the phone""?! ""Be mysterious and quite when on that first date""?! I want to be with a woman who is fun to be with. One who asks me questions and wants to know about me and my life. A man likes it when she shows him interest. Ask him out on a date every once in awhile. Read THE REAL RULES. Now that's a good book."
1,The Rules,I don't care what this book says. Any woman who doesn't return my phone calls is getting the boot.
5,It's still a classic,I love this book! I have read it 4 times in the past 5 years! Every woman should read it at least once.
1,bunk!,bunk!do what u want when it comes to dating.like duh?i think the ruls book does have some common sense in it but then it TOTALLY goes off the deep end with some real nutty behavior suggested.if you do want to read this book-pick it up at your local library.and check it out with the mind-set that this is a total humor book. only.it upsets me so much that so many women take this book so seriously like they have no mind of their own.BUNK BUNK BUNK BUNK BUNK!
1,Games never work for long term relationships,"You need to find someone who compliments you, I know it sounds trite, but when you've had it, you know. This book is a JOKE at best and will not guarantee a long lasting relationship. Manipulating a man into proposing to you for one is not romantic and secondly basis your relationship on dishonesty. Finding someone who's your best friend, who you can learn from and he learns from you--that's a good start. All relationships take work and each one we learn something new about ourselves of what works and what does not. Playing games will get you nowhere but a divorce in the end, just like your two authors of this book. Looks who's lauging all the way to the bank, these over the hill princess wanna be's with no husbands. Hope they enjoyed their small amount of success!"
2,You figure it out.,"I once knew a girl who wanted a husband so bad she would have married Godzilla--if he'd asked. Boy, did that turn me off! On the other hand, I knew a girl who played so hard to get that I wanted her more than anyone else in the world--until I got her. Now I think that if there was one rule on how to get the right one, the word would have gotten around by now, and we'd all be living happily ever after. You figure it out."
2,Men should read this book,"Men, read this book so you will know which women to avoid. Men if you find out a woman uses this book kick her to the curb and find a real woman.Women could just learn to be kind, caring and honest but...oh that is too much work...nevermind.This book is full of crap, like only answering one of every four of his emails? Ha...what a joke. If she wouldn't answer my email why would I keep writing her?No wonder online personals are packed with grossly overweight females with a brood of offspring making demands as to ""what they want in a man"". Thank God I'm no longer in the game and am spoken for."
4,An interesting book,"An unusual way to dating. For women. Do I agree? Yes, with certain reservations.It is a book helping women to treat themselves with respect and dignity. A book that will teach them how to put themselves first before any man. To believe in themselves rather than give up on the first man who smiles at them.I would definitely recommend it to all women who forget about their lives and their career after the first date.By Thei Zervaki, a career and business coach......"
1,"Beware of this book, "" the rules"" written by Histronic woman","please review this message before reading ""the rules"" [...]As a psychology student I was shocked at this book and its manipulative tactics where outright disgusting and showing the writer as probably disorder specifically a cluster B personality disorder. Manipulation is the core of this book. Buyer beware."
5,Beverly's Review,"I really enjoyed reading this book.If you like poetry, erotic reading and love stories, you will love this book. It's about friendship, love and life. Alvin Lloyd Alexander Horn is a talented author and very descriptive in his writing. You can mentally visualize the scenery and the characters. There is an element of surprise and mystery through out the story. This is a romantic and very sexy novel with a wonderful ending."
5,AWESOME,I would recommed this book to anyone that enjoys this kind of writing. This book held my interest from the beginning to the end of it. I have read several books by different authors but this one by far the best book i have read. I can't wait till his next book comes out. only one word to describe about this book AWESOME!!!!!
4,Hot!,"If you're looking for a romantic get away, this is your book!I was swept away into the life of the sexy, down-to-earth characterTylowe Dandridge. He faces his share of consequences, andonce he meets the sultry, classy, yet mysterious Meeah the two generate sparksthat explode into page turning passion.Alvin Lloyd Alexander Horn manages to create believable excitingCharacters, as well as fuse in some of his provoking-steamy poetic appeal.So glad I got a chance to read this one!"
5,A MUST READ,"As I have expressed already to you Alvin, Your words captivated me. the day the book came is the day I finished it. It was emotional and real, sensual in all the right places. The art, the expression of words and character. It had my stomach excited to know what each new page would bring. The story line was easy to find yourself in the pages as you read along.This book is a sexy, erotic, emotional love story of a man picking himself up after finding out how hard love can really effect the decision we make for our future. I loved it!"
4,Brush Strokes,"A true-page turner! I was captivated from the start. This book was written with such vivid imagination, description, and detail that I felt as if I was in the presence of Tylowe. It would be a challenge to read this book without feeling the pulse of the characters."
4,Excellent quality in a great buy,"The hardest part was finding the right place to attach the mounting screws, but once that is found the rest is easy.The only things stopping an excellent rating are -- (a) the net is a bit shallow (about 1 foot flattened) and (b) more attachment types / shank diameters would cover all situations.One can improvise on the second of the two, but overall -- great product. You won't be sorry you got it."
3,Beginner's Guide to...,"I gave this three stars only because it was a bit fluffy. Though a more substancial book would've been almost as long as the NT itself, this is sufficint for the uninitiated, for it shows how contradictory and unfair the ""Good Book"" can be. The bible's underbelly is divided into six sections: 1. people and their place in society, 2. power of the church, 3. behavior (pretty sick one here!), 4. guilt, crime, and punishment (this section is even sicker!), 5. way things ought to be, and 6. science, medicine, and the world. The only section they left out is faith and belief!I couldn't help but feel some better biblical quotes had been left out in this edition. This is especially true of topics that are a red flag for me (science, women roles, etc. - I am a female engineer). But this basic book is a good one add to your bookcase because it will remind you never to take the bible too literally."
2,Light and Fluffy - Not for the Serious Student,"This is a good first book for beginning your study of how the Bible has been used in inapproriate ways. If you are looking for in-depth study on the subject or trying to find new ideas this book will not take you there.Anyone with more than a basic understanding or knowledge of the subject will be quickly bored. This book is in the ""USA TODAY"" format - lots of graphics and bullets to keep those who have a short attention-span from abandoning it too quickly.Serious students who wish to research the Bible, its inconsistences, and its vaildity should save their money and find another title"
2,Learn the basics quickly,"If you're researching the subject to write a 5-page essay for a college or high school course, this book gets about as in-depth as you need. A very slick presentation and fast-paced writing style presents you with most of the material you need in one works cited entry, saving you from having to look at or cite encyclopedias for the same basic history lesson. Did you know the bible was used to justify slavery? Or the Inquisition? You did? Most of the historical information in the book will be common knowledge to anyone who has studied religions or history in any depth. The book explores each area not *much* more deeply than your average encyclopedia entry."
2,Quick and Dirty,"This book is a quick, shallow look at how the Bible has been used (actually misused) across the centuries. Ought to be required reading for every fundamentalist. Regrettably, it does not introduce ideas for how academics have studied and understood the Bible. In that sense the book doesn't really provide a completely accurate picture. A good, quick reminder of how positive things get twisted."
4,A Pleasant Surprise!,"""Few Options"" offers a surprising story of a man getting out prison in early middle age. Kenny Johnson gives a moving performance as a man who must remake his life for the very first time. George Pappy delivers a deft script and direction in a first commercial effort, an impressive achievement. Original music and sound are amazing. Also look for some surprises by several famous character actors performing to great effect in some key small roles."
5,Sharp and precise crime thriller,"""Few Options"" is a great crime drama that goes deep into the characters and tells an engaging story without compromising with any preconceptions about the genre. Definitely worth watching for the great performance by actor Kenny Johnson (Saving Grace) and a mature performance by Erin Daniels (L Word). The directing by novice director George Pappy is very precise and deserves the most kudos. A great indie that shows the darker side of L.A. life in the Valley."
5,Wonderful New Indie,"Few Options is a small budget film with a lot of emotional depth. Director George Pappy shows that with a good story and a powerful vision you can not only make a movie with heart but you can make it with a shoestring budget and nobody will notice the difference. I'm looking forward to what Mr. Pappy will do next. But it wasn't just the directing that made this film shine, the performances by the entire cast were wonderful. And the one that really deserves some attention is actor Kenny Johnson, who plays the lead as an ex-drug smuggler who is trying to mend his broken like. You must have seen Kenny Johnson in his numerous television performances over the years, which are always riveting, but he really spreads his wings in this role. If you are a fan of watching actors grow, take a look at his performance. It is heartfelt and real."
4,Few Options,Few Optionsvery entertaining with high intensity. great to see all the cameo's of stars i'd not seen for sometime. good to see the right thing happen along the way with some unexpected turns.
3,Great premise but not real meaty,"The premise of the book, as the title suggests, is that your marriage is for more than your enjoyment which is great and true but there isn't too much content within the pages. Some topics seem to be stretched out to make a chapter, though the principle being explained is good. The book is pretty outdated too. It's pretty clear that it was written in the 90's. Updated illustrations would help with this.Could be good book for newly weds."
2,Eh...,"I knew what I was getting into. For 4 bucks what do you expect? I thought the tip would be thinner, but its kind of big, bulky, and hard of maneuver. When I first turned it on it started smoking. I thought something was wrong with it, but it worked fine after it warmed up a bit. The tip gets dingy fast and always seems to be burning a bit too hot. It served it purpose for me...I just needed it to fix the wiring on my bass...I'm definitely going to get something better when I have a higher budget."
5,Spiritually Insightful Explorer's Guide,"This is one of the most spiritually insightful and inspirational Tarot book I've ever read. How wonderful to pick up a tarot book that doesn't forcefeed us the same basic information but takes us on a walk into the deeper hinterland of tarot. By focusing upon what makes tarot wise, we come into a different place, finding its spirit and mainspring. When we know how to treat tarot as a wise oracle, our whole manner of reading changes. Thank you, Rachel, for this wonderful inspiring book!"
2,"the longest, most pretentious sea chanty in the world","I love the first Mum album. It is genius, there is no doubt about that. Their second album was good. Some highlights, some blooper reels. This album is really quite awful. It is ridiculously monotonous in mood and ambience, and it depenends heavily on some of the band's worst musical elements, such as the singing (which is absolutely unbearable after more than a few moments), and clumsy live instruments (which are uninteresting, and poorly composed). I saw them perform in Boston a few weeks ago and had endure twenty plus minutes of crap from this album before they played anything decent. What an utter disappointment. By far, the let-down of the year."
4,The ghost album,This is by far Mum's spookiest album. This one I refer to as the 'ghost album'. I love the oceanic theme and overall haunting atmosphere. The howling winds and crashing waves evoke a profound sense of loneliness and fear. This album also features new interesting sound textures and more minimal orchestration than 'Finally...' and a lot more eerie baby-like vocals. The only disappointment is that it's only about 45mins long. I was hoping the would be at least one of those tracks which extends up to 12mins or more. I love those.The music conjures mental images of a greenish ominous sky like in 'The City Of Lost Children' and many blurred apparitions (mostly women and children).
3,Frazzled whimsy,"SMG isn't as glaringly brilliant as a few predecessors; Mum have seemingly fallen into a minor creative drought while attempting to integrate maximum organic aesthetics to their chopped-up electronica. The results can be truncated, inert or shallow in a lot of downtime, and overused Bjork-on-helium vocals often do not help either, but there are still enough fascinating fragments to pick up the pieces to an engaging album listening experience."
3,"Its pretty good, but Finally we are no one is way better","SOoooo, I got both Summer make good, and Finally we are no one, At the same time.. and I would have to say that Summer Make Good is definitely the darker sounding album of the two. but they're both good."
2,Icelands worst export,This band has great potential if it wasn't for the annoying lead singer not quite singing. Next please.
4,Truly Zen,"With its slow building ambience, old world influences pillaging a list of bizarre and ancient instruments too numerous to mention, and frail vocals, Múm has produced a truly zen CD. As epic as it is fragile, there's a touch of spaghetti-western-final-gun-battle score, over the top but in their own nice way quality to almost every track but cut with an Amelie softness. Most people's enjoyment of this band will no doubt depend on what effect the lead vocals have subjectively. To some, she may sound like a broken-winged angel pleading for God's help in line with a same Bjork dealing with Beth Gibbons' emotions, but to others she may just be a little too Elmo or Robin, Kermit's nephew, to break through to a new plane of depression and wonder. Or she could be both and that's why you like it. It's a musical yin and yang."
2,less creative,"(sorry for bad english)I discovered Mum like 4 weeks ago, and fell in love with their enchanting melodies and sounds. I couldnt stop listening Green grass of tunnel for days! And I always listened their other tracks while making art designs. Mostly my favourite tracks where the ones with the cute little girl voice, so when i heard this album had a lot of singing, I was so exited.Yes, this album is still Mum, but not as creative as their other albums. Yes, most tracks here have that weird baby singing (as I hoped for), but.. theres no enchanting melody. Most of their tracks are pretty much the same, they only differ in sounds, which are not as catchy as their other albums. There are 1-2 good tracks here tho.I hope they do much better for their next album. I hardly find good music that inspire me in these days now. I still love you Mum ;)"
2,eh...,"Okay I guess I should have listened to the warning. It's nothing like the picture, they should really fix that. I haven't had it installed yet, but it was kind of a disappointment."
1,Very Unfortunate,"Okay so i purchased this muffler for 42.99U.S. here on amazon, expecting to get a great buy here..apart from having to wait over 2 weeks for it to ship from amazon to my skybox, taking a total of 3 weeks to get to me, i had to dip in my pocket and pay over 80 U.S. for customs, and extra charges..i didnt mind this, it was very unfortunate, i was exited to see my new tip and install it on my car..BUT..on opening the box i realised the product inside looked NOTHING like the picture on amazon, and i totally dislike it..i dunno if there was some kind of mistake, because on the box itself theres a picture of what i wanted..3A racing should really do something about this cuz im totally dissatisfied, the muffler looks okay..but it just isnt what i wanted.. so if u like the picture u see there for this muffler, DONT BUY IT."
1,search it first,I receive the muffler and the muffler is not look like on the pics is way different so search it first before you buy
3,Review of Petits Freres,"If you're thinking of buying this movie, you've probably read a description of it, so I won't bother to repeat it. The stars of this movie are young people in their teens are pre-teens. The adults are not well developed, but what bad guys there are, are adults. Well, the young people do some bad things too, but not to others. I can't rate this movie very high because it's hard to remember much about it after a few months. I can't rate it very low because having seen it for the second time, it held my interest while it was going on. I saw it the second time because I bought a DVD version to replace the VHS version at my local Alliance Franaise."
1,"At 6 tabs per serving, this is a poor deal","Nowhere on the product description does it tell you that a serving size is 6 tablets! That makes this multivitamin very expensive. For comparison, I looked at the ingredients of the basic vitamins and minerals in a well-known natural grocery store brand multivitamins, which considers 2 tablets a serving. With that option, in most cases, you get as much or more (especially of B vitamins) than with Every Woman II. As for the additional ""women's formula"" supplements, you aren't getting enough to be noticeable/valuable. I take a tumeric supplement that has 500 mg in one tablet, as opposed to 12 mg in this product (in 6 tablets), which is not going to have any impact."
3,Love the Concept but 6 Tabs a Day Too Much,"I love the idea of organic vitamins derived from whole foods, but I did not realize until these vitamins arrived that in order to get one day's nutrients you need to take 6 tabs a day. So 180 tabs is really a 30 day supply. I hate taking pills so this many pills is just too much for me. Plus, these vitamins have a ""natural"" odor that I find unpleasant. So far I've had this bottle for over two months and try to choke down two tabs a day, but when I finally am finished I will look for another vitamin in a one a day formula."
3,multivitamin,Liked the concept of whole food vitamins/this product requires too many supplements per day {6}/also thought I might be having a reaction to them{sore tongue} but how would you know there are so many ingredients/ appreciate a supplement taken 2 times a day but less at a time
1,My Lighthouse that doesn't light,"It doesn't stand up for very long, if it has any light it is very, very little. I love lighthouses, but was VERY DISAPPOINTED in this. People want you to go solar, but then they sell junk I wouldn't even put my name on."
1,No Customer Service,After 8 months of use the bread pan began to leak around the rivets in the bottom. When I contacted the manufacturer they said they would send me another pan . It is one month later and I haven't received the replacement . They are saying that the part is on backorder and have no idea when it will be available. I would not buy from this manufacturer due their non existent customer service.
1,Worst bread machine I've ever used.,"I've been using bread machines for many years with great results. Recently my Sunbeam bread machine geve up the ghost and I replaced it with the Breadman since I've read positive reports about the brand. That was a mistake! In spite of varying the quantities of ingredients, the ratios, the cycle options, etc., I have yet to have the machine generate anything but a stubby, dense loaf that is not always fully mixed. If I remove the dough from the machine and let it rise in the kitchen, the bread comes out the way I expect.Perhaps the rise cycles are too short. I don't know. But I would not recommend this machine for a paperweight."
2,Suspect durability,"I bought this because I didn't see a BAD review, and the price was right. The first batch I made, using a recipe that came with the instruction manual turned out pretty tasty. Then a week later I tried another recipe. All the ingredients went in, put the pan in, set the program, then ??? The paddle started making a sqeaky noise on every turn. There was no movement from the paddle after the first minute. Took the pan out, reseated, etc. I think it's a dud."
5,Inspirational and truly a blessing for my life,"I was truly blessed by this book, I loved the encounter with Jesus the author had, I felt like I was there living it with her. It was life changing just reading those simple words.Anonymous Reader"
3,Timeless Story...... Timely Film .......,"Toni Morrison's novel about a woman's emotional, physical, sexual, and maternal struggles through the slavery of the late 19th century is one that should not be ignored-- it should be read. I applaud Oprah Winfrey for bringing this text to film. Few films, however, live up to the richness of a literary text-- particulary one as rich as Morrison's. The film is good; it is interesting; it has good acting (Danny Glover is wonderful as Paul D); it is just amazingly difficult to divorce the larger-than-life persona of OPRAH WINFREY from the character of Sethe. Had another actress portrayed Sethe in the film, it might have been an even more powerful presentation. Overall the film is good; it just could have been better."
2,Very Strange Movie,"I happened to see this movie for the 1st time over the weekend on FX, and for the most part I liked it as it stayed true to the setting/era as did the Color Purple...however, the weirdness and dark element pretty much killed it for me. Particularly when the title character finally works her way into the plot(virtually comes dragging in from out of nowhere, seemingly from the swamp in all black with bugs all over her,etc) and the way she went out(buck naked, pregnant, broad daylight, with a bunch of classical Pentecostal sisters praying her back to from whence she came...eerie). Like the Color Purple and even Roots, there was some history in the mix, however, the mysticism threw me off a little. A comparison/contrast of Beloved & Color Purple would look alot like the comparison/contrast of The Last Temptation of Christ and the Passion of the Christ. Good, but too weird, I'll pass."
2,all i can say is what did i just watch?,When i saw this in the theater it was about more then half full. by the time the movie was an hour into it about more then 3/4 of the audience had left. i thought it would get better but it just got more confusing. like other reviewers said i guess i should have read the book before seeing the movie. kimberly elise did a great job though. by the time the movie was over there were about 5 of us left in the theater and we looked at each other when we were leaving like what the heck did we just watch? maybe i should watch this again to better understand it. or read the book.
2,More insight on Beloved and less confusion of it all.,"The director ( Johnathon Demme)should of gave more history on Beloved...Her whereabouts before coming back from the dead. Also if she was returning as an young adult, she should'nt talked and acted as an three year-old.The director should've also made her and her daughters past more clearer. The movie had so much going at once, you couldn't tell the past from the present. Other than that Oprah Winfrey and Danny Glover played their parts really well. Johnathon Demme should've took notes from the director who made ""Roots''(Alexander Hayley) and Beloved probably would've been better. The movie Beloved was an two star movie and I feel the actors should recieve four stars."
2,ok,"I was in such disopointment with this movie.I saw it when it came out.I'm a huge fan of john demme. The story was boring and useless!The movie never made its point!Was it about slavery? or redemption?The flash back scenes were useless,and the end!---Lets just say I walked out of the theater before the end! The acting was good,and the cinematography was outstanding,so was the score,But the story and script was very bad."
3,"Reality scenes not necessary(rape,lynch,sexual)","8/13/01 I purchased the video out of curiosity ,since it received negative response from all who mentioned it to me(they didn't like the mixing of voodoo and the harsh reality of slavery and racism)...the occult scene, made me revisit the video several times to try to understand, and as happens with many artists' and authors' works, the more often you try to interpret the work, the more acceptable the work becomes, since you see more of the creative (scenary), actors' talents, etc. and general story content. It's not a movie that would go well in memory with just one viewing(in my opinion)."
3,Not the Novel to Adapt,"This is probably the strictest adaptation of a novel I have ever seen on screen. Yet, as much as I loved the book, this film comes close to failure for a very simple reason. The Toni Morrison novel tells a story that works very well within the art of literature. The arch of climax of the book is not a narrative one but a lyrical and literary one. Demme and Winfrey chose to tell the story in the exact same order which Morrison chose but in a film this sequence is very unfulfilling and seems to just drift and stop. While the performances were fine (except for Newton's bizarre choices for Beloved) and the film is superbly shot and scored, this problem could have only been fixed by not adapting this novel or twisting it into a different order. I have a suspicion that Oprah (as producer and approver of the script) is to blame, being too loyal to the novel and not considering what is best for drama."
3,This is Oprah !,"I bought this for my collection because I had seen it originally in the theater. The comments coming out of that showing were really negative. I had mixed reviews then, but thought I would watch it again; it is after all Oprah, and her performance in The Color Purple was wonderful. Danny Glover we just don't see enough of ever, and he shines here for sure. I didn't read the book, but in the movie there is such a deep level of darkeness and pain. Talk about Mothers guilt! It's difficult catching on to what's going on, and for someone who doesn't catch on easily, don't bother. I do recommend watching this movie, even if you have to take a break!"
1,Beloved,Worst movie I've ever had the misfortune to sit through. I was the only one of the four of us who watched it who actually stayed awake to see the whole thing....mainly because I was hoping it would make sense eventually.
2,A Beautiful Failure,"I saw Beloved when it first appeared in theaters. I had read the book, so the film was not confusing. The setting was lovely and at times the acting was brilliant, but as a whole, it was a complete failure. I suggest making the effort to read the book rather than waste three hours on a film that is at best mediocre. Those who are too lazy to discover Morrison's poetic language and beautiful characters between the covers of a book might find this film satisfactory, however, for those who have experienced Morrison's incredible voice, it only taints her novel's brilliance."
4,Give it a try,"Yes, it is confusing. Yes, it is quite long. But if you pay attention, you will be challenged, moved, and captivated by this haunting film. The acting is superb and so is the music. The story encompasses not just the physical, but the psychological horrors and impact of slavery; the currents of love that run between mothers and children (especially daughters); and what it might be like to live through some absolutely horrible and terrriftying experiences. It was thought-provoking and wonderful."
3,Fair,The first movie never arrived but I spoke to the company and they was very helpful and they rush out another movie which I did receive.
3,A Great movie hurt by bad editing,"Beloved is a hard film to rate. It is very well-acted and buitifully directed. The story is every bit as haunting and interesting as the book and it's obvious that this movie was a labor of love.Unfortunatly, the film is far too long. I know this sounds like a minor complaint but it is not. I wouldn't mind it if the film didn't drag as much but the pace is dreadfully slow. Also, like the book, the film is very dark and depressing but it seems to lack the closure that the book had. As much as the movie interested me there were many times when I longed for it to be over.Beloved is a very well-made movie that suffers from a slow pace."
1,Not a good movie,"Bizzare, long, unnecessary story...none of the characters are likeable. The only thing you care about is it getting to the end and then you wish you hadn't spent those hours of your life watching this bizarre, stupid movie."
2,Didnt do the book justice,"Oprah ruined the whole essence of the book with this movie. I was expected an oscar performance and got garbage. The book was poetic and explained the relationship between the family members, the relationship that blacks have with religion each other, slavery etc etc. The movie did not catch any of that. Most of the movie did not even make sense. I was sorely disappointed."
1,Beloved,This was and is the worst peice of trash I've ever viewed. I could only take 30 minutes of it. I recommend putting this crap in the garbage.
1,Oprah must have paid people a lot of money for the good reviews,This was the worst movie I have ever seen. I can tolerate bad movies. It takes a lot for me to pan a film but this was bad. I admit that I didn't read the book and I am sure there was a good intention to bring across the message in the book but it just doesn't work. Nothing made any sense.
5,Great movie!,It's a must watch. It's a thriller that will keep you guessing. Great cast. I'm not going to say anymore because I don't want to give it away.
3,This was a ok not great but ok,"As an African-American I am interested in movies about Black history, Black culture, and life during slavery and historical black events.As a result I purchased about a dozen DVDs on various subject matter which I am just now getting around to viewing.This DVD was of little educational value to me. However, it has a very strong performance by Oprah Winfrey. I did not know she was a actress, always thought of her as a talk show host.A good performance by Danny Glover too.Black history after slavery, struggling blacks trying to make a go of it. Some good all round value, just not very educational."
3,Too Long . . .,"This movie would have been much better if it had been much shorter. Oprah, Danny, and Thandie gave great performances and the plot was interesting. Thandie was so good as the character of Beloved that it was scary. But the movie just dragged on forever."
4,Great Film !!!! Left me Confused,I did not like this movie the first time I saw it. I decided to purchase it and give it another try. WOW!!! What a wonderful adaptation of the book. Oprah Winfery was superb! It kept me intrigued and curious to see what the outcome would be. I would suggest you purchase this movie and watch it with great concentration.
5,Absolutely Fantastic!,"For anyone who has taken the time to read and comprehend this wonderful book by Toni Morrison, I am SURE that you will be able to appreciate the close rendition of this film! I think that Oprah is a wonderful woman for making this movie and I hope that she continues to make many more movies from our African American author's, such as Toni Morrison, as they do not get nearly enough recognition for their wonderful literary contributions. The movie itself, follows the book very ideally, although time would not allot for ALL of the wonderful points but all in all, a real joy to view."
5,Incredibly haunting! Fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I found this movie to be one of the best films I have ever seen. Oprah's acting is marvelous! This movie definately has a plot unlike any I've ever seen. The beginning of the movie is not only chilling but very intriguing! Even though this movie is quite long (approx. 3 hours), it holds your attention throughout the film. This movie is a 'must see!!!'"
4,It was an extremely disturbing but great movie!,I expected a different movie but none like the one I saw. Jonathan Demme should win some award for reality. It was hard to follow until it all tied together three quarters the way through the movie it took my breath away and at some points I had to pause it so I could breath again. It was one of my favorites and one of my least favorites all in the same movie.
5,SETHE'S LIFE WAS ONE I WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH.,"At first i was cool about the dog and the other pathetic stuff that showed.Then when Sethe went through all those traumatizing situations i really became scared for her and her daughter.There are times as the movie was going on when i felt like storming out of the living room, realizing it was only a movie i'd just shrug and return to my sit.The Director and the entire crew did produce a quality movie."
2,"I love Oprah, but not this movie","First of all, I need to say that I'm a big fan of Oprah Winfrey. I've loved her ever since she starred as the wacky housekeeper on Gimme A Break.However, I just didn't care for this movie. The acting and the story are fine, but there was something missing.I'd have given this just one star, but I just can't do that to Oprah. Hers and everyone else's intentions were good, but this just isn't a great movie."
2,strange movie,"i knew this movie would be weird and kinda boring when i was about to watch it.not too boring to sit through,okay movie to watch.mostly about slavery and all that stuff"
1,miss information on how to make drinks,"this book will help no one in the bar buissnes, half the drink resepes wrong, and not spesific the people who wrote this book don't know anything about mixing drinks. and who ever gave this book 5 stars is drunk. i need to know how to reture this book."
5,By far the best martial art's fiction I have read,This is the third in the Aubry Knight trilogy and all three are excellent. The fight scenes are so well described and choregraphed that you can practically see them
1,Bootleg,"This is a burnover from the ""Columbia"" (Sony) set. ""Definitive"", a shell outfit last heard of in Iberia, uses consumer audio technology to burn over CD's assembled by other companies after the recordings have passed out of international copyright protection. The CD's are then serially produced in a boiler room operation. Documentation (in the case of the Columbia Robert Johnson set quite good) is discarded; there are different copyright laws and time limitations for printed matter, so customers who have mistakenly purchased ""Definitive"" products will receive only short middle-school style essays, frequently full of errors, inserted in the packaging.Recent Sony remasterings are over the whole quite good and their Robert Johnson set is excellent."
4,Frog On My Toe,"This CD is only worth it for Frog On My Toe because you *legally* can not get it anywhere else. It is such a beautiful song and reminds my of a lullaby. It is so beautiful. I personally do not c are much for the other songs, other than talula, but this CD has one of the best tori covers ever. I love this cover."
5,WoW,"I loved this cd. See we did a dance to this song at our school, the dance was great and everyone said that the music was just right. At a dance concert, there is always jazzy and hip hop music, but when it comes right down to songs like Talula, Little Earthquakes and London Girls, they just seem to move you some how better than any other peice of music. Its a shame that Tori Amos isn't nominated for more music awards. I thought though that they could have done without the remix, bad idea, very bad idea."
4,Bees,"Her B sides are often her most impressive. This fact is no less, maybe even specially true, for this single."
3,about that B-side!,"OK, does anyone else think 'Frog on My Toe' is simply wonderful? I've never quite figured out why I love this song so much. Perhaps it's because I laugh and smile a lot whenever I listen to it. The other B-sides are nice, but not distinctive. 'Talula' is a guilty pleasure, but most notable to me because Tori's song was featured in the blockbuster movie 'Twister.' Yup, she's on the soundtrack. Cool huh? Well, there you have it. You all know I love 'Frog on my Toe' now. Oh yeah...go ahead, laugh! That's what you'll be doing a lot of whenever you hear Tori sing the line ""There's a frog on my toe. Maybe I'll call him Jethro"" :)"
2,optical block,"I purchased a Sony KDF-42WE655 in either 2004-2005. I now have blue dots on the screen. I was told by Sony that this may be a problem with the optical block. Apparently after doing some research Sony has a problem with some of their TV's having this problem. There is also a class action suit going on as we speak. After spending about $2,000 for this tv I expected not having this type of problem. Unfortunately the warranty has run out. I will not buy another Sony television."
2,You might get a few good years out of it.,"I paid A LOT of money for this tv 4 years ago, so I expected it to last. Last it is not. The screen is slowing being covered in blue. The cause is unknown to us and to Sony and cannot be fixed, so the only suggestion Sony will give is to replace it. Which when we can no longer stand it we will do, but it will not be replaced with another Sony...ever again. Be aware that we are not the only ones with this problem in fact we've heard of much worse cases than ours with this tv. In fact Sony has actually had people purchase replacement bulbs and other stuff that does NOT fix the problem and sticks the customer with the cost of the replacement merchandise!My review on this tv...buy a different one and from another company with better customer service!"
1,"Good for about 2 years, then blotches all over the screen","My last Sony TV was a 1985 XBR which lasted until just past 2005. Thus my expectations were set when we started shopping for a new TV.The KDF-42WE655 had a beautiful picture for a little over 2 years, and then blotches began to appear. The screen is now unwatchable, and the cost to repair is about the same as buying a new TV. Avoid this TV.I am astonished that Sony would not stand behind their product for what is clearly a design defect. Sony is apparently not the company they once were. We will be looking elsewhere for a replacement."
2,"Great for the first 2 years, but then.....","This TV was great for the first two years. Other people with HDTV's often commented how much better my picture was than theirs. I loved this TV. But now, after having it 2 1/2 years, it turned itself off and the red LED flashes in bursts of 7 times. I found out that is a malfunctioning D board and is a common problem. Scheduling the service with Sony has not been fun and they say the product is on backorder and don't know when it will be in. I've found it on a website and am going to order it and hope I can get technician out. But seriously, when you spend $2300 on a TV you should not have problems with it this soon. If it were a fluke, fine, but so many people have had the problem they're running out of parts."
1,beware of blue spots,"I have the 50we655 that has small blue spots appearing to be fingerprints popping up all over the screen. For the 1st 2years and four months it was fantastic view, but now I'm told it needs an optical block which I paid 99.00 to find out through sony who said if it was road mapping or lines it would be free diagnostics and under recall for the optical block. But they said it's caused by dust on my optical block so they cannot replace it under warranty because its not scribble lines or roadmapping and it would run 1200.00 to replace. Thank God I bought the extended warranty. It's extremely disappointing to know you are a loyal sony cust. and they don't stand behind their product that we spent 3300.00 on? and the real shame it IS the recall part that IS causing the concern. Get real and replace it"
1,DO NOT BUY,I've had this TV for about 4 years now. I would give it 0 stars if Amazon would let me!!! The right side of the tv has blue streaks all over it and it is covered in blue dots all over the tv set!!! When I contacted sony about the problem i was told i could purchase the repair kit BUT it would cost anywhere from 700-1000 dollars for someone to install it for me?? I could not believe it!! The optic block went out on this tv just a few weeks after the warranty ended! DO NOT buy this product!! There is no point in me getting it fixed when i could buy another 42 in tv for under the 700 dollars it would cost to fix! I will never buy another sony tv again. Bad company that created a product with problems but refuses to fix them.
1,Terrible TV / Worse Manufacturer,"We bought the 50"" about 2 1/2 yrs ago, we loved the TV initially, but about three months ago a blue cloud appeared in the lower right corner of the screen, within two months it had spread over the majority of the right half of the screen. Sony's great customer service folks offered to fix it for ""possibly as little as $700 for parts and $300 for labor, or maybe as much as $1200 for parts and $500 for labor"". I asked if the problem had been addressed with the replacement parts, or if they were identical to the original equipment, meaning this would likely happen again in 2 to 3 years, they said they were the same.Needless to say, that piece of garbage is now sitting in the corner of my garage collecting dust. I will never in my life buy another Sony product. The only thing more disappointing than their TV was their lack of willingness to stand behind one of their supposedly top end products.Buy anything but a Sony, please."
2,Melted goo,"The TV works quite well, while it works. Two years ago the second lamp went out and Sony requested that I take it in at a professional service center for checkup as the lamps kept popping due to heat. I purchased an extra set of lamps as this started to be a trend. Last night the lamp popped again. As I was about to replace the lamp I noticed that the lamp was covered by molten plastic from the TV. Right now it needs more extensive repairs and as of this writing I do not know how much this will cost. The entire lower part of the TV inside is melted. IMHO keep looking for an other more reliable TV."
2,good picture bad lamps system,this tv is great to watch movies on or games but the problem is the lamp keeps blowing out and every year this thing blows a bulb and the bulbs arnt cheap there about 200 each and i have replace the bulb 3 times already i wouldnt recomend this tv at all.
2,Optical Assembly Problems,"After 13 months of being very satisfied with this TV we noticed blue areas on the screen that measured about 3 inch by 24 inch. We contacted Sony and after a very lengthy process they agreed to pay for parts and we paid for labor. The repair shop replaced the optical assembly ($800) while we paid the labor ($300). However, the replacement optical assembly is not color balanced. It produces a distinct redish tone on the left side and a bluish tone on the right. This was confirmed with using a Minolta CS100 Colorimeter The repair shop said that was the best they could do. Bottom line: this is a great TV when it works properly, but get an extended warranty as LCD rear projection technology does not have the reliability of a CRT. Finally consider other manufactures. Whenever we shopped for a TV, video camera, etc. we only bought Sony. However, after this experience Sony should no longer receive a free pass on quality."
4,8.5 years later still working fine...on original bulb also,"My Feb-2005 Sony 42"" 720p HDTV 14"" deep slimline is still working fine and......on its original bulb!Honestly, that HDTV must have easily over 12k hours, being 8 1/2 years old, probably closer to 15k hours.As a matter of fact, just recently, past 1-2 months or so, have I noticed it's taking slightly ""longer"" to come to full brightness.I'm not even interested in replacing the bulb in it, rather when it goes totally replace that with whatever flat panel size 47""-50"" is in the $1.5k price point.I paid $2.1k for that back then as Presidents day sale at BB, still remember that day since first HDTV, and they were so new back then.So I'm ok with that almost 9 year old Sony product longevity."
3,Blue stars and discolorations,"Unfortunately I have experienced the same problems with this sony wega after 5 years of use it developed a line of blue across the bottom of the screen. This appeared after the bad winter of 2010 when the local networks ran a continuous banner at the bottom of the screen for a week for school closings. It created an imprint of this blue streak. Over time that faded, but seemed to move up vertically across the screen over to the right side. It left a lavendar fade out in the center and as that started to move upwards to the top these stars appeared in the center - as if the streak was breaking up.So now we have a star-lit screen that really shows up when the screen goes dark upon turning the tv power off. So far the picture is alright. And replacing the lamp was done before this occurred.Sony suggests it be repaired since nothing can be done, but if everyone is right about the cause and cost, we will be looking for a new set - and not a Sony."
1,Sony's $2500 blue picture and dots TV (should recall),"I bought this TV in Dec 2005 and started to notice blue dots around the right side of the screen in 2007. In Dec 2007 the entire right side of the LCD is a blue cloud and Sony still refuses to recall the TV. I always thought Sony was the best in electronics, but after this I refuse to ever buy a Sony product again. Terrible customer service and terrible quality TV for Sony corporation. They refuse to back up their product. I guess I will watch a blue cloud Super Bowl this year on my Sony LCD TV."
1,BLUE DOTS SPREAD,"I am soooooo disappointed in this TV. The first 2 years, the television worked perfectly. We were proud of it, and the picture was gorgeous. But, after 2 years, we started seeing blue dots, and now at this point... the dots are EVERYWHERE! We have been informed that it will cost $1100 to fix it. We paid $2600 for this television, and I thought we would get more than 2 years out of it. We did not buy the extended warranty. We felt safe buying a SONY product!!! I have looked at some of the reviews on this television, and I have noticed that many others have had this same problem with the blue dots, and ironically it is all around the same time period of having the television (2 years). I think this should become some kind of class action law suit. Sony should honor fixing these faulty optical devices."
5,Shoxx!,"This album has to be one of the best in Visual-kei J-rock history. Your emotions are guaranteed to be led by every note in each song. The album has a perfect mix of romantic, mysterious, and happy atmosphere. I would recommend ""Freesia"" and ""Illness Illusion"", if you are into visual-rock. For the traditional rock fan, perhaps ""Mirror"" and ""dears"" would be the right ones for you. Nonetheless, ""Mars"" is a perfect album with 12 perfect tracks, a must-have for both the long-time or the beginner J-rock fan."
4,An excellent CD.,"Gackt's (the former vocalist of Malice Mizer) first major CD.. and it's excellent. I really liked the tracks Emu~for my dear~, Dears, Illness Illusion and many other's. Overall, it's great. All the tracks are wonderful."
4,"Dry reading, but intelligent","I used this book as a text for a history course at UC Riverside. The author unrolls his opinion eloquently in this book. Readers will gain a comprehensive history of Western Europe after WWII and its turn to social democracy. Urwin's chapters include topics of treaties, the EEC, and the dozens and dozens of economic and political arrangements; Europe is moving towards economic and political integration. Urwin would not suggest a United States of Europe, but a Union where the European members no longer swindle, cheat, war, or contest one another for supreme power. And Urwin does well showing the USA has competition to be reckoned with."
5,More than I ever expected,"India has always been on my wish list of places to go and this is the year for me! I have bought several guidebooks and THIS travel CD is definitely the way to go. Not only was it full of detailed pictures and descriptions of Agra's vast history and architecture, but it was so much more than I ever expected. The travel tips, useful words, phrases, and FAQ were an added bonus. What really brought things to life was the video. The video flowed so smoothly with the musical sound, giving it a local flair. It really made me feel like my trip is much closer to reality than I ever imagined."
3,"An odd film, but entertaining.","The idea is bizarre, a child driving around the countryside trying to win a game by collecting cards with letters on them while filling his gastank. (If they gave cards out for every dollar you spent these days, we'd all be winners in a week!) Needless to say, he went through some odd moments to get all of his cards gathered...it's a quirky film, but holds your attention, because of it's oddities."
2,A different type of film.,"This movie is one of those ""just for entertainment"" category films. The plot is simple and the story is sort of interesting. Well, it was interesting to me. I'm sure that lots of folks will think it's goofy. Watch it if you have nothing better to do."
1,What the Hell?,"Okay, so the kid is getting the letter. No one notices he is 10, gets the R, blah blah blah. The reason this movie is abysmal is the ending. What in God's name were they thinking? He gets ""motorama"" and tries to claim his prise, but there is none; and after being thrown out of a sckyscraper what does our protaginst do? He hitchhikes back to the first gas station and takes the attendent job, fills up the car of a man who won 1 million dollars..the man is hit by a truck.. Credits roll after he has a meaningless 3(short)sentence conversation with the owner......and that's all. I feel the need to repeate, What in God's name were they thinking?"
4,Motorama : B-Movie with allstar cast,"Motorama is about 10 year old Gus who steals a car , and runs away from home collecting Motorama cards , if he collects them all he wins 500,000,000 $. Gus is played by Jordan Christopher Michael. the film also features special appearances by Jack Nance as a crazy hotel assistant, Meat Loaf (spectacular singer) as a biker who makes his living by armwrestling for money,Drew Barrymore as a Dream Girl , Flea (Red Hot Chili Peppers) as a busboy with a couple of loose screws ,Garrett Morris & Micheal J. Polliard as auto-Mechanics.also featuring music by Andy Summers and songs by Range Wars.Not suitable for children due to swearing , brief nudity , & Brief violence. Although the movie is kind of slow moving overall , it is pretty fun to watch out for cameos by some well known actors and singer/actors. it's pretty good"
4,excellent calendar but odd-looking hobbits,"This is a nice-sized calendar, approximately 12 inches square, with a large picture on each of the top panels. The images are wonderful (particularly the Ents and Minas Morgul), but the hobbits look too devilish.Each lower panel has the month grid, with smallish squares, a text excerpt to accompany the picture, with the chapter from The Two Towers identified, and a small, incomplete version of the main picture. US and Canadian holidays are shown, as are phases of the moon, Daylight Savings Time and dates associated with Tolkien -- his birth and death, and publication dates of his works.There is also a two-page centerfold painting of the Ents attacking Isengard which is very nice indeed.I'd give this calendar five stars but IMHO the test of any Tolkien calendar (and I've been getting them for over two decades) is the depiction of the hobbits, and these, unfortunately, are not good."
4,glasses,"packaging was great, arrived in perfect condition and glasses were as pretty as the picture can not wait to use them this weekend"
5,Wonderful....,"This is a great soundtrack. I think it is better than the Ocarina of Time soundtrack, but that is just my opinion. This has a celtic feel. Koji Kondo, once again, made a masterpiece of a Zelda soundtrack. Even if you didn't play the game, I suggest getting this soundtrack."
4,How to read Egyptian Hieroglyphics,Excellent work book to begin the transliteration of Egyptian Hieroglyphics. Each chapter progresses onwards on knowledge and there are exercises to help practice this language. You will only achieve a basic understanding of this topic but this book is a valuable place to start.
5,Great book to begin reading Ancient Egyptian writings,"This book, with practice, will really allow you to start understanding the ancient Egyptian picture writing. I was so shocked when I was starting to see those funny little images as words. A Rosetta stone for students is how I think of this great book. It's defintively a beginner book but what a beginner book."
1,Egyptian Hieroglyphs,"What are hieroglyphs?Well there pictures that egyptians wrote.All hieroglypheks are pictures,and sometimes the pictures are a word insted of a letter.Hores's eye is a very importent simble,because it is the eye of a god named Hores.He has the head of a falken.THE END..."
5,Exactly what I wanted.,"I do not know a lot about hieroglyphics beyond touring Egypt 3 times, which is why I purchased this book. But I can tell you that it is very detailed and easy to read. I'm very happy with this purchase."
5,An Excellent Introduction to Heiroglyphics,"This was a terrific book which I would advise to any beginners, serious or otherwise. It gives a good, solid introduction to deciphering heiroglyphics. Anyone can benefit from it, and anyone who is seriously interested can use it as a jumping off point to more difficult studies. Definitely a great book. ENJOY!"
4,How To Read Egyptian ( Step by Step ),"This is a very interesting book, After the first chapter I was able to piece together my first hieroglyphics. It was Amazing!!! This book is like going to a classroom, each chapter advances you to a different level of reading Hieroglyphics. If you like Ancient Egypt, And want to understand more ...Then this is the book for you."
1,Not For Me,"Quite honestly, I'm not really one to enjoy compilations of short stories--I tend to avoid them in the classroom and I rarely read them for fun because I don't care for them. Needless to say, I really didn't care for this book. The short stories weren't interesting to me, and I personally found a majority of them inappropriate. Perhaps I'm old fashioned, but I don't think that every story needs references to sex or cussing to validate it, and I find myself becoming uncomfortable when I read stories like these.These stories were frustrating to me in that many of them just seem to end with no conclusion. They read in the same fashion as Flannery O'Conner, and as I wasn't a fan of her writing either, it makes sense that these short stories also wouldn't be for me. I do understand the premise for these short stories as Jones is writing what he knows, but I personally need something much more upbeat. One star."
3,Not as good as his book on slavery,Still he is a good writer. I will read his next books. He is extremely readable. Will be watching for his next book.
3,Are they even still around?,"This is actually a pretty good product. I bought it over a year ago for my AT&T; Tilt at a good price. It was easy to install and easy to use. The maps were a little out of date but the company promised a new version with new maps on their website. There were a lot of feature requests on the website that were to be included in the next update. The website with its promises are unchanged in over a year and I suspect it may have been unchanged for a year before that.Pro: It works without having to have a constant internet connectionCon: See aboveToo bad, because it had a lot of potential."
1,Doo not buy - please read,"Have had this for over a year. Have used it only 10-15 times - spent most of the time debugging / getting thinge to work. Peeves:(a) outdated maps(b) Repeatedly locks up with Axim x51v(c) Infogation website boasts ""award winning"" -- try googling and you will see this is a ogus claim(d) their website claims v4. Again, google it and you will realise this is v1 - branded as v4. If you use the software, you will see that if this is v4, they must be very very poor developers as most companies get things right by v3.(e) A year ago, their support (responsive in autoreplies but useless in solving real issues) e-mailed me saying new release will be in a few weeks. It has been a 11 months now.I tend to give very reasonable reviews but this company stinks. Please try things really well before you buy. Or, stick with known brands like Garmin. I thought I was saving bucks last year when the $200 gps+software package was on black fri for $100 - ended up wasting $100.Cheers!"
4,TAG Heuer 2000 Aquaracer (blue face),"This is the first TAG watch I have owned. I have relatively small wrists and I worried it might be too large. It isn't. The blue face is very easy to read because the hands contrast, and the face color is deep enough so that it still looks fine with suits and business attire."
2,Partially satisfied,Great watch. Conspicuously absent international warranty card. No certification of authenticity. A jeweler said it was real or a very good copy. Guess I'll never know 100% either way
5,"11.5 Yrs, Lots of Abuse & Still Going Strong","Got this watch when we got married and I've been happy with it for every minute. I haven't been gentle with it, beating up the band, clasp and fogging the inside of the bezel once (in only 2 ft of water!) but it still looks and works like new. Three batteries in these 11.5 years and a quick dry out from a TAG tech at Borsheim's in Omaha is all it's needed. My company has offered me a choice of, among other things, two very nice watches for my 20 year gift. Not really interested in either one because my TAG can't be beat!"
1,why did they change this from 100% boar - it now is awful,"i have used this brush for years and had two of them - one broke - tried to buy a new one from my beauty supply store - brought it home and saw that half the brush was these fake vinly ""polypin"" crappy things that pull and break your hair - the same brush with all boar bristles was perfect - this is probably a cheaper way to make it but itis awful and damages your hair."
2,Unclear if it's not what I expected or if item was defective,"The quality of image from this camera was way below my expectations and what I've seen from equivelant SWAN models. The manufacturer first said the spots I saw were common to CMOS camera's, but after discussing them they said it is defective. Either way I couldn't spend any more time and per the manufacturers suggestion I'll be trying a CCD version, although more expensive, the image quality is much better (I have a B&W CCD and am very pleased)."
2,C GRADE METAL,"Most of the cliche's that pervade HEAVY METAL / HAIR METAL etc. are in heavy use here. C grade material / B grade guitarist and singer. Nothing that you havn't heard before and mostly done heaps better than this. If you have the 2340 better metal cd's out there, than by all means buy this. If you havn't, there are thousands of better offerings in this genre."
5,great old times,guy's this is the bollock's ! a beautiful album first heard in the 70's . i was involved in west end theatre at the time and all the muso's were blown away !!!
3,Not enough bubbles,"You need to pour in a lot of the Confetti bubble in order to get the desired result, as a result, I think it was quite a waste."
5,Awesome calendar,"Love this calendar! I remember most of these comics, some I don't but either way the comments at the bottom of each page make it a blast!"
1,What I got in the mail was nothing like what I ordered.,What I got in the mail was nothing like what I ordered. This thing is a piece of junk. You might as well keep the stock muffler on your car. That's exactly what this thing does; muffle like a stock muffler. Save your money. Don't waste it on this stuff.
2,Starter book,This item arrived quickly and in good condition. This book is for someone starting AutoCAD. You will quickly get past its usefulness.
5,Well Deserved Five Stars,"I used Parts I and II of the One Step at a Time eBooks to learn AutoCAD and was impressed with the books. Each topic begins with a brief explanation and is followed by easy to follow step by step demonstrations/instructions. Some more difficult topics (like the apparently new ""block"" tools) I doubt I could have mastered without the step by step approach, but this text made even the difficult manageable (it made the easy downright fun!).I'm not an easy student, but the author made me feel like one.A five star recommendation is well deserved and gladly given!"
2,Wasn't a fan,"I was disappointed with this movie. The first movie was so good and the music was excellent. The saying, ""some things are better left unsaid,"" is true with this sequel. I think by creating this sequel, it ruined the magic of the first movie. I felt I was better off not knowing what happened after the first movie. This movie was just a waste of the $2 I spent renting it. I love Disney movies but I don't think they should keep coming out with sequels if they are going to be this bad. I don't understand what happened to John Smith!!!! They forced a new romance with the other John that just made the movie uncomfortable. I also felt like the entire movie made Pocahontas look bad. She was portrayed as a savage, dumb, and a bit flighty. Don't get this movie. Rent it if you absolutely must see it."
1,I sent it back.,"Was very disappointed, it did not work.. Waste of time and money. Would never order used movies again. Hope I receive a credit."
4,Clearly for remix or club enthusists,"""In the springtime of his voodoo"" is an interesting song in itself. The remixes do it no harm. In fact, I rather enjoyed them. The short ""Hasbrouck Heights "" mix is really not all that bad, and the longer one is perfectly acceptable for club music, and prefferable to others that just keep drilling the same beat into your head.The standout is the ""Quiet Mix"", which may completely rid itself of the beloved piano, but it really is a stunning remix, not at all clubesque.Tori loses some steam with the ""Sugar Dub"", which samples the intro that Tori used for the ""Hey Jupiter"" single ""Sugar"" performance. It's a nice change of pace for an intro to a completely different song's remix, but there's almost no singing after the intro. It's barely even a DUB. No matter, because in total, it's great for those who like Tori's music and like remixes. If you don't, don't bother. It's just a nice CD. Nothing more, nothing less."
2,bland and boring......what was she thinking???????,"I love tori and have many of her cd's, but I would say, stay clear of this. The remixes are bubblegum-boring. The only good thing about this cd is the original track."
3,It's OK.,"I like the remix of the song, but I'd only advise buying this if you are a true dedicated fan of Tori Amos and are looking to add something else to your collection."
2,Standing on a Corner in MUZAKland,"In the springtime of his voodoo is a song to listen to when you feel as restless and desperate as a cat in heat but in a more celibate and poetic sorta way. it'll have you moaning unintelligible grunts that will make your neighbors wonder. But the techno remixes in my opinion are unsuccessful. They get a bit annoyingly muzak-like at times. ""And I hate elevator music.."" if you know what i mean. Definetely, DEFINETELY don't do the original version justice."
3,NOT VERY GOOD,This is the only Tori Remix CD that just doesnt do it for me...When this CD came out SPRINGTIME was my favorite song ...and the cd didn't live up to it's potential. Now a days this Cd still doesnt get played because of it's cheesy beats and light dance sounds...to sweet to have TORI's name on it.
5,Tift Merritt-Live On Austin City Limits,"This Dvd is very good.She sings and plays guitar with all her energy.Her voice has those rare qualities,of feeling her sing as well as soothing you.I'm thinking about giving it as Christmas presents this year."
5,George is Great!,"Includes Episodes: 'Night Of The Wiener Dog'; 'Movie House Monkey'; 'Say Goodnight, George'; 'Hundley's Great Escape'; 'The Big Sleepy'; 'Red Sky At Night, Monkey's Delight'; 'Curious George And The Invisible Sound' and 'Water To Ducks'.My son is 2 1/2 and LOVES George! I love that the show is educational and gets the science correct. The clips of the children using what George learned really sends the message home, fabulous!"
5,My Daughter Loves George!!,"This or any Video of the Curious George series is wonderful, my 2 year old loves every bit of every show.A++++++ for George!Hope that helps you with your purchasing decisionThanks for Reading!"
4,Few glitches but good for the money,"This printer is inexpensive and prints good color pictures. However, the replacement cartridges ... don't last too long which means this isn't the printer to get for lots of printing. Also, there are some formatting issues I have had printing from WindowsXP. This may be because microsoft does not list this printer as Windows XP compatible although Compaq claims it is."
2,cheeeesy...,"The only reason I even tried this printer is because it came bundled with the new Presario I got preloaded with XP. XP of course wanted nothing to do with the printer, and even when I did finally get everything working, I found that the image quality is noticeably poorer than my trusty old Cannon. And, as long as we're at it, it's slow... the purported 5 page per minute speed is pure fantasy if you're printing anything other than straight text."
2,A good idea but,"They look cool and easy to hook up and wire, but they keep coming loose no matter how hard I tighten the screws, the way the screw holes line up you can only use 3 on each pedal"
5,Patriotic Songs As They Should be Performed!,"I am a devotee of this genre and The Robert Shaw Chorale does each song justice. This album (note my age, it is a CD!) makes my chest swell with pride. Being a Civil War buff, I found the many songs of that conflict to be an added treat. If you appreciate this type of music you should certainly buy this record. (old guy again...CD!)"
2,"Good music, but ...","Very good music and sound, but - and this is really, really annoying - the medleys are interrupted by sudden stops between the themes obviously not part of the original recording but inserted making the CD. It's a pity, because it ruins the whole listening experience."
3,Useful but too many ads.,"I'm an international student who strongly intends to study creative writing and comparative literature. I have subscribed Poets&Writers for almost a year now. But I'm not sure I will renew. Of course, I found it very useful source to learn about writers and poets' perspectives and so on. The magazine opens up my world. Even though, i have been looking for a place to study creative writing.Definitely the magazine variously advertises many interesting schools but somehow I found it's kind of distraction, especially half of pages fulfilled with ads along with stories they provide."
3,Good Resources,"This magazine has an excellent section of up to date listing of grants and awards for writers. The only disadvantage, is that it is very focussed on the American writer - a bit more international content would be of interest."
4,"Good magazine, but the price!","As part of starting a relationship with this magazine, I subscribed to the print version, and registered at their website. No sooner had both began than I got an offer in the mail to subscribe at significantly less than the price on Amazon. Not a great way to start off.That said, it is an essential reference for writers retreats, MFA programs, grants and fellowships, which makes the still-modest price tag on Amazon worthwhile."
3,"Focused on interviews/bios/reviews, heavy on ads","Certainly, it depends on what you're looking for- this periodical is thick and comes every two months. I felt that maybe too much of its thickness came from the large number of ads, mainly ads for writing retreats, seminars, or contests. I was interested in those things, but I was more interested in instruction/tips/exercises that would help me learn about writing, and this I felt was in somewhat short supply. So I didn't renew this, and instead subscribe to ""The Writer,"" which comes monthly, includes lots of instruction/tips/exercises, as well as some ads and notices about opportunities for writers, but not as many as this publication. ""Poets & Writers"" does include some good interviews, bios, and reviews, but for my money, I favor ""The Writer."""
1,ZigZag,"Boy, Do wish I could get my money back. This book reads as though it was written by a horney fifteen year old who was getting his jollys writing dirty words, and having impure thoughts. I'm not a prude, but really! The story line wasn't that bad,though."
1,not like the product description at all,"terrible quality, not like the product description at all.The film length is incorrect.I have to return the product because it is not the exact one I want.what was worse, the dealer refuse to return my full amount of money. He did not want take any responsibility at all, even he gave a wrong product description (which lead to my incorrect purchase)I have sent Amazon.com a lot of emails to ask for help, but the result did not change.Don't buy this product. You will be 100% disappointed.Also, the dealler was not nice at all.I even would not like to give one star, if there is a ""no star"" choice."
4,ITS OK BUT NOT THE BEST AT ALL,I DONT GET IT!!? I SAW THE MASEGES AND EVERYONE IS SAYNG THE ORIGINAL IS BETER. IM FROM BRASIL AND I'VE BEEN WATCHIN SAILOR MOON SENSE I WAS 5 NOW IM 13 AND I STIL DIN'NT GET EVERITHING YET PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!IF YOU KNOW WERE CAN I FIND THE ORIGINAL MAILL ME ( THANKS )
3,"Good Queen, Bad Queen Review",This video was ok. Only ok. Wanna know why? Because the subtitled version of these videos are sooo much better than the dubbed. Did you know that Day of Destiny was actually a two-parter and the dub made it into one? Did you know that the ending of Day O Destiny isn't the WHOLE ending! It's sooo much better to just buy the Subtitled Version! Don't get me wrong I love that we can get these dubbed episodes in North America but COME ON PEOPLE! -Sailor Sun
2,sailorloser whatever,ahhhhhhh! i cant belive this totally destroyed ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! do not buy this i`m warning you it`s beyond cut version!
5,This is great!!!,"I love Sailor Moon, and this is my favorite episode of all time!!!!! I love when they find out what really happened on the moon kingdom. Everyone should get this video!!!!"
5,"I don't care what people say, its an awesome movie","Ok, this is a really good movie. I've never seen the Japenesse version and I hope I dont ever. This is really good. I just didnt like the ending. It should have added something to it. I liked the first one in this video, The Past Returns. About how queen serenity tells the story of the moon kingdon."
3,"It's Okay, but the original is better!!!","I have seen both versions, and must say, DiC you freky mess up, how could you wreck something so perfect. The original is much beeter, and the way the Scouts die makes more sense than the way they disappear in DiC. The ending song is way better than Carry On. I like You are just my Love way better. Buy the original, but if it not available to you, then go ahead and get this. Only if your desperate!!!"
3,Awfully cut to nothing :(,"The first episode is great, but the second one originally were two episodes, they were cut together to become the lenght of one. I really loved the end of the first season when I saw it in Germany, but this version makes all the emotion SM displays seem fake. AAAAAAAAARGH for what they did to it! END"
4,So Sailor Moon,I think this tape is good but the japan version is much better its 22 minutes longer because its a 2 part episode I got mine fansubbed at Mina Arnolds Fansubs they have all The sailor Moon episodes in japanesse with english subtitles. I love the end of each seaso nbecause the bad guys die and its cool but in the japan version you se all the first 5 scouts die its kind of sad and not for young children but good forkids older then 11.also recomended all sailor stars episodes avalible at Mina Arnold Fansubs holdbacks are sailor moon is nude the scouts die the new scouts sailor starlights are boys but when they transform there sex changes and they becaome girls and they use a swear alot.This series should be watched once you are 13 but it is the best season of Sailor Moon the hit tv show.
5,ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES!!!!,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE! ""The Past Returns"" tells about how Queen Serenity takes them back and shows them what it was like on the moon kingdom before Beryl attacks. It has some love scenes with Serena and Darien. ""Day Of Destiny"" tells about the Doom & Gloom Girls, who Beryl sends to destroy the Sailor Scouts. Serena beats Beryl, with the song ""Carry On"" in the backround. At the end it has the song""It's A New Day."" YOU'LL LOVE IT, I DID!"
4,Bishoujo senshi sailor moon,"I think this movie is ok. I think that the original episodes for day of destiny were better. This movie is one you should buy in subtitles. It won't seem as kiddish in the japanese version, but all in all it was a great video."
4,It was great! The highlight of the series!,"This is a tape of the 2 last episode of SM. I think these are the best episodes. I mean you have to buy all the tapes you can but...this was the best out of em all. It shows the past of the Silver Millenium in great detail, then the battle with Queen Beryl! Everyone, SM is the best show of all! You can not pass this great oppurtunity."
5,"Sailor Moon Good Queen, Bad Queen is a great episode",Well I love the Sailor Moon Episodes and this one was very exciting. I was really emotional when Darien was injured. I also felt bad when Zoisite was killed. There were so many emotions in this episode and romance and action. I think the episode was an excellent show. I also hate when people edit shows from the original version. I would love to watch the entire Sailor Moon Episodes through their entirity. I wish I could buy the whole story line of the Sailor Moon Episodes from the first to the very last.
2,I returned this CD,"sorry everyone but i think kelly wants to be Christina Aguilera, one of her songs is actually tittled the same name as one of Christina's songs,She sounds like she is screeming in some of her songs, i received this cd for Christmas and resold it. I know they share the same record label, but kelly could never be Christina, lets get that straight!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.she also tried to copy Christina's theme on her stripped CD. sorry but true.........I can't wait for Christina's CD to come out in spring of 2006, i am buying one for myself, and one for allllll of my friends."
4,Catch this metaphorical tiger by the tail and hold on,"An insane story, made up mainly of character sketches. The audio version is superior to the written format primarily due to the superior performances by the authors.You do miss out in seeing photos of Stephen Colbert in drag, however, so you may want to skim through the hardcover version the next time you're at the book store.If you're a fan of Tom Bodet or Garrison Keillor, you'll enjoy this spoof on their type of storytelling."
4,Wow.,"This is undoubtedly the strangest book I've read in a long time.I got Wigfield from the library because I love Stephen Colbert - his current show, of course, is amazing, but what I've seen of Strangers With Candy is perhaps even better. Naturally, a book written by the three talented people behind such a show sounded promising.In addition to being funny in a I-really-shouldn't-be-laughing-at-stuff-like-this way, there's also brilliant wordplay and the like, which make it even more fun to read.Not for the faint of heart, but definitely for those who enjoy somewhat reckless, completely politically incorrect (and I hate to use that phrase, because it's tossed about so much nowadays to refer to just about anything), and overall rather bizarre humor. Much like Strangers with Candy.Great book.It's kind of brilliant and terrible at the same time.I'll have to read it again."
3,It's good,"It's good, but not as funny as I thought it would be. Stephen Colbert's ""I am America and so can you"" is so much funnier."
2,"repetitive, overrated, and repetitive","I like Amy Sedaris. I like Stephen Colbert. But I don't really like this book. For such a short book, it is very repetitive. There are some laugh-out-loud sections, but the book is mostly tired jokes about strippers and rednecks."
4,Pretty funny,"This book is definitely very ""Strangers with Candy""-ish. Yes, the joke runs a little long at the end, but it's still a funny read. It's short, so you won't be tied to it for long. Overall, it's no award winner, but it is a ridiculous book from some funny authors."
4,"""It seemed like a fine night for a paniced dash.""","This is a tale which can appeal to many tastes, largely the taste of those who enjoy the authors. But there are three of them!Fans of Colbert, Dinello, or Sedaris (and, by extension fans of the Daily Show) will enjoy this tale, perfectly expressed by its authors. Rich with wit, this story carries with it the feeling of a Daily Show special report, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Sharply written and never losing its purpose, Wigfield asks many questions, and answers none.Or does it? Perhaps we were never meant to know."
5,Wigfield-Brilliant or Bomb?,"I dont know what you people are talking about. I haven't laughed at a book as much as I am currently doing with Wigfield in a very long time. This book is comedic gold. I recommend this book to anyone who wants a good laugh. ""I like watches; they're shiny. They make a ticktock sound that tickles my ears."" How can you get more funny than that? tell me"
3,Can you say Dry?,"There are a lot of good laughs and jokes in this book, but it's very dry humor - desert dry! It's very clever and it's a fun read for those who are fans of the authors and ""Strangers With Candy,"" but after a while you might find yourself a little bogged down, and wonder why you're reading something that's not really a story, but rather just a series of jokes. Reading a book takes a lot longer than watching a 30 minute TV show. That being said, I'm really glad this book was written and I like the spirit of it."
4,Crazy.,"I love ""Strangers With Candy"" so when I saw that this book was written by the same people I just had to buy it. I first got it for my best friend and he thought it was crazy but goo, so I gave it a try. Great book, CRAZY, but halarious. If you like the show then this book has the same comedy style so give it a try."
2,AudioBook...So Sad,"I LOVE all things Amy Sedaris.I LOVE all things Stephen Colbert.I need to pay more attention to Paul Dinello.I started listening to this via audio; just couldn't stick with it. For the reviewer who said the book would have been better as a skit. Nope. This is just one of those creations that isn't as successful as expected. Try again, guys. I'm always a fan and always supportive. Just can't lie about this one."
5,50000 words or your money back.,"I grew up in the town of Great Hope (adjacent to Wigfield) and remember when these events happened.

I hope the Pulitzer Prize, National Book Award and Nobel committees don't ignore him next year.(this reviewer would like to thank the fine people at Roget's Thesaurus for their assistance)"
2,It was Okay...,Kind of ok to look at for about 15 minutes. Then never open again. Boring. (and I am a fan of the authors!)
1,Read The Locklear Letters Instead!,"I just read the funniest novel ever written. Unfortunately, it's not Wigfield. It's a novel called The Locklear Letters that I picked up the same day. I expected Wigfield to be brilliantly funny based upon what I knew about its authors; it wasn't funny at all and, frankly, bored me to tears. I expected nothing of The Locklear Letters, a book that's gotten no publicity at all other than Amazon's ""breakout books"" designation, and I was treated to a laugh-out-loud comic masterpiece."
3,This could have been a great book if it had been a great book,"This is not a great book because it's not great. Let's face it. Ulysses is great. The works of Shakespeare are great. Lots of other books are great. But this book does not achieve greatness because it's not. That said, it's a good book. There are many good books and this is one of them. Fortunately, the authors found a way to synthesize their talents and render this a good book by managing to achieve what any good book achieves, and that is that it rises to the level of being a good book. So, in summary, my conclusion is that although it's a good book, it's not a great one."
1,sorta funny,"This would have been a good skit, or maybe a short story, but not an entire novel. The book is tired like the town Wigfield."
1,there's a few hours i'll never get back,"Really, I hate to use such an overused phrase as the title for my review, but coming up with something clever is really more than this book deserves. You'd think it'd be a safe bet that a book written by people you find funny and endorsed on the back cover by people you find hilarious is going to be a hoot. You'd think that, but you'd be wrong. Instead you'd be left saying, ""Jon Stewart, my man, you liked this? Seriously? Are you high? No, wait don't answer that, it's all becoming abundantly clear to me now."""
1,They phoned this in. Dreadful. Self-indulgent.,"The authors made a quick buck in an afternoon trading on their names. They should be ashamed of themselves. A lazy, unfunny book."
1,Just Awful,"I love David Sedaris. I like Strangers with Candy. But this is the worst book I've ever read. All of the characters are exactly the same, and the entire book is a repetition of one joke. Save yourself valuable time and money and stay far, far away from Wigfield."
2,Minor Flaws Over Time = Major Pain!,"Out of the box this watch looks and feels great. However, the zero setting, too often required, is painfully methodical, the mode change easily switches as the protruding bezel often touches my wrist and, as a result, the perpetual calendar, alarm, and chronograph are accidentally altered! After having reset the perpetual calendar for the fifth time for some reason, the date is perpetually crooked! I would not recommend this watch and am surprised by the great reviews. My assumption is that many of these reviews were written during the first week or two."
5,A lot of watch for the money,"I've had this watch for about a week. I can't believe this watch offers all of its features (alarm, chrono, perp. calendar, eco-drive, solid titanium) for such a low price.The watch is relatively lightweight and very easy to read. The band is comfortable. Due to the number of features that the watch has, I spent a few minutes reading the instruction book before I adjusted anything. Once you figure out how to adjust things, it's pretty simple.If you're looking for a feature-packed watch that's attractive and stylish, consider adding this to your list of choices. Given all the features packed into this watch, it should easily sell for $100 more than the list price."
2,Cirtizen's Eco-Drive BL5250-53L,"I recently purchased this watch. It keeps excellent time, and is easy to see in low light. The dual time zone feature is very neat to have for me as I travel back and forth between two time zones.The alarm is worthless, you can barely hear it if you place right next to your ear. I wrote the Company to inquire about a potential volume increase, and in three weeks they have not even seen fit to reply to me. So much for their customer service.Lastly the rotating bezel won't budge until you lube it with silicone. It lools like this could have been done at manufacturing."
1,"titanium, eco-drive, citizen eco-drive, citizen, alarm, chronograph, ecodrive, citizen perpetual","Watch was returned, because it was sent as a new when it was obviously a used item"
3,Surprisingly thick.,"Although it has been remarked on by other reviewers, the 13mm thickness of this watch still caught me by surprise when I received it. To put this in perspective, it is thicker than the Motorola Razor cell phone!This watch is bought to replace a Seiko Kinetic, which is also quite bulky. Although the two look similar, I soon realize that Seiko and Citizen have taken very different approach in building the innards. The Kinetic has a capacitor/battery as the power source but is otherwise totally mechanical. This Citizen has an analog dial but is otherwise totally digital electronics inside, enabling it to offer a multitude of functionality.Due to the Titanium construction, this watch is also surprisingly light, my wife's first reaction being ""This is plastic?"" It is quite comfortable to wear. I will keep it."
5,No Flaws Great Watch!,This watch was easy to setup right out of the box. With the simple instructions not from the manual but the quick instructions I got this watch up and running within 10 minutes! I kept hearing the alarm wasn't loud but big deal I didn't buy this watch for that purpose if I wanted an alarm I would've gotten some cheap G shock from Casio. Nice watch and look. Some complained that it is heavy??? (got me) I would recommend this watch as its awesome. BTW I have had this watch for over 4 months now with no issues. None of the mode changes that I have read on here. Best of all no more battery changes. For the price I can't complain. It's not like its worth the price of an Omega. If that was the case then maybe just maybe I would be mad. Overall Highly Recommended!
5,quality,"This album is a breath of fresh air. With Illogic ""painting a thousand pictures"" over blueprints head-banging canvases, this is a must have(as the case with any of his work). Illogic's lines are strong poetic messages, which ultimately result with one feeling inspired, motivated, happy etc.....they may even help one find peace of mind. This wouldn't be possible though if it weren't for his amazing delivery. Blueprint really makes a statment with these beats..i love the trumpet work(or so it sounds)on ""hollow shell""...i love all but one track ( wont say so not to skew what YOU may think...which is what matters the most)but yeah, it took it a while for it to hit the shelf at my local undergound joint, as it may with yours--CAP it right away when it pops up. not much more to say other than have a wonderful time experiencing greatness. peace"
4,Good Fun,"The Big Heat was an enjoyable film with excellent performances from Glenn Ford and a very creepy Lee Marvin. This film is a classis good guy vs. bad guy film, with a steady amount of violence and suspense. Ford's Sgt. Bannion is a tough cop that is not afraid to step on toes to do the right thing. The actresses in this movie are very good, and really bring the movie to the 4 star level."
4,Excellent Ganster Movie,"This was one of the best Gangster Movies that I have seen in years. Glen Ford played the simmering Detective whose wife was murdered by a Gang Lord intent on killing Ford for his attempts to interfere in his racketering business. From start to finish the pace was electric, all the more realistic in black and white. Definetely worth a look."
4,sets the awesome tone,"This film set the tone for dozens who tried to imitate; be it Clint Eastwood, Steven Segal, et al. The timing, the sparse and direct dialogue, the brutality and violence (some off camera) are what will rivet you to the screen. Watch this to find out how all the others learned their trade."
5,A wonderful film noir,"A great Fritz Lang movie exploring the depths of big time corruption. Glenn Ford does a wonderful job, depicting a police officer who will stop at nothing to bring down mob boss Lagana and his henchmen. The scene when Gloria Grahame is burned by coffee thrown at her face is an all-time great. Glenn Ford should have been nominated for an Oscar, and I will go as far as saying he should have won one as well."
4,a bit dissapointing DVD,"I was looking forward that THE BIG HEAT will be on DVD. It's one of the best film from Fritz Lang, which almost automatically translates as one of the greatest achievement in the art of cinematic narrative.And the Academy of Motion Picture Art and Science has been working on the digital restoration of the film for years. I've seen some test footage years ago. It looked great, crisp, remarkably out of scratches or dirts.But the transfer used on this DVD does not look that great. It is a bit grany, quite a few noticeable scraches and dirts from the begining, and the contrast level is not that great either, loosing some details in the shadow areas.But neverthless, it still is a great film. strongly recommended. For instance, for future screenwriters, there's a lot to be learned about the economy of narrative, how Lang always stays always on the essencial things, keeps everything unimportant to the story out of his frames."
4,Big Drama Big Heat,"Ford plays an ""honest"" cop in this thriller directed by Fritz Lang. Alexander Scourby plays the big Lagana..This film includes another fine performance by that mystical Gloria Grahame..She is the ringer and plays her part superbly..I think Annette Benning is a modern day actress with these qualities..?Lee Marvin plays the sadistic Vince..and has reprised such characters in later films. Ford, like Dana Andrews , acts with his face also..making it all very real..CP"
4,First rate Fritz Lang film noir,"Glenn Ford stars in a straightforward tale of the dark and the light. Sgt. Dave Bannion is a family man and steady cop who's made it to the homicide squad. When another member of the police force apparently commits suicide, an investigation ensues that leads to mayhem and murder. Alexander Scourby, Gloria Grahame, Lee Marvin, Jeanette Nolan in a ghoulish Ann Coulter-like role, co-star as money corrupts and authority figures speak what their told to say (Koch brother ethics 101). A blond Carolyn ""Morticia Addams"" Jones makes a short but impactful appearance, as eye candy in the wrong place at the wrong time."
2,Fair.,"I don't know what all the fuss is about this one. Something about this is just not convincing. Glenn Ford is, frankly, not a stellar actor--and some of the other players, including the gal who plays his wife are unbelivably awful. Lee Marvin does the psycho thing well but he's barely in the movie.The DVD includes the trailer for the far better Lady From Shanghai. I'd also recommend He Walked By Night or The Naked City or anything with Robert Mitchum."
4,One of the best film noirs ever!,"The Big Heat is a brilliant film noir crime drama that I hold in very high esteem. The film is charged with electricity in this story of a honest cop trying to discover the answer to a murder, whyile being mired down by his higherups take orders from the cityy's gangboss, Lagana. Glenn Ford, Lee Marvin and Gloria Grahame (the latter being the victim of one of cinema's most memorable sadistic scenes) all give extraordinary performances. One of director Fritz Lang's best.I watched the Blu-ray tonight. The print is excellent, except I detected a few cases of haloing. Grain is defnitely present.Audio could use a boost. At times, it was very good, but at others I had to crank up the receiver.Extras included a trailer and an isolated music score. There is also a booklet that spends too many of its 8 pages doing a scene-by-scene story synopsis.A recommended, high quality film noir on Blu-ray."
5,As brutal as could be back in '53....,"Glenn Ford whoops the bad guys with a little help from Gloria Graham in this scalding Fritz Lang film noir. You can almost taste the sleaz in this one....rampant corruption....revenge....and slang as good as it gets. Twilight Time did a great job on this blu-ray...the noirs are very noir and the sound is perfect with a great oomph factor in the low end.... Gooooood stuff here. Keep the coffee hot, slob...."
5,A Great Old-Fashioned Crime-Busting Movie!,"Dave Bannion (Glenn Ford) is the hero of this gangland murder and police corruption film. He's sent to the late-night scene of an officer-suicide and is told by the officer's wife that he was depressed over health problems. A tip from the cop's mistress barmaid, says otherwise, and that he left behind a note detailing corruption. Bannion's initially inclined to ignore her, but then she's tortured and murdered. Bannion's pursuit of the case gets him suspended, and an attempt on his life results instead of the death of his wive. Bannion continues bravely on his own, and cracks the case!"
4,A Solid Noir Drama,"""The Big Heat"" (1953) is a story that investigates a police officer's suicide and the widespread corruption that it exposes.Glenn Ford plays Sgt. Bannion of a big city police force, a family man that manages to keep himself above the dirt. The story is set in the early 1950s.Lee Marvin plays the syndicate boss's lieutenant and Gloria Graham is the girl friend that is torn between the corruptible lifestyle she is leading and the goodness that is shown by Sgt. Bannion. However, when the heat is turned up, people start dying.This is a good, action-packed police drama that stands out in black and white."
5,A useful book for serious actors,"As a professional, working actor, I found this book inspiring. Whether you are a beginner, or someone who in a slump, or just someone wanting to keep her edge while waiting for the next auditon call, this book can help. There are sections on auditioning for stage, film and musical theatre...and there are definitely differences in those auditons."
5,My family enjoyed this SO much!!,"I loved this story about this artist. He never wavered in his art, no matter the obstacles he faced or the injustices he endured..... What a wonderful man. Thank goodness for the huge heart of the filmmaker, so that we would know the story of this extraordinary human being."
4,Wonderful documentary,Great way to learn about the shameful past in U.S. history--the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II and its impact on one man in particular. Will make you think differently about homeless people too.
2,fantasy..definitely,Picked this book up in our small rural ranching community's library. This is a commercial grade romantic fiction. Mostly a lust novel disguised as love. This writer has never lived on a ranch ..well at least never worked on one!. Perpetuates the idea that ranchers are rich...hah!! Lots of foreplay leading to sex thru out the book...it's a fantasy.Light weight pulp.
1,Already Orphaned Technology,"Sony has discontinued its Plasma line as it sees no future in this technology . Plasma has many well known deficiencies such as burn in, unstable at altitude, high power consumption and inability to repair and does not offer *TRUE* high def resolutions but when there were no competing technologies it was acceptable for the thin form factor and sex appeal but with the advent of LCD, DLP and newer technologies Plasma has one foot in the graveyard."
4,All come together not in different pieces.,"This Plasma T.V is marvelous. Its design with silver and black trim is amazing. 2 stereo speakers make theater in home. Remote control, 2AA batteries, an AC power cord, adapters, a warranty card, and service station list means all things come together in the box. If you want to make everyday a special day then just go and have it. I promise it will exceed your expectations."
2,HUGE Clown shoes,I ordered a size 6 and there is no way thats what I was sent. I wanted to wear them for my beach wedding and no way is that happening. They are more like a size 10.
5,Absolutely superb,"I read this book some years ago when a friend was recovering from a severe head trauma. Page after page just spoke to me, and to my friend when she read it. If you are living in this territory, of recovering from a devastating accident or deterioration in your health, you need to read this book. It is filled with deep insights and hard-won wisdom from someone who has been there before you, someone who from being a brilliant self-assured surgeon, had to rebuild his whole world including who he was."
2,A Disappointment,"This episode starts out promising with the story of a conspiracy that reaches up into the highest eschelons of the Federation, and Captain Picard's mission to investigate.As the plot unfolds, we find that the Federation is being usurped by wormlike parasites that take over high ranking officials, and it is here that the disappointment sets in. As usual the Federation is still portrayed as a utopian organization, and the first episode to hint at a dystopian future fizzles because the humans are essentially blameless, so once again the Federation is uncompromised by human fear or greed.Contrast this episode with ""Ensign Ro"" where Picard will match wits with a rogue Admiral who is acting against Federation policy. That was a much better episode that explored similiar themes."
1,Didn't last long,"Not sure what the other reviewer is actually reviewing, this is not an inner tie rod.Bought two of these to replace failed stabilizer bar links on my wife's Ford. These didn't even last two months. The next set I put on were from Moog and they're holding up great. The image for this product is a bit misleading as it does not come with zerk fittings. None are needed, but it's still misleading.This is what I got from Moog and am happy with:Moog K80066 Sway Bar Link Kit"
2,Optical Block Problem,After about 4 years now I have replaced the most expensive bulb in the world twice now. Not what I expected. Now this TV has an Optical Block probelm which means that I see a Blue Splat on the bottom right hand corner and also many tiny blue dots all over the screen. Sony acknowledges this defect and has offered to fix it or have me pick from a select list of TV's for a large discount. So be sure to call them if you have this problem.
1,The is a known issue with this TV,I bought this TV 5 1/2 years ago. It now has a blue line and spots on the screen. It turns out that this is a known problem with Sony LCD projection TVs. There was a class action lawsuit against Sony. As a result Sony will be selling me a 55 inch LCD TV for $625. Overall I am quite happy with this deal but I have to send Sony the serial number tag to get it so there is only one exchange per TV.BTW I was happy with the TV until the blue spots appeared.[...]
1,Don't buy this tv or Sony products,"We purchased this TV about 6 years ago and started having problems about 1 year after having it. We have a ""pink haze"" on the screen. My husband spoke with Sony a number of times but we did not get anywhere. Finally, this year we spoke to an authorized dealer who said there was an extended warranty due to a class action lawsuit re: the pink haze. I called Sony to check on it and NO HELP. That warranty has expired and to bad, so sad was basically what I was told. I won't be buying another Sony product. To bad for them, I am replacing that one and buying another for my kids playroom (just won't be Sony)."
4,Totally satisfied,I have owned the 42 inch version of this TV for about 6 years now and have been totally satisfied. I have 4 kids and a husband who watch TV and play video games on it contantly and I know my housekeeper keeps it on all day too. I don't think it ever gets turned off. I had to replace a bulb about 18 months after we had it but the new one has lasted about 5 years now. This has been a great TV.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TV!,"I bought this TV back in in mid-Nov '04. About a month and a half later, green and pink spots began appearing all over the television. I immediately called Sony to get it fixed. TWO MONTHS LATER, THE TV IS STILL NOT FIXED. Their repair companies have come to my house twice (I had to take time off of work) and have not fixed it. When I have tried to setup new appointments, my phone calls have not been returned.Sony's customer service is absolutely HORRIBLE. I cannot even get Sony supervisor's to return my phone calls. I will never buy a Sony product again. Spare yourself some major heartache and buy a different brand."
2,It was nice until the optical block went bad...,"I got this TV in November 2004, and now 5 years later, started seeing blue dots all over the screen. I was not aware that there was an optical block issue on this model until now... Disappointing to be sure. My extended warranty has expired last year, and I didn't purchase a new one.Just called Sony, and they would not offer any discount for a repair. I inquired about the price of the optical block (just the part, not the labor), and they quoted $562.They did offer 4 TVs at what appears to be a good discount, so now I have 14 days to decide. Not sure what to do. Here are the TVs in case anyone is interested:KDL-40VE5 $500KDL-52VE5 $875KDL-52XBR9 $1150KDL-46W5100 $700"
3,"Looked great in the store, but.....","I must admit I am only an amature when it comes to this stuff, but both myself and my son noticed that even though the picture colour and image quality were great, turn the lights out and the whole thing gets washed with internal ambient light. Try as we might, we could not get the black pitch to a suitable level. We are considering trading it in for something else. When an HD source was used, it was awesome. So, even though the set has everything we could possibly want, that one thing just annoyed me to no end."
1,received poor substitute,camera was listed as having video And audio but supplied camera was video only...no audio....picture of item clearly showed a white audio output lead but there is no audio lead from the supplied camera
4,Get the new title The Harcombe Diet,"because the dietary fats chapter has been updated.Otherwise a great book, so far as I have read, as it addresses Candida, Food Intolerance, and Hypoglycemia ...the worst is Hypoglycemia as it can develop into Type II Diabetes.If you find you are still having problems on a low carb (not no carb), no grain diet read this book...and read some of the books she recommends relating to the three above conditions, especially Hypoglycemia. Even small children can experience this and can mimic hormone deficiencies.Even caffeine can stimulate excess insulin. Huh....and I recently started drinking coffee to stay awake on the job. Apparently, there are better ways to be alert and have energy and I'll find them.Thank you Zoe."
1,Waste of time,"Poorly written, badly researched and full of inaccuracies and misconceptions.This looks like a vanity publication. Shameful to publish such rubbish."
3,comfortable and smells wonderful,"I was very pleased at how quickly this pillow arrived. The Lavender provided in a separate bag was plentiful, smelled wonderful and I opened the pillow case and poured some in. The buckwheat hulls were dust free as advertised. They were nicely packed in the pillow case providing a firm pillow. The pillow was the perfect size. I could not wait to fall asleep the night this arrived to see how well I would like it. I fell asleep with the scent of lavender surrounding me. And the pillow firmly cradeling my head. I would recommend this company and this pillow to anyone"
3,Comfortable pillow,"This is a comfortable pillow, I woke without neck or back pain, however, I was under the impression that the surface would feel cool, it does not. The pillow is smaller than what we are used to in North America, but more than big enough to provide a comfortable head support.**EDIT Jun 15 2011 I no longer use this pillow. I am needing something that is cool and supportive. So far the best I have found is a microbead pillow from one of the tv shopping channels, so this pillow is in the closet, unused for about a year now."
4,Works great once you get used to it,It took a little getting used to. You have to push it hard onto the greasefitting to get it to snap on. My old normal fitting sometimes wouldn't stayon if I didn't it on straight enough. Was really great on my father-in-law'sChevy blazer---it was obvious that the previous mechanics had nevergreased the fittings where the normal grease fittings wouldn't fit.
3,Decent....,"The actual coupler I received has a nylon (?) insert as the ramp part of the coupler and when I tried to use it on a pressed in grease fitting, it pulled the fitting out. Most likely an issue with the fitting in how it was pressed in and this would not happen with a threaded fitting. It does the job."
2,Be forewarned - this cover does not fit a 2003/2004 Boxster,"The cover is about 2 feet too short for a comfortable fit. Try the next size larger (15+ feet) for a better Boxster cover. Also, the mirror pockets do not come close to matching the Porsche frame. In all, the cover is very soft and appears to be well made. The sizing information is a disappointment."
3,Good quality product - doesn't quite fit '05 350Z,"I am pleased with the actual car cover itself. Solid quality and construction for a reasonable price. I am confident that it will protect my car's finish. However, there are just a couple of comments; the 14ft cover is a little snug for my '05 350Z - the side mirror pockets don't fit. I also have to remove the antenna before covering - I will probably install a plastic or rubber grommet to allow access even though this might invalidate the warranty."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"This is an oddball comedy. It is played completely flat, and deadpant. Otherwise, you could consider it somewhere between To Sir With Love and Welcome Back Kotter with a bit of They Call Me Bruce.Tough guy delinquents that never fight, and their class at the delinquent high school now includes a gorilla, Freddie Mercury, and a robot."
1,This is a joke!,"This product is a joke! I'm trying to fix my glass coffee table with metal leg, it says need 24 hrs to dry, I left it more than 48 hrs, it's no bond at all, I don't care they cheat me few dollars but wast my time! Don't buy it."
1,Horrible and the biggest waste of money!,"I bought this to use on my coffee table to glue a leg back to it, metal to glass. Not only did it not remotely hold, even after I tried everything (adding more glue, cleaning the surface again and re-applying it), it couldn't even hold a peg on a wooden chair in place. What a joke! This is the first negative review I've ever left for ANYTHING I've bought on Amazon. Save your money and by clear apoxy from Lowe's instead. It WILL hold, and it's cheaper."
5,Better Health with Foot Reflexology,"A must have for anyone interested in Reflexology! The perfect companion to Eunice D. Ingham's ""Stories the Feet Can Tell Thru Reflexology""."
5,The Better Byer Book,This book has been a big help to me for studying and referrence. It explains what reflexology is. It gives techniques and brakes down the symtems. It has disoreders also for the symtems. It also explain clearly where the reflexes are that you need to work.
5,Cream of the crop b-sides,"This will be kept brief, but if you were to spend your last $6.17 on any one Tori single, make this the one you buy! It's like a little mini-Tori album. ""Winter"" is lovely and heartfelt, ""The Pool"" is a transcendent acapella piece (!), ""Take To The Sky"" is the best -- a fun song that includes references to her 'Y Kant Tori Read' days (""Here I stand with this sword in my hand""), ""Sweet Dreams"" is great, performed with the band ""The Subdudes"" (and I will tell you, is the most fun to do the ""Rainn"" dance in your kitchen to...hehe), and ""Upside Down"" is gorgeous and poetic, showing Tori truly in her element. Buy this single!"
4,For Tori fans...,"This single is worth buying!! Tori regularly plays most of these b-sides live when she's touring, you DO NOT want to miss out! Upside Down and Take to the Sky are wonderful, and the hauntiing ""The Pool"" is unlike anything you've ever heard..."
5,Three of her best b-side tracks.,"The beautiful title track is taken from her solo debut album, ""Little Earthquakes."" Although marked as a limited edition, this single is pretty much readily available. It includes a hand-written lyrics booklet by Amos and some of her best b-side work. Amos herself has said that one of her biggest regrets is not including ""Upside Down"" on ""Earthquakes,"" and it is easy to see why. The song has become one of Amos's fans' favorite tracks, along with ""Sweet Dreams"" (recently re-recorded for her greatest hits collection ""Tales of a Librarian"") and a show standard on her 2003 concert tour, ""Take to the Sky."" ""The Pool"" is also quite interesting in its own right, but this single is a must-have for the aforementioned songs."
5,Winter Warms my Heart ha.. ha.. ha..,I think that this is the best single of Tori's.. Winter is an absolutely gorgeous song The Pool has a nice eerie effect to it Take to the Sky is pure brilliance Sweet Dreams is a great song and Upside Down is very pretty.. I think that every great Tori collector should have this cd.. I think that this should be a good cd for all of those who want to start collecting Tori too.. Either way it's the best..
4,A snowy evening,"This release helps to round out the voice of Little Earthquakes. It's not that I think the record is any more (or less) incomplete than her others, but rather that her style was so chaotic and formative then that it's impossible to fairly taste her younger singing and playing with just that album (the same goes for Under the Pink, less so with Boys for Pele). There's a wealth of diverse material that Tori recorded in the early and middle 90s, and this chilly disc brings the listener just a bit closer to that..."
3,Babes Galore !,"i can't say much for the special effects , but all i can say is that , "" Buy it for the Babes "".!"
1,Amazon = Terrible customer service,"My new Tag Heuer i purchased from Amazon did not keep very accurate time. Since the warranty period is only 30 days, I set my watch to the atomic clock. I noticed within days it was off and called. They said it would take about 8 weeks to get it back. I love paying $800 and have my watch less than 30 days only to send it away for 2 months.I never sent it and called back six months later after not wearing it and was told they couldn't help.Terrible customer service. BEWARE"
1,Empty tank,"Purchased locally. Installed it, and hate it. Total waste of time to install. . I need to replace it soon, and that's another spilled water cleanup.Constantly leaves the tank empty. Do not buy.Update: As other reviewers suggest, I finally tore all the leak sentry stuff off. Leaving it as an ordinary fluidmaster. Works fine now. But... just buy an ordinary one in the beginning!"
2,JUNK,"I'm a contractor and like any other company time is $$$$$$---I've installed many toilet valves. Yesterday i needed to replace a valve.I installed the Fluidmaster 400LS thinking I'd save $$$$ for the client by installing this water saving valve. I installed it the way the instruction explained it and it seemed to work fine. I left the job site and within an hour the client calls to say the toilet wasn't working. no problem, I'll go back and adjust the valve, NOT...I spent a 1/2 hour trying to adjust the valve. Finally, I went to Box store and bought a diffrent valve and know the client is happy and so am I.."
2,NOT BUILT TO LAST,"This thing seemed over-complicated to install, and a weak plastic piece for the ""LEAK SENTRY"" broke while I was installing it. Rather than deal with the hassle of uninstalling and returning the unit, I was able to remove the LEAK SENTRY device (which would have otherwise caused it not to work properly) and just use it as a regular fill valve with the addition of the roller clamp, which does works. However, I question the water savings claims.The box says ""ENGINEERED TO LAST"" but it must be just more marketing because it seems like it's just cheap plastic, especially the piece that broke off the LEAK SENTRY device... so, when installing the chain for the LEAK SENTRY device, be very careful not to pull it too hard or the little plastic piece that holds the chain will break off."
1,horrible,"I am a contractor, and not stupid - couldn't make it work. I am sure I understood how to connect the ""extra"" chain for the leak-preventing valve (I carefully, carefully reviewed and reviewed again the instructions which intially are somewhat daunting since they insist on using non-laymen terms to describe objects). But valve would not function properly (would not fill). So I tied the chain up so that the valve is deactivated. Toilet worked fine for 2 days, then, stopped filling back up. So i let chain loose, thinking that would deactivate valve. Nothing I could do would get it to consistantly fill up the toilet. Nice idea but putting in practice seems to be overly complicated."
4,Outdated?,"The only problem with this edition is that it hasn't been updated since 2002. many fine wines have come out in the succeeding years. Parker likes to focus on French wines, particularly, and not those the average person can afford. While I don't dispute his ratings, most of the wines he reviews are beyond my means to afford. His descriptions of each country and its wine making history are terrific and makes the book worth the price for the education."
3,AN ERROR OF OMISSION,"I enjoy Robert Parker's writing. Of course, that assumes that it is, in fact, Robert Parker's writing. In the Sixth Edition of his Wine Buyer's Guide, however, his assistant is responsible for much of the writing. Perhaps that accounts for the fact that the section on Burgundy fails even to mention the superstar negociant, Dominique Laurent, on whom Parker lavished almost endless praise in the Fifth Edition. I bought a copy of the recently-released Sixth Edition today, and I saw that Laurent had been dropped completely!!! Who knows how many other omissions will crop up as I read this mammoth tome? I am glad to have the book, and I expect many hours of enjoyable reading, but I certainly did not expect such an immediate disappointment."
1,Not Worth Your Money,"This wine book is not worth your money or attention. It isn't a ""Buyer's Guide,"" as most of the wines are long gone from the market. It is majorly incomplete, missing hundreds of estates, including several important ones. And worst of all, the ""information"" it contains is subjective rather than objective; promoting the authors' rather idiosyncratic (read weird) ideas about wine rather than addressing each wine's true measure - whether it gives - or will give - pleasure."
1,Very little info,"This book has very little useful information.It does not do a good job of explaining how to design a binary system or in comparing the binary system to other MLM compensation systems.The author states that he is very knowledgeable about the industry, however the content is not well thought ought and the writing is poor which destroys the credibility of the little information that is in this book."
1,A note to Large and Plus sizes,"I ordered this costume in the Med/Large size, and everything fit perfect, except for the sleeves. They were soooo small it was almost like they were on an extra small, and the company just let out the waist.Not only did it not fit right, but the shipping took longer than the 14 days for shipping, arriving ON THE DAY of my event, leaving me no time to a)return for a different size or b) coordinate another costume. I ended up cutting off the sleeves, and hemming the edges. This was no easy task as it was made out of cheap satin material much like that of ribbon.In short: spend your money elsewhere"
4,Happy Music,"Just plain fun from Tori. Nothing too deep here, but worth the investment regardless. And, being a Jim, ""Toodles, Mr. Jim"" is a personal favorite."
3,Caught A lite Sneeze=Great; 4 bonus tracks=flem,"I will be the first person to admit that I adore Tori Amos. I have all 5 of her albums, and many singles w/ bonus tracks like this one. I'm sorry, but who wants to listen to anyone sing ""This Old Man?"" Besides the fabulous ""Caught A Lite Sneeze,"" which is on ""Boys For Pele"", none of the other tracks did anything for me. ""Toodles Mr. Jim"" was kind of humorous because of what she says at the end, but what is so amusing about an account of a girl who punches the daughter of a cherry-picker named Jim, in the nose? These ""silly songs"" are simply poor, but ""Caught A Lite Sneeze"" elevates this single up to an overall average listening experience."
2,Oddities but no Treasures,"This single contains a suite of aptly titled ""Silly Songs."" If you always wondered what a Tori Amos nursery rhyme sounded like, because somehow your childhood wasn't random enough, then the planets have perfectly aligned to create this CD for you. However, for those who prefer not to spend hard earned money on curiousities that you'll probably only listen to once before you retire the disc to your CD case, then you will have no difficulty finding other worthy Tori single purchases (The ""Spark"" imports are not to be missed).The B-sides of this album are short and charming. However, the derivative tracks ""This Old Man"" and ""That's What I Like"" are too long, and the original tracks ""Graveyard"" and ""Toodles Mr. Jim"" are too short. ""Graveyard,"" in particular, could have been a beautiful album track which makes it all the sadder. The fleeting, undeveloped treasures make the single more painful to listen to than the forgettable flops."
3,Silly songs and one small gem.,"The first single from her 1996 ""Boys for Pele,"" ""Caught A Lite Sneeze"" was released before the album and gave fans a taste of what was to come. The b-sides on this single are called ""Silly Songs"" on the back cover, and for the most part, that they are. ""This Old Man,"" you guessed it, is her take on the traditional children's song, ""That's What I like Mick (The Sandwich Song)"" is a cover of the song by the British duo Chas & Dave, and ""Toodles Mr. Jim"" brings us thoughts of Amos's childhood. The stand-out track on this single, believe it or not, is ""Graveyard,"" which clocks in at less than a minute. It is a largely beautiful composition in a very small amount of time."
4,...thinking about grabbing this single are you?,"If you listened to a friend's copy of 'Boys for Pele' and discovered that 'Caught a Lite Sneeze' is the one track you couldn't possibly live without, this single is an obvious choice for you. If you're just an obsessed Toriphile like me, then you'll have to buy this just because it's Tori and you NEED everything she's ever released. If you're on middle ground and already have 'Boys for Pele,' there's no reason to snatch this up. The 'Silly Songs' that pad this release are cute and sort of funny, but nothing even a Toriphile couldn't live without. It's up to you!"
3,Fun Time with Tori,"This single is a worthwhile purchase for any Tori fan. While none of the B-sides are in the same league as classics 'Sugar', 'Honey', or 'Upside Down', a listenable, entertaining mix of songs are presented. 'This Old Man' is filtered through the Toriscope and comes out soulful and deeply meaningful. 'That's What I Like...', a cover, spotlights Tori's distinctive voice and is catchy, snappy, stream-of-consciousness - a Southern femme fatale's list of things she likes. 'Graveyard', although short, is an image of Tori singing by the grave of someone she loves. And 'Toodles Mr. Jim' is a none-too-sentimental look back on a neighbor who has recently passed away, with a bit of spontaneous narrative by Tori at the end. These are not songs to scrutinize - they are songs to listen to and enjoy, on a light-hearted level. A nice contrast to the title track."
5,Verrett Is a National Treasure,"The two tracks of these women singing Rossini and Bellini are more than worth the price of this CD! I have an extensive collection of operatic LPs and CDs and have heard many others sing all the duets on this CD. These two women do it best! If you can recall seeing Olympic ice-skater Scott Hamilton in his prime, imagine TWO perfect voices PRECISELY hitting their ""marks"" (notes) in a beautifully prancing, rapid succession the way Hamilton's feet used to do! And Diva Verrett, now about 70, is currently passing her craft on to others at U Michigan as a voice professor! I only wish that more of her recordings were available now. If you are new to bel canto singing, this is an excellent CD to begin with. If you are a more experienced listener, this CD belongs in your collection!"
3,"Historically not quite accurate, but enjoyable","I read it and had fun reading it. Enjoyed the characters involved, hated the bad men, loved the good men and didn't care about the truth concerning historical events. But afterwards I read ""Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee"" I came to love Indians and hate those ""white men"". That's what's going to happen when you read this book. The hero kills Indians as if they were old buffalos and never gets hurt and the characters development goes too fast, almost as if the author was in a hurry to finish the book or was getting out of paper. Still enjoyable, but as I said not quite accurate concerning historical events (chief Joseph of the Nez Perce died as an old man, not shot in the head)"
3,the sad truth about a nice tv,"I purchased the Philips 37"" LCD HDTV with Ambilight in 7/06 it was not heavily used or abused. Well here we are in October '07 and the monitor will not even turn on, no warning of impending doom, just stopped working. The green indicator goes on for a few moments then turns into a repeating cycle of 6 red flashes of the indicator. Worst part is it's off factory warranty and Philips customer service gave me the cold shoulder.Philips 37PF9631D 37"" LCD HDTV with Ambilight"
3,sticker nightmare,"i second the notion that philips needs to change labels immediately. i purchased my tv yesterday and i still don't have the gigantic sticker removed from the face of the tv. at this point i don't think i'll ever get it completely off. as far as the actual picture and sound, it's excellent and exactly what we were looking for. but we weren't looking for an unsightly addition to our living room in the process. if you purchase this model, i would recommend that you insist that the retailer or manufacturer remove the label before you take it home."
1,just stopped working- cost for the part to repair $900!,"Got the Phillips 37PF7320A in 2006. Never that impressed with the picture to begin with.Than one day, just wouldn't turn on. No picture, no sound, no nothing.The power light indicator comes one, followed by a pattern or red flashing lights (1-4)that repeats itself. Of course, the manufacture's warranty was expired. So paid the $100 to have a repair technician come look at it, and was told that the SA board needed to be replaced...a $900 part. So dissapointed, and will not be buying a Phillips TV ever again."
2,Six time Maine Coon Owner,"As an owner of six purebred Maine Coons, one a Grand Champion offshoot, I can attest to their attributes. As one who has attended many cat shows one of the best web sites to give a complete and accurate synopsis of the history, standard, and all you ever needed to know about Maine Coons is[..]. Judge for yourself, they have nothing to gain or loose by you knowing the facts about this phenominal breed. It will make you a top notch consumer, succiently put, of a delightful and devoted breed that is close to canine ownership without the hassle."
2,"Lots about cats, little about Maine Coons per se","As the adopted companion of an elderly but still goofy Maine Coon, I bought this little book hoping to find more about the idiosyncracies of the breed: characteristics beyond the obvious, visible ones, things that made them truly unique. Unfortunately, I read almost nothing new, and even less that was Maine Coon-specific. As another reviewer noted, it was a very quick read, and a frustrating one. The pictures are lovely, but then, so are all *my* cats."
3,misleading image,The spotting set works wonderfully but the image is deceiving. The box is not a part of what you are buying. You only get the pens in a clear plastic sleeve.
4,more color please...,"Is it humour or scathing satire? Either way you look at it, Jack knew the punch lines. A shame Mr. Levine's place in art history is overshadowed by the abstract painters. Instead of suffering through essays by a critic trying to show off his Doctorate Degree, we get Jack Levine in first person! The artist fondly recalls the Who, What and Whens behind many of his paintings. This book is an essential peek into Jack Levine's world. Even though plenty of color plates illustrate this book, i docked one star because a fav piece was black and white. But that's nit-picking a great release. Get a used copy already."
5,Fun!,"very enjoyable concert footage! I just loooove the Spice Girl's and have since '96. Mel B is my personal favorite. Anyway, the girl's are awesome and all look great. It's exciting to watch the interviews as well. I never get tired of this one."
5,English Spice,"They made history with so many great hit songs in England and in the USA... I think they're the best girl group ever, yes?Hollywd"
5,I LOVE THIS VIDEO!,"It's been a while since the time I've purchased this video and honestly, I STILL WATCH IT! The Spice Girls make this concert fun and exciting to watch, you'll just want to jump up and dance with them! You gotta get this video"
1,Story of a Glorified Terrorist,"The American public is a sucker for an underdog story. Truth be told, Che was not much more than a literate, terrorist thug. Much like Osama bin Laden, except not as charismatic. He's no different than the insurgents we see in videos coming out of Iraq. Che executed a great number of prisoners, with no trial and no mercy.It makes me sick to see American teens wearing Che t-shirts. Don't they know? Che was a murderer that hated everything about America. And now little Billy wants to buy a Che t-shirt at the mall. Gimme a break."
1,Misleading Product Page,"Although the description says it fits a STA-LUBE quart container, this pump does not fit a standard quart bottle. Additionally, the product I received did not come on a card like the photo shows; it came in a bag with a cardboard top stapled closed. The cardboard top said it fits a half-gallon and gallon container; it did not mention a quart at all."
2,disappointed,"Although this book has a lot of information, it has one really major flaw...the way in which it is organized. Many of the items are listed in the index and in the chapters under their English name, not their Indian name. Because of this, you cannot just look up an unfamiliar word, and find it's meaning. For example... if you wanted to look up the word ""jeera"", which means, cumin seed, you would not find it in the index as ""jeera"",you would have to look under the english term, ""cumin seed"". To me it seems that it is the Indian terms you would want to be looking up in most cases. The index should have included both the Indian and English term, so that you can look it up EITHER WAY. Although this book has lots of information, you would honestly be better of buying a cookbook that includes a glossary of ingredients that are listed as their INDIAN name, and you would save yourself a lot of time."
4,"Good, but horrible mistakes in the ""Hindi"" titles.","I had an extremely dim first impression of the book from the chapter titles. The book attempts to transliterate an english word into a Devnagari (Hindi) script, and fails spectacularly. Transliterating back, the word ""spices"" reads as ""syasis"", ""Canned goods"" reads as ""can thruds"" and so on. It clearly has been added as a touch of exotica, which annoys me more.This rant is only applicable to the Hindi reading section of the Indian populace, who in any case won't need this book to enter an Indian grocery store.Thank you for letting me get that off my chest. Now I can be kind to the book.I am an Indian; it seems relevant in this context since none of the other reviewers so far are. The information in this book is actually quite good, and pretty comprehensive, and for that I'd recommend the book. The indexing needs to be fixed; at the very least all the non-English words in the text should be present."
4,Young Albert Einstein,"This book on the young Albert Einstein is filled with fascinating bits of information that make the subject, young Albert, come alive. The art works exceptionally well with the story, capturing the oddity and out-of-place-ness of somebody who is radically different from those around him: in this case, because he's a genius. Still, there's something missing: we learn that Einstein excelled in math and physics, but we never enter his mind to see his thoughts. (Perhaps this isn't possible with a genius, but it leaves me feeling there's something missing in the story.) We are told that E=mc2 is the theory of relativity and then we're told that thanks to Einstein somehow we get automatic door openers, television, and space travel. There's a huge gap between those sentences, a gap that perhaps should be filled with a bit more explanation. Nevertheless, a fascinating story and a book worth reading."
3,Cliffhangers make me cry,"Considering the uncertainty of the game industry and the likelihood of sequels being murdered in their infancy, I haven't been this disappointed in the end of a game since the unfinished end of Still Life. Runaway II built so well, and got me so into the story - I was so excited to see what the final climax would be and then....it ended. With nothing more than a voiceover promise that the rest of the story was to come.I sat there with my mouth hanging open while the credits rolled, as slowly I realized the story pinnacle I'd spent 16 hours working toward was never going to happen. That's not just bad game design, that's cruel and unusual punishment. If you want to save yourself some pain - don't buy Runaway II until Runaway III comes out."
4,i love part 1 and part 2 delivers,the game is colorful and the puzzles are cool and fun...only knock is more dialoge than i liked but everything else made up for it.a must play for adventure gamers.hope they make part 3
4,"good, but similar to other FP studies","So far, I'm enjoying the First Place program and the Bible Studies. This is our second study, and while it's easy and keeps me focused on my goal of keeping Christ first place in my life, the second study is not that different from the first. They aren't real deep studies, so they're perfect for someone who's just starting a new routine of daily Bible study. Others might want to get something deeper to use alongside the First Place studies. EVfEP is a great follow up to Giving Christ First Place."
2,Christians,"I thought that the receipes in the book were ok. I haven't tried all of them. I believe I misunderstood the book itself before buying it. I thought that most of it would be receipes but it was mainly a devotional through food. Not, what I expected."
1,Piece of Junk,"The product does not do what it says it will do. Smoke goes everywhere including out the top of the cover. Over priced and over rated. I wouldn't give them a penny for it nor will I recommend it. I purchased 3 of them (yep, I was a sucker) and all 3 people these were given to have the same opinion of the product. It stinks!"
1,Useless,"Unless you want an ashtray with a light, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It does not do anything at all. Even after I lowered the top directly above the cigarette, smoke still escaped from the sides and the smoke that came from the top (yes SMOKE, not AIR) was not filtered or anything."
3,its ok,it works alright but you can still see alot of smoke comming from it but it is better than not having anything
4,This reduces a lot of smoke,I've tried a lot of 'smokeless' ashtrays and none are really smokeless. This is my 4th of this type. No filters required. Use it a few days and you will see the tar buildup on the dome. Depending on how much you use it you will need to clean that off with a rag and alchohol. I use 4 rechargeable AA batteries which makes it easy to move around. The ashtray does wear out after 3 or 4 months. Mine is on just about constantly during the day.
1,ISRAELI ........,This book was solely written from the perspective of the people of Israel. If you want to read about what the US and Israeli government would like you to think then this is the book for you. However if you are looking for a book that includes facts or information about the Arab-Israeli conflict this is not the book for you.
4,Not the Holy Grail of hair dryers but pretty good,"I have bought Solano products for years and I do think spending more for professional products pays off. My hair is extremely thick so I was hopeful that the claims of ionic dryers drying hair faster were true. I'm not sure they are--or if they are, it isn't very noticeable--but this is still a very good hair dryer. It's very light, which is nice."
4,very good but pick this second,"I agree with Anil in that I'm not so crazy about the transliterations. The Usborne ""First Thousand Words in Hebrew"" also has the transliterations but not the english. There, you are expected to figure out that a 'kolnoa' is a movie theater from the picture which not everyone will get. I guess you could look the translation up in the back but that's too advanced for kids. The Steadman/Cirker version also has no English with the picture and even worse there's no color-a big big minus to me!The Artscroll ""My Hebrew Picture Dictionary"" avoids these problems plus it includes words that are specific to Judaism such as 'Menorah' and 'Shul.' I'd start with the Artscroll dictionary but nevertheless you really can't beat over 1,500 words so this book would be my next choice."
4,FAMILY FUN,"This is a great beginner's book for children and adults alike. We are having a lot of family fun with this one. My 7-year-old and 6-year-old learned how to count to 100 (in Hebrew) in just a few weeks. If you and your family are learning Hebrew, add this book to your collection."
2,More errors than consistent data!,There are errors appearing in this book from page 23 on (Va del furor portata instead of Va dal furor portata). Index of persons is very weak and inaccurate. I really wonder who did the recensy of this book? (Shame...)
4,Works great -- but formula has changed,"This is one of the best products I have used for candida and other issues. It surprisingly amazed me at the effectiveness. I feel so much better when I take it. I do try to take breaks from it, so that the body doesn't build up an immunity to the herbs. The product has recently changed its formula. Some herbs have been increased while others have been deleted. My stomach had slight ""issues"" with the change at first but quickly adapted to the changes. I'm assuming it was because of the increase in herbs. Great product!!! I highly recommend this product over others on the market."
3,Product great - price disappointing,"I've been using this product for several years and it works great. My issue is with the price fluctuations that Amazon has. This is not the first time I've run into this issue and it's getting to the point where I'm going to stop ordering from Amazon altogether. I ordered this product in August and paid less than $15 per bottle for the 120 tablet size. I was really excited because I had been paying @ $20 elsewhere. I just went back to reorder and the price has increased up to almost $25 per bottle! Normally, Amazon is very accommodating when you contact them, but not in this case. They basically said ""Oh well"". Earlier this year, I bought a product and paid $12.99 for it. ONE MONTH later, I went to reorder and it was almost $35 for the same item! I understand price fluctuations, but this is ridiculous!"
3,no noticeable diff,I did not notice a difference. Horrible taste. Increased dossage. Still no difference. Will not purchase again. Perhaps my expectations were high. I am dissapointed.
3,Dandida cleanse,Works well but tastes like rotting grass. Large tablets are uncoated and hard to swallow.
5,Rainbow Light,This product is the best to use on canines with yeast infections. Clearing up the problem within 14 days. I recommend it to everyone and it's cheaper than going to the vet .
2,Do any Rainbow Light products work?,"I've tried Rainbow Light probiotics, candida cleanse, and digestive enzymes and none of them seemed to do anything. I don't think I will purchase any of their products any time soon."
1,What with the Hidden Sugar Dextrose and GMO's Soy Lecithin,"I was going to take these so-called Candida Cleanse product but there was hidden sugars and GMO ingredients.I suggest any person's suffering from Candida, please do not buy this product for your health and safety."
1,made the problem worse,Mayybe this was not the product for me but it seemed to make my symptoms worse. I tried to keep talking it but could not.
3,"Interesting, simple astronomy","This book traces the history of the Venus transit, which is when Venus transits between the sun and earth, thus casting the planet's shadow on the sun. Happening only every 121 years, Maor explores the lives of the many scientists that studied the Venus transit in order to come up with an estimation of the astral unit (the distance between the sun and earth...about 93 million miles), including Galileo, Hell, Copernicus, Kepler, Brahe, and more. The book is very good, and one is left marveling at astronomy and eager to the coming of the transit, but Maor is very extensive in his history at times."
5,5 stars for the film. 1 star for the DVD!,"I have loved this movie since I was but a wee lad (born in 1967). I had the record LP as a child and still have the VHS tape. It remains to this day my favorite live action Disney film and the best pirate movie to date. Sadly,this DVD is a travesty!!! The colors are good but there is still lots of work to be done on it to call it ""fully restored"". Plenty of grain remains on the print. And what's all this about no special features?!?! No 2nd disc?!?! This film is a milestone in Disney's history! Yet here it is treated as second rate! Nothing more than quick sell DVD to put on the same display self as Treasure Planet when it was being released to DVD. Now how about doing it right Disney and release this gem on Blu-ray, cleaned up real good and filled with extras. Do it like Walt was still in charge."
5,Oldie but Goodie,Enjoyable well done movie. Followed by book quite nicely. A PG movie that can be shared with the entire family.
4,Treasure island Review,"I watched this movie with my 11 year old daughter and we loved it! We thought it was a little violent, though."
2,not for young kids,I bought this for my 6 year old son who loves pirates. We didn't even finish half of it because we couldn't keep up. The dialogue was way over his head (even mine part of the time). We will keep it and try again in a few years.
4,it was good,"the product was in good shape, hardly no scuffs or scratches. It arrived sooner than expected. the movie is a disney movie but is rated pg, it says the word ass but you cant hardly understand it coming from an old pirate, lol."
2,Not nearly as good as the Charleton Heston version.,"In 1990 TNT produced an original movie starring Charleton Heston as Long John Silver. Young Jim was played by a very young Christain Bale. Why this movie has never been released on DVD is beyond me, because the Disney version is awful. It's corny, stupid and dated.Honestly, the nostalgia people have for this film is the only reason it's ranked as high as it is. Do yourself a favor and hunt down TNT's Treasure Island on VHS. It's not the best format, but it is a far superior film."
4,Treasure Island Rev.,"Disney's version is pretty damm good! I have watched both versions back to back. I will still have to give the edge to the original (1934 movie). Would highly recommend Disney's version. Edge to the pirates in original, edge to Robert Newton as Long John Silver, edge to Jackie Cooper in original movie especially in closing scene, Bobby Driscoll does a fine job but Cooper is better where it matters. Overall I am proud to have both of these movies in my collection."
1,A Classic movie treated poorly by Disney!,"One of the best live action movies in Disney history. The dvd does not even have a trailer. Nothing. It is in full screen (which is not a problem as it is its OAR) but let alone no second disc, how about putting something on the one being released? It's a shame Disney is not giving their own movies the respect they gave the Miyazaki trilogy (WOW what a set). All 3 double disc. This is a 5 star movie with a 1 star dvd presentation."
5,AVAST THERE!,"Want to see where the whole modern american pirate thing started? THIS THEN BE THE MOVIE FOR 'E MATEY! Robert Newton created the mold. Everyone who talks like a pirate, except that fancy Jack Sparrow, emulates Newton's performance in this movie, whether they know it or not. Enough said."
4,Gotta love the classics,What can you say in Disney's hey day they did it right. No if they would just release their TV show return to treasure Island series from the eighties. That I would buy.
2,Treasure Island,Hard to hear conversations. The audio needs some work. Otherwise great story. Good for families and young children to see this classic story.
2,"Incomplete, inconsistent and misleading version!","One day a mysterious person comes to stay at an inn ran by a boy and his mother. It is obvious that this stranger led a rough sea going life. What was not obvious is that events with his previous associates would eventually lead to adventure and ""Treasure Island.""The only thing in this movie that relates to the book or the other movie versions is the Title.Half of the characters are missing. Much of the dialog is missing. The whole point of the story is missing. It was not necessary for the movie as other movie versions did not do this.In an attempt to be cutesy Byron Haskin lost the mystery and the morals of Treasure Island. You definitely do not want to spend any money on this version (Bobby Driscoll)A better choice is Treasure Island (1990) Charlton Heston, Christian Bale.For that matter ""Muppets Treasure Island"" is closer to the book and the singing is better.Muppet Treasure Island - Kermit's 50th Anniversary Edition"
4,The Sonderberg Case,"The Sonderberg Case is a very thought provoking read. The post WW2 scenario is eclipsed by threads of humanity common to us all, rendering it emotionally impacting."
1,Gone through two of these. Worst Scanner I ever had,Great when it works. Worked fine for 2 months out of the box. Then it died. My system began to hang anytime I tried to use the scanner. Canon replaced my NEW Scanner with a REFURB. The refurb lasted about two weeks. It still scans. But the scans are blurry with a dark streak on one side.I've owned several scanners. Never had one fail before. Much less twice in a row.
4,Good things DO come in small packages,"I was impressed with the size and the simplicity of this scanner. The USB connection makes for an easy hook-up and one less cable to have hanging around. The scans are clean and clear (depending on your resolution settings) however I would have to agree that the scanner is not the quietest machine around but by no means loud (unless you work in a library).For the money this is a great little scanner. I had a UMAX 600S and this scanner is no worse than that one, in fact I like them both. Installs in just minutes with the included XP disk with no problems."
2,No support for OS X,"The Canon web site has been promising OS X support fro over a year, but they don't seem interested and have not responded to inquiries. Scanner is OK, but having to start Classic mode every time you use it gets old in a hurry. Mac owners beware!"
2,"Great Hardware, Really Buggy Software ..","This is my second Canon scanner, and likely my last. Had had this one less than a year and am having many problems w/ the drivers ( Im running a new DELL, Windows 2000 Pro OS ). Have re-loaded drivers it came with, gone to the Canon support page and installed latest drivers, but nothing seems to help. Running diagnostics on the scanner succeeds and feel fairly certain its not a scanner hardware issue. Have had driver expection errors all along w/ this scanner, but has goten to where it is no longer usable. I also have a Canon Elph 110, and have the same feelings about it: great hardware and design, really really buggy software drivers and applications ( this coming from a guy w/ a Master's in CS and professional Software QA Mgr )."
4,Nice Scanner for older OS,"I used this scanner along with Paperport for many years and was very happy with it. The resolution was fantastic. And ease of use cant be beat. However, after my computer crashed, I had to upgrade to Windows 7. I have Vista on my laptop. So I tried to download drivers and was told it was not compatible with either Vista or Windows 7.There may be some way to find a driver to work with them but I was unable to."
5,Great North Wilderness Adventure,"What a great story. I was fortunate to pick this up at a used book sale at my local rural Maine library. It has adventure, suspense, morals, natural science, danger, good vs. evil and even a chaste romance. What more can you ask for? They don't write 'em like this anymore!"
1,no directions,"nice packaging - however, no information. should i use a tablespoon or a half cup? don't know 'cuz there are no directions. i gave it one star because the program requires a rating -- perhaps it deserves 4 stars"
5,Smells so Wonderful!,My husband wears this cologne all the time. It smells so wonderful! It is one of my favorites that he owns. I recommend!! :)
3,Be Advised,"Although this is a truly wonderful production, the bible can hardly be less, I find the reader's ""high"" English, and somewhat Shakespearean pronunciation disquieting. Frequently it is very difficult to recognize the proper names and locations that I have become accustomed to hearing otherwise, as spoken by the reader. The concept is wonderful, but too often I am caught up in the speach, pulled away from listen to the words, which is what I really want to do. I would not purchase another of this version for myself or a gift."
3,A bit dark,"I used this, without the special primer, on a plain, metal, chrome finished license plate holder. The results have weathered just fine (it's been about 2 months), but it is quite dark and doesn't let the chrome shine. Why not just paint it with plain red then?"
5,a great book in all respects,"first off, as promised by the reseller, the book was in great condition.as for the contents of the book, it's a fantastic read if you are interested in the root of the sustainability movement. that is to say the foundations and meaning of our educational system which as critical public good, is in dire need of a re-examination."
5,Everyone should read this book!,"This is a very important book that should be read by all politicians, educators, and citizens of Earth. David Orr gives clear examples and ideas for making the radical changes we need to undo some of the damage that we have done to the planet. You will be inspired and moved if you read this book."
3,mobile,"This mobile is great. It spins, plays music and attaches to our crib easily. We turn it on to help our son go down for his naps. I think the music could be quieter. I have it on the low volume and still cover the speaker with crib bumper. When the mobile turns there is a loud clicking as little pieces slide up and down the mobile arms. It is annoying to me, but puts my son to sleep. It also last for 10+ minutes which I think is too long and I usually have to go in and turn it off.Over all I would purchase this product again."
3,"baby loves it, but could be a lot better","Pros: My baby loves watching this mobile go and listening to the music. It has black and white contrasting patterns to stimulate him & classical music, which is also good for learning. Attached easily to crib.Cons: Only has 2 volume settings, and the lowest is very loud. You have to have the music playing to have it turn, and there are only 3 choices, which I find annoying versions of composers I like, and they just repeat. No remote.Overall positive product because my 2 week old baby is fascinated by it, and thats what matters."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!,"We registered for and received this Tiny Love mobile as a baby shower gift. Almost immediately after setting it up and using it, the motor wore out. We contacted the manufacturer and they sent us another one. THAT one died almost immediately too! I think we got to use both mobiles a total of about 5 times! I don't know if the animals are too heavy for it or what, but the product just doesn't work - so don't waste your time or money."
1,Babyride,"Do not buy here! I did not receive even a confirmation by the time the order was supposed to arrive. I also got an e-mail from Amazon notifying me that they had not received confirmation from the company.I tried communicating with Babyride-leaving 2 phone messages asking them to return my call-you cannot talk to a ""real"" person, and leaving 2 e-mails asking about my order. I got no reply. Finally after ordering elsewhere and notifying Babyride that I wanted to cancel the order, I got an e-mail from them saying that my order had not shipped and would not arrive by Christmas (as promised). Once again, I told them to cancel the order since I ordered elsewhere. By the way, the item was labeled ""in stock"" when I ordered.The one I ordered elsewhere has been shipped and will be here by Christmas. Also, it was cheaper and had free shipping!"
3,"It's really, really big","This mobile is fun has a lot to stimulate a baby (a mixed blessing if you're thinking of putting it in the crib), but it's really, really big. Like a good 1/3 of the crib, and also quite tall. It really crowds the room a bit. I'm taking ours off the crib and putting it near the pack n play or something - it's just too much as it is."
4,totally engaging,This mobile mesmerizes and amuses my daughter every time she is in her crib. The fact that it is battery operated means I don't have to wind it up again every few minutes. I would definitely recommend this item.
4,Tiny Love Symphony in Motion Review,Love this mobile and my newborn loves it too. very easy to attach to crib and he loves the colors and black and white. recommend it.
4,"Good, with a few drawbacks","Overall this is an excellent mobile for keeping my son's attention and entertaining him for a few minutes at a time. I particularly like the black and white patterns, which make the mobile appropriate even for little babies who can't quite focus on shapes and colors yet.The only problem I found was that this mobile is not useful for soothing my son at all - I can't use it if I want him to go to sleep! The music's has ""low"" volume setting is still too loud to be used as naptime or bedtime background noise, and the small disks on the arms of the mobile - which slip up and down as the mobile turns - made rattling noises that really grab my son's attention."
5,The Best Baby Mobile!,"This really is the ULTIMATE baby mobile! It is big and eye catching, it plays classical music from three choices. My baby absolutely loves this mobile. He smiled at it instantly when he first saw it. I play it for him when he first wakes up and right before he goes to bed. It is battery operated, so there is no annoyingly loud wind up. It lasts 15 minutes, where as the others last maybe a minute. This is awesome, because you can entertain your baby while you get some things done! This mobile gets my baby's attention from the get go, and holds him captivated for the entire 15 minutes! Another plus, the arm of the mobile moves from side to side, so you can sweep it out of the way when it is time to sleep. Don't waste your money on a mobile that matches your bedding set, get this one, and you'll be glad that you did!!!"
1,BEWARE-HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE ON THIS PRODUCT!,"We bought this seven months ago. The mobile no longer turns and i wrote to the manufacturer for help. we were completely ignored. for two hundred dollars... you would think they would make good on their product. i bought tiny love products for my now eight year old (back when he was a baby) and had good experiences, so i thought it was a safe bet although it was expensive. But after some research, i find that apparently the quality of not just this product, but other Tiny Love products has gone way down-hill in the last few years. i guess this is why the manufacturer/seller of this product did not respond or try to help in any way. sad... i really thought it would be a great mobile. Highly suggest you pick another mobile and brand for that matter."
2,DONT BUY THIS THING,"I was so excited to see this toy on line. What a huge waste of time and money. It doesnt work, AT ALL. It looks like it has been used, there are cuts and scrapes on the product. It looks nice from the looks on the box. But it does not play the music longer than 2 seconds, and the mobile doesnt move. I think if the product worked I guess it would be great. But now I am going to have to spend my time trying to figure out how to send it back and go through that hassle. As a new Mom who has time for that?????"
3,Disappointed,The Sassy Fascination Station is described as having a remote control QUOTE:'and the remote control allows for discreet activation' but the one that I received did not. I have contacted the seller and as yet I have not had a responce.I hope this helps anyone to avoid the disappointment.
3,"Great, but a battery HOG","At 3 weeks old my baby already loves this mobile and can see the black and white stripes and recognize motion in it. The music is a great choice and isn't too loud or too soft. However, we have used it on about 5 cycles (15 minutes each) and we already need new batteries for it. That alone will cost us over $50 a year in batteries for this toy!"
5,Baby Loves it!,This mobile is the best money I've spent on a toy yet for my 2 month old. She loves it - watches it for a whole cycle and its often the only thing that will keep her occupied long enough for mommy to get dressed in the morning etc. Great toy!
3,good if it works,"Bottom line: I returned mine already.- My son like it a lot. He likes to watch it and listen to the music, but too bad it stops moving in less than 3 months.As mentioned in other reviews:- The music is too loud. I have to cover the speaker with tape.- The little moving parts make loud noise, but my son seems ok with it.- It tends to flip to the side. The base has to be perfectly level to make it stay in position.- Motion and sound turn on/off together, but it is not a big deal for me.- The reason mine stops moving is because of the way its pole connects to the base. The connection get loose overtime and cannot be fixed.- Also, the remote control is almost useless.You have to first press a button on the base to switch it to remote mode anyway."
4,Tiny Love Symphony Mobile,"I thinkthe mobile is abolutely adorable, just wish the music played for longer periods of time."
3,Too Stimulating for Bedtime,"I have had this mobile for 2 children and although they both love listening to the music (even 3 yrs on) neither liked the mobile itself and neither found it relaxing - the mobile makes loud clacking noises as the beads fall, and the music itself is very loud . . . my children turn the sound box on when they are playing (we removed the mobile section as it is a stragulation hazard once baby can sit up) but it was too stimulating for bed time. The 3 stars are more for the developmental aspect of the mobile but I think there are cheaper and more effective mobiles for relaxation."
3,"Baby loves the mobile, but you can't turn off the music!","Our son loves this mobile, but you can't turn off the music. The music is too loud, so we have taped a piece of felt over it."
1,QUIT SPINNING COMPLETELY!!!!!!!!!,"GOT IT FOR BABY SHOWER AND IT SPUN WELL FOR 4 MONTHS...RIGHT BEFORE WE TOOK IT DOWN A COUPLE WEEKS LATER, AS MY SON WAS TOO BIG FOR IT, IT STARTED STICKING INSTEAD OF TURNING. FAST FORWARD ONE YEAR LATER FOR MY DAUGHTER AND EVEN WITH BRAND NEW BATTERIES IT DOESN'T SPIN AT ALL!!!!!!!! MY HUSBAND TRIED REMOVING THE BACK COVER TO REPAIR IT AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SPECIAL TOOL BIT TO TAKE IT OFF. I'M ANNOYED BECAUSE IT'S SO CUTE BUT WORTHLESS NOW!!!BUY CHEAPER AS THIS IS TOO MUCH MONEY FOR HOW LITTLE USE YOU'LL GET OUT OF IT."
4,Great but asking price is not worth it,I had this Mobile for my first son 5 years ago and got it for 25 dollars at toys r us granted on clearance but i believe full price it was still only 42.00. I have been hunting for it since May and this is the first i've seen it however it is in no way worth 169.99 my son loved it and I wish i would have takin it out of his crib sooner because he destroyed it trying to play with the stuffed toys when he was about 7 months old. I would suggest this mobile to anyone who asked but the price being asked is beyond outragous i suggest hunt around or find a different mobile. i would be willing to pay 40 dollars for this but that also includes the shipping and handling. Remember people this is a toy your child isnt actually supposed to play with physically and isnt supposed to use after 6-7 months any one would pay that amount for a mobile that isn't even made anymore and has probably been sitting in a box for 5 years is insane
2,Buyer beware - poor customer service!!,"This worked great for about four months then the mobile stopped working. The music still works. Pretty much useless, and Tiny Love couldn't be less interested. There are other products out there, think twice before buying this one. My screaming infant in the background is testament to my frustration."
2,Needs a mute button and an on-off button in back,"I'm a first time mom and didn't check this mobile out very well. I only picked it for it's colors. In fact, it was my inspiration for my room decor. It needs a mute button, an option to stop the sliding things, and a main on-off button away from baby. I went to find these options as my new baby cried and was shocked not to find them. I finally got smart and taped the sliding things and muffled the speaker with some craft foam which only helped a little. My now three month old enjoys the mobile when he's happy, but he has yet to fall asleep with it. I will try also to break it open and disconnect the music, but I think I will have to pick a new crib toy that is for sleeping."
1,Actual item is not as described!!!,"WARNING!!! The item this company will ship you is not the item obviously described. It DOES NOT have the remote control as stated in the description, twice. They are overcharging you for the model to levels below that model. Not the Symphony In Motion Deluxe mobile with remote(w/ the blue music box), or the standard Symphony In Motion mobile(w/ the green music box), but the old version with the white music box. Conveniently the photo was not posted when I purchased this item and I trusted the description, which is innacurate. Hopefully this is some kind of mistake and the seller isn't trying to scam new/expecting parents. You can find the deluxe model for a comparable price, or the newer version of this basic model much cheaper elsewhere."
3,good for wake time,"This mobile is great for wake time-very stimulating, etc. However, it's a little large for a mobile over the bed and so darn big I think it freaked my baby out a little. i removed the overhead part and use the music box. It is great-lots of choices and plays a long time"
3,"Sound, not the music, can get irritating","The music is okay, although the baby gets tired of it before he gets tired of the moving bits. Wish it could work without the music as well. The sliding things on the top are cloth with plastic rings that slide and they make a horrid noise as they scrape along the plastic arms. Wish they were removable. I do like the music choices though, and the way the animals don't just move in a circle, but around kind of like a ferris wheel car."
2,Good Mobile but Wears out too fast,Loved this mobile as did my son. Only problem it did not last more than three months and then it stopped working.
2,I'm nostalgic for the days of VHS tapes...,"I miss VHS tapes, and the wonderful way they would jam in players, and the tapes would tangle."
2,"Wrong photo, won't replace","The Laurey 10400 is a European-style concealed face-frame hinge that works fine, but you won't find any pictures of it. The official photo, which comes directly from Laurey's catalog, is not the item I received. I wanted to replace some broken hinges by Mepla (which is out of business and was acquired by Laurey) and assumed they would be able to offer the same item, or at least close enough to work. I have posted 4 photos above which compare the old Mepla hinge I was trying to replace (which almost exactly matches the catalog picture) and the Laurey 10400 I was sent. If you are building new cabinets, take note of the differences. If you are trying to repair old cabinets, don't bother.On the plus side, the real Laurey hinges have no flimsy plastic parts like the photo would suggest, which is part of the problem with my old hinges."
3,first chapter is great,"I got this book based on the the attractiveness of the theme of being summoned to lead. In the first chapter Sweet takes apart the usual top-down vision approach to leading. I would recommend the book for the first chapter alone. Honestly, Sweet's writing is a little to metaphor-based for me to follow for too long, so I couldn't finish the book."
4,Snazaroo Zoo: A Great Book for Great Costumes,"As an amateur makeup artist and face painter, I'm always on the lookout for books with new and creative ideas for characters. This is especially true of animals. The stock characters of cat, mouse and rabbit can become rather worn out over time. The book ""Snazaroo Zoo"" fulfills this need for new ideas. Sponsored by the Snazaroo face paint company, this book contains detailed, step-by-step face painting instructions for 18 different animals. This includes the standard mammals, but adds such creatures as a turtle, an owl, a vampire bat and even a stegosaurus! In addition to the face paint hints, ""Snazaroo Zoo"" also contains costume instructions for each animal, as well as general information regarding transfering basic patterns and sewing. This large, well-photographed book would be a welcome addition to the library of face painters and parents alike."
2,halloween ideas,"Before purchasing this book, ask yourself what you're looking for: Are you looking for a face painting book with different faces and step-by-step guide, or do you just need ideas for halloween or a costume party? If its the latter, then this book is for you. It shows great detail in creating the costumes and matching the faces to go with it. This book may also be a good tool for face painters that are looking for painting ideas, getting familiar with simple designs & which basic colors to use to start painting faces. Do not make the same mistake I did because I bought this book looking for something more. Maybe you can call this a warning not a review. I just want to be helpful to those people looking for better quality face designs without so much attention to the costumes. I can find these faces online and not have to pay for it. Search cat, dalmatian, lion, tiger, panda and you'll find better ones."
4,Ahhhh,"I have been sleeping on this bed now for 2 months. It was very firm and took a good couple of weeks to break in. It is very comfortable and not at all hot as I feared. So far a thumbs up on this bed...I'm very glad I purchased this vs. a more expensive model. Oh, and the smell was very, very minimal. We let the mattress expand for a few hours and slept on it the same night."
3,A MALE OVER 60,I have been using this mattress for about a month now and I still wake up sore in places like my back at times and I wish I had a softer mattress.Since the mattress expands to such a giant size there is no way I know of to return the mattress that wouldn't cost a fortune. I recommend trying before buying.
2,didn't like it,"I have had this for 10 months and my lady and I don't like it, we felt it was hard and not very supportive on lover back. I thought it would be superior to a coil spring bed, but I found that it's not, it's just a different type of bed. So make sure you like this type of bed before you buy."
2,Help I'm sinking and can't get up,"I've had this mattress for 9 months, the first 3 months it was great but it's losing it's firmness and I'm sinking into now like an old wornout mattress. I don't recommend!!"
5,SilverRest Sleep Shop 12 Inch Memory Foam Mattress,This mattress is like sleeping on a cloud! I do't have as much pain in the mornings as I used to....super fast shipping. well packed too. didn't take as long to decompress as I had expected. I totally recommned this mattress.
4,Good Mattress on a budget,"We purchased in 2010 and we are still satisfied. I had a good pillow top spring mattress for 15 years and I have back and shoulder problems. The spring mattress cut off circulation to my arm whenever I slept on my side. I thought we would give the foam mattress a try but I really did not want to pay for the Tempur name. This mattress does not cause shoulder pain or cut off circulation. Also the kids can't bounce on it, they just sink into it! The one complaint that I have seen is odor. We have an enclosed porch and we left it out for 2 days before setting it up and the odor is insignificant. Also, it is supposed to be on a solid base not a spring base. I just built a 1/2"" plywood platform in our original bed frame (that cost us 30.00 or so) Great mattress for the money."
5,Great Alternative to Tempur-pedic,"We just couldn't see paying the excessive price of the Tempur-pedic so we thought we'd try this one. So far, we are very impressed. The initial smell of the foam, while not pleasant, was not that bad and did fade away after a few days. Also, it has a zippered cover that can be removed and washed. At first it seems very firm, but it just takes a few nights of adjusting to the ""contouring"" of the mattress, and we sleep very well now. No tossing and turning. No back aches. We would certainly recommend this mattress to others."
1,memory foam matress,"The mattress was interesting in the packaging but no problems. Some people complained about the smell, but it wasn't bad. However, it is as hard as a rock. You may as well be sleeping on the floor. Perhaps we got a lemon, but I will never buy a mattress online again. I read all the reviews and thought it was safe because everyone seemed to like this mattress. I like firm, but this is over the top--100% hard surface."
1,Unbelievable odor,"Mattress is still sitting in a room with a window fan exhausting the odor. Walking in the room is likesticking your face into a pail of paint. It is horrid. They'll let you return it for any reason, butthere is no way this thing can be wrapped for shipping - its too large and weighs 90 pounds, you'd need tohave a vacuum sealer like the manufacturer. I'm worried that this will be a 600 dollar loss. Somethingthis big will come from a furniture store next time. This was a dreadful purchase"
4,Really like it!,"My daughter has the high end competitors brand, but honestly, I like this mattress just as well....and for a fraction of the price!"
2,Not for overweight people,"This was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. The smell went away after a few months, and you start to not mind, when sleeping in comfort. Less than a year from purchase it has compressed permanently. My guess is this is a bed not designed for anyone over 250 lbs. (I am between the 250-300 lb range). Under 200 lbs. Excellent, 5 stars, the smell equates to comfort. Over 200 lbs, buyer beware and it won't last long."
5,Super Fast Delivery,We got the mattress the day before the first estimated delivery date. It inflated quickly and the smell evaporated before the first night. We get occasional whiffs but the mattress pad and sheets it is usually unnoticeable. Rolling over was really odd until having gotten used to the bed.
5,Memory foam mattress.,The mattress is great. we replaced our traditional mattress and now we sleep comfortably and through the night.
4,"Great value, good night.","This is a nice bed. Takes a few days to get used to sleeping on mem foam mattress. I flip around less but when I do, it takes more effort to get out of the depression that my body made. I was having shoulder issues as I am 220 and 6'4"" and like to sleep on my side. This mattress makes it possible. My arms don't fall asleep.The chemical smell that other reviewers mention is real and in my case it took a week before the room didn't smell. I can still smell it if I look for it. It is not offensive but it is noticeable and persistent.I am happy with the bed and the value it represents. I would buy another one."
5,no more back problems,I have tried several mattresse's and this one is trully an amazing mattress for my lower back problems. I recommend it if you wake up every morning with an aching back.
5,Most Comfortable Mattress Ever!,"I bought this mattress 11 months ago and it has truly been one of the best purchases I have ever made. I was very leery of purchasing something online that I could not lie on or feel, however, I am so glad I took a chance a bought this. I have a bad back from having had scoliosis as a child and a good mattresses makes a huge difference in how I feel the next day. I recently had to be away from home for 2 weeks on business and of all the things I missed, I think my mattress was right at the top of the list!! Would highly recommend!"
4,Just got it!,"Just got it in the other day. Packaging was great, no huge problems unpacking. It completely inflated within a few hours. There was a chemical smell but it's not too bad. We slept on it the first night. I wasn't used to the firmness (which I hear gets better) so my arms kept falling asleep whichever way I turned due to the extra compression on my nerves BUT did not have my usual back pain that I normally get with my old mattress. So far so good, I'll have to post another review in a year or so to see how it's still holding up!"
5,Perfect throughout my pregnancy,"Me and my fiance decided to buy this mattress after reading many good reviews on memory foam mattresses and in particular about this one. The price was another component that made us go for it. To remind is that I am 7 months pregnant and for me it's getting so hard to find a good position to sleep in any other type of beds. Furthermore, my fiance is 6'6 so we definitely need a mattress able to make the both of us sleep on a cloud.The mattress arrived one week after we purchase it on line and the only worry we had was the stinky smell everybody was talking about in many reviews. Ours came with a slight smell but after a day the smell was almost gone. We couldn't wait to sleep on it. We did it on the second night and the experience was marvelous. I am able to sleep 13 hours in a row on it despite my big belly and my fiance is getting the proper rest he needed.I am definitely recommending it to everybody!!!"
4,a good choice,"Like so many other reviews I've read, I labored long and hard on my decision of which memory foam mattress to purchase. I tested the tempurpedic, read the websites, etc.I'm not frugal, I simply couldn't afford the tempurpedic. The Sleep Shop mattress is, for all intensive purposes, excellent. It's admittedly not as ""soft"" as the swedes make their mattress, but it's comfortable and it alleviates back pain all the same.Yes, it smells to start out but it doesn't reek. It certainly hasn't stopped me from falling asleep.Overall, I say buy the bed, it's worth it."
4,Foam Mattress,Excellent shipping and packaging. The outside of the 1st layer of plastic is dirty so open it in the garage then bring it in the house and remove the 2nd layer. Mattress is nice but a little on the firm side. The smell went away after about 5 days. If you like a firm mattress then this one is for you.
3,"Great for bad back while sleeping but bad for sex/""relations""","I really felt someone should finally say it: you can't really have sex on these beds. I don't want to be graphic but IT IS part of human life. It feels great on your back for sleeping. If you, however, attempt to have any kind of ""relations"" on the bed-- someone ends up in a deep ""hole"" or you slide around like you're on a hockey rink.We put this in another room and bought an old spring mattress with a pillow top."
5,Wusthof Classic 6 inch knife,Got it today. It's beautiful. Just the size we need and it feels great. Packageing was a little over the top but it did arrive in perfect shape. Thanks
5,the knife i use the most...,"This is an overall excellent kitchen knife! Its a great size, not too big for easy use or storing. It is something I use almost everyday for most cutting jobs. I will say that for larger, harder veggies, like winter squash i think i could use a bigger knife...but if i had to pick one, i would pick this one. I bought a shapening tool at the same time and use it often.After every use I wash and dry it totally. Leaving these knives to drip dry (or using a dishwasher) will i think stain the blade. I do have a dark water spot or two from before i realized this.The knife is sturdy. When you are cutting, if the blade is sharp you do not feel like it will *slip* off the food your cutting. Its solid but not heavy..."
5,"Great Wüsthof quality, & a perfect size Cook's Knife for some.....","Originally I had the Wüsthof 8-Inch Cook's Knife (which came with the Wüsthof 10 pc. Classic set). Finally, I realized that the 8-Inch Cook's Knife was just too large & ""intimidating"" for me, esp. to just chop a couple of onions or bell peppers now & then. I bought the 6-Inch Cook's Knife & it's a much better size for me, my tiny 1-person-cook kitchen, & my relatively modest cooking skills.I'm a big Wüsthof fan now, & personally I'm partial to the Classic line. Oh, & I sold the 8-Inch Cook's Knife on e-bay for a very good price; it seems like Wüsthof has very good resale value as well....."
3,okay knife terrible packaging,I bought this Wustoff knife as a gift for someone who had seen mine from a specialty store and loved it. I was excited to see the much cheaper price but was disappointed when it arrived. Instead of the nice sheath that most of these knives come in this one was in a cheap box with a cellophane front. It looked like it came out of a boxed lot of knives and not like the expensive brand it is.
1,You wouldn't believe,The watch looks very nice when i opened the box the crystal was laying in the box not even on the watch
2,Unacceptable quality,"Worn only a few times after received as a Christmas present, the crystals began to fall off. I will be sending it to a Bulova repair center, paying shipping both ways."
2,Pretty but not reliable,"I purchased this watch because it is very pretty. I had it 3 months before it stopped working. I sent it back to Bulova for repair. I just got it back from Bulova and it appears to be working, but they returned it to me with a broken band. Needless to say, I am not happy with the service department at Bulova."
5,Buy this book.,"I need to buy this book in Calgary or Madrid.I would like to read in spanish,but in english is the same.Quick and ""Accurate Solutions to Your Everyday Pipe Line Problems"" by E. W. McAllister(Editor)"
4,"I'm a sailer, but......","I always forget how to make knots. This is a worthwhile book. It has enough, not quite enough, knots to make life interesting.But the best thing are the illustrations and instructions. Its hard to find a book thats more clear. especially in some of the more complicated knots. I am going to buy his sailing knot book when I have this one down."
5,Buy this book!!,"I brought this book along on the day I recently spent with the Ventura PD SWAT team. When I got the book out & showed it to the guys on the team, they were much amused to find that one of the teams profiled was the Modesto team, whom they had just beaten in the '99 California SWAT team championships, by two places. The Ventura team came in third overall out of 26 teams.All the guys who looked at the book thought the info was well-presented & pretty accurate. As a civilian, I was very much impressed with Halberstadt's writing style, the quality of the photos & the amount of detail given on just how teams operate. For someone who wants to understand how a SWAT team works, this is the book to buy.Only recommendation for the second edition is that Hans profile the Ventura team-a great bunch of guys & very professional!!"
2,"Very basic information, only for amertures & non-pros",Those who say this book is good is obviously non SWAT personnel or public with superficial understanding in SWAT tactis. The info is very surface and basic. Not much help for the professioal SWAT member. I was in the Commando Forces of my country's Armed Forces and I know what I'm talking about!
4,Almost there,"A very well written and amusing book with a number of life changing ideals contained within the pages. I have read a numbe of these books and whilst rating Geoff Burch's ""Way of the Dog"" as the premium book of this genre, McGee's fluid style of writing and ideas form a very good package. Perhaps reading the ""Way of the Dog"" together with SUMO will truly give you all you need to get to the top of the tree!"
3,"Quick read, poor format","SUMO is a fast, easy and empowering little book. Unfortunately, the Kindle version is fraught with formatting errors which put a crimp in the otherwise smooth and enjoyable read."
4,Great reference book,Great for what it is. Lots of info to decode vins in the field to make sure you're getting what you're supposed to.
5,EXCELLENT!,"To see these two mighty women burst unto the stage and sing wasa desperate treat for me! It shows (as I sing opera myself) a lot of the old school vocal techniques which are very rare in this day and age. I very much appreciate the artistry, but I also appreciate even more the relationship that these two singers have with each other, and the love and respect they share one for the other. If only we behaved like that more...(*sigh*)!"
4,Lovely though not as good as it could have been,"The DVD has what appears to be excerpts from two concerts. There are no liner notes and nothing to help provide any context for the programs. However the images are clear, the color good, the video direction non distracting and the sound adequate for a live performance DVD from the 1990s. For me the several duets were the highlight of the programs. The two voices blended beautifully and the two Diva's remained very aware of what the other was doing. Ms Caballe's rendition of O mio babino caro from Gianni Schicchi brought tears to my eyes."
5,Gorgeous,"Sinatra cared so much about this album he recorded it twice. After listening to the original sessions, he decided the keys were wrong and did everything over. This is a beautiful, heartfelt album (it's too bad the deleted song ""In The Blue of Evening"" wasn't included) but the timing on its release was out of synch and it couldn't find an audience. It has stood the test of time and is a beautiful listening experience still."
5,I Love Sinatra.,I Love Sinatra. What a wonderful collection of original Sinatra classics! Some of which are re-mastered recordings in the original arrangements
5,Vintage Sinatra,"In 1961, Frank Sinatra recorded a tribute album to late composer Tommy Dorsey who was a former collaborator with Sinatra early in his career. This album is a ragbag of nearly everything from jazzy tunes to sorrowful saloon songs to swinging, upbeat songs.This is a great time capsule of Sinatra's early Reprise years and a touching tribute to Dorsey as all the songs are renditions of songs Sinatra once recorded with Mr. Dorsey himself. The real highlights of the album are ""East of the Sun (And West of the Moon),"" ""Without a Song,"" and ""I'll Be Seeing You."" Sy Oliver arranged and conducted this album but also lent his voiced to the duet ""The One I Love (Belongs to Somebody Else)."" Mr Oliver sounds very much like Dean Martin and provides great vocal contrast to Sinatra. This is a very fine album, and any fan of Ol' Blue Eyes ought to have it in his or her collection."
3,alot of flaws mixed with some really creative budget work!!!,"first of the camera work was just fine!!for what they had to work with.as amatter of fact some of the camera work was awsome!!some very BAD!acting,and the storyline never quite stays in line.thats what is bad about the movie.this is whats good about the movie,the killer is spooky looking(with his silver mask)the direction & the camera work at times could be very good(like i said for what they had to work with)but most of all, and what all horror fans care about is the murder scenes. well there were some pretty cool one's in this low budget slasher flick!!!!!anyway i liked it,could have been much better and it could have been much worse,BUT DOESN'T THAT DEFINE B HORROR?!!! I THOUGHT SO!!!"
2,Good Plot but Bad Camera Work!!!,"This movie caught my eye in the video store. There was just something about it. The cover looked interesting, and the story looked scary! But, when I popped in the movie I got a whole different thought, then I expected! First of all, the camera work totally [stunk]!!! The directing [stunk]!!! And the make-up for the murders looked so fake!!! The only good part of the movie was the story! Thats the only thing!! Also, the movie was annoying!! But in other words, I'd say its pretty scary."
1,Not What I Ordered,"Ordered a brass replacement part and plastic was sent three times.Brass worked for eleven years, but plastic replacement only lasted one.Tried to reorder brass, but they've sent me plastic three times.Frustrating to deal with the returns!"
2,Wusthof,"Wusthof is high quality stuff, but there is no lifetime guarantee and the handles aren't dishwasher safe. If I was going to chose a set, Cutco knives are by far the best knives in quality and price. They also have a comprehensive lifetime guarantee that makes that 10 times better than this large wusthof set."
5,Web Solicitors,"Just to let you guys know, Cutco hires what they call ""web solicitors"" to hype up their products on sites like this. Also, Cutco is sold through demonstrations by Cutco salespeople only and these salespeople have an interest in bashing other knives on the net. Master Chef Wylie Dufresne told GQ magazine ""I have plenty of friends whose parents have Cutco in a knife block. You pull them out and they're all as dull as can be."" Norman Weinstein, a nationally recognized kitchen knife skills instructor was quoted by the Baltimore Sun newspaper as saying this about Cutco: ""Why, why, would you buy such a knife?"""
4,Perfectly good back-up battery,I needed an emergency back-up for my newish Canon sd870. This one was so cheap that it makes me realize exactly how badly Canon is ripping me off! I like my camera and this battery is perfect to have charged and ready in case the Canon battery ever runs down. It seems to work perfectly well.
3,"Premium Nb-5l, Nb5l Lithium Ion Replacement Battery for Canon Digital Camera","Premium Nb-5l, Nb5l Lithium Ion Replacement Battery for Canon Digital Camera is not the camera battery that my camera uses and if the description had been more clear i would have known that before i bought it. now i'm stuck with something i cannot use.thanks anyway,RB"
1,camera battery,Hello.i ordered a new battery for my CANON camera.I received the battery in no time and was dissappointedbecause after charging the battery.IT WONT WORK with my CANON camera.it was cheap and not the original canon camera replacement battery.so i was dissappointed with my purchase.i should have just spend the money for the original .thank you!
3,More than 1/2 OEM life,The compatible batteries for the cannon pro-shot arrived promptly. As expected though they do not last as long as the OEM battery.
5,excellent,"battery is verygood,lastlong in useWith my camera I took over 300picsbut battery still work ,I keep using my camera more than 1 week"
1,threw it away because the charged time in the battery was too short,"The price was too cheap, but sorry to tell you the truth, I threw it away because the charged time in the battery was too short to be used.. Cannot recommend it for consumers.."
1,Terrible!,I've had this for atleast a year. Brand new it wouldn't hold a charge for more than a couple of pictures. Often we have to put it in and take it out over and over to even make it work even though it was freshly charged. We keep it strictly for emergencies.
3,so far so good,"Have been using this battery for about a month and it seems to last about as long as our previous OEM battery. We are not heavy users though, so take it with a grain of salt. Very pleased with the purchase.Update (5/23/11): After using the battery for a few months, I now believe that is does not last as long as the OEM battery did. OEM battery used to easily last a full day of shooting while this one runs out near the end of the day."
3,"Good Price, Not Near The Capacity Of Official Canon Batteries","It does the work it needs to as a backup, but it has no where near the capacity that an official Canon battery would have."
5,they work.,"i ordered 2 of these batteries based on other reviews. i got them quickly. fast shipping.they work. i charged them when i got them and tested them when they were done and they worked. i dont know how long they last, but i have 2 so its easy to change them out as long as the charger is always handy."
4,Nice Product.,"Now I have a spare battery, when one is in the camera the other is on the charger. I never miss a moment."
1,Bad Battery,I got this battery before a trip and the charge only lasted a short time. It was supposed to be new. What a rip off.
2,"cheap battery, what can you ask for?","each charge can take up to 100+ pictures, I have it for a week, it may last for couple months:("
4,they were cheap enough,"I ordered these batteries for my new Canon camera. They arrived in a prompt manner, and I charged them up. Then I returned the camera so I'm stuck with the batteries but at least they were cheap enough, even with the shipping charge."
1,Don't send,Said me that was a problem with the product and i'll stay without it and without another. They return my money but i stay without the product i want.
3,Batteries seemed to swell up,"I ordered two of these batteries and used one of them for quite awhile recharging it frequently, then I could not fit it in my camera any longer! I opened the second one and it wouldn't fit at all, so I had to disgard it! I won't be ordering these again!"
5,BEST AT PRICE,Best at Price. Useful as backup battery. I have bought 2 and working very well. I just dont expect much on these battery but i am totally satisfied on its performance.
1,Battery doesn't hold a charge,I figured that for what I paid for it that it would be bad battery. I was right! It doesn't hold a charge. I was taking pics of my son's 2nd birthday party when the factory battery died on me. I inserted this battery thinking that it would be ok but it immediately died! My favorite saying is you get what you pay for!
4,Cheap and they work,The price was right for sure. They last about half as long as the Cannon battery but are a great backup. I have more problems with the SX210IS than I do with these value priced batteries.
4,Works,"Purchased 3, and they all seem to work. At this price you can afford to buy several to have on hand when you need them."
2,Little Range Extension,"I had no problem setting this unit up. I popped the CD into a wireless laptop, and two minutes later both lights were blue. It was when I went to place it at a further point in my house that I found problems. The farthest I could go from WRT54GS Linksys router (with high gain Linksys antenna) was 20 feet, in a straight line, unobstructed (with walls in between, it's more like 15 feet). After that, the signal was lost. (I was checking it on the laptop with netstumbler, which picks up access points and measures their strength.) Whether that's a problem with the router, or the expander, take your pick.Either way, pretty poor performance for the Linksys products."
1,Run Away!,"Do not buy this product! It is faulty from set-up to use. And nothing works without major doses of help from other users (as you've read here).And when it's set-up, it doesn't do a very good job.So spend you money on a new wireless router with extended capabilities.You are warned."
3,Be prepared to struggle,"When the range expander works it is great. Setting it up can be another story though. I have had it for about two years and each time I have made a change to my wireless setup it takes me a couple of days to get the expander working again. Part of my problem is that I know a little bit too much about this stuff (read complete novice who gets lucky occasionally). The last adventure was a couple of weeks ago when I attempted to change the level of encryption on the network. I finally discovered that the Linksys web site has a pretty useful download to help with setup (called Lynksys Easylink Advisor). It saved me and I finally got the thing working again, although I still don't really know what I did to fix it. Bottom line is that you should expect to struggle a little when setting it up."
1,Doesn't play nice with other brands,"I own a Netgear wireless router, and Linksys happily informed me that it the range expander could not work as a repeater with that access point. I would have loved this product otherwise: easy to setup and useful. Call Linksys first and ask them if it will be compatible with your router."
2,A major PAIN to install,"I like the idea of this product, but it is just not executed well. I consider myself intermediate/advanced in home computing/networking and I had the hardest time getting this to work. I did have to directly plug it in to my existing wireless router to configure it and it seemed to do the trick. I would skip over the auto detect as it never seemed to work/stick. Hopefully something better will come along... :/UPDATE May 2009 - I still have not gotten it to work consistently - so I would have to say skip it."
2,"It works at first, then it doesn't","Setup was a breeze, probably because I only use MAC address filtering rather than WEP, etc. Once setup, my network was expanded and everything was good for 2 days. Then the expander seemed to stop working, and needed to be reset to make it work again... every 1-2 hours. Then it started interfering with the network, i.e. signal was strong but there was no Internet connection. I recommend going with a Panasonic Powerline -- it works like a charm:Panasonic BL-PA100KTA Ethernet Adaptor Starter Pack Includes two HD-PLC (High Definition Power Communication)"
4,Range Expander Not Too Bad If You Call Linksys,"After reading all the horrible reviews, I was afraid to buy one of these. However, I have owned 6 Linksys products in the past and found that once you get them up and running they are very good (granted, it could be painful getting them working if you get the wrong tech when you call the 800 number). This range expander got me from 1 or 2 bars to a full 5 bars in a NYC apartment that has thick walls. If you willing to set aside 1 hour to set this up, I think you'll be happy. I'd bypass the including instructions and call Linksys from the get-go to spare you some wasted time."
2,Not Compatible,"Dear Valued Linksys Customer,Thank you for contacting Linksys Technical Support.I regret to tell you but the WRE54G is not designed to work with BEFW11S4 or WAP11. The WRE54G will work with the following Linksys devices: WRT54GS, WAP54G and WRT54GIf you have further questions, please contact us at (800) 326-7114 or send us an email at support@linksys.com so that we may further assist you. Please use this phone number given as reference for future support calls.Sincerely,Carmela SyLinksys - A Division of Cisco Systems, Inc.Product Support Specialist800-326-7114support@linksys.com"
1,Stay away from this product.,2 hours working with their tech support only to be told to take it back for a refund. The unit would not handshake with their own router! Something about incorrect firmware. Give me a break! We have to test and debug their product. Just throw it out on the market and then worry about if it works with other Linksys products. No thanks.
1,Of Limited Value,What is not clear from the product description is that it is ONLY compatible with the Linksys Routers listed. Have a different Linksys router? Forget about it. Unless you are using a Linksys WRT54G or WRT54GS router don't waste your money.
4,Security is an issue.,"I like this product. It extends the range just fine without attaching nast looking ""high gain"" antennas to my 54gs router. There's just one thing I didn't like about it causing me to return this product. It doesnt support any other type of encryption besides WEP 64 bit and 128. I have a different type of encryption system and I couldnt find out all the encryption system the wre54g was using becuase linksys kinda let it open ended on their website as well as the manual. I spoke with linksys they said there will be one that supports other encryption standards in the near future, so I will wait."
1,Don't buy from Lake Gregory Books,"received item in February about the 19th. Did not work, called linksys they said it was out of warrenty, really a product I just purchased was out of warrenty. Called Lake Gregory books they said ship it back and we will refund, that was 3 months ago I shipped it back and they said they would refund within 60 days, they never refunded my money. Credit card company will have to fight with them I guess bc I am denying the charge."
1,Don't Buy It,"I don't recommend this product to any one. This item sounds great, but don't let the discription fool you. Yeah, it will expand your network, but only if you don't have AT&T as your network provider. It doesn't connect well with the 2WIRE, always loses signal, and I found its better to use the internet with out plugging in that useless junk. Call the 800 number, they didn't fix a thing. I though it would be best for them to set it up,via remote connection to my computer, so they offered to do so. It cost 9.99 and you would think they know what they are doing...NOPE. The guy ended up messing up my home network and since the linksys was displaying it works he called it good. They din't refund my money because the guy had said it was working when I got off the phone with him. Point of the stoy, DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP UNLESS YOU HAVE A LINKSYS ROUTER."
4,Setup is not for the faint of heart,"Don't think that setup will necessarily be as easy as Linksys states. The setup software did not work and, because I had a secure network, neither would the auto setup. I turned off the encryption on the router, still no go. Finally used the included cable to link directly to my Linksys WRT54GS router. Setup then went smoothly. Relocated the Expander to the desired location, turned it on, it linked flawlessly. Provides a strong signal and works well. My rating is based on performance, not setup, which I would give a 2."
1,Linksys Wireless-G Range Expander WRE54G,This product works intermitently. Setup is a pain. I would NOT recommend.
2,Not Very Reliable Connection,"I found this unit to be constantly going ""off-line,"" losing its synch with my main wireless access point. I got quite tired of resetting the unit. I don't recommend it."
1,Go with netgear,"Amazon service was excellent. I cannot say the same for this product. It is difficult to set up the security and the range is not at all impressive. I have to constantly reset the router due to loss of Internet connectivity and video downloads are choppy. I'm going to dump my $200+ Linksys wireless net investment and get the Netgear Rangemax. It's not worth the aggrevation.Again, Amazon service was excellent as usual."
1,"Old is New, New is Old","I ordered a brand new Linksys WRE54G Wireless Range Expander. What I received was a WRE54G VERSION 1. Linksys is currently on version 3 with this unit.Version 1 lacks a RJ-45 port to facilitate plugging in a network cord to assist in device setup.It remains to be seen whether this will have any material impact on the performance of this hardware.This is a general principle issue, selling an old, back stock unit, as though it was new."
1,Misleading Marketing = Return,"Spent 90 minutes on the phone with perfectly nice tech guys before the truth came out: Range expander won't work with my BEFW11S4 router. Incredulous, I read off the back of the package that ""the Wireless-G range Expander is compatible with both Wireless-G and Wireless-B devices"" -- to which the tech replied that "" 'devices' means cards, not routers."" When I noted that was incredibly misleading, the tech acknowledged that yes, they've had a lot of complaints. Which raises the question: Are the Linksys marketing guys evil, or just dumb? Either way, it's pretty hard to recommend a product that doesn't work as advertised."
1,This thing does not work,"1. I gave it one start because I could not give less(no option).2. Linksys went out their way to make management software incompatible with standard Windows interface.3. Anything you change requires reboot.4. When I call support they ask bunch of personal info first, then told be to disable security (WEP) then they made me reboot my computer couple of times.5. Last and main $100 + 5 hours the damned thing still does not communicate to the Linksys router. I can not reset it, I can not access it even thought the wire connection."
5,It's really easy if you don't have network security,"This thing took me all of 12 minutes to set up just by following the instructions set out by A.R. from Maryland in one of the previous reviews. It works perfectly. However, I have no security on my wireless network, so the ""making it secure"" part might be trickier.Basically though, setup's a breeze if you have no wireless security."
5,Using on a Belkin Network,"I installed the WRE54G in an all Belkin G component wireless network ( router and desktop network cards of various models supporting 5+ PCs ). Had no trouble with the installation and setup which went quickly.... The setup wizard on the CD worked AOK. I did not disable existing encryption ( WEP ) during the setup. Set WEP on the WRE54G after setup. The WRE54G was plugged into an existing available power outlet in the hallway of a 2 story house about 15 feet from the router which is in an ajacent room. After installation, the signal in the back upstairs bedrooms of the house went from a previous very low ( or no signal ) to an excellent high level signal. Everything seems to be working AOK.... time will tell I guess."
3,I now have excellent signal thanks to this,"I bought one at Office Max, it cost a lot more than the deal I found here. I'm happy with my purchase. It works perfectly."
5,LINKSYS RANGE EXPANDER,GREAT TRANSACTION. BUYING A REFURBISHED UNIT THRU AMAZON WAS A STROKE OF GENIUS ON MY PART. GREAT SAVINGS OVER BUYING NEW (50%) AND COULDN'T ASK FOR BETTER SERVICE. I USED THE LINKSYS TELEPHONE HELP--LINKSYS AGENT TOOK CONTROL OF MY COMPUTER AND SHE DID ALL THE INSTALLATION AND UNIT SET UP BY REMOTE CONTROL. FROM THE PHILIPINES NO LESS!!!! BEST $10 I HAVE EVER SPENT. UNIT DOES EVERYTHING AS ADVERTISED.
2,"Appropriate Name Would Be ""Non Range Expander""","Auto config actually works, but not much else regarding this product does.Range improvement was non-measurable in my experience. Seemed very sensitive to placement relative wireless router: too far it couldn't connect or keep connection, too close it didn't offer much range expansion.It frequently resets, and restarting it with autoconfig requires turning off WiFi security, requiring resetting devices wirelessly connected to network.If I hadn't erroneously convinced myself it was helping my network range, I would have returned it within 30 days and purchased a wireless n-router and 802.11n USB stick."
1,nice idea poor execution,"Cannot get it to work. Had to go on a trip so by the time I got back return period was over. Have tried everything and cannot get it to function. To be fair, I am a luddite and it may be something simple I am missing, however I think it may not be for the novice or unteck savy."
1,Linksys is awful,I've gone through 3 WRE54G range expanders and they have all died. The last 2 died in less than 3 months! I'll never purchase another Linksys product.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!,"If I could give a negative 5 I would. I bought this product and it was supposed to work with any router. I didn't. So I bought a Linksys router. It didn't work with that either. Moreover, it is only AFTER you try and setup the expander that you get an error advising you that you cannot use it with WPA security (only the mos t effective security for wireless home networks). Then, I spend an HOUR on the phone with Linksys tech support and they can't get it to work either.I'm no technical genius, but I've setup a few different wireless networks. This is absolutely the worst, most difficult product I have ever come across. Absolutely wasted an entire day trying to get it to work. Terribly frustrating"
1,linkstinks,Do not waste your money on this piece of junk. I never ever got it to work even after numerous attempts. I struggled through the cryptic online instructions and wasted hours with the useless phone support personal who spoke an unrecognizable form of english.
1,Make sure you know what it is compatible with!,Make sure you know what it is compatible with! It only works with certain linksys products and they do not tell you this. Could not get it to work with d-link or netgear products!
1,Horrible Experience,"Purchased this from Best Buy. Was on phone with support in India for almost two hours. Still could not get it to work after tech took control of my computer. Seemed not sure of what he needed to do and he was Linksys Support! Called Windstream where router is from and they won't help me because I did not purchase extender from them even though it is the same they use. Will have to call computer wizard to come out to home and install as I am sick of fooling with it. After tech had called me back a couple of times due to poor connection on his end and we got cut off, he never called me back the last time. Gee, thanks. Poor directions and c.d. does not help. Linksys really needs to re-think their directions and have people in tech support that know what they are doing."
1,Don't waste your time,"This unit is worthless and cost me 4 hours of my time. I followed the directions for installation, looked for help from other users online, contacted customer support (who told me it was out of warranty and they could help me for a fee), and finally gave up. I would think that Linksys would make a better product that would actually function easily with another of their products (I have a Linksys router already). Buy something else if you are considering this unit."
3,Get the right version!,"Make sure you order version 3 of this product. Version 1 and 2 very likely won't work and linksys won't support them any more! So before you buy, confirm the version in the model number or you may waste your money the first time (like I did)."
1,Cisco-Linksys Wireless-G Range Expander WRE54G ver 3,"The software that comes with the expander will not download on windows 7. I search the internet looking for a software compatible with this system that will allow it to download unto windows 7 no luck. I've been trying to connect the wireless expander and had no luck since day 1 no luck. The extra antenna they suggest for you to buy is useless, because there is nowhere on the expander to connect it to. I had no luck in removing the current antenna and try connecting the new one."
3,less headaches than the Hawking wren,"I used the cd, followed the instructions and 5 minutes later the light turned blue. I never turned off my WEP security and set the WPA in line with my router. It drops out every now and then(not nearly as much as the Hawking Wireless N. I just have to unplug it and plug it back in and everything's fine again. IT also occasionally causes an IP conflict (seems to be an inherent problem with repeaters) but the unplug/replug solves this also.Definitely less headaches than the Hawking. I've had to reconfigure that three times with the CD and I bought that after I bought this. If the office was on wireless G I would have bought another one of these for it."
4,WRE54G Set-up Problem Solved?,"I also had a frustrating time setting up the WRE54G expander. But I think this is the answer. Disable the security setting on your wireless router. Set up your WRE54G using the same settings as your router (Gateway, channel, etc). Save the changes. Then go over to the router screen and enable WEP security with a suitable pass key. Then do the same to the WRE54G. But here is the secret that I found. To the right of the pass key is a drop-down with OPEN showing. This can be dropped down to SHARED. Make sure SHARED is showing. Then save the changes. The expander should then work as expected. I believe the problem is that the router and expander cannot use the same pass key unless provisions are made for them to share the pass key.My WRE54G works fine with my Linksys WRT320N. While the WRT320N can be WDA encrypted, the WRT54G is limited to WEP.John"
1,Horrible,"The only thing that's as bad as this piece of crap is the actual Linksys router.I bought this because my router would not get signal to my bedroom, and it's only a single level house, 1800 sq ft. The booster is a bear to set up, and I could't get into the system to try to change my security password. I had to call Linksys, and was on hold for 30 minutes before I even got a tech on the line. She treated me like I was 4, and had no computer experience. Total call time: over 1 hour.After that, I could not sign my laptop onto the Internet. Without the booster, I could sign on but had a weak signal. With the booster I had a very strong signal, but could not sign onto the Internet.Again with a call to Linksys, this one lasted about 45 minutes. This tech was better than the last, but he couldn't fix it either. And, he admitted he was in Isreal!This is going back, and I'm buying a whole new system. Don't bother with this router. It's a piece of crap. Just like the whole Linksys company."
4,Incredible expander!!!...once you get it working,"I am sharing internet with my mom who lives 3 doors down (single family homes) and across the backyard. We were getting a very weak signal at our house (no signal in the basement), and after trying the linksys antenna to boost the signal (did nothing), we decided to try the WRE54G. We were trying to connect with the linksys BEFW11S4 router and knew it would be hard. After about an hours worth of attempts, I tried another search for information on how to connect them and hit the jackpot. One user stated when trying to connect the WRE54G with the BEFW11S4, you must downgrade the router firmware to 1.5 version. I did this and connected within 5 minutes using the set up cd. I now have an excellent connection on my main floor and a very good connection in my basement. I am just in awe of the difference this has made and the range it can provide. Bottom line, if you can get it running, it is well worth the money and then some."
1,Should be NO stars. Useless piece of garbage.,"Am experienced computer user, tried everything posted by others on this review board. The light nevers turns blue, never seems to connect to my network. Although I can access it via its web-based interface, I can't get it to actually work with my WRT54G router. After multiple attempts at trying to get this to work, I have to simply draw the line and say FORGET it. Don't be the fool who buys this torture device."
3,3 stars for bad instructions,i spent an hour trying to figure out how to get this working. i'm not computer illiterate either. i followed the instructions perfectly and it didn't work. i got fedup and went on amazon and saw Anthony Taylor's review. i use the directions in his review and I got it working in 2 minutes. the range extender works like a charm. 3 stars for linksys on bad directions. 5 stars for anthony taylor.
1,Does not work; obscure instructions; no telephone help,"A complete disaster. I'm an experienced home user with half a dozen machines, although not a technical expert. The automatic setup did not work, possibly (I later discovered) because there are several other networks nearby and that may have confused it. The CD setup program worked well enough, echoing lots of information which is good. It ended obscurely with ""WRE54G cannot associate with this AP in replication mode"". I imagine this means, in English, that it won't work with my access point (which is not a Linksys brand one). But it would have been better (1) to say so before I bought it; (2) to say so in plain English; (3) to at least occasionally anwer the support line (there is one especially for Amazon customers, which is nice at least in theory). After listening to bad music for a very long time, with no sign of any human contact, I gave up. No more Linksys brand gear for me!"
2,Worked well then Died,"This device worked well for about 8 months boosting an open signal from a WRT54G router. In rooms across the house from the router the signal went from ""no signal"" to ""very good."" It was very easy to set up, I simply plugged it in to a wall outlet, pressed the auto configure button on the side of it, and it was working. After 8 months of sitting in an empty air-conditioned room it stopped working, the lights do not light up, and it just doesn't turn on anymore. Unfortunately I discarded the paper work and packaging so I haven't contacted customer service. It was a good product until it failed."
2,Intregration into network,This product is a real PAIN to add into a Linksys wireless network. You would think since the expander is a Linksys product that it would be easy to add - NOT. I'm still not sure how well the expander will perform since I can only use it for about an hour before my Linksys wireless network locks up.
1,Very difficult to configure,The documentation is worthless. The configuration utility does not 'see' to device on my network. I eventually was able to get it to join with my existing linksys wireless network in a way that is not covered by the documentation. Stay away from this product unless you are willing to spend some significant time to get it to work. Linksys should be ashamed.
1,I was warned...,"The previous reviewers said it wouldn't work, and they were right. Now the setup wasn't particularly painful. I have a WRT54G router and the automatic setup trick worked, almost exactly as described. It did take more than a minute, and three tries.Greatly expanded connectivity on my wireless network. Extended range as advertised.According to speedtest.net resulted in a 90% reduction in data rate to/from the internet from machines, whether they were connected via the extender or not. Hard wired machines were unaffected, as expected.On the plus side, Amazon's return policy was quick and efficient!"
1,It died after 18 months,"Don't buy this product!!! After 18 months of intermittent behavior, it got a permanent red light and then died. It never worked as expected."
1,Linksys Wireless G range expander,Its a nice concept. The range expander would not wrk even when I seek the assistance of Linksys tech support. Infact the tech request that I return the expander. He claim the produc is faulty
3,"Difficult to set up, but great once you have it going.","As with nearly all of the wireless products out there (especially Linksys), this was a pain to set up. Following the directions was no help at all. I needed to have my computer friend (who makes $$$$ at Amazon), set this thing up to work right. If you are looking to buy, just make sure you know someone who can install it properly, cause chances are, the directions won't be sufficient and you'll need some computer guy's help."
1,2 units crashed,"I've had 2 units crash in 6 months, spent countless hours on the phone with Linksys support (calls usually 2-4 hours). I would not recommend this to anyone. I've had to do a hard reset on this unit about once a month and reconnect to my rounter each time. It's honestly not worth what I paid for it."
3,Linksys Wireless-G Range Expander WRE54G,This range expander works very well once you get it set up. It took us a while to get it set up and the biggest problem we have is securing the connection. Apparently this is a problem with the extenders.
4,"Works really well, once you have resigned to having to call customer support","Install complete. I used to have pretty poor signal from my wireless router in my bedroom until I installed this device. The only problem is that the installation software for the pc is problematic at best and requires a call to customer services. $9 and over an hour later, everything is set up and I am delighted."
1,Piece of Junk: Don't Buy!!,"Okay, first of all the thing comes with absolutely no instructions, only a cd with a used guide in it that is of no help what so ever. Secondly, unless you have a Linksys router you are basically screwed. I have a Belkin N+ router and there was no way that I was ever going to be able to used the expander. Then, once I called the 800 number they honestly tried to tell me that they were going to have to charge me $9 to fix the fact that THEIR product was not compatible with my router. When the guy said that, I packed the thing in the box and returned it. I would never reccoment this product to anyone.... EVER!!!"
2,I might have loved it...,"..if it would have worked. After days of customer support calls, I decided to cut my losses..."
1,$10 Bucks For Customer Support,"The user guide was no help, unless you have a Generic setup. All I needed to do was to set the SSID in the stupid part. Then, when I called up Linksys for support, I spent 10 bucks to download a program, and save THEM time and money.Let me repeat. It cost me $10 so that Cisco can save money. I guess there's a sucker born every minute. Me.Next time, I look for FREE support. For goodness sakes, I spent good money to buy the stupid router."
3,It's ok... Get something cheaper/better.,"So yeah, this thing isn't that great and personally don't think it's worth the money.Pros: V3 with up to day firm ware and Hard Wire port. Extends the range. Simple web based interface. Works with a Linksys WRT54GL router. Stable connection.Cons: No instructions in box to set this up with out CD. Range doesn't increase very far. Expensive. Weak antena. Takes 50% of your bandwidt, so make sure you don't put it at less then 2 bars from your router.Other: I bought a WRT54GL with this to replace my aging router. The WRT54GL gave me a 2 bar signal out of 5. I put the extender near the dead zone and only gave me 3-4 bars 15 feet away. Not much of an increase. Given the fact that half the speed is gone from using the AP. I was exspecting 5 bars. Oh, well."
2,Wireless range expander,The expander does not give me a wireless signal across the length of my house which is only 120 feet. It was easy to install but...
1,"Computer Geeks misrepresented the item as ""new""",Bottom line: They sold it as new and sent me a repackaged item that was missing the power adapter. I hated dealing with them. I eventually got a refund but I will not deal with this seller again.
1,DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!,"Where do I even begin ---- we'll, I'll start off here. While this product says compatibility with most 802.11g routers, it DOESN'T WORK UNLESS IT IS LINKSYS. This product added all of these fake ip address to my d-link to the point where every computer on my network didn't have internet. I had to reset the settings for the box from comcast, the router, every computer, etc... I contacted linksys for 3 hours hoping that they could figure it out but no. AUTOCONFIG IS FAKE!!!"
2,Listen to the other reviews,"Even with all of the various set-up tips listed on Amazon's website, and the ones on the Linksys tech support page, the router's setup still took me a full day to complete. Now that I finally have it working, I'm keeping my fingers crossed that my power doesn't go out and all of my wireless devices have to reconnect to it! The only upside is that the WRE54G appears, by inspection, to at least be extending my wireless network's range into areas of my house that had very weak signal strength previously."
1,product did not work / Inadequate customer service,"Without going into great detail, I cannot recommend this product. It did not expand the range of my wireless router, and after SIX hours, yes that's correct six hours with customer service, and speaking with four different ""specialist"" on three different occasions it worked, but it didn't expand the range. During this time they managed to completely disable my cable modem at one point and I didn't have any internet service at all. The ""expert"" told me to call the cable company because the cable modem somehow mysteriously sopped working after three years while he had me rebooting every device attached to my computer. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this product. I sent it back and have had a great sense of relief ever since"
5,Tricky to setup-but it does work great once you get it going,"I'll make this short because there are plenty of reviews on this product. I purchased the item to add-on to my linksys wi-fi router and modem. Although the instructions say it easy setup I also had some trouble until I read several of the reviews which included instructions (or tips) to get the thing working. Once I followed the steps in the reviews I had it up and working in a matter of minutes, and it allows me to have full coverage throughout a 4 level townhouse...If you have signal strength issues because of a large, or multi-level situation, and you are currently using linksys products, I would say this is a ""must have""...Good Luck..DDD"
2,"Seriously frustrating to setup, but eventually works","Like others have expressed, this is seriously difficult and frustrating to setup. I am glad I knew I would be in for a fight before I bought it or I might have given up. No, I WOULD have given up. I have an excellent understanding of networking."
1,Go elsewhere I'd highly recommend.,"I have a Wireless-G Linksys Access Point (WRT54G), that works wonderfully, that I wanted to use with this Linksys Extender - the Extender never did work in spite of having no security, and all the latest firmware. The support and directions offered by Linksys for this products are horrible. I can't stress enough how impossible the documentation and software is to use. Use something else."
2,Severe limitations--don't even try with a non-Linksys Router,"I have a Hawking Technology router that works without issue, but have some dead spots in my house and purchased this item to try to fix that issue.It didn't work. I tried to configure both automatically and with the wizard, and neither worked.I then got on the phone with customer support. Although the person was a little difficult to understand, they were polite, but then told me that I needed to get version 2 of this device, which, confusingly enough, has the same product ID number, but, as others have noted, includes a different image on the front with an ethernet connection.It may be a bit of an oversimplification, but the techie I spoke with basically indicated it was pointless to try to use the thing with anything other than a Linksys router. I find it extremely irritating that this was not indicated on the packaging or marketing materials."
3,"Works ok, questions about reliability","We've used two of these range expanders on a WPA-Personal network with both Mac and Windows machines, a v.1 and v 3. Set up on an XP machine wasn't horrible - the most important step was to disable the WPA security during the expander setup. As some others noted, they sometimes lose connection, necessitating a ""sneaker net"" trip to the device, unplugging it, waiting a bit, and then plugging it back in. Signal strength and speed drops the further one is from the wireless router, as expected. But one expander was at least 100 feet across a street, and the speed and strength was acceptable.My greatest concern, currently, is reliability. Yesterday the second expander quit working. Both now have failed after about 2 years. I don't know if this is an anomaly, but I am thinking of replacing the expanders with a Belkin or Hawkings device. I have had good luck with other devices made by these companies."
3,must reset often,"I often have to reset the ranger expander by unplugging it. By often I mean once a day. If I don't, my computer shows an excellent signal but I have limited or no connectivity. When it's working-it works well. However, the problem could be how the cable company set up our internet for our business---they just plugged in the original and we have no tech support."
2,Good while it is not broken.,"I had my unit for about one year. Installation was good, it work quite appropriately and transparently behind a sofa in my family room. It provided service to a section of my house where my main WiFi signal was too low, the signal was in fact significantly improved. Therefore, everything here sound very good so far. The only reason why I am giving it 2 stars is because it broke after about one year. Not like other Linsys devices."
1,Buyer beware,"I thought that this product would be ideal for my situation however it has to be reprogramed almost every time, I called consumer service and ended up off shore(what's new) and they wanted to blame my router and charge me for information which I refused as I believed that the problem was with the booster. After requesting to speak with a supervisor she decided to put me through to a tech - finally, And I waited for over an 1/2 hour before hanging up. At this point I would NOT recommend this product at all and I'm very disapointed in Cisco systems as a company."
3,does what you pay for,The one button set up was a scam and not to disappointing based on what I read. Nearly had it by myself but needed to run the install from a second computer not directly connected to base router. Don't know if I would have discovered that variable for a while. Set up was easy once I got through to cisco helpdesk and turned it over to them. They were helpful for an additional $10.00. I guess it was worth the money considering the time factor to setup. It works fine I have good signal strength where I need it. I guess if it were easy we would not need tech support; what would they do for a living? Chase stray cats?
1,This thing just stinks,"Let me make this clear. This thing just doesn't work. In fact, it makes signal clarity worse. My computer gets confused between this signal and the direct signal from the router. The WRE54G has to be reset ALL the time. Save your money and time. Do not buy this product."
1,Pure Frustration,"The setup CD didn't work. The printed instructions didn't work. Forty-five minutes on the phone with tech support didn't work. Trying every alternative set-up procedure I could find on the internet didn't work. I bought this thing to avoid dragging 50 ft. of CAT5 through a nasty, dirty, spider-ridden, cramped crawl-space. The crawl space is looking pretty good by comparison. A frustrating waste of several hours that I'll never get back."
3,"It works, even with my non-Linksys router with WEP.","The setup instructions were a bit cryptic, and I had to battle it longer than I thought should be necessary. I had to hit the hardware reset button a few times to try again, but finally figured out to use the setup program to configure the WRE54G to work with WEP on my NETGEAR router. First, you have to use the same key that you use on your router. Then if your router isn't made by Linksys, you'll need to change the default IP from 192.168.1.240 to one that falls into the range that your router assigns, in my case I gave it 192.168.0.20 . It works well, except that it locks up occasionaly for no adequate reason and I have to turn it off and on. Most of the time it's fine and works as it should."
2,Be aware of potential issues,"I have a v3 version, and I upgraded the firmware. I have a WRT54G access point. The expander loses connection frequently in my home (red light comes on). Seems if it's too far from the access point it has problems connecting to it and if you're laptop is in range of the expander and the access point then the laptop keeps switching from one to another and the expander sometimes drops the connection and needs to be reset to restore. It generally works but the reliability of the connection depends on where you are located and where the expander is located -- sometimes frustrating and I found myself simply unplugging it sometimes when I needed a reliable connection. I have also found the expander to be more susceptible to interference from other wireless devices than the WRT54G."
1,This One's A Non-Starter,"This unit is really tough to set up, doesn't live up to Linksys' range claims, resets itself without warning, and/or stops working. I had problems out of the box and Linksys tech support couldn't walk me through making it work so they sent me a replacement. It took a couple of hours on the phone with the techies to get the new one set-up and it seemed to work for two weeks before giving up the ghost. I'm tired of babysitting a unit that's supposed to work in the background. Unreliability makes it an accessory that's not woth having. I'm getting ready to move soon and this range expander isn't coming along - I'll find another brand/model for the next house."
3,expander weak,I thought the range expander would be a little stronger than it is. I rate it as mediorce.
5,works great for me,I bought this product from Bestbuy. I've had it for a year now and no problems. When I got it I just plugged it in and pressed the auto config button and it was ready in a few seconds. I have the WRE54G Version 3 if that means anything.
3,Tough install.,"We recently installed a Linksys wireless router WRT54G2. It required the two of us about two hours to setup and get operational. We quickly found that it didn't cover more than a few rooms in our house and not the far office about 60 feet away on the same floor. We purchased a Range Expander, WRE54G to cover the other side of the house. My wife, a software programer for a large company, spent 2 hours trying to get this installed before giving up. I, a software designer and training manager for a small company, gave it a shot next. I called Linksys right away to get there help. Linksys gave up after 90 minutes and suggested my paying ten bucks and letting them take control of my laptop to complete the install. Another half hour later and we were up. Piece of cake. Two evenings, a divorce, speaking with an Indian accent now, and we have two bars in the far office!"
5,Linksys Wireless-G expander - WRE54G,"I would highly recommend this expander. Used in an office enviornment through 3 walls and a distance of approx. 50 feet. When I first set up my pc, I had little or no signal at all. Others who were at about 40 feet and only 2 walls, had poor signal strength, but, were able to acess the internet. Rather than go through the expense of hard wiring, which was suggested by my local PC store, I decided to purchase this expander.Although I did have to call Linksys Tech support in getting it set up, after 5 minutes, I was up and running. Now, all PC's in my office are showing ""Excellant"" signal strength. Have used for about 1 month with no problems at all."
3,Linksys Wireless-G Range Expander,"It works, but not fantastic (at least in my setting). If you're expecting a dramaticresult, you may want to be careful."
1,What a pain!,"I purchased this item after carefully reading all the other reviews. I, like others, cound not get it to work with wireless security turned on. I even tired using the ""tricks"" described in another review.To be fair, the product worked fine without wireless security, but I see little point in helping my neighbors tap my internet connection.I am very disappointed in the product."
1,Waste of Money,"I was hoping this product would raise my poor signal I had downstairs. making it work was just too complicated. I followed manual instructions but yet it wouldn't work. I don't live in the US so for me there is no free support line, I live in Colombia, so I called and after 10 minutes a guy from India I guess answered me. he told me that my Linksys router was version 2, therefore it was not compatible with my new Wireless G expander, anyways i spent 30 minutes on that called. so the next day I went to buy a new linksys router. version 6. I coudn`t make it work with g expander so I had to call again, another 30 minutes long call with a Indian guy. Hard to understand them. anyways, I did all what he told me, and yet it wouldnt work. Just dont take the risk, you will be dissapointed."
1,Big Deception,"Do no bother to buy this gadget. It is almost impossible to set up, while once the configuration is over, it will not deliver its promise of expanding the range of the broadband. Very disappointing."
1,Ghastly horrible piece of equipment,"Although I did my research which indicated that this was compatible with my existing Linksys equipment, it was in fact not. In order to use this equipment, I had to operate in an unsecured mode (which is NOT compatible to me). Linksys customer service was horrible, and kept telling ""just turn off security.""Even when it was running unsecured for trouble shooting, it did not appear to actually expand the range of my wireless network and would lock up on me requiring reboot ater reboot.I finally had to admit defeat and return it to Amazon.I solved my problems by ditching Linksys and going back to Apple AirPort. No need for a repeater; the main access point covers the entire house with a strong reliable signal, securely, with no dead spots. Plus it looks neat!"
5,Works as advertised,"Thanks to Anthony Taylor's excellent instructions, I was able to get this working in just a few minutes. It works great and extends the range of the router nicely. The best part is that you can just unplug it and move it to another part of the house to improve reception there.One word of caution; once you have access to the setup pages and you're about to enable the WEP, make *sure* you have the exact same settings as your router WEP. I set the passphrase right, but I left the default setting of 64-bit encryption on the extender while the router uses 128-bit. I had to reset the extender and start over again to get back in. Double-check to make sure the WEP settings are identical on both devices before enabling WEP."
1,Disappointing,"I bought the range extender to work with my WRT54G purchased in June 2003. Following the simple instructions, I plugged it in, pressed the auto configuration button for varying lengths of time but never managed to get the ""link"" light to turn blue. I called tech support and after several failed attempts to upgrade the router firmware with level 1 and level 2 assistance, I was told my router's firmware (the original v1.00.8) was ""too old"" to be upgraded. Their solution-buy the high gain antenna. According to the product description the WRT54G router should be compatible with it....nowhere are firmware upgradeability issues mentioned and flagged as potential problems."
1,Definately Not Ready for Prime Time -- Avoid,"Now you have been warned. The product is truly the worst and the most time consuming electronic device that I have encountered. I spent 10+ hours trying to get it to work -- referencing reviews / suggestions here and on other forums, in addition to Linksys technical support. Finally, I was able to get the device to link to the router (both blue lights), but the device did nothing to improve signal coverage in my home. I am very disappointed, but clearly I am not fully without fault, as I was plenty warned by others who have conveyed similar experiences. John Chambers should be ashamed of himself for allowing Cisco to release such a shoddy product."
2,"Unimpressed, and it doesn't take much...","Bought it new. It was a pain to set up for reasons already stated by other reviewers, but I'm used to that. Its performance was inconsistent, requiring sporadic, annoying power resets for no particular reason. It was close enough to the router to rule out signal strength problems. After five months the lights went out and it stopped working altogether. Pretty shabby all things considered."
3,"Good, but a pain to set up","After spending over 2 hours on the 'phone with Indian technical support (which I also had to do when setting up my G router last year), I moved the extender to my downstairs office - approx. 30 feet from the router. My signal was boosted from a miserly 11 mpbs (and that's on a good day) to anywhere from 24 - 54 mpbs. Now I know that my DSL doesn't come in that fast, but I can say, without a doubt, that the extender works. You just have to persevere..."
1,wrong Version,"I orderd this product to later be told I needed version 2. There is no way to order a version of this product so I sent it back. This is not Amazon's fault, this is Linksys not correctly telling the consumer the right configuration."
2,Not really worth the money,I installed this on my existing wireless system hoping to extend the range a short distance to my garage. No such luck. The range expander increased my wireless range by about 10 feet. Not enough to make it worth buying.
5,"Once set up, works great","I bought the expander because my linksys router wasnt reaching into my living room, where I have the xbox 360 set up and where id like to use a wireless laptop. I bought the upgraded antanna for the router because the expander will only repeat the signal strength it gets. I may not have needed them but I'd rather not worry about having a weak signal. Setting up the expander took me a few days including using the e-mail customer support, and also calling the center in person. The instructions that come with the expander didint include how to set it up with the security modes i was using (WPA). But the phone call was all it took to get this thing working properly and now i enjoy a secured wireless connection throught my house."
2,Make sure you have exactly the right WAP,"It doesn't work with many popular Linksys WAPS (such as the older BEFW units) It was my fault to buy it without knowing that, but other issues cause me to write a less-than-favorable review anyhow.If your WAP varies any from the allowed ones above, this unit will not work. Also, if you try it, then can't use it, be aware that its setup will overwrite the wireless control configuration on Windows XP SR2. You'll have to turn that back on, and re-set-up your wireless network. I advise that you make yourself aware of the SR2 Zero Configuration setup before trying this product.The documentation's troubleshooting section is miserable."
1,"Wrong Router, do not order","Make sure you don't order this unless you have the right router:""Linksys' WRE54G Wireless-G Range Expander [reviewed here] is a WDS-based 802.11b / g repeater that Linksys says works only with its WAP54G access point and WRT54G and WRT54GS wireless routers."""
1,no fully compatibility with 802.11b,Linksys says it can be used with the standard 802.11b but is not totally true. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't.It looks I will have to buy the G wireless router.
4,Exelent... but....,"This product works great, Its exactly like having two acces points in your house. Set up was easy and quick, barely took me 5 minutes. But let me point out i dont encrypt my connection, I really have no need. This device wont let you encrypt your acces so... if you encrypt your wireless network DONT get it, at least not yet. They will probably fix that in a few months. But it does work as advertised. Range is slightly lower then a regulas Acces Point, but since this is just a complement to an existing network I see no problem there..."
1,Don't Buy! Baught in 2007... I have series 2.,Poor Poor Poor! This is the weakest item Linksys has have let out of there doors. Firmware(what makes this do what it does) is trouble right out of the box.I use a Linksys wireless router and it still gives me many problems even after 2yrs. This year it finaly gave out(died)on me. Buy any other Expander over this!
1,Don't Buy this product,"This product does not work. I bought it to connecto to a wrt54gl. The wizard changed my network settings and failed to reverse the settings. Using manual setup seemed to work and link showed as active, but once it showed as active all connections to the AP dropped and would not reconnect.Linksys support was slightly worse than useless.Save you self some trouble and money, buy the WAP54G and install dd-wrt.this product is worse than a brick since you can't even use it as a doorstop."
1,The range-expander I bought did not work.,"I tried to go through the installation instructions for the wireless range expander and found that my PC system consistently failed either to find the range expander in the network, or that it could not be set up and run properly when it could be found. I called Linksys and worked through some diagnostics with a technician. After several failures, he informed me that I should return the product to the store where I bought it."
1,Linksys -- Fix Your Firware or Fix Your Instructions,"Once it is configured, it works. But configuring the device can become a major headache. I own a WRT54G linksys router. Anticipating firmware issues, I updated the firmware in my router. Big mistake! Turns out that the range expander has ""stability problems"" (to quote Linksys tech support) with all but one version of firmware for the WRT54G. I had to install an old version of the WRT54G firmware that could only be accessed through Linksys' ftp web site. This is bad enough. However, what really has me steamed is the three hours I spent on the phone with Linksys tech support before I was referred to a tech specialist who finally came clean about the firmware problems with their products. Shame, shame Linksys.Update your online knowledge base with detailed directions for installing the older firmware on the WRT54G--and instruct your tech support people regarding the problem."
3,Increases range and blood preasure,"I recieved the range expander at 12:30 this afternoon, It's now after 4 and I have finally got the darn thing working. I read in the instructions that all you have to do is dissable WEP and press the expanders ""Auto Configuration"" button. This failed miserably, resulting in just red blinking lights on the expander. After monkeying with this for a little while, I tried the CD. Everything went fine untill the end when I got this very obtuse error: ""Can not get the confirm response information."" After trying everything in the troubleshooting section of the manual I finally called Tech support. The first question the guy asked was if my wireless router was broadcasting it's SSID, it doesn't for security reasons. He said this was my problem. It was my problem. Now everything works great. My machine which had a signal strength of 1 bar now has 5."
4,Replaced old/broken expander,Our old expander worked seamlessly for quite a number of years until someone backed their chair into it and broke it. We replaced it with the same brand!
2,Bad bad bad,It didn't work. I was so disappointed with this item. Don't buy this. You will waste your money and you'll regret it.
2,useless,"This was difficult to install, hard to use, and slows your internet down to a crawl. It was a very bad product with even worse customer support."
1,Stay Away,"This extender does not work. I bought 2 of them and even after hours setting them up, the coverage area never changed."
1,Should have listened to others that had problems!!!!,Tried to install the extender as the directions state for WEP. Simply would not work. Performance on the network dropped to limited instead of getting better. I would not purchase this product. Poor documetation. Tech support barely speaks English. Responds inadequately to email. This is not my first problem with a Linksys product. They can and should do better.
4,"Easy Install, IF you've read the reviews","Follow the instructions in the October 16, 2004 review by S. Hing. There is also a note I saw somewhere about NOT having Ver.3.x of the firmware for the Linksys Router WRT54G.I took off one star because of the firmware issue and beacuse it should work out of the box.I downloaded the firmware from Linksys, but had to ""live chat"" with them to find out how to download firmware ver 2.x. The web site automatically wants to give you 3.x firmware.After loading the firmware and following the S. Hing note, it connected and works great. The router is in a corner of the finished cellar and my laptop is on the first floor in the other side of the house. Before installation I had to bring the laptop to the top of the cellar stairs to download email. The laptop now has a strong signal in the office."
1,Poor instructions -- Difficult Configuration -- Not worth it,"I tried one. After much messing around with it -- searching the web for lessons learned -- upgrading firmware on my Linksys WAP -- I did manage to get it working without the WEP turned on. However, by that point I was so disgusted I did not move on to the additional steps to get the WEP turned back on with it. I noticed the ""used and returned"" bin of my local computer store full of these things the other day.... Now I know why. I was so disgusted I returned mine. I am now using other products (like high gain antena and another WAP) to handle coverage issues. This is a bad product design, with bad instructions. Not worth the trouble. I have many other Linksys devices that work great. This one is just a stinker."
2,"Item worked, range increased, link light still red. Quality?","A bit of problem with installation, the red/blue link light never indicated a good link with the Linksys WRT54G even with the units within 3 feet of each other. With Linksys support on the phone, we figured out that the link was in fact increasing the signal percentage on other laptops in the house. Even though the Linksys representative couldn't explain the red light issue, he suggested that I not worry about it if it is actually working. Almost works right isn't a good enough solution for me. Sorry Linksys. As you can see from my other review, RSLU2, this is the second ""Quality"" issue with Linksys in two weeks."
1,"Doesn't work, expensive paperweight",I should have been suspicious of all the bad ratings but thought Cisco was better than that. I was wrong. Auto config didn't work. Two calls and over an hour of my time no results. Wanted to return it but since it didn't rom Amazon I can't. Infinite Surplus has a no return if opened policy so this useless piece of s*** will not be used as a paperweight. If you want to give it a try make sure you don't get it from them. At least at least Amazon has a return policy.
1,Avoid. Its not worth it.,"I bought this to extend the range of the wireless network in the house I live in. It's a 3 story house, and the network is very weak on the ground floor where I live. My parents have an older version of this product installed at their house, so I knew it had some challenges to set up, but figured I could work through them. WRONG. The auto set up does not work, apparently, because the network is WEP protected. So after some searching on the internet, I find a manual work around. Which I did 3 times. None were successful. I went so far as to call Linksys support, where I was connected to a tech, but he then proceeded to ask me to hang on while he did something (unintelligible). 20 minutes later, I was not on hold, but the tech was not responding when I asked questions and tried to get his attention. So customer support gets a 0. I'm returning this product. What a waste. Does anyone even have an unsecured network anymore? Linksys needs to make sure the product is easier to use!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"This is my first review ever, but after 3+ hours of Linksys ""tech support"" they told me that this os simply not compatible with D-Link routers. Not sure why they couldn't tell me that within 1 minute instead of running me through a series of hoops. In any case, don't buy this range extender if you own a non-Linksys brand router."
4,"Excellent signal boost, once I finally got it configured","As many others have already written, configuring this device can be time consuming (especially if you are the type that prefers ""trial and error"" over reading the manual). As long as you temporarily disable the security on your router, the ""auto-config button"" will connect the expander (v3) with a WRT54G router with no problem. Once connected, you can connect to the device's interface via your web browser and configure the security settings (WPA-Pre Shared Key/AES was the winner for me).My basement was my weak spot. My connection has now increased from intermittent/low to excellent."
1,BE CAREFUL OF THE VERSION NUMBER,"WHEN TRYING TO SET UP FOR 8 OR 10 TIMES WITH A D-LINK ROUTER, I GOT INTO A LOOP OF ""NOT ABLE TO FIND WRE54G IN RANGE"".THE NICE TECH SUPPORT IN INDIA WAS QUICK TO INFORM ME THAT MY VERSION 1 WAS INCOMPATABLE. HE SUGGESTED TO RETURN IT AND BUY VERSION 2 OR 3.BE SURE AND READ WHAT IT IS COMPATABLE WITH ON THE BOX OR IN THE TECNICAL DESCRIPTION ONLINE.I WOUND UP BUYING THE D-LINK DWL-G710 - IT IS COMPATABLE WITH ""VIRTUALLY"" (I HATE THAT WORD) ALMOST ALL ROUTERS."
4,"Tricky to install, but LINKSYS was great","Don't buy the ""out of the box, one-step to install"" stuff. I used this repeater to extend my signal to another building, boosting the signal from my Linksys router. The skimpy instructions and CD that come with the unit are essentially useless and did not work. Calling Linksys involves an interminable phone tree that ends in India but once you get thru the tech's were incredibly helpful and patient in walking me through a complex process. If you have a high-speed connection, Linksys' Internet Chat option is also quite good, and very quick. So, if you need to streghten your signal, and are patient about setting this unit up, it works VERY VERY well, taking my previous 30% signal strength at 75' (between two bldgs) and amping it up to a full 100% signal with no drops. Spendy (on top of the router) but well worth the trouble once you have it set up."
1,"Loads of experience, still won't work","I have spent three days working with Cisco support and this device still won't work with our WRT120N. It isn't listed as one of the supported devices, but after three sales associate and Cisco themselves assuring us it would work, we bought it. Guess what. . . it doesn't work with the WRT120N. I build and repair PC's, and have set up many networks, but these devices just won't work no matter what tweaking I do. When I can get it to work as an extender I can't get any PC's to connect to it. When the PC's connect to it then it won't work as an extender. Double check to made sure this is compatible with your router before you purchase."
1,Bogus,"I am rarely fooled but this is a classic case of ""bait and buy"" tactics. The install was unnecessarily complicated, the tech people hung up on us three (count them) times! After being taken for an additional $9.95 (which I've yet to see reimbursed) they had the gall to ask for an additional $30 bucks because my linksys router was ""beyond warrantee"". Until they had me mess with it, the wireless router worked perfectly fine and ALL I wanted was to extended my range to weak areas in the house.Poor product, poorer service. Please do not be dooped as I was."
2,Pain to setup...,"What a pain to setup (and I work in IT), still trying after hours of effort. I will call the 800 number and see what happens.Will update tihs review if this thing ever works."
2,It is not a great option.,"This item only works with laptops. This is going to sound strange. I could not connect my blackberry 8900 to this only my laptop. This is the second linksys product I received to strengthen my bad linksys router. Instead I am going to buy a new router that is not Linksys or any brand connected to Linksys. The set up is annoying as well. They give you a cd, but you are just supposed to go straigh into the setup page via web browser. I only gave it two stars because it worked well atleast with the laptop."
4,Works Great,"I bought this Wireless expander because a friend of mine, when firt i install i tought was not working ok after checking some information on the manual, i discover that if you have security you have to plug the WRE54G to your network with a cable, so after this i'm working in a extenss of more than 100 mts from my house to get internet to a friend and it works great so go ahead try it you will get surprise of how much will help to build you internet Network."
1,Doesn't work for secured WiFi networks,"It is very hard, if not impossible, to get this to work if you try to secure your WiFi network by turning on encryption, turning off SSID broadcast, etc. Before buying, ask yourself what your security needs are -- if significant, you may want to avoid this."
2,Linksys Wireless-G Range Expander WRE54G,"This device does not work nearly as well as advertized. It took a long time to set up and program properly with the base unit, it frequently drops the signal, and we have to reboot it. It beats not having a signal repeating component, but it certainly has flaws. The set-up can, if it does not go flawlessly, bring tears to your eyes."
3,"It works alright, for now","Although I was told by a friend that this product would be easy to install, it was not. I have invested far too many hours in getting my network to where it should be and right now I still don't have the nerve to set up my WPA encryption, for fear that the expander will stop communicating with my wireless router. For now I am only using MAC address filtering for my security but that will not work for the long-term. The only reason I got this expander to work at all was thanks to the other reviews on this site that offer advice on set-up techniques. Additionally, perhaps we are doing something wrong, but the actual power of the expander is not what I expected it to be. We have an upstairs patio that we needed coverage on and we ended up needing to place the expander right next to the door to the patio in order to get the signal out there.All in all, it works for now but I'm not impressed. Buy it only if you don't have a better option in mind."
4,"Good Product, Set Up is a Little Tricky Unless...","Like all the other people reviewing this product, setting up the expander to your wireless network is very tricky especially if you follow the instructions on the CD Rom. So much for RTFM.So I scoured the internet and fellow Amazon shopper's instructions and the best instruction on how to set this unit up came from cubanomx ""cubanomx"" posted on December 11, 2008. I followed his instructions and the unit was working in about 10 minutes maybe less. I spent two hours fiddling with this and was about to return it.The unit works like a charm. I went from 1 bar 5.5 mbps and very low strength to 5 bars 54.0 mbps and excellent strength. My router is in the basement corner and I had dead spots on the main floor on the other side of the house. Now the network is complete, no more dead or low coverage spots."
4,Good extension,"I am using this in conjunction with the linksys 54G wireless router, it picks up very well and does what its supposed to do. Other than being a bit pricey I have no complaints"
3,Does well enough,"This one was set up in a "" tough environment"" Expanding a wireless network in a bldg with concrete floors through which wireless signals do not penetrate. I ran a permanent cat Ve wire to this extender and it does extend the wireless network although it is somewhat flaky. It needs to be reset every so often and I'm having a bit of trouble with the WPA working with all of the devices. I admit that could be my fault (possible config errors). I think under these circumstances I'd have been better off just getting another basic Linksys router and using it as an expander."
1,Frustrating - works inconsistently with WEP security,"I am using this extender with WEP security enabled and it has been a source of frustration.The issue is that it sometimes does not work for no reason at all (although it seems to be related to the number of devices using the expander), rejecting access for devices that had no issues connecting previously. Upgrading the firmware had no impact.Considering I am using this in conjunction with a Linksys wireless router, I would be expecting a much better experience."
2,50% Chance of Working,"After calling Linksys found that this expander doesn't work with anyting but Wireless G routers. For anything else, like my Linksys Wireless N Router, there is a 50/50 chance it will work. It didn't work at all, had to return it, but Amazon was GREAT, no problems at all...."
1,Never got it working,"I spent 2 hours trying to set it up on 2 separate occasions and never got it to work. Im generally a tech savvy person, but I am not network administrator type. You should be the network administrator type if you want to buy this product. Was a waste of $80 for me."
4,Look out for version of this device you purchase,"There are 2 versions of the WRE54G-- one with a ethernet port on the front and one without. I have a wired/wireless router, so was able to set up the one with the Ethernet port with no problems whatsoever. This one gets the 4 stars.A second one I purchased, however, did not have the Ethernet port and depends on the configuration CD mention in the other reviews. I was not able to get this one configured. Zero stars.Although the picture on the Web Site shows the unit without the Ether port, would expect that all the recently manufactured units would be the one with the port. No guarantees, though!"
1,Watch Out for Compatibility Issues and POOR Linksys Support!,"I purchased this product after a discussion with Linksys tech support concerning signal strengh problems encountered after switching over to a router model that had included phone ports for broadband phone service. The Linksys tech was from India, somewhat lacking in English skills, and DEFINITELY in technical knowledge- symptomatic of the effort to drive American tech jobs to the lowest possible bidder.The tech assured me that the range expander was compatible with my router after keeping me on hold for a few minutes. Needless to say, it was not compatible with my router, and refused to connect to my wireless network. Linksys acknowledged the error of the technician, but refused to switch mine for a compatible product.Sooo, take this as a warning and double verify compatibility before buying this product, and DON'T take the word of a Linksys technician. Do otherwise, and you may also become a victim of outsourcing."
2,Linksys Wireless Expander,"The unit is probably fine. BUT getting it to work with a laptop is no picnic. AND if you get a connection after an hour of experimenting, it's hard to keep the connection. AND difficult to get on the internet. BUT other than that it's perfect!?!"
1,D.O.A.,"My batting average with Linksys products is about 40% -- I've had a number of DOA's (dead on arrival) and this is one of them. After a couple of hours trying to set up, and an hour with tech support, they asked me to send it back."
1,Could not get it to work,I am not used to Linksys products that simply do not work. I spent several hours trying to configure this product to work. Reset button did not work. Auto-configure did not work. Buyer Beware!
1,Never got it to work,"Neither the wireless autoconfiguration or ""wired"" setup worked, with or without WEP enabled on the Linksys wireless router (the Linksys Setup utility would not run, on Windows XP, no explanation by Linksys support). After 1 1/2 hours on the phone with Linksys manually configuring it, still got no increase whatsoever in wireless signal range (I am not convinced it was ever configured correctly). Linksys' final response was ""Well, it must be defective, you should return it and try out the replacement in the store before you take it home."" No thanks."
5,Linksys Wireless-G Range Expander WRE54G,Contrary to other people i had no problems getting this up and running. Signal strenth vastly improved and connection very stable after 2 weeks of use.
2,Does not work with older WAP11 devices,"I tried using this device to extend the range of my wireless-b network. I have had wireless-b (WAP11 version 1 plus router) for about 4 years and wanted to extend the range into a redone garage. After about 2 hours of mixed signals, changing from dynamic to static DHCPs, etc, I called tech support. I waited 25 minutes on hold, after which they told me that the extender does not work with WAP11 devices older than version 2.8. The product info (on the website or the box) does not indicate that. I returned the product. I am dissappointed in Linksys' communication."
1,Good luck setting it up..........,"The marketing material for this says ""...the easy way...""Ha!I tried: (1) the Linksys website; (2) India phone tech support; (3) having my tech-geek friend come over and play with it. Even the suggestions by previous reviewers by Amazon (which were FAR clearer than option 1 and 2) didn't work for me...(but, to the credit of said reviewers, I did come the CLOSEST to getting it to work by following the steps the reviewers suggested. (Yay Amazon! ;-)Simply couldn't get my wireless network (all Linksys equipment) and this thing to talk to each other.If you buy this thing without having a degree in IT, good luck.Back to the store it goes."
4,"Horrible Set-Up Experience, but Great Performance","As with many of the other reviewers here, I struggled mightily with the set-up process for the WRE54G, with even the excellent instructions in a couple of the other reviews coming to naught.However, my experience with Linksys technical support was solid, and they got me up and running fairly smoothly. To do so, we connected the range extender to my router by the included ethernet cable; once we were done, we disconnected the cable and the extender works like a charm several rooms over. I now have great coverage throughout the house.My advice: perform the set up with the hardwire ethernet cable connected to your router, and power cycle (not reset) both the router and the extender as needed. I was unhappy at first, but am now very pleased with the WRE54G."
4,"does what it says, took 2 hours to set up","I used this to expand the network of my Linksys wireless G router. The router does exactly what it advertises, with the exception of setup. If you buy this router, be prepared to spend multiple hours on the phone with technical support giving you a 50-step process of upgrading firmware, manually setting IP addresses, and doing many resets of every piece of networking hardware you can think of. I got the idea that my case was not unusual, and this is just how it is designed. But other than that, once it's configured it should stay that way as long as you don't change your network settings, and it works as promised extending the range. Nice and small too."
2,Works but flakey,"As other reviewers have noted, it is tough to set up. If you have set up other wireless products and have some patience, you'll get it done, but it is a pain.However, once set up, it flakes out a lot. I have to power-cycle it almost every day. It will be working just fine one second and the next, I have full connection strength but no packets flowing through. I have set up a power strip under my desk so that I can power-cycle with a tap of my foot.Perhaps there is a firmware update that solves the problem, but I haven't bothered to check."
1,Difficult Diffcult Diffcult !,POor compatibility.Instructions on the leaflet are poor.Have not been able to set it up with my standard ATT 2 Wire modem. Have tried like a gazillion times.. more than 5 total hours spent.Looking to return it. I think it has compabitibility issues with non link sys stuff.
3,Instructions are a practical joke,"Please don't try to install this thing through wireless mode. I had the same horrible experience trying to do that. Then I reset the expander and connected it to the router through an ethernet cable. After that you have to copy the wireless router setting through the web page [...] to the expander(SSID,default gateway,wep or wpa password). Once this is done and saved to the expander you can remove the cable and move the expander wherever you need it to be.This should work. It worked for me. Hence I am posting this to save a lot of aggrevation. The instructions are a practical joke."
1,don't buy if you need 128bit security,"how come you can't give less than 1 star?????i waited several weeks for the wre54g to arrive. when it finally arrived, it looked really pretty. however, having spent a couple of days trying to get it to work with my network, using 128 bit security, i've decided to send it back and continue using multiple APs instead.Basicallly, the setup utility doesn't allow you to enter 26chararcter security keys to generate the 128bits required for that level of security.i spent a wasted hour on line with Cisco's help desk and eventually just terminated the session because the support guy was obviously working on dozens of sessions at the same time and asking really helpful questions like ""is the extender set up for 128bit security?""... derrr."
1,Does not work with WEP,It does not work with WEP contradictory to the claims by Linksys and set-up instructions.
3,Buyer Beware: Linksys Compatibility Misleading,"Buyer beware: Linksys is misleading regarding this product, it says that it supports the wireless router WRT54G at the 2.02 firmware level, but this WRE54G does NOT support WPA encryption, which the WRT54G does. I contacted Linksys tech support on 2005-03-30 and they told me that the WRE54G supports ONLY WEP encryption, that I need version 2 of the WRE54G (WRE54Gv2), which amazon.com does not carry as of yet. My wireless network runs WPA encryption and cannot revert to WEP encryption so I cannot use this paperweight called the WRE54G. I gave the product 3 stars because it has potential."
3,Some Range expansion,"Set up was easy, I had it installed in a very few minutes.A bit disappointing in that I was expecting more range. I was trying to improve internal range from our upper floor to the lower, as well as to an outbuilding located near. I had to play with the location to improve the internal reception, but even after moving the unit to an external area in a window facing the outbuilding, I receive only faint sporadic connection.Its probably worth the investment for the internal application, but am going to have to look into other antennae options to reach where I want. Funny since I live in a very rural area, with little to no interference or incumberances."
1,"Difficult Setup, Poor Documentation","Well, reading the other review, some loved it some hate it. But you should not have to go outside the normal setup included to get this think to work. I spent many hours trying to get this piece of crap to work, and talked with customer service morons. Basically, they need to revamp the setup software to work right.You sould also note that this product required strict use with linksys products. I think your time would be better spent getting better antanna's, which can be found here off amazone.com"
1,It doesn't work.,"Tried every possible way, from every possible source. I am quite tech savvy. It does not work. Buy another brand, it is not worth it."
1,Might work if you're lucky -- but waste of time for me,"The good news is that so many people have had problems setting up and configuring the WRE54G that there is a wealth of information available online to help you troubleshoot. I tried everything I could find and think of for about 8 hours, and still can't get to the configuration page. After reconfiguring my entire network (routers, modems, and clients) several times to try to communicate with the range expander, I'm throwing in the towel. I may have a bad unit; however, I'm done wasting my time. It's in the mail back to Amazon."
1,Works? Not if they can help it,"I bought the range extender and set it up and it seemed to work for about an hour when it itterupted the wireless signal and required me to restart the network. I tried talking to Cisco who at forst gave me the runaround since my router was out of warranty, nothing wong with router. Afgter much complaining I finnaly spoke with someone who then told me my router was not compatable..... HMMMM the box says it was...... oh they found someone who can't type and left off the 2 on the website. The same build firmare and release date but they can't figure it out. I WILL NEVER BUY AGAIN. customer service is very important for me and to get snubbed like that gets me angry and frustrated. I am NOT a NOOB to the computer world and when something doesn't work and you won't help.... I will be sure to tell hundereds of people."
1,"BAD repeater , BAD","I bought 1 brand new. The instruction/manual was completely unclear, and the setup process failed 8 times before it all of a sudden succeeded. After installing the repeater which is suppose to boost the signal strength it turned out that it only got 10% better than my existing wireless signal. So what's the point having this repeater? I put the repeater at different places in my house and finally found a place where the stregth is like 80% BUT non of my computer can ever get connect to it. So I still have to connect to the original wireless network that I am trying to fix w/ this repeater. This device is bad. I am returning it for sure. I got a dlink instead. it's been shipped to me as we speak."
1,Very difficult to setup if you are security conscious,"The range extender is a great idea, but the Linksys model fails to make maintaining security simple when installing this device. Installation is overly complicated."
2,Linksys Wireless Expander,Difficult to configure with instructions that are not complete. Users must have the right firmware on their wireless router but this information was only available on the Linksys website.The auto configuration and the unit does not seem to work without the SSID broadcast being on.The Expander also tends to lose it's connection to the router without warning.Not a product for the computer novice. A lot of trial and error to get it to work.
2,Forget this if you think it'll be easy to setup,"I've setup 5 or so routers, a wireless media center and wireless printer server combined in less time than it took to get the Range Expander setup. Want to know my secret for finally getting it to work? After trying every possible piece of advice, techinical support and location for setup, I finally got it to work by holding the Range Expander by the antenna while the setup utility was searching for it.If it weren't for the excellent wireless signal stength that I now have throughout the home, I'd never give this more than lowest rating. Anyway, I think it'll be less aggrevating to try any other range expanders out there."
1,Returned product,I bought this hoping to extend our wi-fi to users in a temp office across the hall. After trying to get this set up for 45 min I finally got it configured and it started to cause massive IP conflicts on my network. I opened a chat window with their tech support from the website and the tech rep's first suggestion was that I power cycle my network! After 3 more chat sessions and no result I finally got a call back from a senior tech who had me upgrade the firmware. That still did not fix my problem so now I have to find another range expander.
3,"Poor quality, impossible set-up, but no choice","I've had three of these. The first two stopped working after a year or two (one was a warranty replacement). Setting these up is a random walk. The first time, I spent 1 hour on the phone to a very nice Indian lady. We worked through a very complex series of steps and she told me it was successful but I suspect it never did anything. The setup for the second machine worked like a breeze but the hardware failed after a year. Setting up my latest was pure mystery: the setup process claimed success but the network was definitely not extended. At some point I pressed the auto-configure button and then it all worked. If this keeps running for a few years it will be worth it. Unfortunately, I am not sure there are any good alternatives out there and I'm not prepared to spend the time and money experimenting with the few other products that claim to expand wireless network ranges securely."
1,WASTE of my time!,"JUNK!!! Well, I have heard some positive reviews about this product so it obviously works for someone, however it did not work for me. Even with a lot of assistance from the Cisco-Linksys support staff it did not work as advertised. We (Cisco and I) eventually got it in sync with my wireless router but it only amplified the signal by approximately ten feet, if that. I would not recommend this product to friends. It was a waste of time."
1,2 hrs w/ tech support & they say the unit is bad - return it,2 hrs w/ tech support & they say the unit is bad - return it. so I am returning it and have ordered the Hawking HWREN1 Hi-Gain Wireless-300N Range Extender.
2,Not impressed,"Purchased this item in the hopes of extending the range of my, NON-Linksys, wireless modem. The setup instructions ""assume"" that one has a Linksys modem, but does not make this obvious when purchasing. The setup instructions DO NOT work if one does not have the Linksys modem.I am not an IT guy, and don't want to be one; I want to use the computer as a tool, and I hate wasting time setting the thing up. I've gone to forum sites that have suggestions, but they talk in ""computer"" language so I haven't finished learning that yet so that I can hopefully then hook the item up!In summary if you are not software/computer savvy, and you don't have a linksys modem, DO NOT purchase this."
2,Beware - only works easliey with linksys routers,You should only buy this if you use a Linksys router and note that if you do it will halve your network speed - this is in the tech support section of the linksys website. (Even though Linksys put 54 in it name!). Non-linksys routers need to support WDS (So much Linksys's implementation of the 802.11b/g standard ). But good luck setting that up!
1,non-functional,"I tried everything to get this to work. First I tried to use it with a a Netgear wireless router, until I found on the router page that it might not support it, so I bought a new Linksys WRT54G that was guaranteed on the box of the range extender to work. Despite hours on the phone and on line with customer service, and trying every sort of manual and automatic configuration option, it never worked. Finally the Linnksys technical support told me that the WRE54G v1 must not be compatible with the WRT54G v5 and that I should return it."
1,Total Junk Don't waste your money or time,I had to use the tech support and spend over 1 hr to get this Expander to work. Then after about a week it stopped working. Had to call tech support again and after about 45 mins it was working. Then in about a month for no reason it stopped working this thime I was on the phone for over 2 hrs and could never get it working before I got tired of dealing with the support people that speek very poor english. I unpluged the range expander and smashed it. Felt very good to forever rid myself if this junk. I will now buy Dlink.
2,Better to add another router,"A nice idea but a waste of money and time. The WRT54g routers can be configured to act as a repeater (what this does) much easier than this device, you get a broader coverage with the dual antennas, and the router is actually less expensive than the ""range expander.""This device is all about marketing and people pay the price for it. Just get a second wrt54g, go into the settings, and choose ""Wireless Repeater"" in the AP mode screen. The one caveat is to make sure the router has at least v.3.04 firmware.I've done this for our office and it works exactly as it should across a very large building and two floors."
2,"Sometimes yes, sometimes no","There's no real way to tell if this thing will grab a weak signal or not. The installation directions are simple if you don't put a security lock on the device, but I've been in situations with it when it grabs and amplifies the signal, and some when it does nothing. And I can't figure out the variables.So it's a crap shoot."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"All these negative reviews are actually right! I really like LinkSys products (wired and wireless routers specifically), but this ""range extender"" just does not work. I spent over an hour on the phone with tech support in India (not fun), and they had the nerve to tell me the product works just because I could ping it! But the LED's should both be BLUE, yet they are not. The LINK light is RED -- this is an indication that something is not working properly. Not to mention the configuration software is a joke. It never worked, and always ended by saying ""The setup utility was unable to locate a Wireless-G range expander..."". So the lights are RED, the config software says it cannot find the range extender -- but Tech Support has the nerve to tell me its working? Please, save your own precious time and money and do not buy this junk."
2,Before you do anything else...,"If you have the WRT54G router, go to Linksys and download the latest version of the firmware. Note that if you have an older version (I had WRT54G v1.1) you cannot get it at the product page. You need to go to the downloads section (Support/Downloads)and select your version from the dropdown. Check under your router for the version you have. The versions of this router goes from 1.0 to 5.0 and trying to install the latest one from the products page will fail if it's not your version.I could not get to the expander address 192.168.1.240 before installing the firmware (version 4.20.7). After, it was smooth sailing."
1,Pretty much useless with DD-WRT,I was trying to use this device as a simple (albeit not in-expensive) way to extend the range of a Linksys WRT54G router running the DD-WRT firmware. After spending many hours trying configurations and reading forum after forum I was never able to get this device to route traffic. I had no trouble getting the WRE54G and WRT54G to see each other but when my laptop was associated with the WRE54G I couldn't successfully route any traffic.
3,It does the job,"I had to set it up manually instead of auto config which is ok if you know what you are doing, but probably very confusing to the average person.if you want it to auto configure, you have to disable wep, wpa, etc then do the auto config, then reenable. I thought it would be easier just to manually configure it instead.It seems to do a fairly decent job of extending range though not as much as I hoped or wanted. I have two areas I wanted better signal and I can't seem to place it in an area where it improve both areas at the same time, so I move it 15 ft one direction or the other depending on what area I want to use. There is a major throughput difference when I do this. All of this is going on within a 35 ft radius so I was not expecting to have to move it area just to cover two areas in such a small radius."
3,Does Not Work With UMA,"I bought this to extend WiFi UMA coverage for our BlackBerry throughout our house. When I could not make it work, I googled around and found out that it does not work with UMA. For all I know and, as attested to by quite a few reviewers, this product works fine with computers. But it does not work with Cell Phones on UMA.I didn't quite know how to rate this product since I never really used it so I have given it a middling grade."
1,Linksys Wireless G Range Expander not easy to install,The first thing this unit does when you plug it in is turn off your wireless security. When you run the CD that comes with the unit it attempts to communitate with thd device. If It fail the only message is connection failed try latter. Help desk is in India or some place like it. After two hours I stuck it back in the box and sent it back.
1,Useless. Barely adds any range. Aweful setup tools. No signal meter.,"Useless.Once I got it to work, the range extended less than 50 feet!The setup tools are painfully poor and you need to reset the thing way too often. Documentation it ships with are among the worst I have seen.No signal meter. You cannot tell how far to place the device from your router because it has no signal meter built in. So if you can't tell what the wireless signal is, how can you tell where to put it? You can't use your laptop's signal meter because that really doesn't tell you anything about the extender's actual signal.What an amazingly bad product..."
2,Not very stable,"It could just be me, but I had a hard time keeping this thing connected to my wireless router. Sometimes it would work fine, then my PC would drop the connection and I had a hard time getting connected again. Usually I would have to power the range expander off and back on, then reboot my PC. Also the signal quality was not great.I purchased a laptop from Dell and it received the signal much stronger from anywhere in the house without the range expander than my PC did with it."
4,Works Great Does as advertised,"I did have a lttle problem at first setting this up. It's a Version 1.0 so you cannot directly connect by wire. However, I read a few of the reviews and found that I had only to utilize the reset function on the unit and I was able to connect to my network with no problem. Great Price, Does what it says it does."
4,WRE54G Worked for us,"I needed to boost my D-Link router's existing signal in a nearby building so that our MAC mini could receive the signal. My laptop PC already received the signal when I added a more powerful antenna to the router, but the MAC mini could not. The Linksys range expander was relatively easy to set up and worked immediately to correct the weak signal problem, though it does not seem to boost the speed of the connection at this distance from the router.I recommend paying extra if necessary for the version 3 of the expander that says ""works with most wireless networks"" on the box. I saw other boxes on a nearby shelf at the store w/the same model number, but without the verbage quoted above that sold for $30 less. I guess it had older firmware or something and saving $30 wouldn't be worth the trial & error process to me...but who knows?"
3,Have your phone and plenty of time,"I had high hopes for that auto-config button, but no luck. It took me 3 calls (a total of 6 hours) to support to get the range expander set up. One rep tried to convince me that my DSL just happened to go out immediately after we re-enabled WEP; another disconnected me when she had to transfer me after I hit the maximum amount of time they're allowed to spend on a call. I had to upgrade the router firmwear, then downgrade it to another version. The third rep knew the secret: turn off WEP, enable it on the access point FIRST, then on the router. Now that it's connected, it works fairly well. I get a signal in the front of the house (generally ""very good"" strength), which I didn't before. However, it does seem to drop the link now and then -- I've unplugged it and plugged it back in again a couple of times to get the link light to come back on. Overall, it was worth it, but if I'd had more options, I probably would have gotten a different product."
2,IGNORES MAC ADDRESS FILTERING WITH NO WARNING!,"Works OK once you get it configured...The product does work once you get it configured, but to get it configured watch out for not only what is documented by Linksys (WEP must be disabled at the access point) but also know that if you are using MAC address authentication at your access point, adding this range expander totally ignores that and will allow anyone to connect to your network, even the access point that had MAC address filtering turned on. Also, if you have disabled the SSID broadcast at your access point, the range finder auto-configure will not work nor will you be able to get into the firmware to set it up manually. Set your access point's SSID to enable broadcasts before you try to configure this range expander. I have reported the MAC address security issue to Linksys and I hope they are working it (Case ID: 3711695). It really is a bad security issue. I would rate this product high if it were not for this MAC security issue."
1,High failure rate,I have other Linksys products. This is by far the worst. Wireless range not very good but the biggest problem is I've had 2 fail in 18 months. First a version 1 after about 8 months and now a version 2 (with ethernet port) after 3 months. Back on the phone to India.
1,WRE54G,Appallingly awful product. I hope they're using these in North Korea and Iran in mission-critical systems. We would have nothing to fear from them.
2,Not worth it.,This thing was a pain to set up and it only does a mediocre job. It's too expensive for what it does. If I could do it over I'd just buy a better gateway router.
1,Big time Headache,This is the most frustrating product I have ever purchased. I have worked over 5 hours to make this thing work. It continually says congratulations you have successfully installed the expander. I have reset and start over numerous times with no success. The red/blue light which is to remain blue if connected to the router continually flashes red then blue. If you have hair I would not purchase this product as you will soon be bald.
1,Doesn't work with Motorola modem,"We purchased this range extender to work with our Qwest Motorola modem/router. 1 of our laptops wasn't getting the wireless signal on the second floor of our house. After 5 hours of attempting to get the extender to recognize the router I came across a wiki that said that this is extender does not work with every brand of modem. It's not a universal extender, and therefore you can only be sure it will work with a Linksys modem. Buy a universal extender if you want to be sure it will work with your non-Linksys modem.After making a stop at our local big box appliance/computer store, we decided to just upgrade our modem to aNETGEAR WNDR3300 RangeMax Dual Band Wireless-N Router. It was one $169 item as opposed to a $99 router plus a $77 extender. The Netgear router solved our problems and increased the signal strength so that the problem laptop could connect upstairs, and there's only one unit to plug into the wall."
4,does the job,"This is the second one we've had to get. The first one just stopped working so we were forced to buy a new one. We looked into alternatives but with needing everything to be wireless to 3-4 laptops at the other end of our home, this was what we needed. It does expand the range. Our brand new router was still not enough to go from one end of our house to the other (over 100 feet and through stone...but I feel it should still be able to reach- though that is something to say about the Cisco Linksys router, not this item), so we decided on this. It works."
4,"Gritty, Flawless Film with an Outstanding Performance by Tim Roth","I had never heard of this film until 2012, but wow it is really, really good.All the casting and performances are good, but I was amazed at Tim Roth's. There aren't many - if any - British actors who could have carried off Roth's pitch perfect portrayal of this down-on-his-luck urban American character, Joey. I was transfixed at the transformation of Roth, just as I am when watching different characters played by Daniel Day Lewis. The film is worth watching for many reasons, but Roth makes it worth watching for his performance alone.James Russo, as the despicable but charming older brother Tommy, plays a perfect foil to the vulnerable, pleasing Joey.And it doesn't hurt that Debra Unger is delicious to behold, a fallen angel.Strongly recommend - certainly one of the best and most overlooked films that I know of.-Doug Grant"
4,GIRLS JUST WANT TO HAVE FUN!,"I don't know much about this band, but their music is really good, really fun. I want to describe it as ""bubblegum oi"", part skinhead tunes, part girls just having a good time, who harmonize more than they scream. They even cover Suzi Quatro's amazing ""48 Crash""!This CD appears to compile everything they have ever done on to one disc.Fans of Dolly Mixture and The Primitives would enjoy this disc, along with people into more traditional punk music."
3,"Complete collection,but...",There are more misses than hits in this bands career. Some really good stuff but you will want to be near the song skip button for about half of the CD.
5,refreshing,This movie is a refreshing out of the barbie box look at life from another point of view. Even the music was fresh and exciting. I ordered the sound track for my personal collection.
3,A pretty good snack,"It will not wow you with flavor, but it is a pretty good snack for the price. I liked to eat the partially frozen to give it a chewier texture. At room temp, the texture is a little disappointing."
3,Reliable?,"I ordered several of these bags for a charitable endeavor with school kids I'm heavily involved with. After only a couple of uses, one of the bags has started to tear away from the seam at the top of the bag. I have to wonder whether these bags are really tough enough to hold up to the treatment you'd expect middle school age kids to give a bag."
3,a little small,"Sorry I didn't fully understand the size of the bag on the website.It is good for a teenager, but not fit for adult. However, it is good product."
4,Good purchase,"I did not realize these Band-Aids had little holes so the boo-boo can breathe. But they are Band Aids, so they will get used one way or another."
4,Good!,They are the transparent type and they are resistant. Good enough for my toe.Its kind of difficoult to open though.
3,repetitive,"This book is mostly a rehash of the author's earlier book that I had bought. If you buy any one book that is written by him that will suffice, since he presents the same information much like old wine in a new bottle. I have to disagree with him on his criticism about weight training. It's true that excessive weights with improper form can cause injury, but any weight training programme done sensibly has it's own rewards."
3,"OK, but...","If you are totally out of shape, this is the book for you. That is because the exercises are not rough and when you are out of shape, anything works. That is why I give it 3 stars.The bad news is that the exercises DO take concentration. You just can't do them. You have to focus. Plus you run the risk of developing your strength out of balance.His nutrition info is out of date and he thinks lifting weights is bad. And he begins the book with a lot of blather."
5,THE BEST BOOK ON ISOMETERIC EXERCISES,Very Very easy to read. The exersises are easy to do and very efective. I always bau a few of these books at a time to give out. I used to have a big stomach and with in a few months it's now flat. I read two other books on this subjict and they were a waist of money.
5,Get this book,"This is a great exercize regimine that is easy to do, does not require tons of expensive equipment, can be done any where and any time, and produces real results. I wish I had found it sooner."
1,A Big Disappointment,"Bought the book two years ago, did the exercises judiciously and with an intense ""laser-like focus"" as directed, and did not build size or strength, and lost a bit of fitness to boot. I returned to weight lifting, and my first few workouts confirmed how much my strength diminished.I found the book last week while cleaning out a closet and promptly tossed it."
2,"Same as ""Pushing Yourself to Power""","Same exercises, even the same pictures, and of course, the same cocky attitude. I dunno, maybe a video would be better, but when I see ""JP"" sitting on a chair flexing his biceps, I don't get all that inspired. The book starts out just like ""Pushing Yourself to Power"" and has pages and pages of stories about Charles Atlas, Herschel Walker, et al, and how all they did was push ups, chin ups, squats, and sit ups and they became Greek gods. Then it moves on to nutrition (oh yeah, that's an exact science), then to page after page of cocky attitude and re-hashed pictures of ""JP"" and Wendy flexing and posing. I was very dissapointed in this book."
5,The best bang for the buck in the Transformetrics System,"This book probably has the most bag for the buck in John Peterson's Transformetrics Training System. If you're interested in equipment free exercise, this is a great place to start! You get the core Miracle 7 moves, which are a series of Dynamic Visualized Resistance exercises (using opposing muscles groups to add resistance to movement) and you get a whole series of other exercises to work the entire body."
5,miracle seven is really a miracle,"The amazing follow up to ""push yourself to power"" (see my review of that book too)i lifted weights fo 20 years,sure i got muscles along with joint,back and ligament pain.Also as an added bonus i received low energy,impaired movement and lots of wasted time in the gym.But no longer,why you ask? ""miracle seven"" and ""push youself to power"" are now my only regimen and i am free,free of pain and free of all that equipment and machines--I can work out anywhere! 3 weeks on this program and i have made gains i had'nt made in years and no more pain.if this sounds too good to be true,buy both books and see for yourself. You will not be disappointed.check out the awesome website and forum www.bronzebowpublishing.com"
3,Worth the read for only 13 bucks,"For only 13 dollars you can't go wrong here. It's not anything impressive, but I know we've all spend 13 bucks on a bad meal before, so go ahead and give it a read if you are into fitness, if all you use it for is the calories and diet plan it's a good buy."
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!,Do not waste your money on this book!!! The content is not easy to understand! The instructions are not clearly detailed! I wanted something that would be totally helpful and easy and it is not! Just wasted money!
1,the wate of money,i did not like the system at all. it just didnt work. iwas eating right takein my multivitimin and wanted to lose a little fat. this plan sucked.a complete waste of money
3,Political Landscapes and Plain English,"There are some extremely interesting ideas within this book, and Adam T. Smith also provides some useful discussion of past landscape (and archaeological) theory. However, my big complaint is about the language the author uses throughout. While I agree that sometimes it is necessary to express complex ideas in a complex way, as a general rule the simpler the language, the better the work. It is almost always harder to write well using simple words and sentence structures, but surely being instantly intelligible makes this effort worthwhile?I'm sure academics will find this a useful volume, but only the most persistent students will benefit from it."
4,A rare look at a little understood subject,"Kirpal Singh (1894-1974) offers, in this little known book, clear criteria for determining the authenticity of a spiritual master. In the l960's the Western world was first exposed to, and then flooded by, the teachings and teachers of the East. Often disillusionment was the least damaging consequence for many of those who became involved with them. Critical analysis of these teachings and teachers was either unknown, or discouraged by the sources themselves. Here, however, a lucid exposition of the criteria which determine whether such a one is ""commisioned"" by the Almighty, or whether the teacher has themselves even attained that lofty goal, are clearly laid out, and one is encouraged to apply them. The author was widely resected by religious and spiritual contemporaries as a living exponent of true spirituality."
2,Disney fails in the most simplest of tasks,"The menus are slapdash and the supplemental material is unmemorable. The commentaries by James Earl Jones are informative, but useless and the shorts are NOT shown in their entirety. Disney has done us the favor of removing the opening and closing credits from each short. Admittedly, my criticism of this DVD is probably one only hard-core animation fans will be able to relate to, but I find this DVD to be unacceptable.Maybe in some alternate universe Disney is releasing a 'Tall Tales' DVD, not in some feeble attempt to make money off of patriotism, but because they want to present their classic shorts the way they deserve to be presented. A world where Disney would even include 'Pecos Bill' and not think they'll offend people because he smokes cigarettes(like anyone cares).If you just like to watch cartoons, rent it. If you like to buy this kind of stuff for posterity, it's not worth the DVD it's burned on."
3,Could have been more,"I agree with all of the previous reviewers in that Pecos Bill would have been a great addition here. The lack of special features is also a problem. I also don't know why they called the last feature ""The Brave Engineer"" instead of ""Casey Jones."" The folks at Disney probably figured kids wouldn't know who he was. Shame. I hope Disney contiunes what it started with the Treasures series."
4,american legends,"THis is the video I was looking for, THe product was shipped very quickly and I was able to enoy it with my grad son, He liked it also and I feel that he was able to enjoy a very big part of my childhood with me. I use to watch the old disney catoons with my parents. IA tradition is passed on."
4,American Legends,Great Video with strong values. Got the product with no hassles and in excellent condition. Thank You! It's a keeper.
5,Brought back Memories,"The four short stories in this DVD brought back memories from when I was younger and saw them for the first time. Since it seems like these classic tall tales are not shared in classrooms anymore, I knew my 11 and 12 year old audience would really enjoy the stories."
3,Not what I expected.,"I was excited to get this DVD. I love Johnny Appleseed, Paul Bunyan and John Henry! Could have done without Casey Jones (Train Engineer). I was very excited to see John Henry but was not too impressed by Disney's interpretation.I also wondered why Pecos Bill (another favorite of mine) was not included on this collection. This would have been perfect if Pecos Bill was included. Again decent DVD, yet lacking."
2,Disney is a disappointment,"I am sorry I purchased this video. I wanted the orginal classic version of American Legends. This is not the case. Disney decided not to include the story of Pecos Bill. Instead they added John Henry. I do not know why, and I am sure we will never know why. I am a teacher in the state of Texas and I have used the American Legends in several different ways. I was excited to see them on video to use in my classroom. If I could I would return it and let Disney know how dissappointed I am."
3,Missing some classics,"I got this because I remember watching these as a kid, and wanted my kids to see them. Unfortunately, my favorite one as a kid no longer seems to exist - Pecos Bill! If they ever publish something with the original Pecos Bill included, I'll definitely get it."
3,Glad to have it,"I Love the original Disney shorts, and this is a pretty good collection. Others have already commented on the omission of Pecos Bill, who I also missed. But I haven't seen Casey Jones in A Long Time, and had forgotten how funny that cartoon is. The new John Henry short was pretty well done. I liked how the social context of the time was explained in the little space a short allows. The animation is fluid and life-like, but the rough pencil sketches can be seen under the color, which makes the cartoon look rough and is distracting."
4,It is a good video,I remember watching three of these cartoon shorts when I was a girl.I wanted my kids to see them since now is an important time to instill pride of our country in our kids. I especially like the introduction of each short by James Earl Jones. The only fault I see in this video is in the new short about John Henry. The animation is not clean. You can see lines in the peoples faces that should not be there. Other than that it is fine and my kids love the new songs. I rate it 4 stars.
2,Not what I expected,"I must admit I didn't do my research. I was expecting a collection of all new video shorts instead of one new and three older cartoons. While I thought the John Henry cartoon was fast-paced and visually exciting, the others showed their age. I had a hard time maintaining interest so I'm sure it was difficult for my six and four year olds. I doubt that this video will spend much time in our VCR. I would recommend this only to those nostalgic for forty year old cartoon shorts."
2,what a disappointment!,1. I'm glad I bought it used. 2. I've sold it already. 3. Buy the Silly Symphonies and save yourself this lackluster excuse for nostalgia.
2,Waste of Money,"Disappointed. The Johnny Appleseed is an ancient version, with antiquated language that gets my 4th graders riled up like: queer (odd) and gay (happy. The John Henrey Legend was not that well done or too interesting, though my students could tolerate that one better, haven't seen the 3rd one. I did like some of the narration for setting up the genre. I wish they were called or at least mentioned that these are also Tall Tales which is common in education. Wouldn't buy again."
5,American Legends,American Legends -Wanted to have this DVD for a few years. You did not disappoint. Would recommend this to many of my friends.
5,Razor sharp!,I used a Wusthof at my sister's house and fell in love with it. I won't let anyone else use them!
4,one off for price,"These classic knifes are exactly what I expected. The reason they get 4 stars only is because of the price/value. If they had cost 20% less I would have given 5 stars. These are standard german kitchen knifes. No bells, just sharp steel. You will like them."
3,I'm a little disappointed,The knives great when they arrived. They handled well and were very sharp as expected. I am disappointed they didn't maintain their sharpness as long as I thought they should.
4,"Luv, luv, luv the chef's knife","I would give these knives a 5 star rating, but the slicing & paring knives dulled quickly. The chef's knife I absolutely love and use at least once daily. The weight and balance of the chef's knife are a plus."
4,Minor damage but plays fine,"CD clip is broken, cd a little scuffed, but does not skip.Would purchase from again. Love classic I N X S"
4,Their most under rated album,"Once INXS landed with ""Kick"" they were known musically throughout the world, and many fans followed them thereafter. Before that breakthrough came 3 prior albums but none containing the stride they hit from front to back as they did on ""Shabooh Shoobah"". This album flows beautifully from track to track and contains zero filler. It may not be their widest known album, but it remains one of their best."
5,It is awesome!!,I love it. I just bought it and fell in love with it with the catchy toons and the amazing Don't Change. I bought this just for that song but now I love them all.
3,INXS: Shabooh Shoobah,"Australia's own INXS before thay became more of a household name. You'll recognize two hits that received fair radio play in their day. The rest of the album is not as polished as later works by INXS, but not bad for just emerging from the outback. If you are way into INXS from a few years back you'll find it okay. If you are just discovering INXS, you may want to start with some of their later albums. Rock-on!"
4,THE START OF MY OBSESSION,"This is the first INXS music I ever heard. It was not at all like anything else I'd ever heard. Over the years, I have dusted off my old cassette and given it a listen. Like an old friend you haven't seen for some time, it is familiar yet there is something new to notice each time you listen. Don't Change is the standout on this CD for me. It is the anthem that epitimizes INXS over the years. Since the resurgence of INXS music following the RS: INXS show I sum up my feelings on hearing INXS songs again on the radio after so many years with a line from Don't Change, ""I found a love I had lost. It was gone far too long. . . ."""
3,Shabooh Shoobah - INXS,"I bought the CD for the song ""Don't Change"", but forgot that the ""real thing"" is on there as well. As for the rest of the CD, it's pretty ignorable. But I'll listen to don't change over and over again as it's probably their best song."
1,One Thing only,"One Thing makes the cd. Pretty much everything is plastic eighties music, very synthetic and not very pure. This is an early version of the band, so I can't knock it too bad. For this cd to have such a high rating is unforgiveable, though. It's pretty bland for the most part with one standout song. Much better things come from this band. You can bypass this one, buy pretty much any other cd from this band, and come out a winner. This one just isn't that good."

You can buy pretty much any other cd from this band and come out a winner. This one just isn't that good."
1,Boring,"There are no investing secrets of masters here (the statisticians referenced were not investors). This reads instead like a Financial Analyst lecture or coursebook, and a badly written one at that.I could have done without the ugly, hugely biased section on Adam Smith and the completely false assertion that Reaganomics (i.e. huge deficit defense spending) saved our economy. FWIW, Carter appointed Paul Volcker to the Fed, and the Fed cut inflation down and revitalized the economy."
2,Portfolio Strategy Based on only 11 Years of Data,"The book's Total Return Strategy focuses on stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average with increasing dividend payouts. With decades of data on the stocks comprising the Dow Jones Industrial average, the authors recommended Total Return Portfolio Strategy is based on only 11 years of data (1987-1997). This is troubling and raises suspicion that the strategy may not have been as successful in previous years. I would of gladly given this book a high rating if the authors presented data for the Total Return Portfolio for the last 50 years. Instead, I will return this book to Amazon."
4,A Good Read!,"Investing in IPOs describes the process behind taking a private company public in the United States. The book lists the players in an initial public offering and describes the documents that must be filed with securities regulators. It also offers suggestions about what characteristics lead to successful IPOs, such as a history of profits, a strong management team and a lack of strong competition. Also noteworthy are the advance warning signs which point to losers. These signs include pending lawsuits, low-price stock and recently changed business plans. We at ... recommend this book with its exhaustive and useful look at the IPO process to investors and to companies pondering an IPO. This clearly written book includes specific examples that use real-world companies to illustrate points."
5,To WBT or not to WBT,"I am an instructional designer for a software development company in Boston. We have at least four copies of Ms. Driscoll's book in the department. It's given us a common vocabulary and structure for planning our WBT training strategy. It's helping us make decisions on when to use WBT, and which WBT tools we should use for various training programs. Highly recommended."
3,Web-Based Training Dry But Informative,"Web-Based Training is a textbook for corporate training programs delivered via the web. Focusing on the ""training"" in web-based training, Margaret Driscoll delivers an informative and useful guide Web-Based Training covers such topics as advantages of instruction on the web, principles of adult education, the web-based training process, assessing learner needs, and selecting the most appropriate WBT method. The second half of the book offers useful information and worksheets on designing lessons, the difference between asynchronous and synchronous learning, and evaluating programs."
3,Careless Packaging,"Jewelcase arrived broken in multiple spots because CD was so poorly packaged. Fortunately, CD was not cracked."
2,remember this one....,"$..and it contains what is covered in a paperback for less ... elsewhere. A CD with Baroque music is just to give it the 'whizz-bang' feel. More marketing than depth. Look for O'brien, Hancock etc or, for the good ol' days go for Harry Lorayne - one the very early popularisers and it has all the content of this for under half the price."
4,Nine year old granddaughter says....,"My nine year old granddaughter, for whom this was purchased, says it is fun, but a bit difficult. I think she is enjoying it, though. She hasn't been a GameBoy player for very long. She did mention that there were different levels. Her brothers are enjoying it, too. They are not quite as old, but avid gamers."
3,not my favorite.....,"in this game there is 1 level i love and i redo it a lot. the other levels are kinda boring but some are better.the graphics are pretty good i'd recommend this to KP fans.if you have never played a GBA before i don't recommend this 'cause it can be confusing sometimes (with all the gadgets,moves, and stuff)its not the worst, not the best."
5,John Hagee Prophecy Bible,I bought the John Hagee Prophecy Study Bible to understand certain topics. There is tons of info for anyone who wants to study the bible more and to understand God's word when it relates to the Tribulation and the Rapture.
5,Raising The Sparks is Exceptional,"I found that this video not only offered me a new and meaningful perspective on my own (lapsed) Jewish upbringing, but also on the whole of my spiritual thinking. The rabbi interviews were especially meaningful to me--showing me how Judaism is another facet of the Oneness of Spirit. This video is not just for those interested in Judaism, but for all spiritual seekers and seekers of truth, everywhere."
1,Poorly Made Product,"This product was totally disappointing. The directions were difficult to follow, there were only poorly draw diagrams to describe the construction. The product is very flimsy and unstable. I will not use it for the purpose of placing my Paradigm speakers, nor would I purchase this product again or any other product of this type. I have been completely unsatisfied with this product. Finally, during assembly of this product I somehow managed to chip the frosted glass shelves because the rods for the stand came in a somewhat bent manner from the packageThank You."
3,arrived & played ok,arrived & played ok but no really good version of The L:ittle Drummer Boy which is what I was looking for.
3,Only for people who like to laugh and not take eveything too seriously,"Songs by the Jethros are worth the price of admission. They are expert musicians taking unexpected creative liberties with Christmas classics that will leave you laughing right out loud. There is nothing ""anti-Christmas"" about this album at all. If you are throwing a rousing Christmas party, many of these cuts should be playing in the background. A Personal Holiday Message From The Retailers Of America is one of the funniest cuts although (and because) it liberally drops the F-bomb throughout. A must-own Christmas classic for those who wish to balance out all the Bing Crosby and other melancholia in order to totally lighten the holiday mood. Probably best for the young, young at heart and those who feel the Christmas holidays are for parties full of laughter, drinking and shared good times."
5,Buyer's remorse,"I must tell you, I finally decided to pop for these knives as an indulgence; and then I had a bad case of buyer's remorse. You know, ""How in hell could I justify paying 100 bucks for 2 lousy knives?"". I like to cook, but I've been getting by with ""decent"", although relatively inexpensive knives. Anyway, that remorse lasted until I prepared my first meal. My God, what a difference. I can't justify popping for Wusthof for knives you don't use much, but for the ones you find yourself using every day, it's worth it."
5,the best knives!,I bought my son this set for a gift (he has worked in restaurants and attended cooking school and asked for them) and enjoyed using them so much I bought my own. I have owned Chicago cutlery for thirty years. These knives are much sharper and make chopping much easier. I plan to buy additional knives. Well worth the price.
5,Great Knife,"This was my first Wusthof, and not my last. I've been using it for about a month now a could not be happier. It seems to keep it's edge very well and feel great in your hand. I liked it so much I have bought three more Wusthof knives since then and I love all of them."
5,Amazing knife set!,"I work as a chef & got these knives as a birthday gift from my fiance. The chef's knife has an amazing edge, and is heavy duty. I can cut through delicate breads without breaking them up, and carve through tough vegetables with ease. The paring knife has seen little use, but the small things I have used it for (fluting mushrooms, small garnishing work) has proven it's usefulness. I've had them since January, and I haven't needed to take them to a sharpening stone yet. Overall, I'm very happy with these! I highly recommend them.Pros:VersatileProfessional QualityHolds a keen edgeCons:None!"
5,Knife set,"After years of making less expensive knife sets work, we are very happy to finally replace a block set with 3 quality sharp kitchen knives. Items arrived quickly and happy with the change."
1,Nicks on new knife,"We just bought this set and after opening it, I clearly saw one big nick and two smaller nicks on the blade of the 8"" Chef's Knife. This is totally unacceptable of a knife this expensive. This is our first set of knives and this is not a good first impression of this company. The knife is sharp but, I will be returning the set. The pairing knife seemed to be just ok as it was not as sharp as the Chef's Knife but it had no nicks in the blade.We initially bought the Henckel Internation 14 piece knife set but, returned it because one knife started to rust after using it two times. We did hand wash and dry it too. We dicided to go Wusthof because they were supposed to be the best but, now I see that there is spotty quality control at both companies.Is it possible to buy a new product in perfect condition anymore?"
3,"These are good, but try Cutco blades","These are excellent knives with fine craftsmanship and excellent materials, but if you look at cutco the craftsmanship and materials are equal while the design is unique and pure genious."
5,Worked as described,My wife has has been suffering from vaginismus for several years with no help from the Dr. A couple of weeks working with this kit and the problem is much better. Highly recommended!
4,much needed for vaginismus,"I did not receive a CD with mine like shown in the picture which was irritating.. but the book does help. You are always given access to a website to talk to others which is much more helpful than anything else! The dilators are helping and I am moving my way up which is awesome. I can not guarantee you its going to fix it or ""cure it"" but it works for a lot of women and its helping me! IT IS WORTH THE MONEY IF YOU HAVE VAGINISMUS! Its worth doing what you can!"
2,maybe I misread....,"...but this CD did not contain the one march i was looking for. Why was it listed under my search for ""Pomp and Circumstance"" if it did not have that march on the CD?Other than that, it was in good condition and delivered quickly."
5,Peace through poetry,"This book is shocking in its stark retelling of an emotionally brutal childhood. I was drawn in instantly. I found myself holding my breath and staring into the room at the conclusion of a page. I was stunned. The moments of the story have lingered with me. My mind poured over the events. Later even after I had moved on to other thoughts, the emotions lingered under my thoughts, so that I would often pause in the middle of doing tasks. The writer seems to be seeking peace through resurrection and forgiveness."
5,one of my favourites,"Excellent movie depicting a true story of heroin trade in Amsterdam. You get a real life feel of how hard life can be. The Chinese, Vietnamese, Turks, Blacks and Italians are all fighting for a piece of the pie. Not a lot of talking, full of action and a fast moving plot makes this mob movie one not to miss."
4,"Good ""best of"" CD, but nothing more.","This CD does what it says it does: it gives you a brief, excellently recorded overview of the Baroque. But remember, this is just bits and pieces of a great store of music.This CD will whet your appetite. You'll need to buy more, after you've heard the excerts of the great works here."
4,"Although not Uematsu's best, it's still pretty good...","But don't pick this up unless you've played the game all the way through. You wouldn't appreciate the tracks or the emotional impact that comes along with associating a piece of music with a part of the game. It's a great experience if you have the time.In comparison with Nobuo Uematsu's other works, this is good, but it is by far from the best. If you want incredible music, go buy the OST to FF VIII, VII or Chrono Cross. The main theme, Melodies of Life, is constantly pummelled into you in many of the tracks from IX, and the problem is that Melodies of Life isn't very good in the first place.Four CDs, most of which you'll graze through... but still, all die-hard fans should have the soundtracks of the games you play. And if you like this OST, you absolutely MUST get the Piano Tracks for IX and the Plus edition (which contains all the cut scene tracks from IX)."
2,Just not that good,"Ok to start i absolutly did not enjoy FF9,for me it was just ... compared to FF6,7 or even 8. Now going to the music, i can tell that Uematsu really worked hard to make this music and in songs like Vamo'Alla Flamenco show his talent, but theres still a problem whith the CD. When compared to FF8,FF7,and i dare say FF6, it is not as entretaning and there are a lot more usless tracks than the others combined. If more of the songs wouldvebeen good this CD wouldve been worth the buy"
5,Unlike anything else...,"The Final Fantasy IX OST is perhaps the best video game soundtrack ever. From the first track to the last.It includes everything from the opening theme song to Melodies of Life. From the first track to the last, this soundtrack is unlike anything else.Composed by Nobuo Uematsu; famous for composing Final Fantasy I to IX's soundtrack. Nobuo's work is always great, and this game falls under the same patern.If you enjoy Final Fantasy IX or the music, be sure to pick up this masterpeice."
1,Misleading,"The Item I purchased was advertised as the Original soundtrack in good condition. What I got was one disc, not in the proper case, and not the OST but a later and less complete soundtrack."
3,An ok album.,"I bought this album thinking it included all the songs from the game, it didnt. So whoever reviewed this and put the whole list is completely wrong. Some of the best songs on FF9 are not on this album. I cannot complain too much because you can hardly ever find soundtracks for 11 year old games."
3,Pretty Good.,"Overall, this was a good buy. My only complaint was that the piece ""Melodies of Life"" number 22 disc 4 was in Japanese, not English, and this was not made clear. But the rest of the music is good."
1,There is no such record as Riddles by Method Man.,"There is no such record as ""Riddles"" by the artist Method Man. There is a single called ""The Riddler,"" but I am unwilling to purchase this product under the assumption that this is indeed that single."
1,NOT THE RIGHT PRODUCT FOR THIS PRICE,"Only 1 cord of 48 was shipped. This was either mislabeled or misrepresented. DEFINITELY NOT THE RIGHT PRODUCT FOR THIS PRICE!Product Features Case 48 12"" Yellow"
5,Great purchase,"Can't go wrong with a Wusthof. This knife was exactly as promised, brand new, arrived quickly and was a very good price."
5,Excellent,"knife functions as promised by description and by brand legacy.. very sharp, perfect size, would like to add more to my collection in time."
3,meh.,It's nice to have it in the set I'm building. Wustoff shines in the longer knives. This one is pretty run of the mill.
2,Pure CRAP,"I thought spending the extra money on Wusthof would be the ticket for me. They are excellent cutting tools, but the overall quality is truly NO BETTER than any other knife of the same cost. You are paying for the name, which by the way wears off after about 50 hand washings and dryings. For the money you would think they could at least engrave the knife or use paint which does not wear off. Save your money and buy throw away knives. You'll have a new one every year or so."
4,Excellent knife,This is an excellent well built knife. Its the right size to do multiple jobs and it comes sharp right out of the box.
3,A pleasant listening journey,"Voyagers--from Steve Howe/Paul Sutin--was originally released in 1995. The talents of guitarist Howe and keyboardist Sutin combine to make this piece of work a pleasant listening journey. Voyagers consists of ten tracks. The music is in a New Age musical direction. The sound quality is nice. Also, there are no vocals, but there is percussion work. Words to describe this album would be smooth, elegant, serene, soaring, ethereal, and relaxing. There is pretty-sounding keyboard playing throughout. Even though I like all of the pieces, my favorite composition is ""Dreams of Freedom."" ""Dreams of Freedom"" is beautiful and soothing and one of my favorite instrumentals in general. Howe provides tasteful, soaring guitar work on ""Telepathy."" ""Sonar Call"" furnishes keyboarding that is enveloping and graceful. The disc is just over 45 minutes. Actually, I rate Voyagers 3.5 stars. It is a recommendable piece of work."
3,bit slow moving,Have read most of books written by Susan Howatch - found this one too slow.Would continue to choose her books
2,Glittering images....?,"How can any respectable writer use an image like ""glittering images"" possibly as many as 500 times in one book? It's a hokey, overstated image to begin with--who is it that is actually so ""glittering"" in the book in the first place?--and it destroys the meaningfulness of the split personality, or the outer and inner character, the holy and the profane, that is really the subject of the book. It seems to me that Howatch herself is divided--between a writer of somewhat serious intentions and a pulp romanticist. I finished the book because it has its own kind of compulsive readability, but I'll never read another one."
3,Guess I missed something......,"Based on a lot of other glowing reviews here, perhaps it's just me and I've missed something with this novel. I loved Cashelmara by this author and will be re-reading it soon. But this one.....maybe it's just me, but I found it to be extremely slow moving. I love being taken slowly along by an author, but this was just a bit too slow for me.It was definitely well written! So I'd have to say my lack of interest in it has more to do with the very slow pace of the story.....and yes, I cheated. I skimmed to the end.......and even reading the ending, I'm afraid I still wasn't that captured with this book.I guess about all I can honestly say on this one is, ""different strokes for different folks."""
1,Not even readable,"I rarely abandon a book - this was an exception. It was so boring, slow, stilted that I couldn't get even halfway through. The plot (if there was one) took too long to develop, the characters were dull. I do not recommend this book."
5,An excellent read!,"I'm not one for reviews but I must confess that I simply couldn't put this book down! I read it in about two days and it was a wonderful experience. The narrative is rich and compelling, the characters believable and relatable (at least for me since I'm both a christian and a philosophy student). The vocabulary was daunting at first, but the kindle allows one to highlight words and receive definitions so it wasn't too big a deal. If you want an excellent blend of mystery, philosophy, theology, all wrapped up in an engrossing story, then definitely purchase this book!"
3,Perfect Title,"Read this book (with lots of patience) if you are looking to understand your own 'glittering image.' We all seem to have one whether or not we are aware of it.The characters were very well defined. What was not described was easy to fill in with my imagination.The reason I only rated this book a 3 was that it went on and on and on. Even when the story finally became interesting, the same facts were repeated over and over in different ways. Often, I wanted to skip over some of the repetitions but was afraid I would miss some new point so I read every word to the very end. I had to finish this book for understanding only and not for pleasure."
5,First of an excellent series of Church novels,"1937: Charles Ashworth, young charming former Chaplain to Archbishop of Canterbury, Cosmo Lang, is asked to discreetly investigate the private life of the Bishop of Starbridge, Alex Jardine, an aggressive liberal. What he finds seems to horrifingly mirror what lurks in his own private life of hurt, tragedy, and guilt all hidden behind Ashworth's carefully crafted 'Glittering Image'. A brilliant novel about pastoral care and fundamental morality and Christ's grace and redemption."
2,Beware - $9.00 to ship!,"I've used many desoldering wicks before, and I'm sure this is just fine. Just beware - the non-amazon seller is charging $9.00 (!!!!) to ship this product. You'll end up spending ten dollars for a spool of wick.Caveat emptor.Regards,Will"
1,No Go,"It takes to much heat for it to absorb solder. It is thin (width), good for confine space, but you will most likely burn/separate the pad before it actually absorbs the solder. Yes, is that bad."
1,Was the wrong item,"When the bundle box came in the mail; it contained two plastic viles of rosin core solder with Desoldering wick labels and part numbers. It isn't worth sending the two small items back, as I am a contractor in Kuwait, and shipping cost would be more than the two items themselves.""Attention to detail"" when it comes to inventory items is evidently not a priority."
3,Jokemaster Jr. CD,"I bought this for my 8 year old nephew who loves to read, listen to, and tell jokes. He told me he likes it, but I haven't actually seen him listen to it, nor has he shared any jokes from it with me. Thus, 3 stars versus 4."
2,Unabridged 14cd Great beginning then slow to even almost crawling,I love Malaysia been there many times and to so many of the towns that were mentioned so I REALLY WANTED TO LIKE THIS STORY.The beginning was about Johnny Lim. His childhood to his crooked adults years had me fascinated. Worthy of a 5 starThe middle part was more about Johnny Lim's wife her disappointment that Johnny never wanted to make love to her.Her fascination with a Japanese man who spent a lot of time with them. This was slow and not overly interesting. Worthy of a 2 starThe ending was about repeating so many things that were already told in the middle but by Johnny's British friend's memory and views on them. Boring.Worthy of a 1 star.Overall I can't recommend this book even after that brilliant start. It was Tash Aw first novel and his following books hopfully will be more tightly woven together without repeating so many minor plots twice.
5,"Excellent read, a walk down the history of Malaysia","well written maiden novel from Tash Aw. You simply cant put down the book once you start. The novel interweave a mix of local history, relationship and patriotism. In this book, as in real life, no one is truly good or bad. A wonderful read, that will leave you re-visiting your own relationships."
3,Could have been a better book.,"I was tempted to buy it after flipping through the first a few pages in a Borders bookstore. But when I was at the 50th page after my first afternoon Latte, I lost the desire to read on. So there it is. Unfortunately, the book that could have been sitting on my book shelf is still in Borders.Tash Aw experiments a new narration style in this book, which is fascinating. The theme itself is rich and eyecatching. But the characters lack flesh. Watching them unfolding the story is like watching a puppet show. This is the reason I found it hard to read on. This could have been a better book indeed if only the characters were better built, and the backgrounds further explored into. Still for a debut, this is not a bad work at all. I wish Tash Aw would continue to write with confidence and courage."
5,This one is the best!,"I have seen a lot of sailor moon and these two episodes remain two of my all time favorites. Anyone who is even a little interested in the series should see this, scratch that, EVERYONE should see this! This is quality entertainment!"
5,The Best Sailor Moon has to Offer,"Secret Identities, is by far the best tape available in the Sailor Moon series. It has a great storyline, with the introduction of Sailor V and the true identities of Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask. Add this to great animation, and a killer soundtrack, and this is easily the best there is out there, for a Sailor Moon fan, or an Anime fan in general."
1,A great anime once again hits the dust.,"Bishoujo Senshi Sailormoon has been so mutilated in DiC's inept hands that its barely reconizable. The voice acting is so bad that I nearly burst out laughing at the climax! Watching this violated anime, my advice to you is BUY ONLY UNEDITED, UNCUT, SUBTITLED VERSIONS! As far as I know, the only thing in english that fits that description are the soon-to-be released Sailormoon R, S, and SS video versions, or (semi-legal) fansubs. Or you could buy the english translated manga, which, though it still uses the dreadful dub names, is a big step up from DiC. Good luck."
5,Oh It's So Way Wicked Cool! ^.~,"If you're a fan of the Sailor Senshi, you're gonna love this one! These episodes are really the most important and heartfelt of the entire first season! You're just gonna love the way Serena and Darien remember their past and unite their future! Watch and see how they start their new relationship together paving the way for Crystal Tokyo! /(=^.^=)\"
1,"If you think this is good, see the original!","I have seen all the dub episodes, but in my mind nothing can compare to the original. It isn't a cartoon, it's ANIME. ANIME! To fully appreciate the series, you really need to see it in the original Japanese with English subtitles. If you can't afford subs, then find websites that have episode synopses to learn what this show is all about. Never heard of Usagi? Want to know who Sailor Chibi-moon is? Check out the original and compare to the dub. You'll be thankful you do!"
5,Sailor Moon Rules All!!!!!!,"This movie was great, if you didn't like it, YOU'RE CRAZY!!!!!!!!! Sailor Moon is the coolest show in the universe! I liked it alot, even though it is not my favorite Sailor Moon Movie. I think if you watch it, you'll learn to like it too, even if it has somecut out parts!"
3,semi disappointing,"Not much point in watching this other than the soft core content. The girls are attractive, the guys are not. The plot is almost nonexistant and has logical holes you could drive a truck through. There is no doubt but that this was done on a low budget and the clarity and quality of the film image reminds me of something that might have been done in the late 1960's. All of that being said, if you are in the market for soft core that you can get for a bargain price this might be something you would want. The girls are worth the cover charge."
1,Don't waste your time !,"This could have been a very interesting travel narrative.I really tried to make it work, but gave up reading it after about 80 pages.It is just very poorly written. Long rambling sentences and strange word usage make for a strange and confusing jumble that will leave you with a headache.There are far better biker stories out there. Do yourself a favor and skip this one."
1,Soccer skills video,Do not waste the money. You can do better from a book. Poorly done and the hype of the video was not up to the performance.
1,Unavailable books are very hard to read,I found this book very difficult to read due to it's unavailablity. I did find it refreshing though that when not reading the book I was never confused as to the terminolgy being used or the meaning of phrases or comments. I reccomend this book to computer users without access to a computer or illiterate people.
1,What a shame....,"GoLive has made a pretty amazing piece of software. It's unfortunate that their documentation is so terrible. I came to Shelly Brisbin's QuickStart Guide hoping it would give me some new insight into the app. Major disappointment!It seems to me that the author was content to simply distill down the manual that came with CyberStudio. She doesn't say anything new. In fact, some sections of her book seemed lifted right out of the manual.Bummer."
1,Common book about a poor pi,"This book is a decent overview of a promising, but actually average piece of software. I was intrigued by CyberStudio's apparent WYSIWYG approach, thinking it would be an improvement on NetObjects' Fusion. But I was sadly disappointed. Don't waste your time with the book or the software. I've since moved to NetObjects' Fusion and am much happier. The Dan Shafer book or the Stell Gassaway book on that software are both good"
2,"Broad topic, shallow coverage","I have tried to teach a course on embedded systems using this book. While the effort of the author has to be honoured to cover such a wide range of topics, practically all topics are treated in a rather shallow way, and some information, for instance on UML notation, is wrong. To get an overview, the book is too big; to get into any of the topics in a serious fashion the book is not big enough."
2,Misrepresentation,"This book is listed on Amazon as being published in September of 2007 . Actually, the book was originally published in 1954. As the daughter of the author, I was startled to find it listed as new. I have contacted both the new publisher and Amazon, so far without results. Unless you want a 53 year old book for historical purposes, I highly recommend you avoid purchase."
1,My Estonian Teacher Says This Is Not Worth Your Money,"My Estonian Language teacher hates this book, I would follow her advice. Your first clue should be the Russian domes on the cover. No native Estonian would dare put this on their cover. Think about it. Try E Nagu Eesti."
3,"Good, but only in conjunction with a real grammar","This series has some problems, including the occasional typo, lack of grammatical explanations and generally loose editing, but as a companion to more antiquated but grammatically rich texts available for English speakers (such as Tuldava's Estonian Textbook), this series provides a nice set of colloquial updates for those tackling Estonian."
3,Not the first!,"Ignore the stars, I have not seen the book, but want to point out that it is not the first resource in English on Estonian, as the editorial review claims. For example, there is Basic Course in Estonian by Felix J. Oinas (Indiana Univ. Uralic & Altaic Series, vol. 54) which has been around at least since 1968."
2,There are better Estonian courses on the market,"I wouldn't really recommend this book to anyone. It is one of the shortest of all the courses in the Colloquial series. Given the fact that English is more closely related to almost any European languages that to Estonian, this book never stands a chance of teaching you Estonian. Parts of the pronunciation. especially concerning the difference between -b, d, g- , -p, t, k- and -pp, tt, kk, is never explained despite being crucial to the grammar of Estonian. Get this one wrong and you won't be understod. Due to the shortness of the book, the vocabulary you'll learn is not that extensive and the grammar explanations are too short for you to get a real understanding of Estonian grammar. As one of the best language courses in any language, the Estonian Textbook by Juhan Tuldava, is also available from Amazon, I would definiely recommend you to consider buying that course instead of this one."
1,Nonsense,"I am very upset with this book and especially with the cassettes, these are not even native estonian speakers!!! I was listening to some dialogues and they make stupid grammatical mistakes in very simple sentences.If anybody can study from this book, I admire these people a lot!!!Any estonian national would be offended by the image that this book gives to the beautiful estonian language.My Greek boyfriend says: olete jobud!!!"
4,First Experiences with Estonian,"YEEEOWWW!!!! Can we say complicated, kids?! For my first visit to Estonia, I purchased this book with an intention to acquire a ""get-by"" knowledge of her language, and little did I know I was in for such a treat... The book does a good job in explaining the basics, but I really think that they try to cram too much into too little space. The first few chapters are straightforward, but require much revision to obtain a basic working knowledge of the language. After the beginning chapters, the content FLIES by and there is even more studiousness required to keep up, as more and more of the language and its inherent complexities becomes exposed. BEWARE, this language is not for the faint of heart. :) All in all, the book is very thorough and quite informative with regard to both grammar and vocabulary. The tapes are EXCELLENT, being both clear and varied in voice type."
4,Guys with Guns and the Women Who Love Them,"Effective diatribe about an aimless sharpshooter who falls in with the wrong woman, who naturally leads him down the path of no good. John Dall and Peggy Cummins make an effective pairing as the outlaws on the run. My only qualm is that given the constraints of the production code in 1949, we can easily predict their inevitable outcome. Imagine how much better the film could have been if the producers of this film had the liberties that the makers of ""Bonnie and Clyde"" did in 1967. Good black-and-white photography and location work are on hand here."
3,Best for it's cinematography and the bank robbery scene....,"I found the the cinematography and direction to be extraordinary and well above average for noir, however, when compared to the the best film noir, the acting/casting and the weak script keep this one from being a true lost classic. Check out Born Killer, Detour, or Pickup on South Street first.Also, the bank robbery scene shot entirely from the backseat of the getaway car is everything it's cracked up to be, and then some!! Mr. Tarantino has certainly been here robbing some bones...."
3,Gun Crazy,I had heard a lot about this movie but after watching it I wonder what all the fuss is about. The characters were not quite believable as hoodlums and I lost interest it them about half way into the movie at about the same time the movie should have been ending.
2,Underwhelming,"I also didn't love the smell. I didn't even like it. I'm disappointed by this. As far as being a deodorant, sure, it works like anything else."
1,Nope,"No sir, didn't like it.The smell is almost medicinal and it leaves this weird sticky residue that flakes up after it dries up, thus giving you underarm the appearance of having dandruff.---- SmellI would give this Zero stars, but Amazon is not willing to comply with my harsh judgement."
5,The Absolutely BEST paring knife!,"Great knife! I have used it every day since I received it from Amazon. Perfect size, perfect weight and thus far still extremely sharp. A real bargain compared to others I have purchased before!"
5,Old fashioned paring knife,"Bought this knife to replace one I lost....along with the less expensive 3"". Love them both and just hope I hang on to them...."
5,The difference between good enough and outstanding.,"Having already owned two of the larger Wustof Classic knives it wasn't a difficult decision to buy this one when the price came down to $29.After buying some hard beets at the farmers market I grabbed a knife from a good enough set, took one slice then remembered this new knife was in the drawer. The difference in slicing between a good enough knife and this one was the difference between good enough and outstanding."
3,KNIFE WILL BEND,"Its a great knife, did not break, but it did bend, on the knife end.I have had for 2 years."
4,excellent paring knife,there is no substitute for a high quality sharp paring knife. this one works well at 3 1/2 inches. I also purchase a henckles 4 inch paring same time. use both
4,Knife problem,"I bought this knife a couple months ago and it cuts beautifully.I wash all my knives by hand. Today...the handle cracked and it's useless. In all my years of cooking, I've never had a handle break. Pretty surprised that it happened to a reputable brand. Wish they would replace it."
5,Wusthof Paring Knife,Love this knife! It fits the hand perfectly and is easy to sharpen. It is the only paring knife I reach for--and I have 5.
5,Great Wusthof customer service!,"Over the years, I managed to ruin the edge on my beloved Wusthof paring knife by using one of those cheap ""easy to use"" sharpening gizmos. I sent it to Wusthof's sharpening service, asking them to try their best to regrind the edge.I received back a brand new knife! Needless to say, I'll be a lifetime Wusthof customer. I've also invested in a proper knife sharpening system!"
4,Genki = Full of Awesome,"I have been a huge fan of Genki since his days in Pancrase. I was disappointed to hear that he completely retired from MMA. After watching this video it does shed light on why he did.He gives perspective on his life, and his philosophy on MMA, life, etc. To top it all off it shows highlights of his fights throughout his career. The one thing it does lack are his matches from the UFC. I am sure that he would have to pay some type of money to using his own fight footage.If you are a Genki fan and have always wondered what goes on in the Neo Samurai's head then you will love this video."
5,Precious,When this movie first came out we went to the theatre to see it. It was precious and entertaining then it still is today.
5,Classic Movie,This is a family classic that everyone in our family enjoyed! The music in the movie was very good too.
3,Good boot,"It's a well-made boot. I think it could use a little more cushioning - it feels like you're standing on a block of wood. Also, I think it looks a little better in the picture than it up close - the leather has an unusual texture to it.But overall, it's a well made boot, and I expect it to last a long time."
1,Dr. Martens are not what they used to be,"These shoes lasted me only three months. I only wore the shoes on weekends for a couple of hours at a time. I will never buy Dr. Martens again. They used to be a good product, but now, they are just cheaply made."
1,HOW TO WIN AT GREYHOUND BETTING,"THIS BOOK IS FOR ENGLAND DOG RACING,NOT THE U.S.A.IT'S NO GOOD WHAT SO EVER HERE. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE.PLEASE INFORM PEOPLE THAT IT IS WRITTEN FOR SALE IN ENGLAND.THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIMEDENNIS WELCH"
4,Sci Fi Fun,Who doesn't like a sci fi flick? I think that the anti christ stuff and the rapture stuff is interesting twist. It's well acted and has some spooky moments.
2,Excellent advice if you live in the United States,"I enjoyed some of the information, but I had been spoiled by reading The Tightwad Gazette first, mostly because her information is excellent no matter where you live, whereas Mike Yorkey's information is mostly directed to American stores. That I found very disappointing. This book was good, but I enjoyed The Tightwad Gazette (III) much better, mostly because I am a stay at home mom and was interested in the advice Amy had to offer. If you live in the States, and can take advantage of his information on store sales, then you will find this helpful. If you live anywhere else, save your money and get the Tightwad Gazette. He also gave tips on where to eat in restaurants to save money, but if you are truly trying to be frugal, restaurants are not an option. Again, not a lot of info on the home itself, a lot on insurance, investing, travel, medicare,coupons and warehouse clubs(in the U.S.)"
5,Beautiful Timepiece,"Received watch recently; the photos don't do it justice. It is large, but the unique shape makes is very distinctive. The instructions are very clear on how to calibrate the chronograph function and how to use the stop watch. So far I am very pleased with this watch."
2,Help Wanted: Editor,"I enthusiastically obtained this book, and truly, there is some good information in it. I think. The problem is that the typos absorbed my concentration and it took all my energy not to reach for the red pen. This book reads as though it went from concept to press in two weeks.I couldn't trust the accuracy of this book because if it wasn't edited, is it likely to have been fact checked? Some of the errors are silly, some are grievous. The point is, I read 2 chapters before flinging it aside, and I only read the second chapter out of fascination for the train wreck of typos: at least one per page, no less.I gave it two stars since as I noted above, I think there might be some good info in it, but I'd double check before I acted on any of it."
1,What the heck?,Ok first off the author isnt even a nurse. She has her masters in reading... her bachelors is in elementary education or something. Makes you wonder how she got information on becoming a nurse. I'd say there are plenty of other books out there that were written by actual nurses that would be alot more helpful than this book. I didnt really notice too many grammatical errors but that is because I cant get past the fact that my girlfriend spent $17 on a useless book...
3,okay,"i got this book. it did introduce aspects of nursing that i had not really considered. the biggest downside to this book is the spelling and grammatical errors. i don't so much blame the author, as much as i blame the editor. how did these huge errors get past an editor??"
2,poor writing!,"By the time I reached Chapter 3, I had encountered at least four typos. It makes me question the authenticity of this author's research. If THIS many grammatical errors were allowed to make print, I can only imagine how little time and effort the author/editor put into the creation of this book. And to continue with what someone else said, this author is not even a nurse.If you are going to spend money on a book about nursing, do not buy this book. Find an author who has more hands-on experience in the field. I found most of the information in this book to be vague, or easily obtainable with a little internet research. Very disappointing."
4,A pretty good collection of Foreingers biggest hits,"The Very Best and Beyond collects more hits than Foreinger's previous hits complation Records,which had a skimpy 10 songs.The Very Best and Beyond covers Foreigner's career up to 1992,they've only had one new studio album since this complation was released.The Collection Starts out with three new songs,then we are left with 14 hits.Besides most of the songs from Records we have Say You Will,That Was Yesterday,I Want to Know What Love is, and the album track Rev on the Red Line.While hits complations always lack personal favorites The Very Best and Beyond delivers with the exception of Rev on the Red Line,don't think I've ever heard it on the radio,Blue Morning Blue Day was a minor hit and would have been a better choice, other than that The Very Best and Beyond is a fine introduction to 70's supergroup Foreigner."
4,Missing a couple songs I wanted,"Overall this is a good collection of Foreigner's hits but it's missing two songs that I wanted, Long Long Way From Home and Blue Morning Blue Day, and a couple of others like Break it Up (which entered the Top 30 charts in 1982) and Women (which nearly missed the Top 40 in early 1980). I wouldn't recommend this CD unless if you want the 3 new Foreigner songs like Soul Doctor, Prisoner of Love and With Heaven on our Side, fortunately the songs are unedited unlike the other compilations which is the reason why this CD gets 4 stars, where else would you find unedited versions of Double Vision, Waiting For a Girl Like You, Feels Like the First Time, Urgent and I Don't Want to Live Without You?"
5,Now I remember why I liked these guys,"Wow! How many of these songs were the backdrop of our lives from 1979 through the early 90's? Rock solid songwriting, instrumental work that you felt in your gut, and Lou Gramm's incredible voice. What more could we have asked for. I still think ""Urgent"" could qualify as my generation's ""Bolero"" in terms of accompaniment to seduction. Romantic? No. Hot and hard when you needed it? Oh, yeah!"
4,good disc,this disc has all the essential material by Foreigner that you will ever need.Urigent still sounds great today.also i want to know what love is solid.a good disc.
4,A pretty decent radio-friendly rock collection!,"Foreigner, so named because there are both Americans and Britons in the band, have always, to me, had a talent for creating and releasing upbeat rock numbers, either fast or slow. The first three tracks on this album were new from 1992, and I like ""Soul Doctor"" the best from them. My two absolute favorites are ""Urgent"" and ""Say You Will"", but I also like ""Jukebox Hero"", ""Cold As Ice"", and ""Double Vision"". As for the three slow ballads ""Waiting For A Girl Like You"", ""I Want To Know What Love Is"", and ""I Don't Wanna Live Without You"", I've got to be in just the right relaxed mood to enjoy them the most. So, this compilation is quite cool, the very best of Foreigner is indeed here!"
3,Slightly Dated,"I bought this album when it first came out, having been a casual Foreigner fan. Every now and again, it's good to bust out some mindless rock just to let off some steam and this album works well for that. All of Foreigner's hits are here in one place and I enjoyed the newer songs ""soul Doctor"" and ""Prisoner of Love"", while ""With Heaven on Our Side"" receives a ""meh"". One thing that struck me on recently listening is how dated a lot of the production sounds to me. It's got a very glossy sheen to it, unlike the more organic sounding recordings that I seem to enjoy these days. But that's really just a personal preference. The songs are good for what they are, which is AOR rock. Foreigner were about as deep as a teaspoon even in their heyday, as shown by their lyrics. Still, they were good at writing catchy, if simplistic tunes. I would file this one under guilty pleasures."
