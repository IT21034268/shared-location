3,An okey budget wine tower,"The base of the product is fairly sturdy and looks decent. At this price point you can't really expect precision engineering at the manufacturing so I would expect a wide range of variation in customer satisfaction. I had to widen a notch in the wine-cubbies for the boards to slide together with a hack saw, and the top doesn't seat 100% flush with the bottom giving it a slightly janky look. The back of the wine storage area is a thin piece of particle board which is packaged near the outside of the box and mine appeared with a gouge and crack on the edge which I was able to work around. Overall an okay piece of furniture for graduate students or others on a budget, but if you can afford something nicer I would probably go with that instead."
3,"Worth the money, but not great.",Everything is fine and very easy to put it together. Color is darker that the picture. and the design has defects.
2,Poorly made,Poorly made and difficult to put together. Would not recommend this item. Not worth the money or time spent putting together.
3,You pay for what you get,"Nice looking wine rack, but it doesn't feel particularly sturdy. Also, the drawer falls out when I try to open it. I'll need to add a wider track for it to work properly."
3,3 stars,"lil bumppy a lil scratch but weak but ok the price was good and it is a pretty item, looks geed with the rest of my btrown and bedige funiture."
5,Dustin understands why Windows admins would use Linux,"I just love the walkthroughs. For Windows admins this is like an eye opener. Like anybody else I needed to understand how I could use Linux to share files, printers, do remote admin, etc... Excellent descriptions of bash, samba, MySql, PHP and Apache. Concise, to the point, allowing me a quick start with hints where to further each project. Dustin's approach is to offer real life examples of how to install and use Linux applications. He covers every basic aspect of the Linux system. My recommendation is to buy the book, install Linux and proceed page by page in the exact order of his book chapters and try everything. At the end of the book you will know a little bit of everything."
3,Well...,"Maurice is beautifully, insightfully written, and far ahead of its time. No one can argue with that. It's also a quick, engaging read. But I don't believe that it deserves all the praise that's being heaped on it. E.M. Forster purposely makes all his characters as unlikeable as possible. He states over and over again that Maurice is stupid, unremarkable, and mediocre until I wanted to scream ""Why are you being so cruel to your own creation!?!"" It's one thing to give your protagonist flaws, but it's quite another to degrade him every time he enters a scene. Clive is a pretentious fop who decides to become straight for no particular reason, and Alec isn't given any personality whatsoever. As hard as I tried, I couldn't really sympathize with any of these people. This book makes me so mad simply because it had the potential to be so much better."
2,Buy the Penguin edition instead,Buy the Penguin edition instead. This copy by W.W. Norton is more expensive and has no explanatory notes. I am very sorry to not have purchased the Penguin edition.
4,Good book,"** Possible Spoiler **The tale is bittersweet at best. It's a tale of love between two men when homosexuality was against the law in England. Written in 1917 and not published until 1970, I first watched the movie adaptation which sprung my interest in reading the book.Maurice is a great complex character and I liked the way he evolved to accept his sexuality. Clive comes across as a jerk for most of the book, especially when he claims to no longer love Maurice since he's turned back to women.Maurice does get his happy ending such as it is. It's too bad there wasn't a sequel to this book. I would like to have read about Maurice and his new love, Scudder."
4,Happy Endings Are Good,"A wounderfull book, it made me feel happy and then angry, and sad, and then happy again. I cant stand a book with an unhappy ending, so this book is a good book for people like me."
1,Horrid!!,"I have purchased this and to my grave dissapointemnt this product does not work. The customer service is rude, sarcastic and not helpful. The most awful experience I have had while buying from these people.Beware and do not give them your money! Products doesnt work and returns are a hassle!!! The shaver works so slowly and badly that I wouldnt even try to return it anymore, it belongs in the trash, not here for sale"
3,Not bad...,Not to shabby of a fabric shaver. As one other reviewer noted you need to slip off the cover and depth adjustable cap...it simply does not work with it in place.You also need to give the batteries a good 6 hours to charge. The shaver doesn't work with the power cord attached...that's only for charging the batteries.
3,OK shaver,"Best fabric shaver I have found yet, but still not good enough. Its storage its too small, you have to take the black cover off so it works, otherwise its good for nothing. It also takes a long time shaving to get a really good result."
3,Works pretty good,Much better than the battery operated kind. But you do have to take off the retractable guide to get any results. It then does a good job of shaving off the sweater fuzz.
4,very practical,I bought this for my sister to use and she is very happy with the practicallity and easy function of it.
1,awful product,"Shaver worked great for the 5 minutes I played with it before plugging it in to fully charge. After the charge cycle was complete, the device won't even turn on. Worst $20 I've ever spent."
2,Dissapointed,"Leave it to the C@#$%&* TO F@#* up what used to be a very practical and innovative little gadget that was nice to own. What we can make in 3 parts, it takes them 25, 20 which are unnecessary. After the initial charging and dis-assembling some of the unnecessary parts, I was able to use it and it did do a decent job. The lint chamber is pretty small. I gave this product 2 stars. Not recommended for the impatient!"
1,Waste of money,I bought this shaver about a year ago. I have never been able to get it to work properly. I took it out again this season and tried to recharge it--it still does not work. Don't buy this product.
5,A Remastered Classic!,"One of the best, (if not THE best), works of the late Bon Scott era of AC/DC, this CD continues the beat in the line of albums including ""Let There Be Rock"", ""Powerage"", and ""High Voltage"". A five star classic, the highlight of course is ""Highway to Hell"" a major staple in all AC/DC Concerts. I just saw my fourth AC/DC concert , and this number brought the house DOWN.The other concert fav is ""Shot Down in Flames"", another classic AC/DC cut. Other major cuts include ""Girls Got Rhythm"" AND ""If You Want Blood (You've Got It)"", the last also the title of their first ""live"" album.This is pure AC/DC at there best. With the pedigree of this band, (Vanda/Young productions, the older brother of the the AC/DC guitarists were members of the EASYBEAT's (""Friday on my Mind""), you can't go wrong with this classic album of the 70's.With the clone rock of this generation, its nice to see some of the originators still sell out.A good buy!"
5,Another Blast From the Past,My brother is such a fan of AC/DC and this CD was one of their most popular. My brother will be excited to have this in his collection.
4,Rock & Roll by one of Best Bands in the World,"Highway to Hell and Shot Down in Flames are the two songs I bought this CD (album) for. The rest of the music is all right, but those are the two gems. You can't get them on MP3 music, so this was the only way I could down load them on my ipod This is good old fashioned rock and roll, no more, no less. Enjoy!"
1,VERY BAD MUSIC,"did the singer get drunk yet? Anyways AC/DC are one of the worst bands ever. the singer don't know his name just screams. The lyrics are dumb, the music is simple, noisy, and boring they'rejust another overrated rock band that needed to quit right afterthe release of the first album.buy these albums insted.green day american idiotdire straits love over goldguns n' roses greatest hitsdon't waste your money cause the only good song is highway to hell."
1,"Green Day is over, AC/DC too!!!","Come on now!! People need to shut up with Green Day. Green Day are the most overrated band of the world. The poplar bands are overrated. Gimme a break!!!!!!!Highway to Hell is one of the worst albums besides Back In Black.Their lead singer Bon Scott is angry, overrated, stupid, lousy, mean, and lame and he sure can't sing. They only made 1 listenable track in the title track of this album. Avoidthe rest of the AC/DC albums and get Metallica insted."
1,junk,"did the singer get drunk yet? Anyways, AC/DC are one of the worst bands ever. The singer don't know his name just screams,the lyrics are dumb, and the music is simple, noisy, & boringthey're just another overrated rock band that needed to quit right after the release of the first album. buy these albumsinsted.green day american idiotdire straits love over goldguns n' roses greatest hitsdon't waste your money cause the only good song is highway tohell."
1,Most boring band in history!,"I think I'll go with the previous 1 star reviewer, Waiting. AC/DCare one of the worst most boring lousiest bands of all time. Theyare even worse than Nirvana and have no talent. This album only has 1 good song in the title track. Rest of the other songs are really, really awful. Avoid this lousy album at all costs along with Back in Blacka and get On Every Street from Dire Straits insted."
5,BEST ALBUM IN ROCKNROLL HISTORY,"AS A FAN OF AC/DC, I MUST REVIWE THIS BECAUSE IT IS THERE BEST ALBUM OF THE BONSCOTT ERA,AND OF ALL TIME.BON SIMPLY KICK'S @SS ON THIS AND IT IS A MUST ANY FAN.MY FAVIORITES INCLUDE HIGHWAYTOHELL,TOUCHTOOMUCH,SHOTDOWNINFLAMES, BEATINGAROUNDTHEBUSH AND IFYOUWANTBLOOD[YOUGOTIT]. IF I COULD ONY HAVE ONE OUT OF ALL THE CD'S AND CASSETTE'S IN MY COLLECTION COMPOSED OF AC/DC [OF COURES]METTALICA,MOTORHEAD THIS ALBUM WOULD BE IT. I THINK ALL AC/DC ALBUMS ARE THEBEST AND WILL NEVER GET TIRED OF THEM,BUT THIS ONE REELY SHINE'S SOMETIMES PEOPEL THINK I'M CRAZY WHEN I DO BONSCOTT AND BRAINJONHSON IMPPESSIONS WHEN I SING SUCH SONGS AS TNT,HIGHWAYTOHELL,HELL'S BELL,S,BACKINBLACK,OR RIDEON.THIS ALBUM IS THE BEST AC/DC HAS EVER RELESED ANDITWILL REMAIN MY FAVIROITE.NO ONE CAN MATCH UP TO HIGHWAYTOHELL THAT'S WHY I THINK THIS IS THE BEST IN ROCKNROLL HISTORY. AC/DC RULES. THANK YOU BON,FOR SUCH AN AWSOME BAND."
5,THIS GREAT ALBUM DESERVES A BILLION STARS,HIGHWAY TO HELL IS A TERRIFIC ALBUM.NO AMOUNT OF STARS IS ENOUGH TO GIVE THIS ALBUM WHICH IS ONE OF THE GREATEST ROCK ALBUM OF ALL TIME.EACH SONG IS FANTASTIC AND THIS IS ONE ALBUM WHICH WOULD BE THEIRE IN EVERY ROCK FANS COLLECTION.VERY VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.PS:PLEASE IGNORE THE PREVIOUS ONE STAR REVIEWER JUKE BOX HERO A.K.A WHIRLIGIG AND AVOID THE LOUSY FOREIGNER 4 ALBUM AT ALL COSTS.
4,AC/DC.,"AC/DC is definitely not the Greatest Rock 'N' Roll Band, but AC/DC is certainly better than crappy Bands like Green Day. Those who believe that Green Day is a better band than AC/DC are Ignorant Morons."
5,superb,"I just love AC/DC.I really think that they are one of the best bands in the world both with Bon Scott and with Brian johnson.Each and every song is superb,so dont waste your time reading my review,buy this album today for your collection.Very highly recommended.Five stars.PS:PLEASE IGNORE THE PREVIOUS ONE STAR REVIEWER AND HIS RECOMMENDATIONS."
5,great CD,"the last good AC/DC album. last one with Bon Scott, who drank too much and ended up drowning in his own sick in 1980"
5,Highway To Hell,"THIS IS ROCK AT IT`S BEST!!WHEN WE LOST RONALD BELFORD SCOTT WE LOST THE GOOD AC/DC!! ROCK IN PEACE BROTHER ""BON"" WE LUV YA!!!!"
5,"Dont listen to the one star reviewers,this album is terrific","AC/DC were amongst the greatest bands to emerge in the seventies.Highway to hell is one of the greatest hard rock albums and is their best along with LET THERE BE ROCK,HIGH VOLTAGE and BACK IN BLACK.This superb album boasts of a number of classics in GIRLS GOT RYTHM,WALK ALL OVER YOU and HIGHWAY TO HELL.Very very very highly recommended.Get all the above mentioned AC/DC albums.Please ignore the one star reviews for this masterpiece and avoid trash like green day and nirvana."
5,This Album Rocks,"Ac/Dc Goes Off on this Classic.This is One Of MY favorites By Them.Bon Scott Never Lets Up with The Grooves.The Title Cut,Night Prowler&Shot Down In Flames are The Cuts."
5,Highway To Hell,Forget Back In Black. Get this. Bon Scott is a superior vocalist to Brian Johnson. Highway To Hell destroys Back In Black in everyway way possible. Fave songs are.Highway To HellGirls Got RythmA Touch too MuchBuy it
4,US Breakthrough,"""H.T.H"" is Bon Scot's swan song and the band's commercial breakthrough in the U.S. Several tracks went on to become hard rock classics, much like the CD itself. It has a cleaner, clearer sound courtesy of major league producer extrodinare Mutt Lange, which helped break it stateside no doubt.While a good hard rock release, it does contain a fair amount of dross..making it closer to ""High Voltage"" than the very solid ""Let There Be Rock"". Even still, it's head and shoulders above other band's offerings in the same genre at the time.AC/DC ruled hard rock in the Bon Scott era (and even for a couple of years afterwards) ""H.T.H."" goes a long way towards explaining why."
4,Polished sheen subtracts from AC/DC's fury,"Most consider either Highway to Hell or Back In Black to be AC/DC's greatest album; what keeps Back In Black from being #1 is that it simply doesn't have Bon Scott as the vocalist. Though Highway to Hell is considered by many to be Bon's greatest vocal and lyrical achievement, Mutt Lange's polished production actually detracts from the unbridled fury of previous AC/DC albums. Dirty Deeds and '74 Jailbreak aside (as they were released in the U.S. following Bon's untimely death), I personally consider Let There Be Rock and Powerage as AC/DC's absolute best. Both are fun, fast and furious examples of early Vanda & Young productions and can be listened to in awe all the way through. And with Highway to Hell being a close third --- never forget who was the soul of AC/DC: Bon. (R.I.P.)"
5,"5 stars, hands down...","I've been listening to this record since 1979 and it sounds just as good in 2004 -if not better compared to some of the pallid garbage out nowadays- as it did then. The songwriting, playing, recording, and mastering unveil the truth about this band and where they were in 1979. A true R&R masterpiece."
5,What Can You Say About this Album,"The ULTIMATE rock album. More or less the album that put the nail in disco's coffin. Those of us who needed a new power rock band in the late 70's got it with HTH. This album will run up your blood pressure and make you want to go wild. Always put this album on when I used to get ready to go out to party worked just right. Now older but stills gets me going again! Few albums in rock stand out over the years and this is one of them for sure. To bad we lost Bon Scott so early on. Brian Johnson a good replacement for sure, but Bon is the one. An album misunderstood by the title but so good on the music and every song is a keeper. If your a AC/DC fan this is the must have to your collection even more so than Back in Black which is a good album. HTH in the car full blast on a sunny day nothing could be better !!!"
5,One of AC/DC's best...,"My rating is about the music itself, I think it's one of AC/DC's best albums and I was already familiar with it. However the purchased cd wouldn't play in my MacPro cd/dvd drive - it would load but get ejected shortly thereafter. After a thorough check, also with other cds in my possession, it turned out not to be an issue with my laptop and cd-dvd drive, so I returned the cd."
3,my review,"this was the perfect way for Bon to go(R.I.P Bon we all miss you) Highway ton hell is a hard rock masterpiece especially with songs such as the title track ""Girls got rhythm"" ""touch too much"" ""shotn down in flames"" and the 6 minute plus ""night prowler"" which later gained controversy linking the song to a murder suspect this album is defintly one of my favorite classic rock almbums i just wish bon wouldnt have died so we could see how much further he could have taken it."
3,rock the highway,"This album rocks the highway like crazy! Highway to Hell is oneamazing track with great riffs and vocals. If you have the money,buy this album just for that song."
3,good album by possibly the greatest party rock band,"If I was to pick one AC/DC album to represent the band, I'd have to go with BACK IN BLACK. However, this album is pretty good - and easily the best of the rest of their catalog. DIRTY DEEDS... comes in a close third.On a personal note: Angus Young's school boy uniform was classic in the 70's and early '80s (remember those 9,000 issues of HIT PARADER with that on the cover?), but ENOUGH already, ANGUS! You are 47 years old - nearly as old as that worn out schtick itself. Will hardcore AC/DC fans really be turned off if you dress like the rest of the band for once?"
1,"1 STAR, BON SCOTT SUCKS.","I wish this angry singer can act nicer just like Lou Gramm, and Mark Knopfler. His name is Bon Scott and he just screams. Highwayto Hell has to be one of the lousiest albums ever created by one of the lousiest bands of all time. Every album sucks from this horrible band so stay away. Buy the Foreigner 4 CD insted."
5,bon scott was the man,i have always loved this cd. i have always been partial to the bon scott era and this cd is the best i think. the saddest thing about this is that i think bon scott was just beginning to discover his talent by then. his writing contributions on this album are the best he ever did and i always wondered how things would have turned out if he had survived. i also admire the way the band carried on when he died because he was the patriarch of the band. the young brothers and the others always looked up to bon for guidance and i think bon would be proud of them for carrying on after his passing. his music will live forever.
5,AC/DC at their finest,"Highway to hell remains my favourite heavy metal album along with paranoid from black sabbath.This masterpiece contains anthems like highway to hell,if you want blood you got it.If you dont have it,get it today.Please ignore the one star reviews and get this classic today."
1,Awesome Album Ruined by Loudness War,"""The Sound on this cd is SO much louder than the original"" ""This has got to be the best this album has ever sounded"" Yeah, right. Highway to hell is one of the latest victims of the loudness war, and this cd is compressed to death. Clipping is evident and the sound is consistently grating. Too bad increases in technology mean worse sounding cds. Pick up the orginal Atlantic cd - its much more dynamic - and consequently better sounding. And to those who say older cds are mastered not as loudly as todays - yeah, that's the point - more dynamic range. If it's not loud enough, guess what? All you have to do is turn up the volume. Best AC/DC album ruined by HORRIBLE mastering"
5,"A straight 10, if possible!","[excerpted from a 1999 radio show by Joanne]You take all of the AC/DC albums ever recorded and released and none of them will show the band at their best than this album. Highway To Hell is not only one of AC/DC's best, but it also stands as one of the greatest rock albums ever released. So much in fact, that today I can't hear a single dated song that shows the bands time of peak.This was the perfect opus to Bon Scott's destructive lifestyle that ultimately took him away from us. And where would the world be had Bon survived? Certianly not on the levels of Highway To Hell.And where most bands are looking for their ultimate classic masterpiece (in the vein of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band) AC/DC found it here on 1979's Highway To Hell."
1,The final album with Bon.,This was AC/DC's most popular album w. Bon Scott. It has a few decent licks but other then that isn't as good as previous or later releases.
1,"Not enough vocals, too little substance","My review of this album is really quite simple...There are ten songs here they recorded, and only two are worth ever listening to.Guess what that means....One Star! [2 divided by 10 = 1/5 stars]..Oh yes, those two songs are Touch Too Much and Walk All Over You.The rest is garbage.Don't wast money on this one, trust me."
1,Bad Album....,I hate AC/DC as they are one of my top 20 worst bands of all time. BON SCOTT IS A REALLY ANNOYING SINGER WHO JUST SCREAMS..EVERY SONG IS AWFUL EVEN JOKES LIKE TOUCH TOO MUCH. AVOID THIS LOUSY BAND ANDGO WITH METALLICA BLACK ALBUM INSTED.
1,ZERO STARS...WHAT A JOKE.,"AC/DC are one of the worst bands along with the Beatles. THEY HAVE NEVER MADE ANYTHING DECENT. THEY ARE JUST OVERRATED...HIGHWAY TO HELL IS ONE LOUSY ALBUM THAT CONTAINSJOKES LIKE GIRLS GOT RHYTHM, TOUCH TOO MOUCH, AND WALK ALL OVER YOU. AVOID THIS ALBUM AT ALL COSTS, BON SCOTT IS A REALLY ANGRYSINGER..GO GET ANY DIRE STRAITS CD INSTED, PLEASE!!!"
1,BON SCOTT NEEDS TO STOP BEING SO ANGRY,"I hate AC/DC. They are in my top 15 worst bands of all time and I wish to destroy and kill both of their singers, Brian Johnson and Bon Scott who just scream. They aren't anything like nice singers like Foreigners' Lou Gramm, and Dire Straits' Mark Knopfler at all. They are just 2 minded idiots who are on drugsAND CAN'T SING. Buy this if you are a looser but good bands areDire Straits, Foreigner, GNR, Nirvana, and Green Day who rock!Don't ever buy this album, destroy it today in your trash can.Buy albums from good bands that I mentioned here.PS. Bon Scott is just angry so don't ever buy this."
1,SPIT!!!!!,"Nope, this sucks also like Back in black. Highway to hell andWalk all over you are the only good songs on this intire CD.Bon scott is also a spit too!!! AC/DC SUCKS!! SPIT THESE GODDAMMITS OUT."
1,IS ZERO STARS AN OPTION?,"THIS IS IT. NO MORE, AC/DC IS AWFUL. EVERY OF THEIR ALBUMS SUCK ESPECIALLY THIS. THEIR LEAD SINGERS JUST SCREAM. THEY HAVE THE LEAST TALENT AND ARE ONLY MEANT FOR 12 YEAR OLD GIRLS WITH NO TASTE IN MUSIC. CAN I PLEASE GIVE THIS LP BELOW 1 STAR? I HATETHIS MORONIC BAND! WANT A LOVELY CD? THEN GET FOREIGNER 4 INSTED."
1,One of the Worst Albums Ever,Why do AC/DC command such respect? They only ever wrote one song and simply changed the lyrics. Album after album of the same old crap. It wouldn't be so bad if it was a good song or if Bon could sing or Angus play the guitar. Save yourself some money and stand on the cat - it sounds the same.
5,WORTH IT'S WEIGHT IN GOLD,I CANT THINK OF A BETTER HARD ROCK ALBUM THAN HIGHWAY TO HELL.I WILL RUN OUT OF SUPERLATIVES IN PRASING THIS WHICH IS AS GOOD AS LED ZEPPELIN'S FOURTH ALBUM.I LIKE ALL THEIR ALBUMS TILL STIFF UPPER LIP SO I RECOMMEND THIS VERY HIGHLY.
4,Their finest moment,"Back in Black had some great riffs, but Highway to Hell is really all the AC/DC you need. It features one of the greatest rock frontmen ever in the form of the scrappy Scot, Bon Scott. Much better than his successor, the irritating Brian Johnson, Scott belts out a wonderfully smartassed sleazy vocal style that is unmatched in rock n' roll.If you're going to get one AC/DC album, than look no further. Sadly, their greatest strength-the ability to play simple straight up rock n' roll-is also their greatest weaknesses, as all their albums follow the same format."
3,QUITE OVERRATED,"What is the big deal? This album is highly overrated! I'm not saying that it's bad, it's just that they have much better. The first four tracks and ""If you want blood"" are very good songs, but that is about it. I personally need more than just a couple of good songs on a CD to get it. If you want to get some really good Bon Scott material I would suggest ""High Voltage"" or, my personal favorite, ""Powerage"". Once again, this album is not in any way bad, they just have many albums that are much better, I think. Ya gotta go with ""Powerage"", it's the best!"
2,Poor production/ waste of money,"This one of the first time I heard Bon Scot Sing. I grew up listing to AC/DC with Brian Johnson who is one of my favoirite rock singers.Well the first thing I noticed was Bon Scot's singing. Or what passed for it. On the first song. He sounded so wasted he was slurring some of lyrics.On High way to Hell.The other songs were a little bit better. I saying this because the producer did a poor job the band sounded like a buch of amitures.This CD was such a waste.I recomed any one of their albums with Bon Scot, Brian Johnson. Just not this one."
1,Horrible album,"All I have to say in regard to Highway to Hell is that Mutt Lange turned AC/DC into a pop band. I can't stand this album; in fact, AC/DC's first four albums are rock classics played by a real rock band--everything else is just horrible."
3,Hugely overrated,"I'm sorry, but in my opinion this is an overrated album. It's a very popular album, but I can't understand why, since the title track is about the only truly great song on here, with maybe two or three other tracks that are really worth five stars. Acdc are the masters of rock, but this album doesn't cut it for me."
2,"Not exactly BAD, but Bon Scot-era AC/DC @t it's worst.","I feel that 3 stars is pushing it just a little too much, so more like 2 1/2 or 2 3/4. At least this is 1000 times better than everything after this album! The only thing I like about this album is that Bon Scot is on here. Brian Johnson's voice gets on my nerves more than any other singer's. There are 2 halfway decent tracks on here, ""Shot Down In Flames"", and ""Girls Got Rhythm"". If u want some good old school AC/DC, get ""High Voltage"", ""Dirty Deeds"", ""Powerage"", or ""Let There Be Rock'."
1,"Great Album, Poor Sound 2003 Remaster","Others have mentioned this regarding the poor sound quality of this 2003 Remaster. Trust me, they are right! We all know the album is a classic, brilliant music. Anybody who has heard the Vinyl or previous 1994 remaster knows that this 2003 remaster sounds terrible! Its has way too much treble and there is no slam/punch to the drums and bass. It sounds nothing like how this album sounded when it originally came out on Vinyl. If you love this album and care about good sound quality, do yourself a favour and buy either the 1994 remaster or UK Vinyl. You will see what i mean, this just sounds tinny."
5,Bon's Bon Voyage,"Generally regarded as Bon Scott's Best (and many will agree the Band's best) album, it is certainly the band's most radio-friendly produced album. The band tried for a more commercial sound, and it paid off big time. Highway to hell, Touch Too Much, Shot Down In Flames, If You Want Blood, all have become AC/DC staples. Mutt Lange's production proves he can be successful with any genre of music. Probably the first AC/DC album you should purchase to see if you like this kind of heavy thunk. Of course after the most successful thing they did, Bon went and died, giving him almost legendary status. (What would have been next? many wonder.)Typical. Although the band was concerned with his vocals in the studio before his death, many have done much more with much less talent afterwards. I don't see this should have been such a big concern for the band. After all, Bon was still delivering the goods onstage. Recommended."
5,"BATTERY IS WRONG,THIS ALBUM IS REALLY GREAT","Highway to hell is my best heavy rock album.No day passes without me listening to this cd at least once.I listen to it either in my car or at home.each and every song is amazing with great vocals from Bon Scott and great Guitar solos from Angus young.It would really make me happy if you would buy this.this album is great,and is recommended.Please ignore Battery a.k.a Whirligig from Bakersfield California and buy this today."
5,Still Rockin',"Yeah!!! AC/DC rocks as the BEST metal band to ever hit the studio! I am in the process now of collecting ALL of their albums, music DVD's and clothes. I am telling you, I am a true supporter of one of the GREATEST rock-metal bands EVER! If you are just now introducing yourself to DC, then you should check out this album ""Highway to Hell"" and ""Back in Black"" Go on and treat yourself to some real music!"
5,Vintage Bon Era AC/DC,"This is Bon Scott era ac/dc at its finest. Starting off with the classic song Highway to Hell and with other great tracks such as Walk all over you, the brilliant touch too much and shot down in flames just to name a few, this is Bon's peak in my opinion and his final studio album with the band.The album has a touch of a commercial feel without losing the trademark rawness of the band. I highly recommend it for any AC/DC fan."
5,Learn how to play rock guitar,"Aspiring guitarists take note. Buy this CD. Tune your guitar to this CD. Play with it for 6 months. Learn each song note for note. You will then be ready to play in a band. This is all you need. Trust me. Same for singers, bass players, and drummers. This is the best possible rock music to learn, sing and play. Long live rock!"
2,Won't Last,I used it for awhile without incident... But in about 3 months the joints that screw in would unscrew while walking around (which sometimes created messy situations) and in less than 6 months the wooden handle broke off on one piece. I carried on with the shorter handle for a couple of weeks until the other handle broke off! I think the joints in the middle only make the product weaker. The less often you have to touch it the better!
2,Not nearly as good as the 1910-1980 edition.,"This book is a big disappointment compared to the earlier edition. The omissions of most of the WW II data in the appendixes is glaring. Without this information, most of the history of Naval Aviation disappears. The first edition at $21.00 versus $73.00 for the later one makes it a much better buy. Without the first one you don't have much of the history. Of course, if money is not a problem, get both of them. The second will collect lots more dust."
3,My Apollo 13: The Real Mission Review,"On this CD you get to listen to what exactly happened on Apollo 13. Here you can hear: Astronauts Jim Lovell, Fred Haise & Jack Swigert the real astronauts & Mission Control. It is good drama. When they go for the oxygen tank stir, it explodes. You can hear it exploding over the air. It is like static. This also has John F. Kennedy's speech about sending a man to the moon & bringing him back safely to Earth. Buy this CD. The total time on this CD is 41 minutes 24 seconds. Not a very long CD, but it is very interesting!!!"
5,There is nothing better,"Look. This is plain and simple. There is not a collection of better annotated games out there, and for this price, how could you not buy it! The annotations will instruct you just as well as any middlegame book, and if you ask 10 masters if they think this is a good book, all 10 will say yes."
3,1400-1500 rated player Review,"The only reason I rated this book a 3 is because I only understood a little from the annotations as well as his games. I can see that the games are powerful, but I can't use them to my advantage, or use the sight-of-alekhine in my games.I have purchased this book in hopes that I would become stronger very quickly. I was dissilusioned by the idea that buying a book by one of the greatest (if not best) chessmasters would make me a master myself in no time at all! I was very wrong.For those people who are rated 1500 or below, save your money. Save the 10 dollars for a book you can actualy understand. ""Art of Attack"" is what im readin so far, and so far so good.SUMMARY: Good price, but is over most people's head.Only buy if your rated higher than 1600, and have a willingness and the pateince to learn."
4,Long needed reissue,"Hank Locklin was a fine country singer in both the honky tonk and Nashville Sound styles. This CD is a much welcomed reissued collection of his hits including the classics ""Please Help Me I'm Falling"" and ""Send Me the Pillow."" Check out the organ playing by Ray Stevens on ""Bonaparte's Retreat""! An essential addition to any country music collection."
3,Just Ok,"This product came as described- Stretch cotton terry. If you are looking for a thick, durable, would last through 100 washes changing pad cover, this is not the one. It's very thin, looks and feels more like polyester than cotton, and stains are hard to get out :/. It is soft and fits our contour pad well, it just wasn't quite what I was wanting out of a cotton terry cover."
4,Good cover,"I read other reviews where the changing table cover is thin. And, it is on the thin side. I put it over another cover and it fits very well and looks very good. It also holds up in the wash well."
2,"Nice product, but only 80% cotton","This is a very nice product, but the description says that this product is 100% cotton. Upon receipt the tag said 80% cotton and 20% polyester. We have sensitive skin in our family and I would never have purchased this product if I had known that it was only 80% cotton as opposed to the 100% advertised.If you have no concerns about polyester then this is a nice product."
3,Good but thin,"This cover is fine, but it is very thin. Not nearly as nice as the plush terry cover we already have."
1,CRAP,I just washed this item per the directions. It ripped on both seams! Don't waste your money on this product.
4,Nice and soft but thin,This changing cover fits the changing pad well and feels smooth to the touch. But it is very thin so if you don't have a good cushion on the changing table already then this may not be right for you.
1,Poor quality,"The cover I got is a low quality one. The fabric is harsh and covered in lint balls.The stiching is porrly made as well.I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this, but still upset about this purchase."
2,Not what I expected,"I was rather disappointed with this when I received it. It's not easy to find a red changing pad cover, so I was excited to find this on Amazon. Well, the material is not as soft as I had expected and is somewhat thin. Not that big of a deal. However, what I hate about it is there are two small holes in the center of it for those dumb changing pad straps to fit through. Who actually straps in their baby when changing them? So, now you can see the white changing pad through those two holes and to the average Joe it looks like I have an old ratty changing pad cover that I should replace. Oh well."
2,Doesn't fit a contoured pad,"I was so excited when I finally found a purple changing table pad cover. It lists that it is a ""contoured changing table cover"" but it does not fit the pad even though the measurements were bigger than the pad itself. Instead of laying flat against the pad it sticks up."
2,Meh. Just ok.,Had a hard time finding a Navy cover for my son's room.This one is perfect in color. Nice deep dark Navy (no hint of royal blue). The 2 stars though is because it really doesn't have a nice fit and it's very thin and cheap feeling. It's also not soft at all. Even after 2 washes. It's supposed to be for a naked baby bum people. Seriously? My TP is way softer. For real.
1,"Flimsy, weird slits",Pretty color but material is cheap and not very soft. The slits for the securing straps are in an odd place.
2,Weird,"Weird fit, weird material. But I needed a cover in navy which is really hard to find. Its barely worth the ten bucks i paid. It feels like it is 20 years old and is just really ""pilly"" and not really ""terry"" at all. Not soft either.Instead, I'm having a custom one made to replace this one. That one was 40 dollars on etsy but it has an 8 week delivery. This will work until then."
1,It burns when applied to my sensitive skin...,"In the winter time the skin on both of my hands becomes extremely dry and tight, with flakiness and cracks, like a severe dermatitis. I've been trying every lotion and hand cream I can find to help heal my skin. I saw Dermarest at a local store and felt hopeful that it might work. My skin is so extremely dry that it cracks and creates deep cuts in my skin that are painful. Applying Dermarest felt like I was pouring straight rubbing alcohol onto my skin...it had a burning sensation and was very painful. I have tried my best to deal with it and I've applied Dermarest a few time because I thought it ""may"" be working, but each time I apply the lotion it burns so much that I've quit using it. I don't know if my skin is just super sensitive or what, but I can't use Dermarest. Still searching for a product that will heal my dry irritated hands."
3,Buy it at Walmart,"You can get the product with same active ingredient(salicylic acid) for a little less at Walmart. For psoriasis, you have to use whatever works for you the best."
4,Better Than Most,"I have chronic plaque psoriasis that covers between 75 and 80% of my body at any given time. Like many Americans at this time, I'm out of work and recently became uninsured so I must turn to over the counter treatments.This product has not miraculously cured my psoriasis, but it has helped substantially. The thickest scale has peeled and is now only slightly raised. Overall, the appearance is much more manageable and a few small ""start of an outbreak"" spots have receded.One thing I will note is that it has to be reapplied a few times. The packaged directions say between one and four times a day. People who have less severe cases may be able to use it less frequently, but since I reapply it throughout the day I can definitely smell it all the time--slightly minty or sweet-smelling, definitely not bad, but noticeable."
4,Handle can come off,"I have four of these and on two of them now I have had the handle break off the scoop part. I've been able to fix it with glue, but this shouldn't happen in the first place. Otherwise, I really like this scoop. I keep large bins of flour, rice, and sugar in my kitchen and like to be able to measure straight from the bin as I'm scooping."
4,Good scoop!,"Accurate, easy to read the lines through the see through scoop. It does the job it's supposed too. can't ask for much more. 4 stars because the clear part can separate a little from the handle and dog food crumbs can get in there."
3,Handle fell off almost immediately,"This is a very sturdy scoop with an ergonomically designed handle. It is perfect for scooping out bird seed or cat kibble. I just leave it inside theIris Pet Pantry Airtight Food Container, but you could also clip it directly onto a bag.UPDATE: The handle fell off after a week of basic use."
3,Too Bad You Can't Just Buy Disc One.,"Here's my take on it after a few listens:Disc 1: 3.5/5None of the songs are super great (except for Prologue to History maybe), but all in all, they make a very solid album together.Great Tracks: 1, 4-6, 10, 16-19Could Have Left Off: 12, 13, 20Disc 2: 1.5/5There are only 4-5 good songs on the covers CD. Most of the songs just aren't very good. But I'm sure the Manics play them better than the original bands did.Good Tracks: 1, 2, 7, 13Could Have Left Off: All the others. 6 isn't bad.Total: 5/10If you're like me, you'll find yourself listening to Disc 1 much more often than Disc 2. But for a B-Sides album, its really quite good."
4,My book arrived six days after I ordered it!,"Great book - easy to use and very informative. I have read enough of Win Your Child Custody War to know this is just what I needed. I should have had it ten months ago. I could have avoided a lot of problems. Information about cases that set precedent as recently as 1989 were very helpfull. The first thing it did for me was put my case in prospective by showing me what others faced and overcame. I found the book to be surprisingly interesting. It's very unusual to find a topic that appears to be so horrible, such as a child custody case, brought to life in such a masterful way. It looks like this book was originally written for men. I am a Mother's Rights advocate and will use any good weapon to fight my battle. I recommend the book to anyone involved in this life altering challenge."
3,Not the most beautiful...,"I was not very impressed with this recording. I didn't like many of the choices on this and can think of many other French artists who are much better than the ones on this recording. Its okay, not horrible, but it is not a recording I will listen to often. I think there are better choices out there...."
2,tres bof...,Bof...Repetitive in one style so a little boring... Was expecting a much better choice and I was in fact disappointed.
2,Pump your adenoids,"These are not the 'Most'.They are, for the 'most' part, not beautiful.They are all songs. Yes.But either a tweeter I never knew was in my car just woke up or this album takes everything into 'High Nose' range.One can argue that French has a certain nasal component - though it's not a good argument even after listening to Piaf, let alone Mimi.The selections are nasal:5 by one guymore by another guy5 by some woman2 by Charles Trenet - sounding as bad as I've ever heard him sounding (usually never - I like CT - see 'La Mer' or 'Boum!')more songs by others - even one by Chevalier - but not his bestIt's an albumIt's French.It includes songs.It's worth walking on by. Check out Brel, Aznavour or Montand, Isabel Boulet, Mireille Mathieu, Piaf - of course, St-Pier, Franoise Hardy and that fantastic American import of the '30s: Josephine Baker.But this album? Marcher par elle.Two stars? The album does play ... and it makes sounds."
1,Very old book! Worthless,"No useful information in this book. Totally useless book. No plans, designs,or ideas to use in building a stove to use"
1,A Complete waste of money,"I wish I had read the reviews for this guide before I wasted good money on it. First of all there is no format for this book. It is just one test question after another. Some of the questions are repeated again and again. There are questions concerning typesetting which are completely irrelevant. It's confusing and the glossary of terms and information in the back are good but after looking at the questions, I don't even trust the information. Don't waste your money on this guide. I only give it one star because I had to pick something in order to proceed."
4,Good Buy,I currently own this product and think it is a great buy. I have had the same one for three years and have never had a single issue with it. I definitely recommend this item because it gives you the best bang for your buck.
1,Not Worth It,We purchased this DVD player after reading a good review about it in Outside magazine. Sounds like we were lucky and ours worked almost 5 months before it started to scratch the DVD's and not play anything. I sent it back three months ago and have called every two weeks since to find out when we could expect what I thought is/was going to be a NEW player for a $90 service charge. I am continually told it will be another two weeks before they are in stock. After reading the other reviews I have resigned to the fact that I will probably never see a replacement. Fine by me....I plan on buying another portable DVD player made by a company like Sony or Panasonic. Go Video's customer service is horrid. You can't even get a human being on the phone at their corporate office.
3,Also doing pre-purchase research,"Check out CNET.com. They have rated it higher than others, including the Polaroid PDV-0700. It seems only the expensive units come with an international charger (i.e., 120-240VAC 50/60Hz). Otherwise, the unit is ""one-way"" only on an international flight."
1,Buy another brand,"Although I purchased a different unit, the GoVideo 8440 Portable DVD Player, it played exactly 6 movies before dying. GoVideo replaced it with a refurbished model, which arrived in non-working condition. In addition, the original 90 day warranty is still in force, GoVideo refused to extend it to the refurbished unit. Sitting on hold now with customer service waiting for a answer... I heartily recommend NOT BUYING any GoVideo products unless you are prepared for wasted money and time on hold with customer service."
1,"Poor product, worse customer service","This product is a piece of garbage and the customer support from GoVideo is pathetic. I purchased this product last November for my child's xmas present. Several times it just stopped playing, then resumed working a few minutes, hours or days later. Finally just before the warranty ran out it quit altogether. I contacted GoVideo for support, no easy feat as I waited on hold 45 minutes to 1 hour after no response by email (including 2nd and 3rd emails) for 1 month. They told me my only option was to send the unit back and pay $89.95 for a ""labor charge"" and they would send a new replacement. The replacement arrived yesterday, worked for about a minute and died. I am totally disgusted with this product and company. I would never purchase another product from them again."
1,Horrible battery life and customer service,"I had minimal expectations for this product: that it run for long enough to view one movie in its entirety with a decent picture and audible sound. Well, the picture and sound were fine, but that doesn't do much good if the battery won't let you finish your movie. The manual states the battery should last 2.5 hours, but I found it to be more like 1-1.5. Then, I tried to contact GoVideo customer service and received an automated reply, which was unhelpful. I tried again, and they never responded. Luckily, amazon accepted the product for a refund since it was defective. Save yourself a lot of trouble and get something else."
2,Battery does not work,"I DO NOT HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH THIS TYPE OF EQUIPMENT. MINE WORKS JUST FINE. BUT, THE BATTERY DOES NOT WORK AT ALL. IF YOU WANT TO BUY IT TO KEEP IT CONNECTED IN YOUR CAR OR AT HOME, FINE, BUT DO NOT EVER BELIEVE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO USE IT TRAVELLING (BY PLANE, BUS FOR EXAMPLE). BATTERY LIFE IS OF ABOUT 45MIN TO 1 HOUR. TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS EQUIPMENT BECAUSE OF THAT."
1,Don't buy this item,"I purchased this item and gave it as a Christmas gift (2005). It broke after only 5 days. Because I bought it on line, I can't just return it for a refund. I read a positive review of this item on the CNET website and ordered it. Then I read the negative reviews on this site. CNET should be held accountable for not giving truthful information about this product."
3,NOT A CLASSIC BUT STILL VERY GOOD.,"Well hey...there's simply no way that they could ever hope to live up to the runaway, annual classic that the 1965 special has become, but I still give credit for Charles Schultz for giving it a try in this special that first appeared on tV back in 1992.Basically the gang is all off doing their own things as Charlie Brown is trying to raise money to buy a gift for the little red-haired girl, Linus and Sally go sledding in a box, and the gang put on a Christmas play at school helped by Peppermint Patti and Marcie.Nothing will ever top the original special but this is a good effort still."
2,"A disappointing ""sequel"".","Cannot compare to the original. A forgettable soundtrack, substandard animation, no real plot. Plus the added shock of the gang's voices being so different now. I just couldn't accept this one. I bought it ..a few years ago with such high hopes but it was too disappointing. On the other hand, it made the ORIGINAL twice as heart-warming and a true, genuine classic Peanuts--Charles M. Schulz at his finest!"
1,Your typical sequal - disappointing.,"I bought this video from a gas station in the early 90's. Having grown up with Charlie Brown and the gang, and also being an avid ""young-at-heart"" fan of all Christmas specials - I KNEW that this one would have to be wonderful. WAS I EVER WRONG!! There was no story, no plot, just a series of poorly intertwined sub-plots that weren't even amusing. Poor ol' Charlie Brown sells his comic books to buy gloves for his girlfriend and then gives them to Snoopy. He also is selling wreaths door to door, Snoopy steals candy canes from a tree and uses them as dancing canes, Peppermint Patty forgets her lines in a play - and she is a SHEEP!! I kept waiting for the story to begin - and then the credits began rolling. Please - don't waste your money on this rip-off of classic cartoon characters. (...)"
2,stick to the original,"I was so excited when I heard that a *new* Charlie Brown Christmas special was going to appear on TV. My advice? Don't ruin it for yourself by watching this lame effort. It tries way too hard to be PC, and doesn't even make sense in some spots. Stick with classic Peanuts!"
4,Great Work of Art,I have been a fan of the stage for several decades and have seached high and low for a copy of this production. I saw it on ebay several times for hundreds of dollars but finally it has been made available to all. If you are a lover of great stage performances than this dvd is for you. It has been missing from my collection far to long. You see the late great Jack Lemmon at his best (on stage) and a young raw Kevin Spacey (he even has hair) working togther on stage. Then add Peter Gallagher and Bethel Leslie and you have some of the great stage performers of our time. I missed this one live - don't know how - but still kicking myself. Great to see it on DVD for generations to enjoy.
5,ANDREWS AT HER BEST!!!,"This is a wonderful collection of some of Julie's later recordings. There may be some folks out there who suggest that she wasn't at her ""peak"". I diasgree. Even though there was no more four-octave range, the depth of feeling and the emotional interpretation far surpass anything she did in the '50s or '60s. Her early singing, while beautiful, was practically devoid of any feeling. On this album you hear Julie Andrews the woman; not Julie Andrews the little girl. Highly recommended."
2,background music is terrible,This would be a typical 5 star julie andrews cd if the supporting background music was recorded at a lower level. The cd implies that the songs are soundtracks from the broadway shows but they are obviously retaped versions and poor ones at that. There are many occurrences whereby the music is so loud you can barely hear her voice. I love Julie andrews and was totally disappointed with this cd. Its unfortunate that Decca would realease such a poor recording.
1,Geriatric Julie,"Very slow tempo, horribly electronically ""enhanced"", and accompanied (loudly) by a ten thousand-piece orchestra.I love Julie Andrews, and have for more than fifty years, but I am more than disappointed in this album. Don't you be."
5,Amazing!,Wow! This CD was amazing! Andrew's at her best and the selections were highly appropriate! I enjoyed her style and arrangements! Very worth ig!
2,clasic julie classic broadway,"this is not one orf her best recordings, her voice is not what is used to be, buy only if you're a true follower of her. nelson"
3,Disappointing...,"I guess I was expecting a world class voice doing the songs, just as I loved and remembered them, from Broadway. Julie did her own versions of these, and though her voice was wonderful, as usual, the odd tempos made it a not so fun to listen to or sing along with CD."
5,Classic Julie a Classy CD,I thoroughhly enjoyed the compilation CD of Julie Andrews Best of the Best from her 90's music. And I highly recommend this to anyone who loves good music......A la Jools.
3,"where is oregano, marjoram...?","Great book, except where are the 'o' herbs other than onions, oregano is missing, as is marjoram! How is this possible?"
4,Great Herb book,"I use this book weekly to find herbal remedies and tinctures. Highly recommend to anyone interested in remedies, God's way."
2,The lies authors tell...,"I bought this book as a reference to the various types of herbs and the associated common uses. I guess that it may be an acceptable book for general information regarding the specific uses, but I wouldn't trust the information provided in the chapters. To categorize Egypt as part of Europe on the topic of herbal tradition or anything else for that matter, is a clear indication that several successful attempts were made in effort to denounce the sophisticated contributions that native Africans have made to world civilization and inflate Eurocentric historiography obtained through false means. I really wish I'd kept the receipt to take this back."
2,misleading,when you look at this product. the picture show you two. no where in the write up does it tell you there is only one. i thought i was getting two. and only got one
5,Great general use webcam,"This is one amazing little webcam for the price. The picture quality is VERY decent with a manual focus lens and the mic is very good. The flip-style base works better than the bases found on more expensive webcams and the tripod socket is EXTREMELY useful. On Windows XP, you just plug it in and it works instantly. For the price, it has better value than fancier cams. This webcam just works!"
1,Doesnt work with windows 7,"This product does not work with windows 7, the driver package will not install and logitech does not support this device. I really thought we were beyond the days of lame excuses for developers, but apparently we are not. If you own Windows 7, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
4,Works With Mac,Good choice for an inexpensive webcam that works with a Mac. Picture quality only fair but acceptable.

3,john prine's first cd,"this cd reminded me of a cross between bob dylan and arlo guthrie.it was a very mellow cd.not as good as some of his other music.i really don't recommend it unless you have to have all his music,and don't like alot of excitement."
5,One of the best,"Brings back memories - sitting on the front row at Lafitte's Landing, Prine about 5 feet away. It was simply amazing. What a wry sense of humor.Had the album - wore that out. Even had it on 8-track (threw that machine in the trash). Have it on cassette and CD.Gotta have Prine."
5,R. Thibodeau,Excellent product. To bad that it is not available in Grey. The comfort is much better than higher priced underwear. Delivery was as promised; quick. Champion Boxer Brief 2 Pack u437Champion Boxer Brief 2 Pack u437
5,Back to when I believed in fairy tales....,"If you could, just for a moment, return to the days when fairy godmothers were real, when you really could turn four white mice into four white horses - then just buy this CD for a few smiles, a lot of memories, and the original Rodgers and Hammerstein tunes. This CD took me way back to when magic was there, and now it makes me wonder, everytime I listen to it, if maybe the magic isn't still there? Maybe I should just call on my fairy godmother..... A true heirloom of a CD."
2,No music,There are no Beatle songs on this disc. It contains interviews and on-stage introductions from the Beatles tours of Vancouver (1964) and Seattle (1966). Run time is just over 25 minutes all on one track.
4,Some Anthology Tapes,"This is a good compilations of outtakes versions of 1965, 66 and 67 records. This sound is a sparse sound, but is very audible. Collector's need this."
3,"Fast paced, annoying characters!","I enjoyed bits and pieces of this book, sadly the melodrama was a bit over the top. I think I'll have to be in the right mood for the excess of emotion and drama in this one in order to read it again. I will be trying out other titles, however, as the mystery of the real baddy was good and the writing was fast paced and engaging. I had a bit of trouble with the ""brat"" factor of the female character, and the fact that the male character (who really originates a great deal of the mistrust between the two) never actually apologizes for being such an a**. Of course, the female character prostrates herself, because her love means more to her than *sob* *sob* I can't go on, you get the idea!! Hoping for a bit less obnoxious spoiled girl behavior and a hero I could see hanging around with without popping him in the nose in my next foray into Elizabeth Thornton book."
1,A startlingly less than satisfying CD,This interview cd is one of the few Buddy Holly items offered for sale that is less than satisfying.It is a disappointing interview CD with Red someone in Canada on one of Buddy's tours there. There are also some other artists singing Buddy's music and I feel this is simply an attempt to make money. I buy the authentic music instead and suggest you may prefer to do so.Perhaps if more than just one interview appeared ......
4,The Clapton Years,"During Eric Clapton's short stint with the Yardbirds, the band produced some of the most memorable Yardbird tunes. Classics like ""Smokestack Lightning"" are on this complete and thorough record. Clapton's unmistakeable Blues influence is apparent on this record, and shines through on his guitar. Great album!"
4,"Murdoch Mysteries, Season One",i was very interested in this season one the actors and the season where quite good looking forward to the second season
3,Hoping for better,The actor is cute enough but his looks don't carry the series. I was hoping it would be a gem of a series and it is just alright. It has some fun bicycle stuff and science stuff that is sort of middle school level. The filming is great but the acting lacks something. I guess I like to watch things a little more gritty or funny. Bored Grannies may like it.
4,Interesting show,"Fun revision of Sherlock Holmes type 'who dunnit'. Other than being a little 'gory' due to the dead bodies having autopsies performed on them (who would want to do that for a job?), it is fun to watch how Det. Murdoch solves the mysteries -- even after others have 'closed the case' incorrectly and are satisfied."
2,Flat and unentertaining,"I read the summary and thought that this would be right up my alley since I enjoy mysteries and period pieces. I read the many positive reviews so I took a chance, but it did not pay off for me. I found the series very flat. Character development is lacking--each character is pretty one dimensional. I struggled to get through the first disc thinking that it might get better but I've decided not to torture myself any longer."
1,1890's Canadian CSI... Or Worse!,"This series was a major disappointment. The viewer is presented with jerky flash-cut scenes, upbeat action music that in no way fits the era, and a focus on old-tech wizardry... all arrayed to disguise one-dimensional characters caught in a very thin screenplay with obvious episode plots. The concentration on gore and spaghetti shots is as off-putting as the continual barrage of politically correct messages.My wife and I were expecting a series with genuine substance. From several of the positive reviewer comments, it seems this series is considered great viewing among those who regularly buy lottery tickets. Sadly, the Murdoch Mysteries simply add to the heap of mindless titillation from which too many folks amuse themselves to death. No thanks -- not our taste."
2,Politically correct nonsense,"Imposing 21st Century politically correctness on a supposed 19th Century world ruins the series. It is not entirely certain whether the series intends to belittle the mentality (and faith) of everyone or just Canadians. Though the series tries to be forensically scientific, it more nearly resembles fantasy with frequent anachronisms, fallacious logic, and impossible situations. The quality is good (2 stars) but the content insults the intelligence (one star). The second disk gets positively preachy."
4,good show,"I really enjoyed this show and see what the detectives used years ago to figure out who done it. Also, the interaction between the two detectives and Dr Ogden."
2,"Murdoch Mysteries, Season One",Didn't live up to my expectations. Just OK in my opinion. The acting is really subpar.
2,Through the back door reading,"The first several chapters were good, set in a church/churchyard. I can't believe the rest of the book is written by the same person. It's lots of orgies in a hotel (not very descriptive). A lot of through the back door sex and lots of sadistic torture. If you're into that, you'll love it."
4,ASG,"I heard one of their songs in a snowboard video (Wildcats Diary and Night of The Living Shred) and I thought it was pretty good. I later one went out and got the album and I love it. I especially love the guitar in this. To be honest with you, I love all of the instruments. This is a great album by them and I cant wait to hear their next."
3,kevin S. review,"When I think of surf,punk and rock'n'roll I think of legendary bands like THE VENTURES,DICK DALE, THE CHEIFS,THE CROWD,T.S.O.L.,CHINA WHITE,THE SIMPLETONES,AGENT ORANGE,RIK L. RIK,D.I,AGGRESION.I also think of modern day greats like THE STITCHES,THE FAKES,SMOGTOWN,THE PEGS,THE PUT-ONS,and of course THE SMUT PEDDLERS.There is nothing particularly punk about this band.I would consider their music stoner surf rock,the kind of sh-t Jeff Spicolli would listen to.I've met these ""dudes"" and they are nice guys and decent surfers,I just dont think their band or their label,VOLCOM RECORDS,represent true surf punk culture."

1,A bunch of gas,"I though this book would be about those who fixate on Nitrogen, but it had something to do with plants."
4,"Intense experience, reminicent of Mogwai, highly recommended","This is the second CD I've bought of this DC-based post-rock trio...and it contains whatever was on their first EP from like 2001. These guys play their live shows LOUD, and that is how this album is enjoyed best. It's essentially a 3-piece (guitar, bass/keys, drums) but some of the tracks here have an extra layer or two thrown in. Not that it matters, because there is already an intense wall of sound coming from the fuzz and delay-laden guitar and the constantly rolling drums. All the songs are great quality instrumental rock (track 1 and a couple others have vocals), and I think the album is worth purchasing for tracks 2 and 5 alone (my personal favorites), and you know you're getting a quality product when it is distributed by Southern Records (www.southern.com)."
1,Great Value!!,"I picked up one for $167 during the Turkey Day sales to replace a very aged 17in tube monitor and am definitely impressed. I have held out for quite some time for a great deal on a LCD as this computer is primarily used for surfing, e-mail, etc. ... but so far, it was definitely worth the money and the wait. As mentioned in the other reviews, I also found the stand a bit ""cheap"" but where else can you get a 22 in LCD for this price! Still unable to make the speakers work, but not a big concern. Anyhow, strongly recommend this one if you can get it for under $200."
1,VERY VERY short life,I loved this monitor when I purchased it. However it died at 18 months and there was absolutely nothing to do but buy a new monitor. Basically spending $150 every year and a half for a monitor is ridiculous. I will not be purchasing any Westinghouse products again.It's true you get what you pay for. Don't save yourself money now - you'll just have to shell out more later.
4,What A Great Affordable Monitor!,"I love this monitor! Even though specs say 700:1 contrast ratio,The box has it clearly written that this is a 1000:1 contrast ratio.The W2 version was 700:1 This is the W3 version at 1000:1.No swivel but does tilt. So what?I love it."
4,Weak Speakers,"Great Picture but weak speakers. I would rate the picture a five but, I had to purchase speakers. If all you use the monitor for is PC sounds they would be good enough for that. Ended up with $50 more for speakers. So I paid $260 total for a 22"" Monitor & speakers which is still a good deal."
5,Great plug and play buy!,I have been looking for a monitor for some time now and stumbled upon this one for Black Friday sales. Very pleased with all aspects. A winner in my book.
1,Short Life,I purchased 2 of these monitors 23 months ago. Both monitors died within 3 weeks of eachother. That is a short life in my opinion. Won't purchase Westinghouse again.
2,There is a way to fix this moniter!,"My husband bought out moniter after Christmas in 2008. For the past several months it too has been taking forever to turn on. I did have problems with it randomly shutting off, but fixed that by telling my computer to never put it into sleep or standby. I researched if this was a common probem and lo and behold it is. I was able to find a fix for it, 8 of the capitors need to be replaced. I found this on a repair website. Apparently the capacitors will eventually not hold a charge and the moniter will die. Stinks seeing as my husband paid over $200 for it less than 2 years ago. you can buyt he parts for about $15 and looks like a fairly easy repair. Will post an update once we have received the parts and replaced the bad capacitors."
2,Don't Connect to a Laptop,"Now I fried my power supply a year ago and switched to a laptop because my desktop computer was outdated anyway, so I tried to hook it up to my 15.4 inch laptop comp. and it is so pixelated that you cant look at it with crying, it is truly disgraceful. However, when it was hooked up to my desktop it worked well, and I had no problems with it considering the price (180). Do not buy this if you plan to hook it up to a laptop. (mine has a 512mb dedicated video card, so there is no graphics problem)"
2,Not great,This book couldn't hold my interest. I didn't like the way the author went back in time and bounced around. It got good towards the end. Too much of the book dealt with his childhood which was not relevant to the story of his adult years and his women.
3,"Can't live with 'em, can't live without `em","Maximilian West thinks about the women in his life as he lies critically injured, his thoughts taking him back to his youth in pre-WWII Germany and England, then on to his life as an adult in Europe. More of a fictional history of Mr. West than a study of the main women in his life, it's still a fairly consistently entertaining novel, worth the effort to read.However, for me at least, for a book about a business tycoon it was awfully thin on the business side, the wheeling and dealing, hostile takeovers, buyouts, tender offers, boardroom antics, politicians bribed and competitors beaten, and awfully thick on who was wearing what type of designer dress and what style someone's 5th Avenue apartment was decorated in. But maybe that's a bit of a mismatch between the book's target audience and me. You be the judge."
4,I liked it,"Other reviewers have described the essence of the story. I just discovered that it was a ""Readers Digest Condensed Book."" That would have been the perfect way to read it. I did find it interesting & worth my time to read it."
1,Not so comfortable,The shoe is too narrow and the sides dig into my feet. The sole of the shoe makes it feel like you are off balance. I have narrow feet but the structure of this shoe does not lend itself to a comfortable wear at all.
2,This bracelet is ugly - nothing like the picture,"The flowers on this bracelet are quite large - the picture doesn't accurately depict it. There is nothing dainty about this piece. I would NOT pay the full price listed on Amazon, and I don't feel it is worth the price I paid either ($49). The other thing I don't like about this bracelet is the large gap between the flowers, where the clasp attaches. There are needless links that create this space and make it quite unattractive."
4,"""so recognizable...one of reggae greats...Jah No Dead!""","Great job by Hip-O Records, Dana G. Smart (compilation producer) and Pat Lawrence (executive producer) always giving music fans what they crave, unforgettable and political music from the reggae genre...featuring Winston Rodney (Burning Spears), performing twenty tracks of finger-pointing phrasing. Entire album is very good, just missed a five star rating by a hair, no doubt he is one of the greats from Jamaica.If reggae is your bag, other titles by Hip-O ~ ""Third World Ultimate Collection"" (314-541-123-2), ""Lee ""Scratch"" Perry Ultimate Collection"" (314-541-301-2), ""Steel Pulse Ultimate Collection"" (314-541-463-2)...Total Time: 74:48 on 20 Tracks ~ Hip-O Records 314-524-834-2 ~ (2001)"
1,"Oh My, this is terrible","I listened by recommendation to Burning Spear Alive(live in concert 97 Vol 1).... INCREDIBLE, just fantastic CD...Figured the Ultimate Collection Burning Spear would be betterDON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH ULTIMATE COLLECTION...In my opinion; Songs are short and not close to the Burning Spear Alive albumI noted above....cheersDavid"
1,Dont be silly my friends!,Do yourself a favor and only buy his albums. They're much more solid. One Love. Peace.
3,Pod,"My husband purchased it for the boost gauge he had gotten for our 2004 Volvo that is a turbo, although we didn't need it because the gauge came with a pod already. But it fit perfectly and will still come to use."
3,You will pick up interference,"Shielding in this cable, if it is there, is only partially effective. You will hear hiss and see picture aberrations. But it's cheap. Your call."
5,What can I say.....they're cables,Not a whole lot to say. Using these cable to capture Analog video from my DVR to my PC (needed 50ft to run under the house). They work great and the price was just right.
3,Wasn't what i expected.,"Admittedly, it is my own fault for not looking closely enough to realize this is a childrens book. It's roughly the same dimensions as a coloring book, and the information inside is just as basic. That being said, it is perfect for a young person interested in the subject.However, I must point out that at least one piece of info (and I believe several others) are inaccurate. The small section on Author Whitley Strieber says that he believes the aliens took over his mind. This is an outright lie. He has never stated anything of the sort. Several other stories seem to have inaccurate information as well, but at this point I haven't looked further into it.Other than that, the book has a few stories that even a seasoned UFO enthusiast may not have read before. Overall, a fun read, if your kids aren't easily scared."
5,Bikini Brilliance!,"This was the second video I bought made by Aesthetic VideoSource and it was really great! This videos goes through the process of Brazilian bikini waxing slowly showing all each step. The instructions are so easy to follow. After I watched the video just one time, I felt so much more confortable and confident offering this service to my clients. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to learn how to do Brazilian bikini waxing. You won't be dissapointed!"
4,good lessons,"I would have liked to have seen this one while in school with other students to share opinions. But I consider it a good investment. I learned a lot from it but like others not everyone is going to be as ""cleaned up"" as the models here. But after watching it a few times I feel rather confident I can deal with the hairy ones anyway. good lessons."
1,Not to happy,"This dvd had some good tips but the models they used were not the typical average client and they did not have alot of hair to wax, I was pretty disappointed."
2,"Zorro, the Fox",First let me say that this has no context in history. We have beautiful people portraying themselves to be Mexican. California was no where near the hot bed of Mexican-American culture.For one:1) Texas was the first shot fired for supposed American independence.2) Mexico considered slavery abhorrent. The main reason Mexico went to war against the United States was because it didn't won't slavery. Because Mexicans had been subjugated to slavery under Spain.3) Mexicans also became slaves under the United States. Second class citizens and thus far have remained second class citizens.God bless America. I will fight for her no matter what! This movie proved none of that. Europeans trying to pass themselves by as Mexican patriots.
1,COMPLETELY DISSAPOINTING,"The first movie was surprisingly good; the second suprisingly bad. The first one had one of the most beatiful leading ladies in memory; the second one has you wishing she would simply shut up and quit nagging Zorro. Even the climax, in which a runaway train threatens to run over dozens of clueless villagers would have been solved by simply having them walk off the tracks with 10 minutes to spare !Most good film series can last 3 or more entries, it's too bad they killed Zorro in just his second time around."
3,Takes a while to get started,"This movie was fun but had several problems:1. The Plot:The whole concept of starting the civil war 10 years early combined with the ""split up"" Anyone familar with history, of the time and knowledge of the church at that time would have seen big issues here.2. The kid:He was a pain in the neck who needed to be put over someone's knee, and it the 1950's it would have happened REAL quick.3. You would have thought that once the secret was revealed they would have mentioned grandpa Zorro too. Also the only reason why that farmer gets killed is that Zorro spends so much time showing off instead of killing the bad guys, this is the difference between dashing heroes of this decades and the 30's.Now there was some cool action and you found yourself cheering for Zorro, his relationship with his kid (the playing the fop) was pretty good as was his reactions to the loss of his wife.It is a good date movie, but it is not as good as the first one."
4,A hero for the ENTIRE family!!!,"Yes, it has been seven years since the first. Yes, there is no Sir Anthony. However, this is a really good movie. I hesitated before I bought it and was about to put it back when I said, ""What the heck."" WOW! I am so glad that got it. It was a good hero movie, one that the entire family could watch. There are a few scenes that worried me, but overall, alot better than some of the crud that you see. If you are tired of all the comic book hero crap and want a story with characters who have endured then this is it!!! You wont be disappointed."
1,Not that great,This movie was not my favorite. I thought it was poorly written. I wouldn't recommend watching this. Waist of time.
2,Z FOR ZORRO?,The legend returns but not like he used to be. He is protecting California at the year 1850 he is a family person in San Francisco with a wife and a son. As a family person he has kind of family problems. He can't keep his promises towards his wife and she going to see another man. Well well this is definitely not the Zorro I knew and I did feel that one of the best heroes of my childhood is turning in to something different. The only similarity I found is that he is still after the bad guys and still protecting the good but I am not sure anymore about his future.For a project of $80 Million dollars I was expecting much more I do not recommend this movie and I will give it 2 stars only for the beauty of Banderas and Zeta-Jones.
3,zorros back!!!,"zorro is back, i was expecting this sequel to be great since it had the same director and antonio and catherene zeta jones back unfortunatly it wasnt that great.the plot was a bit silly but i still found it enjoyable.i was happy that the same music was stil there so that helped"
2,"Silly, Just Silly","There is only one word to describe this flick - SILLY. Good for 10 year olds and younger. Story weak. Acting mediocre. The action sequences look very ""staged"" and unnatural and are unbelievable. One glaring error. This movie is set in early California, before it becomes a state. Near the end of the film they show an American flag - and it has 50 STARS on it!!! Mama Mia!! Couldn't even get that right. The title should have been ""The Legend of Zero""."
5,"Zorro is back, after 7 years","Diego has past, Alejandro is a new Zorro, he married Ellea she had a son who doesn't know his father. Ellea is having an affair too. Great movie."
5,I LIKE IT A LOT!!!,"This is a very entertaining movie. The action, plot, and actors were great. I loved what they did with Elena and the son. I could have seen move ""Zorro"" moments, but none the less I really enjoyed this movie."
3,"Zorro ""ZAPS"" Less Than The First..","Good Family Movie! No doubt! Not too many action plots until the middle to end of it. Zorro plays his character well throughout the sequences as does his wife. The movie just lacks a little ""Flash"", but has more ""Spunk"" than the first only because there's a new ""KID"" in town----literally (his son)! The movie is a firestorm trailblazer and is fun for the whole family! Pick it up and don't forget your son!"
1,This Could Have Been so Great!!!,"In an age of sperheroes as real ""heros with hangups,"" this movie is at least fifteen years behind the times. This is a cheesy incarnation of the otherwise potential-filled Zorro character. What a waste of acting talent, money, hope, and my time this movie was! What do you think, Hispanics are shallow and want Soap Operas???"
3,A good entertaining movie for General Viewing,"Have seen this movie several times, but not for a few years. A bit of action, a bit of comedy, bit of romance and pretty light-hearted"
5,love it,"i love the actors, love story, action, scenery, and moral value. I used to watch the old zorro series. Good show."
5,The Legend of Zorro,Love the action and quality of this movie. It was a requested Christmas gift. We will enjoy it during the holidays.
4,Added to the First episode,Great action movie with a family message and lots of comedy. It is always a pleasure to see Ms Jones in film.
4,Zorro's back and it's better then the first,After seven years zorro is back and it's better then the first film. I liked thfirst film but found it long and it dragged at points. This film is long and it drags a little but not much. The story is good and the acting is good from all the charactors. The directing is good and the score is again good. At tiems the film is corney and zorro always comes to the rescue at the perfect time the film. Overall I enjoyed this sequal and it's better then the first.
1,and so... the legend dies,"this has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen. it has no logic whatsoever. very boring. horrible dialogue. this movie needed to be pg 13 to be even the least bit good.I cant tell you how much i wanted to be and the theater across from me seeing saw 2.the action is absolutely mindless and stupid.you would have to be completely out of your mind to enjoy this film. zorro has turned into spy kids.which i might add is way better than this. sony need s to make more movies like stealth,and spider man.if they keep making crap like this, we may be looking at a stinker with spider man 3.zorro's son is so retarded.avoid this trash and go see stealth:the best movie ever made."
5,Fun,"I ordered it for my dad and he thinks it is so cool. I have watched it before and it is ok. I dont like quirky movies and Zorro has so been over done! However if you are bored on a miserable afternoon, it will cheer you up."
1,what was this?,"This movie is unbelievably bad... but I'm not surprised that there are folks that love it. If you don't mind plot holes, historical inaccuracies, formulaic plot twists, and mediocre to terrible acting, then this is the movie for you!"
2,"When a Zorro movie needs explosions, you know the filmmakers are lost","I'm not sure what happened in the creation of this movie. There are some good elements lost in the mess, but they're crushed under layer upon layer of other stuff, that was seemingly added by an endless parade of Hollywood executives.Zorro is still a great, enduring icon, probably today moreso than ever. But when the filmmakers make a Zorro movie that isn't about a charismatic swashbuckler, but instead seems to center on explosions, a weird proto-socialism and divorce (in 19th century California, no less), you know the heart of the film has gotten lost. Oh, and there's some truly awful ""cute kid"" and ""cute animal"" bits.Skip this one and watch the original a second time."
1,"Movie Good, DVD Bad","If I was reviewing the movie itself, I would give it three stars. While a lot of fun and I enjoyed it thoroughly, the plot itself had more holes than a colandar. It just didn't have the quality of the first movie.I gave this review one star because of the DVD itself. Apparently, Sony took the full screen version and cropped off the top and bottom of the screen to make it appear to be widescreen. There were many instances of the tops of heads being truncated and, in the scenes where Zorro is talking to his son in Spanish, many of the English subtitles had been cropped out. I found that part especially annoying!Frankly, presenting this as widescreen is out and out fraud. Sony should be ashamed (and shot or prosecuted) for putting out fraudulent products like this."
4,DJ Cam - Soulshine,"Soulshine is DJ Cam's return to greatness. Starting off with the bright and sunny (and housey!) ""Summer in Paris,"" Cam manages to reintegrate his loves: hip-hop, jazz, and soul. The sultry ""Welcome to Soulshine"" gives you an idea of what's coming. This album seems more soul-oriented than hip-hop: ""Love Junkee"" or ""He's Gone"" are perfect example. ""Child's Play"" is a beautiful track, full of sweeping horns and warm feeling. ""Bounce"" is an extended jam, and ""Soulshine"" is shimmering and red-hot. This US edition also includes a disc of remixes and interviews, with the standout being the Kid Loco remix -- his stoned attitude putting a different spin on the nu-soul ""He's Gone."" Definitely worth examining."
2,not my genre but anggun still rocks,"ok i admit it, i buy this cd just because anggun is in it.the rest of this album definately not my kind of music.anggun collaboration with Cam is not her best work.notice that dj cam has drop 'dj' for his name.so dont expect electronice trance on this one.its a pure blend of jazz.something maybe ur choice of music.i believe for jazz lovers.this album is worth to buy."
2,Very Disappointing,"If it wasn't for Voodoo Child, this CD would be completely worthless, it's painful."
4,"Not perfect, But works","I ordered this item for my Hoover Empower vacuum cleaner. I thought it would be a perfect replacement, but the tab at the top is too small, thus the anchors do not click/hold the filters tightly at the top. The bottom rubber hosing is too large thus fits extremely tightly into the incoming air hole. The length and width of the filter seems fine. Although it works and collects the dust accordingly, just wished it was a better fit item.Not bad for the price, but not perfect fit."
4,Hepa filter,These filters work extremely well at what they are suppose to do! It can get very dirty very quickly. My only contention is that they are so difficult to get totally clear of fine dust & dander particles. I bang & brush but it never gets completely clean. Next time I need to replace it I'll try the washable ones.
5,Fits and works,"I have only used the vacuum cleaner once since I installed the new filter, but the filter fit, and the vacuum cleaner is working great."
2,Generic HEPA Filter Too Short,"This product arrived quickly and with free shipping as promised. The concept is great but it does not properly fit on my model which is one of the models specified. It is not quite tall and wide enough, so the vacuum looses suction and alot of the particles that are picked up are accumulating in areas of the vacuum where they shouldn't. Second generic HEPA filter I've tried; guess I'll have to pay Hoover for the exact type."
2,Hoover Filter,Only comment is that the filter fits too loosely in the 'mesh' holder. Still works though!Construction seems similar to an OEM. Like having a spare filter and this one is relatively inexpensive.To save $$$ on these filters I blow them out after every use with my shop air compressor!Joe
1,Straight Garbage!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I made the horrible mistake of buying this cd for the fact that it was produced by organized noize and backbone was part of the dungeon family. Dungeon Family + Organized Noize Production = Definite Hit right? WRONG!!! I'm a big fan of both parties, but I honestly don't know how or why they released this trash. Backbone is probably the weakest rapper I've ever heard in my life. He squeeks when he raps....literally squeeks. He sounds like he has indefinite hiccups. Seriously, I would place this album somewhere in the top 5 worst rap albums ever! I don't mean to be a hater, but I spent my hard earned cash on this garbage and ended up selling it for $1 at a pawnshop b/c NOBODY wanted to buy it from me. It's really that bad......."
3,3 1/2 stars--pretty good album,"I only picked up this album because I'm a fan of the Dungeon Family. There are some standouts on here like ""5 Deuce 4 Tre"" (which derived from a line Backbone said in OutKast's ""Slump"") and ""Lord Have Mercy"" (featuring Cee-lo). ""Come See Me"" (featuring Sleepy Brown) and ""O.K."" ride the line between catchy and trite but they still get heavy play in my system. The rest of the songs are okay, nothing to run and tell a friend about, but not bad enough to be filler, either."
2,In The Middle (2.5 Stars),"I don't really know what to say about this album. On one hand, some songs are tight. On the other hand, it seems like a perfect waste of a good beat (see track #10). I bought this album because I like most of the Dungeon Family's work. The intro is kind of misleading because it's kind of hot, but most of the album isn't. Some songs play with the beat for so long that it makes you want to skip it (see track #11). Also, I didn't like how an old Outkast beat was jacked on track #9(from the Aquemini outro). Speaking of Aquemini, the hook from ""Slump"" was jacked too (on track #13). This album did make me wonder where Witchdoctor went. He's so underrated. If you're not a die hard southern rap fan, skip this one.Personal Favorites: Concrete Law, Hit & Run, Lord Have Mercy, 5 Duece - 4 Tre, & Come See Me"
2,one dissapointed cuzz from tha souf,This album was aiight. the only reason why i didn't give it 3starz was because it was below my expectations. He got potential but dem beats was weak. One thing bout Ga music is either u gone love it or hate it. This cd i hate. Dont but dis folkz.
3,HP A 716 Photosmart printer,This product works in a fair way but its too slow in printing. The quality of the image on the photo is good.
2,Not a working printer,This printer was not working so I returned it to see what was the problem. It wasn't able to be fixed so I think the rest of themoney should be returned.
4,Hitchhiker's Guide on the 5 point track,"This is a short book, 190pp., that's pretty practical and points out the Best Practices & Lessons Learned in a major Lean Transformation. All the chapters are broken down into five key points and that makes it easy to digest and use as a checklist."
5,The ONLY lean book with a focus on thinking vs tools!,"Every time I read this book (think I'm on my 4th or 5th read), I learn at least 2 - 3 more new things. While I've heard a few people say ""that book didn't do much for me,"" they've been the people who truly don't understand what lean is really all about, which is the thinking! And this is what sets this book apart from others - the focus on principles, leadership moves, pitfalls, and then how to personalize the journey are invaluable and have helped me not only in my personal lean journey but in our journey within Intel Corp. Had it not been for this book and Jamie and Andy's teachings, we would easily be 2 - 3 years behind where we are today.No, it shouldn't be your first lean read, but NOT reading this book within your first year or so will undoubtedly cause you to stumble far more than you should in your efforts. Kudos again to Jamie and Andy - I'm eagerly awaiting the sequel!Kurt"
2,Disappointing...,"Well...27 positive reviews convinced me to buy this book. Unfortunately I did not found anything new, nor interesting, nor inspiring.Sorry to say but waste of time and money."
5,Must Read,This book is a must read for any lean practioner. Jamie and Andy discuss how lean can guide all aspects of a business and the principles behind lean. The book covers every thing from kaizen to strategy deployment to accounting. Jamie and Andy break down lean in easy to understand verbiage while explaing the principles as well as discuss pitfalls and successes they have seen in implementing lean.I can't recommend this book enough. Whether you are just strarting your lean journey or are well established in lean this book is worth the time.
5,Useful Guidepost to Lean,"Jamie and Andy have written an easy to read, and clear description of the challenges and excitement of the lean journey. It is much more meaningful coming from real practioners.I often suggest this book for my clients who want to understand what lean is about.Personally I often refer back to the 4 Lean Rules from Hitchhiker's Guide in supporting changes during lean kaizen events."
5,Great book about change management/lean transformation,Every company is under change right now should read this book. It is a great book for folks with lean background. You will learn how to be a great change leader. The concept can apply to any scenario (not necessary related to lean).
4,Great book,Great book. I bought it for our culture transformation in our company and all 24 people involved liked it.It touches on the wide range of positions touched by the transformation.
5,One of the Best,"I have used ""The Hitchiker's Guide"" as a training tool for Lean Champions. The examples and information are based on 'real' examples that open up understanding of the Lean transformation and cultural change. If you don't have a Lean library, this would be a great start or addition."
1,Overpriced - Just a workbook - Expected more - Nothing New,"I read the review of the book prior to buying the book and I was impressed by the way the review was written. When the ""work booklet"" came, I was immediately disappointed because I expected, for the price, a ""hard bound book"" with some real depth of the game including many techniques to try. The booklet was so small that I read everything within an hour. The 24 hour service was to call the casinos around the U.S. I did'nt need that. I felt that I should be able to call the Author or someone associated with the Author and get some real Help, as we say (from the horses mouth). This booklet gave 1 technique and I have known about that from other books. Personally, I wish I didn't buy this book. As far as I am concerned I would not recommend this book."
2,There is nothing like M. Larcange in LONDON PHASE 4 STEREO,"I'm sorry, but I don't like this CD. The very best is the music that Mr. Larcange recorded with London/Decca under the label Phase 4 Stereo. The music, the arragements, the orchestras, the accordion, all were SPECTACULAR!For our delicious, Vocalion has reissue (at last! At Last! At last!) after 35 years, one of the 2 better LPs music of London Phase 4 Stereo: ""Larcange plays Legrand"" and ""Larcange plays Aznavour"".Vocalion launched this title (1 CD with the 2 LPs) last 1st November/2004. I hope that Amazon.com will have soon in his catalogue. If you want this CD now, you must write to www.duttonlabs.demon.co.uk They have too the music of Ronnie Aldrich (""Destination Love"" and ""Love"", two beautiful LPs of the 70's in the best sound for two pianos!). Absolutely recomended!"
2,A good book for starting film novices.,"Don't be fooled that after you follow this book, and make your ""used car"" budget film that you'll soon see it on the big screens everywhere. You'll end up with a first project on a journey of a long learning process. Is it better to spend the ten grand for school? Maybe. A lot can be said for taking that plunge into cold water and getting your feet wet. Although, some people want the prestige of a piece of paper from an institution. Most of the methods are sound, but the book is pretty much outdated for today's high tech world. Beginning filmmakers rarely shoot on film, but instead go for cheaper video. It's a less painful process. Especially for your pocketbook. It's a good book for student or hobby filmmakers. But please don't shoot a feature using this book as an example. Read it as inspiration."
5,Should be a text book in film schools!!!!,"This book is great. I've read alot of feature film financing books out there, but nothing like this. To all my filmmaker friends: ""Get this book."" It gave me some confidence that filmmakers should get before shooting a ultra-low budget film. It also gave me alot of ideas to save tons of money from my budget."
3,It's ok,"I don't pretend to know what I'm talking about but this was an all right book. I don't really care if Cagney was spelled incorrectly and I don't think that this book is the bible of filmmaking. It does however make some intersting points. For someone with little to limited expirience in filmaking and wanted to give it a shot this book is great but if you are among one of the privilaged few to have produced a film and make films than this book is probably not for you. If you know so much about ""how to make a movie the right way"" then why did you buy the book in the first place?"
5,This is the Bible of low-budget filmmaking.,"I had heard great things about this book and when I bought it I wondered if it would live up to all the hype. I am VERY happy to say that it went beyong living up to it and in fact exceeded all of my expectations.If you have even the smallest of desires to make a film, this book will prove extremely dangerous to you as you quickly realize that you can make a film. As I read it my mind began to wander as I realized that making a film was possible. I can not reccomend this book enough! BUY IT!"
2,buyer beware,"A few good ideas are in here but ultimately it is unrealistic if you want to make a quality film. Taken with other how to film books it will do no harm but this will not prepare you for anything but film club type of projects.There are many ways to keep a budget down but most in here only limit the quality ceiling. If you are in this financial catagory - forget film and shoot on consumer or prosumer format and use the experience as a learning tool. Better yet, use the 10 grand to spend some time in a city where films are made with low but realistic budgets of at least 50 grand. Then get on some shows as a PA.Why waste your money making something that looks like the dreadfully photographed and recorded ""Clerks"". That all this book will help you do.Shoot your thing on tape and use the tape to sell your self as a director or writer."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!,"I have directed several independent features that have been screened at Sundance, Toronto, etc. Never in all my experience have I seen advice so detrimental as the type dispensed by Mr. Schmidt. For instance, ""steal the film, steal the camera, and promise to pay everyone (but don't)"" is the kind of guidance that damages the industry. Mr. Schmidt would like to ""sit at table"" with judicious independent filmmakers. Ain't gonna happen."
2,Worked...for a few years,"We purchased a Xantrex 1800 maybe three years ago, and it worked fine until this past weekend. We used it as a backup for our basement sump pump. During a couple/three electrical outages it kicked in and ran the pump fine for several hours. However, this past weekend the power went out and we plugged the refrigerator into it and got an E03 error message. And that was it, it worked no more. It wouldn't reset. When the power came back on, we plugged the Xantrex back into an outlet to see if maybe that would reset it, and it acted like it was fine -- even indicating that it charged back up to 100% battery capacity. But when I unplugged it to test it, I got the E03 error message again.Not sure what to do now. I don't want to buy another Xantrex, but I don't see much else out there on the market."
1,PowerSource 1800 // Feedback,"I bought this item. It was charding for 4 days. I am getting the same messages Ch9. It keeps flashing ON and OFF. According to the manual the MAX time for charge is ~15hrs. I tested the item with sump pump and it works ok! But this ON and OFF is annoying. After ~15hrs it should change to solid FUL. If I pay hundreds of $, I want to be happy. On the manual there is ""Contact Information Telephone: 1 360 925 5059(direct)"". I am keep calling to this # to get explanation of event but I am getting ring - no answer. If I want to ship item back, I have to deal with its weight and shipment charges and then wait for my $ back. Do not like situation at all. I would not say ""Recommend"" of ""Waste of you time"". It is up to you to decide."
1,Ok album overhyped.,"This was a decent ""AC/DC"" brand rock album, nothing compared to other acts of the era. This album would be remade over and over until bon died."
3,Get the Australian cds if you can,"Three stars simply because it is a compilation. By itself it is not bad, and actually very good, but if you are more than a casual listener, get the Original Australian High Voltage (with the red cover and Dog) and T.N.T. This album is actually T.N.T with some tracks added and some deleted. Little lover and She's Got Balls still annoy me to no end. These were tracks from the original High Voltage. Why this was called High Voltage and Not T.N.T is still a mystery as most of the tracks were from T.N.T and not High Voltage."
3,Best in Small Doses,"I have often listened to AC / DC music played in the background on radio and have become attracted by the great sounding and hard-hitting guitar riffs. Usually I have lost interest again because of the length and monotony of the songs - and a singer that easily gets on my nerves.The very funny and entertaining movie ""School of Rock"" in which Jack Black performs several of the group's early numbers gave me, however, encouraged me to learn more about the group.This early album contains the great ""It's a Long Way to the Top"" and others of the group’s well-known numbers, but again I have conclude that small doses of this band work best for me.All is well produced (Vanda / Young) and well played - lyrics that may provoke but with a twinkle in the eye, solid numbers which, however, easily may appear somewhat identical."
4,179 bucks? BWUAHAHAHAHAHAH,"This is the original 1974 High Voltage release. Only released in Australia, you may notice its tracks resemble that of 74 Jail break released years later in 198something after Bon Scotts death.AC/DC released this and an album called T.N.T in Oz, and when releasing there first international release, they combined the best of the two albums... pretty much two tracks from this, and the rest where from TNT.However, this is still the only album you can hear ""love song"" and ""stick around"" or is that ""you ain't got a hold on me?"" ..whichever...now, completely ignore amazons sellers asking 170 bucks for this? BUWHAHAHAHAHAHAHA the album is still in print in Australia and it will cost you under 30 bucks to import it from here... god, what a rip off."
5,T.N.T is born!!!!!!,"T.N.T., one of the best AC/DC songs ever, and on this cd, is great. I would buy this cd for that song alone. AND ALL OF THEM ARE GOOD!!!!!!! It's a Long Way to the Top is great. Awesome cd maybe the best one with Bon Scott. Title track is amazing. Not much else to say. YOU WON""T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!!"
4,"It's AC/DC, what do you expect?","Not my favorite AC/DC album of the Bon Scott era but a classic nonetheless (and their first American release). Get it for two songs, no not T.N.T. and High Voltage, everyone knows those, but for It's A Long Way to the Top and Live Wire. If you already have this CD and are wondering if the digitally remastered version with booklet is worth the money, hell yes! The bass on Live Wire cranked up will shake every picture off your wall."
4,"Not the ""original"" High Voltage or T.N.T. but...","...still rocks. The original 8-song 1974 release of High Voltage didn't actually contain the track 'High Voltage'. The cover of the original features a picture of an electricity power-box, with a dog 'cocking its leg' up against it, and certainly is still available on CD in Australia. The song 'High Voltage' wasn't featured until the follow-up 1975 release 'T.N.T.', a HUUUGE album which took Aust, NZ and the UK by storm. Any self-respecting Acka-Dacka purist would own these two instead of this one. The release on sale here is a conglomeration of songs taken from the 1974 High Voltage and the 1975 T.N.T., and was made for the US market which didn't discover AC/DC until ""later"". That said, these songs are the pure heart and soul of the REAL AC/DC. In my opinion the real AC/DC died with Bon Scott (may he ""Rock In Peace"")"
5,Classic rock at its best,"I loved this when I was a college student, and now my teen-aged son is enjoying it just as much!"
5,Cooler than a body on ice hotter than rolling dice,"Some bands material just gets better with age. High Voltage shows not only what was to come but much furhter beyond other bands AC/DC were in 1976. Angus already had his chops well rehearsed and Bon was already a force to be reckoned with. Sad that he was headed on a path to final destruction and death. This album is chalked full of classics destined for constant radio and LIVE rotation with T.N.T., Live Wire, The Jack, and Its a long Way to the Top"
4,"a legend is born, I guess","AC/DC are probably the most consistent rock band ever. Over a 25-year career they've made only minor changes to their sound, and despite musical trends coming and going, they've always maintained a steady level of popularity. This is where it starts. This American debut is actually a compilation of two earlier Australian-only albums. At this stage, AC/DC weren't as heavy as they would become. This is mostly blues-influenced bar band boogie, but the roots of the sound are in place. Everything's built upon simple, catchy guitar riffs. Lyrics are either raunchy sex, raunchy junior high humor or tales of hard living, topics that the band would rarely stray from in the future. Singer Bon Scott sings them in an alcoholic, gremlinish yelp while midget guitarist Angus Young hops around the stage in a schoolboy outfit. A legend is born, I guess."
2,"Rather uneven, but contains some good songs.","""It's A Long Way To The Top..."" (dig the bagpipe solo) and ""High Voltage"" are the two first rate songs on this album, the rest are just okay, or rather non-descript. Sort of like if Frank Zappa was a dentist in a Danish heavy metal band. ""The Jack"" goes on waaay too long. Not bad, but not great."
4,GREAT ALBUM,This a five star album. It contains Bon Scott and AC/DC going together for glory. But I cannot give it five stars. Why ?Because in reality this is compilation between two Australian AC/DC's releases: HIGH VOLTAGE and TNT. How their record company blended two great albuns together for release around the world ? Did they not trust the quality of the band enough ?
5,Bagpipes and Bon Scott !,"Bon Scott comes on like a dirty old man in a raincoat in ""Little Lover"". TNT is the AC/DC anthem (on this album anyway).""The Jack"" is subdued compared to the version on If You Want Blood... but hey it's all good."
3,I like the current lead singer,"This album is o.k., but I like the current lead singer more than the original. This album is sort of a historical look at the beginnings of AC/DC. There are always those who like the original and I understand that, as I usually do myself, but this is an exception for me. If you prefer the ""original"" thing, you would probably like this album a lot. By the way, is that bolt of lightning a phallic symbol or what? I think the guitar works much better in that role here, but the producers seem to want a double whammy of it on this cover.I love the guitar work of Angus, but I can tell he has gotten better with time, kinda like a good, cheap bottle of wine. I give this album a 7 on a scale of 10 if that helps."
2,mediocre rock that is fun once in a while....,"This album showcases everything I can't stand abut AC/dc. Repetitive riffs that suck(repetition is good if done right), annoying vocals, dumb lyrics, and song structures that bore the crap out of you. If you are a huge AC/DC fan you probably love this album. If you are like me and are not a big fan, stick with the Highway to Hell and Back and Black lps."
5,bagpipe in rock excellent,This cd has some very good songs from early ac/dc with Bon Scott. It is worth your pepsi points to get it. The bagpipe in the first song isvery exceptional
3,Does it sound better? Maybe. But contains an edited track!,"The new digipak ""High Voltage"" release was remastered by Sony. Does it sound good? Yes, it does. Does it sound any better than the 1994 remaster? I can't tell a difference, other than it being a little louder. The pictures in the liner notes of the original Australian ""High Voltage"" and ""TNT"" album releases are nice, but how often do you look at liner notes?Hardcore AC/DC fans be warned! The track ""It's a Long Way To the Top"" has been shortned by about 15 seconds. If you have the 1994 release, stick with that. The sound is just as good, and you'll have the full version of the song."
4,Filler keeps it from being a total killer,"""High Voltage"" is a compilation of the best stuff from the band's first two Aussie releases for American ears. The material is really strong up to ""T.N.T"" and then doesn't recover from the filler until the great title track closes things out....it's that 15 minutes or so that keeps the disc from being a classic.Not a bad place to start though not the best place either, it remains a great purchase and a good forcaster of the even better ""Let There Be Rock"".The rest of the material from the Aussie records was reassembled as ""Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap"" following Bon Scott's death in 1980."
5,high voltage music is born,"The geatest hard rock band of all time started out with their first real album TNT in 75 or so, renamed High Voltage when sent to the US, with exeption of the 'school days/shes got balls swich they were the same. This is awesome material!! Its a long way to the top is incredible with the quite sucessfully used bagpipes adding a cool sound. TNT, the staple here is one of the best metal songs of all time, with austrailian accent chants and the style the world would soon know and love of AC/DC. Live Wire is also really good but the whole disk is good, as always. A real must have."
5,FANTASTIC,"There is not one bad song on HIGH VOLTAGE. It starts with IT'S A LONG WAY TO THE TOP (IF YOU WANNA ROCK 'N' ROLL) - one of their best. Bon is great on this album and really lets rip on other songs such as LIVE WIRE & T.N.T.. This album slows down on a few tracks like the THE JACK, SHE'S GOT BALLS & the excellent LITTLE LOVER. A must have album."
5,Awesome reissue!,"Everything about this rules: The packaging, the booklet, the sound of the cd. This is the ultimate edition of this classic album & I haven't had a chance to access the additional stuff by computer yet, but I bet it's killer too! Very well done, Legacy!"
3,This is not the true HIGH VOLTAGE,"This CD deserves a higher rating, but I can't give that.THis album is, in true, a mix between the two first AC/DC albuns released in Australia: HIGH VOLTAGE (1975) and T.N.T. (1976).It has only two songs from the first and six from the second.ATLANTIC did that because they didn't trust AC/DC's real potential so far."
3,"it's ac/dc, what do you expect?","as everyone knows, ac/dc is three slamming chords, a simple 4/4 beat, a throat shredding vocalist, and a hyper active lead guitar. if you want more, go to frank zappa. this is about as primitive as you can get without actually dragging your knuckles on the ground. that said, ac/dc is clearly the greatest rock and roll band of all time. they rock, they swing, it's funny, and you can dance to it. this, they're first, has them finding their sound. its half great, half basic ac/dc, which isnt bad, but the songs just arent there yet. its a long way, livewire, tnt & high voltage belong with their greatest. bottom line: if you've gotten highway to hell, back in black and powerage, get this. if not, get the others first."
2,Didn't make much sense.,"The acting was awful. I thought, it would have been more of a love story, by the still pics they showed. I wouldn't watch it again."
1,awful,"It's not even worth the rent. The fight scenes are not even decent. Using the same spot over and over again? How's that supposed to make for a good fight? Could have been better? Tons. For one make the hits connect. Not one of the punches in this movie even looked like they connected. My thing is, if you're going to make a boxing movie, you got to be able to take some hits or in this case some punches. Garbage this movie was."
4,Can't go wrong with L'Amour,"I didn't rate this a 5 because it didn't hold my interest the way some of the other L'Amour books have. L'Amour holds true in this book to his theme of education, peace loving (unless forced to be otherwise) and a little romance.The book didn't pick up for me until the end."
5,MLK power of words,"Am collecting audios of greatest speeches in history; Listening to MLK you conclude that he was a great orator and a master of speech delivery. I am listening to greatest speeches in history, including Churchill, JFK, Reagan, Obama, Roosevelt and others. Churchill and MLK comes first with Obama in close proximity."
2,Picture gallery of authors work and not much more.,"I checked the reviews on Amazon before buying this book. One had one star and the other had five. Both described it well, but five stars is way excessive. I have been a wood turner for almost 40 years and know I could have done much better. The photography of the authors work is excellent. Beyond that, there is little to gain for even woodturners who are starting out. There are no techniques or tips, or description of the difficulty or ease of turning certain types of wood. Just pictures with mediocre creativity. I will be donating this book to my Woodworking Guild library. Hopefully they will take it."
5,311 - The masters of the rap rock sound! All hail the KINGS,"I will be brief. I don't want to take up too much of your time. Let me first say that 311 do not get their props for this rap rock revolution. They were there in the beginning kicking it hardcore. Now bands like Limp Bizkit yell and scream their way to the top of the charts with no talent to back it up.The new 311 album is their tightest yet. They have teamed up with the producer of their self-titled and best know album (the blue one for the non-fans!)This album is a great showcase for the muscianship that is contained within the band. Their instruments are all over the place. P-Nut is a bass genius on this record.What sets 311 apart from the other bands on this album is that they are not afraid of a groove or some nice harmony between Nick and SA. Its music, not just harsh noice.This is the tightest album of 311's career and one of the best of the year. I urge you to buy this album. You won't regret it!!"
3,311 Can Do Better Than This...Much Better...,"From Chaos is a cool cd and ive never been into the whole rap/rock craze that's goin on in the music scene today. 311's different and really do have their own sound and that's why I love this band. From Chaos has some really really high points and some low points. Songs like ""amber,"" ""champagne,"" and ""i told myself"" are great songs that I can listen to all day, but some of the songs on here are kinda corny and S.A. gets annoying at times, like in ""you wouldn't believe,"" the part where S.A. comes in to rap is just unnecessary and it would sound tighter if he didn't have to keep jumping in the song. I don't have anything against the guy, but some songs would be better off if he was just spinning records and not rapping. 311 beats listening to bands like papa roach and limp bizkit anyday, but they seems to be losing their edge on this album and I hope on the next cd, they get things goin in the right direction again."
4,"Get this Album and Say ""HEADRUSH""","I've been a 311 fan for the past few years and I thought this album was very decent. I heard the featured single ""You wouldn't believe"" on the radio and I wasn't that impressed, so I wasn't that keen on getting the album. But I did because, hey, it's 311 and their songs always grow on me after a while. I agree with people that you need to listen to this album more than once to appreciate some of the songs, but when you do, you can really get into them. It's back to the good ol' days when you often have no clue what SA is saying until you look up the lyrics, but Nick's lyrics in this album show that 311 is definitely not lacking in self-esteem. I'm not a huge fan of the last three songs because I prefer the hard stuff, but 311 are still ""Sick Tight"" and I would recommend getting the album just for that song because it seriously rocks like no other song on the album!"
4,Much better than any of their recent CDs,"Overall, From Chaos is a very good CD. It has a flow from beginning to end that I found was lacking in Transistor and Soundsystem-all the songs blend together well, similar to their first album, Music. The opening track is great. Fans of Music and Grassroots will appreciate 311's latest effort."
5,From Chaos brings chaos to my ears because of 311,ive been waiting for their new cd to come out. since im a die hard fan of them its obvious that im going to give it 5 stars. but im my opinoion its a diffrent album than soundsystem and grassroots ect. but it brings quality that the boys from omaha can only bring. its a cd you must buy for any 311 fan.
1,simply terrible,"i have been listening to 311 since 1995. i loved them back then, and as time goes on they seem to get worse and worse. this album is proof of that fact. it is their worst effort yet, and i am both saddened and disappointed. i would advise anyone thinking about buying this album to not waste their money."
4,Uneven,"I am a huge 311 fan. They are my favortite band for many reasons..From Chaos i believe is thier weakest album..The first half of the album i never could get into and i find myself always skipping to the later tracks...I still think this is a great album, but songs like you get worked and full ride have to be my least favorite 311 songs, and brings down the album as a whole..however, songs like uncalm and wake your mind up kick offer much better listens..I always thought of this album as a b-side to the blue album. Def. there weakest of thier 8 studio recordings..grassroots and transistor being the top 2"
2,311 Loses Their Beat on this CD,"While I was reading these reviews, I was amazed at how many people raved that 'From Chaos' was the best album since their self-titeld release. You people cannot be true 311 fans if you think this CD even compares to 'Music' or the Blue Album. Soundsystem was a great CD with a fresh 311 sound, but on From Chaos, there are only a handful of songs that I consider 311 worthy. Songs like 'You Get Worked', 'I Told Myself', and 'Sick Tight', are just knock offs of the Blue Album. From Chaos, Amber, Hostile Apostle and Full Ride are the only songs that reflect 311's style. All in all, I'd say that From Chaos is my least favorite 311 CD, but it is worth the money if you are a real fan."
2,uuuuuuuuugggggghhhhhhhhhhh,"I found this CD, actually not mine, and at first I thought it really rocked, but the more I listened the more all the music seemed become a blur of noise...nothing very memorable save Amber, maybe. Don't buy this CD, save your money. I don't feel this music at all..its just annoying with that ""SA"" guy who can't rap at all...the high nasal whinning sounds of Eminem or something...and Nicks voice is so monotonus, sounds lika robot. Anyway theres not much to this CD, just the same old same old. Either their pushing it too much or boring the [stuff]out of you. Pretty [bad]. Don't bother. Oh, and by the way, No Doubt and RHCP ARE way better, I'd buy their stuff over this."
5,Finally...,"Hands down the best 311 album in my book is Music. So you can imagine my disgust with recent albums such as Transistor and Soundsystem (slightly better than the former). The 311 album obviously opened the door for the band to the public, since I feel they have played for the ""trendies"". From Chaos is a return to the ""style I came from"" and didn't let me down anywhere near as much as I expected. If you like recent 311 stuff then this isn't for you, if you have been missing the old school jams, well this is probably about as close as we will get again."
4,Coming Original Once Again,"After five studio releases and a live album, 311 has trekked across a wide spectrum of genres: from rock to reggae, funk to alternative, and even some electronic. With ""From Chaos"", 311 returns to the grassroots rock-and-roll that got them started, while keeping it fresh and original with some experimental electronic and reggae. With songs like ""You Wouldn't Believe"", ""I'll Be Here Awhile"", and the title track ""From Chaos"", the band's optimistic attitude and laid back demeanor shine through in their 6th studio release of what will be a long and prosperous musical career. Congrats to the Omaha boys on another great album and keep on rockin'."
5,Another Fine Work From 311,"This CD shines as all the rest have, but if you are lookin for something completely new compared to their other albums I'm sorry on this one. If you like this CD other 311 CDs you should get are 311-311(blue album) & 311-Grassroots. Check out this CD!"
2,mediocre at best,"A fellow Nebraskan, I felt obligated to help out someone from my own state trying to continue earning a living by making music. But I have to say buying ""From Chaos"" was a terrible waste of fifteen dollars .311 is continuing to make playful funk-rap music that started in the early 90's and has since been beat to death by numerous bands. None of the lyrics are rememberable and the guitar hooks seem outdated and worn out. When the group tries to make a ballad of sorts on ""Amber"" it just makes me wince. Of course Nebraska isn't exactly a hotbed of funk music, so 311 probably didn't do too bad with the influences they grew up with. But this isn't a good album and I really wish I hadn't of wasted money on it."
3,meh...not the best,"ive been a fan of 311 since i was still in about 1st or 2nd grade. and when i heard this album i was a little disapointed. i didnt get into right away like all of the other albums and it just didnt seem that great. all in all, i only really liked only 2 of the songs and some others were alright. its growing on me sloooly though. i just dont think its as good as any of there others. ive heard some of there new stuff from Evolver and it sounds pretty good though. Ill have to definately check that out."
3,Pretty Good. Nothing Great,"This cd is pretty good. Some tracks will please any 311 fan. The hard truth in my opinion is that there are no great songs on this album; just a bunch of pretty good songs. If you were to compile a 311 greatest hits cd, these tracks would all hit the cutting room floor.There just does not seem to be the same synchronization and blend between Nick's and SA's voices on the ""rock"" songs like they possessed on Music, Grassroots, or self-titled. The end-result is that the lyrics in the songs blaringly stand out and their sometimes less than poetic nature is exposed.I have hardly given up on the band though. As a fan who has all their records and been to multiple concerts, I was encouraged by the B-side track ""Bomb the Town"" that didn't make it onto this disc. It possessed the fluid energy rock and up-tempo rapping that got me hooked on the band in the first place. This track is on the bonus EP included with their latest home video."
4,From Chaos Comes Clarity,"Quite possibly the best effort from the boys from Omaha. A throwback to the breakthrough ""blue"" album, 311 went back to the hard edge sing-songy sound that made them famous on tracks like ""Down"" and ""All Mixed Up"". From Chaos' first single ""You Wouldn't Beleive"" has the melodic tunes you'd expect from this dance-hall band. ""You Get Worked"" gets back to the power chord roots and live show feel of a 311 concert, in fact, the whole album was recorded in a ""live"" setting to get that on stage magic that is much of the mysitique of a 311 live show.If you are a fan of 311, or just want to be on the next big thing, I'd suggest checking out From Chaos. It's 40 minutes of pure positive vibes from our ""good buds"" from Omaha."
3,Kinda disappointed long time fan,"Their new cd is ok at best.Unfortunately Im an old fan from Music and Grassroots. this isnt the same band that wrote those cd's. this is the same band that wrote soundsystem.This cd is a little too pop and radio friendly for me I think. the cd does have some high points but has as many songs that I prefer not to listen to. If you liked soundsystem, you will probably like this release."
2,Not very good...,"I'm not a 311 hater, it's just that I think this cd has a lot of filler. I borrowed it, because I liked the song Amber (and still do) and thats probably the only song I enjoyed on the cd. His voice can get annoying after a while. I don't really like it."
4,you guys aren't good at racing games,"When mastered, the controls aren't bad.You guys complain too much, making a huge deal about every single flaw.Why don't you find a game that's ""easier"" for you since it seems like that you can't handle the skill it takes to play a game like Drive Emotion Type-S."
1,Ok this game is so bad that i got a virus after playing it,"I hate this game, absolutely hate it. I hate it so bad that whenever I turned it off I threw up. I had the flu for a week. Don't get me wrong, I've tried to like this game so much that I played for a day. I have never hated a game, or even dislike one, but this one I hate a lot."
1,Very bad,"When playing with 2 players, the screen shakes every now and then.The road doesn't change it's speed to reflect the car speed.Very poor simulations.Fortunately, I rented it :)"
1,"not released, haven't played, but I'll review it anyway","The first person to review this game doesn't own it (probably because it's not been released yet), and hasn't played it, but has decided to write a review on it anyway. Yes, I often make my decision on where to eat after reading reviews of people who ACTUALLY HAVE NOT BEEN THERE, AND HAVE NOT EATEN ANY OF THEIR FOOD. Does this seem slightly absurd to you?At least the second reviewer has ACTUALLY PLAYED THE GAME. Let's see, who would I trust more--one who has played it or one who has NOT played it? Well let's see--which mechanic would you choose--one that is qualified, or one who doesn't even ACTUALLY own tools? Which Doctor would you choose? One who is not only qualified and has performed well for many years, or someone that just ""PLAYS A DOCTOR ON TV""?.YOU DECIDE."
3,wait for gt3,I rented this game from Blockbuster last week and I agree with the general consensus that it is way too difficult to control. For the first 3 days i had it i struggled in just getting the car to go in a straight line. After playing with the menu controls and the setup options i finally got the car under rough control (set up all of your suspension options to hard). The graphics are incredible though and there is a pretty good sensation of speed. I didn't think the gameplay itself was that great though. This game only whetted my appetite for GT3.
2,This game is stupid,I rented this game about 2 days ago and returned it yesterday. THE CONTROLLS ARE TERRIBLE! It feels like the cars are floating. The only reason why it got 2 stars is because the graphics are great and the cars are cool. I can't believe Squaresoft made this. There games are always good. Just wait for Gran Turismo 3.
1,There are better Driving Games out there!!!,"Alright, i love driving games!! Especially ones that look at feel like driving a real car. This game falls short on all counts. The graphics for the game are impressive, but that is about it. No attention to driving details. Steering reacts like you are driving a go-cart, and handling is very unrealistic. The problem lies in the fact that when the car turns it pivots from the exact center of the car. instead of the front wheels pulling the car in the diretion of the turn..If you like driving games and want to spend your money on a driving game, go get Ridge Racer V, or GT3. This one is a waste of time..."
4,I like my new kitchen aid mixer!,"I owned a 5 quart kitchen aid stand mixer for 26 years. It was in constant use. I started making bread and this mixer simply wasn't powerful enough. This professional powerful mixer handles bread dough and other heavy duty mixing very well. I read many of the other reviews and was somewhat apprehensive of my purchase. I have found that like any other small appliance; it took a little time to get used to the difference between the mixers. I like this machines extra capacity,power, and stability. This mixers bowl can be raised or lowered closer, or further ,to beatens simply by turning a screw in the front of the stand which solves some of the scraping problem mentioned in one reveiw. On the negative side-this machines beater's do not rotate as fast as my previous mixers. I wish it was faster but overall I enjoy this machine and like the extra power and capacity. Sincerely, Gail Benjamin-Albuquerque, NM"
2,Very disappointed,"I've had a 350 watt, 5 qt, Kitchenaid mixer for 25 years that still works perfectly. When I saw this more powerful one, I decided to buy it--solid state, bigger bowl, more power for bread dough, plus mine was harvest gold color--yechh.I was so disappointed in this new model: it's much noisier and doesn't seem to mix as well (need to scrape more often, even though the beaters are perfectly positioned); the design of the handle on the bowl is most uncomfortable when trying to carry with one hand or empty batter into the baking pan.Unfortunately, I'd given my old one away, but I am so disappointed in the new one that I've purchased the 5-qt Commercial model and am getting rid of this new one.Still, I would probably recommend this model if you make BIG batches or a lot of bread and need the extra power and capacity."
5,glad I finally got my dream machine!,"I worked with my first KitchenAid stand mixer in college in the early 80's. From that time until Christmas 2002, I never managed to have the money to break down and purchase the machine. After looking at all the models, power levels, etc., I decided to spend the extra dollars and get the 6 quart stand mixer. I am so glad I did!Many times, I have had cookie dough batters up to the rim of the bowl. The machine makes my life so much easier preparing bread dough, mixing cookie batter, slinging together a batch of pancakes, or just simply whipping egg whites for a meringue.I do recommend purchasing an extra bowl (as I did) for your mixer. The price tag might seem a bit steep, but the number of times I have put the second bowl to use has made it a value. There have been many times that I have had both bowls in use while preparing meals."
3,Bread making,"My 6 qt kitchenaid only lasted a month over one year. It is made with nylon gears rather than metal. I make bread at least once a week. I use my mixer for lots of stuff and pretty much everyday. My old kitchenaid still works beautifully and is 20 years old.I wanted the larger size so I thought I was upgrading. NOT. I am sorry that Whirlpool bought out kitchenaid, apparently profit margins are too important to warrant ""top shelf"" quality for upper end prices and expectations."
1,Plastic gears!!!!,"Sorry to disagree with most folks. My wife's mixer blew the nylon worm gear. Correspondence with the company offered no assistance except to infer that it was somehow her fault. She is very careful with her extensive collection of kitchen tools..All the company did was to say how disappointed they were (translation: It's your fault, our mixers are perfect), and that gear would only break if the machine had been mistreated, and then ""Here are three parts suppliers"". The closest of these is 110 miles away.All I can say, is God help you if the machine breaks down; It's darn sure Kitchenaid will not.They build a Porsche and put in a VW Beetle transmission...BTW....Plastic and grease, over time, do not mix well."
1,"Kitchen Aid Pro six, nix.","I really expected to love my pro six, since for thirty years I have had a kitchen aid model 45, which still works fine, but is harvest gold. I bake a lot, so the old one has had hard use. Alas, I have nothing good to say about the new kitchen aid (Pro six) except that it looks good on my counter. I find it inconvenient to use, the attachments are not as nice, and most important of all it has deficient power! I was looing forward to making larger batches of things, but the new one will not even do as well as the old one with small loads. I took one back because it made such a horrible noise when I tried kneading dough. The store replaced it, but the second one is no better. Unfortunately I waited beyond the warranty to do anything about it so I'm stuck. The pro six sits there, and I use the old harvest gold one."
5,"Everything I hoped for, and more!","For a very long time, we thought about getting this mixer and simply procrastinated because of the cost. However, we recently decided the time was right, and we bought it. What a good decision that was. We put it to use within hours of it being delivered and have been even more pleased than we imagined. I have not found the noise to be all that bad, and our experience has been that it is not necessary to scrape the bowl most of the time. The only downside is that we will be doing a lot more baking - and that means we will need to also spend more time on the treadmill. But it is worth it. It's hard to imagine anyone having this mixer and being anything less than delighted. It is one of the best cooking-related decisions we have made."
2,Not a Better Machine.,"I purchased this mixer just after this past Christmas as a ""present"" to myself. Wow, finally a Kitchenaid with lots of power. I agree with others in that I think it is cumbersome. Every time I turn and pull down the beaters to remove them I get full of gook. I find the bowl difficult to remove and I don't think that it mixes well; a lot of scraping necessary. It is great for bread kneeding; that's about it though. Now I feel stuck as it did not come at a cheap price. Give me my mom's ol Hamilton Beach. That was a mixer."
5,KITCHENAID,"I HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING THIS PRODUCT FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS. THE KITCHENAID PROFFESSIONAL MIXER IS THE BEST I HAVE EVER USED! IT REALLY LIVES UP TO ALL OF MY EXPECTATIONS. IT HAS EVERYTHING POWER,CAPACITY AND IT LOOKS GREAT AND IS EASY TO CLEAN ALSO I THINK THE BEST ATTRIBUTE OF THE KITCHENAID IS THE WARRANTY, WHICH IS GOOD FOR ONE YEAR FROM THE PURCHASE DATE AND IS FULLY REPLACEABLE FROM THE COMPANY. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO IS LOOKING FOR A QUALITY MIXER."
2,Disappointed,"Thought about buying the 325 watt machine, but wanted the something more powerful so I could just cruise through smaller batches without the chance of straining the motor. Bought the 525 watt version, set it up adjusted everything according to the manual and started mixing a single batch of toll house cookies. But the machine was sluggish even when I took it to full power. Seemed to only have about 1/4 the strength of my Bosch. Took it back the next day. Beautiful appliance. Thinking about trying another one, maybe I got a lemon."
5,ONE OF THE BEST INVESTMENTS EVER MADE!,"In the past, I wondered why anyone would WANT one of these, much less hand over the cash to obtain one. But now, after owning mine for about 3 months, I can honestly say it was one of the best investments I ever made. I can't imagine living without it. It handles a large part of mundane prep work, and simplifies cooking (making even large batches of pie crust, cookie dough and homemade pasta is virtually EFFORTLESS). I would HIGHLY recommend this product (and its associate attachments)to both those who love to cook, and those who have not yet developed their culinary expertise."
3,Not what I expected,"I bought the Kitchen Aid Professional because of the 525 watt power rating, I mix a lot of bread and other similar dough. I took it home and immediately whipped up a couple of loaves of bread. Next morning I went to use the mixer and nothing happened (burned out motor). The replacement is working fine after 1 year but I no longer knead more than 1 loaf of bread dough at a time. Even with 1 loaf in the mixer it really strains and I fear burning out another motor. My Bosch, purchased at a much lower price, will knead 2 - 3 times the volume of dough without straining at all."
4,Love those mixers!!,"I own two of the KitchenAid mixers and would never give up either one. I use the 4 1/2 qt. mixer for smaller batches (and I really like the tilt head) and my 6 qt. for double or triple batches. I have never had a problem with either one. They're both about six years old. If I could change just one thing on the 6 qt. mixer, it would be to have a tilt head. It would make scraping and cleaning the beaters much easier. That's why I only gave this product 4 stars. Thank you. Jan in Northern Michigan."
5,review of kitchaid mixer,"It makes breads and baking so easy. Whip cream and maraingue (sp)is a sinch. The one thing that is hard, is that you have to have plenty of room on your counter but I would gladly loose a couple of inches on my counter for this machine."
2,Jury Still Out,"I purchased my KitchenAid Pro 6 last year and have only used it 5 times. Today, after about 5 minutes of mixing, it smoked a little and shutdown. It's supposed to have a thermal reset function, but it appears it didn't work. It will not come back on even after waiting several hours.I will be seeking technical assistance and finding out how much repairs will cost. If it's too much, I'll have to trash the unit."
2,Very disappointing.,I LOVED the 4.5 quart KitchenAid Mixer but decided to go with this larger unit. The design itself is just awkward. The head or top piece is stationary unlike that found on smaller models. It becomes much more difficult to use. KitchenAid has taken its original ergonomic delight and ruined it. Stay with the 5 quart mixer: it works the same old wonderful way as the original.
1,KitchenAid no longer a top-quality product,"If you are a serious cook, especially a bread enthusiast, don't be fooled by the ""Professional"" implication of the name. This mixer cannot handle even a moderate batch of substantial bread. I went through three units (2 burned out motors and one unstable mixer head, all objectionably loud) in the period of one year before abandoning the brand altogether. After many hours of internet searching I settled on a Magic Mill (Electrolux, made in Sweden) Kitchen Assistent. It is a truly superior piece of kitchen equipment that has handled every task I've sent its way, quietly and reliably. It was a far better buy, even though more expensive, than the KitchenAid. I anticipate that it is the last mixer I will ever need to buy."
3,"Good mixer, but maybe not for bread bakers","I owned one of these for over a year, using it almost exclusively for bread dough. I found that I could not completely process a batch bigger than 4 cups of flour, and even then the motor would stall quite frequently once the dough began to reach the finished state (which is exactly when the mixer would be the most useful). Eventually, after a day on which I prepared four loaves, the motor simply failed.To their credit, Kitchenaid sent me a brand new ""Artisan"" model mixer, and explained that they were not yet replacing the big machines due to some engineering problems (which I'm pretty sure were unrelated to my issues; something about confectioner's sugar gumming up the on-off switch).If you're making cookie dough and primarily using the whisks or the main beater, the Kitchenaid is a great machine. ...."
3,Gear Problems,I've read a lot of kitchenaid mixer reviews complaining about the gears being made of plastic and getting messed up pretty easily. I've noticed recently that all of the tags on these in the store make a very visable point that the gears are steel. Has anyone had any gear problems with the all steel model?
3,"Actual ""Death"" experience","Tom Sawyer dies, goes to Heaven and talks to God. Then he comes back and starts being a better person. Pretty good read, slow start. I enjoyed his own way of talking about waking up to his own spirituality."
1,Not so good,"First, let me say, I'm a huge fan of NR. This book just wasn't as good as most of her other stories. I just couldn't get into the storyline and felt the book was lacking some depth."
1,Great Product horrible seller,"The heading for this product clearly states that you get 6 per case and i only received one per order. Normally when you read something and it says you are getting 6 per case you would expect to see 6 per order, but instead i was fooled and wasted my time ."
5,suncat,"I use this 3M auto wax on my 2002 Corvette-It is by far, the easiest wax to apply and it gives me a shine that has helped me win First Place in The Shadow of theMountain Corvette Concours show in Leavenworth, Washington in July 2010."
1,This Stinks!!!,A Great disappointment. At first I was happy to see the combination of two great groups so I ran and bought a copy. A great disappointment followed as the tracks on this CD sound NOTHING like the orginal recordings. These are songs that remind me of good times in the past when I was a child growing up and took an early interest in listening to music. Someone got greedy and made a mess. You can stop them from choking on their greed by NOT wasting your money on this product.
3,Average,"If you already own ""Surrender"" and ""STGA"" dont buy this album. Mostly is another compilation of previous songs."
4,Encore Please!,"Well, I do not own Surrender. So I thought Encore was the perfect follow up to The Andrew Lloyd Webber Collection which contains his most famous songs.Encore is kind of refreshing to me as I have not heard any of the tracks besides Think Of Me from Phantom Of The Opera. Reworkings such as With One Look from Sunset Boulevard and Memory from Cats - are both sung here in Italian.I especially like Away From You from Rex and Whistle Down The Wind as these are sung with a lovely lilt. Look out for other rare and unreleased tracks like One More Walk Around The Garden, What More Do I Need and In The Mandarin's Orchid Garden.This is great record for quiet Saturday afternoons where you can hear Sarah weave her vocal magic around these songs. Encore keeps growing on me each time I listen to it!"
4,"I'm so sorry for that ""Music Fan""...","I didn't know Sydney, Australia is such a culture desert. Sarah is the one and only diva that can interpret the songs so delicately. It's not only because of the high notes, her young voice, romantic lyrics, orchestral music, theatrical magic... it's the emotion that penetrates you until it [stinks] up your soul. Someone compares it with a spiritual experience. I say it's an addiction.I like ""Nothing Like You've Ever Known"" and ""Whistle Down the Wind"". This album has many songs that I've already had, so I only give it 4 stars. The albums ""Time to Say Goodbye"", ""Eden"" and ""La Luna"" are the must-see. (Or should I say... the must-listen, must-own...)Enjoy the richness of Sarah's music. If you can't comprehend, I feel sorry for you."
3,NOT HER BEST BUT STILL GOOD,"This CD is not Sarah's best, but it is still pretty good. I'm looking forward to her next thematic offering more on the line of La Luna. Eden is still her best, however. I'd like to see some new stuff, and get away from the broadway musicals for good. Still Sarah has a tremendous voice and a fantastic body, take a gander of her photos in the Classics CD, and I love both, but would like something new too."
1,encoe cd by sarah brightman,sarah brightmans new encore just rocks. buy it today its number one with clarabelle collins infact i do listen to it all of the time. been a very faithful fan of sarahs for so many years now. i think she is a great singer and. also a nice lady my big dream is to meet her inperson someday. if iam lucky enough to but who knows its a small world after all. yours truly clarabelle
3,Shirts Run Small,I returned all the Dickie Shirts and did not re-order. These run very small and somewhat look cheap. This was a nice color though.
3,Average but normal Obituary,"I like Obituary. I really do. The only thing holding them back is the same songs over and over. This sounds very similar to ""The End Complete"", production and all. Allen West's solos have gotten downright BORING. I don't think he has any talent at playing lead.The one saving grace about this album is that Trevor Peres can come up with pretty decent riffs. They aren't the best; however, they get the job done. The drumming is normal for Donald Tardy, nothing spectacular, yet, nothing underwhelming either. The vocals are even more distinguishible.I don't hate this album, I just had higher expectations of it. If you like Obituary, get it. If you are trying to get into them, get ""Cause of Death"" instead."
4,A good comeback,"I, like most thought Obituary had broke up err sumthin... but nope, they're back, and still pretty damn good. Some songs a bit ont he repetative side, but at least they have the same overall death metal sound!!!! Welcome back"
2,"Frozen in ""Back from the Dead"" Time","I really think the album is a sequel to their last studio release Back From the Dead. Nothing new, a little boring, and not what I expected from a reunion album. I bought the album expecting to refresh some albums like Cause of Death, The End Complete and Slowly we Rot, and it did, in a very small way.Still , the album has great tracks... My favorite track is Lockjaw because it kind of mixes two Obituary stages through the years ""Cause of Death"" to ""World Demise"", On the Floor sounds a lot like Back to One from ""The End Complete"", and Slow Death is a good headbanging track. I'm really glad theyre back though, since Obituary is one of my favorite Death Metal bands. But we have to give credit where credit is due, and having bands like Vader and Dismember still around, we can see that the original essence can be kept. Not enough effort (in staying fresh, that is)."
2,Very Redundant,"I was never a huge Obituary fan, but I liked their albums a bit. This one is pretty redundant though. A lot of the songs could almost be instrumentals. The riffs are definitely Alan West, but have little variation. John Tardy's vocals are better this time, he enunciates well. Overall, Obituary deliver a passable, if uncreative take on purist Death Metal with their trademark sound, but that's all."
4,Company President (small co.),We use it after gathering for sociial engagements. It is fun and sometimes eye opening. Great to have
2,Just Basic not ver accurate,The product is not very Accurate if I could I would invest more in a more accurate product. Just a basic product
4,Fun gift idea,"Bought this as a gift for my husband and it turned out to be a fun idea. While it didn't seem to be 100% accurate, he had a great time using it and will continue to use it in the future. The one reason it may not have been entirely accurate may have to do with the fact that you have to calibrate it at a time when you haven't had a drink within 48 hours, and as a third ear law student, that never seems to happen. But still probably one of the best middle of the road breathalyzers out there."
1,Worthless,"This product did Not work for us. We followed the directions to properly calibrate the device, but when it came to trying to get the breathalyzer to register, it was inaccurate. We tried numerous times, but the device would either not register, or would register a result and then within 5 minutes the result would be drastically different (example from .10 to .04). We decided that a better resource is to use good judgement versus the breathalyzer and Not drive after consuming any more than 1 drink. (We were attempting to see if we would 'know' when our blood alcohol level was above a .08, but the device certainly did not assist with the process.) Maybe a more expensive device would be more reliable. However - Amazon was very prompt about refunding our $30, and the return process was easy."
4,small and conveinent,"this is a small device that is pretty accurate. I used this for my education class to show them how alcohol is used different products & how easy it would be to get a D.U.I. but the true fact remains that if you have just 1 drink, you will be arrested. So just don't drink and drive. R. Anderson"
3,Conversation Piece,"It is small, and can give you a wide range of BAC levels. This is all due to the fact that it depends on how close you hold it to your face. It has to be a certian distance with a certain force of breath. It is fun for a party but not much more than that if you want an accurate reading."
5,Bought for a Gift,I bought this item for a gift for my little brother for his 21st birthday. He got a kick out of it and used it at his party. I just wanted to make sure he was being safe and this is one way to do so. If you follow the directions it works well.
1,I wish i could give a negative star rating,"This did not work, blew 0.00 after 12 drinks..does not work and you should not buy it, this is a scam....they should not be able to sell it"
1,HORRIBLE --DOES NOT WORK DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,DO NOT BUY --INACCURATE READINGS..HAVE 2 BEERS AT .9 HAVE 10 RUM AND COKES .2
3,Works Good Enough,I purchased this breathalyzer for curiosity and I am not quite sure how accurate it is. The breathalyzer needs to be calibrated more than once and I'm not exactly sure how I like that you just blow into the top of it.
5,I just tried it for the first time. It's easy to use and a perfect size!,"I bought this for fun, and also to have with me just in case. Sometimes an uptight friend gives me a hard time, so this is to prove my innocence!"
2,Not the best.,"I tested this unit against a police issue DOT approved Alco Sensor IV. Readings were inconsistent. If you want true accuracy so your reading would match a Police Officers reading... it is imperative you get a unit that contains a fuel cell and is DOT approved.You are gonna pay $450-$750 for such a unit, but how much is a DUI?"
4,Kept my intrest..,"I actually purchased this movie..watched it the first time..was ok..rewatched it 2 days later..and liked it better..I am a fan of Westerns..favorite being Lonesome Dove..I don't rate this up there with it..however, it wasn't a waste of time or money.."
3,dawnrider,It was an interesting movie but if they would have used someone like Kevin Costner or a better lead actor the movie could have resulted in a terrific movie
5,"Excellent book, fills in all gaps left out by Gabriel Catts.","This excellent book fills in all the gaps left out by Gabriel Catts in the previous book, MY BROTHER MICHAEL. It gives Myra's view of the story and makes you understand her a lot more. I loved it!"
1,I can't believe I paid for this!,"I've gotten better reports out of my middle school child!This isn't even a book, it's paper in a cheap plastic binding ring. The printing on the page is off to one side every now and then, the spelling errors are unbelieveable. I don't think there was any editing on this book whatsoever! The book is totally based on a MAN getting the job. What a MAN should wear to the interview. Even tells you how to pick out the correct tie to go with your perfect suit. But never, talks about a woman getting the job. I totally feel this is sexist and I'm VERY disappointed! Do NOT buy this book!"
1,very bad,please some body call me at 510-791-2002. you have charged me for this item and never send me the merchandize. either send it or refound my money.
2,title of review,"These guys demonstrate a reasonable grasp of melodic death metal but their undeniable emo and nu-metal influnces water it down rather than adding a catchy pop element that works. The wussy monotonous mid-tempo drumming on every song drains the music of a lot of potential intensity. This is some of the most boring drumming you'll ever hear from a metal band, and it plays a significant part in relegating this band to the boring conventional mainstream drivel category. 5/10.If you want a metalcore album that will really kick your speakers in, check out the self-titled album from With Resistance. At least listen to it before you give me a not helpful vote, I'm trying to help you out here."
5,Uh.... Absolutely sick.... Brutal....,"Wow! I first heard this band on the music choice channel and immediately I purchased their EP. The EP has only 5 songs on it, but they were played continuously. I consider myself a very diverse music listener. I love hip hop, jazz, you name it. If it has heart, feeling and emotion then it is artwork to me. ""Of Love and Lunacy"" is an amazing record. It is so well-rounded that it has something for all ears to enjoy. I have owned this cd for two weeks and it has not left my player once. In fact, this cd has made my personal work-outs last from one and a half hours, to two and a half all by itself. The cd just makes you want to burst out of your shell and take on the world, in a positive Christian way. This cd is so amazing that it could take Red Bull, Rock Star and every other energy drink out of business. This cd will be the caffeine you need to stay awake and revitalized. Sick!"
4,it's a winner.,"This album takes you in with catchy songs such as ""If love was born to die"". Their screaming style is very much compared to that of Haste The Day. Their songs are ""metal"" (if you will) at times, and yet melodic with the use of a keyboard.I love this band and i suggest you purchase this release. Infact...i'm going to go see them play live this sunday."
5,Awesome,"Here is a simple review. Do you like metal. If so then get this cd. I had just recently found out about Still Remains and was very impressed. So go buy Still Remains, Soilworks new one, Mudvaynes new one,It Dies Today and definitely buy Triviums new one."
5,A bit of fresh air for metalcore!,"Still Remains are like taking a little bit of Atreyu, Unearth, and a little KsE and mix it up and out comes Still Remains. This is a very good cd, not the most original, but none the less good. They really know how to play their instruments and it shows. Heavy song with melodic choruses. Stand out songs are #2,4,5, and 10, but every song is a standout on here, except #7 (I hate fillers) Overall this is one of the better cds to come out thus far in 2005! \m/\m/"
2,i would of liked this cd but.........,"this band would be great if they didnt have THE FREAKING KEYBOARDS. it is annoying they come on during the would havebeen cool breakdowns.if you are a metalcore fan like me andyou dont mind the keyboards buy it, you might like it but iwill stick with as i lay dying and there keyboard free c.d"
2,Two stars for one reason...,"""White Walls"" is one of the greatest American metalcore songs I've ever heard. Otherwise, this is formulaic, European influenced ""scream-verses, sing-choruses"" metalcore. I will say they are better than bands like Atreyu (only slightly-they are both pretty good at an overdone form of music) and It Dies Today (worst metalcore band in history.)"
3,decent unremarkable entry in the snyth metal core,"after hearing their intensity shgine through onm the one true great track on their EP,driving guiatrs, progresive tones, powe4r house drumming,demonic growls, anmd dramatic synths. On their major label debut the band atempt to make the best of their lack of scope in turn for catchyiness and heaviness. The band never quite getsheavy enough, the production job sucks. Thgrough though the band sounds tight enough in spots churning out familiar riffage, and colorful synths. The vocals are garbled growls and filtered harmonies.The band seem to hit the catchiness high with ""white walls"" and seem to reahc heaviness with the new version of ""recovery"". Theres no memorable songs beyond that. But that push enough drive into some of the songs to make lsitenable enough to make for an entry point effrt"
2,"Cheap and Nasty, but it works","A light in my garage went out, and this fixture was cheaper than replacing the ballast in the existing fixture. I thought, ""how bad can it be?"" Answer is . . . pretty bad. Very cheap construction and the parts did not fit together particularly well. No instructions were provided, but having done this several times that was not a real problem for me. The metal bends VERY easily, so be careful when installing it.That being said, it does work, and so far no annoying hum.If you want the cheapest alternative, this will work, but I would suggest spending a few dollars more (maybe $5) and getting something a bit better made. Halfway through installation, I considered replacing the ballast in the old fixture rather than installing this mess, but I was too lazy to deal with the delay and returning this fixture."
3,Buy local,"The box was damaged, the light was bent and a few days later we saw the same fixture at Ace Hardware for less money."
2,DANGER Will Robinson!!!,Use EXTREME caution when handling these light fixtures. They are made of stamped & folded sheet metal and the edges are razor sharp!!!These light fixtures are very cheaply made. There is no power cord and the method of assembling the housing is adequate at best (tabs into slits). If this isn't an issue for you then these fixtures will do the job. Just watch those edges!
4,It is what it is and will make do like other reviewers,"Can't get high quality fixtures anymore, USA lost that years ago. A bit hesitant about ordering this based on other reivews, but it is exactly what we needed and a value price because there is nothing I could find comparable that was any better quality. Ours came in OK, could have been packaged a little better, but no major harm done. Slight bend in metal that easily bent ""back"". Installed fine & has been working well for months now."
1,Merchandise so shoddy it is dangerous and should not be sold anywhere,"This lighting fixture is of such shoddy quality, it is not even safe. My superintendent begged me not to install it, as it would probably fall apart when I needed to change the bulb. The plastic ends holding the bulb were so flimsy he was worried. As we were packing it up, I cut my hand on the thin, improperly finished razor-sharp metal that the whole thing is made of. I was still bleeding as I called Amazon to complain. This item should not be sold to the public by any responsible retailer."
5,We Love It !!!!!!,"We have the Verona Mogul rug, and we love it! We are so sad that it is no longer available. If the Mogul or the Agra became available we would definitely buy another one, immediately. We're constantly checking the website to see if it's back in stock. Great product!!!!"
3,Hardest game ever,"Wow... what can anybody say about this game... It's so much fun... You attack by throwing your limbs at people until you're a bouncing body looking for your arms and legs. the music is enjoyable too. The only bad part is that it is a very hard game. It's up there with Friday the 13th as Hardest games ever that I'll probably never beat, but I do enjoy it very much!"
5,"What A ""Novel"" Concept!","This author has taken an unsettling subject (war) & approached it in a way that gives one hope. Should our World Leaders read this book, the future will most assuredly be a better place to live! The illustrations round out the insightfullness, and make it a pleasure to read time and again. Has A distinct ""One Tin Soldier"" feel & message to it. I'm looking forward to more from Noah."
4,Kingsmen - 'Live & Unreleased' (Jerden Records) 4 1/2 stars,"'Live & Unreleased' is a superb archive live recording of the pioneers of frat rock {if you care to call them that}. Taped over a two-night stand of gigs from November, 1964 (although the band's site indicates it was 1963). Pretty much every one of this CD's fourteen cuts rock. Tunes that'll have you keeping this disc handy for sometime to come are the opener, the band's staple ""Louie Louie"", the snappy ""What'd I Say"", ""Twist And Shout"", ""Do You Love Me"", the classic ""Mojo Workout"" and their cover of the Beatle's hit ""Money"". Only flaw here is that original Kingsmen vocalist Jack Ely wasn't at these two shows for some reason. Still, the remaining line-up of Mike Mitchell-guitar & vocals, Bob Nordby-bass, Don Galuchi-keyboards and Lynn Easton on drums manage to more than make up for it. Sound quality is between very good to excellent, I thought. Highly recommended."
3,+1/2 - The Kingsmen lay it down live in late 1963,"This stereo recording, excerpted from two live dates late in 1963, is of surprisingly good quality for its era. Kingsmen lead vocalist Jack Ely was not with the band at this point, so sax player Lynn Easton sings most of the leads, but no matter - this is club music for dancing, and the band lays down some mean beats. Much like the group's iconic national anthem of garage rock, ""Louie, Louie,"" this is invitingly sloppy at turns, but the drums and bass will keep you moving, and the guitar and organ carve out passable, if not particularly inventive, jams. This isn't a carefully rehearsed group recording a live album for posterity; it's a rock `n' roll band running through their repertoire for a club crowd. For maximum enjoyment, turn it up, have a drink or two, and dance. 3-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings. [2011 hyperbolium dot com]"
4,Good Music,"AC/DC stormed on the U.S. music scene with Highway to Hell. They toured the country opening for other guitar bands like Kiss. When we found out that AC/DC already had several albums previously released in Australia, well, we were just thrilled. This was one of those albums.All of these songs are excellent songs with catchy rhythm tracks. The lyrics are attractive to the testosterone laden teenage boy: the title track, Big Balls, Rocker, etc... The chorus of Problem Child was one of the anthems of my teenage years.What I like most about this band and this CD is Malcolm. He lays down some cool sounding rhythms that are fun and relatively easy to play. I got the tablature from the internet and worked my way through all of these songs. Friday afternoon I like to put this in my CD player and crank up my Seymour Duncans and play along."
3,More hard rockin',"Lacking the sheer dynamic energy of BACK IN BLACK, DIRTY DEEDS is more typical of AC/DC's output. With a driving beat, the title track is a match fro anything the band has done and ""Big Balls is...well, it's ridiculous and that's exactly why it's so much fun. The other cuts rock, but are relatively forgettable. AC/DC will rarely surprise, but they do put out consistently hard rockin' music."
2,You've Heard WAY Better From This Outfit,"With the exceptions of ""Problem Child"" and that irresistible title cut, you have heard WAY better from AC/DC. ""Squealer"" is a case of an intriguing lyric on sexual mores (at least, on Bon Scott's terms) buried by a kind of marking-timeness in the song structure which permeates the entire album. And, considering it was their second album, actually (""Let There Be Rock"" was their third, though it was only the second to get a U.S. release), that's saying something. Of course, topping a debut as audacious as ""High Voltage"" wasn't exactly a simple trick - but it wouldn't take very long for AC/DC to get back on the right foot..."
3,Grade C-,"Not much new here for AC DC, same old same old rock and roll. Even has PROBLEM CHILD, which was on LET THERE BE ROCK. Is P. CHILD a new or improved recording? or Live? No it's on here to fill space, like they have nothing else to write about.THE GOODPROBLEM CHILD, DIRTY DEEDS, and RIDE ON. All of which are classic tunes from the group.THE BADJust about everthing else. Production is as weak as the song writing. BIG BALLS is a big boring ine listen joke, that may be funny to listen to again if you were drunk or high, which seems to be AC DC's average fan base.C.P.O.V.F**k in a cople of songs. Songs about teenage sex (Squealer), balls in all forms, grouping, and killing your wife, friends, etc..(DIRTY DEEDS)."
2,I made a mistake buying this CD.,"Personally I didn't like this album when I bought it. Something seemed to be missing from it. But I far from concider this a flop. The tunes simply stick to you, especially the title track. (Which was the reason I bought this.) And it is perfect for those with a sick sense of humor. I am more of metalhead listener. And if you fall under that category I don't reccomend this CD. But if you're in the mood for purebred golden rock-and-roll, this CD is incredeble. It all depends on perspective: Plain and simple."
3,Too much compression on the remaster!,"Dirty Deeds, Problem Child and Ride On are all great songs but I would try to purchase the original, uncrushed version of the CD. A lot of the rhythm and feel of the songs was lost as the remastering used way too much compression.It's a great album but the sound isn't quite right. I would look for a different version of the album than this one -- Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap (Dlx) [Original Recording Reissued, Original Recording Remastered]"
5,Bon Scott,I wish Bon Scott had lived. He was so very talented. This alblum is awesome.Personaly I love every alblum with Bon Scott. All those people who don't know. Back in Black would have been Bon Scotts next alblum.Anyway thanks....
5,Classic AC/DC,The first five tracks are simply amazing. My favorite has to be Big Balls because it shows ac/dc having fun and simply being some dab a** rock n rollers. You cannot go wrong with this album if you are into ac/dc or just good music period.
5,Their 3rd album and what a classic!,"It would be nice if this would get a re-issue and include ""love at first feel"" its the only song that wasn't released in Australia. But the new re-issues are released here, but it would still be nice to see the ultimate dirty deeds album contain Love At First Feel with it!"
4,Dirt Cheap Rock,AC/DC is not known for fancy layered music and ballads and numerous effects. They are stripped down rock. They just crank the Marshalls up and let fly with distorted guitar riffs. This album is an excellent example of AC/DC's stripped down style. While not as good as Back In Black it is easily in their top 5 albums.
5,AC/DC Rocks,Thanks to Amazon for making these albums available at a great price. Quickly shipped and high quality!
1,Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap.....IS CHEAP!!,"When i bought this i was looking foward to ""hard rock"" like on BACK IN BLACK,FLY ON THE WALL,or,FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK.This album is crap!When i put it on,i listened to DIRTY DEEDS,and track 2 came on(skip),track 3(skip),track 4(skip),track 5(skip),track 6(skip),track 7(skip),track 8(skip),untilltrack #9(which is ""squealer"")I didn't skip,now(to me),Brian Johnson is way better than Bon(though he's good too).I think that this would've been better with Brian.Dont get this album if you're new to AC/DC,get either BACK IN BLACK,HIGHWAY TO HELL,FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK,FLICK OF THE SWITCH,FLY ON THE WALL,LET THERE BE ROCK,or THE RAZORS EDGE.But if you're a big fan,you'll like it."
4,wow...ok,"if you thought Back in Black was full of entendres, wait until you hear this cd. IT is not their most memorable cd, but it is a little different from their standard format AND it is very funny, which is the reason I got it. If you like AC/DC this will affirm you obsession, if you hate them this won't change your mind. I personally think this cd is amusing and interesting, but it doesn't hold up as well as their classics like Highway to Hell and Back In Black. If you are a new fan you should get those two cds, and if you like those a lot, go for this one. It is a little different and very funny (you are in for a major laff when you get to the song ""big balls.."" trust me, its extremely funny a few times). overall an interesting little classic that shouldn't be overlooked."
5,Doing it right!,"Ac/Dc Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap is definetly their best! The bridge between Ac/Dc's debut and Bon Scotts final album Highway to Hell, You will definetly enjoy this one! With songs like, ""Love at First Feel"", ""Ride On"", and ""Squeeler"" you will be transported to the mid-seventies rock that made you bang your head. For those of you who are experiencing this album for the first time, you will experience the difference between Bon and Brian (Lead Singers)and come to understand how Bon set them(Ac/Dc) at the forefront of the seventies Rock&Roll scene. Get it and enjoy!"
4,Really good,"This is really good. This album has some stuff that isn'tclassicAC/DC but that doesn't make it bad in my view. Youhave Dirty Deeds/Squealer/Problem Child which are all classicAC/DC... But then you have ""Big Balls"" and ""Ride On"" thatwith one you get comedy and the other you get a AC/DC bluessong but it is like no other. This album brought more thanjust pure hard rock. It's alittle more versitile(sp?)albumthan the other stuff they did... Really good. It falls somewhere between the 3rd and 6th best album they did. Most bandswould Love to have a album like this as they're best work."
3,"A good album, but not great.","Let me start by saying that I am a big AC/DC fan, and I really like Dirty Deeds. That said, it is a good album. It is not great. There are flashes of brilliance (Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, Problem Child, Rocker). There are also some mediocre songs. For instance, Big Balls is a funny song, but really not a good song. Squealer is ok at best, and There's Gonna Be SOme Rockin' is forgettable.This album is much more bluesey than their later work (Highway to Hell, Back in Black, etc) and also more lyrically provacative.If you are an AC/DC fan you will like this album. If you are looking for a more representative album of AC/DC pick of Highway to Hell of Back in Black."
3,AC/DC cd,I bought for only a few songs. But it is what i got. Which is good.Cheap n good if this what youre looking for.
4,great cd,This is one of the cd's that i didn't have in my collection yet from AC/DC. The quality of the cd was excellent
4,acdc,"perfectly fine cd. couldn't order the music online anywhere, so I had to buy the cd. now my son has it."
5,AC/DC's got the biggest balls of them all,Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap is probably my favorite AC/DC album next to Highway to Hell but this album is great. I thought that Rocker was weaker than it shoulda been but the other eight are perfect AC/DC song. The album was America's second look at the band and Australia's thrid album by them. The songs on this truly define what this hardcore band is all about. Dirty Deeds is pure Rock N Roll and really what Rock should be. Problem Child is my favorite song on this album but I've listened to every song on this album numerous times. If you really want a laugh listen to Big Balls. It is such a funny song you'll wonder how they came up with it. This album is a must have and anyone who likes AC/DC should go out and buy it.
2,Not great but not horrible either.,"Buy this only for Dirty Deeds, Problem Child and Aint No Fun. There's Gonna be Some Rockin' might be the worst song AC/DC has ever made."
3,A fun CD for all,I spent a good part of the autumn of '86 getting well acquainted with this CD & it has been a part of my collection since then. it is not AC/DC's best but it is pure fun. if you like to rock & bop to cranking music this CD is for you.
3,Grade C-,"AC/DC DIRTY DEEDS is not as strong as HIGHWAY or LET THERE BE ROCK, but it is still heads above all the other cds from the Bon Scott era. While the title track is clearly the catchiest song on the cd, rest of the cd seems labored, as if they are trying too hard. It isn't untill they slow it down on RIDE ON that they really shine. PROBLEM CHILD is a LET THERE BE ROCK song, that is throw in too make a better cd. SQUEALER is a rocker, but never gets any where. BIG BALLS is a big joke. AC/DC is just on a plain dirty one track mind."
5,One of their best,"I love this album, it's one of my favorites. I can listen to this album all the way through. It keeps you rockin' because it's really hard, and a few songs like Dirty Deeds and Rocker are almost metal. Some major highlights are Dirty Deeds, Problem Child, Rocker...Hell, the whole CD is good. If you are an AC/DC fan, this is a must have. If you like classic rock or hard rock, this is also a must have. This CD rocks!"
4,Great album,"This album was globaly released in 1977..save the USA..where it was released in 1981..and i must say, this is one good album. every track on here has its own mood to it..from 'dirty deeds done dirt cheap' which is up in your face and really shows that using three chords is cool..while ""ride on"" is ac/dc's probably ownly truely ""slow"" song..still very good song. I recommend this album to any AC/DC fan.however, dont' judge ac/dc by this album..cuz 'highway to hell' and 'back in black' are better albums..but this is about average for them."
4,Love At First Listen,"When i first bought this cd I wasn't sure it was the right choice since it was my first acdc cd that I bought so I didnt know which one would be the best..so I just picked the oldest one on the shelf (usually the oldest ones are the best). When I played this cd and heard ""dirty deads done dirt cheap"" it won me over and I played the whole album all the way through many times. ""Big Balls"" is the only song on the cd that could have been left out, but besides that it has some great tracks on the cd and some of the best on any of acdc's albums. If you all ready have some or picking out your first acdc cd get dirty deads done dirt cheap its great."
4,a great album for 15 year olds,"This album was recorded in 1976 but not released in the U.S. until 1981 after AC/DC had become huge. Again, AC/DC take the simplest of concepts and somehow make it rock. AC/DC take a big, simple, catchy guitar riff and a big, simple, catchy hook and just shove them in your face until you're singing, or air guitaring, or fist banging along with them. Best example here is the awesome title track, which also features some of their best dirty-living lyrics. Another standout is the dumb joke tune, ""Big Balls"", which I thought was pretty hilarious when I was 13. This album also features AC/DC's one and only ballad in a 25-year career, the uncharacteristically serious blues, ""Ride On""."
5,Dirty Deads Done Dirt Cheap B*tch,"One of AC/DC best that any rock group has to offer. Other groups have either sweet guitar rifts, or good vocals this one has it all. Buy this album and become a real ROCKER!!"
4,"Terrible shipping, item as expected though","The item was as expected but some arrived with broken off, cracked lids and lotion all over the inside of the box. Apparently free shipping means Amazon throws your items in a box with no extra packaging to protect it."
1,Stay AWAY from Canus - if you care about your body,I will no longer use Canus after reading the ingredients. Pretty scary. I now use all natural and nearly natural products that I purchase from WendyLou's Natural Bath. So glad a friend recommended her products to me and my family. All vegetable based handmade bath and body products. Her goats milk lotion and jojoba lotion are heavenly and I love her soaps and milk baths too. Definitely recommend her products.
5,Nice and Beautiful,"Not her best but of course not hers it is a soundtrack.She is the best singer in the world today and combined with her beauty,grace and power she is the Muhammad Ali of singers! Did I hear someone say the best ever?"
4,Fine Guide,"This guide to the Alabama Hills is a climbing guide as good as can be.First, it includes a lot of routes in the area. Second, the drawings indicating route locations are clear and abundant, and the route beta is accurate (e.g. number of bolts). There was just one route we could not find in our first weekend at the A. Hills (Magic Pig, Cattle Pocket). Third, the guide not only rates the difficulty of the routes (i.e. 5.xx), it also rates the quality of the rock, using a 3-star rating system. Last but not least, like many CA climbing guides, the guide provides some history of the development of the area.Concluding, this guide provided an excellent means to enjoy one of the few bolted climbing areas in Southern California."
3,"""USB Compatible for most computers""?","The design of this unit is less than perfect; the mini B usb port connecting to the unit complicates things considerably if it doesn't self-power up to your laptop (as was the case with my Sony VAIO). There is no Y adaptor available with a female end and two male ends to splice onto the mini USB/USB cable used with the unit. You're pretty much forced to go with the AC adaptor (did I say less than perfect?), a 5 volt unit that isn't a handy-dandy component at your local electronics store, and which costs $30+ dollars (from SmartDisk). A USB enclosure (as opposed to the mini-USB) would make better sense; this one is an ""odd-ball"" to be sure."
1,"Houston, we have a problem.","I have had this firelite for about 6 months and one day it just wouldn't mount on the desktop. I use this on a regular basis - back and forth to work in a Mac based platform. It would light up when plugged in, but would not mount. I've searched google for answers - try it... you'll see I and many others have the same issue. Suggestions have been to change the USB cable to one with 2 ends because it uses too much power. It's a tragedy when you loose valuable work to to cheap technology. I would not recommend this to anyone - well maybe an enemy."
4,Nice simple flat,"This is a nice, simple flat. Sturdy and worth the low price. I have purchased other Me Too products, and have always been happy with the quality."
4,Great shoe,"I love these shoes! In fact, I saw them at Nordstrom's the other days and they were over $60. I got them for under $30 on Amazon, but coupons - what a deal!!"
5,Our Favorite Book,"I originally found this in my local library 18 months ago. When we returned it after two weeks, my 2 year old kept asking me to read it again, so I bought a copy. We continue to read it often. It's a delightful story about Shabbat and family, and why it's all so special to a little boy. In addition to being a wonderful story, the illustrations are beautiful, and the typography is far better than most children's books. It looks like this book was an act of love for everyone who contributed to it."
3,A needed work in an important field,"In many engineering applications, the usefulness of metal alloys has been maximized, and the search is on for alternate materials. A growing option is ceramics. This growing use of ceramic materials requires a growing knowledge of their behavior under many conditions. One of this is corrosion. The knowledge of the corrosion and oxidation of ceramics is especially important given the fact that ceramics are often used where metal alloys cannot be used: high temperature applications where all sorts of chemical activation barriers are surpassed. This book, though old, provides a useful introduction to the corrosion of commonly used ceramics such as alumina, silica, silicon carbide, silicon nitride, boron nitride, and aluminum nitride."
5,Another great Wilton pan,"Perfect for my son's CARS birthday party. I bought the CARS icing, too- the colors are more vibrant than the regular Wilton colors."
2,Poor detail on cake,"I've been making my little cousins birthday cakes with these Wilton shaped pans since they were born (and even before that if we want to count baby shower cakes). I have never had any problems following the pattern and my cakes were always greeted with amazement (even when I insist that I just follow an outline). My cousin's 4th birthday rolled around and she requested a ""Cars"" cake so I ordered the pan. I used a basic chocolate cake mix and while the cake slipped easily out of the pan the detailing on the pan was barely visible on the cake itself. Pressed for time I decided I didn't have time to basically freehand the design and had to scrap my plans and get a grocery store ""Cars"" cake. This pan ruined my streak of making all their cakes! =["
3,It did the job!,"The pan worked out well. It requires one box cake mix. My issues with the pan are first, it was extremely difficult to grease and flour the pan. Second, after it bakes it was hard to see where some of the details where, such as the lightning bolt above the tire, the headlights, the lightning bolt with the number 95, and the number 95 itself. Third, for some reason they placed the purchase logo right over the most complicated area of the design. There is a smaller photo inside so you can still see, but it was a bit frustrating. The cake turned out great none the less. I realized after purchasing this pan there would be no place to write Happy Birthday for my son. I also thought the pan looked small, so I baked a larger square cake base to set this one on. It created a neat 3-D effect, and I was able to write Happy Birthday and create a neat Radiator Springs backdrop. Happy Baking!"
5,LOVE IT!,This whole series by Evans is fantastic! I wish the author woulg write more! If anybody knows the authors alter ego let me know!!! I cant tell you how much I loved this book and the whole series!
4,bre,"this pc is very good.i goes over to my friend house everyday to get on her pc.she has one like this.we can check email,look up our projects very fast.if i had an computer i would want one this like this one to.it is easy to learn how to use .she have not had no trouble with it.it is easy to upgrade to.it has a lot of memory.i would love to have one.i would tell people if you are looking for a computer buy one like this you would enjoy it.you would also go back and buy other products to."
5,Fantastic Board Book!,"My eight-month old son smiles and laughs the second anyone starts saying, ""It's turkey time, Thanksgiving Day...."". Cute pictures, with the added bonus of being so easy to memorize you can recite at will (or in a dark bedroom at night)."
2,The image on the cover is great but,My husband loves Rumi's poetry but both of us were very disappointed with most of the pictures. He is keeping it but only because he needed a month wall calendar.
5,Love the Rumi Calendars,"I get the Illuminated Rumi Calendar every year. Hardest part.....throwing them away when the year is done!! Great inspiration and beautiful pictures. Except for Oct. 2013....the guy's a little scarey, so I covered him up with a beautiful rainbow! This was the ONLY time I've ever done that.I would recommend this calendar to anyone who appreciate Rumi's writtings."
5,"Beautiful, enchanting book","An inspiring, meditative read and doubles as a thought provoking picture book. You can read it lightly or with heavy thought. Your choice."
5,"lucious illustration, inspiring poetry","I purchased this item as a gift, and will buy another for myself. The art is stunning, the translations bring poetry to life. A book to treasure for years."
4,Illuminated Rumi,"I find some of the other rather pedantic reviews a bit troubling. I can, of course, appreciate that those who are more knowledgable about Sufism in general, and Rumi in specific, might be disappointed in what some obviously consider a lack of credentials on Mr. Barks part; however, as a relative newcomer to Sufism and the works of Rumi, I must say that this is an excellent place to start. No, perhaps the translation is not exact, but the combination of the magnificent illuminations, and the undeniable strengh and power of Rumi's poetry will move many newcomers like myself to do further, more in depth research and hopefully capture the true essence of the message. And isn't that the point? Start the neophytes slowly, so as not to overwhelm them; intrigue them, in order to guide them. Why else would I be here?"
1,A book to celebrate Coleman Barks,"This book will disappoint anyone who has seriously delved into the writings of Rumi. It is hard to see where Rumi starts and Barks leaves off which left me totally confused. I believe that Barks took many liberties with the translation of Rumi writings. The art work was too ""new-age"" for me and did not really add any new insights into the life and writings of this man.A very shallow read."
1,Very disappointing,"This book obscures the bold spirit of Rumi with a facade of emotionally dominated wishful thinking. Rumi should challenge, confront, transport and dare the reader - but this book merely panders. The text is liberally sprinkled with irrelevancies and contains several interpolations, mistranslations and historical inaccuracies, indeed, blatant balderdash in a couple of places. The poetry is generally well rendered but is a pre-digested selection of the ""soft bits"" - the bones have been filleted out. One also gets the vague impression that the English language has been ""dumbed down"". The illustrations are well executed, except for the snapshot at the end, which is both irrelevant and uninteresting. This piece of self-indulgent drivel spoils an otherwise good collection of artwork. In summary, the reader will end up knowing more about Coleman Barks than about Rumi."
3,"Rumi of course I love, but this book as a whole . . .","Pro:Rumi is 5 stars and beyond. Beautiful translations and interesting selection of his work. I do enjoy sitting down with this book mainly for the poetry itself, though I love the merging of art and poetry.Con:The graphic art style feels outdated. Also, the art sometimes makes it hard to follow the flow of the poem; sometimes the visual gets in the way of the poem instead of contributing.Overall:I am still crossing my fingers to find an art and Rumi collection that works timelessly together. This is definitely not that collection."
5,One of my top 10,"Green and Barks have created a wonderful book to interest anyone who is spiritually minded. Not sure if Rumi was translated perfectly or even in accordance with Sufism--there probably was a lot lost in translation as is always the case. However, the poems appeal to one who is interested in universal truth and the book moves you to think about the Infinite--and that may be the ultimate purpose of any spiritual work. This book adds beauty in artistry (right brain) and then asks the deep and pointed questions that get you thinking (left brain).I've given away over 15 copies and everyone has enjoyed this book.The Illuminated Rumi is in my all time TOP 10 favorites and I take it off the shelf often...and I must have over 20 books on Sufism that never even get opened."
2,Office Access 2003 Review,"I personally did not like this book. I am pretty new to Access but I am young so I pick these programs up pretty fast. My work involved some advanced query work for data scrubbing. The book goes over every single function but does not go into depth about it. When it described a object (IE: list boxes), i really needed to know how Access stores the data and how i can access it, but the book was no help. I got a feel for the program's functions but could not use this book as a reference when i was coding. I wanted to use this book like i used Excel 2003 Bible, with the detail that I could refer too. Maybe I was looking for too much?"
2,You Gotta Be Kidding,All the songs sound the same. I couldn't tell which song I was listening to. Anybody can do that! BORING!!!
1,THIS SETTLES IT!,"This CD just proves that ANYONE can rap! I mean, a Nickelodean talk show host? Oh well. It has to be somewhat creative. It does have a song called ""Get Crunk Shorty""."
3,He's no Will Smith but it will do,"Nick Cannon's debut was pretty good. I loved his songs with B2K, R.Kelly, and Mary J. I guess he maybe another to not cuss to sell records. But it was worth the wait."
1,Nick Cannon...synonymous for WEAK!!!,"What can I say about this?? I only needed to hear two songs to know that this cd would NEVER find it's way into my collection. ""Ya Pops"" and that ""Gigolo"" song are equally awful. Nick Cannon is the corniest actor/wannabe rapper that I have seen in a while.The only thing worse than his music are those globs of saliva that are always in the corners of his mouth.Save your $$$."
3,it's pretty good,"I can't believe all of the bad reviews i'm reading about this cd. I'm 35yrs old and not really a big fan of rap but i just saw it in the store and listened to it and i really liked alot of the songs. GET CRUNK SHORTY, I OWE YOU,FEELIN FREAKY, GIGILO are some of my favorites I don't particualy like MY RIB or the one with Nevea but overall the cd has good catchy beats. I guess a lot of kids don't like it because he's not a thug rapper and not doing any cussing. In the minds of the youth of today that constitutes a bad rapper.Back in the day rap had alot of corny lyrics but good beats and they knew how to do it without cussing and degradeing women (...).keep it clean Nick...don't try to be like everyone else to fit it Do what you believe in."
3,"Good pop, not rap","Not so bad actually, many songs are fun and radio friendly, not that he's a super rapper but his lyrics are sometimes funny. Ok, Nick has got alot of help cause he's on tv + that many ""good"" artists appear on his album. Rap fans wouldn't buy this perhaps but it's a decent pop album. ""Feeling freaky"" with B2k ""Gigolo"" with R. Kelly "" Whenever you need me with Mary "" I used to be in love"" with Joe also Nivea and Biz Markie appaearing on 2 songs. Skip the first one with the super annoying Ying Yang twins and Fatman Scoop. But it's a good album, both slow and faster tracks, good guest artists that get's your attention, nice pop music. If People can buy pop-rap like Nelly why not Nick Cannon too?"
3,its ok,"the cd is ok but only songs i like is getting crunk, feeling freaky w/ b2k and gigolo. the others is not all that good. nick stick to acting. but you was good in drumline."
3,Not too bad,"First of all...Nick Cannon is NOT dissin B2K on Gigolo...He cleared that up in an interview.I think this album was ok. I wouldn't call it horrible. It seems to me like this is stuff that he had been working on for a while, and put on the album just to get it released. I am looking forward to a second album, with hopes that it is worth 5 stars."
1,Nick Cannon Gets his bubble popped,My god this guy cannot rap IZ U SERIOUS IVE BEEN WIT DOWN WIT DEZ STANKIN H***S ALL MY LIFE IVE BEEN DOIN EM ALL NITE IN DA CLUBZ YO I BEEN A POPPIN DAT TING ALL NITE LONG that is what rap is today people there are some mainstream exceptionsLyrics 1/10 Production 2/10 X Factor 1/10 Classic 1/10 Me -1/10Overall-5/50 This album gets a great 10% You are an idiot.
1,Thats too bad,"I just heard ""Whenever you need me"", that beat was done by some biter, i can't believe that's even legal cause thats the same exact beat that was on Camp Lo's first CD ""Uptown Saturday Night"" produced by Ski. For those of you who liked this CD, i don't expect you to care. For those of you who didn't like this CD check ""Uptown Saturday Night"" and let Camp Lo show you that that beat can be rapped to. I apologize for not having heard this entire CD before reviewing it but im convinced i didn't miss much."
2,Somebody should stick to act.,Somebody should stick to act. he good a acter. Really Bad rapper. Its gets 2 out of 5
3,The world does not need another Will Smith rapper,"Nick Cannon should just stick to acting cause his rapping is just like the old school rap from back in the day nobody cares for that kind of rap anymore. This cd doesn't even have any profanity so you know it's a joke. Nick Cannon isn't hardcore off the streets, he probably came from a rich family."
5,nick cannon is sexy,"NICK CANNON IS SO SEXY......I LOVE HIS SONGS,HE LOOK GOOD IN THAT MOVIE DRUMLINE....I WAS LIKE DAMN HOMIE!!! I ALSO LOVE B2K.....AND STOP SAYING NICK DISSED B2K......THAT'S JUST RUMORS DON'T BELIEVE THAT CRAP CUZ I LOVE NICK AND B2K AND MARQUES HOUSTON.....THEY ARE ALL TALENTED BLACK YOUNG MEN....HOLLA"
3,ITS COO,"I WAS COO. THE CD DID GET OLD TO ME. I REALY DONT CHOOSE TO LISTEN TO IT ANYMORE. NICK IS STILL ONE OF MY FAVORITES. THE SONGS WERE NOT TOO BAD, LIKE THEY CLAM.MOST OF THE REVIEWERS ARE NOT FANS OF HIM LIKE I AM. BUT HE IS A BETTER ACTOR.i think he is trying to do too much so he can win a award or somethin? who knows"
4,PHD,Listen up you phd ******* just because you guys cant get a girlfriend or be popular doesn't mean you have to take it out on people you don't even know. This cd is good if it wasn't why is it selling so good. All you guys should start acting like people instead of roaches.
4,This album's gotton a lot of bad rap over the years,"No, this is not Heart's best album, by far. However can an album with Ann Wilson singing on it be considered 'bad'? First track is the best song on the album, 'City's Burning' rocks, and I can't believe they never kept it in their live show, it just sounds like a song that should be played loud, live, and to open a show.Yes the album has some clunkers 'America' I could do without. 'The Situation' I just didn't get either. 'This Man is Mine' sounds silly, but what guy wouldn't want Ann or Nancy to feel that way about them? (I'll take Ann if I had the choice). The title track is OK leaves me lukewarm at best. Heart fans will like this album for the most part. People who are only interested in Heart's 'hits' can do without this one."
1,This is Hearts worst collection of songs. buy the Road Home,"Thank god I bought this at the used tape store. This album was such a disapointment. I love Heart, but stay away from this one. P.U. it stinks."
3,good,the 3 first tracks are very good.only then.city is burning is the heavyest track of heart.the other tracks seens that the band is not working togheter
3,You have to give it a chance,"I bought this CD and really didn't care for it at first, but after giving it some time it grew on me. True it is not their best, but it's not too bad. No Heart collection is complete without it."
3,Not bad,"I listened to this cd once and didn't listen past the second song. However, a few months later I played it and thought ""not bad"". Definitely not one of Heart's best but worth a listen. Ann's vocals certainly sound great on this cd and I would recommend that you buy for this reason."
5,My favorite Heart Album,"While this album was not commercially a success, this is my favorite Heart album by far. It is such a departure from everything before. Bright Light Girl is an infectious pop song that could've easily been a hit. Perfect Stranger is a great ballad that really showcases Anne's great vocals. And Private Audition is a quirky wonderful song. This album was impossible to get on CD for years so I was excited to see it rereleased. This may not be the favorite album of Heart purists, but I appreciate when artists go outside the box and try something different. This truly was the case with Private Audition. An underrated album."
2,Maybe OK for a smaller shelf,"Carefully measured the shelf to be used prior to purchase. It was within all the listed criteria for dimensions and weight as shown on this Amazon listing, though admittedly at the upper end for size (9.75"" and 14/16ths thick). Weight is only 4 lbs. Though secure to the wall, it's a sagging mess. The bottom bracket can't securely tighten down at 14/16ths. They need to indicate a thinner maximum thickness. Am returning."
5,Good quality product.,"These brackets were a perfect addition to my bathroom. They are strong, but have a much nice look and style than others that I have used. They are perfect for me!"
2,"For very small, light-weight shelves",The shelf we wanted to use these brackets for was too big and fell out. I had to order a different brand of brackets to get them sturdy enough to hold the shelf.
1,Where's Tammy? Where are the clever lines?,"I absolutely love this movie... and I loved the music in it, but they left the best stuff out. I love Olivia's songs, but there is no Tammy Wynette at all. And the quoted lines are good, but not the best. The sometimes tend toward the melancholy and the unmemorable... it's like they waited for the line after the big laugh line and included it. Buy the DVD when it comes out and Tammy Wynette's greatest hits and you'll be much more pleased."
2,"A Must Have, But Not a Must Listen","As an Olivia fan, I had to add this soundtrack to my collection. But after listening to it once, I have no desire to hear it again, and it's been shelved. Nevertheless, I'm glad I have it for the few Olivia tracks that are featured."
2,sordid lives,"The music and lyric components of ""Sordid Lives"" is lively and entertaining. However, the inclusion of dialogue from the DVD is annoying and dissonant. The product labeling is not clear that this product is part of the actual soundtrack for the film (or series). The play goes from musical and fun to mumbled spoken lines by the cast- which if you have not seen the production, are confusing and interruptive to listening. I contacted the seller to see if he had sent me the wrong product. He responded that he did not know about dialogue/music, because the AMAZON LABEL did not include the info about the dialogue as part of the product description. IF I had known that, I would not have purchased the CD."
3,WIsh it was better .. .. ..,"A bit of a disappointment: seems like a fan just threw it together from a copy of the movie. Where are the full songs? The idea of interspersing dialog, I love, however like other reviewers stated, there are a hundred great lines in the movie - all that could have replaced the dialog chosen for the CD. Love the hymns, and some of the songs written for the CD, however not a CD I will listen to a lot."
2,Olivia's fans dissapointment,"If you are a true Olivia Newton John fan, stay away from this CD. In comparison with most of her recordings, Olivia's songs in this album are pretty disappointing. Her participation is not what I would have expected. With the exception of two, the rest of her songs were not recorded in a studio; they were taken from the movie scenes. They are really brief, they have no music arrangements and the sound quality is awful. It is a pity that other artists had been treated better in this CD. Olivia songs sound terrible in comparison. Spare yourself the heartache of listening to Olivia's wonderful voice completely wasted."
1,Get Away Now!,"Get away from this soundtrack now unless you are an absolute die-hard Olivia Newton-John fan. It is horrible. When you are used to Olivia's innocence and pure voice, it is just pure nerve wracking to listen to this. When she came out with it's a b**** sortin' out our sordid lives, and you'll probably get a really s***ty prize, that is just when I had to turn it off. This will definatly turn you against Olivia Newton-John unless you are a lover of her to the very end, nomatter what."
1,Out of Date...,"I purchased this item but could not even load it. I had no idea that it was for Win95...I have Win 7. Why do these people even sell these. People need to look real hard before buying software that is ancient. It may have worked when new though, so I cannot rate it on how it should work."
2,"Oh no, not again!!!","This soundtrack is just the latest victim of a horrible concept: mixing dialogue from a movie with its soundtrack. If the dialogue cuts were separate from the tracks, maybe I could handle it by skipping the talk, but this one overlays the dialogue onto the tracks, much as they are timed in the movie. I am sick and tired of this trend. Plenty of soundtracks have been ruined for me in this manner, from Pulp Fiction to Desperado. Confound it, if I want to hear dialogue, I will buy the... movie and watch the appropriate sections. Cut this ... out!!! I buy a soundtrack for the MUSIC, not so I can ""relive the magic of the film"", or some such garbage. Sexy Beast is a great movie and contains a fantastic compilation of tunes, both techno and lounge, and I had hoped to have them all on what promised to be a great CD. I can pass on this absurdity."
5,Definitely! A True British Thriller! True Indie Greatness!!! Hilarious too!,"I love this movie and the music! It is all awesome. What makes the music so great are the bands and songwriters. You get to hear music from Henry Mancini, South, U.N.K.L.E, Roque Banos Dean Martin and others. You have to love and appreciate the BritFilm quality and very diverse music score that outlines Sexy Beast as one of the best indie flicks of the UK in all accounts! Cheers Dirk-David"
1,Corny Movie,Enough said. I fell asleep on this one. It was confusing and the plot was corny. Don't waste your money.
3,"Generous, but goes south quickly","I've recently taken a big dive into the reggae waters... buying various discs trying to discover the incredible talent found down in Jamaica. These Hip-O ""Ultimate Collection"" discs are packed with songs and seem a good way to sample some respected bands. This is my first Third World CD and I have to say that if I investigate further it will be with their early albums. This collection takes a bigtime dive into cheesy, 80's sounding reggae about halfway through. Compare this to the Black Uhuru or Dillinger Hip-O comps and it's a bit disappointing. I LOVE roots reggae and older authentic sounds like Toots and the Maytals. This CD just seems to take a path away from strong reggae sounds that I enjoy. Not bad, but not perfect."
2,Pretty disappointing,"I've been delving deep into roots reggae for about 8 years, but finally got around to checking out Third World just now. As my introduction to them, this compilation is not very good. Or maybe I just don't like the group's sound as much as all the other roots I've fallen in love with. Third World seems to lack a distinctive vocal sound. I found their harmonizing to be boring. The song that they're perhaps most known for, ""96 Degrees in the Shade"" is pretty mediocre in my opinion. Their version of Bunny Wailer's ""Dream Land"" is pretty weak. Maybe I need to check out their earliest albums, since the few songs on here I did think were decent were from their early days."
5,Accurate history holds interest,I enjoyed this book. I recommomend this book to other readers who are interested in the history of the world war II. This book is intersesing and I loved reading it.
3,Amazing photographs,"Make no mistake: this guy was a devil in disguise, and he needed to be, in order to survive in the brutal Eastern Front in World War II.The ferocity, determination, audacity, skill and dareness he applied in his attacks against the Russians, since the start of the war, must mean that he supported (or was brain-washed, like so many) Nazi doutrination to the core, knowing or not knowing about the atrocities.Even if the text was bad (which is not, although completely avoiding post-war controversies), it would be worth jsut for the photso, which are amazing."
3,"Historically accurate on the war, yet lacking in other areas","Hans-Ulrich Rudel was the ultimate aerial warrior, regardless of nationality. As the most decorated warrior to emerge from any nation during the war, his combat career was unparalelled and will never be equalled. However, stating these facts, the book should have gone into greater detail regarding Rudel's post war involvement with the ODESSA and his anti-Semitic views and activities following the war. Taking nothing away from his stellar record in Stukas, the book is lacking in specific detail that would have made it a more accurate biography."
5,hans rudel stuka pilot,"For anyone interested in military aviation this history is a must. Indeed, the book is an enthralling story for anyone about one of the most accomplished military pilots in history. Rudel was a natural warrior who fought encased in a Ju87 rather than in armour with a sword. He epitomised everything expected of a National Socialist fighter. All of his actions occurred on the Eastern Front against the Soviets. With over 2,500 sorties in total and over 500 Soviet tanks, a battleship and six enemy aircraft to his credit he is unmatched anywhere. Towards the war's end he lost a leg in combat but returned to the air with a prosthetic limb as soon as he could such was his courage and dedication. The book is well written and translated and the description of Rudel's experiences are vivid and memorable. This book can appeal even to those who are not necessarily WWII aficionados."
4,Bing Crosby Have Yourself a Merry Christmas,"I was looking for a particular song and finally found it on this album at Amazon. Great! The price was very good, too."
4,Very good for small group studies!,"My chapter of the Daughters of the King did this as a 6-month study (we meet once a month and did a chapter each month). A different person led each lesson.We found it to be very easy and very rewarding. It is not very time-consuming, but it really does get you thinking about God's will for your life, and it generates some great discussion among the group.Some of the Just for Fun activities are kindof cheesy, like playing hide and seek and dancing around the room. But we skipped the ones we weren't comfortable with.Other sections, such as Quiet Reflection, Knowing God's Heart, and Making It Real in Your Own Life, were awesome. Great tools to make the material sink in!"
3,a very difficult game,"For the experienced or non-experienced battletoad gamer, most will find this version of battletoads to be quite challenging. This game is interesting non the less and will keep some players coming back for more even after continuous ""game-overs"".The graphics are nicely done and the control quality is not great but decent. I only give Battletoads 3 out of 5 stars due to the frustration of trying to conquer the game. If you are someone who hates challenging games, you will most likely do one of three things to battletoads: #1- sell this game after failed attempts to conquer it, #2- slam it against the wall in anger, or #3- throw it in the trash and pity yourself for wasting money on it. As for me, this is one battletoad game that I have to use with the game genie in order to beat it."
5,Brings back so much memories,This game is hard but I never really threw my controller on the floor from it. The game is so much fun to play with a friend and the music is awesome its really catchy. Even though this game is kinda short it is worth the money and I totally recommend it.
5,A real motor-racing classic! Fantastic!!,"This book will make you feel a shiver up your spine! It's all there: the racings, Villeneuve's determination, the real facts, his family, all put together in a reasonable way that makes you read the book non-stopping. There's no need for another Villeneuve reference book, you must be sure!!!"
5,GREAT PEN!,"I love pens, always have, and this is one of my favorites. The weight is ideal, the selectip refills smooth as silk, and it just feels great in my hand when writing with it. I would recommend this to anyone seeking a fine pen for themselves or a special gift."
5,blower motor,"I bought this blower motor based on price. It was much less than the local automotive supply stores and much, much less than the dealer. I was a little hesitant because of the price differential that this would be a decent product. However, I took a chance and have been quite satisfied. The motor was an exact fit for the motor I replaced and works well. It was nice and a time saver that it had the ""squirrel cage"" fan attached so I didn't have to take the old one off my bad motor and attach it to the new one. Of course, I can't give an opinion on the long term product dependability, but so far, so good. I followed the information I gleaned from ""Maxima.org"" as a guide to how to remove and install this motor and had no problems."
5,The Heavenly Voices Series is Amazing,"I first heard Heavenly Voices at a friend's house and in an instant, I was enamored with its content. Never before had I listened to a compilation album and liked the vast majority of the tracks. Usually, you have to buy a CD with mostly unwanted tracks and you have to accept the fact that there is no other way of obtaining the songs you do want. Hyperion did an excellent job with the entire series (yes there are a total of 4 separate albums entitled Heavely Voices, starting with Volume 1 and continuing on) and I hope to see more volumes soon. These albums are the epitome of ""Ethereal"" music."
3,Africando's Latest,"At first many of the melodic hooks seemed all too familiar and similar to previous releases and the lead vocals on most of the tracks lack the feel of the Baloba or Mandali albums. But then I got around to listening more carefully and 3 tracks stand out above all: 'Bogne Sirala' & 'Malawoo' bring in a new flavor for Africando with piano-led melodies going in different directions and the coros widen the range even further. 'Mario' is still signature Africando, classic mid tempo, melodic lead vocals and sharp horn sections."
3,Feels lacking in inspiration,"I agree with Marks Time review completely. Lacking are the great solo moments from the top cream of salsa musicianship as Mandali. Maybe if I could understand the lyrics I would get into it better. But that was the thing about previous Mandali, without understanding Mandali, Sey, or any of the other tracks I was astounded by their musicians and the vocalists tones matching so seamlessly. It was incredible to hear an African singer be elevated by musicians that most likely did not understand him. That very difficult task however was not repeated here.If you must have all Africando CDs, then get it. Otherwise, complete your Ricardo Lemvo collection for that Afro-Latin sound."
3,Okay,Was not as sour or chewy as I expected. Great price for 5 pounds and this will last for a long time but quality was not as I expected.
1,yuck,"this stuff is nasty, waste of money. it has a weird geewy taste to it and just plain nasty. dont buy it"
5,Fantastic disk.,"I had ignored Chicken Shack as there were other much better known power bands at the time. But this album has turned me into a big time Chicken Shack fan. I have subsequently bought a number of other Chicken Shack albums but none compare to this one. There are some of the most remarkable drums and bass performances that I have ever heard. The first track ""Crying won't help you know"" is an astonishing piece of music. The bass, drums and Stan Webb's wah-wah guitar are some of the finest performances that I have ever heard. This is at a level equivalent to Cream at their peak. The second track, Daughter of the Hillside has some of the most rocking sounds ever from that time. Every track is a gem. Poor Boy is a classic. The drum solo on Telling Your Fortune is also a masterpiece. The whole album is certainly up there as one of my top ten albums from the late ""60s and 70s"". You have to get this one!"
4,One of Englands true treasures Stan Webb,"This material formed the mainstay of their live act at this time. Stan was and is one of the finest guitarists to ever come from the UK. His fluid style that always has feeling as well as dexterity and his very English gritty vocals give all his work great feelings, if you havnt heard Stan then get ""Stan the Man Live CD"" Its a cracker. This was a favourite of mine with Poor Boy becomming an Anthem for Stan and Daughter of the Hillside and Going Down rock classics. Thanks for some great nights Stan your a gem."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CHINESE JUNK,"FROM A LOYAL CUSTOMER FOR OVER 25 YEARSFOR A EXPENSIVE, PEN THIS IS NOT WORTH $10.00. THE QUALITY IS SO BAD YOU WOULD THINK MR. WHALEN (C.E.O.) AT A.T. CROSS IN LINCOLN, RI, HAD THE CHINESE SHUT THEIR EYES WHEN PENS CAME THROUGH QUALITY CONTROL. THE GOLD PLATING IS SO BAD IT WOULD NOT EVEN PASS FOR A GOOD KNOCK OFF. THEIR WEBSITE SAID IT'S MANUFACTURED THE SAME WAY FOR THE PAST 158 YEARS ONE AT A TIME BY HAND, SAME QUAILITY?(SEE THEIR WEBSITE). SOMEONE IS REALLY LAUGHING IN LINCOLN - ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK!THE ONLY THING THAT'S GOOD AT CROSS IS THEIR STOCK (ATX) AMEX. BECAUSE FOOLS, LIKE MYSELF BELEIVE THEIR RUBBISH.I WANTED TO BUY A GOOD QUAILITY WRITING INSTRUMENT MADE IN THE U.S.A - I GOT A SURPRISE!DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME, A GOOD QUAILTY FOUNTAIN PEN CAN BE PURCHASED FROM JAPAN AND FRANCE AND IT WON'T SAY CHINA ALL OVER IT."
2,Disappointing,"The story idea is OK, but the characters' continuous denials of the obvious and not saying what they mean gets old quick.For excellent Shelly Thacker reads try _His Forbidden Touch_ and _Timeless_."
3,Good but not a complete guide,"This is a lovely book, but it is not a substitute for a good field guide. It isn't meant to be carried around. It lacks a key to help identify mushrooms. It include separate chapters on edible and poisonous mushrooms . . . which means a lot of paging through to attempt an identification.Also, the book is from the UK, and the recipe section at the end has a UK slant. It also lists a few ingredients under the name used in England: aubergines, etc."
5,it's beautiful,"this is an honest, beautiful album...the production is great, the voices are better....basically, if I'd lost it, i wouldn't trip too much cause I KNOW I'd be okay with buying it again. It's lovely."
5,This is what Soul is about,This where soul/R&B should be. Some real singin with some real playin. Check this out. We need more of this in the genre. These cats should make it big. If you got a mature ear this should stick in it.
4,Great traveling cd,I heard one song on the radio and thought it was very nice. Later I decided to purchase the cd and was pleasantly surprised. My favorite tracks are:#2 Surrender To Love#4 Far Away#7 Stars#14 If I
5,FINALLY...............,"I can say that this album is one where you can sense the ""LOVE"" and admiration that they for one another in each song...To me this is more than an R&B album, this is a blueprint for how ""LOVE"" should be shared between two people and the constant trials and tribulations that go along with something as powerful as ""LOVE"".The song ""STARS"" is definately a great song, and ""FAR AWAY"" is one that we all can relate to, just packing up and going somewhere to escape life for a minute.....Overall I feel that if you are a fan/lover of good music then this is the album for you. Throughout time we've seen many singers/groups come and go, but I think finally we've found one that will be around as long as ""LOVE"" still exist.....Thank-you KINDRED for this album"
5,KINDRED ~ WELL WORTH THE WAIT!,"Being a fan of Kindred since the very first single, I had highly anticipated the release of the album. I thought that the album would be good, but it's SLAMMING!!! Listening to this album was refreshing. The husband and wife duo have taken soul to another level. Balads like Far Away, Weather the Storm, and Stars were a few of my favorites. The sound of Kindred is to the liking of a modern day Ashford & Simpson. You will not be sorry that you bought this album."
5,It's About Time,"Good music - It is about time! This cd is not brash or [dirty]. It is loving, fun, sweet and romantic. This cd is feel music, and I love it! If you want something in your music collection that is love as opposed to sex, and something real, relaxing, yet it makes you want dance - GET THIS CD. Simply put, it is peace."
5,Brilliant!!,"I had not heard the music of Kindred but had seen their photos on the Hidden Beach website. I came to New York for a long weekend a few days ago from here in the UK of which I went into the HMV store in Harlem, I was buying a few CD's for friends when one of the guys who worked there asked me to listen to their album,BOY I WAS HOOKED JUST FROM LISTENING TO 4 TRACKS!!! not only did i but a copy for myself but one for a good friend of mine, and I recommend EVERYONE!! TO GET THIS ALBUM because it's just BRILLIANT!!!!!!"
4,True love wrote this album...,"Peaches and Herb, Nick and Val, now Kindred. Their lyrics are peace on earth, and their harmony is heaven. It's been awhile since a male/female duo could evoke such truly believeable coupled soul...they are an addition to the Philadelphia neo-soul sound of Musiq and Jill Scott. It must be in the Philadelphia water, because Kindred is constant with every song. Nothing superficial about them. They have blessed voices. They aren't simply entertainment, THEY ARE TALENTED! Get the album and have your faith in love songs redeemed without the sappy stuff."
5,Rhythm of Life,"I first heard ""Far Away"" on the radio and was like whoa!,i got this as a (EID) present, me and my friend were like uh-oh they're Muslims too, but this is a good album that displays the love Aja and Fatin have for each other and their children,some of my personal favorites are ""Rhythm of Life"" ""Weather the Storm"" ""Stars"" ""Family Song"" ""Contentment"" ""If I"" ""Party's Over"" and ""What happens now"" altogether it's a good album, i liked it, and like Ryva said,they are indeed divinity personified. Feel the soul of the soulflower, peace."
2,not one of my favorites,"Kindred is a talented husband and wife team whose voices demonstrate the strength of their spiritual bond. With songs like ""Stars"" and ""Far Away"", the duo address issues common to many married couples. However, ""Surrender to Love"" often degenerates into simplistic lyrics and that annoying, sing-song cadence that is so often associated with spoken word."
3,i want to give it four stars tho... jus cant do it...,"kindred!this is a very very good cd... they are a neo-styled ashford and simpson! good musical concepts... good musicianship... i have never seen them in a live setting, but i bet that would be a TEN-STAR performance!!! however, i'm jus not pushed over with this studio-album overall... no fault of the wonderful artists displayed here... they do an excellent job, fareal yall... her vocals are jus a tad bit reminiscent of jill scott's (not a bad thang at all!) and his are a deep, forceful 'moan' that you dont hear coming from male artists anymore/he proly coulda been a member of the temptations back in the day (or even now! the temptations are still doin their thang!)... maybe this will grow on me over time, but for the grownfolks out there wanting somethin to bite into, this wouldnt be the FIRST cd i'd recommend them to get, but i wouldnt discourage them from getting it either... a very solid debut."
1,Save your money,"It is sad that people have been listening to crap for so long that htey would consider this a good cd. There is nothing that differentiates this cd or this music from any oth the hundreds of mindless, musically-challenged, non-artists out there today. It could have been Erika, Gil, India or Bonequitia ""singing"" any of those ""songs"". Save your money for real musicians who refuse to be mundane."
4,They Jam!!!,"I saw this group in concert twice. They gave an awesome concert!!! I can't wait to see them again soon. Standing in the shadows on Ashford and Simpson, this couple has love and power in their music, with a soul appeal. I can listen to this album over and over. It is a must have!E"
4,Wonderful CD,"This is a great cd! It is full of good soul that soothes the spirit. It is wonderful to see a husband and wife team make such good music together. My favorites are ""Far Away"", ""Rhythm of Life"", ""If I"" and ""What Happens Now""."
5,AWESOME,"This is an excellent album. It has great music well put together lyrics, and it is very mellow. It is much better than the other garbage r and B groups that are around here making music to pollute our minds."
4,Can't Get Enough!!!,They are definitely Kindred Spirits!!!This project is one of the Best that I have heard in a long time!
3,Pretty Good set,i got to hear this set recently&from what I heard I thought it was pretty good.the balance of the vocals&Musicianship were nice&the lyrics were cool as well.this is a Set that has some cool moments.
1,Don't waste your money.,"This particular product was mentioned on the local news in my area. Their fact based review on the ""Love Bug"" was that there is no scientific evidence to support the theory of why this product will work. On a side note: there are people attempting to get this and other products that claim to do the same thing off the market to save consumers from wasting their money on products that make claims which they can't hope to live up to.I hope this helps.(I wouldn't have even given it a star, except amazon doesn't have negative values)"
3,First Alert Battery-Powered Carbon Monoxide Alarm,This item is the perfect intersection of quality and price. Very easy to use.
2,Bring Back the Live Albums,"Enough greatest hit packages. True Chicago fans want Carneige Hall and Japan. Though this would be good for some people and just in time for valentines day, most of these songs are from Chicago's ballad eighties era. For me and many others Chicago died with Terry Kath. Though they still made decent music it can never match the brilliance of their first five albums. This one though will make my wife happy but leave me yearning for Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon."
1,Enough already!!!,"Is there another band out there that releases as many greatest hits packages as Chicago? They are shameless, and this is coming from a longtime fan. Someone please count up the number of repackaged greatest hits collections they have put out since the original Chicago IX all those years ago. I saw this latest collection in the store today and began to laugh that they found yet another way to push their music, some of which is pretty tired to say the least. Give it a rest guys please! Put out a quality album of new material and re-release Carnegie Hall and Live in Japan. No more greatest hits!!!"
4,Perhaps just a rumor...?!,"Try to look for the European version of the album. The song list is slightly different from the US one, but the surprise is that you got 2 Peter Cetera Songs: Glory of Love and The Next Time I Fall. Tell me people, what do you think about this?"
1,Another ridiculous repackage!!!,How many times has Chicago repackaged their songs to be bought over and over again? Tacking on two sub-par live performances to entice completists is an insult and another blow to their ever-dwindling fan base. It's high time that the band and their management stop insulting their fans by asking them to buy the same stuff over and over again and instead record something new and worthwhile. DON'T BUY THIS CD - SEND A MESSAGE TO CHICAGO THAT THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.
2,ANOTHER COMPILATION!!!,"I like to think of myself as one of the biggest Chicago fans around; I've seen them many times in concert, including the most recent tour with Earth, Wind & Fire. I think it's great that they've included the two live tracks from the Chicago/EWF tour on this CD, but enough is enough! These are GREAT musicians, and it's time for a NEW STUDIO album! I simply cannot believe how many compilations and greatest hits packages Chicago has released in the past fifteen years! I will not buy an album of previously released tracks simply because there are two new songs. Chicago, be good to your fans and treat them to some new stuff...PLEASE!!!"
3,"GREAT! ANOTHER ""GREATEST HITS"" FROM CHICAGO!","I'm sure Chicago ranks as one of the greatest American rock groups ever. I live in Spain and, perhaps, Chicago is my all time favorite group. I love songs like ""You're the inspiration"", ""Chasin'the wind"", ""Look Away"", ""What kind of man would I be"", ""Hard to say I'm sorry"" ...and many others. I have those songs in all the albums Chicago has released. I also have them in no less than 4 ""greatest hits"" albums. And enough is enough. I will buy every new album by Chicago, but buying all over again the same songs ...it just makes no sense. If you are new to Chicago's music, this is a great album. The problem to the grown-up Chicago fans is that we already have many albums like this. It's hard to say I'm sorry; but it seems like it's harder to say good bye..."
3,Could have been better,"I was surprised that Love Me Tomorrow was left off this collection.Otherwise,see the first two reviews.-They pretty much sum it up."
1,Love Songs ? Old re-hash,"Please...give up the ""Greatest Hits"" era. Let's try just one new release of unheard material or maybe it's about time to get S.O.S. off of the shelf, clean it up, and get it out there so those who haven't heard it get a chance to see what Chicago can do when they want to work it.Time to stop treating us to more re-packages."
3,"Good, but not great.","This book is a great primer to understanding the Paleo-Indian culture. However, there are many gramatical errors and errors in the use of certain words. The book is difficult to read. A second edition is in order. The pictures of the paleo artifacts are good, but descriptions are difficult to understand since many pictures of the black flint tools are void of visual detail. A bibliography would be helpful, and a list of definitions would be more that helpful."
2,DATED!!!,"This book asks if sociological findings on the black middle class in the first half of the 20th century are true in the latter half. Some of the hypothesizes are so bourgeois, it's hard to believe that any black person actually believed them.Still, this book focused only on presumably straight, black men. It doesn't interview black women, even though blacks have debated whether Friedan's ""feminine mystique"" even applies to them for decades. Don't let James Evans' position on Florida's working fool you: most black women were not barred from working by their husbands.Next the book lists the marital status of the black interviewees and just assumes that all of them would want female marriage partners anyway. Yes, this book was published only two years after the Stonewall Riots, but it still feels painfully heterosexist as a modern reader.Still, if you like books like ""Black Metropolis"" and ""The Black Bourgeoisie"", you might as well read this too. I just wasn't pleased by this text generally."
4,"Funny, albeit odd, Idle jabs relentlessly at Palin.","I love Eric Idle. His work is hilarious. This is not an exception.Very weird, this CD will best be appreciated by people who can understand the strangest of Python. Because this CD is weird. It's almost bordering on Graham Chapman Concrete Inspector or Find the Fish weird. Still, it's got some brilliantly funny moments including the General Gucci song, Killing For God (an ironic song if I ever heard one) and Paranoia.Eric's done better. But this is quite funny. Don't buy it if you can't handle strange. If you can however, and you're willing to listen several times, this CD can yield great rewards."
1,I Hope the Next Bit is Funny,"Those seven words must have crossed my mind at least a dozen times while playing this disc for the first time. But the mantra failed to generate any aural nirvana: this is a bad disc.To do the compare-and-contrast thing: compared to the Python CDs, it is extremely bad. Compared to Idle's contributions on the Python CDs, it is slightly less than extremely bad. Compared liberally to Idle's various work, from 'The Rutles' to 'Road to Mars' to 'Pass the Butler', it is no longer extremely bad but is still quite bad. On the whole, then, I'd say it's bad.Idle hands are indeed the devil's work here."
5,Excellent Introduction to Progressive Christian Thought,"It's short and to the point. One of the best introductions to the fundamentals of progressive Christianity. It is definitely going on my Christian Education ""must read"" list."
4,Blowing the Lid Off the God-Box,Too often we lack the humility to let God be God. Our thinking about God becomes a projection of our own limited beliefs and prejudices. This short book puts the issue into perspective.
2,Duplication of other Cartoon Craze Porky Pig DVDs,"Caution, this DVD duplicates many cartoons from other Cartoon Craze Porky Pig DVDs."
2,Disappointing for the price,"For the money the quality is not there. I bought it for a business acquaintance and we never got together so I ended up eating the whole basket myself. Not stellar flavor or quality, everything tasted like the items sold at the supermarket. Dry cookies with no additional flavor, no one item stood out as ""awesome"" tasting. For that money I would have gotten just cheese and wine. Very very disappointing."
4,Good for gifting to someone special,"If you are looking to gift someone with gourmet food gift basket, I guess these would be good choice. The number of items are large, and they all seem to be quality items."
1,"NO Cheese, Nothing pictured!","I am incredibly embarrassed about this basket. Here I thought I was sending something of substance- based on the seller's description and the picture and the cost. My sister in law, who suffered an incredibly life threatening illness received this basket from my out of town family, thinking it was something for her to use to offer guests and local relatives a snack with tea when they visited. NO CHEESE IN THIS BASKET AND NOTHING EXPENSIVE. There were crackers and a school lunch size packet of chocolate chip cookies. I am so embarrassed. Many other companies offer less expensive baskets with greater goods. Don't order this basket. Barb DV."
2,Pretty basket with tasteless goodies??!!,"My mother had a major surgery and since my sisters and I live out of state we wanted to give her something extra special to help cheer her up. I ordered this basket, being the largest one, paid a hefty price and even paid the extra money to have it overnighted. She received it the next afternoon at 2:30, which is rather late for the extra $30 I was charged. Though the basket was pretty the yummies were described by my sister staying with her as, dry and tasteless. That made me really sad because I really wanted something extra special"
2,was not happy!,some of the products were stale. Gave this as a gift to my brother and he told me about 4-5 of the items were bad.
1,Obscenely disgusting...,"What can I say? No plot, no story, no acting. I was embarrassed to have been watching this, but it did have one redeeming quality. The gross out. It's got some of the worst gore I've ever scene in a horror film."
5,100 Questions and Answers about Epilepsy,This book is am e Bellamy resource regarding epilepsy. I highly recommend it if you need more information about epilepsy or epilepsy treatments.
5,Television warps the mind,"In these days of media saturation and convergence, the effects of television on our minds has become a hot topic. Paul Rutherford has taken an interesting angle in the debate over TV.An expert in television commercials, Rutherford has compiled an exhaustive study of how Public Service Announcements play a part in derailing democracy. By dictating morality and creating an atmosphere of shame, PSAs take away our right of free thought.Endless propaganda is one of the most engaging media books released in the recent past. An excellent companion to McLuhan and Gitlin."
3,"""Time's Makin' Changes"" is better...","This CD restores two songs that were woefully missing from ""Time's Makin' Changes: The Best of Tesla"" - ""Hang Tough"" and ""Call It What You Want"". It also throws in a nice ballad called ""Tried So Hard"". But in doing so, it leaves out three other great tunes - ""Gettin' Better"", ""Changes"" and the song that is one of Tesla's top two or three best-known, ""Little Suzi"", along with a few others available on ""Time's Makin' Changes"". So, despite the digital remastering, I would say that ""Time's Makin' Changes"" is your better bet. Perhaps someday they'll get it right..."
3,"Average product, not too bad for the price","This might be a nice gift for someone new to running. The bottle is nice, big and solid, but not to carry around. I use it at home or at picnics. The t-shirt has a nice girly cut, not too tight and not too loose. The turquoise color is really nice and helps your visibility. The fabric is breathable, or they say so. It still gets wet, just gets dry quicker than cotton."
1,suckysuckysuck,this game just sucks.it was never meant for any one system.espetially on the gba.grafics suck game play is not hulkish enough and d--n this game reeks of strdegy.who wants the hulk too be stragedy?this game is pointless just forget it exists.
5,I would give this 10 stars if I could....,"10-07-2012 Update: Still no fire ants!We had a huge fire ant problem on our acreage, over 50 different mounds...I did my research and ordered this product and also Bengal Ultra Dust here on Amazon. We actually tried the Bengal Dust 1st...approximately 10 days to 2 weeks after using it, all the ants were not only still alive, but actually using the dust to help build their colonies! (Okay, that may be a bit of exaggeration, but the ants were all still alive and well). So, we went back and used the Amdro granules, and within 2 days all the ants were dead...I mean all of them! It has been over 1 month since we used it and we still haven't seen an ant!! As the other reviewers say, this stuff works great!!!"
2,"Nice pen, poor ""lifetime"" warranty","I have owned several Cross pens since graduating from high school in 1968. I have owned this Townsend pen for many years and paid about $100. The refills are expensive but that comes with the territory. However, the friction fit cap is problematic. There is a nylon or plastic liner in the cap which fails to grasp the pen over time. I have had it replaced once, and now need to do it again. Good news is that Cross offers a ""free lifetime"" repair warranty. The bad news is that Cross charges $10 ""handling"" charge for this free service, after the customer pays to ship it back to them. Free ain't what it used to be. Sorry, Cross, but I would not recommend the Townsend series in any flavor."
5,Beautiful gift,I ordered this pen as a congratulations gift for a co-worker's promotion. It is beautiful and they were very pleased.
5,Small size for your pocketbook,Wanted these glasses for my husband so he could read the menuwhen we go out to dinner. They are small enough to fit intoa purse and the case prevents the glasses from getting scratched.I ordered the glasses with a 1.75 prescription lens which I couldnot find at my local stores.
2,About the metal tube.,"The lens quality was VERY good, but the quality was bad tube, opened alone. And that is not highly recommended."
2,Not the greatest but can't find anything better,Have three pair of these. Two of them have lost the plastic nose pieces. All of them have lost the pocket clip on the case. The two halves of the case quickly lose their snug fit and are constantly coming apart. On the plus side the optics are good and the size of the glasses and case are just right. Wish I could find something better in this style.
2,Poor Quality,The clip on the case of this product broke the first time I used it. The reason I purchased the product was because of the case and clip. Would not recommend.
4,Compact Reading Glasses,These reading glasses are excellent for carrying on one's person as they come in a thin small compact case. I like the fact that they are not bulky and do not take up much room in my pants pocket.
1,"No Bargain, Soft, Dull, and Low Quality","I was delighted to find these online, as they are a bit difficult to find elsewhere. They arrived totally dull, and look to be of very low quality. I would never buy them again. I suggest you spend a bit more, as the other reviewer reported. I wish I had. I ended up having them sharpened, which cost me additional $. This would turn me off to other CMT products. I will not use them in the future. I rarely leave negative reviews, but this product is substandard."
1,Big disappointment,"I purchased these after reading favorable reviews. These knives are dull,very dull and need sharpening (not just honing) before using. They are not usable as is and are a total waste of money. Save your money and sharpen your old knives. I purchased a set of Freud knives from Amazon earlier and they are outstanding. I highly recommend spending the extra money for the Freud. This is my first and last CMT product. The only good comment I can make about the CMT knives is that you can handle them without any fear of cutting yourself."
1,Broke within months,"The pen ran out of ink within four months of light use. When I attempted to replace the cartridge the mechanism that allows you to twist the pen to expose or retract the point broke, rendering it useless."
4,Very Comfy,"Super comfortable on the face with very thick lining. It did accumulate moisture when my brother was wearing it,,, but when I wore it there were no problems, I guess it depends on facial structure... clear visibility and protects against the sun."
5,JOY,"I rarely write any product reviews, but this warranted taking the time. After being recommended to me, I got Last of the Donkey Pilgrims out of the library, and immediately knew it was a book I had to own - I wanted to savor every chapter for as long as I could. As Mr O'Hara takes his journey along the Irish perimeter, you are right along with him marveling at the Irish coastline and relishing the people he encounters. It is a laugh-out-loud funny, poignant, joyful work by an exceptional storyteller. I have recommended it to several people, none have been disappointed. Priceless, a must read."
4,just a nurse?,"I'm not an animal person at heart, and really not a donkey person. I'm a nurse, like Kevin. His ability to learn to care for a donkey and come alongside the men, women and children of Ireland is admirable. He's comfortable meeting people where they are, like nurses often do. His insight into the human spirit helps the reader respect whatever made each unique character special. Nonetheless, not even the best nurse would have the courage to attempt this journey without a strong faith foundation. His story made me believe that God travels beside us and makes life fun and exciting, especially when we are counting on a daily miracle. I'm not sure what put such a crazy idea in his head, but I'm glad he shared his adventure with the rest of us. I'll read it again in Ireland!"
5,Discover Ireland first hand!,"This book is a gem for anyone of Irish descent wanting to understand the country and its' people better. I may never get to visit all those towns and regions of Ireland and Northern Ireland, but now I feel I have been to them all anyway!This book gave me an even stronger bond and familiarity with Ireland and the special people there. It was almost like I was there with Kevin O'Hara exploring all those towns, scenery, and country roads (and pubs) of Ireland, I want to thank him so much for sharing that with all of us!I highly recommend this book, it isinformative, entertaining and very funny, in addition to bringing the reader back to Ireland with the author as he tours the entire perimeter of Ireland with his Donkey Missie and cart."
5,The Black Echo - Michael Connelly,Michael Connelly has the gift of making plots lead to the unexpected - the twists and turns don't stop until the last page! Great read.
4,Black Echo,I had been trying to decide what my first purchase for my Kindle Fire would be. After reading a sample of The Black Echo on your sight I wanted more. It also showed me that it was the first in a series by Michael Connelly that featured Harry Bosch. It's a wonderful book and I'm sure the others will be also enjoyable. I'm not into romance novels. Mystery-Thrillers keep my attention and when I find a really great charter it is hard for me to put my Kindle down.
5,thank goodness,I have been casting about since Robert Parker died to find an author who has a series based on one character. There have been many happy successes and more failures. Bosch is an incredibly complex character. The plots of this and his other books do not disappoint. I read this and am working my way from the 1990's to 2013. I am enjoying getting acquainted with a great detective and the author who created him
4,Bravo for Bosch,"1) Sit back in a comfy chair with a beverage2) The story really grabs you up front - Dead guy in pipe, how did he get there, how did he die, who called 911?3) Bosch shows up. After about 10 minutes on the scene, he has identified enough ""clues"" that show this is a homicide. This always impresses me. Of course, Encyclopedia Brown used to dazzle me as well.4) No one is going to get in the way of Bosch doing the right thing and solving the crime. They guy is a one man HR nightmare. Yet, he gets results.5) Some lady with problems is going to be drawn to Bosch. As a loner this is cool, but he isn't going to be on eHarmony anytime soon himself.6) Bosch never stops working the case. I swear that I have to take naps during my reading, so I can try to catch clues that will solve the case.7) In the end, only Bosch ""sees"" enough of the landscape to put things together to solve the crime8) Michael Connelly has this genre down cold. I immediately bought the next two books for my iPad."
4,Totally Engrossing,"Michael Connelly's fiction debut, The Black Echo, is an excellent crime novel, well done, compelling. Connelly hit a home run on the first pitch. The story is readable, with many interesting twists--but nothing over the top. The dialogue sparkles and the characters are real. I picked this one up after enjoying his latest in the Harry Bosch series--City of Bones--just to see how the story began. The Black Ice is good enough to keep you reading the entire series. Enjoy."
4,a good read,"James Lee Burke recommended this book in his top 5 of all time piece in a recent Newsweek, so thought I would try it. Very well written, great plot, and interesting reading a police procedural done before cell phones and current computer technology"
4,Very good police novel,"I enjoyed this book very much as far as the characters go. The crime involved was not quite as interesting, but still good enough and with enough twists to keep me interested until the end. And I have to admit, I also liked it because it took place in LA and all the locations mentioned and talked about I could relate to. I liked this book well enough that I've already bought Black Ice. Worth reading."
5,"Black Echo, Read it!","Again, another great Harry Bosch tale. The final outcome is well hidden, as always. This was a very thrilling story and I urge you to read it."
4,Oldie still a good read,I was recommended to try the Author but prefer to start a series from the begining and what a great read. Even for it's time it takes you back before Mobile phones and desk computers and the story keeps you involved. I will be looking for the next in the series soon.
4,Welcome to the world of Harry Bosch,"This book is the first in the Harry Bosch series, and Harry Bosch is a great character. Off-beat homocide detective who you grow to love throughout the story. Excellent telling of the capers that he is investigating that gives the reader hints to the outcome so that the reader can solve the mystery themselves along with Harry. Well written, (unabridged audio cassette is very well preformed), and a great story all around. I'm looking forward to reading the next Harry Bosch book - Black Ice. Great writing Michael Connelly!"
3,"""The Black Echoooo""","Like the the word Echoooo in the title for my review, this story, though OK, was stretched out way too long. Based in L.A./Hollywood this story did touch on the freightening lives of ""tunnel rats"" in Vietnam and the horrible way some Veterans are treated by our society. The story was enough to keep me interested, however the action and suspense was lacking."
2,Good story with a very contrived ending,"I liked this book, but the revelations about a certain character's involvement in the case within the last 30 pages ruined it for me. It was way too farfetched and just not right."
5,I wish I had started the series with the first story,"I like the problem solving procedure, gut reactions and applying experience to the issues. The background explanations help with the mindset of the investigated"
4,slow start,"i liked this book a lot, but to me, it started out slow. I enjoy the author but I think I enjoy the Mickey Haller series more. I like Harry with Mickey as well."
4,Love Harry Bosch novels,I've recently gotten hooked on Michael Connelly detective novels. This is a really good one. I like the way he intertwines the crime investigation with the detective's personal life.
4,Already owned,Again I bought this book not realising that I already had a hard back copy but the story is a good one so I am not dissappointed
3,A slow read,"I had a difficult time sticking with this book. It some long stretches of musing as well as inner conflicts. Toward the ending it began to get in the main story line and was a exciting read. I got the inner turmoil early on but felt it had been addressed but just a lot of rehashing. The main characters were interesting enough, just felt the ending was a little too tied up with unbelievable twists."
5,Great book from Connelly,"I always liked Michael Connelly's books. He is a master in mixing the right amount of suspense, action, and art. This book is no exception!"
2,Connelly disappoints,"I've been anxious to read this book because I enjoyed The Poet,Blood Work and Void Moon so much. But Black Echo was really disappointing. Way too long. Too detailed. I get more empathy and description out of a character in one page of Robert Crais than with Harry Bosch. I'm hoping the others are better, and I'll give second in series a try. Do they get better?"
4,Compelling,"I enjoyed this book a lot. I found myself interested in the main character, the L.A. community which is an integral 'character' in the story and the well-written supporting characters and street scenes. I read one reviewer's comment that many of these scenes were cliched; what that reviewer overlooked is the timing of when the book was written--14 years ago."
2,Not best Bosch's job,"The book'll never hook you to the main story. At first you'll be thrilled with the story but as you read on and on you'll get bored. The book's end is childish, I mean why the stiff was killed. I've read many Bosch's stories and I don't recommend this flatly. Read the other books instead of this one."
3,slightly predictable if youve read others in series,After reading other connelly novels i decided to get others in the bosch series. The book was very fast paced and a good read but i found the outcome and criminal slightly predictable. The reason for the crimes seemed a slight reach and additional info seemed unnecessary. I still liked it enough to read the next in the series. 3 1/2 stars would probably be a better rating.
4,Great Read,"My first Michael Connelly book -- I WILL be back for more. Now, if only there were some other reasonably priced selections ....."
5,Flawless,"You can see why Connelly is where he is. In the beginning, nothing fits but by the end, everything does. And detective Harry Bosch, who starts with nothing but his moral compass and his instincts, ends up the same way. You can almost hear a muted trumpet wailing in the distance."
4,safe to backtrack Bosch fans,"I am a huge Connelly fan, so I bought the trilogy book of Connelly's first collection of Harry Bosch novels, settled into the very first one of the series ""The Black Echo"" and enjoyed it as much as his present day stuff (The Closers, The Narrows, etc.). I have read the reviews where other Bosch fans think that this one fell flat. Well, I totally disagree.I wish I would've been introduced to the Bosch series by reading this one from the start, but even as a backtracker, it was one of my favorite reads. This one had a nice finish. The Internal Affair Dept. cops were a little far-fetched but didn't kill my interest in this story. Don't be afraid to backtrack fellow Harry Bosch readers."
2,Zzzzzzzzzz,"I hate to stop reading a book in the middle, but I just couldn't help myself this time. This has got to be one of the most boring mysteries I have ever read. After awhile, I just decided to stop torturing myself and put it down. I don't know how anyone could give it a 5-star review. I'm giving it two stars because it was coherent, but I don't think I would read anything else by this author."
2,Unrelentless but too entangled,"An interesting complex case, though in my opinion the author approach to unfold it was too complex to follow, and at one point I got lost and have to read previous chapters again A pity he unveiled all the layers of the mistery in the last pages, it would have been most interesting a slow motion resolution step by step. Did not convince me at all."
2,ABridge(d) too far,"The story is fine but half the length of the unabridged Audible.com version. Many books can be improved by being abridged, this was probably not one of those."
1,Print on Demand Rip Off,"This review is for Amazon.com's sales tactics, not for Michael Connelly's writing.Amazon.com does not indicate on the Web page that this is a print-on-demand copy and not the publisher's original. They even use the publisher's original ISBN. Instead of a cloth-covered cover and a dust jacket, this book has a glossy printed cover (like most textbooks) and no dust jacket.This is the second time I ordered a ""new"" book from Amazon.com and received instead a print-on-demand book. The first one was Tinkers, by Paul Harding. That books falsely claims to be a first edition on the copyright page, while having a ""Winner of the Pulitzer Prize"" medallion printed on the front cover.A print on demand book should never be sold as if it were the original. I feel like I've been ripped off for $28.87."
4,Now I Get It,"I chose to read this novel when I heard that one of the television networks had optioned it and would be making a pilot for a proposed series about the central character, Harry Bosch. Considering this was the first book he appears in and I'd heard a lot of good things about Michael Connolly's works, I decided to give it a try. It was terrific. Quick, easy read, lots of Los Angeles references and landmarks which I always enjoy and some nice plot twists and deductive reasoning along the way. DG"
4,Black Echo,"This book is filled with suspense, odd twists and turns, and a surprise final twist at the end. The reader is left with a desire to continue to follow the characters in subsequent novels. An especially interesting novel for anyone who served in the Vietnam conflict."
4,Harry's past and how he met Eleanor,"Michael Connelly writes excellent books. This was not my favorite Harry Bosch novel, but it was still an enjoyable read. I had not read the book which introduced Eleanor Wish, and I enjoyed reading about her background and introduction into Harry's life."
4,Asecond read,"I have read this book before, I purchased it for a easy read and to add to my collection on my fire. I am a mystery addict. I really like the pace and the depth of the story. I found I myself more atoned to Harry and his Vietnam experences, dreams and flash backs. I just enjoyed this read and I will read it again. A good investment for me and any that enjoy this type of novel will find it interesting and engaging. Michael Connelly is a very good author, that sits the tempo and sceens and developes the chacters, plots with great skill."
3,The Black Echo,This book was a good book but it seemed to drag a little towards the end. I would read another book by Michael Connelly if given the chance.
2,For those with insomnia.,"I have been a fan of Harry Bosch and his creator, Michael Connelly, for some time. The Black Echo is part of a trilogy recently purchased by me. I am practically finished with The Black Echo, and have come to the following conclusion: If you have insomnia or a difficult time in falling asleep, try a minimum dose of Kirkland's Sleep Aid from Costco or something similar, and read several pages of The Black Echo. It is very effective in inducing sleep. I look forward to the next two of the trilogy, but The Black Echo is primarily used to help me fall asleep. In this regard it succeeds very well. Stan Epstein"
3,A bit slow,I found the book to be rather slow moving until a little after I was half way through it. After that point the book really holds your interest. Overall it's a good book but I think it would have been much better if the pace picked up much sooner.
4,Introducing Harry Bosch,"_The Black Echo_ introduces Harry Bosch-- the bitter LAPD detective named after the tortured painter. Black Echo won the Edgar for best first novel and gave us one of our best contemporary detective characters.Black Ice is still my favorite, but Black Echo is a must-read for fans of the darker side of the detective genre. Also introduces (and largely explains) Eleanor Wish, who will return with a larger role later in the series."
4,Good to near great crime novel,"This is for the Kindle version (though that fact shouldn't make any difference). This is the first Harry Bosch novel of the series and in fact the first novel of the author. It's a remarkable effort for a first novel and illustrates well what he will continue in his other works: simple, clean and crisp prose which moves along, rarely if ever bogging down. A few unusual plot twists. Well-described characters and places.However like one reviewer, I prefer the novel itself over the protagonist, Harry Bosch, LAPD Detective. I have to say I prefer the Haller books. Haller for some reason captures some sympathy or empathy for me; not so for Bosch.I give this 4 stars because of the unlikable nature of Harry and because of the very last plot twist. It was one too far, and left me a feeling of artificial manipulation by the author, reaching too much to trick the reader."
2,Reliability,"Beautiful machine as far as cosmetics, but so is a mercedes.And of course the high cost of maintenance, namely printercartridges. No capability for extra high capacity ink storageresulting in frequent changes whether machine is used for heavyor little use. Any fault in system disables all functions.Sometimes problem cannot be resolved with one color replacement,so better choice is to replace all colors at the same time whichincreases cost of operation.Disappointed!"
1,Stay Away From Brother MFC Series,"Buyers beware! I purchased an MFC-3220 just 3 months ago and have used it only as a fax machine printing black only. With previous experience on Epson and HP machines, I thought that i'd never have to replace the color cartridges. Well, it turns out Brother customer support says that air bubbles get into the cartridge and dry them out, even when you're not using them, meaning a $100 cartridge replacement every 3-5 months!A Call to customer support provided no help whatsoever, but they offered to take my order for new cartridges! Threw the MFC in the trash and picked up an HP.If you're looking for an MFC, stick to HP. It may cost more, but you'll save a ton of money on refillable cartridges."
2,"Great Fax, Copier, Printer - No PC fax or Color scanner","I got this unit to redue the clutter on my desktop after a HP K60 died on me a few months after the warranty expired. Also to scan my papers using the ADF to further reduce clutter.The stand alone functions fax, copier work great.However the PC based functions failed with the exception of the printer(I downloaded a separate driver from the site), The drivers for the PC fac and scanner failed to install on XP and millenium the MFC-3200c keeps being detected as 1800, tech support was unable to solve the problem at one point diabling my mouse.A good concept at a great price, if I had resloved the issues with driver installation I would have given it a 4 or 5. With the issues I give it a 2."
2,"Still dont know ""Who's Holdin""","Actually purchased this album because I was very intrigued by the title (also name of band). Thing is, I still dont have any idea ""Who's Holdin"". I gave it a spin several times (actually my cd player was stuck with this and others in it) but it now sits on my shelf collecting dust. The vocalist reminds me of Glenn Danzig. This is a good thing but unfortunatley, the band doesn't have an all to original sound."
2,CB,"Among the few remix CDs I bought, my opinion is that this one does not meet my expectations. In essence, money not well spent."
4,A Little More Insight,"This dvd covers the basics of the story of the Fatima apparitions of 1917 but adds info about the Basilica and shrine grounds which isn't usually discussed in Fatima dvds. It's a simple presentation but in the end it is yet another nice tribute to Our Lady of Fatima, Mother of Christ."
5,A Must to Watch,"I have been to Fatima and seen the area on a trip visiting my family. To see the place where this event took place, seeing the cathedral, and seeing where two of the children were buried. Reality hits you when you see this place in person. One may not believe this event, but an amazing story and how Catholics have an intense belief this event was factual event.There are events in our world we can never explain with logic, but have to go on faith that certain events just happen."
2,not good enough...,"it is more of a political documentary. does not add anything more to the baffling events of 1917 that the enthusiast already knows. the political side i am not so interested in, perhaps the post-event historical aspects are quite well mentioned here. somewhat disappointed in the lack of the materials surrounding the remarkable events...kt"
4,Great,He is funny and also tells a story. I truly wonder if this is about his personal life to some effect.
2,Went downhill fast..,"Wow, the first season was very entertaining, funny, well-acted and interesting. I've watched the first two episodes of this season, and frankly, they're depressing, short, not funny at all, and uncreative.I'm not sure what happened, but, I can't imagine this going well for him, if this is the tone of the rest of this season...at this point, I'm not paying for any additional episodes of Season 2.Terribly disappointing."
5,excellent,"loving it so far. better than 99% of the crap on tv. it's worth watching. louis c.k. is brilliant. check it out. you won't be disappointed,"
5,Not a Sitcom,"I agree with the other reviewer that there is a lot more darkness (drama?) in this season, but I am really enjoying it. There is still a lot of humor but this isn't a sitcom that you watch to get a couple of laughs (or groans, as is the case with most sitcoms nowadays.) I really like this material and don't know of anything else like it on TV. In addition to the characters and story lines, I really like the choice of music and the way it really pulls you in."
5,Not your typical comedy.,"This is not your typical, American sitcom comedy. The show follows the line of the first season, opening with a short stand up interlude, followed by a 'sitcom.' Some shows are chock full of hilarity, and others are not. This has got to be one of the artsiest shows I've seen in a long time.One of the things that I love about this show is that it mimics real life. It follows Louie, who is a stand up comedian. He is also a father, a divorced man, and a regular guy. His kids are pukes, or funny, or well behaved, etc. Not like other shows with kids who just spit out a 'cute' one liner, followed by a laugh track. A lot of the scenarios mimic real life b/c they are so mundane and not over the top (think of Rachel being able to afford that unbelievable apartment in Friends on a coffee house waitress's salary). Yes, there are things that the average person cannot relate to, but we are not a famous stand up comedian."
3,bottle not made correctly,The atomizer does not work properly. It is very hard to press down on the spray.
5,The perfect scent !,Dune! I absolutely adore this fragrance! I have been using it since its introduction in 1991 and it continues to be my favorite fragrance. I receive compliments on my smell every time I wear it! It makes me feel feminine and sexy and is very distinctive. I definitely recommend this one for the sophisticated ultra feminine woman!
4,FRESH AND ALLURING,"Fresh and alluring, Dune is the creation of the master of couture, Christian Dior. It gained instant popularity following its presentation in 1991.This blend of amber and wallflower tempered by the tang of sea air is beloved by sophisticates as well as ingenues, and is equally suitable for each.In later years a fragrance for men also called Dune was offered.For me, it's a perennial favorite and one I always enjoy wearing again."
1,There's no reason to see this,"Blitzkrieg Escape from Stalag 69 is a micro budget attempt at doing a Nazi exploitation film. Little effort was made to make the homes and backyards of Long Island look like Nazi Germany. No effort was made to cast actors who look like starving POWs or who can pull off a convincing German accent.Well OK, no one is buying something called 'Escape from Stalag 69' for historical accuracy. But it's not even good exploitation. There are a few scenes with Tatyana Kot as a Russian Partisan mowing down Nazis wearing combat boots and nothing else. But that's about it. The rest of the film is filled with feeble attempts at humor and shockingly bad cinematography.Save your time and money and stay away."
1,"If I could give this less than one star I would, but amazon wont let me.","I also saw this movie at the Pioneer Theater.I wish I hadn't. Not because of the ""gore"", or the ""offensiveness"" since there wasn't really much of either. The movie was dull, trite and poorly acted. The lead male character made me want to walk out of the movie every time he came on screen. Do not buy this movie. Just forget it exists. (Like I'm trying to)"
2,Novelty soft-psychedelia sixties rock,"I was made aware of this disc by an article in the English music mag Mojo about standout sixties soft rock obscurities. The Cyrkle, apparently, were a mid sixties outfit that opened for, and were a favorite of, the Beatles circa 1966. This was touted as the final and ""lost"" Cyrkle album, a soundtrack to a skin flick that sunk quickly into obscurity. I bit, expecting a goldmine of tuneful gems. The tracks do certainly have a unique late sixties pyschedelic feel, yet they are so lite they border on elevator music. The exceptions are ""Squeeze Play"", a nice little jingle doused with sixities technocolor, and ""The Rigging"", a great (...) instrumental break.The rest is forgettable and borderline annoying. The pictues from the film, however, found inside the CD booklet, are quite erm..titilating."
2,"It's a mediocre disk, Louise","James Baker said it all. But lemme say a few more things. MURRAY THE Y is a harmony-intensive track that's semi-enjoyable. The instrumental version of THE MINX is a Herb Alpert soundalike track. My favorite track is IT'S A LOVELY GAME, LOUISE. Which begins with those sweet 7th guitar chords. But the chords sound slightly out of tune. Which creates a weird poignancy. NICOLE is an expendable exercise in porno-raga, wherein Don Danneman's voice is nerdy-nasal to a sadistic extent."
3,"Inexpensive, works fine, but...","Just finished installing the Danco 80816 toilet tank repair kit. The price was good, and the kit eventually was installed and seems to work fine. But the written instruction sheet is very small for dual language instructions (8"" x 5.25"", single-sided) and the installation diagram also included therein is of little help. Getting the ""flexible refill tube"" positioned into the overflow tube using the included spring took a lot of guess work. Cheaply made, but the kit DOES work, once you figure out a way to install it. (I have to admit to still not being absolutely sure I did it correctly!) When this unit wears out and starts to leak, I'll likely replace it with a different brand."
5,Awesome,"Clear instructions. Repaired my toilet. All is working perfectly now. All for under $20 and I didn't have to call a plumber? Can't beat it. Highly, highly recommended!"
2,Works but loud!,"Bought this as a replacement for one that died in my toilet. Nice because it fit my shorter than standard toilet tank (the generic ones from home depot were too tall).But... (and I'm no plumber) This thing is super loud. When the water is filling the tank, it is super screechy and loud. I have messed around with the adjustments and nothing seems to get it to be quieter.Anyway... It works, but it's LOUD!"
2,"It works, for now.","The threaded rod was way too long for my toilet tank. I had to hacksaw about an inch off of each end for it to even fit. The clip for attaching the tube to the refill pipe is absolutely useless. I had to reuse the old one. The rubber stopper has rubber hinges. You're supposed to wrap it around the refill pipe and slide it to the bottom. However, my pipe had plastic hinges on it for the old stopper toward the bottom. I tried stretching the rubber around the hinges, but it really looked crooked and incorrect. I ended up just keeping the old stopper. This one is a huge leak risk the way it lays awkwardly from being wrapped around the hinges of the old stopper. It's completely possible this kit is incompatible with my toilet, but I only really needed the floater. I would not recommend this kit if you own a small American Standard brand toilet. Thankfully it wasn't very expensive or I'd have returned it instead of modifying it."
4,Excelente blues,"Lo primero que escuché de la banda de Dummer fue el tema Nine by Nine, que aparece en esa rara recopilción de Vertigo ""Heads Together"" (junto a bandas como Lasso, Legend, Jade Warrior, Tudor Lodge, Sunbird, Nirvana -UK-, entre otros). El tema en cuestión y título del disco es prácticamente cajun, con violines muy a la country, muy entretenido. Sin embargo el resto de temas del disco le hacen recordar a uno a la banda de Aynsley Dumbar, blues profundos, descarnados y melodiosos, con bases ritmicas sólidas y de espectral ambiente. Hay que darle una especial atención a covers como Statosboro blues o el bonus track Walkin'the dog. Hay que tenerlo y gozarlo."
3,spice,"Nice quality, not particularily inspriring. Packed well, came quickly, would do business with this company again. Looks just like picture advertised."
2,Lacking flavor,Not much directions on the bottle for how much rub to place on your meat. I eyeballed it thinking I had enough but you could hardly taste it. The power on it's own is also not very flavorful. Just decided from now on to make my own marinade with spices that I have on hand which is easy enough.
1,Not good (at least to my taste buds),"Bought this trying to replicate my local shawarma restaurant. Not even close. Shawarma varies quite a bit though, but I have traveled extensively and this does not match any shawarma flavor I have had in the middle east or Europe."
2,Sort of tasteless,Was disappointed in this spice blend. When I lived in SFO I was absolutely hooked on both Chicken and Lamb Shawarma from an Arab restaurant in the Haight...just yummy so I was excited when I saw this Shawarma spice as I no longer live in the City. Spice was very bland tasted sort of old and dusty. Will keep experimenting and try grinding fresh spices rather than buying a blend next time.
5,Strange and prophetic,"I first read this book as a student in the 1960's and was puzzled but liked it. It seemed, to quote Nabokov, a violin in a void. Suddenly in 1989 I realised it is a prophecy about the Fall of Communism, its symbolism very close to what actually happened: the State and its ideology - once wielding real power and terror- have withered to an absurd shell, its rewards and blandisments have someting of senile infantilism about them, only its power as a death-dealer is apparently undiminished. The victim, Cincinnatus, suddenly realises he has had enough, stands up and comes to his senses and the whole idiotic apparatus of oppression crumbles to dust. It could have been the story of Prague, Budapest, Warsaw or East Berlin in 1989. My favourite Nabakov, it is a beautiful, haunting and unforgettable piece of writing."
3,Perhaps not the best intro to Nabokov,"This is the first of Nabokov's books that I've read and was rather unimpressed by it. I understand that Nabokov has what might be described as a ""cult"" of followers, and perhaps some of his other novels are better for the first-time reader than ""Invitation."" I was put off by his strange plot twists and overt symbolism. I will not deny that Nabokov is a fine writer, and I've since read and enjoyed several of his short stories. But as an introduction to ""Nab,"" this is perhaps not his best, and as far as dystopian novels go, I'd choose Orwell's ""1984"" over ""Invitation"" any day."
4,This book will keep you on your feet,"When you start reading this book, you dont want to stop. It keeps you comming back for more. Ian creates these images in your head of exactly how the scene is with a wonderful variety of adjectives. Definitly number one on my list."
1,Terrible on the Kindle,"This book was recommended to me, so I ordered it on line immediately without reading reviews...oops.In my opinion, this is a book that should be read in paper form. It is terrible on the kindle. Font not readable, too light, bullet points all screwed up, surveys not readable, and certainly not reproducible.It would be nice to have a hard copy of this book, and have the author reimburse for the kindle version. (I waited longer than 7 days, or I would have returned it and gotten the hard copy.)Anyway, truly, it is hard to talk about the content of the book due to its lack of readability on the kindle. Sorry that I can not give more information about the book itself.I do not know a better way to get the point across other than give it a 1-Star, and hope someone cares.Anyway - buy the hard copy, because it seems to me that those that did have really liked it."
4,Excellent book for change managers,"This book can be used by beginners and experienced change managers alike. It is a great complement to Kotter's first book on leading change. It is precise, easy to read and very clear. I got a lot out of it. It also contains useful tools that change managers can use in their work."
3,Just for Solal fans,"The musicianship of the three players, as well as the mastery of their respective instruments, is out of question. However, this album is clearly oriented by Solal's approach to jazz, which sometimes is difficult to follow. At times introspective, at times technically overwhelming, the angularities of his playing are reserved to those specialists who really appreciate him. On the other hand, the lack of commercialism deserves full respect. And it is surely useful for those interested in instrumental technique, for the piano, bass or drums."
4,Great introduction to Marx,"This book was perfect for an introduction to Marx. As a Libertarian, I needed to understand the thinking behind the man and philosophy that has swept the world. Recommended to anyone who needs a synthesis."
3,Cute.,"Cute little gem. Easy enough. A bit boring, but maybe that's Marx's fault and not Singer's. The last chapter is the best: a great overview of what Marx got right and what he got wrong."
2,Old and in the way,"This book was written in 1980. I haven't read much Marx, just the ""Communist Manifesto,"" and this is the first book about Marx I've read, but it seems clear enough that there is substance and truth in Marx's thought, and that the subject deserves to be treated with respect. A serious philosophical study of Marx should be free of the prejudices against Marxist thought that an American or British writer will most likely have. I believe this small book covers the basics of Marxist theory (although it skips Marx's thinking about the arts, gender relations, etc.) but the evaluative conclusion is filled with all the typical ""Cold War Era"" cliched opinions you'd expect, about how the leaders of Communist countries own private cars while the real proletariat walk, etc. Oxford University Press should find a scholar of philosophy to write a new ""Very Short Introduction"" to Marx which is relevant to this century."
1,Don't buy this crap from here,"I bought three of these kits...all of them stated that a pair of AAA batteries were included, however, they were not in any of the boxes. Also there is one dead CPU in one box, and one dead remote control in another box. Really poor quality. These were clearly open item packages as serveral items in each box were out of the plastic bag or the plastic bags were gone. I suspect someone tampered witht he goods at some point."
2,Utterly Pointless,"This book doesnt seem to have any head or tail. Half the time I wonder what exactly Im supposed to do, and WHY I should be doing it. The author does not properly impress upon the reader the reasons why each subtopic might be important, so you come away with the idea that ""well, we're doing it this way because some mathematician did it this way in the past"".Unfortunately, I suspect this is the case with most, if not all books dealing with discrete math.(Note: This is from a Computer Science Major, maybe math majors have a different view)."
1,Poor explanations; difficult to understand.,"This discrete math book is just too difficult to understand and doesn't help the reader. Nothing is explained well, although lots of words are used. Also, it seems like the author thinks the readers are stupid."
1,What a worthless waste of paper!,"This is absolutly the worst math book I have ever seen, and I've taken a lot of math classes. The only reason I made sense of any of the material in this book is because I have had a lot of the same material covered in other classes. Many of my class mates did not have that advantage and it's unfortunate that the math department at my school made such a poor choice in a text. The examples were unclear. The information was presented in the wrong order to be understandable. I threw it in the trash after the bookstore told me there is a new version out. Unbelievable"
3,Discreet?,"First I must say;I HATE DISCREET MATH, but with this book, I was able to muddle through even though the professor never even used one page from it after he recommended buying it."
4,Good book IF you know how to use it.,"This is a solid math book that covers every topic you'll need to know in the area. Make no mistake this is not a kid's book, and one must know how to study and read math in order to utilize it to the full potential. Many people that rate math books poorly do so because they have not developed adequate skills in studying math. If you take your time, work out the examples with the book, read and read again all of the concepts are about as clear as they can come from a math book. Most teachers/professors prefer to use their own examples, because that's how they abstract the problem in their own mind. It's easier to create a problem, than sit down and observe a premade example. Aside from some slightly screwy lesson organization it is a solid book. If you have patience, and try to do more than briefly skim over a lesson to understand it this book will be more than adequate for the topic."
3,too wordy for math majors,"I just used this text for a discrete math course. Most of us were computer science majors and many of them struggled with the math and with the text. This is the audience the text is written for and the author tries to explain everything assuming very little about the student's prior knowledge. This math is obviously hard for non-math majors. If they need to learn it, I haven't seen any Discrete Math text that does a better job for this group.The book is too simple and wordy for math majors, very strong computer science students and future math teachers. A better approach might be a book like D. Smith's A Transition to Advanced Mathematics for logic, sets, counting, mathematical induction, relations, and functions, combined with Chartrand's Introductory Graph Theory.One could use this book at the high school level for a senior level discrete math course for strong students preparing for computer science as an alternative to taking pre-calculus."
1,Absolutely Horrible!,"I am a second year Computer Science student and I have to agree with the rest of the bad reviews because the biggest problem I had with this book was that unlike other math textbooks which have the answers to most of the odd problems, this book only answered selected exercises in the text. I also remember the horrible memories I had about staying up very late at night trying to solve the problems in this book and what made things worse was that I did not have a good instructor either. I barely passed this course and I bought other math books to try and solve some of the problems in the book, but it didn't work. I hate it when mathematics professors try to be a big shot and show off their work by making it too complex and having little or no examples of how to do the problems in the book. I agree with one of the reviewers by saying that this book should be ""For Math majors Only"". If you are not required to buy this textbook, DON'T! Save your money and invest it in another one."
1,Worst Math Book Ever!,"By far this is the worst math book I have ever encountered. The author introduction of the subject is very weak and brief. She tries to compensate for this lack of detailed explanation by introducing ""lousy"" examples that does nothing for the most part but confuse the reader even more. I have had several advanced math courses, and read numerous math textbooks, but this is the worst!In short, this book is not worth the HIGH price, in fact it's not worth even the paper on which it was printed. I was ""forced"" to purchase this book for a course, which is required for my major.If you do not have to buy this book, then don't!"
4,Excellent book,This book was one of the best math books I've ever read. Just being able to say that speaks for itself; reading math books isn't the easiest thing in the world. Each subject is full of examples to solidify your understanding of the topic.
1,TERRIBLE,"This book should NEVER be allowed to be used by students for undergraduate Math classes. It is unclear, confusing, lacking clear examples and too presumptuous of the readers current skill level. I am amazed and astounded that people consider this text as the 'Best Math book ever'. IT IS HORRIBLE."
5,Wonderful book beautiful Photos,This is a great book with easy to follow instructions and absolutely beautiful photos. the recipes are great you will enjoy this book.
2,A Bit Confused,"Somehow, if it was there, I missed the fact that the book I ordered was written as a play. I had read the Clavell title, The Children's Story, many years before and remembered it as a story, not a play. The basics of the story are still there, but because it was written as a play, I feel reluctant to share it with a friend who generally doesn't read fiction, and may feel uncomfortable reading a script."
4,The New Teacher is not far away...,"I would say it was a chilling look at fears from the past, or a chilling view of the future. But in reality, that future could nearly be upon us. In fact in some ways, it already is.Read it before the Fearless Leader decides it contains WRONG thoughts. and it could confuse too many of you that are already prone to tune into the WRONG broadcasts..."
4,An intriguing work of speculative political fiction,"""The Children's Story,"" by James Clavell, is a short book that could be read in one brief sitting. It takes place in an elementary school classroom in the United States after the country has been conquered by some nameless foreign power. The story follows the initial re-education of the children by their new teacher.This book reads very much like a product of the Cold War era, when many feared the possibility of ultimate Soviet domination. The story is written with a subtly chilling, ""Twilight Zone""-like flavor; it reminded me of Ayn Rand's short book ""Anthem."" Ultimately, Clavell's scenario plays out a little too neatly to be truly believable. But the story is undeniably thought-provoking. And even with the U.S./U.S.S.R. Cold War now a thing of the past, ""The Children's Story"" is still worth reading."
5,The Children's Story (by James Clavell),"I first read this disturbing little book in 1981, in hardback and before it was given a subtitle, and I promptly bought a dozen copies to send to friends. Re-reading it now, 20 years later and in a significantly changed political climate, I find it even scarier. Instead of The New Teacher representing an authoritarian government, I see her today as a symbol of an authoritarian religious movement that seeks to insert its own values into the hearts and minds of all. Clavell's warning about the ease with which manipulation can be successful transcends specific antagonists and tells us instead to be wary of any entity that attempts to ursurp our own values and ethics in favor of theirs."
4,A Must Read for parents,"My 6th grade reading teacher read this to me a few years ago. It really made me think about how a child's mind is like a ball of clay, in that it can be molded so easily in a blink of an eye. I don't know a lot about the Cold War, as the other reviews have discussed, but it is a book that makes any parent or young adult think.It makes them think about how children's minds can be brainwashed without their even knowing it. A great discussion topic, too. Buy this book. You'll feel wiser after reading it"
5,GOOD BOOK,A good book written by someone who has done the hard yards. Certainly one of the better dog training books in my library and one that I recommend off my web site. wwwrossallan.com
2,Won't Last Longer than Two Years,"I've noticed a few positive reviews for the MFC5200C, and all I have to say is - we'll talk in a few months and see if you still feel that way.The machine was good for me for several reasons - multi-function, fair print quality (if you don't need photos), and moderate printing speed. However, after 21 months of low volume usage (5 print/copy per day), I got the dreaded ""Machine Error 41"". That is essentially the death dirge (the printer head needs replacing). The repair cost is $164, which when compared to the cost of the machine is a ""no-brainer"" solution -- don't!I've talked to a couple of technicians in my area, and they said that I am not alone in my Brother problem. If you want my opinion about this particular Brother product, I say buy if you have the expectation to replace it every two years. If you are planning on keeping it longer, then go elsewhere."
2,Brother gone bad,"This was a huge disappointment as this unit replaced a great model 9200c. The unit is tinny sound..squeaky belts..most difficult for single sheet feed, due to a rear entry where a compartment must be opened..ends up jamming most of the time. Fax feature is also not very good as it disconnects transmission without reason, then redials. I would not recommend this model"
2,Don't do it,"I have owned this MFC for 2 years and would NEVER purchase another Brother .. ever. I use my printer frequently but each time I use this ""piece"" I have to clean the ink heads or white lines appear in the print. Which of course, the cleaning uses an insane amount of ink.I don't advise this product at all.After 10 years of Home Computers...I have to say I think Epson is the best deal for your money.Thats what I will purchase soon."
1,"Brother's ongoing printhead problems, bad printer, bad services","I own a MFC 5200C. I replaced the print heads in the 5200C last months (2006) after approx 3 months and now today my 5200C has the dreaded ERROR 41 message. I called Brother, their advice, you need new print heads again. I realize that the print heads on Brother MFC's are only built to last two years of moderate use. In my opinion dont purchase this printer and save your money making another purchase."
1,Brother's ongoing printhead problems,"I own a MFC 5200C and an MFC 7160C. I replaced the print heads in the 7160C last year (2005) after approx 2 years and now today my 5200C has the dreaded ERROR 41 message. I called Brother, their advice, you need new print heads. After reading many reviews; all stating they had the same problem (and all after approx 2 years of moderate use), I realize that the print heads on Brother MFC's are only built to last two years of moderate use. In my opinion save your money and research well before making your purchase. Spend a few bucks more and buy a better product, its cheaper in the long run."
1,Not worth the money; unreliable,"Follow the advice of the others who purchased from Brother. Don't. It's not worth the money as you'll be replacing print heads and wasting time on the phone w/ ""customer service."" They'll replace it the first time only to have it continually happen. Buy HP. It's more expensive but more reliable. Don't believe me, go here & read on: www.fixyourownprinter.com/forums/inkjet/25785 and www.fixyourownprinter.com/forums/inkjet/23050 and www.fixyourownprinter.com/forums/inkjet/22817Now you've been warned."
1,Never Buy Brother,The print quality is poor. Heads require constant cleaning. Error 41 every 6-18 months renders printer useless until heads are replaced. CANNOT USE OTHER FUNCTIONS WHILE ERROR 41 is in effect.Worst printer I have ever used.
3,Worked fine for little over a year,"I loved this printer, until it was out of warranty and the print head went out. Quoted $200 to replace a Brother print head. Told by the tech that Brother is famous for this."
1,Brother MFC5200C stay far far away,I have had my brother for about 2 years and 6 months ago I had the same problem with the print head as some others have had. It stopped printing magenta so I kept using it as most of what I copy and receive as faxes are black ink now the black is gone. Not worth the money I spent. Aside from this problem the machine has always been slow and I had to clean the heads way to often.
3,Brother 5200C multifunction printer,I bought this printer about a year ago and have been reasonably happy with it. I use it in a home business where i do print alot so it gets alot of use. I hate it that if you run out of one color it wont print black and white until you change the color ink. It prints pretty fast but the ink is really light sometimes. The tray on it broke right away with minimal use also.
1,All Brother's suck,"I am a printer repair tech. I just stumbled across this reveiw on a search for brother printheads. Brother's work fine untill the printheads clog up. Then it will cost more than the value of the printer to replace. My suggestion is to buy an HP product. Like every printer manufacturer HP makes some cheap printers, but at least they also make some good ones unlike Brother. When shopping for a printer just remember, what you pay for is what you get"
3,"5 stars for Terry Pratchett, zero stars for this Kindle edition","I am a long time fan of Terry Pratchett. I'm currently re-reading the entire Discworld series using the Kindle application on my phone.This particular Kindle edition does not do Mr. Pratchett's story telling justice. The typos, missing quotation marks, and missing line feeds distract horribly from the story.I've read 25 Kindle editions of Mr. Pratchett's books, and this is the first one I've encountered whose editing/proof-reading is so bad it is egregious.Whoever transferred this book to the electronic format should not be allowed to transfer anything ever again."
4,More one-liners than a room full of... One-liners.,"I can still vividly picture a guy being thrown ON to the river... Terry perfectly illustrates what the world would look like if it were much more fun. Death-of-Rats with his little rat-scythe. A wizard with a leather jacket bearing the words ""Born to Rune"" on the back. Rock and Roll sneaking in a few hundred years before its time. As soon as I can find a bus going there, I'm buying a ticket."
2,Disappointing,"A rock 'n' roll story evolving around - well, rocks that roll... Neat idea, but I found the book somewhat boring. Although I'm a BIG fan of Death's and Susan's, I couldn't get a hang of the story. There are simply better Discworld novels than this one!!"
2,Kindle Edition is Awful,"I have nothing bad to say about the book itself. However, the Kindle Edition of this book is full of errors, most of which appear the be the result of a bad OCR transcription which the publisher didn't bother to proofread. It contains things like ""pointy fiat"" (should be ""pointy hat"") and ""har.d"" (should be ""hand""). Proper names are routinely butchered. ""Jade"" becomes ""Lade"" or ""fade"". Commas become periods and vice versa (especially in sections done in Death's voice). Some of the footnotes appear to be mismatched. And to top it all off, there are a few sections that actually appear out of order. (did the pages get mixed up as it was going through the scanner?) HarperCollins should be embarrassed for trying to sell such a shoddy e-book."
3,"Not one of his best, odd formatting","For some reason they changed the formatting of Death's dialog from previous Discworld books, even though it's the same publisher. It used to be printed in a small caps font that fit in well with the rest of the book, now it is big ALL CAPS formatting that jumps out of the page and is a little overwhelming.This is the 8th or 9th Discworld book I've read and the others were better, the characters were more developed."
3,A little disappointing,"A little disappointingSOUL MUSIC introduces the reader to Death's grandaughgter Susan (Maybe Pratchett saw Mort as a losing proposition as I did) and gives her chance to step into the family business as Grandad's gone missing again and she's called into duty. While there are a lot of clever bits here (I particularly like the Death of Rats a wickedly funny idea) and Susan is a nice addition to Discworld, this is another example of Death takes a holiday that I found to be a bit tired. I also wasn't enamored with the birth of rock and roll in Discworld which just seemed a bit lame in execution. Pratchett is always a fun read but I didn't find this up to his usual standards."
4,Born to Rune,"Oh boy.Ok firstly, I DID enjoy reading it and I did laugh.However, there were too many characters who weren't essential to the story, so I feel that the characters that were essential did not get more air time and more depth. I really liked the bard character and wish we could have got to know him better.I think more concentration on his story could have leant a more philosophical blow to the story - I may have even cried for him had I cared more. Oh well, small details."
4,A fairly average Discworld book,"If you've read any of Terry Pratchett's other books, you know pretty much what to expect from this one. Most of his books are built around a satire of something, and as you have most likely figured out, this one is primarily about rock music. The more you know about music, the more of these jokes you are likely to get. There are plenty of good jokes here, as there are in most Discworld books, but there are also some dull sections, and the conclusion is a bit weak. If you haven't read any Pratchett, don't start here. This isn't his strongest effort, and it is a sequel to Mort. If you are already a Discworld fan, you won't be blown away, but you'll find that it's as good as most of his books."
4,"Not the best, but still good","This isn't my favorite of the Discworld series, but it's still a solid read, and a very funny take on the world of rock and roll. (Or rather, the world of Rocks that Roll.) Another in the Death series, not quite as wonderful as ""Reaper Man,"" but worth a look if you're a fan. Or even if you aren't; because, let's face it, Pratchett is still a cut above the rest, even in his more minor efforts."
5,Rockin' Real Rolls Over,"It hardly gets any funnier than this: DEATH (skeleton in black robe) has a teenage granddaughter named SUSAN who gets a crush on a young musician Imp y Celyn (which translates Celyn = Holly, Imp = Bud). Ructions in reality ensue when Susan tries to save Buddy from his appointment with Fate.If there is a musical catchphrase that Pratchett fails to warp, pun or riff off of, than it isn't an important one. Pratchett's characters are lively and engaging; his plot runs on rockets and his humor, whether you find it satiric or merely slapstick, is truly funny. As always, Discworld holds up a warped mirror to our world and shows a true picture. This is one of Pratchett's best. Highly recommended."
1,"If this is his best, the others should be burnt","I was told that this was his best. Perhaps this is true, but I will not be wasting my time reading any of the others. ""Cult"" writers are often over-rated, yet I cannot understand why apparently intelligent people want to read this trash. Most science fantasy is terrible. Even Tolkien was much more enjoyable when I was 9. ""The Silmarillion"" is shockingly bad at any age. The only joke I laughed at (and not out loud) was the one about Thelonius Monk. Also, I think that Susan's character has definite paedophile connotations, and is generally implausible. Watch some bad TV instead and save your money."
5,One of THE BEST books ever written!,"This is a great story of Susan Sto Helit who finds out her grandfather is Death to the Discworld! Soul Music is a fantastic and hilarious book that has all the elements of the preceding Discworld titles, but oh so much more. Everything you could ask for. . . action, comedy, romance, horror, and Music with Rocks In. My advice: READ IT! I loved this book and I'm sure you will too"
5,Weird and wicked.,"This book is full of so many puns and jokes its downright scary. The many plays on pop culture, such as 'We're on a mission from Glod.' to a raven named Quoth, this book is probaly one of the best satires there is. Oh and there's somthing about Death"
3,Soul Music,"While I enjoyed reading this book, I didn't feel that it was as good as the other Discworld books. I love seeing Death's human side, so to speak, and I loved the character of Susan. Something felt lacking in this one. I couldn't really care for Buddy. Still worth reading, though."
1,once again great job pratchett horrible job harper collins,"I stopped counting typos after 50, that's not hyperbole I literally counted and bookmarked all the misspellings up to fifty(less than quarter-way through the book) before giving up, not just misspelled words either about halfway through several pages are out of order, and that's in addition to the standard shoddy formatting we've all come to know and love harper collins ebooks for. I got my money back and I recommend you don't waste your's."
3,Book was a little disjointed but very fun,There were a couple of subplots in this one and they didn't marry as smoothly as other Pratchett novels have but it was still a very fun and enjoyable read.
4,Spinal Tap should sue,"Discworld is a highly entertaining mickey take on the most ridiculous industry known to man. No corner escapes Terry Pratchett's wicked humour:performers, managers, agents and especially the fans (the image of the Dean in his leather cloak with the words ""Born To Rune"" on the back still makes me chuckle). Well done Mr. Pratchett! Long Live Music With Rocks In!!!"
3,Cute but I am TINY!!,"This item is very cute and I loved the way it looked online, but it is SO SMALL!! It looks like the picture on a pea-sized scale. I was dissappointed and had to send it back. I only paid $49 and it still felt like too much."
5,The best book for children and adults,"I can say this is one of the best books I have ever read when it comes to injecting social and moral values which people of all ages need today. The two angels came down to earth and saw the ugliness of earth. The had done marvelous miracles, helping young people cope up with their problems. The book also showed the different problems the world is having--wars, famine, fires,discrimination and crimes. At the same time it showed that there is a greater power that can conquer the evils and vices that confront everyone of us. The book has the cutest and most interesting situations making me continue reading the book eagerly up to the end which challenged my mind and made me pause for a while to capture what the author meant and wanted to demonstrate. I recommend this book for everybody's reading pleasure. This is a real wonderful book that kids and even the old will enjoy reading from beginning to end."
3,Response to Veena Shekar,"In response to Veena Shekar's comments about the Sibi mural on the cover of my book, all the information I have ever seen or been told about this mural is that it portrays Haidar Ali and Tipu Sultan. Before commenting, perhaps she should have read the book."
3,Comment on the cover page,"To the author, This is not a review of the book but just a comment on the cover page which is very important. I have not read the book so I will not pass any comments on it.The photograph which you have used for the cover is unfortunately not appropiate as it does not belong to Tipu Sultan. The picture is a mural found on the walls of a temple in Sibi, Karnataka. The person seated in front of Krishna Raja Wodeyar is Karnik Nallappa who was in the service of Tipu and Wodeyar and not Tipu Sultan himself. I am the author of a book on the paintings of Sibi so the information given is authentic. I will be happy if the author wishes to get in touch with me."
4,Pretty Good Book,"Don't let the cover of this book fool you. I know it looks like a ""fluff bunny"" book, but it's not. She gives you a good history, visualizations, and pretty of excellent ways to celebrate the sabbats. The spells are good, but some of the stuff may be hard to acquire if you don't live near a new age shop. But it is a good book."
2,Often Bogus,"Chubby ex-security guard ""ANIMAL"" (more than likely a nickname he gave himself) gives lots of advice on wacky karate techniques. The pictures of him and his skinny Dungeons and Dragons nerd friend performing outlandish ""wing chun"" moves, replete with too-tight jeans and knives on his oversized belt, are worth the price of the book, however."
4,Great dang book,"This book is awesome, it's got no BS that you might find elsewhere, and it's very practical even for just an average guy (like me) who just wants to protect and defend what's his. I recommend it for anyone interested in getting smarter aboout real fighting and what's what. The author doesn't talk down to you with a bunch of nonsense, you're always more or less on his level. He's the best guy to be taking combat/survival advice from that I've come across, at least."
2,Be aware of your surroundings,"""Be aware of your surroundings"" sums up most of the useful information in the book. As in his other works, there was some useful insight into the ""street psyche"" of would be toughs. Also, he reminds us that there are people who are ready, willing and able to do you harm. Once again, ""BE AWARE.""I have a difficult time believing all of the author's stories. They just seem like the type of macho krap (although he warns of the macho mentality) you might hear from some barfly before someone gets tired of it and calls his bluff.Overall, it is not as useful as some of his other books. If I had it to do over again, I would probably save my money."
3,More a book on common sense than fighting,"Although Mr. MacYoung does offer a lot of advice about streetfighting, the heart of his book is really about how you can avoid dangerous situations entirely. Much of this is common sense, gut instinct kind of stuff -- which of course most people ignore! 95% of bad situations can probably be avoided. As for the remaining 5%, he has good advice for the dojo trained: there's a BIG difference between the dojo and the street. It's the difference between fighting and combat. If you're not bothered by the author's frequent salty and street language, this is an entertaining book that is practical and informative."
4,"Very good book by ""Animal""","Well,Senshido instructor Richard Dimitri speaks highly of Marc ""Animal"" MacYoung's books, and like always, Rich is right.Animal's books contain excellent tips about how to detect violence and deal with it effectively using no nononsense techniques.Marc talks about many important things in his book, such as the importance of awareness, the difference between a striker and a maimer, real stories that either happened to him or to acquaintances regarding violence, among other things.If you're into Real world self defense, not flashy Martial Arts, get this book, and others by this author. I know I will.I highly recommend getting ""In Total Defense Of The Self"", by Richard Dimitri. It just takes your training to the next dimension and enhances your survivability a hundredfold"
1,Give me something I can use...,"This book is great if you just retired and want to start a small hobbie farm and you have lots of money to spend, because that is what the Government wants you to do in this book. I think they really need to retitle this book because it is not fitting! It offers nothing of value if you really want to make a go at trying to live on a small scale farm and be self-suffient. They keep pointing you to buy this or spend money here to do that. But if your really trying to live off a small scale piece of land I would recommend Joel Salatin ""You Can Farm.""Good luck to you if you are going to try and do this!"
4,Good resource,this is a good resource if you are thinking about living on land. It makes you consider practical issues.
4,Mysterious,I am 15 years old. I wanted to read this book because the story sounded like a good book. And I was right. It was a real page turner. I gave it 4 stars because it was a school project and I didn't get the chance to finish the book.
3,I can't agree with the other reviews ***SPOILERS***,"First of all, I never got to like the main character - Laura / Marta. She's a great mother but not all that likeable to other people. Once I found out what she had done in Florida, that was it. I felt no empathy for her whatsoever.I'm still not clear on why Marta felt she had to resort to prostitution as a teenager. Was it for the money only? Was it because of her mother? Was it because of her stepfather? This was never fully explained.And, with everything that happened with Laura and David while going through their crisis and what is going on with Laura regarding work once her secrets are out, there was no ending! What happened? The author could have at least done a few 'epilogue' pages to wrap up the story lines.Sorry, but I was disappointed."
5,Excellent!,I sent this book to my 4 yr old niece just before she went to have her tonsils removed. It really helped her without scaring her. She even brought it to the hospital so her parents could read it to her again! Perfect for this age group!
3,Not very relevant today,We bought this book for our five year old who needed a tonsillectomy. After pre-reading through it once we decided it best to not even show her the book because modern tonsillectomies are pretty much always out-patient. I can see how it would be very helpful for kids who will have an in-patient procedure but it covers a lot of things that didn't apply to our daughter and would possibly given her much more to be nervous about.I'd love to see a modern version more targeted at out-patient procedures that covers things like anesthesia and IVs.
2,just okay,"this book is just okay. my son knows the sesame street characters but honestly lost interest very quickly in this book. i feel it is outdated. if you are looking for a book to prepare your child for a hospital stay or surgery i highly recommend ""Franklin Goes to the Hospital"" it is well written and a very sweet story line."
3,A little advanced.,"Our 2 year old is having surgery this summer, so we were looking for books to help her understand. This book was a bit beyond her attention span. That being said, I wish it were still in print. I think it's definitely worthwhile."
1,no evidence,"Good historical stuff, but Metzger is full of generalizations which he just pulls out of his head. No evidence whatsover!His premise is that the Byzantine text is flawed. He then goes on to accuse the scribes which copied the Byzantine text of altering the text on a constant and regular basis. No evidence is given for these accusations other than they altered the text to make it conform to their beliefs or to make certain narratives more alike. Prove it Mr. Metzger.The manuscripts for the Critical Text of which Mr. Metzger is so fond was found in Egypt. Wake up boys and girls, that's where the Gnostic heretics lived. They had access to the egyptian manuscripts and were far more likely to alter them than a christian scribe who believed he was copying the actual words of Jesus or the apostles.The Byzantine church kept to the original teachings of Jesus and the apostles far longer than any other group. Let's give them the credit they are due."
3,Lacks Objectivity - Good for Studying Liberal Theory,"Contains substantial duplicity of standards. Criticizes Wescott/Hort and others for strong bias for/against certain text types, yet he himself can hardly mention the Byzantine text without making some kind of deprecating remark. Castigates selected textual critics for subjectivism and ""internal considerations,"" while asserting that textual criticism is less like science and more like poetry (p211), or a dog hunting fleas (p219). Fair amount of specific examples, but tends to be somewhat one-sided in interpreting some of those examples."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"The Osborn family is fruitloopy enough to fill a pallet of breakfast cereal.Mary Jane Watson is not the sharpest knife in the drawer. When a superhero gives you personal safety advice, it is a good idea to listen.Hobgoblin gets taken down by Nick Fury and a hulkbuster unit, which makes sense to me, because both he and the Green Goblin in the Ultimate universe look pretty much Abominationish."
5,Awesome game,"This game is simply awesome. You can combine all sorts of characters to be on a team, and with extensive touch screen usage, you can use all sorts of sweet moves. A special bonus is that you get to use a few Final Fantasy characters in the mix, which give the game a special twist. This game definately deserves 5 stars!"
5,good game,"i bought this from amazon,for my son and he is having good time.i am very much pleased with amazon timely service.5 stars for both game and amazon from me."
1,I did't hate it.,It was the wrong version. I needed the Wii version. It was the wrong version. I needed the Wii version
5,Matt's Mario Hoops Review,I am 7 years old and I love this video game. It is challenging in all sorts of ways. I like to do special shots as Yoshi. I would recommend this video game to any kids who like basketball and Mario games. There are different kinds of courts when you get better at the game. There are different players when you get to a different tournaments. Enjoy the game!
2,"Fun game, bad multiplayer","This really is a fun game. The stylus controls can detect a wrong movement now and then, but it isn't anything to make you stop playing the game.The big problem that I have with the game is that in order to play a game of basketball with a friend you must BOTH have the game cart. I could understand that if it was over the internet (which this game doesn't support), but for local wireless this is a deal breaker."
2,"Eh, not horrible.","I was hoping for this Mario sports title to be as good as others in the past. It isn't. Its gameplay hinges on using the stylus for everything except moving. That's never good.To dribble the ball, you have to continually tap the screen, which gets annoying after too long. You also have to memorize which way to swipe the stylus to make any shot, so if you're like me, you'll just memorize one shot and keep using it till it goes out of style.You pick three of your favorite characters to be on your team and face off 'tourney-style' against 3 other groups. That's kinda nice, but unlike Mario tennis or the other Mario sports games, your computer team mates cannot interact with the ball. You have to press the 'L' or 'R' button to switch to different members, and then control them to pick up the ball. Again, this gets really old really quick.All in all, I didn't find it much fun. Maybe I'm in the minority, but I can't really recommend this to anyone."
4,"Pretty good, but...","This is a pretty fun game, yeah, but it is definitely flawed in some areas. The controls, for instance, are definitely not top-notch. The difficulty gets ridiculous. And... Well, yeah, that's about it. Oh! And some of the unlockables are near-impossible to unlock because of the difficulty. It is a fun game for the most part, but those flaws just take away from the experience. If you really like Mario Sports games then definitely buy it, if you just like sports games in general then you'd probably have a 50/50 shot at liking this. I like it, but I'm a Mario fan. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
2,Best if you Borrowed/Rented,"I walk in the store and i had a choice between two DS games: Mario vs. DK 2, or Mario B-Ball 3on3, and frankly, i think i made the wrong choice. dont get me wrong, all my favorite nintendo characters are here and dunking like pros. but the controls get annoying real quick and the 'collecting coins' concept kills the game even quicker. i tried, and i mean TRIED to like this game and play a game or two while i was in the b-room doin a number two. but it actually helped me get out quicker. the graphics push the DS further than ever before and thats a bout it. do yourself a favor, wait at least til this becomes a best seller for the price drop. becuase for $10 more i would've just gottin NBA2k7 or something.*NOTE* i dont blame nintendo for this game since they didnt make it, they only contributed the characters. SQUARE ENIX should stick to what they do best, Final Fantasy RPG's and thats it. and would it hurt them to put in a few more square characters that actually mattered?"
3,"FUN, BUT IT DOESN'T LAST FOREVER.","Reviewer:Adriel RahmanThis game is very fun as soon as you pick it up but after a while, it gets repetitive. Your teamates know nothing about basketball. They don't help you out in any way. You are the one who has to do everything. So when you play against tougher teams, they will knock you into the year 3000. Also the controls don't always work properly. After you beat single player theres onlymultiplayer to look foward to. If this didn't have single card multiplayer this would get a very low rating.GRAPHICS - 10/10SOUND - 7/10GAMEPLAY - 6/10CONTROL - 6/10OVERALL - 6.8/10Its better to borrow it from a friend. This game is worth 20 bucks not 30.Too bad nintendo couldn't put lots of minigames and game modes like tennisand Super Smash Bros Melee. Its just too repetitive"
2,Frustrating.,"This game has its moments but it doesn't go far beyond that. With a frustrating AI, its hard to enjoy this game on the harder difficulties. I've been playing this game for a couple of weeks now and its a lot of fun. Unfortunately, that fun has been squashed by its frustratingly hard AI opponents.Pros: Great GraphicsPretty good musicFun ConceptCons: Useless AI teammates (they won't pick up the ball if its right next to them.Amazingly difficult AI in the final stages. (how do they just appear out of no where!)"
1,"Garbage, not in very good shape at all!","If not handled just right it would fall apart. The pages are too small. Hard to read. It does have the whole story, with enough information on how to assemble a balsa raft."
4,Great cable,"Love it, works great, good length for the price. Looks mean and the thumbscrews are the perfect length(I've had a few cables that were a tad short for my monitor). I bought it because I needed a cable longer than 6 feet after moving my tower around, was not expecting the quality I got. Will buy another when I get another display.Side note: I'm not sure who added a sound quality rating to a DVI cable..."
5,WOW!,"LOL! This is weird. At this price? And the quality you get? This is a very good investment. A regular DVI cable from bestbuy will run u more than $20. And it's cheaply made.This product on the other hand, huge ass wire. It's like 0 gauge wire or something. Very big. Well made. The quality is outstanding."
5,"Great for those that want that ""premium"" feel.","My original white cable had the one end like |_ (L) shaped instead of the straight this one is, so it would not fit on my new setup. Don't get me wrong, this cable has that ""premium"" look that I like, but it does nothing more than your standard white DVI cable (and nothing less). Don't buy this thinking you will get better signal, you won't, but it will give you that ""pimp"" look!"
2,ridiculous design,"I'm sure this cable is very high quality, but c'mon design guys, get a brain. I had to take a knife to it in order to get it to fit into the dvi port on my samsung 22"" monitor. The plastic surrounding the metal dvi connector is too wide to fit past the available space on my monitor. Then, my fingers barely had room to turn the tightening screws...it sure would have helped it they hadn't gone for the fancy gold colored screws and had just used a simple plastic tightener that had slots in the ends for a screwdriver like most cable tighteners. Also, as usual with Monster products, hugely overpriced."
1,AWFUL!!,"This cable is stiff, stiff, stiff - very difficult to route in and around other wires and equipment! Worse, the screw connectors are nearly impossible to tighten or loosen on a typical monitor where there is very little clearance - there is no screw slot, and the screw posts are fat and slippery. This was so bad I threw it away."
2,does it really matter?,"it is a cable for transferring digital signal... in the digital world, the smallest bit of information is either 0 or 1. in terms of electricity, it is like, either 0 volt or 5 volt. So unless the cable is so lousy that the device cannot tell 0 volt from 5 volt, in which case a gold or platinum plated digital cable is not going to do any good. it either works or doesn't work. there is no ""in between"".this is similar to DTV or HDTV -- either you get the picture or you don't. If you do, it is going to be prestine. If you don't, then there is no picture at all. Note that in this case, the analog (non-digital) portion of equipment still makes a difference, such as the antenna or the speaker cable that is non-digital.so a [$$$$$] DVI cable shouldn't make any difference than a [$$] one."
4,Good Product But Almost Too Short,Title says it all. Very well made cable but for my need I should have purchased it in the 2 meter length.
5,Great Cable but I cannot use it now!!,"I have a fairly new HDTV system I bought back in January. I have a JVC 56"" rear projection HDTV and am getting my HDTV source from Insight Cable through a Motorola HDTV receiver. I experimented with component video connections when I first bought the TV but later tried the Monster Cable DVI400. Wow what a difference! DVI is the ONLY way to hook up HDTV in my opinion. The colors are brighter and pictures are sharper. Like all Monster Cable products this is made of very high quality materials and it looks nice too. I cannot believe some of the notes I have seen on the internet from people that feel the component video connection is better. The quality of the DVI connection is so superior that my cable company has decided to turn off the DVI output on my cable box. They claim the quality is so good that pirates could make copies of movies through the connection! They claim that this is a new FCC law even!"
3,Warning: This is a Single DVI-D Cable,The quality of the cable seems nice but since this is a a digital cable that does not get converted to analog (DVI-D) then the quality of the cable doesn't really matter over short distances. But more importantly to myself the physical pictures clearly indicate this is a single link cable but the one in the middle picture showing the pin layout is a Dual Link DVI-D cable not to be mistaken with a Single Link DVI-D cable. But rest assured this is a single link cable. Hope this helps someone not make my mistake!
4,Product as Described,"Cables were exactly what I expected. Nice fit and finish. I did have to trim the edges of the plug because I'm using them for dual monitors on an NVidia 9400 card. There is a lip just outside of the screws to attach them, had to cut it off. Image quality is great."
4,monster cable,"Monster is way better than any other cable , quality of the cable that came with my tuner did not even receive picture, so a good cable i just found ot does make a difference,"
1,Very Sensitive Cable,"I purchaced the 4m cable and after 3 weeks it stopped giving mea signal. Just a blank screen. I decided to switch the cable ends and it worked again but I returned it because I did not want it to happpen again. I replaced it with a Monster componet (red, blue,green) cable and the picture is much better. For some reason I always had to adjust the screen size everytime I watched regular T.v. The display on the bottom of the screen would not display on Fox News or CNN. With the componet I get a complete screen and no digital fuzzyness on the top of the screen. I am so much happier with componet cable. If you don't have superman vision then you will find the picture is just as good if not better than DVI. After viewing both I would say Componet is much better!!!!!"
3,Interference,"I have not bought this cable. Thus, the average rating. I am curious though. Would interference from projection TVs, high wattage amplifiers, etc. cause some video dropouts? It seems like you ""Either it works or it doesn't"" people would at least like to protect all those 1s and 0s.Just curious."
3,Old Woody,"Woody as been one of my favorite comedians as a standup, a movie maker and raconteur. I feel this book would be hilarious if the Woodman was reading it to me in person. Apparently this option was not available. So if you can do a good Woody in your head when you read this you will be fine. If you don't know Woody - skip it entirely."
3,"Bad taste, boring stupidity with an occasional funny line","I had hoped upon rereading this work to cancel the original impression I had of many of these pieces when I read them some years ago in 'The New Yorker'. Unfortunately, my taste seems not to have changed and I found most of these pieces stupid, and in bad taste.Allen can write the occasional very funny line but much of this is low- level predictable parody."
5,The Essential Willie Nelson,This CD is excellent; it has a number of my favorite cuts as well as some marvelous duets. Couldn't ask for more!
5,the essential willie nelson,we loved it. we always hate getting cds cause they have live performances and this one does not!! LOVE IT! thank you. vicki
2,How sweet!,"I am really disappointed with most of the cuts in this collection. For example, I had never heard ""Pancho and Lefty"" with violins and chorus. Not the Willie I want to hear."
2,Willie Nelson bored with his own music?,"I haven't made it through the whole CD, but what I have heard is really weak. I am not a die hard Willie Nelson fan, but I have a couple of his CD's and have been to two concerts. I couldn't imagine these overly sweet versions of his recordings. I had a hard time believing that he could sound so bored. In track after track it was as if he were apologizing for his voice using back up singers that didn't fit him or his music."
5,"Simply, Pure Magic","All the best Willy has to offer. From Crazy to Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain, Just like my title..Pure magic."
4,Essential Willie,"I am not a BIG Willie Nelson fan but, I do like some of his music. This album has most of his hits and I put it on my IPOD. Diehard Willie fans probably already have this album and I recommend it."
2,Willie shouldn't try doing jazz,"I am a real fan of Willie Nelson. That's why I bought this album set. I am very dissapointed in the first CD. It seems Willie is trying to change his style. Big mistake. He is so very talented, and when he tries to ""jazz things up"", it becomes tedious and obnoxious almost immediately. However, the second CD in the set is ""our"" Willie Nelson, singing his way into the center of our hearts, as usual."
1,Go Home Willie,"I really dislike Willie Nelson's nasal droning, but my Sister likes it. Got it for her for a gift."
5,Just as described.,"It is a book, what do you want from me? Thanks, it was a book, just as you said. Thanks"
2,quality control 8th edition,"ok book arrived on time, but not so happy about condition though; worse than expected for a ""used good book"""
5,Good piece of gear!,"I ordered this because I love non metallic self defense items. I have purchased items from the Cold Steel line and have used others my wife has also. This one in particular fits my large hands (6'6"") and I would totally be able to submerge this in an attackers neck with no problem. One main reason is the thick quality material and size. It is a great piece of self defense gear that won't set off metal detectors and keep you protected as well. I am all about having the upper hand and this piece of gear will do the job!"
3,Misleading Title,"Except for the title, you cannot find any reference to Diverticulosis in this book. Otherwise, it is a useful book."
2,There is nothing profound here...I was disappointed.,"I bought the book on cassette. A friend of mine who is a college student recently heard the author speak on campus and recommended the book to me. I was very disappointed. A IS FOR ATTITUDE offers nothing profound, and I found it mediocre at best. It seems to be a mixture all of the other motivational books. Save your hard earned money."
4,"amazing, but ...","in the ten years since this was published, there still hasn't been a book (that I know of) published that is better than this one at putting public lands management in an historic-then-contemporary context. it's also nice that it's an edited collection, b/c readers (i.e, students!) don't get lulled into complacent reading by single sytle or approach. highly recommended, though of course, needs to be supplemented with newer readings, particularly dealing with collaborative conservation and political ecology."
2,Difficult to Read Biography of Ivan the Terrible,"This biography of the 16th century Russian Tsar Ivan IV, or Ivan the Terrible is a certainly a well thought out and deep exploration of the life and reign of this eccentric and terrible autocrat.That said, it is a very academic treatment and the organization and prose make it an extremely difficult read for the layperson. I have read a lot of Russian history, including very academic works, and I found this biography a real chore to read and understand. Unless you have a very good background in Russian history, I would not recommend this biography."
2,Written in the style of a textbook,"Don't pick up this volume with the hope of entertaining reading. Only buy this book if you are doing serious research on Ivan or Russia in the time of the first Tsar. While I stuck with it to the finish (I almost never quit a book), it was far more challenging than I bargained for. The author throws around Russian names and terms like her readers are graduate level students in Russian history. I was looking for something in the vein of Peter the Great and ended up with a college textbook."
1,A Big Disappointment.,"I was very enthusiastic about getting to this book. I have a degree in Soviet History and wanted to learn more about this character. Like other reviewers, I just could not get into this book. The writing style was dry as a bone and this chore was left undone. Nice cover but I'd steer clear of this failed attempt to portray a fascinating figure in Russian History."
2,Review of Shattered Voices,It is interesting but very intellectual and difficult to read. Amazon's review of it is not well done so I did not get what I thought I was getting - more of a review of of Reconciliation strategies. It wanders all over the place.
3,It Dies Today,"IDT it's a great band I love them I like their old cd a lot but this one it's still good still good to listen to it and the recording of this album is awesome but in some songs they have that new ""atreyu"" taste and it just doesn't click with me I like Atreyu and all but their latest relase not that good in my opinion but getting back to IDT and that's what makes me give this album 3 stars but there is some brutal songs in this album like track 1,4 and some more but it's average okay not the greatest not the best but def. worth 10 buxs so go get it"
2,nothing special,"They offer up nothing new or special on this release, just an average metalcore album. I bought it after hearing a few songs, and after listening to the album the whole way through, I was quite bored. Wish I hadn't bought it. =("
2,POP CORE!!!,"If this is the new face of metalcore I want nothing to do with it. The breakdowns are brutally heavy, but I can do without the cleanly sung choruses. I give it two stars because the breakdowns were so heavy, and the guitar work was very good, otherwise I would have given it one star. This is extreme pop-fashion-girlie pant-wearing metalcore that the young 'uns listen to...too trendy for me, but a good debut, I guess..."
1,This mother sucks,"Holy Crap, I saw these guys at Ozzfest and they sucked. I havent even heard their album but I'm definitely sure that it sucks. (...)"
5,Heavier Than A Really Heavy Thing,"Yeah, thats a dumb title but, this is a great cd. This is one of the best metalcore/hardcore cd's of all time for me. Others may disagree but thats their opinon. The vocalist is a good growler/screamer and a good singer too. The guitars are very heavy and cool. I think that it is more hardcore than metalcore because there is more breakdowns. The emo-ish vocals aren't very popular with my friends but I think it balances out the record perfectly. You should check this album out if you are into heavy music or just wanting to jump around."
3,nothing to see here,"average cd...i downloaded their first cd cause it wasn't worth buying...but i heard the ""marigold"" demo and thought they had something new to bring to metalcore but they went with punk sounding vocals on the cd and totally ruined a perfect song...all the songs sound the same...i mean, they are talented, but just as talented as the next metalcore band...it all sounds like one long song w/ the marigold punk song intermission and then more of the same metalcore...plus the whole cd is demo quality...i would drop trustkill and sign w/ a major label...and i know every other ""hardcore scenster anti-sellout"" is going to jump me for saying that but there's no point in putting out a cd and not getting optimal sound...if you like metalcore, chances are you already have the cd cause it sounds the same...and why do people keep calling them ITD when it should be IDT?"
4,BETTER THAN NEW ALBUM!!,"This album was awesome! Even though this was released at 2004, this is still good! I would say that they most brutal tracks in this CD are ""Caitiff Choir: Revelations"" and ""The Depravity Waltz"". Which are also my most favorites. But, Nick just doesn't say the words clearer, even when he sings with his clean vocals, he doesn't say the words correctly. I get lost in the lyrics, he ven say things that aren't in the lyrics, and I get so confused. But this still good, ""Caitiff Choir: Defeatism"" and ""Severed Ties Yield Severed Heads"" have very beautiful choruses. But, ""Marigold"" and ""Naenia"" are the least brutal songs in this album."
5,"Don't Listen to Mortuus Intra (Cincinatti, OH)",Don't listen to this viewer he doesn't know what he is talking about. This album is straight grit out of Buffalo. IDT rocks!!!
5,The best wipes I have used....,"These canus baby wipes are the best we have used. We have been using these for over two years now for our little ones. They seem to be more of a high end wipe and with the least amount of diaper rash. One reviewer stated they did not care of the goats milk scent. Of course this is an opinion just like mine, I like the scent. It is an original scent that is smooth and refreshing. When I compare the scent to any other generic baby wipe on the market, these are most natural smelling. Try the goats milk soaps as well, very refreshing...........No I am not afilated with canus products in any way shape or form......CHRIS T"
1,Dissappointed,"Despite other review's description regarding the overwhelming scent of these wipes I decided to try them out - whoa. I was not expecting it to be a strong old-lady perfume. Plus the dispenser (on all 4 packs we tried) barely worked, after 2 or 3 wipes we had to digging into the funk to pull out the next wipe. Also of note, these wipes are not as moist as others we've tried."
2,strong smelling,"these are pretty perfumey, strong smelling. not a smell i particularily like. otherwise they are ok."
3,Was not the original song.,"This CD is OK. but not the original recording. I thought it was when I made the purchase, my mistake."
5,All I Want for Christmas is You/Lisa Layne,This is a must CD for the Holidays. I recommend this CD to one and all.
2,disappointed,The version of the title song she recorded with vince vance is farsuperior to this version.The rest of the cd is just ok
2,Overview,"This book covers the usage of DirectX 9.0. Note, this book is not a cook-book type book where it tells you how to program a game in DirectX 9.0.I would not buy this book again (ie future version/revision)."
3,Interesting,"This collection of essays is insightful but far from comprehensive, a good starting point for further discussion on commodification."
4,handle,they are very ornate and sturdy. I am glad I bought and changed these out for the cheap ones the previous owners left
4,Kwikset Tustin levers-indoor,"We purchased these door handles and latches to replace the 'builder quality' items in our home. The new units were a perfect fit replacement including the doorframe cataches, latch mechanisms, and handle bezels. In fact, they worked better than the units they replaced- much more positive engagement, and handles were solid rather than hollow. It remains to be seen how well the plating will last, but initial impressions are very positive!"
5,Excellent Read,Jackie Collins once again held my undivided attention. She has a way of bringing her characters to life. Vendetta is certainly a page turner. Lucky Rocks!
5,exciting,Jackie Collins does it again! I really love the way that she surprised readers in this book. I really thought that Lenny was dead at first. I almost cried!
4,Another great book about the Santangelo Family,"Like the book so far. I bought it in hardcover at a 2nd hand store. It was soooo big that I never picked it up to read it and refused to travel with it. So, I finally downloaded it to my Kindle and am enjoying reading it on my phone and iPad."
2,Dated and Stupid,"This is one of those 1970's books (ie., Valley of The Dolls) where there is sizzling sex (BORING) and a lame plot. Author's tried to shock in the 70's and readers ate it up because it was so new. Now, in the 90's I like to think we the readers are somewhat more sophisticated. We would like a novel with a clever story, not fill-in sex and gross violence. What a cop-out this book is!! Do not waste your money..........."
5,Discover Denali easy way,"Once you get there, you learn that Alaska is EXPENSIVE, especially mistakes in planning well ahead. As is Denali National Park. And more you know, the better. For those planning a trip to Denali NP a word-of-mouth is probably the best way to go. The book by Dow Scoggins offers a good starting point and a reference for the w.o.m. search. Myself, I bought four guidebooks about Alaska and Denali, three more-or-less useless, rather collections of ads by different operators from the region, and the Scoggins' one. After being there, I can tell you that the book is worth the money."
4,Fundamental Foucault,Foucault's Archeology of Knowledge builds the foundation of Foucault's work. Not an easy read but in my opinion essential in understanding the broader purpose of Foucault's earlier and later works. The work itself stands alone as an original approach to flushing out Truth and power relations. It draws heavily on others work (Nietzsche) but still is very unique (hence a lot of critics/scholars difficulty in attempts at categorizing Foucault).
2,A tough read,"My sympathies to anyone who has to read this. This was something I had attempted to read on recommendation of a professor. Later on in my graduate studies I had to read it. It is a required reading for anyone studying rhetoric. If you can get through it, you are destined for greatness. It is reading that requires intense concentration and no interruptions!"
4,"Informative, but not enough","The book is very good and allows for experimentation, but at the same time, the book is a tad out of date because of the newer technology that has emerged since the writing of the book."
2,NOT FOR AMATURES!!!,"This book is certainly not for amatures. This book was so full of technical mumbo jumbo and wiring diagrams that I thought I needed a degree in electrical enginering to understand. This book is NOT for beginers. The true content of the book is there but it's garbled and hard to, for an amature to understand and I personally have installed a stereo in my own car and was very confused. If you can interpret electrical diagrams and can deal with the lack of color, pictures, common language, clearly defined definition, you may enjoy this book but if you dont then definetly look elsewhere"
5,Excellent cookbook for car stereo installation,"This book provides excellent background info, good design criteria, and photos illustrating similar installations to those discussed in the different sections. I found the book quite helpful."
3,Needs more detail,"Like most books out there it lacks the info everyone is looking for. I could write a book like this without even knowing about the subject and come out with the same thing and make money too. I had to go to different sources to find more info on what he hinted on, really I found more info online crutchfield and caraudiohelp.cometc. Just wish someone could write a good book with all the info without charging hundreds of dollars for it."
3,Old-school book for general knowledge,"This book is a little out of its time,it would be like writing a book about computers when you literally would have to re-publish it every six months. The Haynes car audio Techbook is about the same, outdated."
4,Car Stereo Cookbook - A Must Have Reference Book,"I had a basic knowledge of car stereo before I purchased this book. The book helped me to design and install a multi speaker/multi amp system in my truck. It explained in great detail how to choose your components,especially speakers and speaker boxes. I found it well organized in that the author leaves no stone unturned. There are lots of details which help make your install more professional. The book gives you the tools to create a system that is right for your vehicle. To me this book is well worth the money and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to design/install their own system"
4,Zoop is the Puzzle Game for Puzzle Game Fanatics!,"If you like the prehistoric NES system's old puzzle games-- such as Tetris and Dr. Mario-- then you'll love Zoop! You must shoot different colored shapes to make them disappear. Like Tetris, your score is higher if you ""build up"" and play the game dangerously. We have score competitions in our household, however, like the original Tetris, there is no two-player mode. This game, unlike some newer puzzle games, has no silly storyline, no distracting figures dancing to music, nor confusing landscapes to mess you up. If you are looking for ""cute,"" then Zoop is not for you. If you are a lover of true puzzle games, you'll love Zoop"
5,"Great Stories, talented musicians",Marita Brake has created a wonderful combination of original songs and old standards. Done in a fun carefree way. I love to listen to this CD in the summer. I love the tomatoe song. She has a beautiful voice and is a talented guitar player too. Love it!
3,California explorers meet natives,"In the tradition of Native child meets explorer from another land, Awani is written without sentimentality or ethnocentric bias. It is almost a journalistic report. But not bad. For about 3rd, 4th, low 5th grade. Similar to O'Dell's Island of the Blue Dolphins and Zia or Dorris's Morning Girl."
1,Tin Tan,"This is a movie about a pretend murder that turns into a mess with Tin Tan right in the middle of it.I first watched this movie as child in the 70's but after seeing it again as an adult I only give it one star it does not have the spanglish codeswitching wordplay that Tin Tan is famous for. I recomed it for true Tin Tan fans - only."""
3,Verbose and somewhat entertaining.,Verbose and somewhat entertaining.A reasonably but not very technical book for the lay reader.Can live with or without.
5,"Great Bug deflector, Best price for 05 Scion XB!","I ordered for my 05 Scion XB Very easy to install, looks great.Auto Ventshade 24648 Bugflector II Smoke Colored Stone and Bug Deflector"
5,"""Live At The Top"" 1975","Maynard Ferguson Live At The Top is the better of the many concert films of MF from the 1970's. ""Live At The Forum"", Live At Knott's Berry Farm (The Wagon Camp), and the other scant appearences did not capture MF's raw screaming jazz group as well as this one did. Especially the very young Lyn Nicholson! This one burns!!! especially the cut ""La Fiesta"". The Chameleon band at it's best. Although, I was dissapointed that he didn't release his rare film of the Chameleon band playing Elton John's ""Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me."""
4,Great memento,Great memento to have if you are a Maynard fan since way back in the seventies. Wish more similar DVD's would be produced that included his other performances.
4,POWERFUL,"MAYNARD IS ON TOP OF HIS GAME. WHEN NOT JUMPING ALL OVER THE STAGE ENERGIZING THE BAND AND AUDIENCE HE GRABS HIS HORN AND BLOWS TO THE HIGH HEAVENS. THE TWELVE MEMBERS OF THE BAND REALLY SWING. GOSH, I WISH THOSE DAYS WERE BACK. THE FIRST DAY AFTER RECEIVING THE DVD I PLAYED IT SIX TIMES. THIS IS THE ERA WHEN ( OUTSIDE OF THE BIRDLAND DREAM BAND ) MAYNARD, HIS MUSIC AND BAND WAS AT ITS BEST. AS FAR AS THE DVD, VISUAL IS GOOD AND AUDIO LEAVES A LOT TO BE DESIRED. AUDIO FOR THE FIVE HORN TRUMPET SECTION IS POOR AND YOU HAVE TO LISTEN HARD BECAUSE THE HORNS ARE GREAT. A DEFINITE MUST HAVE FOR ALL MAYNARD FOLLOWERS.I HOPE SOMEONE IS CHECKING THEIR ARCHIVES FOR MORE MAYNARD MATERIAL. WHY NOT A DVD OF HIS CURRENT MUSIC. THE MAN IS AN ICON"
5,I have watched this for years!!!,The reason I can give this a superb review is because I have watched it for years since it's original airing on tv (pbs?) in the USA. I remember exactly where I was sitting as a kid and the way I felt when I saw the show. I cannot rave enough about it. It blew my mind when I heard they were coming out with a DVD because the VHS tape I have is in very poor condition.
5,D'funk; n' nothen but dat diddy.,"This is a compilation of greatest hits from over the last decade, which makes it a nice, if at times incoherent, sampler from one of today's coolest bands. Galactic offers something for everyone: a spice of soul, a touch of rock, and a pinch of acid jazz--only its mixed bourbon street style. So though it may not be for the Jazz-only crowd, it appeals to 'eclectic' funk-rockers. If you enjoy The Dirty Dozen Brass Band, then Galactic is quite a treat."
4,Brutal death/grind from one of the greats,"If you think bands like Mortician, Krisiun, Nile, and Hate Eternal are brutal, you are on crack and you are dreaming. Compared to Blood they are nothing...support the underground; Brutality Reigns Supreme, Circle Of Dead Children, Agathocles, Sexorcist, Intestinal Disgorge, Agoraphobic Nosebleed, Pig Destroyer, Nembrionic, Malignancy, and Dehumanized."
4,LOVE HAVIN' her AROUND,"Melissa Manchester's cd, is one of her good ones. She co-wrote 8 out of 10 songs, was a pianist on all 10 songs. And is one of the best vocalist via Arista records. The melodies are great, the songs are great and WE'VE GOT TIME for some PARTY MUSIC. So let's get going and buy this cd. There's JUST TOO MANY PEOPLE, MIDNIGHT BLUE, STEVIES WONDER, IT'S GONNA BE ALRIGHT, are just a few of the songs. And yes, I want to smother my bad-ass lover with long wet kisses to make him wise, in I GOT EYES. Written by Melissa herself. I cannot say that I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT ANYMORE, and that THIS LADY'S NOT HOME TODAY because she truely was home today. The cd is good. We love havin' her around. An A++++ on a job well done."
3,good for the price,"The movie is fine, musical part is not that great----background is a little bit weak. story is good--hope the story can go a little deeper.over all, it's worth to purchase."
4,Making Friends Anew,"Wanda Sá, Roberto Meneschal and Marcos Valle are three major stars of Bossa Nova since the late 1960's. This is the recording of their 2002 show that I managed to see twice in Rio de Janeiro. It brings them together to sing many of their early hits along with some newer numbers. This ""boutique"" album really showcases these marvelous songs and their talents for a new generation of Bossa Nova fans. Roberto Meneschal generally pairs with Wanda Sá and Marco Valle with new singer Patrícia Alví, whose voice, although very pleasant to listen to, lacks the richness that comes with Wanda Sá's experience.The album is a worthy compilation of their material marred only by the usual live album problems of annoying applause before and after songs."
2,A snore,"I found this play to be extremely dull. There is very little action and the jokes are very dry. The storyline of a man who has had his dreams stepped on his entire life now finally seeing them about to become a reality is marred by the trite stereotypical characterizations. Several of the characters do not add to the story and their presence doesn't even make sense. Further, the story just plain isn't interesting. This is one I would definitely pass on."
5,"Better than ""Stones from the River""","These stories were really wonderful vignettes of characters developed in ""Stones From the River"" (though the latter book was published later, I believe). I selected this book after reading ""Stones"" and ""Salt Dancers"", and liked this one the best of all. Hegi's writing is tight, sparse, and clean in this ""novel"" and Hanna, the teller of the tales, (and the baby to whom Trudi from ""Stones"" was so attached), is a fine observer of the both the strengths and weaknesses of her fellow townspeople - yet she is sympathetic in her recounting of some personal and pivotal time in each person's life. I've wondered whether my enjoyment of this book stems from having met some of these characters from ""Stones"" - but I actually enjoyed this book more. ""Stones"" provided the broad narrative for several decades of history in their little German town while ""Floating in my Mother's Palm"" sheds light on the more personal stories of these characters. Strongly recommend this book"
5,An Absolute Treat,There are few better artists than Hegi when it comes to evoking a sense of longing and hope as she delves deeply into the created characters. I was transported into the lives of these memorable individuals and will forever have a difficult time in leaving them behind. Bravo! I will read any Hegi material I can get my hands on!
2,Floating in My Mother's Palm,Not as good as Stones from the river. I was looking to read more about the community of Bergdorf and the characters as they moved forward in life. Disappointing.
4,Not as good as Stones,Read Stones from the river first and there is just no comparison. 'Floating' is really a set of short stories not a novel and certainly without a connected plot. The stories are quite good as Ms. Hegi again portrays all the follibles of the townsfolk. I preferred 'Stones' for the reason of a plot and 'connectedness' of the story. Also I think that if I had not read 'Stones' first I would have had some difficulty in following the short stories
3,Ok,I liked Stones from the River better. This seems just a bit disjointed to me. Our book club is reading it so I'll finish it.
5,Prose like poetry,"Ursula Hegi is the author of one of my favorite books, A Stone in the River about pre-war Germany and what happened when the Nazis took over. This book takes place after the war. A story about a small town in Germany and everyone's secrets. A collection of vinettes of the different characters in the town. Ursule Hegi has an uncanny way to get into each character's soul and show us through all these different people the thread that connects us all."
3,Neighbor hood gossip,"It was like reading about the neighborhood gossip. I got snippits of gossip about different people in the same town. No full story about one person. The title is the most poetic thing about the book. Easy read. As interesting, cohesive, and informative as the morning newspaper. If you like reading the newspaper, you will like reading this."
3,It's not 10 x 9.6 x 5.2 inches,"It's a very nice product; I love it right after I got it. But it maximum fit 8 inches, I thought it's 9.6 inches, so I have to return it.Product Dimensions: 10 x 9.6 x 5.2 inchesSorry for this,Joanne"
3,"Valuable, but somewhat limited","I was planning my honeymoon & purchased several books including this one. I found that some other books had much more listings. For example, we wanted to stay in the northern part of Kauai, but it only had about three listings. Not to mention, the ones listed were ""expensive to unbelievably expensive and beyond"" as they stated under price. That doesn't really give me a whole lot of choices. I thought a better choice was ""Frommer's Hawaii from $70 per day"" & ""Best Places to stay in Hawaii"". However, I did book one B&B on this books suggestion."
3,Does everything but ...,"I was looking for a ""do everything"" labeler system and this once surely does that and more. It can create bar-codes from your PC and it can even use Avery labels.. If you're looking for something to just do simple labels around the house and for your filing system, then this may be an overkill.... The biggest gripe that I have with this unit, vs. other units by brother which are smaller and have the manual cutter, is that this one wastes by far the greatest amount of tape(per print-out you waste almost 1 inch on the leading and 1.5 inches on the trailing ends of the print-out).....and if you don't have the AC adapter, it wastes a lot of batteries..... So unless you need all of the features this unit has to offer and you think you'll absolutely have a need for the extra features in the ""near"" future, then I would recommend a $25 labeler from Brother..."
5,The Evoka Project ROCKS!!!!!,I can't explain how great this CD is!! The Evoka Project is rapidly climbing my favorite bands list...the songs are great and the band members are awesome - I LOVE THEM! This CD is a MUST HAVE!!!! They are going to be huge soon - I just know it!

5,Description was right on!,I just needed a reference book at home because my last dictionary got damaged in my move. This was the same Random House I had before.
2,Be careful,"If you are looking for Os Novos Baianos, be careful, because they are not !Some kind of a comic Brazilian group, not too bad but less than mediocre."
5,An anthology of writings concerning cinema theory,"Essential Deren is an anthology of writings concerning cinema theory by acclaimed filmmaker Maya Deren. From the poetics of ""Cinema as an Art Form"" to tips on ""Creative Cutting"" to scrutiny of fims in medias res and much more, Essential Deren is a treasury of insight reflecting a life and a professional career dedicated to the highest potential of expression movies can bring. Appendices present Deren's articles in the ""Village Voice"" as well as manifestoes and program notes; a bibliography, filmography, and list of resources points the reader toward more useful and fascinating discussion of the film as trade and medium. Especially recommended reading for cinematography students, connoisseurs and critics, and college libraries and references shelves."
3,"Love DEREN, just not an easy read...","I love what Maya Deren has to say about film and its medium. This is a classic look at our ever beloved art, from (unfortunately), a very technical way. I believe that the most profound things can be said, most effectively, in a very simple way. She wrote probably like she thought and spoke...I just have to re-read most of it in order to understand it. Anyhow, will take me another year to finish, however, I'm determined to finish it, page-by-page."
2,Careful!,"This book is very exciting, taking a tried and true real estate investment technique ('subject-to' purchase) and adding a twist that supposedly makes the exit strategy (what would otherwise be known as a 'sandwich lease-option') safer than the traditional method for everyone concerned.Further investigation, though, indicates the practitioner should be very careful in following these recommendations. For one thing, the argument is used that the land-trust technique touted by the author's real estate services company prevents the mortgage-holder from exercising a due-on-sale clause. Cleverly backed up by a partial citation of a federal regulation, but not true.This technique may indeed be valuable, may indeed make everyone feel safer, but the central premise is faulty. I recommend Mark Kohler's 'Lawyers are Liars' as a balance to this book."
3,Mediocre,"Now, you may have heard that this is one of the all time great Troma films. Although this is probably the best low-budget sci-fi film ever made, it can't hold a candle to ""Dog Years"",""The Toxic Avenger"", ""Buttcrack"", or ""Terror Firmer"". Personally, I was dissappointed, but if you want to see every well-known Troma film ever made, it's worth checking out. But I would purchase this after getting MUCH better flicks from Troma, such as ""Combat Shock"", ""Mother's Day"", and ""Rabid Grannies"".The plot is that four prisoners are trying to get off a prison planet by finding Purple Fleck. There was never a Star Worms I or III."
5,"Great, easy read",This little book is packed with so many great stories. Practicing medicine in 1925 was a bit different than today. Medical school was $130 per semester. Office visits $1 to $3 and house calls were the norm. Should be required reading for new doctors in this age modern age of medicine!
4,"looks great, quality not the best","While the finished product looks great, it did take a bit of extra work. A cracked piece of wood, missing bolt, and several stripped screws were part of the assembly process. Fortunately I had a bit of carpentry experience and a few extra screws so I was able to get it right. However; if your not the handy type you might end up a little frustrated. Based on looks and functionality I'd give it a 5, but the quality is slightly lacking. Maybe I just got an unlucky box, it is a good little cart."
5,worlds largest dungeon,Really good book at good price. Not available in UK.mY SON THINKS IT IS WONDERFUL
2,World's Largest Collection of Typos!,"Quite disappointing that such a massive effort should, ultimately, be crippled by an apparently oblivious attitude regarding proof-reading! Wading through the dungeon, itself, is a massive undertaking, forcing the reader to do the publisher's job too is simply asking too much.The uncountable minor errors will plague the hapless reader throughout the tome, and major gaffs will have more attentive readers scratching their heads (changing the name of the Goddess in Region C halfway through the Region).Unless you have a high tolerance for incompetence, I recommend that you stay far away from this goof-fest!"
2,WLD - Not for everyone,"This book should be marketed to GMs who love to kill off party members. Good tactics and specialized characters can only go so far. We have played 4 games so far and killed off 4 characters. It hasn't been bad tactics that doomed those PCs either.The party is just about always the underdog as the enemy isn't affected by terrain, lighting, poison, etc. There really isn't much in these rooms as far as useful items goes. A lot of the same square rooms and hallways as we try different ways to speed up mapmaking."
4,Empty rooms? No treasure? Heavy DM modification?,"After I read a lot of these reviews I noticed a lot of people have said that there are Empty rooms? No treasure? Heavy DM modification? Really? It's a Prison! To judge a book because it lacks these three items is just wrong. As far as plot goes there is plenty! The basic's, a prison had an earthquake that cracked the walls. Deep Dwarfs came in and dug under a lake. Gosh what a shocker it fell into the prison! An aftershock caused a whole forest to fall 600ft into the prison, and the 2 titan's guarding the front and back were killed by giants and treasure seekers. Typo's its 840pgs and 6 lb so reprints were kind of hard on the check book. So build a knife, get a stick of wood (club) or play as a group of adventures that got sent to Ah, prison (Duh). Wow I found a spear next level I will Weapon Focus. Judging a product because it's a prison with no slot machines or a deck of many things is sad."
2,And the party enters another empty room.,"This book is certainly large, and with all of the maps, a value, but a GM will need to modify it heavily to suit his campaign in order to make it useful.As other reviews have stated, there is not a lot of variety and it can get just plain after you have played a level or two."
5,BEST SHOW EVER!!!!,"If you love the HEF and love watching 3 blondes actually prove to the world that they are not just dumb bimbos, then this dvd is for you. Holly, Bridget and Kendra all have different personalities that will make you feel like their best friend. It's hysterical to watch and of course it's playboy so there's other ""feelings"" there to. But being a female I watch this because I feel that no matter where you live, every female still has the same drama in their life as you. Except I don't live in a mansion or have a boyfriend that is over 80. But you do feel close to them in the end. I love watching this show and so should you."
4,I heard loose pieces in the package...,"This show is excellent. I have no complaints in that department! However, when I received the shipment, I could hear loose pieces rattling around inside the DVD case. The plastic brackets used to keep the DVDs in place were crushed/broken. My DVDs still have a place to go, but it isn't in good condition. Luckily, none of the DVDs were scratched."
3,ANOTHER FANTASY,I MIGHT BE FEMALE BUT THE BEAUTY OF THIS GIRLS AND THEY AMBITIONS KEEPS ME ADDICTED TO THE SERIES.I AM A HUGH FAN OF HOLLY AND I FEEL SHE IS GOING TO BECOME SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO THE PLAYBOY MAGAZINE.
2,needs the polish of the studio,"OK, right up front, I'm a middle-aged (white) dad who only likes some hip-hop. That said, I discovered LB's ""Same !@#$ Different Day"" CD and love it. It is a great mix of new hip-hop and old 70's soul. BUT, I have to say that this live disk was a disappointment for me. For my taste, rap is best after it undergoes the TLC from the studio magicians mastering the sound boards."
1,eBook restricted use disappointing,"Each copy of the book comes with a eBook download code that allows the book owner to download an electronic copy of the book. The eBook version of the book is a special pdf file that can only be viewed on the computer that downloaded the eBook. The pdf file may be copied to another computer but the file will not be viewable on the other computer due to digital rights management features built into the file. Also, there is a 10 page/day print limit on the file. So if you want to avoid carrying the 3 inch thick book around, you had better download the eBook version to a laptop."
3,Wrong Item,I thought this was a DVD not a CD. I didn't know that this very wonderful play was not in DVD format. Bummer!
5,Awesome references to the Lord!,"I'm in my high school's marching band, and our director decided to do a few selections from this AWESOME soundtrack- ""Circle of Life"", ""Morning Report"", ""Stampede"", ""He Lives In You"", ""King of Pride Rock/Circle Reprise""- and I was listening to this CD today and God completely filled me with His Spirit because of the awesome lyrics. It's so obvious that this is a Christian storyline- Simba is returning after he's turned away for so long and he finally takes up his responsibilities...just like humans. We take back our responsibilities as disciples of Christ. God bless and enjoy this soundtrack!"
1,Watch,This is not the recording for the Broadway show. It just the interviews with people who worked for it. The CD music is good though.
2,I Can't Believe A Cartoon Won Best Musical!,"Okay, The Lion King winning the Tony Award for Best Musical proves Disney can *buy* anything. I saw the show and aside for the spectacular visuals it was SOOOO STUPID! The movie was MUCH MUCH better. I can't believe the Tony committee would committ such an atrocity and give this show its top honor, when Ragtime is the best musical since Les Miserables and deserved that award!If you want a REAL Broadway musical - get Ragtime. Ragtime won best score/book/and orchestrations...how that doesn't add up to Best musical I'll never know.Stop now- go up to search, type ""Ragtime"" and buy it.The Lion King is a garbage cartoon!"
4,great,"This show has so much energy in it. I saw it last December on Broadway, and I was blown away. The actors have so much energy and dedication. I feel that their spirit is shown through the recordings on this CD, and that it truly shows the greatness of this show."
2,Can't believe it won the GRAMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"OK, I haven't seen TLK on b'way, but I own the CD, and must say it lacks the excitment (from what I've seen) of the staged version. Yes, a disc is just a one-demensional form of viewing it. But look at Chicago, it is a great CD.The songs from the movie do justice to the stage, but who thought of those new songs? Except for Endless Night, they're all TERRIBLE! I'm not one for african, but I have a ""good ear"", and know that the new music doesn't belong on the CD....but it may belong onstage. I just don't know. The CD without the film songs would be a total waste, and abuse to a fine work of art."
5,Magnificent!,This soundtrack is phenomenal! I listen to it on the way to work in the mornings to brighten up my day.
5,Fantastic!,"Many people who have heard the music from the movie The Lion King would be surprised to know how outstanding the Broadway recording is! Using songs from the movie and also new ones, this CD has everything - from cute songs (""The Morning Report"") to African chants (""The Lioness Hunt"") to truly moving pieces (""Endless Night"".) The performers are so incredibly talented, and the music is beautifully written! I haven't yet seen the play, but I am going in just two weeks and I cannot wait!"
3,gift,We saw this musical when we were in California and enjoyed it immensely. Son-in-law wanted tape of the music for a gift.
5,Lion King- Broadway,It came in great time and it was in great condition. I have no complaints at all. Everything was just as it is supposed to be!
5,A Haunting & Glorious Must Have CD,"Beautiful Music and glorious score, you will do yourself a grave injustice if you don't get this CD. ""Culturalize"" yourself with this Cd, and hear the wind and the drums beat!"
3,Why try to improve on perfection?,"I have never been a fan of Disney musicals, preferring the Broadway variety for its better content. However, there were a few that caught my eye. Two of them have now been brought to Broadway. In this case, my question is-why? First of all, Elton John did not write the new songs. Many of them are put down as songs but are really some kind of tribal music which adds atmosphere but is decieving. I thought the additions to Beauty and the Beast were mostly pretty good, especially If I Can't Love Her, but there's no reason not to go with the superior cast in the Disney version. Its just impossible to make Lion King better than it was animated."
2,A good attempt to capture the majesty of an unfortunate hit.,"The Lion King is one of the most undeserving SRO shows seen on Broadway in many years. Its book and its score--as evidenced by this mostly soulless CD--are instantly forgettable. The show's incredible, astounding, and breathtaking (for want of words more capable of expressing its wonders) physical production cannot be reproduced on the disc. If you must see the show, cover your ears. Only die-hard fans of the score from the movie--most songs of which are still included in the stage version--will want this CD."
2,Sorry Rosie!,"I have listened to The Lion King several times throuh, and each time I have picked up something new; too bad it's never good. I would prefer the movie soundtrack any day. Get Ragtime!, This is no good!"
5,The Lion King CD,Would recommend this purchase without reservation.Product received as advertised and am pleased with saidpurchase.
3,Description a little misleading,"I know this says ""CD"", but there is a DVD included as well. I thought the DVD would include actual footage from the play, but it doesn't. The DVD includes only backstage footage. It is a little frustrated having the music from the play, with no video to accompany. I think Disney would do better and lead to less frustration to leave the DVD out of the package."
1,Take away the special effects and you get this recording!,"I recently saw The Lion King on Broadway, and as I sat in my seat I thought to myself ""Disney is trying to buy it's way to Broadway, YES ""The Lion King"" has all these ""great"" special effects BUT the music/story are not comparable to such great Broadway hits as RAGTIME (which should have won the Tony) and such less known musicals as the ""Scarlet Pimpernel"" Don't waste your money go to the video store and rent the movie! It's the same thing!"
1,the lion king,"i was very disappointed in this book...it had been rated with four stars, and ""like new"" and it arrived scribbled in with bent and torn pages...i intended to give it as a gift and was unable to do so...i feel the book was misrepresented."
5,Every minute was enjoyable,I thought that this CD was perfect in every way and better than the soundtrack CD because it even has some tracks that the soundtrack does not. I consider this to be first on my buy list as soon as I can afford it with college and all.
4,Lion King Sound Track,"We saw the Broadway Play and had to have the sound track. Great, fast shipping. thanks"
5,You must read this book before you implement an SFA system.,"After watching many of my clients spend millions of dollars attempting to solve thier SFA needs and fail I came upon this definitive guide. It outlines the elements necessary to make it work from a technological, cultural, and business process perspective. A must read."
3,"Lots of Batting/Pitching Stats, but nothing for fielding.","The stats for pitching and batting are everything you could ask for, but I don't understand why there is absolutely nothing on fielding. It doesn't even list the position that the players play next to their name. Why not?"
4,Hidden Chapter in Irish History Revealed,"Only the English are represented more often in the roll of Victoria Cross winners, yet we Irish have managed to forget our contribution to the defense of the British Empire between 1840 and 1945. However this book makes a valuable contribution to the restoration of this aspect of Irish History. Meticulously researched and logically set out, it is an uncomplicated yet thorough summary of all the Irish winners of Britain's highest military award. Whatever the merits or otherwise of Irishmen fighting Russians, Boers Afghans and Zulus, the Irishmen who won their 'Gongs' after volunteering to fight against the rampant German aggressions of 1914-1918 and 1939-1945 are above reproach. They are Ireland's forgotten heroes."
3,Gentle Soul - self-titled (Sundazed),"Originally released in 1968, as this was the folk rock band's sole effort. Here you get the lp's eleven initial tracks + nine bonus cuts. Tunes that I sort of liked were ""Marcus"", the beautifully played ""Young Man Blue"", ""Love Is Always Real"", ""Reelin'"" and the unknown folk-gem ""Flying Thing"". Obviously, I wasn't too knocked out with this Sundazed title but I thought it was okay. Line-up: Pamela Polland & Rick Stanley - vocals, Ry Cooder & Mike Deasy Sr. - guitars, Bill Plummer - bass, Tony Cohan - tabla, Paul Horn - flute, Larry Knechtel - organ, Ted Michel - cello, Van Dyke Parks - harpsichord and Gayle LaVant - harp. Fans of the Stone Poneys, Mamas & The Papas and the Seekers would likely get more out of this CD reissue than I did."
4,"Excellent Songwriting, Excellent Band, Excellent Album","If you like real songs written by real songwriters and music made by real musicians this is an album to have. A friend sent me ""Maybe in December"" just to check out and I ended up buying the whole album. Worth every penny! Texas-style Americana done up right. If there were justice in our musical world Lost Immigrants would be a much bigger band."
5,Like it!,Really good band...reminds me of Reckless Kelly. Good music to listen to on the road or sitting on the front porch with friends drinking hard or soft lemonade. Recommended.
1,Stay away,Very disappointed in this record. The music is dull and predictable; the musicians don't fare even that well. No more Lost Immigrants for me.
5,40% Zinc,"We found it at a Target store, tried it and fell in love with it. Then our Target stopped carrying it.The caregivers at our daycare loved this so much, they suggested it to all of the other parents.Great ointment, wipes off easily, smells good and really gets rid of the worst diaper rashes in just a day."
4,Better than most diaper creams but not the best,"This diaper cream does work on diaper rash. However, I find the perfume in it to be strong, offensive, and unnecessary. Why, oh why do companies think that baby products need perfume!!I emailed the company about the fragrance and they wrote that it is an essential oil. I have been using essential oils for quite some time and this cream doesn't smell like ANY essential oil that I know. I believe it is a synthetic perfume.This is better than anything you can get at the store but I will go back to Triple Paste, which has no fragrance and works just as well."
2,Not even a second pick.,"alright, when i first heard Roses are Red , it was on a E-card from TrustKill.... and all because i only heard two songs, i thought Roses are Red had a positive Vibe that was coming from their music. The problem is.... is that when you do come to buying the album, you'll soon find out that the rest of the tracks have nothing in the songs to offer to you, and since all the other tracks are not interesting, you soon lose all interest into the songs you did like before.Don't get me wrong, but i believe that Trustkill Records used to be a whole lot better a couple years ago, but now it seems they have lost most of their BEST bands and put in some that just dont seem to divide themselves from all of the other bands in the music industry. and although roses are red are not horrible..... their just not the kind of music to be really deeply into. and because of that i would not recommend this cd..... or at least borrow, or find another way to hear all of the songs before buying it."
4,Great sound but not the most durable construction,You can't beat the features this system has to offer for the price. Also very compact for those that have limited space. Still use it a lot after over 4 years. I do have some occasional issues with the CD tray but nothing that has been permanent or debilitating.
4,Good intro to the exercises,"I used this as part of a directed retreat this year, and very much enjoyed the presentation."
4,NO MORE HAND-MIRROR NEEDED WHEN TRAVELLING,When staying in a hotel I would have to use a hand mirror to see the back of my hair through the blow drying process. I purchased this product and I affixed it to a picture in the bathroom and it worked very well. I highly recommend this to anyone that can't attach anything permanent to a wall.
4,"Great Puzzle, Piece Missing","The picture is great, there's a nice mixture of straightforward sections (fairies, grass, water) and challenging sections (tree, sky, waterfalls). The pieces fit together quite nicely. Unfortunately, there was a piece missing."
2,"This is no ""Uncool""","I have loved Greg's comedy since the first time I heard him do standup on late night shows. I have worn out the Uncool CD and my wife still wears her Uncool T-Shirt. He's a great comedian.However, on this DVD he seems...off. Off color, off-base, off-kilter...just off. Yeah, he swears on Uncool, but it's in the service of the great and varied stories he tells. On this DVD, he spends almost the whole first half of the DVD dropping the F-bomb and talking about anal and regular sex and related tangents. It had moments that were funny, but it was just too long on essentially the same subject, and the F-bomb ratio seemed to be way higher than on ""Uncool"" and it seemed really lazy as a result.I can't recommend this DVD. The second half is much better, but it's just not enough to overcome the tremendously slow first half. It's just not that funny overall. Enjoy Uncool instead."
4,Large size sandals,"They are sturdy, fashionable, and run true-to-size. The price was very reasonable, and I'm very pleased with my purchase"
4,An educational and interesting piece,This book really helped me with my report. I learned so much that i did not know about AIDS and HIV releated diseases. Thanks to Josh and Amy i got an A!
1,spanglish,"I received this Movie in just a couple of days . Watched it last night , it skipped about 4 times during the movie , im so disapointed"
4,Slow but I enjoyed it very much,I always think of Adam Sandler as silly but he has surprised me. 50 First Dates was quite a surprise which I enjoyed sufficiently to purchase the DVD. I then received Spanglish on our Netflix account and again was surprised by the lack of silliness; in fact I thought it had great depth if a bit slow. I just purchased the DVD at Fry's Electronics to add to our collection of our favorite movies.To me the best thing about this movie was how it held to good moral standards in the face of temptation. There were a few really good lines as well and I found the entire movie quite plausible. Even my 15 year old son thought it was good.
1,Has big hams for hands...,"A more hamfisted and subtly misogynistic treatment of race/class relations in modern US one could not hope to find. Very silly, very unnecessary.Interested in hispanic immigration to US? Watch Maria Full of Grace, or the documentary Farmingville, and go from there. Don't touch this with a barge pole."
3,"""3 1/2 stars is good, you can fly under the radar""","Skimming through these reviews, the general consensus seems to be that this film is about culture clash and sacrifice. This is true, but if there is one major theme in this film, it is INSECURITY. The most obvious is Leoni's character. All of her actions stem from her insecure nature. Sandlers character has fears of living up to what he knows he capable of. The housekeeper has concerns about her place as a mother figure, which is clearly illustrated when she tries to keep with Leoni on her run. The grandmother drowns her demons with alcohol and the daughter has issues about her weight thrust upon her by her mother. The only reason Leoni's character is the vilain in this film, is that she is unable to control her low self esteem thus effecting the lives others."
2,Now I know why I don't see Adam Sandler movies,"I thought that this movie would be pretty interesting. The previews for it made it seem like it was funny. I however found it very boring in parts and sort of stupid. The charactors were either over the top or fall asleep dull with very little middle ground. Also the running time was too long, it says it was just a little over 2 hours, but to me it felt like much more."
2,A flop about a wimp and a nonsense issue,"Disappointing. I agree with the professional reviewer on this site who said that Adam Sandler was in over his head in this role. He does poorly in it. Why is he played as such a sap? Why is it that you want to smack him every time he fails to assert himself?I don't buy the multi-cultural nonsense either, the big deal about the Hispanic daughter losing her culture. What kind of issue is that? What kind of moron thought that was a big issue? Oh hell, you don't want to hang out with Anglos, you don't want to go to a prestigious school, you just want to live in the Barrio. Oh give me a break. It's idiocy. A non-issue for dummies.The film is simply a big flop."
1,Totally Unbelievable,"Spanglish is a big boring mess, with terrible performances by Adam Sandler (completely miscast) and Tea Leoni. If this had just been a movie about a Mom from Mexico trying to deal with raising her daughter in the US, it would have been great. The performances by Mother and daughter, Paz Vega and Shelbie Bruce, were excellent.The most unbelievable part of the film was that the audience is supposed to believe that Adam Sandler's character, a chef and restaurant owner in LOS ANGELES, speaks not a word of Spanish! Not a chance in real life. Who do you think is working in the kitchens in these fancy restaurants? Spanish speaking employees."
4,Spanglish,"I think this is a great drama! Adam Sandler does well in a serious role. The dynamics of culture and family relationships were shown very honestly - you could relate to the characters and feel the emotions the characters felt. The movie leaves you feeling sorry for Adam Sandler's character because of his wife's problems. I did feel bad for him in that he was in a difficult marriage with a difficult woman. However, while his wife had an affair - Adam Sandler also seemed to have an emotional affair. I also felt he made it pretty clear he'd be willing to go for an physical affair of his own if given the chance. So in some ways I didn't think he was the ""bigger man"" but this movie will really get you feeling invested in their story."
3,A sweet movie,"Spanglish, I was hoping, would be a great movie but instead it's just sweet. It has it funny parts, by leachman, and it touching parts too. All is in the film. What it lacks is it lags a little too long in some parts."
3,I wanted a Sandler movie and I got a chick flick.,I saw this movie last night. It was a chick flick.His wife was terrible and cheated on him to. The Grandma did a good performance. I had no problem with 50 First Dates and The Wedding Singer but this is not there quality. The movie was really about a Spanish lady who was hired as a work hand. She did a great performance. As did Adam Sandler I wish they would give Adam credit he can do some non comedy movies. He did this along with Punch Drunk Love and 50 First Dates were not typical Sandler Movies. I will do a little rating of the moviesSandler-10 out of 10His Wife-2 out of 10Her Mom-8 out of 10Bernice-4 out of 10Flora-10 out of 10Her Daughter-3 out of 10Story-7 out of 10Entertainment-2 out of 10Directing-9 out of 10Acting-7 out of 10
5,One of My Favorite Movies,"This movie succeeds on many levels. It's a comedy, but it also has a heart of gold and a lot of depth. Adam Sandler reveals his softer side, which was surprisingly satisfying to watch. Paz Vega was the perfect choice for Flor -- and not only because she's stunningly beautiful. The actress was learning English right along with her character, so there was an authenticity to her performance that shone through. And what can I say about the brilliant Tea Leone? She lived up to her repuatation as one of the best physical comediennes since Lucille Ball in this movie. She was just a joy to behold.If you're looking for a typical Adam Sandler movie, this isn't it. But if you want a fun and funny romance with a lot of warmth and heart, you'll love Spanglish."
4,Not that bad,"I expected more humor than romance, but the plot is very realistic. My ESL students could identify themselves with the main character."
4,Really good!,I had to watch this for an English class I ended up loving it! It really makes you think! Glad I watched it.
4,WonderFul and Moving Movie,This is Adam Sandler finest. I enjoyed this movie so much. And the ending while typical is nonetheless moving. Make this part of your DVD library.
2,What is this movie about?,"Aside from the misleading trailers that pitched this film as a comedy, this movie never finds its voice. Is it a wise and knowing comedy? A drama about culture clashes and the crazy things Anglos get hung up over? I'm not sure. The characters give us no clue. Adam Sandler looks lost as the perfect dad/celebrity chef. His motives are never really clear. I think Tea Leoni is a great actress but her performance here is one note and manic. The maid character Flor is so perfect and wise it feels like a stereotype. There is wackiness here and there is drama but the characters are drawn so broadly and the plot is so meandering that it's hard to care."
2,Pretty bad,"I purchased this on someone's advice - to see Cloris Leachman. Turns out she had a very small part. This is a movie strictly for Adam Sandler's diehard fans. Even he's not at his best here. The writing was one cliche after another. Bored, I found myself wondering how much exercise Tea Leoni has to do to get that body."
1,Relentlessly Phony,"Some of the worst acting ever seen on screen. Sandler is totally unbelievable as an adult to whom any responsibilities would be given. Leoni is a frenzied wreck. Each character is a type rather than a person. None is developed. One leaves the movie exceedingly grateful that caricatures such as these (the husband and wife, both of whom are half-witted or addle-pated)do not inhabit one's world.The film is poorly written, execrably acted (except for the Mexican contingent and the banshee's daughter) and directed, wretchedly edited, and a sorry excuse for entertainment. It is totally baffling that anyone would give this morass a positive review. Only the first and last five minutes (featuring the sane mother and daughter) are tolerable."
5,down to earth,"This film was a real treat. My husband and I went to this movie and we were delighted with the high quality of the story itself and the wonderful performances all around.Paz Vega is a single parent raising her daughter while working as a maid for an American family. This is the story of how she does it while managing to keep in her own family values though being in a different culture and a different family and not speaking the language. It's funny and heart warming, a real gem. It's the best movie I've seen since Big Fat Greek Wedding."
4,Surprisingly Good,"I wasn't sure how I'd like this film so I waited for it to come on video before I watched it. I found it rather pleasing and full of little life lessons that anyone could take away. Like that fact that if you don't tend to your marriage, you could find it slipping away and if you don't have enough strength of character, a love affair could occur. And that communication is a vital necessity in families, and without it, life is just one BIG chaotic mess."
4,A Bonita Surprise,"While expecting a fluffy romantic comedy, I was pleasantly surprised to find many layers of substance and real life no-quick-fixes story-telling. This full of heart film is about so much - dreams, expectations, sacrifice, and yes, love - even the honest conditional kind. The acting was superb (and no, that is not Penolope Cruz!), especially by Leoni and Leachman. The honesty and vulnerablity of the characters evokes the ""laughter through tears"" emotion. You'll see a little of yourself in some of the characters, which is why you find yourself cheering on even the misguided ones."
2,sad again... and again...,When would films stop emphasizing on stereotypes and give imported actors an opportunity to show the talent they have? Sad...must watch to understand....
1,Spang-POOF-lish,"The only good thing that made this movie worth sitting through was Adam Sandler and Cloris Leachmen.HORRIBLE. I finished watching the movie and was like ""what? is this it? It was not worth my time."
5,better than expected,"This movie opens a brief window on the life of a hard-working and under-appreciated Mexican immigrant, Flor Moreno. Paz Vega nails this role without overplaying the part. The message is not forced but the ending was painful to watch. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this movie as I am not an Adam Sandler fan. Refreshing to see him in a more serious role. Sarah Steel was a delight as his daughter - we don't want her to ever grow up. Cloris Leachman is a national treasure."
4,Quite Good,"First of all, Spanglish not a manic, goofy, insane comedy like Adam Sandler usually pulls out.It is actually a Romantic Comedy.It is a chick flick in some ways, but actually enjoyable for most guys too, ""unless you are on a Vin Diesel kick.""A pretty good film with good morals and some fun moments."
1,Worst Movie I have Ever Seen,"This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. It wasn't funny, it wasn't romantic, and it wasn't entertaining. I watched it with my girlfriend. She hated it too. The only reason we watched it to the end was that my girlfriend enjoyed watching me squirm uncomfortably while we watched it. This movie made me want to scratch my eyes out."
2,"Not a comedy, ends not tied well.","This movie is advertised as a comedy, and it isn't one. The plot, or the lack of it, is silly. The movie is told from an essay, an essay Flor's daughter writes. I don't see a real point in this movie. The ends aren't tied well, and after the movie is finished, I am left with questions.The script is bad too. One part in the movie, Leoni (who plays the wife of Sandler) hires a woman (Paz) to work in her house when the woman speaks absolutely no English and has a complete language barrier? It makes no sense.Adam Sandler is the big-name in this movie, and I like his movies, though this one isn't one that I enjoyed. If you want to watch a movie that really has no plot, then this one is for you. For the ones who do want an enjoyable movie, skip it."
2,I expect more from Adam,"In general I think Adam Sandler is pretty funny, but this movie is forgettable. So much so, that I checked it out of the library a second time without realizing I'd already seen it. Pretty much a waste of time. Both times."
5,A GREAT Movie!,I first saw this free on netflix online. I had to have this dvd so since I bought it have watched it MANY times over! I like most all AS movies on some level. It shows human relationships in a real and positive light.
2,Meh...,"I don't know...I watched about an hour and a half of this movie and it just never ""caught"" me...it just didn't seem to be going in any type of a direction, it was just blah. I thought it was a bad sign when I was an hour and a half into the movie and 1) didn't really care what the ending was and 2) couldn't even think of a satisfying ending. It was just an okay movie for me, that has little to no rewatchability."
4,Casting perfection; great late-night chick flick...,"I have to admit I really enjoyed this flick. I thought the casting was first rate. Cloris L was hysterical. Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni should have gotten much more recognition for their performances and the girl that played their daughter? Priceless. The story starts out really promising; an anxious type-A woman hires a laid back gorgeous maid who can't speak English (but is more expressive than she'll ever be!). The family reacts in different ways, as does the maid and her daughter. I really wanted more interaction between the two daughters--exploring that aspect would have enriched the storyline quite a bit. This movie could have gone deeper into each relationship, actually. So much is glossed over in favor of the romance between husband and maid. That said, this movie's script is fine and fun. Uneven at times, yes, but entertaining. Like I said, the performances are awesome..even if you have to believe Sandler is a world class chef!"
1,Terrible,"I love Adam Sandler usually. He doesn't have to star in a comedy for me to like him, in fact I was looking forward to seeing him in a drama. But this was so long and so boring and so disappointing. I think he did a fine job, but needs a better movie to be in (and cut his hair)"
3,Watch Flor!,"This movie is worthwhile for the opportunity to watch the Spanish actress Paz Vega as Flor. She is beautiful, and charming, although her character in this movie is a bit predictable. The other main characters I found offensive, but perhaps that is part of the plot.Sandler has a problem completing a sentence. He plays a wimpish character who, as Flor said, acts like a old Mexican housewife. And Leoni's character was too abrasive, abusive, stupid and self-preoccupied to be believed. That she and Sandler and their two children were part of the same family just did not make any sense, either in real life or in fiction.The movie barely had a story line, so without interesting characters there is nothing there. But watch it just to see Paz Vega."
2,Not as good as it gets...,"I was surprised to discover that I really dislike this film. I like James L. Brooks and most of the people involved - including Adam Sandler. The picture starts out good enough - lots of snappy dialogue - but then it takes a wrong turn from which it never recovers: it becomes a tedious, plodding, melodrama. The film seems to go on forever.One of the things that killed the picture for me is that I just didn't like the Paz Vega character. This is disastrous as the movie expects the audience to fall in love with her. I thought she was annoying. I also had a lot of trouble with the ending, which is supposed to be bittersweet and uplifting, but I found it totally false and it left a bad taste in my mouth. Ultimately, the best thing about this movie was the shots of cooking."
1,embarrassing dvd....,"while i found the movie enjoyable, i find it embarrassing and slightly insulting that no spanish language track or subtitles are included in this dvd. not even spanglish ones."
5,simply the best,i've got nothing to say that hasn't already been said this is simply one of the best rock albums ever made. play it til your speakers and your ears bleed
2,back in black a great cd,It is a great cd. It has a great bet to it. The drummer was great. The gutars were bommen.
1,Spit And Trash,"This album is a SPIT. SPIT THESE GOD DAMMITS OUT OF HERE.Trash music too, Heavy metal is trash!!!!! Also, album hasdrugs, violence, liquor, cigarette smoke and more, Brian Johnsonis heck of a spit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Worst album of the 80's."
1,"Foreigner, Metallica, Dire Straits, Joe Satriani, ZZ Top, George Thorogood, and Van Halen are a billion times better!","I really don't get it, Why do people give Foreigner, Metallica, Dire Straits, Van Halen and many others 1 star and give the awful bands like ACDC, The Rolling Stones, U2, The Doors, and Queen 5 stars? That really isn't true. To this album now, it is horrible. The lead singer screams a lot and the words are disturbing ''YOW!!'' BAH IA M BA A A A HA A AK BA CK IN BLA CK."""""" Why do people like this CD so much??? This is the most overrated CD of all time and I think this CD should go die!! If you are considering purchasing this awful s#$t, you should read the 1 star reviewers. SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR A MUCH BETTER CD, GET METALLICA, ZZ TOP, GEORGE THOROGOOD, VAN HALEN, DIRE STRAITS, FOREIGNER, AND JOE SATRIANI AS THEN YOU WILL BE HAPPY. Thanks for listening, For Whom the Bell Tolls"
1,TRASH!,I never liked ACDC. Their music is just the same and sucks. BRIAN JOHNSON is as bad as BON SCOTT who just screams uses makeup and sells drugs. BACK in BLACK is a very lousy album which has the lousiest songs like the TITLE TRACK. DON'T BUY THIS PIECE OF TRASH! GET FOREIGNER'S FOURTH ALBUM INSTED.
1,Music for white trash,Only trailer park trash will give this disaster anything high than one star. This album is too loud and sexist. I like my music a bit on the polished side. That's why I recommend...Scissor Sisters!
4,Brian steps up to the plate,"Brian Johnson had to fill some rather large shoes, but he manages to pull it off. I was the biggest Bon Scott fan, and still am. I never thought Brian would manage to be the Bon we knew and loved. Back in Black captures that High Voltage attitude, and Mr. Johnson's vocals are to be commended. The raw, three-chord hard rock we've always loved is in this album. Angus steals the show, with Malcolm not far behind. The only thing that kept it from a perfect five stars was the lack of Bon, but if you are a new fan or have been with them forever, look this one up!"
5,ac/dc is awesome,im not a big metal fan but back in black is the best metal cd ever made u have 2 get it
5,greatness,Back in Black is the number six highest selling album ever and in my opinion ac dc's greatest hit.
2,Beginning of the End,"Although this is the first full-length with Brian Johnson on vocals, the band had already seemingly reached their musical peak during the Bon Scott era. The 8 releases that followed this album are almost identical in substance, and weigh heavily on the release of the title track from each respective album to keep fans interested. The previous 6 studio releases with Bon contained at least some variation as the tracks progressed through the album. It seemed like producer extraordinaire, Mutt Lange, mastered the tracks for this album to sound polished and radio-ready during the recording process. You can hear similar over-production on titles such as ""Hysteria"" and ""Come on Over."" Stick with the earlier AC/DC releases for true gritty rock n' roll."
3,Long time coming,"What can you say? AC/DC's best album. Arrived in perfect condition. Only thing is, it took almost a month to get it. Well, I was pre-warned. Don't think I'll order from China again."
5,SWITCHED ON AC\DC MAKES ROCK HISTORY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is the band's first album after Bon Scott's Death in Febuary 1979. And it is Brian Johnson's first album thatsthe album that changed AC\DC. They made Back In Black and likea week later it was relased it was a platnium album.And Not only Angus did a good job Brian Johnson Had a great voice on: Hells Bells Shoot To Thrill What Do You Do For Money Honey Givin The Dog A Bone Back In Black You Shock Me All Night Long Have A Drink On Me Shake a Leg and last but not least Rock And Roll Ain't Noise Pulution. So Buy it now becausea week after it was released it was a platnium!!
5,Back In Black? Hell yeah!,"After Bon Scott's death, the future for AC/DC looked pretty grim. However, not listening to what the critics said, they decided to recruit a new singer, Brian Johnson, and give it another try. That ""try"" became one of the staples of true rock n' roll. ""You Shook Me All Night Long"" , the title track, ""Shoot To Thrill"" and ""What Do You Do For Money Honey"" are nothing but classics. If you cannot let loose while listening to this album, you have to be the most uptight person alive. The songs on this album will stay with you for the long haul. Don't forget, ROCK AND ROLL AIN'T NOISE POLLUTION!!!!"
3,"Back In Black At Its Best, Unfortunately","Unfortunately, This is the best version of 'Back in Black' ever released. The DVD side of this disc is nothing more than a PCM stereo version of the album and a 23 minute documentary (not 30 minutes as advertised). There is also a discography but it is easily bested by many of those on-line like www.acdc-discography.com. So much more could have been done with this package, photos, lyrics, a digital version of the paper booklet that comes with the disc. Mind you, this is a review of the package. The music, as everyone knows, is some of the best rock ever written.Don't shell out your hard earned dollars for a sub par product. Keep downloading until the music studios get a clue an offer a product that is both loaded with high quality content and offered at a fair price. Consumers deserve value."
3,some radio classics here,"Almost any song from this album could serve as an excellent definition of classic hard rock. The songs are great, but the album isn't, because it's repetetive. Having a CD with multiple AC/DC songs on it is like wearing two raincoats--it just shows that more of a good thing isn't necessarily better. AC/DC is openly against innovation in music, and it shows. They're If you enjoy AC/DC on the radio (as I do), keep on enjoying it; it's best when it's one song at a time. If you actually buy the album, you're likely to be disappointed by the repetetiveness--unfortunately there's not much variation between songs.On the other hand, if you are going to own one AC/DC album, this is probably the best choice."
1,Back in Black,The product was very badly packed.The record doesn't fit in the box.The cover is creased.The record is warped.
4,Good,"Good album, but why the heck did they realese it like 10 times?, Is the band really that greedy for money? Well I dont know what version I have, but I'm not buying this album every few months just to get each version. Best songs are You shook me all night long, Back in Black, and Hell's Bells"
5,The epitome of rock and roll.,"This album is simply amazing. It comes at you all out from the beginning and never lets up. This is proof that rock and roll doesn't have to be fancy to be amazing. The booming drums come straight at you with nothing fancy but they get the job done in a big way. It is a wonderful experience to hear how the vocals, guitar and drum come together to create an amazing sound.Most any other band would be proud to put this forth as a greatest hits album for their career while to AC/DC it is just another great album.I love this whole album but my favorite track is ""Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution"" followed closely by ""Back in Black"", ""Hells Bells"" and ""You Shook Me All Night Long""."
4,I am so sorry...............,"Obviously this is one of the greatest rock & roll recordings of all time. So that is why I decided to buy this ""remastered"" version. Maybe it is the 'digipak' 2 channel mixdown that the glaring yellow label on the shrinkwrap extolls as virtues or some of the other reviews on Amazon that compelled me to buy this classic with ""higher"" audio quality.Well let me tell you I have quite a home system & car system & this mix is shrill. I feel if you already own the original than you would be better off keeping it sonically. The highs are rough at best. I will admit the low end is beefier though. But overall this CD is sonically LACKING.So the material gets a solid 5 from this 40 year old rock & roller. But as far as the mix'down' remaster I think I will wait until they try again & get it right with the sound. Peace............"
2,"Music is good, dualdisc doesn't","I'm very dissappointed with this dualdisc, unfortunately this dualdisc is only a CD side and a DVD-Video side, I thought it would be a DVD-AUDIO side with high resolution audio and it's not, it has standard, compressed, lossy dolby digital audio in 5.1 channels, what's the point?, music is good, im just reviewing this dualdisc edition which doesn't really add any good to the standard CD version which i already have! so it makes this a waste of money."
4,AC/DC is a lot better than I thought,"I heard one of their songs once (don't know which song) and I didn't like it that much. But later on I heard part of ""Hells Bells"", and I thought that it was pretty good. So I bought ""Back In Black"" and I like it a lot. The only song I don't like is ""Shake A Leg"" ( I don't like it becuase the chorus gets annoying). Rock fans should definately get this CD."
5,"BON SCOTT MAY BE DEAD, BUT AC/DC STILL ROCKS","THIS WAS THE 1ST AC/DC ALBUM THAT WAS RECORDED AFTER THE DEATH OF BON SCOTT. AND, THIS IS ANOTHER ROCK CLASSIC. AC/DC REALLY SHOW THAT THEY STILL ROCK ON SONGS LIKE ITS FAMOUS TITLE TRACK, ''YOU SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT LONG'' AND ''WHAT YOU DO FOR MONEY HONEY''. THIS MAY BE ONE OF THE GREATEST ROCK ALBUMS TO HAVE BEEN RELEASED IN THE 80S. ALL TRUE AC/DC FANS SHOULD HAVE THIS AND ''HIGHWAY TO HELL''. I ADVISE ALL ROCK FANS TO GET THIS CD THE NEXT TIME YOU GO TO A CD STORE."
4,"Some very good, very catchy classic rock songs","back in black has in my opinion 4 amazing songs. They are, in order of best to worst, back in black, you shook me all night long, rock and roll aint noise pollution and hells bells. The rest of the songs are pretty good but sound like bad imitations of the four classics. i would recommend buying this cd just for those 4 songs because they are so amazing. back in black is great for any fan of great music, particularly classic rock, who wants to get into ACDC."
4,"Well, not the greatest but damn good","I always hear people talking about acdc has the same song over and over with the same riffs. But the truth is they are really good musicians. They had talent and they knew how to use it. The most recognized song on here would be ""You shook me all night long"" but I personoly think ""Back in black"" is a better song. Pick this one up for sure....."
1,Pure Dookie,"No, of course not the album, which is obviously a classic. The dual-disc is a complete ripoff in relation to its advertising. As an audiophile (wannabe), I bought this version for the ""entire album in enhanced LPCM Stereo"" on the DVD side. Typically that would be at a much higher sampling rate, better bit depth, or something enhanced. In this case its 48khz, 16 bit PCM, which is basically the same quality as the CD side (more or less, perhaps a slight uptick). They didn't even use that much of the available storage on the DVD side and they gave us this! It's just wrong, wrong, wrong. Poor product design and deceptive advertising. No wonder this version is not a classic with the audiophiles. Who makes these decisions?"
2,AC/DC Back in Black CD,"This was a gift for my husband. He is a huge AC/DC fan and only had the album in vinyl for Back in Black. He was so excited to get it in the CD format. He has been listening to this CD and another I purchased him while he is working on building a brick wall in the front of our home. He says it brings him back to simpler times in his life. He has shared with our children, as well, his love for this group. Because of this album our children are becoming big AC/DC fans."
1,classic album....ripoff package,"Back in black is the best rocknroll album piriod.This ""digi pack"" is a ripoff though.The cd side of the disc is poor quality,it sounds like they remastered it with too much compression trying to make it sound more analog.The dvd side has a cool documentary and a high quality version of the audio cd but you can only play the hq version on your dvd player...?I also bought the remastered ""for those about to rock"" cd and its crisper but somone got a little overboard with the low end and you have to cut it with your eq.Save yourself some money and buy the older pre-remaster 16bit cds.I have the older cd and they sound better than the cd side of the digipack."
2,hate it. dont understand why everyone likes it,"Most of the songs sond alike,and drag on and onand get extremly anoying.There are three good songs,which are Hells bells,shoot 2 thrill and shook me all night long.Get Bon Scott insteds of this album."
2,Whose idea was it to hire this guy!?,"AC/DC probably had a hundred other applicants to replace Bon Scott. Why would they pick the least talented one of the bunch? Ol' Brian Johnson NEVER sings even a single word in a normal voice, all he does is scream into the microphone in an aggressive manner. He sounds like a cat with its b@lls caught in a vice. Absolutely talentless."
2,Singles shmingles,"I honestly feel that this album is terrible. Despite the fact that nearly every cut on the record inevitable became a hit single, the music is watery and repetitive. Bon Scott was the one and ONLY singer of AC/DC."
3,"Best album ever? Um, don't think so!","How can anyone say this is the best album ever? It's not heavy, it's not melodic, and all the songs sound the same! Okay, it is energetic, and many of the songs on here, such as ""Hells Bells"" and ""You Shook Me All Night Long"" are heralded as classics, but this is nowhere near the best album ever. This album came out in the same year as Iron Maiden's debut and Ozzy's ""Blizzard of Ozz"", and those two albums blow this one right out of the water. And, must I remind everyone of a little album called ""British Steel"", by a little band called Judas Priest? That album also came out in this year, and it too is far superior to ""Back in Black"". AC/DC is not a bad band, not at all, but they are far too repetitive and not nearly talented enough to deserve the godlike status they are given."
5,<<< FEEL >>>,"So many bands consider AC/DC music as simple three chord blues but this is just not accurate enough. So many bands try to cover these classic songs but they never get it right or hammer it home. The reason of course is what is called ""feel"". The sound of this album is so atmospheric, you could cut it with a knife. You can feel the sadness, the anger and despair of losing Bon. You can feel the sense of urgency to make what had to be the best product of their career and what you get out of listening to this is an education. You learn exactly why AC/DC has outsold The Rolling Stones, Aerosmith, and even the mighty Led Zeppelin because the music is never pretentious. It never tries to be more than just what it is which is good time, hard driving sweat soaked rock and roll and it is sincere."
2,DVD-Audio Quality Disappoints,"While the audio quality is okay for a CD, I bought it for the DVD-Audio quality. Everybody's correct in saying that it's two-channel PCM, and that's why I'm disappointed. Sure, it smokes next to other CDs, but it's just flat when you compare it to other DVD-Audio disks.If you want good surround mixes or lots of dynamics, take a listen to any of the Talking Heads discs included in their Brick collection or to Donald Fagen's Morph the Cat. Even the Who's Tommy, which was originally recorded in the late 60s, on DVD-Audio, has much more dynamic range and detail than this disk does.Sure, the music's good, but I was really hoping that the opening of Hell's Bells would rattle my teeth. Instead, it just rattles the cheap plastic clock I have hanging on the wall behind my system."
5,Guilty pleasure record......,"This is one of those cds that my dad always cranked up in the car when i was a kid and I now still love the songs and they really stick to me. ""Have a Drink On Me"" and ""You Shook Me All Night Long"" are my two favorites.""Hells Bells"" and ""Given The Dog A Bone"" are fun songs just to headbang around to. It's really fun music. Have I emphasized how fun this cd is.This is a must have cd. Period."
5,Back In Black,What can be said about the greatest rock album ever?AC/DC were at their best on this album.
4,Contains Two All-Time Rock Classics,"The title track and ""You Shook Me All Night Long"" alone justify the price. Even non-fans gotta play air guitar to the first 30 seconds of Back in Black, and the lyrics on ""You Shook Me All Night Long"" are classic... ""Workin' double time on the seduction line, she was one of a kind, she's just mine all mine.... had to cool me down to take another round, now I'm back in the ring to take another swing..."" For what many consider to be ""hard core"" they actually make good, good music that's easy to listen to."
5,WITHOUT ADOUT THE BEST ROCK BAND EVER,"Greatest band to ever step on stage . I have seen AC/DC every time Angus and the boys came to Indianapolis since Back in Black tour . Hell they even sleep with a few stripers I've known........( years back )Angus is THE ONLY TRUE guitar GOD ,Bon Scott was the best front man of his time, If not all time. Malcom & Cliff great guys that can play with the best of 'em ,Phil Rudd will beat the hell out of some skins and never miss a lick . and for the rest of the drummers that played on so many badass albums, you too ROCK! MY FRIENDS.***** 5 STARS***** from me. Hell I even have a AC/DC Tattoo to show off ."
5,A Carrer Defining Album! A Hard Rock Classic!,"What other band do you know could make a comeback after a tragic incident like the death of their lead singer. Enter AC/DC. Far superior than Highway to Hell, Brian Johnson adds strong vocals on every song on this cd. No disresepct to the Bon Scott era but this is AC/DC's best produced lyrically and musically. Hell Bells, What You Do For Money Honey, Back in Black, You Shook Me All Night Long, Shake a Leg, and Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution are the best songs on here. The whole album is good though. So get it because it is a true classic."
1,DualDisc Technology is fraudulent!! Beware!!,"Fantastic AC/DC album. But this format, the DualDisc junk..is just that...junk. It won't work on many computers and even some CD players. It's totally unreliable. Beware. I'm going to email DualDisc (their address is on the web) and give em' a piece of my mind. A total waste of money!"
5,The AC/DC Album,"This Album is dedicated to AC/DC's late lead singer, the inimitable Bon Scott. From the beginning AC/DC brings you into a world of Rock N Roll like nobody else can. The signature opening of Hells Bells is enough to get anyones adrenaline going and make the hair on the back of your neck stand up. The song Back in Black is another one that gets you going, as does You Shook Me All Night Long. These two songs make you just want to cut loose and sing along. Have A Drink On Me is a bar room classic. And the last track, Rock And Roll Aint Noise Pollution makes you wanna play slow air guitar and pay homage to Gibson extraordinaire Angus Young and Company in this salute to a great Rock And Roll legend from the greatest Rock band of all time, AC/DC."
3,Back in Black,"Not One of My favotites. More talent has been demonstrated Through the Years. Already have it on vynal, and cassette. Not much changed."
1,DualDisc with only 48 KHz/16 bit,Blatantly Sony did not want to cut into their SACD business. That is the result when consumer electronics manufacturers double as media publishers...
5,More Than 3 Chords,"Not only is this one of, if not the, best rock albums of all time, but it also uses more than merely three chords that so many dissidents seem to think. The excellent title cut here in fact uses the A, G, B, D, E, G# and A# chords. If you have ever thought about getting an AC/DC album, get this immediately! You will not regret it!"
1,Warning for those with a DVD-Audio player!,"I know another reviewer warned European buyers that it wouldn't play on their DVD-Video or DVD-Audio players, but it's not just Europe - it's the U.S. too!I have a DVD-Audio player in my car (Acura TL) and it would NOT play the DVD side of this disk.I found out too late that the DVD side of dual disks can come in different formats. Apparently the Nine Inch Nails dual disk is DVD-A compatible, but I'm not sure which others are.Amazon needs to provide more details on which format the DVD side of these dual disks contain!"
3,Great hard rock album.....Falters at the end,The first 7 songs here are amazing...but the last 2 songs are garbage. Definitly a great album but dont expect to play the album through without skipping a single song.
5,Bon Scott Is Still The Best,"I don't like the new guy, Johnson. But I have to say this is one of their greatest albums ever made. But if Bon sung it, it would have been one of the greatest rock albums EVER!!! But i Reconmend it."
2,"Skip away from it, unless you're a completist.","This is typical from Epic, the same record company that permitted Ozzy to re-record BLIZZARD OF OZZ and DIARY OF A MADMAN replacing the bass player and the drummer, and not even informing it the CD box...Now, we have the AC/DC catalog released again. They promised the public marvellous things. But you'll find none here.The graphic content is really impressive, top quality. There's also some worth texts. But, lyrics? Forget about them. There are none in the entire series, even in records that, in their first CD print, contained them (Example: DIRTY DEEDS DONE DIRT CHEAP). As for the bonus track connecting to the internet, they are joke: in BACK IN BLACK, there is none bonus track, just an interview with Brian Johnson.BACK IN BLACK, the music, is FIVE STARS. BACK IN BLACK, this package here, is just lust for money."
5,The Ultimate Hard Rock Album,"Non-stop a**kicking power from the original headbangers of rock and roll. The best album from the band who knows the true definition of rock and roll. ""Back in Black"" from start to finish will simply rock your world. Every song has energy that is not paralleled by any band ever. Lead Guitarist Angus Youngs' solo riffs are enough to blow your stereo to pieces. If you are a hard rock, heavy metal fan and you dont own this album then you are clueless."
5,when rock was rock,"Rock broke the mold with this album/CD. I first heard this when it was on vinyl back in 1980. We all knew, deep down in our bones, that were witnessing magic. Twenty-odd years later, it's obvious we were right. Compared to the crap called rock today, this CD is incredible. These guys today playing ""heavy"" rock are missing the one important thing that matters most-hooks! It's all about the songs, folks. None of AC/DC would win awards for being great musicians. But they perform enertaining music that ""sticks to your ribs"". They are The Beatles of hard rock!Every song here is a winner. Not to endorse drinking, but try not to slam a beer if this CD is playing! If you can, my hat's off to you. Own this piece of history!"
1,Back in Crap,"TO ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO THINK ACDC ARE THE COOL GUYS, WHO THINK THEY ARE THOSE CRAZY GUYS, YOU ARE WRONG, ACDC ARE LAME, VERY LAME, THEY KNOW LIKE THREE CHORDS AND HAVE THE COMBINED MENTAL AGE OF A FIVE YEAR OLD. THIS ALBUM IS A EXAMPLE OF HOW TO EFFECTIVELY LOWER THE COMMON IQ, THIS IS TRASH."
5,ac\dc,i would like too see ac\dc in live concert i been a fan for long time and i ant seen them at all i would love see them
1,AC/DC Rocks!! BUY THIS ALBUM!!,"Woaaa! I was blasted out of my seat after i heard this ablum! AC/DC Is Soooooo heavy! Trash, punk, dirty dirty, scarry metal! When i first heard the ablum i was eating a side salad!! And i almost choked! This calibur of music could easily be compared to the twisted guitar riffs of newfound glory or simple plan!"
1,BRIAN JOHNSON SUCKS,"Why do people like Brian Johnson so much? His voice is awful, mustardy, lousy, absurd, stupid, pathetic, lame, horrible and he only screams, dosent sing at all and this is one of the worst hard rock albums ever. they mainly should have quit right after Scott died because he was a bad replacement for Bon Scott too. Dont buy this CD as you'll panic about it later."
5,The Best of ACDC,By far Back in Black was ACDC epic album...The entire album (CD) is great from beginning to end...They were at the top of their game making this one. I also own Black Ice and that one takes a lot of characteristics from Back in Black.I've listen to ACDC for ever and granted Bon Scott was a perfect fit in the very early days RIP but this album was a giant leap forward in what they had done before this...If I had to pick 5 all time albums ever made Back in Black would be in it.
5,Still a classic!,Bought this for my 11 & 8 year old boys and they love it. Brings me back to the late 70's or early 80's when I was starting to listen to Rock.
5,"Great album, nice mini-DVD story line","I bought this (finally) as a replacement for the old worn out LP, after giving up that AC/DC will ever be on iTunes. The album speaks for itself as one of the greatest metal albums of all time.But the DVD, though short, is great. I saw both the Bon Scott fronted and Brian Johnson fronted AC/DC at live concerts (yeah, showing my age). The history review, of the long overdue success brought on by the Highway to Hell album, Bon's death from drinking (so they say), and the Back in Black themed album ""tribute"" featuring Johnson is well done, though I wish it were longer. Comments by Malcom and Angus are great, it's kinda scary to see Angus looking normal without his schoolboy uniform and back pack.And, it is strangly reassuring to see that Angus' receding hairline matches my own!Highly recommended, and used to continue my 15 year old's education into my world of Rock N Roll."
1,One Of The Worst Albums Ever,"What is the big deal with this album? Each of these songs are worse than a bag of kittens being hit against a brick wall with three guitar chords being played over again. God, this is the equivilant of a tightly coiled pile on the lawn left by my dog. When will this band they only have one decint album, High Voltage? To all the people in the world, STOP BUYING THIS ALBUM! IT SUCKS! IF I COULD GIVE IT A LOWER REVIEW, I WOULD! Please consider this review when you want to buy it."
1,HEALVILY OVERRATED. FRIED OVER AND OVER.,THIS ALBUM is one of the worst i have ever heard. A guy screaming and a guitar playing 3 chords and a crappy solo. He is running around in a little boys cloths what tht supposed to prove tht he is a pedifile. This is one of the worst excuses for an album. NO doubt 1 star.
1,Angus beef sucks,the guitar and bass riffs suck balls the singer sound like he is getting raped my favorite song on the album is back in the ass
4,Only 4 Good Songs,"I think I'll give this CD 4 stars because I like all four songs.Hells Bells, Shoot to Thrill, You Shook Me, and Have a Drink onMe. Better together with Highway to Hell, and AC/DC Live."
5,The definitive AC/DC album.,"Surely the best, most solid, guitar-driven hard rock album of the century. 'Nuff said."
5,best cd of all time,This is by far the best rock cd ever made by any band.From start to finish its just straight forward rock n roll.No band does it better or louder.Angus and the boys are awesome and will always be the who every band compares themselves too.ROCK-ON PEOPLE
5,GREASTEST ROCK RECORD OF ALL TIME,"BACK IN BLACK-nuff said.This album represents true rock n roll in it's purest form. Songs like BACK IN BLACK, SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT LONG, HELL'S BELLS, WHAT DO YOU FOR MONEY, HONEY?, SHOOT TO THRILL and HAVE A DRINK ON ME still sound fresh over 20 years after they were released. This album will forever be remembered and honored as the greatest rock record ever made. In other words buy the damn thing."
5,really obvious why we luv it,"ever since i listened to this album i've been hooked to ACDC. hook, line and sinker. with songs such as ""honey what do you do for money"" ""let me put my love into you"" and ""You shook me all night long"" its hard not to get a rock and roll feeling into u. it's hard not to jump up and down and do the air guitar and sing along with the chorus. it's so good that even if i was asleep i would still be bouncin'!!!!!!!! so just order this and be prepared to rock, rock, rock!!!!!!!!!!"
4,amazing,"This is an amazing album! Back In Black (the song not album) actually really annoys the hell out of me, because I hear it so many times probably. Even with that, every song is awesome on this album. What I don't like is when people don't like AC/DC just because they hear the same songs over and over on the radio...you have to get into their other not-SO-popular music too to really get to like them sometimes. And this album, is definitely one of their best, not JUST because of the song Back In Black, but because of EVERY song on it."
4,"""STILL SHAKIN! """,A ROCK CLASSIC! Title track is legendary tune.I'll always remember ANGUS running around on stage in his school boy outfit with that great guitar!BRIAN JOHNSON's vocals like no other.This album set the standard for ACDC and my party years!LOL.This is a great LIVE band.A totally collectable album-MUST HAVE!KEEP ON ROCKIN'
5,Yo yo yo,"I think I got into AC/DC a little late (two days ago), but I'm 17, so I can't be like all of you old fogeys who went to see them live in '84. :DNooch. Anyway this album is, in my opinion, one of the best in music history, and should be loved be fans and critics alike."
4,Best AC/DC CD Ever,"I play guitar and I like rock music. I have 5 of the bands' CDs, and this is by far their best overall work. After the unfortunate death of lead singer Bon Scott, Bryan Johnson replaced the singing role. Johnson does an excellent job singing and Angus and Malcolm show us how it's done with the guitar shredding. If anything, I would have preferred more backing vocals by the Youngs, as in the album ""Highway To Hell"". Probably the best three songs are ""Hells Bells"", ""Back In Black"", and ""You Shook Me All Night Long"". ""Shake A Leg"" and ""Have A Drink On Me"" are alright songs, but they aren't the best in the band's history. The other 5 songs are in between on the rating scale, but don't take my word for it, buy the CD. You won't be disappointed."
3,Mello AC,"Rumored to stand for ""Away from Christ/Devil's Children"" or ""both ways,"" this is a mellower offering with some hits from the MTV video period. Among the best albums the band has done, they're arguably even bigger today than they were in their prime. Not seriously satanic, or even intimidating."
5,101.9999% Rock and Roll,"yessssss.. just be sure and crank the vol. to 11. See this band live at least once before you croak, and you will have lived a full and happy life. long live rock and roll..."
5,A hard rock classic,"Back in black is in plain and simple words one of the best hard rock albums ever.This is amongst my favourites and contains some top notch songs in Hells Bells,You shook me all night long and the terrific title track.very highly recommended along with For those about to rock we salute you."
1,review based on sound quality only,"i love the album, but i must strongly disagree with some other reviewers saying that the dvd side sounds better than the cd side, i have good gear (not a home theater in a box)i couldnt tell the difference even in a blind test, and no one i got to listen to it could tell either. the only difference between sides is 16 bit 44.1 khz for cd, and 16 bit 48 khz for dvd.amazon should really address this issue and get a backbone and post the truth about all sony/bmg dual disc titles. but like everyone else, amazon is probably petrified of sony.JUST A FOLLOWUP TO MR. STEVEN M GADDIS, THE DVD SIDE OF BACK IN BLACK IS NOT EVEN IN THE SAME BALLPARK AS DVD AUDIO, ITS NOTHING MORE THAN DOLBY DIGITAL STEREO, THATS IT!!...PERIOD, AND I AM SORRY BUT I HAVE LISTENED TO BOTH SIDES ON MERIDIAN GEAR PARTNERED WITH B&W; NAUTILUS SPEAKERS, AND THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL, AND THAT MY FRIEND IS THE HARD FACTS, SONY IS PULLING AN OLD FASHIONED BAIT AND SWITCH!!!!"
5,more than 3 chords!!!!,"hmm hmm.... all u idiots who say ac/dc is 3 chords....I can play all the song on this cd on guitar(im 14) and they are WAY more than 3 chords. for u @$$holes who say they have no skill, try playing there solos. fod, man. F O D!!!!!!THIS IS THE GREATEST CD EVER MADE!!!!! BUY IT OR BURN IN HELL!!!!!!"
5,Have a Drink On Me!,"I once saw a review that called this album ""pretentious."" Not sure how you might come to that conclusion, as this is some hard rockin', a$$ kickin', riff driven, groovy rock n' roll. It's about as unpretentious as you can get. There's not a weak track on here, and thank God AC/DC didn't call it quits with the death of vocalist Bon Scott, as this album is, along with Appetite for Destruction, one of two must have albums from the 1980s. A few years past its silver anniversary, this album still sounds fresh and wonderful, and if you can't have a great time listening to this...well, I pity you."
5,back in black is back,"back in black is probably the best album ive ever heard. the songs: hells bells, back in black and you shook me all night longhit the top 10 list."
1,Piece of junk!,Do not buy this book! i don't know which idiot was the publisher but the book sucks! u can not get when does a chapter begins or end! it is just tex with no paragraphs or anything! i hate it! i ahve sent it back and haven't got my money yet!
5,Agree!!!,"I totally agree with the other reviewers. Reading this book is an enjoyment.Better yet, this book has both to-the-point explaination _and_ example on all topics.I would say, if you wanted to learn tricks to doing things, this is for you. Don't forget this book concludes with full examples/templates showing how people configure their ISP core and edge routers/switches."
1,Warning,"I bought these as a cheap replacement for the real, HEPA filters.I had a task at a friends house and brought along my vacuum to clean up.I didn't want to waste a good bag.These bags do not trap fine particles and will pass dirt into the rest of your machine.The bag full warning light came on after about 5 minutes of cleaning.I spent an hour cleaning out the inside of my vacuum after I was finished.I'm buying a new pair of post filters too since they got so fouled up.I really can't see any savings using these bags over the quality bags."
5,vacuum bags,I really like these vacuum bags...they are way cheaper than buying the brand name version and I haven't noticed a difference. This is important to me since I have 2 golden retrievers and vacuum constantly. No problems here. I will definitely stick with these in the future.
5,Why pay more when these work exactly the same?!?,"Always running out of these bags...But recently tried this brand and have had no issues to complain about. They are as good as the OEM bags or most other makers. Heck, you fill them with dirt off the floor and throw them away - why pay more than you have to?They work just fine! So fine that we already ran out of the last order and just ordered 4 more 6-packs. Should last us for a while now...."
5,We need to pass this book onto others and have them to the same,This book is the first testimony I read straight from a North Korean.I must tell you it is a book that is very likely to bring tears to your eyes. In this case that is a good thing. We all need to learn about what happens in North Korea. These are the worst human rights violations in the world. The fact that was even more shocking is the fact that you can lose your right to be a human. That fact alone should really make us see the picture.There is a reason she lived to tell about it. She shouldn't be alive but God made it happen.Yes this picture does give graphic depictions of torture but that is what it is and should really make us all think.If she can I would love to see her write another book. Maybe like how she adjusted to a new way of life with her son (Its a real blessing for him as well). What she has done with her new life and to remind us of where she and her son came from which we will all do well to remember.
4,Eyes of the Tailless Animals: Prison Memoirs of a N Korean Woman,"As I read this book I was constantly astonished at the depravity of the North Korean government policies and the lack of value they placed on human life.I also noted the amazing ability the creator programmed into the human body tosustain its-self through torture, starvation and inhuman conditions. I rejoiced when I read of true Christians giving their lives for fellow believers and cried when I realized the punishment they received while nearly unbelievable and disgusting is only a portion of what is to come for the Christians of today who allow the goodness of society to lull them into just a talk and not a real walk with the Lord. This book is a modern day Fox's Book of Martyrs and will strengthen your resolve to live a better life."
5,Heart breaking tale of Soon Ok Lee's false imprisonment in North Korea,"This book made me feel like I cannot sit still while something this horrific is going on in our world. Many of the people imprisoned were there because of depraved party bosses. The depravity and debasement of a society that punishes those who love God should sear the conscious of everyone. This book should be read by every one who helps shape policy. My prayer is for Korean reunification minus the godless communism. When states or leaders become ""gods"" that is when the most heinous depravities begin. As our own nation marches toward taking God out of the schools and out of national life and hedonism and materialism replace our spiritual ideals this book should be a warning that any nation can fall and be degraded. This book is a graphic portrayal of a communist gulag. It is important to read this to help shape your world view and sensitize your conscious."
4,"The cap does the job, but...","The cap does what it should, but it took a very long time to get here. I'm a little spoiled by Prime, but it took well over a week."
1,reviewed without watching...and I won't!,I was so excited to see this on the rack of new releases at TOWER Records today...until I turned to the back cover to find...BOTH FILMS are presented PAN AND SCAN FULL SCREEN! I urge fans of these films to boycott...aborted versions...these aren't saturday morning cartoons..we want the full aspect ratio as presented in the theatres!If you are a film buff..AVOID this edition.
4,Not Great but Very Good,"This is a French Foreign Legion movie with some flavor, March or Die that is. Great scenic viewing, it looked realistic. Gene Hackman was great as always in the lead role. This movie can give the viewer an education on the charasmatic Moroccan leader Abd el-Krim and the Riff wars 1911-1927, they portray him as an honorable and noble yet brutal leader. March or Die can be used as somewhat of a history lesson for this period in world events. A decent buy for a two for one price even though production quality is lacking.The Wind and the Lion would be a good companion movie."
1,Highly disappointing,"In comparison with other statistics books, I found this one to be lacking. Important definitions were introduced but they were not expanded. The questions presented during and at the end of the chapters were okay but the references in the chapter that should have provided the answers were inadequate. I felt it was a poorly written, poorly organized book that cannot hold a candle to the majority of college level introductory level statistic textbooks."
3,This book lacks the depth necessary to become widely used.,"This book is alright, yet lacks the necessary steps required to make it understandable. It skips over widely used and necessary information. I would not reccomend this book."
2,acurate and complete but it will seriousely put you to sleep,"I read part of chapter 1 and didnt read any more.. extremely dull. Good for reference,not for reading"
5,Churchill's Own Review of His Art,"Written by Churchill himself, this book gives the reader a view through the writer's eyes the reason he chose painting and of the paintings themselves. A rather short book, 32 pages of text and 16 pages of art, is quite informative in the life of Churchill and his view of life around him."
5,"Quotable essay, good color plates","Pithy quotes by one of the twentieth century's most popular orators are not limited to his hobby of painting. Churchill gives advice on one's relationship with one's book collection (treat them as acquaintances and at least open them and read any attractive paragraph, rather than be intimidated by the thought of having to read them cover to cover and leave them forever lonely on the shelf), whether to be fluent in one foreign language or a dilettante in several, and life in general. The color plates are few but of high quality."
5,The Heart of Winston Churchill,"First the book itself is a treasure. It is a reprint in the style of the original 1932 edition with the bonus of color plates. ""I do not presume to explain how to paint, but only how to get enjoyment."" With unabashed openness he describes his awakening awareness of nature, the joy of fixing a mess quickly, planning and adjusting to the needs of the painting. ""I think this heightened sense of observation of Nature is one of the chief delights that have come to me through trying to paint."" Anyone who paints beginner to professional will benefit as they get to know Winston Churchill at his leisure. A great gift for a painter friend."
5,pink kitchenaid soft handle shears,"great for the kitchen, very, very useful. use it all the time. luv it."
4,Nice Kitchen Shears,"They are sharp, good weight, sturdy, and work well. They have a nice, clean cut. The grip is comfortable. They come with a plastic guard. I kept it as a safety precaution for my drawer. This would be good for people with children. It takes a little pull to get it off and might be enought to prevent children from using them without supervision."
3,"A study of influences upon James Joyce, Homer, Aristotle and others","Contains detail on how Joyce developed Ulysses' structure based on Homer's Odyssey. It includes the types of revisions he made to his structure as he wrote, while undergoing his own ""odyssey"" through Italy. I didn't learn as much from this as from Ellmann's other books. I did find it parts of it intriguing: his connection with J.M. Synge; admiration for ""Riders to the Sea"" and relief that Synge wasn't interested in Aristotle's philosophy, leaving Joyce free to develop Aristotle's ideas in his own way. Joyce comes through this book as working consciously to define himself as unique, staking out terrain in ""Ulysses"" unclaimed by his Irish contemporaries."

4,A great CD from start to finish!,"K.T. Oslin strongly announces her return to the music world with this outstanding CD flawlessly produced by Raol Malo of The Mavericks. K.T. effortlessly delivers convincing vocals in every track, whether the song is uptempo and fun, or filled with the sadness of a love gone stale. Favorite cuts for me are the title track, Mexico Road, I Can't Remember Not Loving You, plus Drivin', Cryin', Missin' You. The listener gets a pleasant surprise with the stripped-down version of If You Were The Only Boy In The World which flows right into the laidback swing of Mean To Me. K.T. sings Cole Porter and it's a match made in heaven! And with her sultry technopop rendition of Come On A My House, K.T. promises much more than candy! I can't say enough good things about this CD! Add it to your collection!"
4,just what i wanted,i've been looking for this album for time.it came in really good condition and is now part of my playlist.
1,Not Pleased,I use to have the same type of wallet made by COACH it was very good at securing credit cards and money. This wallet has pockets that are too big. After having my credit cards fall out in my pocket I stopped using it. I would not recommend this wallet to keep credit cards secure. I will try to find another COACH. A complete waste of my Amazon Gift Certificate.
1,Don't buy these from Joe Muscle,"I ordered Power Systems Soft Touch Balls. Joe Muscle sent j/fit Toning Balls instead. The j/fit balls will probably be OK, and I don't want to hassle with an exchange, but as a result of their product substitution I will never place an Amazon order if I see ""Joe Muscle"" as the vendor again."
5,Touching,"Willow King is about a girl named Katie with a disability. When a horse is born with crooked legs, and the owner wants to put him down, Katie protests. Feeling a special bond with Willow King, she bargains and manages to save the colt. This book illustrates the troubles of bringing up a young colt, not to mention possibly a new boyfriend. A must read for anyone that likes horses."
4,A great book,"When I read this book, I had to finish it that night. It was so good. Katie was a really good character. I liked how she felt for the baby colt because he had a similar handicap, like hers. The subplots were great. The actual plot was nicely developed. The range of diffrent personalities in the characters was amazing and gave the story nice contrast. All in all it was wonderful."
4,A good and touching book,"I borrowed Willow King from my local library and liked it alot. i personaly think that horse racing is rather mean, but this book was good. I reccomend it for kids 8 to 12. Enjoy!"
5,A believable leading character you can really root for!,"This is my favorite horse book ever. I've read all the Thoroughbred Series, the Saddle Club books, Farley, etc., pretty much everything available;this beats 'em all! The character of Katie was so real and wonderful and strong without being a spoiled brat. Her relationship with her mother and friends and the trainer who encouraged her were all so warm and real. It just makes you feel good and hopeful but it's also exciting. More Chris Platt books, please!"
4,Joey has gotten Better,"Hey, I've read some reviews here, and I both agree and disagree with them. I'd like to point out that Joey has gotten a lot better since this album. This album was put out in a rush, and I agree the engineering was not top notch. It was done by his father, but if you go to www.joeypearson.com and buy his new CD, Novel, you will see a huge different. Not only has Joey's voice improved, but the tracks are awesome, and very well done. Four of them were done in studio, and the other four recorded at home, and I'm quite sure that you won't be able to distinguish them. I recommend everyone buy the new CD."
3,Great Kid - Not So Great Songs,"Hey, What can I say, but that Joey can sing! A Friend bought me the CD and I personally would have never bought it myself. I think if he would have had someone else write and produce his music the CD would have been better. Vocally Joey will get better with age, perhaps after his voice change. I shaw him on Star Search and was impressed with his movement on stage, but perhaps learning to dance may help him in the future. Good Luck Joey!"
3,can carry a tune...,"Joey is definitely much better than the average kid his age (and, well, let's face it--he's better than a lot of grownups, as well); but I still think he has a ways to go. He uses wayyyyy too much vibrato when singing, for instance; some vibrato is good, but not when it starts to stick out and grate on the listener. The songs were also a bit too simplistic musically speaking for my taste, although one or two had a great message (Younger Generation)--although I don't want to seem to be advocating ageism, I strongly believe that the simplicity in his music has a lot to do with his young age. The music was also rough, which I can understand as I believe this is akin to an indie CD.In any case, Joey obviously has potential and I bet he'll make it far, but probably not until he has a few more years under his belt and some musical training. :)"
3,"Excellent voice, too much engineering","I enjoyed the CD, but the reverb on Joey's voice detracts from the listening experience. The kid gets a 5 for the singing, the engineers get a 1 for the poor recording."
2,Dissappointed a little,"I was really really looking forward to listining to Joeys CD after I read what everyone was saying about how awesome a singer he was. I think maybe he had his friends write some reviews for him because he isnt as good as everyone says I dont think.He sings like a little kid who can sing pretty good. But he does Opera type trilling in every single line and it is annoying to me. Besides that the echo is triple a normal recording and the songs are pretty silly.I think he must have recorded himself in the garage and then put it out here. Oh well, lived and learned. When his voice gets stronger he will probably be better and he may have some real songs to sing as well. Maybe I will check him out in a few years."
5,Another young superstar on the horizon!,"Joey Pearson is another youngster that has come upon the horizon to entertain both young and old alike, His album (Something To Say) tells it all, with such great songs as, Your Worth The Time, My Dream, Don't Give Up, I'll Be Your Friend and Once In A Lifetime. This youngster is right up there with Billy Gilman, Aaron Carter, and Declan Galbrith, demonstrating the beautiful voice and exceptional talent that God blessed him with. I predict that Joey Pearson will be around for a long time bringing joy and love to the world. Watch this rising star grow even brighter as time goes by."
4,I'm quite impressed!,"Joey Pearson is, in my opinion, a pretty darn good singer for his age; not the cream of the crop, but better than most 10-year-olds. I'm not sure whether he takes vocal lessons, but if not I think they could really benefit him. He has a very strong vibrato but he needs to learn to control it, as I must say it hurts my ears. His voice is also rather tinny, which can get annoying after a while, but he's definitely got talent, and I'd definitely give him a chance! If little boy singers that sound like girls ins't your cup of tea, you don't have to like him, but I happen to love little boy singers! No one I've seen so far can compete with Billy Gilman, but I still will acknowledge their talent. Good luck Joey! Keep singing!"
5,This book is brilliant!,"It's clear, logical, easily understandable and has a table that is extremely insightful, helpful and practical for anyone who wants to turn a situation, process or change into a multi-step plan.Yes, it builds on Kuhn. But it goes a bit further. And because it's specifically oriented towards implementing a learning process in Artificial Intelligence, that 'learning' orientation can easily be translated to 'organizational' or even 'individual learning'.A highly valuable asset!"
5,Holds all the answers,"This is the most amazing book, it's a modern tool to help us map our spiritual potential. Lynda Hill has tapped universal astrological information and produced it in a heart felt easy to use 'oracle'. The truths of the symbols as written in this book added with some intuitive inspiration gives an individual the power to take, transform and understand each symbol as it personally influences us, in the moment, and as a guide to self discovery.I LOVE this book!"
3,Lasted two weeks,"and stopped working. Asked the vendor for a replacement and they agreed, no hassles. Hoping the second one is better."
2,"IPOD alarm function, too loud!","I bought this product based on the sole glowing review. There is one major problem with the unit. When using the IPOD for wakeup, the Volume is blaringly loud. The lowest the volume will go to is 10!!!When listening to the IPOD normally while its docked the Volume can be taken down to Zero.The only song I can wake up to is ""New Slang"" by the Shins because the song gradually gets louder from the start.I can't recommend this product."
4,Pretty Good For the Price,Works well and as expected. Sound quality is decent and controls are easy to use.The one flaw is that you cannot set the alarm volume below 10 when it can definitely play below 10. I'll prob buy another cd alarm clock just so I can wake up to quieter music.
1,No Insect Screen,Don't buy this. Look elsewhere. The screen on the inside is a wide welded wire that even a fat bee or hornet could walk through. Then you'll have nests in your attic.
1,"gran historia , editado de manera horrible","Esta novela me gusto mucho, porque era una historia, en la que no hubo villanos solo situaciones en las que personas tienen que enfrentar. Una mujer abandonada por su esposo por otra y encuentra una 2da oportunidad en un joven 16 anos menor que ella.La edicion en esta novela fue tan horrible, quien edito esta telenovela realmente no sabia lo que estaba haciendo. No sé como telemundo puede vender algo de tan baja calidad. En esta telenovela tantos conflictos fueron editados, como por ejemplo el conflicto de Jeronimo y su hijo que no acepta a Victoria, el conflicto del la compañera de trabajo de Jeronimo que le desarrolla una atracción fatal por él. También la discusión entre la otra y Victoria, el cual es un momento climático en la novela y, en fin, los problemas de la hija mayor de Victoria. Este DVD fue tan mal editado que no recomendaría que lo compraran."
2,Sadly Disappointed,"Sadly, the quality of the actual DVD was so bad, it made the DVD player make odd noises when loading. The second disappointment has to do with the content, which did not match the actual program as it was aired on TV.Overall rating for quality and content...2. Terribly disappointed."
4,Trying Really Hard!!,"Well, I bought this DVD even if I knew it didn't have English subtitles!! I thought that I would be able to make out one or two things, but BOY, was I wrong!!! The spanish spoken in here flows like a waterfall, but I will soldier on to the finish. My main interest was the storyline, older woman and younger man, and I want to see how that plays out!!As for the DVD itself, it is a quality package, security sealed. It contains 4 double sided DVD's. I haven't gotten to the end (the spanish is tooooo much!!), but so far, so good.My only compaint is the subtitles.The production company should put in subtitles, for the sake of non-Spanish speakers, and for those who are deaf!! Surely!! Is that too much to ask????"
2,"""Victoria"" - not happy!!","This is not what I expected. All the scenes that I liked from the ""Telenovela Victoria"" were deleted. What made ""Victoria"" a great novela for me was Jeronimo's way of winning Victoria's heart and THAT was missing from this DVD. You probably will like it if you did not see it on TV."
2,Spike Black Leather Dog Collar,I was pleased with the timeliness of my order and the appearance and fit of the collar. What I have found just days after my dog wearing the collar is that the coloring is coming off. I don't understand that.
5,Timeless information,"Erwin Di Cyan's pocket-sized book ""Vitamin E and aging"" is, in my opinion, a small gem when it comes to information on vitamin E. It brings to life scientific conclusions from decades ago, still relevant today and mixes them with later research and common sense, in a way that makes obvious the healthy natural ""timelessness"" of the facts talked about in the book, and it is one of those books to which I find it useful to return, because it contains knowledge of the sort that takes time to digest and implement... in short: it's a GOOD BOOK..."
5,Five Star General,"I cook every day,and have awarded Five Stars to this wonderful pan for ""General Use"".With its high sides,it is perfect for: stir fries,sautees,sauces,smashing big fry-ups and simmering soups and stews. It will beautifully brown and braise chops ,chicken or chuck roasts,and I've even made chili in it.Anyway,you get the idea.Add easy clean-up,as well as attractive design(that gleaming lid reminds me of the hubcaps on my old V W Beetle),and you've got a Patton of a Pot!On the stove top ,or in a moderate oven,this ""General"" is prepared to conquer your collection!Lets see...I think I can retire about three other pans.Buy this...you won't be sorry!"
5,Gorgeous,"The word gorgeous applies to both the 1560V's picture quality and exterior styling. I personally prefer this black one, although you might want to check out the gray (white?) one if that's your color. Teh contrast ratio is excellent, and according to a recent PC World research report (and much to my pleasant surprise), NEC-Mitsubishi understates the contrast ratio on their LCD monitors, so you get more than what the manufacturer tells. (Apparently all the South Korean manufacturers overstate their contrast ratio, therefore shortchanging their customers this way.) Even though this is only a 15-inch LCD, the screen feels big due to the black frame. Set-up is a breeze, even for most beginners. And it stands out nicely on your desktop. I've owned another NEC LCD monitor for over 4 years and have had no problem, so I feel confident about the 1560V's quality as well. Very highly recommended. This is the one to get, unless you want the NEC-Mitsubishi 17-inch or larger LCDs. :)"
3,Its okay.,The shade has a nice appearance to it. It doesnt look like an eyesore in the back window like some shades. It is effective in keeping the sun out. The problem is that it restricts the view out of the back window. And at night you can't see anything but blurry headlights. So it definitely needs to be removed for night driving which is a pain. Another problem is that the suction cups don't stick very well. Its a hassle because at red lights I'm reaching back there to put the shade back up. Since I haven't found a alternative this shade will have to work for now.Edited to add that the suction cups stick much better with a little bit of vaseline on them.
5,The New John McNab(s),"For those of you who have read the original John Buchan this book is a wonderful treat. It has the same pace as the original and the description of the hills is equally accurate. While it has the same flavour of the original, it takes place in modern day Scotland with a wonderful set of characters. The story line is similar to the original, but difeerent enough to keep your attention. A definite read for those suffering from the ""ennui""!"
4,Light Highland Yarn,"Greig has an incredible facility with language - he's actually a poet - and this, like his earlier book, The Electric Brae is beautifully and fluently crafted.In contrast to his first novel, it's a much lighter more entertaining read set in the Scottish Highlands and harking back to John Buchan's original. Not massively serious, but what used to be called a damn good yarn.If you want something with bigger, darker teeth try the Electric Brae. It doesn't seem to be listed on amazon.com, but it should be at amazon.co.uk and is simply one of the most amazing books I've read, full stop."
3,Unnecessary remake of a Classic,"Poachers announce what they will be poaching and which landowner the victim will be. From there it is a cat-and-mouse game: will they get away with the goods or will the estate owner protect his property and territory. Set in contemporary Scotland with Prince Charles and Balmoral as a potential ""victim"" and an assortment of characters, some more likeable than others. John Buchan's wonderful classic novel gets a retelling here but to what purpose? It certainly isn't as good as the original (though the writing isn't bad and the text is quite readable). I assumed there would be some ""building"" upon the original novel and that is why I invested my money and time. Alas, in that I was to be disappointed. Read this if you must, but you would be better off with the original."
4,"Entertaining, Amusing, and Very Scottish","This well written novel features the adventures of a group trying to pull-off a spectacular series of game thefts (aka ""poaching"") from various estates in Scotland. They do so in commemoration of the famous poacher John Macnab.The text has many Scottish dialect words that will be unfamiliar to American English readers, but most can be figured out from context and none of them stop the easy flow of the novel as it rushes to its rather profound conclusion."
3,Not the size I expected,"I'm disappointed with with item because the sides are sloped such that the bottom of the pan is only 9.5 inches in diameter. Otherwise, I found it to heat evenly with good nonstick properties. I decided to keep it but it won't be as versatile as I originally intended."
1,"that""s not movie","si eres cubano ni la compres ni la rentes , es una estafa total , esa porqueria no es una pelicua , es una falta de respeto a cuba"
1,Do Not Buy This Game!!,When I bought this game i thought it looked pretty desent compared to some other games. But the first time i put the game in i hated it. The helicopter is soooo hard to figure out the controllers. And the graphics are just plain sad. Its not worth even looking at!!
1,The Bachs!,"Out of Chicago, and only 150 Albums, and why? DUDE, this group is not even near the Beatles Style or any other group that can come to mind! The Group Sucks Big Time! I mean it! Hell, I could even go further on that! The Groups Donnie and the Good Times, The Spectrum (UK) and The Sidewalk Skipper Band is even better then that Group! And that's saying a lot right there! ( Really don't want to through in ""The Rainbow Press"", I think that's stretching it a bet )! WOW, if You really want a CD or Album of historical value, I suggest Sainte Anthony's Fyre on Zonk Records! There You go Dude!!!"
3,Stick to the poetry,"as a devoted Smith fan, it pains me to say that everything that makes Stevie Smith a compelling and original poet seems to work against her as a novelist. NOYP is too cute, too self-consciously experimental, and terribly dated. For those seeking insight into Smith's unique and fervid imaginative life, it's interesting, but not much fun to read more than once."
5,WHAT A GEM,"From a long time Rory fan, this is a real treat. It's a beautifully put together album of acoustic rarities and lost recordings, loving constructed by Rory's brother. Unlike many out-takes and rarities albums being issued currently, this collection doesn't sound contrived or superfluous. Let's hope Donal will continue to sift through his brother's back catalog for other material that Rory's fans can savor and relish in years to come. Perhaps a CD or two of backstage jamming or after-hours acoustic plucking? Oh, and for those of you who haven't discovered this yet, get a copy of the Irish Tour DVD - it's the best blues/rock you'll ever see and hear, conveyed with unusual honesty and humility."
4,Great Acoustic Work from an Electric Legend,"I have been a fan of Rory's since his days with Taste in the late 60's. From then until his untimely passing in the mid 90's, he was my favorite blues-rock guitarist. This CD showcases his far too infrequently heard from acoustic work. I shall treasure it always, and recommend it to all."
2,Squandered opportunity,"This is a novel that should be very engaging from both an historical and a character perspective. It details the lives of two Gauls serving in the Roman army who end up among the captured legionaries serving the Parthians after Cassius' defeat. Unfortunately, it is merely an extended set of episodes, not a unified narrative. The characters and context are likewise thoroughly undeveloped--no immersion at all in the world of Gauls, Romans, or Parthians. The novel is equally disappointing from a military perspective--no rich descriptive material on tactics or events. The book feels like an outline for something much, much richer, but as it stands is merely an uninspired exercise."
5,Great book on learning to sail,"I learned to sail by reading this book and sailing on a 15 1/2 foot daysailer. The book is easy to understand and should be required reading for all beginning sailors. Although dated, the instruction is timeless. A word of caution---sailing can be habit forming; my husband and I circumnavigated."
5,objective portrait of Imperial Capital,"Nice and readable presentation of the daily life in imperial Rome. You can ''see'' ordinary Romans from each social class living their everyday life. If you do not want to be affected by hollywood-like productions about antiquity, which present strongly artificial image of this epoch you have to read this book."
5,Excellent!,"The final chapter of this book might be the most important thing you will ever read on the believer's ground of assurance. Certain knowledge of one's salvation (justification) is to be based solely in the promise of God and NEVER in good works. This is just as Calvin taught who said in his Institutes of the Christian Religion, ""If men begin to judge whether they are regenerate by good works nothing will ever be more uncertain or more evil' (and) 'If works be judged by themselves by their imperfection they will no less declare God's wrath than by their incomplete purity will testify to his benevolence' (and) 'When a Christian looks to himself he can only have grounds for anxiety, indeed despair' (and) 'We should not seek assurance by conjecture, for faith corresponds to a simple and free promise, hence no place for doubting is left!'"""
4,The Toff would make a great TV series!!,"I've always thought that The Toff would make a great TV series. The Baron, also by John Creasey, was very successful in UK and USA. This book recounts one of The Toff's adventures abroad and may seem old fashioned to some because he travels by luxury liner not by air!! This only adds to the charm of the adventure which has lots of interesting characters including a New York cabbie Sikoski and good locations such as the Waldorf Astoria. The Toff has to rescue a kidnapped millionaire business man from a gang of New York hoodlums and has lots of interesting encounters before bringing the case to a successful conclsion. I bought my copy years ago in paperback by Coronet and have fifteen titles in all and would recomment them to anyone who likes private detective fiction. Any TV producers reading this please note!"
5,The old lady is hilarious!,"The first twelve pages of The Stone Angel are tedious. It took me nearly a month to get past them, but once I did, I couldn't put this book down. Hagar Shipley's wit killed me; the cruelty she inflicts on her kids, and which they repay, got me upset. By the end of the night (I read it all at once) I felt like I'd seen a whole life in pieces, which is how life tends to look when we think back. Hagar screws up, but she doesn't back down. She lives life her way and pays for it. I wouldn't want to have tea with her, but I'm glad she's got a story."
2,"Hard to get into. Starts of slow, but never gets better.","I was forced to read this book for tweflth grade English and frankly, it sucks. First chapter is really long, boring, and dragged out. I do not recommend this for younger readers."
