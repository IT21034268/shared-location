1,Get the one that looks like a star,We have had both these crayons and the Alex bath crayon that looks like a star. Other reviews that say these fall out of the holder are right and it totally defeats the purpose of getting in the tub to get clean. Get the ones that look like a star because the yellow plastic middle allows them to draw without getting it on their hands.
3,Hard to clean,The crayons do not stay in the holder very well & you have to use some elbow grease to wipe it off the tub. It's also pretty tough to scrub off of a toddlers face.
2,Threw Them Away,"Each crayon comes in a plastic holder. Each crayon fell OUT of the plastic holder immediately, leaving my child unable to hold onto them. After putting them back together several times (in one bath), I finally just threw them away."
1,AWFUL tub crayons!,"These are just horrible... Let's see... They only write on dry surfaces, and the color bleeds at the mere drop of water. Water easily disintegrates the color, but you end up with smeary, color-stained water running down your tub. In my case it ran down the side OUT of the tub and got into my floor grout and stained it blue. As I was trying to clean it up, I got some of the dye on my hands, and many hand-washings later they're STILL stained blue! I can't believe they're not even washable! I've used 2 different colors with my daughter, and she was frustrated because the crayons kept falling out of the holders, and the pieces themselves are way too slippery/small for tiny hands to hold on to. She seemed excited about using bath crayons in general, so I will try another brand, but AVOID THESE!"
2,Don't Work,"Gee, these bathtub crayons work great WHEN THEY'RE DRY, as in NOT IN THE BATHTUB! We used another brand of bathtub crayons before, and they work great. These, not so much."
1,"A Moldy, broken mess...","Bought these for my son for Christmas. After a week (only 2 baths!) all the crayons had come out of the protective sleeves and were broken. One piece fell down the drain and now our drain is clogged. The rest were MOLDY after the first week, so we tossed them. I assumed all bath tub crayons were the same. They are not. I would not buy these, I would not recommend them for anyone."
1,Dissolving,"Good idea, and yes they wipe off easily, but they break easily and if they fall in the water they melt. Day 2 and they are almost gone."
1,Terrible bathtub crayons,"We have had many bathtub crayons, and there is a wide range of quality out there. These are some of the worst we have used.These are quite water soluble and ""melt"" all over the place. They don't write very well at all. And after a short time, the crayon part falls out of the plastic holder.So - do yourself and your kids a favor and try a better brand."
1,"Don't waste your money, buy Crayola instead","I bought these yesterday for my son to play with and they are totally awful!Here are the things that are wrong with this product:1) They don't write on the walls when the tiles are wet (pointless as ""bath"" crayons)2) The crayons fall out of the ""sleeve"" when they are in the water.3) The duck ""eraser"" started falling apart after the first use.I have used Crayola brand ones before and they are much better and also cheaper! Those lasted me for more than 6 months. The Alex ones I just bought yesterday are almost worn out and we just used them once. What a complete waste of money.I also noticed that nowhere on the box does it ever say ""non-toxic"" which leads me to believe that these crayons may not be safe for my child.I will never buy these again."
3,don't expect these bath crayons to last long,I believe that they lasted through about three baths and then were all dissolved. I don't think that I will be buying this brand again.
2,ehh,I have a 2 year old and she loves to color so I bought these. They work fine except they do fall out of the holders and they are hard to clean off the tile unless you scrub. The darker colors stain her skin so once she is done playing we have to wash all over. I would never buy these again.
2,Not worth it!,"These crayons are not worth the investment! They fell out of the holders on the first use. They break very easily. Once they have fallen out of the holders, they do still work however if they rest on the side of the tub, they create a mark and run easily. If the holders worked, they would be a much better purchase."
1,These suck.,I didn't read any reviews of these - I just wanted to get some tub crayons for my 2-year-old and I think these were the cheapest ones that were prime eligible. I'm not sure what the purpose of the holder is - they should've just made the crayons a little fatter and they'd work great. The crayons themselves are super skinny and only last a couple of baths. I definitely don't recommend them.
1,The Crayons Crumble,"I never write reviews but just had to take a few minutes to express my complete dissatisfaction with this product. My toddlers used it one time and, when we tried to use it again the next day, the crayons had become a huge crumbling mess! There were crayon chunks all over the bath tub, as the crayons disintegrated before our very eyes. What a complete waste of money. It's not terribly expensive but a complete waste nonetheless."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!!,"My wife and I bought these for our daughter ( 14 months ) to play with in the tub.... First when we got them we were surprised at how SMALL they really are... and these things dont even fill up the whole holder the come in, not at all like how big they look in the pictures... Second, they WOUND NOT stay in the holder during the bath... they fell out and would not go back in, no matter what we tried. TAKE MY ADVISE, DONT WASTE YOUR TIME NOR YOUR MONEY ON THESE THINGS"
3,Beware the Purple!,"My son loves to color with these in the bath. Yes, they do not stay in the holders, but it's really easy to pop them out, and the sticks are still long enough without the holder for kids to have fun drawing with them. I love this set because it comes with a duck clean-up sponge - my son has just as much fun with the sponge as he does with the colors.That said, BEWARE THE PURPLE!!! All the other colors come off tile/tub/shower surfaces with a quick swipe of the sponge, but the purple just fades. My tub is now covered in light purple markings despite having scrubbed it several times. I now throw that color away the minute I get a new package of ""crayons""."
2,Tub Crayons,"I like that your child can draw in the tub but the crayons are constantly falling out of its holder. They do not hold well and I have already lost quite a few crayons down the drain. For the amount you spend on the actual item and then shipping, you are better off going to a store to purchase this item."
1,Dissolved in the tub!,The other reviews are correct in stating that the crayons don't stay in the holders that they come with. Fine. We took them out. I gave my son two and I took one for myself so I could show him how they work. I wrote his 6 letter name on the side of the tub and the crayon was half gone! They crayons were dissolving in the water! What a waste of money. Fortunately I had also purchased the Crayola tub markers. Those are much more durable.
1,GET A DIFFERENT BRAND,"Tub crayons are a great toy for the bath, but these ones are smaller than they appear, and less durable than other brands."
3,Seems overpriced ...,"I can't speak about the actual use of these crayons since they were a gift but I know that they were very well received. My only gripe (if you can call it that) is that these seem awfully overpriced for what you get. The packaging does not look impressive at all. Again, this doesn't matter to 99% of the people reading this (who are planning on buying these for their own kids) ... but it might help those considering giving this as a gift :)"
1,Mushy horror,"We adored our original shower crayons (I think Crayola), so we bought these foolishly thinking them to be similar. They are absolutely not. Not only do they fall easily from their holders, but they retain water and thus are swiftly reduced to a mushy paste after a few uses. This makes pushing the crayon up in the holder impossible, as the plunger rising only mushes the crayon out of the front slit instead of pushing it out the top.Absolutely cannot recommend. Try any other brand first."
3,On our second set,"My grandkids love these crayons. They are 9 and 3. They get over their disappointment with the holders right away. I toss the holders after the first bath. The big kid draws and the little one wipes it away.I wish, like other reviewers, for more crayon and NO holders!"
5,One of Handel's little known MASTERPIECES,"All of this CD is fabulous, but the main reason I bought this CD was to own Handel's Anthem for the Foundling Hospital. The first time I heard this piece (on the radio), I had to stop driving and just listen. The words and music are incredibly touching, encouraging us with the blessings God promises to those who ""consider the poor and needy"". Handel himself set the example by writing this piece for a benefit concert for a foundling hospital. If you love Handel's music, you simply must get a copy of Anthem for the Foundling Hospital. You will not be disappointed."
1,Absolutely Awful,"I appreciate a good romance. I love supernatural fiction. I was very pleased to see someone trying to merge the two.Unfortunately, Raliegh is simply not a good enough writer to have attempted this project. Her protagonists are obnoxiously perfect, and the supernatural plot ludicrous. In Raleigh's prologue, she tells us that vampires of the world have evolved beyond their bloodthirsty past. So where is the rationale for a ""vampire"" hero who doesn't actually need blood? The plot involves a magical amulet which was divided into parts and sent, for safekeeping, to three ""maidens."" Why not leave it with the oh-so-perfect vampires? And that ""heroine"" -- bleah.Every line is over-written, hyperdramatic, and childish. I can sympathize that the author was dealing with an unfamiliar mixing of genres, but there is no excuse for this tawdry, sophomoric hackwork. Grade: F."
3,Guardian Vampires,"I enjoyed this book and cheered on our hero and heroine to the finish. I liked the conflict that the two main characters had to overcome. I liked that there was a mystery surrounding the heroine (though do not read the back cover of the book, if you want the mystery revealed in its proper place- HUGE Spoiler on the cover). I liked the conflict with the antagonist. I can even accept this interesting take on vampires living by choice in a parallel world and that utopic existence being threatened by evil (Garden of Eden stuff) what I found disappointing was that the vampires were very divorced so far from Vamp legend. The antagonist vamp seems to be the closest to the concept, but there is not a huge offering of traits beyond what a human would exhibit.The romance is gentle with no flagrant sex. As I hinted to above, this is not a horror either."
4,my lord vampire,"I thought that this book was wonderful. I did, however, get lost a few times. The over use of a few words did drive me mad for the most part. But overall I found the book to be a wonderful read and very vivid. I will soon read the next two in the trillogy. I am dying to find out what happens hehehe"
5,magnificent pictures,"Toru Ando , a professional photographer, spent thirteen years taking pictures of the cherry trees. He travelled a lot to search for the finest bloom and the old trees.Many pictured trees are several hundred years old and are really majestic.Japanese families enjoy picnics in the shade of the blooming chery trees.So one can see lots of people celebrating the arrival of spring. In this book you will find only the pictures of the trees, with no people fussing around.The trees are only for you!The tree location and the full blooming date is presented, so you can schedule your trips to see the live tree.The bloomings are shown in detail, so you will notice the delicate colours and the diference between species.You may feel the flower petals falling silently like pink rain.You may understand the fragility of life amidst the universe."
5,Voice of an Angel,"I have loved the voice of Renata Tebaldi for 50 years but I mainly listen to her operatic recordings. For me she has always been the greatest of all Verdi heroines, surpassing Callas and Milanov whom I also admire.It is only recently that I became aware of her repertoire of religious music. Listening to this selection has caused me to admire her voice even more. In fact her rendition of ""Silent Night"" is one of the most beautiful and moving that I have ever heard. Truly, in the words of a contemporary conductor she had the voice of an angel."
4,Big Bars Last A Long Time!,"The bars are bigger than normal and may be difficult for small hands (kids) to grasp. The scent is light (for me) and isn't noticeable after the shower. Be sure to keep it in a place where it can dry properly or else the edges get gooey/mushy. Use it knowing that Kiss My Face is an animal-free and cruelty-free company, my main reason for purchasing the product."
4,Good soap but wish it smelled a little better,"I like this soap and use it all the time but prefer the smaller bars. The smell could be a little better but I still like it. It cleans well and is biodegradeable, very important for the septic tank. One of the few biodegradeable soaps that gets you really clean."
2,Nothing Special,"If your looking for good ole Black Metal, check out Blut Aus Nord's other album - The work Which Transforms God.This album is basically the same mode and repetition. Terrible recordings that have very little resemblence to anything Black Metal.All I listen to is experimental music and styles that are generally difficult and draining for the amount of concentration required, but this album was only draining in low grade repetition.No offense to the band what so ever, just didn't feel this album at all."
2,Horrible sound quality,"I am so sad to say how disappointed I was with the quality of this tape. Thich Nhat Hanh has so much wisdom to share, but this tape was frustrating to listen to, between the muffled tone and the audience coughs, laughs, and sneezes. I hate to say it, but this deserves a pass, especially considering the content is good....if you can hear it."
5,Invaluable,"This is the best book I've ever read on the subject of structure and craft. I read it several years ago and am still using ideas I gained from it. I don't really think that anybody can learn to write from reading a book on writing, but I do believe that those, like me, who write for a living day after day need the wisdom and inspiration of really fine writers like Jon Franklin. The annotated text for his feature story on brain surgery is worth a college course."
2,More better elsewhere ...,"Franklin's book make me queasy; the thing is just so much hackwork, and the stories he takes apart -- his own two Pulitzer prize winners -- are kind of poorly, blahly done. They just don't have the impact JF thinks they have. I don't know what the P judges were thinking; maybe the competition was exceedingly weak. In any event, Franklin's work probably would have a difficult time getting published today -- at least in a magazine it would -- for it seems amateurish and underboiled. A far better book (despite its title) is How to Write like a Pro, by Barry Tarshis: it's a pleasure to read and is far more sophisticated in all regards than Franklin's little puddle. It's out of print, however, so you'll need to do some sleuthing to track it down. But I assure you, it's well worth the effort, and it WILL improve your writing skills."
5,Excellent Book!,"Most books about the craft of writing contain a compendium of technique, but they fail to provide the instruction to effectively apply that technique. This book, however, provides both the technique and the instruction for the application of that technique."
3,Highlights To Tell You What's Significant About This Book,"Complication: Cancer strikes Josie. Resolution: Josie overcomes cancer. Complication leads to action, leads to resolution. Significant expenditure of physical and psychological energy.Character: A character has a past history, has a condition, has a point of view.First attempts at resolution: what are they? Why does he make these attempts and not others?A happy ending is what is most wanted by most readers today.This is a book useful only to beginners."
5,Verle Helsel's thoughts,"I joined a writer's group to provide the opportunity and incentive to write. The writer's group is my simulator where I can flight test what Jon's book teaches me about the skill of writing. Good combination. The admonition to ""just start writing and it will come to you"" doesn't make sense to me. I am familar with what it takes to build a skill. There are slow ways, fast ways, good ways, and it takes forever ways. What I want is a good fast way. I am 80 years old. I don't have a lot of time. Good writing requires that I know what good writing is when I see it. Jon helps me do this. This helps me track my progress. Continue to learn from the masters like Jon. Spend as much time as possible in the simulator (writer's group). Thank you, Jon."
5,Best book on writing that I ever read,"I read a lot of books on writing, recently I read-"" Inside reporting, A practical guide to journalism"". Excellent book!In there -it recommended, Writing for the story, Jon Franklin. I loved the book, I am trying to write a novel and the book has helped me with outlines, with tension and style. Also, it helped me with pacing, imaging and way too many tips to include in my review. I read it once. I will read it again this time , more carefully and with more focus.I recommend this book because it will help you write an interesting short story, a novel and non-fiction story. By the way, anyone interested I also read How to write a breakout novel. Not bad but this one is definitely better.I just wished, Jon wrote a follow up to this one, maybe more advance."
5,great series overall,"This was a great series overall, but I was a little disappointed that HBO chose to end it after only 2 seasons. The actual history is so complex and interesting that it could have gone on for several seasons. However, I am happy to have at least had two. True history buffs will likely be disappointed at the use of creative license the writers used, however, the major points of the history are there (and since it's been a few years since this series aired, all of that nit-picking is over and done with). This is a series that I've watched several times since it first aired and will be one that I'll come back to view every few years."
5,Great Product,"Rome, seasons 1 & 2 is perhaps the greatest historical drama of all time. i have a dgree in Classics, and I must say, nothing else even comes close to making a real attempt to display the daily lives, relationships and paradigm, of ancient Rome. Superbly casted, directed, acted, shot, costumed... Visually stunning! Don't miss it!!!"
5,Oh. My. God.,"The most awesome series EVER. Titus Pullo continues to amaze, Octavian comes into his own, Lucius Vorenus shows a whole new side. I'm not sure how much I can say without giving it all away... Antony is still unbelievably hot, and Atia is evil as ever. A must-see for anyone remotely interested in ancient Mediterranean history or culture."
4,Good product,We have really enjoyed this product and would recommend this seller. The product matched well with the description.
4,Contemporary and archaic,I had not watched this series on TV. A friend recommended this to me and I am glad he did. The presentation is lucid and intriguing. The contemporary language does not take away the feel of this being a 2000 year old story. The cast is very good and so are the sets. Thoroughly enjoyed this.
4,Rome Season 2,I really enjoyed watching the second season. I couldn't stop until it was over. Made me wish there were more episodes.
4,ROME - Season II,"Both Season I and II were well done with characters, costumes, mores, settings and plots that were appropriate. The whole effect was absorbing. My preference is to buy and watch a season by nightly episodes, rather than wait for the weekly episodes on HBO.There was talk of a Season II - it never materialized, nor was it needed."
4,Rome II,I purchased this as a gift to my grandson. It came promptly and I delivered it to him for Christmas. I have a note from him thanking me and saying he enjoyed it.
3,All the pagentry,"We loved season one. While I was still impressed by season two, I didn't think it quite met the same standard. I was also disappointed that this was the end. I mean come on, with a title reflecting over a thousand years of history filled with intrique, murder, betrayal, sex, greed, money, and the death of jesus; how do you quit after two seasons."
2,MISSING DISC,"I absolutely love Rome, great series and I can't complain about it.However, I received the second season as a gift around Christmas of 2008. I didn't actually open the disc set until about April or May of this year. When I opened it, I noticed I had two Disc 2's but no Disc 4. I thought maybe is was a mislabel, but when I played both the discs, they were exactly the same.I've made many attempts to get ahold of someone at HBO to get a replacement disc, new set, or something, but I've gotten no response, not even a canned answer e-mail. HAS ANYONE ELSE HAD THIS PROBLEM? IF SO, HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO GET IT FIXED???[...]Thanks,Xandra D"
4,Rome #2,"Great show. Great acting. Great casting. The younger actors in this season were not as believeable and were the older actors in season #1. But I really liked it just the same. And again, to bloody bad it was cancled."
5,Absolutely faboulous.,"Although this season was not as good as the first, it still retains all the suspense and drama. All of the characters come back, with the exception of Niobe and Caesar, and all of them experience a drastic personality change as the historic events unfold. A few of the mid-season episodes can get a bit slow, but once Octavian takes over, the games definitely begin."
5,More Rome!,"Second season is just as good, same great sets, and acting. I only wishit went on and on!"
2,Battles of Network T & A,"When I reviewed Rome The First Season I raved and said I couldn't wait for the second season. Well, the second season fulfilled that old saying about 'being careful what you wish for'. The second season had the high production values, the violence, and the sex - but little else. The story shoots off into wildly inaccurate and implausible directions, especialy concerning Atia. The men, particularly the great general Marcus Agrippa are portrayed as weak-kneed boys who are manipulated by the wicked wily women.No, it's not University, but the first season proved that they could produce riveting TV with plenty of salacious details and violent action without mutilating the history part. The Second Season is mostly a vheicle for a lot of bedroom romps by Atia and others, not altogether a bad thing, but what a disappointment after such a promising first season. It reminded me of the old SNL skits about the Battle of Network T&A;."
2,Disappointed,I was extremely disappointed with the 2nd season. As far as I could see it was a repeat of the 1st season - to the point of the same ending. I loved the 1st season and was taken with the characters. I feel as though the 2nd season was a waste of my time and money.
2,2.5 stars due to same nonsense as Rome 1..except even more lacking in substance,"This movie? series has gotten a lot of rave reviews..and it does have nice actors, actresses, acting and lots of nice scenery , background scenery & costumes in movie..and has had a lot of money spent on it. (that i will not argue). The storyline however is lacking in substance and historical context and seems to be more like an elaborate graphically violent and ""sexy"" soap opera..( lots of gorey violence and graphic sex scenes). you will see people being killed or tortured or sexed in the most horendous, graphic ways every 30 minutes it seems of the movie. Sex, violence..and nice background scenery, costumes of Rome...acting is good ..but the storyline is what really is the problem. IT is not a historic docu drama...but an elaborate made for cable TV soap opera.Also..if anyone cares to comment...WHERE IS THE ENDING? IT JUST ENDS.? HOW?"
5,Rome Season 2,My husband had to have it add to his collection. The product arrived in a timely manner as promised. Amazon is our source for all DVD boxed set purchases. Highly recommend them.
4,Rome better than you could imagine,"Just sorry this series had to end after only 2 seasons. The production values are exceptional and expensive and the stories classic and compelling. They messed a bit with timelines and history but overall it is great experience for fans of Ceasar, Augustus and Roman history. Definitely for adult viewers though- I thought it was very entertaining and the acting was brilliant."
5,TRY DONATING A DAY OF YOUR LIFE TO ROME,"This last weekend I gave a day to watching both seasons of the colossal series ROME. Taken in one really big bite its impact is amplified, which is something for such a larger-than-life epic. It also helps keeping track of the many many-layered characters, the entwined stories and all the eye-goggling visuals. Well worth the delayed sleep; try it.Now I'm considering waiting a few months and see it, end-to-end again. I expect to see new things, make some connections to contemporary politics and appreciate the fine production qualities from our superb English friends."
4,Great series,Love this show. Too bad it came to an early end. The final episodes of season 2 are a bit rushed to say the least.
4,Not a bad continuation of the series,"I agree with some reviewers that said this was a little too much like a historical soap opera and too little like a real drama. But I did find it interesting and entertaining, which is I think what the producers were aiming for. A funny note though, while they advertised the first season in my college history dept. I did't see any posters for the second. I'm thinking either it was too graphic re the sex and violence, or maybe they didn't think it was ""historical"" enough."
5,I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!BEST SHOW EVER!,"I have both of the seasons and I can watch them over and over again and I never get sick of it!I'm a huge fan of Roman history and this show is very close to how everything actually happened.Its very true to the real history.I also loved how graphic this show is sexually and violently.If you have a passion for Roman history like I do,learning about it or reading about it or watching movies and shows about it then this is definitely a must see show!!!!!"
4,Second season is second fiddle to First,"Maybe I had been spoiled by the First Season of Rome, but I thought the Second was lacking in historic reality and more based in peripheral character development like Atia's overstayed visit. I know she was Octavian/Augustus' mother, but she was a real person and I thought the show portrayed her as fictitious ""filler material"". I was more interested in seeing Cleopatra and Antony and the battle of Actium on the sea - a battle Octavian should have lost.Augustus was barely even in this season yet he was far more famous and beloved than Julius was. He was the first Emperor of Rome yet he was more - I thought - in ""cameo mode"" throughout the season.I gave this 4 stars so I don't intend to tear this season down. I don't know what I was expecting, but over all it was very well done also. Maybe its because I put 3 years into actually getting around to the Second season after I bought the First. Not as good as the First, but its no slouch."
5,"Outstanding Series, but the Axe was obvious","For the first few episodes of season 2, history was followed for the most part. Then it was announced that series would not be renewed. So, they had to change their game plan. The pace of the events was on Fast Forward after Mutina. They could not pace out the story lines like they could in Season 1. But I LOVE this series, and I can't wait for it to come out on DVD. HBO did a disservice to its subscribers by cancelling this show."
5,"OK, I'm biased.","Maybe I am biased, but I love fiction that has a historical basis, and in my opinion, it doesn't get any better than ROME. Having seen the first season, I was desperately waiting for the next season to come out and it did not disappoint one bit. The conflict between Mark Antony and Octavian is the main focus of this season and ends with the final battle between the two. At times, Rome can inspire awe, surprise, shock, disgust, exhilerate, often simultaneously. You may love or hate this series, but you certainly cannot ignore it."
3,Poor recording quality,"Series was good, but the discs we received were poor quality - many skips and lost scenes."
5,Very good HBO series,"Do there is major innacuracies historically, in general the story line is exact. What i most like in this hbo series is that the producers and directors give you a very very good sense of what Rome must of seem like and of all the movies I've seen on Rome the feel of this one is the best. Do some of the violent scenes are some times raw and even the sexe ones, they as well, truly portray a society that didn't have are judeo-christian values and that we must not forget when looking at these scenes...."
5,You won't be disappointed,I have Season One and highly recommend Season Two! I don't have HBO so couldn't wait to purchase once on sale and was not disappointed. Highly exciting-
5,Brilliant Analysis,"Make no mistake, this is a dense book and a slow read. It's worth the time and effort, however, because the reader emerges with a refreshingly new perspective on the international system. The premise is that conflict between states is predictable based on where each state sits on its relative power continuum. Each state follows a bell-curve of sorts in terms of its power relative to the international community. At a handful of tension points along that curve, a state is significantly more likely to experience confict with other states. It's a fascinating tool, and one that holds up to numerous applications.I highly recommend this text to any serious student of international relations. More casual readers may not be willing to put in the time; coincidentally, though, those same casual readers will likely be put off by the clunky title."
2,A poorly sequenced mishmash of tracks.,"This one smacks of a label's desperation to just slap together a compilation without any thought as to how best to present the artists' work. Avoid this one! Instead, buy Cheap Trick (1997), their most fully realized studio album, or At Budokan or Music For Hangovers to hear one of the Top Five live acts of the rock era do what they do best."
3,"Great cover, from the back (what should have been the front) of The Doctor LP w/JB",Nice little compilation from 1987and burned onto CDs back in 1995following CT's disasterous W.U.W.A.M.Not bad for the price. Bought it downhere in Virginia at Planet Music. JBRocks! Look soon for 'Rockford' by CT.
5,WONDERFUL!,"I didn't realize that this cd contained two albums on one disc. The Jasmine album I heard on LP years ago. It was a great experience to re-live this music and to hear the VINCE MARTIN album as well, which I had not heard before. I really enjoyed the music immensely."
5,Best Young Adult Book Written!,"I believe that this book has been one of the best written young adult books ever! The author is very talented and seems to know how to grab the attention of an audience, young and old! I love how he can write a whole book full of journals from characters he's made up and make it sound as if it were from actual students! This book really shows his passion for understanding and communicating with his students! Good Luck on your future books Tate Thompson! You're going to go far as an author, you are a great writer!"
5,Fresh New Style,"Welcome to the real world! This book is perfect for readers looking to capture a sense of what our students experience during a typical year of high school. If your tired of the typical Brady Bunch moral lessons, take the time to read this book. It presents the real problems and situations that teens encounter. Times have changed, but unfortunately writing styles seem to be progressing at a much slower pace. Tate Thompson exhibits an amazing ability to identify with teens and their struggles. I highly recommend this book. Hopefully Mr. Thompson is working on a sequel."
2,No classroom I have ever been in,"My mom sent me this book to read and at first I thought the concept was intriguing, then I began reading it. I have never been in any classroom where students have seen a teacher in the light that this author apperently saw himself in. It is an unrealistic depiction of high schooler's thoughts and reactions to the situations in which they were placed. It is also rather offensive to me as a twenty something female that such negative terms were used throughout this book, and I highly doubt that any female would write such things in a journal that was to be read by a male teacher. The writing itself was very hollow, and it seems like this author is a big fan of tooting his own horn. I would not reccomend this book to anyone who is looking to get insight into a ""typical"" high school classroom, this is like no classroom I have ever been in."
5,Jill's reveiw,"I really liked the book senioritis because it really related to real life situations and showed people that they are not the only one that feels teachers are against them. Also that it shows how different people are different and how different races feel about different situations. I also liked how every character had their ""voice"" as it would be in real life it was like Tate Thompson new each character as an individual."
2,"This is a replacement for the NB-1L, not the NB-1LH.","This battery is rated at 3.6V, 750mAh and is considered to be a replacement for the NB-1L. The new Canon cameras come with the NB-1LH, which is 3.7V, 840mAh. I guess since it was a ""New Item"" with no picture yet, I assumed it would be the newer battery. This older battery works fine with the camera, but will result in shorter battery life than the NB-1LH."
3,the battery is the matter.....,"This product is good in size and weight when you carry it, but the battery is kinda weak....I've had this product only few months but always showing low battery after you shoot about 15 pictures in standard res. (which means it makes no sense to use a 128MB flash card with this camera). I am thinking to get a spare battery or just buy the other one?..."
1,It runs out too soon.,"I purchased this battery as a back up for my Cannon NB-1LH Battery Pack but it ran out so quick within one hour. If you're looking for a back up battery for your camera, please don't buy this one. You will be very disappointed."
2,Battery runs out too soon,Don't buy it because of the low price; it's not worth the money.Buy the much longer lasting pack from Canon (NB-1LH).
1,Don't buy this battery,"I bought this battery because it claims to be compatable with the Canon S330 camera. We'll the battery doesn't fit the camera without shoving it into the camera, which will probably result in long term damage to your camera. Stick with pure Canon products."
3,clunky but good,"I was looking for a chess game for the MAC, and bought this. It's a redo of an older version so don't look for any cutting edge AI or grfx here, but all in all it performs well and can be very challenging."
5,Life Changing,After hearing Gregg Braden speak I ordered three of his cds thinking that his books would be harder to read for me. I ordered this cd and the language of god and the healing cd. They all kind of interlap each other with some of the same info but are all excellent. If I could only buy one cd it would hands down be this one. I have it in my car and I have listened to it over and over again for over a month now. Love the message. I find it hard to change my way of prayer but I am working on it and finding the new way is bringing much sucess. He is a fabulous author and speaker and I feel so blessed to have had the opportunity to have heard him in person. His words have changed my life forever in a wonderful way.
1,The Lost Mode of Prayer,"This book is a bunch of garble-d-goop and talking in circles and not saying much of anything.The bible specificlly tells you how to pray. Nothing has been lost in the interpitation. The writers of the books of the bible were told by GOD to write it down and they did. GOD does not, and can not, lie.Where did this guy get his information on 45 (to HIS knowledge) lost books of the bible that were kept out of the interpetation because someone decided, in their vast wisdom, that we did not need them? There is no such thing, period.This information was created out of imagination, just like Mormonism and the Davidians and any other cult.If you would like the TRUTH about prayer, may I suggust writings by Hank Hanigraf, Luis Pulau, Billy Graham, or the author's of the books of the bible."
3,not totally happy but then again I was abusing it...,"I use it for my koi pond. When water gets low or when the filter gets clogged the automatic switch would go on and off every 15 seconds, which in itself is OK, but if that continues for days, like when I am out of town or simply being my lazy self, the switch gets stuck. I had to replace the switch with an older one from a broken pump that was bought quite a few years ago. You know, they just don't make things with quality parts like they used to in the old days... or maybe I should just remember to get by old butt off the sofa and clean the filter more often."
4,good lights,HAd these for a party...these are better than the chauvet mini line dancer...as they dont have to switched off in 15 mins ...also the shape is not exactly of a moonflower..but with fog these lights look good...not the best...but good enuff for a house party...has many color options which is great..too much hassle changing them..but i wud say they are nice once set..
4,1 Year Later...,"Pros: Bright, colorful, and cheap. This thing and a $20 fog machine does wonders for a party. It covers a large area with spinning colorful lights (just like the cheesy DJs have at weddings).It's much heavier than it looks. It's well built and feels very solid.Cons: High ceilings or giant rooms area a necessity. There is no ""zoom"" on the lens; meaning you cannot change how wide or narrow the light pattern is displayed. If you are planning on using this in a small room with a standard 8 ft. ceiling you will most likely not be able to cover the entire floor with the lights. When mounted in the corner of my 20'x25' living room I can only cover about 2/3 of the floor. I didn't even think about this before I bought it but it needs a lot of distance to fully spread out.Overall, I'm very happy with this product. My wife and I have used it half a dozen times and it's always a hit with our friends and family."
2,BAD SOUND,The movie sound was HORRIBLE. Had to literally turn it all the way up and it was barely audible.
1,coloring too dark,"This video has white vertical lines flashing throughout movie. The coloring is off also. The two baby bears are black, all you can see are white eyes. This same cartoon movie is on a ""Classic Christmas Cartoons"" compilation and it is perfect picture. The two baby bears are brown with tan coloring and is much better. Sorry to say I'm disappointed in this single dvd."
3,Which version has the best production quality?,I HAVE to find a good version of this - keep hearing about poor video and audio. Anybody find one that's of decent quality?
2,Old TV classic looked old,I had recorded this off the TV on VHS in the '80s. The quality of that VHS was better than the DVD I purchased
1,Not worth the money,I bought two of these locks. One of them broke the very first time it was used. The locking mechanism locked up rendering the unit totally inoperable. The second unit is still in service but the locking mechanism is very sloppy. If you leave the key in the lock in the locked position any vibration will cause the key to turn to the unlocked position. These locks are more like Cracker Jacks toys instead of locks. Very cheaply made and not very durable at all.
4,Works like it should,This lick is being used on our sliding window between reception and the lobby. I was concerned that it could be jimmied from the outside but try as I might I haven't been able to get through (unless its unlocked). Would definitely buy again.
1,Worthless,"This program conflicts with Office 2003, Acronis True Image, and (I assume) many more programs. Live Update crashes and hangs computer regularly, and many features of this program are disabled by cell phone providers. This product is cheezy to the extreme, aweful GUI, horribly slow Live Update downloads, I could go on and on. I paid $3 for it, and I am getting a refund. Don't even mess with it, trust me on this one..."
4,Classic!,Classical music has always been my root. I always go back to it for true solace and the renewal of my soul.
5,Wilts buddy Bob Kashey,"Great book. I loved every page except page 155. That Bob Kashey character can't be real. I know a Bob Kashey that hangs out at Chile's in Lake Mary, Florida and this can't be him although he keeps insisting it is. In any case, it is a great book, well worth the investment."
4,Somebody does love GOLIATH,"Wilt Chamberlain once said ""Nobody loves Goliath. I'm here to say that after reading ""Wilt, Larger than Life"" I refute that. The book gave an indepth look at not only Wilt the basketball icon, but Wilt the person. It explored relationships he established outside of basketball and how he maintained those frendships until his untimely death. After reading the book I also had more appreciation for Wilt the basketball player. I feel that not only was he one of the greatest players of all time, but he met and exceeded all of the expectations that were placed on him when he very well could and was in some cases viewed as a freak of nature."
1,What Happened?,"Their previous album, ""Recipe for Disaster"", was easily one of the best hard rock albums of 2005. However, I can not even recommend buying this album. The production sounds as if it was recorded on cheap audio gear in somebody's basement. The vocals a buried most of the time, and the low end is non-existent. The songs don't even sound like they are on par with RFD. Although, is hard to tell because the sound of the album is so horrible.Go see Brand New Sin live, they are awesome! And, let's hope they straighten out their production issues before their next release."
2,not the BNS i know...,"ok, i've been a fan of Brand New Sin since they debuted in 2002, witnessing over 4 BNS shows, including the recent tour with BLS, in which they OWNED! but this new cd to me just sounds...rushed? trying to move into a heavy direction, at some points in the cd there is too much going on, almost sounds cluttered at parts where the actual music is hard to follow, while Joe's Vocals in most of the cd is almost inaudible. while not an overall not a bad cd, but definetly not their best offering, those more interested in BNS, should check out their self titled cd, old school nasty hard rock. great stuff."
3,Pretty cool addition to an Xbox,The kids love it! Adds a really cool dimension to driving games and most games that have a soundtrack.
5,Phenomenal Voice,"A fantastic album that Brazilian friends of ours introduced us to. Her voice is incredible, and her track with Ben Harper really is divine."
1,Cleansing caution,"I highly recommend proceeding cautiously and consulting your physician before using this product. I bought it as a general cleansing regimen rather than for candida. The first night after starting the program was horrible. I was kept awake almost all night with very bad heartburn, stomach discomfort, and excitability -- as if I'd had too much coffee. I should point out that I am a health adult male, height to weight proportionate and have no pre-existing medical conditions or allergies. I plan to stick with the healthy diet I already follow and avoid these herbal treatment from now on."
1,Candida Supreme Vital Cleanse,"This ended up being a waste of my money because I couldn't take the product. One of the three products is a powder that you need to mix with eight ounces of warm water and drink in the morning. When you mix the powder in with the water, it immediately clumps as you are stirring, and the clumpy, powdery, grainy taste of this going down your throat is disgusting. I tried to swallow that mix for six days and then gave up; each time, I could not keep it down. It would have been much better if the powder came inside capsules. I would not recommend this to anyone."
2,confusing and overly violent,"Like many other reviewers, I felt that this book ultimately didn't reward the effort required to figure it out; although it started out in an intriguing way, the plot meanders more and more as the book passes the halfway point, and it becomes ever more difficult to identify with the characters. Also worth mentioning are two quite graphic rape scenes, neither of which seems vital to the plot in any way, and which represent a departure for Robson, who has avoided explicit sexual violence in her books to this point."
1,Look for other options,The blades on this slicer are too flimsy to stand up after even one or two uses. Slices come out uneven and sloppy looking because the blades are easily bent.
1,Worst design ever.,"The base doesn't stay put. The black plastic ""screws"" are hard to get into the wood, and they don't stay. The rack won't stay upright at all, even without DVDs on it. We'll be sending it back, it's rubbish."
4,Another Reason to Love Amazon Deals,Got PENUMBRA as a free book a week or so ago. It kept my interest with every page turn. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars was my slight disappointment with the ending. Characters were all realistic and easy to understand. I would recommend this book to any reader who likes fiction set in specific time frames of the past.
4,Best Incomplete Book,"I read this book several years ago as an Advanced Reader's Copy. I loved it from the very beginning to the end (although I thought the end of the book was lacking). I had never read anything by this author before and I hear that this book was actually a step away from her usual fare; I only wish that people had caught on to this one. I wanted there to be a sequel so bad that I kept looking for a follow-up for years. I hope that Haines does produce another book like this one. Hopefull with this new Kindle edition there will be a follow-up.If you liked The Help, you will love this book."
3,"good book, terrible ending","This was a great book til the end.. It ended too abruptly. Ms. Haines should write a sequel, Based on the ending I felt sure a sequel was in the plans . Good story, well developed characters, poor finish."
4,Loved It Until the Ending,"I have read a number of Carolyn Haines' novels, and I have loved them all. I really liked Penumbra, it kept me interested, and kept me reading wanting to know what would happen next, but like other reviewers, I found that the ending left me hanging. . . what happened to John Hubbard, what was going to happen to Jade? It just seemed like it ended so abruptly. I was hoping that maybe it ended this way because Ms Haines planned a sequel, but alas, as yet, I have not seen such. Anyway, I couldn't help but enjoy this novel, but I wish the ending had been a little bit more developed."
3,"Good, except. . .","This book was not at all what I expected! It was delightful, suspensful, mysterious! It was a definte page turner. The only thing it lacked was a better ending, I felt like it was premature way to end the story."
2,confusing ending,I liked this book up until I got to the end. I have no idea what the ending is suppose to be. Nothing came together. It`s as if the writer didn`t quite know how to bring the stories together and just gave up and ended to book. Very very dissapointing ending.. If there is no book 2 then I suggest the author comes out with a revised ending or something. I`m not inclined to read another one of her books. Sorry Carolyn I can`t recommend this novel.
3,just ok,"I got this book for free and was not expecting an amazing read. And it was not. The plot was interesting, but I found it undeveloped. Characters not developed. It was not bad, but just ok. The ending though I did like- unlike the other reviewers."
4,Intense & gripping,"Wow, this book was intense with such drama and scary truth in depiction of that time. I felt deeply for each of the characters. Thank you for showing such depth in each one of them."
2,Disappointed,"I enjoyed the intrigue of the book, but found the ending to be completely unsatisfactory. Without giving away the story, I had a hard time with John Hubbard at the end, and what Jade was going to do. A very interesting, suspenseful story, with a less than satisfactory ending."
2,Biased history,Dr. Thompsett is a competent historian but this work is not worthy of her standards. It leans too heavily on the '60s agenda and on a feminist viewpoint. She can do better.
3,great if not for the upskirts,"This had the making of a great anime, the storyline was great, the action was great, the characters were great, but for some very un-great reason the story is shot from an upskirt angle... No not just a little bit, a lot.. like as if the camera is stuck to multiple chicks knees just looking up. It didn't ruin this for me, but it's hard to sit down and watch what could have been a great anime, but is not because of some odd hentia upskirting director fetish. The producers must not have had much faith in their work. 5starts - 2 for the pantie shots. and they weren't even sexy, kinda just funny, then really annoying"
3,Najica Blitz Tactics Compete Collection,"Najica Blitz Tactics: Complete CollectionI really like this series. Very good action, good story and fan service. Just keep an open mind."
3,Nishijima loves panty very much,"I'm not sure why he loves white panty so much, but he loves indeed, he may have a certain reason =PThis anime is 'hommage' of AIKa, and this was JPN TV series. In Japan, erotic anime cannot be broadcasted, therefore I was surprised to watch this. (AIKa was sold-anime.) I heard, creators in Studio Fantasia thought so too, its very interesting (@_@)If also you love white panty, please watch this and wait new 3 episodes of 'AIKa R-16FVIRGIN MISSION' =D"
5,Need to know info...,"i need to know enough enfo about this CD... like the content & whther i can obtain it as a video CD as well, or if you have other video CD for the same singer ."
5,Wonderful songs,I don't know really what to write but all the songs are really wonderful. Hope the success for it.
5,A must for the merengue fan!,And Raul Acosta and Oro Solido do it again. The intoxicating rhythms and the humor in the lyrics make this record enjoyable and a great party starter. Kudos to Raul!
5,His best song,Het water is simply Marco Borsato's best song. Like the water that the lyrics talk about the music grabs the listener as it flows by.
4,World Map,"I LOVE that I found this map on Amazon! I had gone to a ""teacher store"" and the world map was priced at $23.00, so when I saw this at such a great price I was so excited! I also ordered the US Map. Both are a nice, big size and nice colors. I would've given it five stars except that I wish it was laminated."
5,Great map; reasonable price,"It came shipped well in it's original wrapping and in a long box. It's paper, but you can always frame it or get it laminated. It's perfect for little kids to read and it's a great piece of artwork you can hang in their room, too."
5,just what I wanted,"This came a few days after the last estimated arrival date, but other than that, it was in perfect condition (rolled gently in a hard tube)."
3,Nice Map,"This is a very nice map for the price. Good clear text and all the major cities. However, my only complaint is that it came flat in the mail. So there are creases every inch or so that I cannot get out. I suggest this should be shipped in a hard tube. Take your chances.-Dale"
5,world map,Excellent product!!! Received in a timely manner. Very professioally packaged. I would suggest this product for anyone wanting a world map.
5,Very colorful and easy to read,We bought this map to help our daughter learn her continents and countries. The map has a lot of detail without being too crowded with information.
1,World Map Review,"I recently purchased a paper world map from amazon and it arrived in very poor condition. The map was in a solid, cardboard tube which was not dented or damaged at all, but the map itself was rolled and covered in plastic and was bent and crushed in at several different areas. Obviously, this map was put into the cardboard tube damaged and just sent on without regard to the customer receiving it. We decided just to keep it and smooth it out as well as possible, because it wasn;'t worth the hassle to return a $3.00 map.Thanks"
5,World Rolled Map,"When I received the map, I was very very pleased. For under $6.00, I was not sure what I would receive. I work for a map company that does city and county maps. But I needed a world map for my grandson who is 13 and is going to St. Thomas this summer on a Boy Scout outing. I wanted to be able to show him where is was going and where it was located from his hometown.I would recommend this map for kids, teachers, parents and even companies. I could not be more pleased with the World Rolled Map and will probably order more in the very near future.Betsy"
5,Great map - wonderful value!,"Any map you can buy at a store that is halfway decent will run you at least $20. I was very surprised to find that to be the case as I was looking around before buying this one online.This map is beautiful, colorful, and not laminated. It sounds dorky, but I wanted a world map so that me and my husband could document with push pins all the places we've gone (we have a big trip planned this summer).It is perfect - a great size, and very attractive. This isn't something you'll wince at every time you see it hanging on your wall.Definitely recommend!"
1,Unsuitable for European DVD players,Unfortunately this MS collection is not compatible with European DVD players. The cover of the DVD actually tells you this as well as that it is 'not for sale or rent outside the US and Canada'. Save yourself a lot of trouble and don't buy this if you are from the EU!
5,Beyond Zero Point,This book/audio tape is incredible. Gregg Braden explains what we are all experiencing at this time and how to futher prepare ourselves for the shifts taking place. The information is based on scientific experiments as well. I am circulating the tapes among my friends and ordering more to send to others. This is information we all need to have.
3,Dated information,"At this point, a lot of this info is ""old news"" (2005)and for anyone who has read any of Gregg's other books, egThe Lost Mode of Prayer, the background info is very similar and repetitive.I'm sure when it first came out it was more impactful."
4,Stupid me,"Stupid me thought it was the book, which was what I wnated. This was an audio book and very well done. A lot of good points were made. Still I would have frather had the book."
5,Highly recommend for anyone interested in Homeopathy,"very comprehensive and highly informative, enjoyable to read, great cross reference and index, covers many species, gives details on indications for use and what to expect. Flowere essences can give be an effective solution for many pet owners who are struggling with behavioral problems Highly recommended ******"
5,Best Brahms Violin Concerto,"I think that the previous users who reviewed this cd with 5 stars well expressed how magnificent, intense and perfect is this live recording of both Brahms COncerto and Shumann Fantasie.So I decided to review the cd only to add a 5 stars vote!The most admirable thing of both pieces is for me the perfect union between orchestra and soloist: Mr Masur with the NYO let Mrs Mutter express all her formidable tecnique combined with her unique, marvellous, sense of interpretation.With this recording, all the previous will appear flat...The last thing I'd like to add is my happiness for the Shumann Fantasie: it's so a beautyful (and scary for the tecnique) piece but unfortunately it is so unusual as beautyful...There are no recordings of this undiscovered, brilliant and extremely difficult piece!So I recommend the Cd also for the performance of the Sh. Fantasie."
4,Disconcerting allegro,"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BA71B9GKL._SL75_.jpg While Mutter's violin work is masterful, exquisite, I found her very obvious pause in the famous early section of the allegro extremely disconcerting. I can't think of any other violinist who does this. It seems that, in order to ""claim"" a piece of music as their own, some famous musicians almost change the piece. Her allegro certainly isn't the way I think of it, or, I think, the way Brahms intended it. The orchestra is also not exactly united with her playing in sound quality."
4,Uneven Greatness,I have several CD's and vinyl versions of Brahm's violin concerto. Ms Mutter's playing of the finale is certainly up there with the best and better than many of her contemporaries. But the NY Philharmonic is not up to her at the beginning; its ponderous and muddy and has a lack of focus that I find distracting. She really shows what she is capable of only in the third movement. I find the Schumann insipid (in my opinion his greatest achievement was recognizing Brahm's genius). This is a concert recording and to be fair there was only one take of the Brahms - Oh if only she had played it with the fire in her earlier recording of the Sarasate Carmen Fantasy we would have spell binder - but she didn't. Acoustically there are better recordings out there. Artistically this is simply not her best work.
2,Hard to use,My 11 month old loves these (and has since she could first grab) but they do not work like they are designed. They are impossible for her to squeeze and they are hard for me to get them to connect and stay put. They are also a cleaning nightmare. They get very gross on the inside and I cant seem to ever get them clean. The directions tell you to drain them after each use but I can never get all the water out. If I can get them clean enough I will just stop using them in the bath.
3,Not squishy enough,These toys are hard to squeeze. I expected them to be softer so that my child could play with them on his own. However they are made of a harder plastic and he needs more strength in his hands to be able to do it on his own. I can barely squeeze them myself.
2,Too hard to keep clean,"My baby loved playing with these, but it's impossible to get the water out after bathtime. I eventually threw most of them away."
2,There's got to be a better bath toy,"They are cute, but it is time consuming to make sure all the water is out of each one of them so they don't mold. They don't really snap well together which was upsetting to a 20 month old and the day she learns how to actually squirt water out of the toys is the day I am done with them."
1,MOLDY = DANGEROUS,please don't buy these - after 2 months of use we started noticing black flecks in the water and realized later that it was mildew!
1,just plain bad,"please do not purchase these. i bought these for my son, who was 18 months at the time. he never played with them. they don't all link up, correctly, due to the fact that the parts on the toys aren't big enough to stick together. also, some of them don't squirt at all. i finally threw them away 6 months later after waiting for him to play with them, which he never did."
1,Too hard,We were very disappointed by these. The plastic is very hard and almost impossible to squeeze. Then once you manage to get some water in there it just dribbles back out. Would not recommend to anyone.
3,"Cute, but not as expected","I got these cute tub toys for my 1 year old. They are very cute and she loves toting them around and chewing on them, but they don't squeak like I expected bath toys to do (though they aren't described as squeaking) and how they 'snap' together, is not as expected, either. They link at strange places (some on arms, others on heads, etc) and some of the pieces are easy to link, but don't stay and others are hard for even my husband and me to link and still don't stay very well. So, it's not as if you could make a chain of these toys. They're cute, but I'm not sure I'd buy them again or give them as a gift."
2,:(,This item looked cute and was advertised as bath squirt toys that snap together. The snap together feature worked well but the toys were too stiff and hard to squeeze especially for a 6 month old. I returned this item and bought something else.
2,Mold stays inside of the toys.,"Cute bath toys, but the mold stays inside the toys. Very dificult to clean. The water doen't come out easily."
2,Unsanitary,"I bought these for the bath, and my son likes them (especially the little crab). They are ok as small toys, but I will not use them in the bath, because they are hollow and have a hole in them so you can fill them up and then squirt water out of them. The problem is that the hole is designed so that you can never get all of the water out, they constantly have water sitting in them. I think it is unsanitary and the sitting water will cause bacteria to grow, and there is no easy way to clean them out (except maybe boiling and squeezing them to fill them with the boiling water??) But you would have to boil them after every bath. I prefer to get toys that can dry thoroughly between baths."
3,Not pleased,"I coulnt find many bathe toys out there and this one seemed the most popular but after the first couple of bathes, I was terribly disappointed. The toys pick up a lot of water and they are not easy to squeeze out so the water stays in there and turns into black mold. Its so disgusting because my little one either tries to suck on it or the black mold gets into the tub. Looking for a better alternative."
2,Great toy - but not for water,"My grandson is almost 1. He has loved playing with these for about 6 months. They don't snap together well, so he gets frustrated with that, but likes to carry around the octopus. I learned early that they are not good in bath. They don't squirt because they are a harder plastic. In really hot water they are squishable, but then its too hot for baby. Plus, you can't get the water out when bath is over - even if you shake and shake, there's still a little water in them. I would buy it again, but it shouldn't be listed as a bath toy."
2,Another negative review,"I agree with what many other posters have discussed. The plastic is much too hard for a bath squirter. They don't actually squirt very well, and certainly not when squeezed by a little preschooler's hand. And water sits inside them, allowing mildew to build up easily. They are cute, and the snap together feature is fun, but I think Sassy tried to serve too many purposes with the design. Bath squirter FAIL."
2,"Cute and Colorful, but very awkward.","First of all, the item pictures shows twice as many as you really get. you only get 8, i was expecting more. they fit together in a very odd way, and young children will have a difficult time figuring out how exactly which part goes in which as well as actually pushing them together. they're sturdy but the hard plastic is tough for even my 3 yr old to push together. its really awkward. these are nothing like the beads that are for regular play which are a harder plastic and its easy for a baby to figure out which part goes into which.also you have to worry about the black mold/mildew that collects when you have bath toys like this. they cannot properly dry after use and this nasty stuff collects and there isn't any real good way of cleaning it out."
2,yuck! mold,"My baby loved these. And so did I - until I discovered all the disgusting mold inside of them. I squirted the water out after each bath, rinsed them, and let them dry, but they still molded."
5,These are the best bath toys ever!,"Buy these toys! I purchased the same set in a store and my son carried them around FOREVER! He took them to bed, used them in the bath, everywhere. I had to throw out the old ones because they got moldy inside. Other than the mold, which is inevitable, they are the perfect little toy set!"
2,Cute but you can never get them dry,"The little characters are really cute and my son loves them. However, most of the characters are hard to squirt and pretty much impossible to get all of the water out. My son also couldn't really push the characters together to link them. I had bought this at a store and didn't see the reviews until I was looking for a new bath toys :(The two stars are for being cute and having the hanging bag, which could be reuse for other bath toys."
4,Perfect for the baby pool,Very simple small animals. My 10 month old son loves to play with them in his pool outside!
2,Fun...but fill with mold/mildew,"We got these for our son for Christmas, and he has really enjoyed them. On a few occasions, they have left the bath and traveled around the house with him. After noticing some color changing, I cut one of the less used animals in half to find mold/mildew had grown in the toy. We quickly tossed the discolored toys in the trash. I would consider repurchasing these toys, but will not be planning on using them as bath toys."
3,"Okay, not great","My 3 yr. old son and his little sister received these as a gift. They are bright and colorful, but a little too hard for their little fingers to squeeze. Some are better than others. I even have trouble with the coral piece. They still enjoy them, but its a bit less interactive and more me spraying them."
1,They don't squirt -- munchkin ones much better,"These are very difficult for an adult to squeeze, and therefore impossible for a baby. This means they can't squirt them and you can't empty the water out of them. They don't work very well as snap beads either. Go with the Munchkin squirt toys, they are very soft and easy to squirt (and teethe on)."
3,cute but don't fit well together,"they are cute, but they don't fit well together. you need some force to fit them and they defenatly are not for squirting. almost impossible for a child to squeeze the force required to squirt."
2,They fill up with mildew,"They are cute, and our son loves them, but no matter how hard we tried to keep them clean and dry, they fill up with mildew that eventually squirts out with the water.As other reviewers said, they do not snap together very well, and some of them to not squirt very well."
2,can't get water out,"My kids like playing with these, but some of them I can't get all of the water out of after they are done playing. I don't like the idea of stagnant water staying in there and molding."
3,Snap & Squirt Sea Creatures,"They are cute, colorful, and baby loves them. But some of them are very hard and do not really ""squirt"". Also, they don't snap together so well."
5,better used out of the tub!,"these are okay in the tub and i agree with the stagnant water problem but... outside of the tub they ROCK! my 9 month old loves these- we take them everywhere. she chews on them, throws them, jabbers at them and they kept a week-long vacation interesting for her and still do. a great value for the price."
1,Too hard to clean,"My 1-year-old son loves these toys. . . BUT they are way too hard for him to squeeze and the water just stays inside the toys and gets really moldy. There were black rings around the outsides of all the squirt holes. Then, of course, the toys went straight into his mouth and it was not a healthy situation. There are so many other toys out there to keep our little guys happy in the tub. These have already been put into the recycle bin. I don't recommend them at all."
5,stimulating!,This book is a must for any sysadmin or power user. It is definitely not for the novice. It's writing structure is almost akin to what it would be like if you could read pthreads! I am so happy with this book.
3,Comments about the HP 6980 and 6980 DT color printer,"HP 6980 and the 6980DT are good printers if you are not running VISTA on your computer. HP has not updated their drivers to accommodate duplexing with VISTA. Quite annoying. I paid for a feature that I can not use until HP gets around to update their drivers, not a good way to treat customers. I also agree with the comment about quality. Too much cheap plastic that does not hold up. After the warranty expired (of course) a little plastic piece that holds the print cartridges broke, when I tried to buy the part and replace it myself (saving ridiculous labor costs) the HP Tech informed me that they do not sell it to customers, you have to take it to an ""authorized HP repair"" facility to fix it. Overall I think HP makes good printers (not great printers), but their long term durability is certainly questionable at best."
3,HP Deskjet 6908DT Printer,"The printer is above average once you get it set up and running. The reason I didn't rate it higher is that the new HP install programs are horrible - absolutely the worst I've seen in years - bloated, buggy, and a general pain in the neck.One minor problem with the printer operation is that it seems to have trouble automatically recognizing that it has a lower paper tray. The only way I could get it to work was to change the Printer Properties ""Source is"" from Automatically Select to Upper, then lower. Unfortunatlely doing this in the Printers and Faxes window doesn't seem to work for all apps. Some have to be configured individually."
4,Good Overall Printer,Like this for overall printing. Have yet to print many photos and use the photo connectivity. Great wireless but you do need to read instructions thoroughly.
5,Great color printer,I am enjoying this printer a great deal. The colors are nice and crisp. I have had no issues at all.
4,Great buy,Bought this printer specifically for the wireless print feature. This one was easy to set-up (worked the first time) and the print quality is excellent.
4,"Like many HP printers, great hardware...","Very good printer at this price point. Fast printing, both color and B&W, with lots of control over quality settings. However, the software is HP-bloated and not useful if you already have useful image cataloging and editing tools like Photoshop or Picassa. To HP's credit, you can uninstall everything except the driver and the printer works fine. Also, the wireless networking capability, in my experience, is unreliable and difficult to configure. I couldn't get the wired LAN connection to work at all. Still, I'm able to share the printer over our LAN by directly connecting the printer via USB to an XP computer and this works very reliably. I'd purchase this product again, I just wouldn't waste any time on the wireless or Ethernet connection."
3,printer,"Printer works great, but write-up made it sound as though it has internal wi-fi, but it doesn't still neeed to hook router up to it to make it wireless. Kind of defeated my purpose having to purchase another peice of equipment to set it up the way I wanted to."
5,A very moving and inspirational story.,"TITLE: PEELING THE ONION This is a book about a popular, funny, pretty girl named Anna Lockwood. That is, before her accident. After a car accident with her boyfriend, Anna finds that nothing will ever be the same again. As she sinks into a deep depression, Anna feels that she has no purpose in this life at all. Well, now that Luke has entered her life, she must face who she is and what she wants to do in life and that scares her... I loved this book! I have never read a book that is so emotional and so real. I know I could identify with Anna, and so could many others. She takes on the characteristics of any everyday teenager now. I would recommend this to anyone willing to read."
3,Finding yourself,"Anna Duncan is 17 years old, wonderful at karate, and is kindling a new romance. Riding home from a karate tournament, that she has just won, with Hayden, her ""boyfriend"" a car doesn't stop at a stop sign and Hayden slams into it. Anna breaks her neck and thumb, and sprains her ankles. She thinks her life is over after a year of fighting this. She can no longer take karate, she walks with a cane, and one of her closest friends deserts her. Then she begins ""peeling the onion"". She falls in love with a 20-year-old named Luke ho is helping her mom out at the nursery, she finds her true best friend, and she understands who she is. This book is a good book, but I don't recommend it for people who enjoy things that aren't suspenseful. I would read it again, if I was ever feeling really low, down, and out to cheer me up"
5,Peeling the Onion,"When I read this book I was moved by the author's writing, it made me feel like I was a part of the story. Although the debilitating effects of the car crash are similar in occurance to Cynthia Voigt's Izzy Willy Nilly, I felt this book took a deeper look at the relationships that were affected due to the accident. It took you through the emotional rollercoster unlike Voigt's book to which I had less of a personal reaction. I would like to reccommend this book to everybody."
3,Peeling the Onion is a Teenage Drama.,"+AH4-Before the accident, Anna knew who she was, a physically fit Champion of Karate, beautiful, popular, and bubbling with life. But now she can only stand for a matter of seconds, and she is forever experiencing pain and dizziness. When there is silence, all she hears is the pounding in her ears, and the question. Who am I? This book was a little hard to get into in the beginning, but it picked up after the first couple of chapters. The characters are interesting, and well defined. Peeling+AH4-+AH4- the ONION shows how a normal person's life can peel apart, leaving nothing left, but their heart.+AH4-"
1,"""Peeling the Onion""","Peeling the Onion was not that fascinating to me.In the story, the fictional characters were unappealing to me. The character personalities that the author chose for them are excessively dull. For example, I feel that Anna is more worried about her old boyfriend kissing her than anything else. I feel that is absolutely ridiculous. Throughout the story Anna was annoying to me, because I didn't like that she was more concerned about her love life than she was about her injuries. In my perspective I would want to become better. Another example is Luke. It appears Luke is waiting for Anna to break up with her boyfriend so that he can say he loves her. I think the book would become exciting if Luke told her he loved her at first. The book becomes lifeless without any action."
4,A TRUELY GOOD STORY,this book was not well written. you find yourself lost as it goes from one day to the next in a matter of seconds. The story line was good though i injoyed reading this book.it makes me thank god that im not in this girls place
1,My Friend Likes Hayden,I personally thought that this book was very bad. It focused more on her love life than her disabilities. I hardly think that if you were seriously hurt that you would be fluttering your eyelashes at guys. It comes off as entirely unrealistic and fictional. But Hayden is cute. At least my friend thinks so.
1,Beware of offensive language and mature subject matter,"Anna, high school senior, is coming home from winning a tournament when there is a terrible accident. Anna's life is changed completely and she must work through many adjustments - physically, emotionally, mentally, spiritually.This book should be for mature readers only, not only because of the offensive language, but also because of the subject matter (Anna talks of a desire to have sex, she wonders about ending her life, her unmarried friend admits to making love, and there is a description of Anna standing naked in front of a mirror)."
5,VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY GOOD,"I think that this book was extremely powerful and moving. This book has some scenes that are quite intense. While I read this book, I was in awe of what happened to the main character and what she had to go through. I have learned, from reading this book, who true heroes are."
4,really good book,"...I really thought that Peeling The Onion, was a good book. Annas story about survival and fighting to find out who she really was, was as captivating as if you were really there, helping anna find out who she really was Anna has a hard time finding out who she is, and like the title, Anna has to peel away all of the superficial layers and find out for herself what really lies inside."
4,Awesome Book!!,I found this book to be really interesting. I really like the fact that it seems really realistic. I think that if there were any more books like this I would definitely read them. It really caught my attention at the fact that she really liked Hayden but then decided she wanted to be with Luke. But over all this was a really awesome book. I would love for the author to write more of the same type of books.
3,Neat looking but not so comfy,"Elegantly styled, the shoes are classy but uncomfortable for lengths of time beyond 15 minutes."
5,A Thrill a Minuite with the Great White Shark,"The book ""surfing with the great white Shark"" by Kenny Doubt is a must reading for all surfers on the Pacific Coast. Kenny Doubt writes a vivid and compelling story of his encounter with the most feared preditor of oceans. He is fortunate to be alive to tell his story.His love of surfing lead him to be in the right place at the wrong time: Cannon Beach, Oregon on a cold winter day in 1972. The shark, in excess of 15 feet, was also in wrong place at the same time and the two met.The result was of this meeting near Haystack Rock was a tearing of the flesh, exposed organs, incliding the heart and lungs, and rescue bu surfing friends that ultimately save his life.The book includes pictures and medical detail that indicated the severity of his injuries including the more than 500 stiches the doctors counted.The writing is straight forward and comprehensive. It is a complelling short story that can't be put down until completed."
5,REAL JAWS,IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE HIT BY A GREAT WHITE AND SURVIVE THEN GET THIS BOOK.YOU WILL NOT PUT THIS DOWN UNTIL THE LAST PAGE IS TURNED.
5,Quality product!,Most folks don't give nail clippers much thought until they don't cut or you have to nearly bend the clipper before it goes through your nail.Not these. They're incredibly sharp and very well made.Basically you get what you pay for. A well made product for a reasonable price.
5,OUTSTANDING!,"It's not just advertizing hype, in my opinion; these really are the best nail clippers in the world! The quality of these clippers is outstanding. Fit, finish, esthetics and feel are, again, outstanding. Functionally, they are so sharp that minute portions of the nail may be removed and the cut's finish is as smooth as though a file had been used."
5,Nice sharp edges,"I use this toenail clipper for my fingernails, too. Because it's bigger, I can get more of the nail in one clip for a nice straight edge on the top. The edges are very sharp - a completely different experience from kind of chomping and tearing off my toenails. It's strong and sturdy. I never get that slipping of the pressure lever off to the side that I used to get with other brands. Worth the price. I've had it for a couple of years with no discernible dulling."
3,"Sharp, easy cuts... otherwise unimpressive","I always hated using clippers, but then I had chemo&radiation.; Since then my nails have been both very hard and very brittle. I bent and broke a few sets of nail and toenail clippers over the last few months, and finally sprung for these.Simply put, they are very sharp, but I don't really like them.They don't have a nail file, but after you trim your nails with these you REQUIRE a file. These are very sharp and cut the nail easily, but leave a knife-like edge of my toes.I also find them to be weirdly weighted and difficult to hold when trimming my nails.I'm not sending them back, because that's a hassle & I'm sure there's no such thing as an enjoyable nail clipper. And, I'd honestly be very happy with them if they had been half the price. But they weren't, so I feel like the price is too high.Maybe if I'm still using these clippers when I'm 85, I'll feel like I got my $ worth out of them! Ha!"
3,nail clipper,The clipper is made out of stainless steel. Using it is very difficultbecause of the slippery handle.
5,"Great nail clipper, worth the price!","I just received my nail clipper and decided to give her a try. MY GOD it really is amazing. I know people say, whats the difference? its just a nail clipper? but this baby is like a surgical scalpel. it cuts effortlessly and makes clean cuttings. well worth the money. made in Japan, stainless steel. get it and clip away. thats what I did :)"
1,Not ideal for thicker nails,Purchased this toenail clipper thinking it would have a larger opening for ...'older' toenails. Not the case. Not any different from the type found in drug store for much less.
4,Still Sharp,"I've owned these for over two years and they work just as well as when they were brand new. Actually, they still look brand new.When I received them, I did a visual comparison with my old Revlon clippers. I saw very little difference; the curve of the cutting edge was ever so slightly different. And I thought, ""Why did I spend so much on these?"" Initially unimpressed.But they are sharp, and the fulcrum, for lack of a better word, is stronger. They're great but I am too cheap to give five stars. They are expensive."
3,it's good but not great,i think it's a nice clipper but not a great one. it still leaves very sharp edges after cutting so i am not very satisfied with this product.
4,Sturdy,"The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that it doesn't open as wide as I would like. No, my nails that thick, but I do use clippers for other things."
2,I really was disappointed with this product!,"It is wholly inadequate for toe nails. I was thinking ""GIANT "" toe nail CLIPPERS. One that has leverage like a fulcrum. Perhaps I should have specified ""MEN""."
5,It is wonderful!,"At first my husband thought it was an extravagant purchase. However, after I started using the Seki Edge toenail clipper, I feel, it is something that I will use for years. There's the power in each clip that I have not experienced in other cheaper brands. It is something that people with hand arthritis can use without difficulty, as there is not much effort in each clip. More people should own one!"
1,NOT For Really Thick Toe Nails,"If you are coming to this product because others won't trim your thick toe nails, go elsewhere. Very disappointed since I expected more after reading all the glowing reviews. Not close to getting on my big toe nail. And the curve of the blade is too much for toenails and will probably promote ingrown nails. I will get the pliers kind with a wider opening for the toenails."
3,NOT FOR THICK TOENAILS,Bought this item due to all the rave reviews it got.While it is not the usual drugstore clipper that you get for a few bucks this is a good quality clipper that blows the competition away BUT the opening is rather small which makes it impossible to cut toenails.Mine are not unusually thick so i am a bit disappointed in this clipper's performance.Don't get me wrong these are quality clippers that did a fantastic job on my fingernails but not for the purpose i bought them for thus the 3 star review..
5,Best Nail Clippers Ever,"I have always been disappointed with drug store nail clippers. Even if they work well at first, eventually they do a poor job of cutting nails cleanly. A few years ago, I found a pair of very expensive nail clippers made by a German knife company, and they became my prized possession. Then my kids lost them. I have been looking for a replacement ever since. And now I have found something even better--the Seki Edge nail clippers. Every household should have several of these!! And, the price is reasonable, when you consider that you will have these 10x as long as the drug store clippers. Small things like this can make your life so much easier. Indulge yourself."
4,Excellent quality but small,"I love the quality of this clipper. It cuts cleanly instead of tearing the nail--as the cheaper clippers do these days (they didn't used to...). But I wouldn't call it a toenail clipper. The edge is somewhere between that of a fingernail clipper and a toenail clipper, definitely smaller than what I'm used to."
4,Super sharp,Super sharp and comfortable but not sure worth the price. I not only use these on myself but to clip my pets nails too. Extra sharp keeps pets nails from splintering leaving clean smooth cuts.
5,Finally the perfect nail clippers,Perfect. Just perfect. Until I got these I had no idea just how horrible the nail clippers from the drugstore are. These cut so smoothly it is unreal. Really a wonderful product
5,Didn't Disapoint,I'm very satisfied with this nail clipper. It cuts nails very easily without having to apply considerable preassure; its ergonomic design also helps too. I'm also very pleased with the quality and workmanship of this nail clipper. I don't think I'll have to buy a nail clipper for a couple of decades. I would highly recommend it.
5,Best toenail clipper so far.,I've got thick toenails. This cuts through them like butter. Very pleased with this purchase.
5,Best toe nail clippers ever!,"Simply put, these are the best toe nail clippers I've ever bought. Before settling on this one, I tried a few others, which cost less, but the quality wasn't nearly as good. This Seki version costs a little more than average, but it's completely worth it."
3,"It's nice, but...","These are nice clippers, but I really miss the under-nail digger and filer that comes standard on the 35 cent drugstore clippers. For the price, these clippers should really have all the bells and whistles, don't you think?I won't buy this again, they're ""just clippers"" to me. And they're lacking features."
4,Works Fine,The clipper work fine and makes clean cuts. I like the way it fits into my hand and is easy to control. Shipping was terrible - took 9 days.
5,darn good,"really good and strongi am not a big nail clipper guy, always used to buy from the 99 cent store, but this is different. worth the high price"
5,Own a piece of Samurai,"These clippers are made by the same people who make the Samurai sword in the mountains of Seki, Japan. How cool is that?!"
3,Not different than other clippers,I did not find this toe-nail clipper to be any better on my tough nails than the less expensive ones.
4,"Good, but not as good as `Where's Spot?'","Although `Where's Spot' is my son's absolute favourite book, this did not meet with the same degree of enthusiasm.That's not to say he doesn't like it, just not as much as `Where's Spot?' ... maybe it's the repetitive text in that one or maybe the novelty value was worn down, but both `Spot goes to the Farm' and `Spot Visits his Grandparents' seem to work as a ""side-dish"" for him i.e. only good alongside `Where's Spot', though does read both more often than most of his other books.All in all, I'd say buy this book, but with `Where's Spot?'"
1,bent pages,I purchased this book for my grandson. When it arrived I thought I had made a mistake and ordered a used book. Records shows this was to be a new book. It has bent pages and torn cover. Not a good gift to give.
5,Nothin' Rocks Like Video Game Music,"First of all let me get one thing straight. This album is not by some guy named Flex Busterman, it is actually by Patric Catani of ec8or. Although he is on the Digital Hardcore (DHR) label this album contains none of the annoying screeches and distorted drum and bass of most albums that they release. It is in fact a concept album recorded on a commodore 64 that tells the story of a video game. The truly great part of this cd is that it is comprised entirely of Nintendo/Atari style music with cool bass lines and funky drums under it. I'd have to say that this album is a must for all hyper nerds who spent their youth wasting away valuable time, energy and braincells in a glory seeking attempt to finally defeat Ganon. However I must add the disclaimer that just because you like this album, doesn't mean you'll like the other DHR label stuff (although I highly recommend it) and vice versa."
4,Pretty Good,This book is a great read but I feel it's not as good as the second one by a little bit and that's why I gave it four stars. That being said it is still very well written with great artwork to follow it up. I'm just beginning to get into The Incredible Hulk and I find these books to be great. I'd reccomend them for anyone that's just starting out like me or any long time Hulk fan.
5,Great phone,"I bought an unlocked SLVR L7 Pink phone and it is really great. My son liked it so much he bought a black SLVR L7. I really don't have any complaints other than my Phone service doesn't support the phone at this time and I can't get any downloads, but that doesn't have anything to do with the phone itself."
1,"A lot of fluff, very little meat","This book was a required text for my first semester of the Economics PhD core. I found the book to be a terrible disaster. Supposedly this book is a more basic approach to advanced macroeconomics, but I found I comprehended higher-level texts with greater ease than this book. The wording is very obtuse, which makes understanding the verbage difficult. Once you get past the words and understand the meaning, however, the explanations are also very inadequate given the complexity of the material.All in all, I have read my fair share of poorly-written textbooks, but I think this one tops them all."
4,Dry but what do you expect?,"This book is a serious step up for anyone with an intermediate undergrad macro background. However, as far as graduate texts go, this is a good one. The explanations are far better than most other graduate macro books and the problems at the end force the reader to think critically rather than simply recite text they just read."
3,Could be better,"This textbook had too much discussion and not enough equations, but that's probably the fault of economics professors in general, not Romer."
1,Kindle Edition is non-functional,"Text is sufficient in derivation and description of models. However, kindle edition is non-functional, as it cannot be resized and cuts off text, graphs, and equations at page's edge in both landscape and standard mode. Stick with the traditional format."
1,unfortunately there's nothing better,"One might divide economics books into two categories: those that are strong on explanation and intution, and those that are strong on proof. This book has neither, and unfortunately it appears to be the standard in graduate macroeconomics courses. I find myself wondering if it deliberately chooses the most obscure way to write its equations. For instance, in the Solow and Ramsey models, Romer retains the population and household variables throughout the entire proof rather than simply write them in intensive form. If you're reading the book after a lecture, it stands a chance of confusing you, especially because it tries to avoid optimal control theory (not a good idea!)."
3,Nextel i60,"Great phone, very light and easy to navigate. I just got this phone and I thought it would be like the nextel i90, I was wrong. You get no LCD screen in the front of the phone, you get limited ring styles and ect.. Overall great phone if not compared to nextels i90 or i95."
2,Simply Sucks,"I have owned a Nextel i60c for about 5mns. I hate it and i wouldn't recommend this phone to anybody. I think the little cheap nokia phones work way better and are much more attactive! The phone hardly ever gets reception, it's hard to have a convo when driving down the road...the phone hangs up when there is no reception.....it just sucks...and thats my thoughts on that!"
3,Buy it for half this price!!,Available at Staples for $99.00. This is a total ripoff on a phone that works about as well as all the rest that Nextel offers!
1,"Terrible, Just Terrible.","This phone is terrible. I don't have one personally, but use a friends quite often. It has terrible reception, often has an echo, and cut's off calls all the time. It doesn't do anything special, and the things it does do often don't work correctly anyway. My friend is very unhappy with it, and whenever I use it, I can't wait to get off. Don't buy it."
1,i60c good if it was 1997,"The Nextel service itself appears to be good if not better than other providers this review is for the phone itself. This is important seeing this is what you will be using from day to day.The Moto i60c is a very bulky phone by 2001 standards. Typical flip phones are smaller and offer much more options than this. The display is rather dark; there is no outside display you have to open it to see who's calling thus meaning you have to disable auto answer. There is an extremely limited feature set on this phone. Some reviewers said that the battery life was good they're either working for Moto or never use the phone.The battery life is terrible, the phone sat in my desk all weekend, a full charge Friday at 5PM and it was dead by Monday morning, never used or received any calls. This phone might be good if this was 1997 but its 2004 and technology is there for a smaller lower costing phone with better battery life and more options."
1,Bad internal speaker,"I am having speaker problems with this phone.... so much that I am thinking of trashing it. The internal speaker does not get activated most of the times when you make a call... and once in a while you can switch on the speaker-phone speaker. The same goes for receiving calls.Looking at a cheap, no frills, no problem phone for Nextel service..... Suggestions welcome."
4,"Good phone, gives you the basics","I would prefer a screen on the front of the phone so I can see who is calling, and different rings would be nice, but otherwise this is a good phone. It is perfect for business (which is what I use it for). The push-to-talk feature is fantastic, but that is more a credit to Nextel.The reception on this phone is very good, better than my personal phone. And the battery life on this phone lasts for days.The menus are easy to navigate and it does not take long to learn how to use this phone.For business, I would highly recommend this phone."
2,"Adequate for reference, but nothing special","Although the book tends to be visually appealing to an HTML reference purchaser, the book is definitely not a favorite. The examples in this book are not too good, and perhaps reference is all that may be obtained from it. It is definitely NOT worth purchasing for absolute beginners. Additionally, for those who have adequate HTML experience, there are several free HTML reference sites on the internet that may serve just as useful if not more than this WROX edition. If you're an individual who needs a hardcopy reference, I'd suggest looking for something better."
4,good reference book,"I had already done a few tutorials on the Internet for learning HTML, but this book really enhanced my understanding of HTML tags & had much more detail than those tutorials. I keep it by my side at work as a great reference! I would recommend it to anyone who is just learning HTML."
3,An OK reference.,"This could have been a much better book. It needed more examples (sample HTML code). It is also really out of date now, as you might suspect."
4,Great and Quick Reference to HTML,"This is not a thick book with everything you want or don't want of HTML. If you want to build or modify your personal web site, or working on a e-commerce site but need some quick reference, or refresh your memory, this is a very handy book to help you to get the things down easier than hold the thick one."
3,Expected more of this book...,"Well, after buying the Instant Javascript book from Wrox, I was hoping to expect the same type of help from this book. And I do have to say I was a bit dissapointed by it. Apparently, they took too much time explaining and going into worthless subjects, instead of grinding the meat with real world examples, usefull tips and tricks, and hopefully some new light on HTML (something that most of the newer WYSIWYG editors don't already do). So, as I have shown, this is not a book you might want to buy for really advanced proyects, or higher learning. If you're a newbie looking to get an understanding at HTML, then this is a book for you."
5,The perfect while-you-design reference.,"This book (and previously, it's predecessor) is always within arms reach when I'm working. The browser-compatibilty charts in the HTML reference tables (Appendix A) are worth the price alone for anyone who must write cross-browser Html. Also includes a CSS reference and (brief) JavaScript & VBScript references. Quite simply, a must-have."
5,A concise and thorough reference work,"The instructions about contacting the publisher for support encouraged me to write about a problem I was having getting ""list-style-type"" to work with a style sheet (using IE4).In the course of putting together a description of the problem for an email request for help, I discovered the solution. Sometimes customer support works in ways never anticipated. But first it has to solicited. These authors recognize the reciprocal benefits of reader assistance."
4,What a good name for a band.,"I first discovered this band when I stumbled upon a clip of their live show online. I think maybe that is the way it is most meant to be experienced.Sure, you can give this a listen in your bedroom at 3am while you wait for the demons to come out from under your bed and through the cracks in the door... but it might scare you too much. Lots of this stuff is pretty weird. For example in ""Astral Dustbin Dirge"" you'll be slowly carried along a lulling journey into space, soon turning into an amalgamation of demonic breathing, a heart monitor beeping, a woman gasping, channeling through the left and right speakers in no discernible pattern.Overall a very dark body of work, but I also find it to be generally quite soothing and calming."
4,"Dinos, dinos and more dinos!","I got this actually bought this book in hopes of being able to convert one of the dinosaur patterns into a dragon. My young son loves dragons and I can't find a pattern for a dragon. There were so many dinosaur patterns in this book - not just the standard triceratops, T-rex and brontosaurus. I found several that can be adapted. I also found several that I want to make as dinosaurs. I only wish the patterns were bigger - to make bigger dinosaurs. The direction were not always clear so that I had to reread them to understand the step I was trying to do. Overall a great book for the money!"
4,Amazing Stove,"First, I bought Bayou two times, and it was very bad.I returned both items and then I saw this Brinkmann Double Burner Stove and I ordered it. It blew my mind! Assembly takes only two minutes! It works very well and I recommend it to everyone. If you want to do outside cooking, this stove is perfect for you.The price is good and using the item is very easy. The stove is amazing and I recommend it for beginner or experienced cooks."
4,The joy of little siblings,"Karen adores her big step-sister. At first Kristy thinks this is funny, but then realizes that when someone looks up to you so fiercely, you have a responsibility as a role model, and when she does something bad, she doesn't want Karen to find out. Overall a pretty good book, even if Karen could be a pest at times."
4,alright,"the book doesn't deal that much with karen copying kristy and I don't recall a karen book about this from karen's point of view, maybe that kind of book would have been more of the main plot. This book should have been titled about kristy and the softball team at SMS and all the initiation."
3,Thanks,"No idea if this stuff will work. Bought it years ago and have no idea whether it helped, or other factors caused my hair to return. No harm done :)"
2,Marketing ploy?,"I haven't finished listening to this yet and I'll probably shelve it. The original soundtrack is THE BOMB, one of the best film scores ever, but this doesn't live up to its name of ""More music from Braveheart"". It seems like an ill attempt at squeezing more money out of a good thing. There are only a few unreleased tunes on this album (I counted 5 out of the 25 listed). If you want to hear the speeches over again, I suggest watching the movie instead. This was a disappointment from an otherwise exc. original movie score. Save your money and continue to listen to the first one."
3,"Not the worst, not the best","I am a big fan of this film and also of the soundtrack. So, naturally, when I came across this album, I purchased it. I will say that it does have diologue straight from the film overlaying the music and this isn't the best quality. But, if you like the speeches of the film, or you need some motivation, maybe it is good for you. The bagpipe tracks that are included which are not in the film are ok as well. All in all, I like this CD, and listen to it together with the original soundtrack on the iPod. However, if bagpipes and voiceovers bother you; then I'd advise to stick with the original soundtrack."
3,Eh...,"Hey, if you want the score with the dialogue over it, just watch the movie. Save the bagpipes for a Scottish album, none of those were in the film so why call this MORE music FROM Braveheart? It's not bad, for the news stuff, not on the first score release, but it's mediocre for the rest of it, the dialogue stuff and the bagpipes."
3,Enchanting soundtrack,"TheBraveheart: Original Motion Picture Soundtrackis an incredible soundtrack. However,More Music From Braveheart (1995 Film)isn't quite as good. This CD is more likeGladiator: More Music From The Motion Picturein that it combines soundtracks with dialogue from the films. Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't. Of course, the Freedom speech is stirring. In addition, some of the tracks have bagpipes (which I personally don't care for). While the CD has some good tracks, I wish it had been more music from Braveheart (as the title suggests) rather than the other stuff."
2,Just watch the movie...,"...if you want to listen to the music with the dialogue. I personally like to listen to soundtracks that are, well, soundtracks, i.e. music, not the audio track of the movie. Oh well, the couple of pieces that don't have obnoxious voice over are just fine."
1,Not worth it,"I had previously been using a copy of trial type Pinnacle that came with a video card, but had decided on Video Director 3 for my full blown software after reading an online review, not Amazons. The product was extremely glitchy to load and initially would not recognize my Sony HC-40. When I finally was able to capture video, it dropped 300+ frames in only 19 seconds of video. Pinnacle NEVER dropped a single frame on me. Tech support cost $30 per phone call after the initial one free call, use it to ask for a refund. The one star rating if for the art work on the packaging. I went out and got Pinnalce 9 and have had no problems since."
4,Good product,"I had to edit this review after I have tried other video editing programs. I think it should be 3 stars but I cannot edit that part of the review.I have created exciting videos from this product. The recommendation is to use at least 1.8ghz cpu speed for mpeg2. My computer has the minimum speed and not even a Pentium. It works fine though.It is nice to know that it requires very little HD memory. For an hour of video is like 2-4 gig as compared to other softwares at 15 gigs. But the trade-off? Video quality is so-so.Some annoyances:If you add or remove a video segment, the titles, additional audio, etc. needs to be adjusted manually.In the chapter and thumbnail authoring, you cannot move the thumbnails around. You have to follow a fixed template. So, if you have a pix of your son on the background, you cannot relocate a thumbnail around so it does not cover his face."
3,Buggy,"I bought this program and it is somewhat unstable...sometimes it will freeze when loading and you have to manually shut down your pc and try again, (I run Windows XP on a Sony Vaio PC). When you do get it to run, expect dropped frames on your final video production. Adobe Premiere is much better....they now have a home user version for under 100 dollars. And Video Explosion Deluxe by Nova Development also works better...All in all, you may want to download their trial version and give it a good workout before you invest in a product that nine out of ten times will freeze the PC..."
1,"Won't work at all, zippo tech support","After installing it on a Toshiba Satellite P25, it produced error messages stating I was lacking XP Service pack 1 (I'm not) and would not read any audio or video files. Also, Real Player stopped playing any audio files as well. Had to uninstall to get the other media programs to work. Message to tech support returned the response (after 3 days) that it must be a hardware problem, contact the manufacturer. Would not buy another CyberLink product if they were giving them away."
4,A pleasant afternoon,"A nice story for a Sunday afternoon, particulary if you're the type to enjoy Colonial Williamsburg or Phila. streetscapes. Very nice if you have some first or second hand knowledge of professional historians.I could not help but think of Rebecca Lee as an Ann Coulter with black hair, and kept envisioning Jim Lehrer, like affable Wally morphing slowly into Ben Franklin with age. I will read another Lehrer novel for sure."
2,"Unless there's a ""Part 2"" coming ...","... I don't recommend this book. I enjoyed it all the way to the last page. But after receiving several paper cuts trying to find the additional pages that should be there, I felt like I was ""R"", the main character, trying to determine if someone had pulled a hoax on me. That said, if there is a part 2 (I haven't found anything indicating there will be), I'll buy it. Mr. Lehrer raised a lot of interesting situations -- I'd like an end to complement the beginning and middle."
1,A waste of money and time.,"The presentation attempts to be cute by using animation. There is little english used and very little that can be used long term or that vould not be picked up watching ""Dora the Explorer"".I was very disappointed."
5,It's a must read...,"I never thought that I would write a review of a book on campaign finance reform and call it a ""page turner,"" but this one is just GREAT....It keep me enthralled all the way to the end, which is more than I can say about other books on similar subjects.Despite what many think, living inside ""the beltway"" does not necessarily equate to an knowledge of the inner-workings of Congress. In fact, although I read the news coverage of the protracted campaign-finance reform battle, I didn't have a clear understanding of the difficulties behind-the-scenes.What I enjoyed most about Elizabeth Drew's latest book--Citizen McCain--is that it delves into all of the inner workings: the wrangling and deal-making that accompany Congressional legislation. Ms. Drew is able to explain it in plain English--and it's fascinating.I definitely recommend this book."
2,SEE WHAT MCCAIN HAS SOLD OUT: HIS OWN INTEGRITY,"Here you can see a glowing report of John W. McCain in 2002 surrounded by several of the GOP sharks who have since resigned in disgrace, such as Dick Armey, The Hammer DeLay and of course the vicious Karl Rove. Having learned to defeat them he became them, and worse.What this book best demonstrates is how well, how skillfully, McCain controls the media, including the once great Drew. See alsoFree Ride: John McCain and the Media, see also Drew'sFear and Loathing in George W. Bush's WashingtonandCorruption of American Politics: What Went Wrong and Whyamong her many others. How the mighty fell . . ."
2,A boring book about a compelling political figure,"I just finished this book, and I really don't see any point at all. This book was just a meandering tale with McCain at the center, shedding no light on him as a private or public figure. I have to point out that I like McCain as a character and I was hoping to learn more about him as a politician. Articles that I have read in magazines lately are much more informative. Read the excerpt and if you are not hooked, do not expect the writing to improve."
1,Buyer beware,"Drew always thinks her opinions arefacts not to be questioned. In this book she suggests that Senator McCain, not president Bush, was the more calming influence after 9/11. She nees to get outside the Beltway."
4,Good but overpriced at Amazon,"This is an excellent product for those on a low-carb diet. It makes excellent waffles and pancakes. Great for an occasional treat that's not off-plan.Agree with the others that it's overpriced here. Came here to order via Amazon Prime and found it was more than double for the same product, same size at another site."
2,Carbquik tastes like bisquik,"I suppose some people might rate this product higher as it is a great substitute for Bisquik, however I didn't like it because everything I made from it tasted like Bisquik."
2,"Great product, insane pricing","Carbquik is an amazing product. I use it for all kinds of bread like things on my low carb diet. breadsticks are delicious, the pizza crust is awesome.my only gripe with this is that its TWICE the price on Amazon. Netrition.com offers it for nearly half the price."
4,"Great product, but strange texture","The taste is different than flour for sure, but in a very good way. Just be careful when substituting it in recipes where you're hoping for something sturdy or stiff. When used in pizza crusts, it tends to crumble and you end up with more of a pizza casserole. However, it makes excellent pancakes, and when used in sauces/rousses, it's basically indistinguishable from flour. All in all, the texture takes getting used to but the taste and low-carb formulation are definitely worth it."
2,works but funky odor/taste,I read through all the reviews before buying this product hoping that I wouldn't be one of the people who noticed the odor and weird aftertaste. Unfortunately it was just too pronounced. I made a couple things with the mix and my family and I all found it awful.
3,Good but way overpriced!,This item does make fairly good baked goods but not worth the high price in my opinion. Does not compare with regular baking four at all though.
3,So-so,It's really expensive and doesn't taste all that good. The cheddar biscuit recipe is about the only thing that was edible that I could make. I have a box that's been sitting untouched in the pantry for the past year.
5,Wonderful,"This product is great! I would recommend purchasing xanthan gum as well, because it isn't as stable as Bisquick in the dough holding together, just a tiny bit works wonders. As mentioned before, it can be purchased for less than half the price from Netrition. The blueberry muffins are delicious, and I use regular Bisquick recipes substituting Carbquik and sugar substitute and have had no bad results."
4,VERY USEFUL BAKING PRODUCT FOR DIABETICS,"This product came in most handy due to my big appetite for a slim person and I am a diabetic of about 1 1/2 years now Type 2. It became very useful for me to be able to make my pumpkin bread, cocoa bread, as well as experiment in making other baking goodies with this products. The vast majority and I mean vast majority of baking ingredients such as meal, flour, breads, i.e. are so so loaded with carbs and diabetics are limited to the amount of carbs one can eat during a meal and throughout the day. This product ""gives back"" ways of baking and making things now that we cannot eat anymore, should NOT eat anymore and if one does a very limited and very small portion! And last, the product baked up just find with me and taste great in my recipes and baked goods! P.S., I just wished the cost was a tad bit lower. THANKS!!!"
4,Not Too Bad,"We tried this tonight for pizza crust. It really wasn't too bad, but there are some issues to be aware of if you are going to use it. The directions say add 1/3 cup of very hot water and mix to form a soft dough. No way does this happen. you have to get your hands in there and kind of work it all together and then it is pretty dry and crumbly. Kneading brings it together somewhat. As far as getting it in the pan, just be patient. Flatten it out as best you can and then start working from the center and press outwards. It takes a lot of work, but you can cover a 12 inch pan with it. It will be very thin though. I didn't find the flavor all that objectionable if you have a lot of toppings on it. I think the trick to all this low carb stuff is desperation anyway. Once you are on the diet long enough even cardboard tastes good. :0)"
5,Love this stuff,"I've used this many times over the past couple of years. Biscuits, breading for fried chicken, low carb brownies, etc. If you are following a low carb lifestyle, this is a great substitute for white flour-laden products. It does have a different taste, and a little aftertaste, but if you are doing the low carb thing, you're probably already familiar with that. I use this for anything I would usually use Bisquick for. I hadn't had a biscuit in over a year when I tried this...I was so glad I found it. Carbalose- the flour they use, is also available from some sites by itself- You can use this in even more recipes."
2,Pricey,For the money the product was not as good a claimed. It was not as good as the Atkins version.
5,Interesting Movie,"I read some reviews and thought I would like this movie, and I did. I did have to watch it a few times to understand some of the undertones that were going on as I was confused, but the insight on Meth addiction and abuse going on was eye openning. The documentaries included were informational and sad."
5,Perfect Tea Spoon For Scooping Loose Tea,This is a perfect Tea Spoon for scooping loose tea. It is stainless steel and not multicolored as the stock photo depicts. With this spoon you can rest easy that one scoop will yield a perfect cup of tea. I love it.
4,This is a Christmas present...,We didn't open this yet but bought it early because we read it was discontinued. We also bought the fire engine desk too. They came very fast. The boxes are pretty heavy so I think it's going to be a strong piece of furniture when we put it together for Christmas. We read good reviews on it from other sites.
3,Where's the Dies Irae?,"As a student studing the plaingsong of the Dies Irae, I was hoping this cd would be able to help me procure a culmination of works containing the melody. None of these works do, however, which was disappointing to me and seemed like a misnomer on the part of Deutsche Grammophone. Nevertheless, the music contained in these 2 cds is classic, though also cliche. I am particularly partial to the Carmina Buranna."
4,The best battery deal on the net,I have had this battery for a few months and it has been great! The battery I have lasts longer than the original. I totally recommend Digicom products
3,Not bad,"I like the fact that you can play various modes in this game. But I must say that winning the World Series in this game is as boring as watching old people eat. There is no celebration, no running onto the field by fans, there is NOTHING!!!!. You just win and thats it. I have problems moving minor league players into the majors. You do not have a dynasty mode in this game which is needed. I hope the 2005-06 versiion is a lot better than this one.K-JAY"
3,baseball video game afficianado,"This game is very disappointing. Before I say more, I must warn that I have only played the game for a couple of days. I have yet to get into the franchise and season modes but I'm sure they are no different from last years WSB. Let's start off with what I dislike:-The batting graphics are choppy and the swing looks horrible.-players look more bloated than last years.-the home runs travel way too far, almost 500 ft. each time.-they only added one new stadium (Puerto Rico)What I did like:-6 or so uniforms to choose from for each team-player's faces look superb(...)"
2,Too many glitches,"The biggest problem with this game is that 1 out of every 3 games i play it freezes (usually during a pitching change or to pinch hit) and in each game there are MANY MANY glitches. An infield single is ruled as an error? I cant even list all the problems with the announcers, one is when they say ""Wow what a homerun"" 2 or 3 batters after the homerun was hit. Overall its a good game if you can finish a baseball game and you dont mind the glitches, but i think Sega rushed this game and it is very sloppy."
2,Grating,"The music is appropriately mystical and pleasing, and Rumi's poems are of course peerless, profound, and timeless. But Andrew Harvey's enunciation in performing the poems is grating - overly emotional, and whiney, as if spiritual extascy were somehow a complaint."
4,"An excellent book,often overlooked by many","(Along with Volume 1) This is an excellent book especially if you want to know anything about analysis of variance in a classical set up. It provides in a unified form (and uniform notations) a large volume of scattered literature. If you work with model based experimental data and data analysis where variability is a major consideration, this book should be your academic companion. Certainly, this book is under-recognized for its real academic and practical values."
4,Many fine things in a bargain reissue,"I started listening to this 1978 recording without high expectations, not being a fan in particular of Caballe or Carreras. And the notion of Colin Davis as a Verdi conductor was dubious. But by the end of CD1 the excitement of this performance had taken hold. It is one of Carreras's best roles on CD--lyrical, passionate, with many lovely touches. Caballe pairs excitingly with him, and the Oscar and Ulrica are both excellent. Despite the un-Italiante, rough-voiced Wixell, I found this one of the better Un Ballos on disc, and at a bargain price I now prefer it to Pvaarotti-Price-Solti. Excellent choral and orchestral work, too."
3,"This is a good recording, but there are better","I own this recording and I am fairly pleased with it. I am not really a fan of Caballe's voice for verdian roles but she pulls it off allright. Carreras does a lovely job as well. I am not really impressed with Wixell. His voice just seems to small for verdian roles. Overall I would like to see bigger more dramatic voices in this opera. Don't get me wrong I do enjoy this recording but I much prefer traditional verdian voices singing this opera. For example the Bergonzi/Price recording , the Domingo/Riciarelli (which features Gruberova as Oscar), or the one I'm planning to purchase the Domingo/Arroyo version. Shop around before you buy this. If you want a cd in the double decker format (which is cheaper) buy the Domingo/Riciarelli, it also features Brunson and Gruberova. This is a decent recording, but unless your a huge Caballe/Carreras fan, look around."
4,Now I understand Elvis,"The protagonist, Leroy Kirby is Elvis. Childress only changed the names of the Presley family, Col Parker, a couple other rockers of the day, and Sam Phillips. He made up some blues songs to go along with some of the performances. That left him free to give us conversations and feelings to create a personal glimpse into the life of a shy, lonely man who was flamboyant while being insecure. I lived in Memphis and met Elvis briefly a few times. He'd be sitting behind the fence at Graceland, usually with a girl, and would talk to the tourists.All those years of touring and you never heard of Elvis being involved in the kind of parties other rockers were famous for; why? Now I know. If he was a good Baptist boy, how did he get into drugs; the same slippery slope Michael Jackson and so many others slid down. What was Elvis ""really like?"" Read this book."
3,"The story of Elvis, but his name is Leroy","I was never a big Elvis fan, kinda before my time -- so i have to admit that i never knew much about his life or his music... well now i do! The start was ssslllooowww but it did pick up when he became a teenager- i read it 'cuz i LOVED Crazy in Alabama (by Childress) but honestly i was not impressed by this book, and the way it ended was so sudden. Guess i dont need to read up on Elvis (feel like i did). Read Crazy in Alabama, that is a great read!"
5,Rossini: Complete String Sonatas,I had this on a album years ago. One of my favorite relaxation items and was sad to lose it. Found it again on Amazon with the same string quartet. Love it!! Service was very good also!
2,Fun Toy- broke after 2 days,My son recieved this toy for his first birthday. He played with it lovingly for two days then it stopped working. It is a fun drum and he loved it while it worked.
4,great sunglasses for the price,These sunglasses were exactly as rated by users. A good buy too. The bifocal line on the glasses is not that noticeable and the lenses are not too large yet hey are also dark enough to block sunlight and the decorations on the sides are discreet enough.They also fit well on a woman's face. The other glasses that are unisex tend to be too big for most women's faces. I really like the sunglasses and would recommend them.I ordered 2.5 strength and they are fine. I just didn't want to purchase prescription sunglasses because of the expense and these glasses fit the bill.
2,Not well made,I liked these glasses but they broke after a month. They cracked and the lens fell out.
2,"redundant, kept waiting for practical training, too ""hip""","I found the speaker's voice quite irritating after awhile. I kept waiting to hear more than ""wake up""-""enjoy"". I was looking for more actual meditation instruction, rather than his pleas to enjoy life daily. I say instead buy the ""Tibetan Book of Living and Dying"" by Sogyal Rinpoche for a real, honest, wonderful look at Tibetan Buddhism and life in general. This selection strives to be a little too hip, too 90's for me, which is what I am tired of and want to get away from. I am interested in the serenity of the Tibetan people and Buddhist beliefs and how to apply it to my life, not American rhetoric over and over. I was disappounted by what the cover said and what was inside."
1,NOT Mac OSX compatible,"My mom bought this for our children, and we were excited to try it out. Imagine our surprise when we realized that Mac OSX compatible is really Mac OSX ""Classic"" compatible, which is really Mac OS9 compatible! It was only when we inserted the disk and double-clicked the icon that we realized our mistake. TOO LATE! Can't return it with the plastic off... Oh well."
4,Surprisingly good.,"I enjoyed this album. When I first listened to it, I thought it was a hoot to hear Bob Dylan songs performed by a British cabaret singer. I especially enjoyed Jungr's sweet but still sultry rendition of ""I'll Be Your Baby Tonight"". My other favorites were ""Don't Think Twice, It's All Right"", ""What Good Am I?"", ""It's All Over Now, Baby Blue"" and ""Tangled Up In Blue"". There are a few misses on this disc. For instance, Jungr's cover of ""Forever Young"" didn't especially grab me. I have been a Dylan fan for over 30 years, and one of the things I love about his music is his rough emotional and stylistic edge. Barb Jungr's interpretations of these 15 songs are anything but rough or edgy. If you like show tunes or smooth jazz, Jungr's style is right up your alley. If you're a hardcore Dylan fan, you'll have to be open to a very different slant on Bob, but I suggest you take a chance on this surprisingly good album."
5,Dark marriage of horror and humor,"One of the things that I have always liked about Joe Lansdale is that he dares to be different. His tales tend to have plotlines that you will not find in other writers' stories, and he has a dark sense of humor that will make you feel almost guilty for finding some of the bits funny. Not all of these stories are actually horror stories, but those that are will probably still disturb you even after you have put down the book. Almost all of the stories in this collection stood out to me for one reason or another, but the stories that made the deepest impression on me were ""Love Doll: A Fable,"" ""Bubba Ho-Tep,"" ""Drive-in Date,"" and ""In the Cold Dark Time."" These four stories stand out to me as being the most exemplary of Lansdale's unique voice. However, ""Godzilla's Twelve Step Program"" is the story that is the most ""fun"" in the book."
3,Roaster,"This is a weak pan,The pan is a good pan but weak we get our ham from a butcher and they are big ham's the pan did hold up to our ham's , The handels sre weak they bend easy ,over all it is a good pan my wife said She would buy another one if she needed to"
5,Proves Fairy Tales Aren't Just for Kids,"Fairy tales and folk tales are for all ages and about all ages. The amazing Jane Yolen edited this collection of tales that are often overlooked or forgotten. The tales, as the title implies, focus on older characters instead of the younger ones we often read about in Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. Yolen has collected tales that will be of interest to any reader looking for a different focus when reading fairy tales and folklore. The multicultural sources emphasize the presence of elder characters around the world. This book would be particularly great as a gift to a parent, grandparent or other person who first read you a fairy tale as a child."
5,"Awesome product, unbelievable price.","I really like power squids. They are great for electronics, particularly when you have several ""wall wart"" type supplies that need to be plugged in. With a regular power strip, ""wall warts"" often take up 2-3 plugs greatly limiting a power strips effectiveness. This works around the issue. The only downside is that this is slightly bulkier than a power strip. If you have the room or the need, I still highly recommend this over a power strip due to ease of use and availability of all outlets.Just make sure you are getting the Surge Supressor version. Not all versions have surge supression."
5,Very handy,"We recently purchased a washing machine that has a computer operating system in it.So as anyone knows, you should protect any computer with a surge suppressor.The PowerSquid is doing this job very well and allows other appliances that have transformers to be plugged in also.As usual Amazon had them at the lowest delivered price that I could find."
4,Customer,The squid power cable is very useful. This cable is especially useful for computer plugs which is very large. I find the product is well designed and suited for its purpose.
4,Power Sentry,Great product for computer owners with a lot of attached peripherals. I have bought 2 of them and have found them to be invaluable.
4,Very Useful Powerstrip,"I have 2 of these.Pros:-The main problem with conventional power strips is that once you start plugging those power adapters that come with your gadgets, one of those alone can take up 2 to 3 outlets in shear space. With these, you can plug up to 5 individual adapters. If that is your case, then this is very useful to you.-You can buy it in pure all-white (if that is what you prefer) if you shop around.-the main cord (not shown) that you attached to the wall is quite long which allows you more flexibility in reach.Cons:-You may think first that it is unique, strange and even a conversational piece, but after that and having given it a second look, it does not look as pleasing as you would like it to be. Particularly if you have 5 power adapters attached to it. It is also huge.-540 joules of protection is not that much as compared to other similar products."
3,Equipment protection guarantee is very limited,"Be careful if you intend to put this to any 'limited outdoor use' as the box indicates would be appropriate -- the product protection guarantee excludes lightning and 'accidents'. This is a great concept and a well-built piece of equipment. I have owned a (non-suppressor model) PowerSquid for 5+ years now without a hitch. I just think that if you really care about hard-core protection, you might want to look at a Belkin or some other model that has more robust surge suppression -- it almost seems like in producing this model, the suppression was added to the older PowerSquid model as an afterthought, rather than it being built around a solid protective design. UPDATE: I wanted to add that I did research and found that the similarly-priced Belkin surge suppressors DO cover damage caused by lightning -- in fact, their guarantees are more or less entirely inclusive, quite the opposite of the PowerSquid's."
4,Good Product,Got this at a cheap price. I bought 3 of them. It is a lot bigger than it looks. It works well. Would buy again
4,MUCH bigger than I anticipated,"This is an ingenious design, but it's a lot bigger than I thought it would be, more for a garage/power tools setting than home office. I hope they have one that isn't all three-prong outlets. It's really HUGE."
2,Misleading advertising,"To be sure, this album has some beautiful cuts. But that is overshadowed for me by the fact that while megastars Bartoli and Bocelli are featured so prominently on the cover, THEY ONLY SING ON 4 OUT OF 16 TRACKS. This kind of misleading advertising is reprehensible. If I hadn't purchased this while on vacation, I would have returned it"
1,mostly instrumental and choral,Those who expect vocals by the featured singer Bocelli will be disappointed. He only sings one selection. The selections are almost completely instrumental and choral.
2,"Sorry, this is not for me.","I don't even want to get THIS! Sexy Andrea Bocelli only has ONE song on the whole CD: Georges Bizet's ""Agnus Dei.""My recommendation: Get any of Andrea Bocelli's SOLO recordings, like ""Romanza,"" ""Verdi,"" etc. But NOT THIS, please....."
2,"Quick delivery and good price, but not the right kind","I bought this set for my daughter's violin. Her teacher made us buy another set because this set is made of steel. She warns that steel strings for small size violins don't sound right, but a friend has already replaced the strings for us. We are keeping them as a backup only."
4,"A wonderful look into the world of ""Rods!""","Jose Escamilla is the best known person when it comes to Rods. His documentary, ""Rods-Mysterious Objects Among"" is a great video to watch and own. Hopefully, as the only video on rods, you will be more educated on them after watching this film!"
3,Not the book if you are plumbing your own house,"I'm building my own house and bought this book as a plumbing reference. It has pretty much sat on the shelf. It is more oriented toward the full time plumber who is doing multiple types of jobs. Too much time spent on the many fascets of plumbing and too little time spent on how it applies to doing a residential job.Instead I'd recommend ""Complete Home Plumbing"" by Sunset books. That book has been my first read when a question comes up."
4,If you like this Check out Volume 3 from Webster Hall,This is such a awesome track when it is mixed perfectly with other club hits. Check out Volume 3 from Webster Hall Records. This is a mix of the kind of music you would hear at Webster Hall the night club in NYC. They have a brillant CD mixed by one of their resident DJ's. This CD makes you really appreciate a good DJ and the art of mixing the perfect compilation.
5,"SM-Trax is in the house, in the house...","Three words...FAB-U-LOUS! This and ...Is calling are two of my favorite tracks this year. Purchase this one, and have fun dancing and feeling its vibe!"
5,Just broke out on NYC radio! Out of control!,"This track has made a huge impact on NYC radio in 1999. Yes, it is as good as all the club heads have mentioned. New and unique hooks will make you wanna move and have people asking, ""Who's that? What's the name of this one?"" Top ten of the year! Enjoy!"
4,A very fine performance,"The performance in this disc seems to me to be very fine. The artists realize a world of Robert Schumann, his romanticism with lonely atmosphere."
4,Electronic MP3 purchase,Electronic MP3 purchase. Purchasing music electronically is the only way to go! Accessible from any computer via Cloud Player! Yay!
2,Dissapointing!,"Not a good book for a high price. Only few pics with no details. I expected more advanced teschniques, but it's just simply a recipe book. Recipes can be downloaded in the net. Nothing special with this book."
5,SUPER Book...ONLY book you will need!,"This book is a MUST!!It has TONS of information on chocolate, pies, cake..etc. Was impressed with the simplicity of the directions and the process of making the recipes. I know alot though about pastry, so if you dont know alot, you will learn!!!"
4,Eye Candy,"Beautiful, not for the time challenged or cupcake slackers. You need time and patience in order to complete these recipes, and will have to flip around for the components of some of them.Lovely to look at, and may inspire folks to try some of the feats presented."
4,Advanced,"This was a gift purchase for my sister who has her own catering company...and when she tells me the recipes are complicated I know it's WAY out of my league! :) Beautiful photos, very explicit instructions but not for the novice.She loves the books, and I love the desserts she makes from it! :)"
5,Everything you need to know about baking is in this book.,"The pictures are very detailed and it shows many variations on several of the popular desserts. It even tells you about presentation. With hundreds of recipes to choose from, this book is a must for any baker, whether you are a student, or work in a bakery or in a restaurant."
3,Longest Ride review,"I haven't finished the book,but it seems to stress the social and political aspects of travel, rather than the physically enduring and mechanical problems of the motorcycle; somewhat disappointing to me. Still,an amazing accomplishment by any standard. Roy"
3,Amazing story,"The book starts off in tremedous detail and gives an insight into how someone unprepared for the journey ahead can meet and conquer unforeseen obstacles both figuratively and physically. As with other road trip books, as it nears the end, large chunks of the trip are missing as the book races towards completion. I felt very dissappointed at the end of the book to have missed so much of the journey compared to the start."
3,Started Great and Then Fizzled,"This book started off really well with lots of interesting narrative and great pictures. Although it was obviously written in spanish and translated to English, the strange wordings add to the fun of the book.But as time goes on, he writes less and less and relies on pictures to tell the story - whole countries pass with barely more than ""then I went to..."". By the time he gets married, there is almost no narrative at all, so it seems that he lost interest in the book and had a publisher's deadline to meet.The first half of the book is 5 star, the last half 1-2 star, so I give it a 3 star rating overall."
2,Overblown,"While not wanting to belittle the achievements of someone away for such long period of time .This is a poorly written book of this genre,lacking perspective of time . The first part quite detailed then the last five years just captions under photographs .Good photos though but not enough to recommend it."
4,Mega Bloks Mega Firetruck,I purchased this product for my 18month old grandson. It seems he likes the truck very much and as it has a handle he can walk around pushing the truck. My daughter also seemed happy with the product.
5,Still - Steel Drums Christmas with sacred overtones,"A nice change of pace. Enhanced by tasteful orchestration, McDermand's exuberant steel drums and soft marimba lead the listener through traditional Christmas music. Tracks include 1. Coventry Carol 2. Carol Of The Bells 3. Mary's Boy Child 4. O Holy Night 5. Jesu, Joy Of Man's Desiring 6. Hymn 7. Sleep, O Sleep, My Precious Child 8. Gesu Bambino 9. Still, Still, Still 10. The Holly And The Ivy."
4,Kinda small,"This thing is perfect for them to sleep in. Durable, easy setup. But should me a little bit bigger."
4,Great for Potty Training,"My daughter is only 22 months old, so she needs a foot stool to reach the toilet. The kid foot stools are too small and unstable. These footstools will not flip up/over. The child has plenty of room to step up, turn around, and sit down. The stool is wide enough for the child (and parent!) to feel confident and comfortable enough to bend over and pull his/her underwear up or down. The stool is also high enough for the child to put his/her feet down flat.I gave this stool a 4, because the stool I received was not as pictured. It does not have the shiny chrome plating as pictured and described. It has a black and gray mixed matte finish. Under most circumstances, I would have been very upset about it, and for a moment I was. In the end, I'm O.K. with it, because it better fits the decor of my home."
2,Stinky!!!!,"The step works but the smell is HORRIBLE!!!!! I have tried all sorts of ways to get rid of the burnt rubber smell on these. I bought two of them and as for a stool they are great, but you can not keep them in the house with the smell. I would think the company would have gotten the smell out before they sent them. It's been a month and they are still outside because they smell bad! If they did not smell I would have given them a 5."
3,Foot Stool,"We purchased the Bariatric Foot/Step Stool and had a problem with the rubber cover on the top. It was not placed correctly by the manufacturer and there was a 1/2 inch of glue exposed. We contacted the seller and it was replaced and we have received the replacement. We are still awaiting UPS to pick up the old one. A little frustrating with the box sitting in our check-in area. If someone doesn't soon pick it up, then we may have to discard it."
1,No Subtitles?,"On reading reviews of 7th series The Shield. am amazed that the producer of the DVD has decided not to put on subtitles. DVD not yet released in Australia I believe, but as a fan of the greatest TV police drama ever, I'm afraid because of my hearing difficulty, I will not be buying the article. Very sorry. I don't know why producers af any TV shows still, refrain from subtitles, as there are so many deaf watchers of TV that must have the words along the bottom. Certainly very thoughtless of them, especially if it is to save money on the finished disc. The first thing I look for when buying a new DVD, is the subtitle comment on the back of the case. If none, I don't buy, as I'm sure thousands of other hearing impaired people do the same."
3,NO SUBTITLES !!!,"I'm a big fan of The Shield, but it has the most opaque dialog on TV. They saved some money by not including subtitles. My Season 7 is going back -- it's unwatchable."
3,"Not really a Review, so ignore the number of stars given.","Ok, here is the thing, my family and I (father and brother) are proud fans of The Shield, we started to watch the series on dvd, never saw it on tv, we loved every single minute of the six seasons and were eagerly waiting for the 7th season to hit on dvd, we didn't saw it on tv because we are a Latin family and my dad still has problems to understand spoken English, well, to our surprise the 7th season DOES NOT count with a subtitle option, not even in English, which is rare because during six seasons we enjoyed the series with Spanish subtitles, now we are probably are going to have to skip the final season of a beloved show because no kind of subtitles, even close captions, were included, this is a really big disappoint, I do hope they put on sale a special edition or something like that with a subtitle option, especially when this is a series that has a big appeal to the Latin community."
3,"Amazing show, season 7 poor image quality, no subs.","Was extremely disappointed to find that season 7's image quality was so poor, added to the lack of subtitles - this when the other 6 seasons had uniformly good image quality and subtitles. It really gives the impression that nobody really cared about the production of this one. A real shame for such and important and amazing series. Shame on Sony."
1,Spanish subtitles.,"Once again a final season without subtitles... seems to be that recently final seasons on severals tv shows are only to be seen for those people fluent in English... what a shame!!! Iam a big fans of tv shows and I personally dont have any problem with the language. However, a lot of people I know cant see it without subtitles and it is not fare missing the final after buying all 6 previous seasons."
4,Bloody good show/series,"ONLY one problem, I was sent an ""incorrect region"" version,even though address was plain and clear.Very good show, I have watched it since its' beginning.Good drama, not all the leads are 'goody-two-shoes'THE lead, is the baddest dude of all, his life is a pretext."
4,A satisfying end to a great show,"This season nicely ties up storylines and loose ends from both season 6 and prior seasons. The concluding episode is a satisfying end to the series as Vic gets pretty much what he deserves from his actions during the prior seasons from his coworkers and family. Since I'm writing this review before the DVD release, I'm giving a rating of 4 stars. The show is 5 stars and I hope the extras on the DVD are consistent with the extras found on Seasons 1 through 6 which included episode commentaries, behind the scene features and deleted scenes with commentaries (purchase them too if you haven't already, so watching Season 7 makes sense)"
2,i dont like this guy...,"Greetings fellow amazonians after my debacle with the friday night lights dvd I decided to switch it up and watch the shield. I had seen it briefly along time ago, but I wanted to see the end (my mom always said that the first and last seasons are always the best). After watching the first disk I realized I hated this guy. He reminded me of all the cops that used to patrol watts in la where I grew up. Once I figured out that was what this was about I said thanks, but no thanks and now an trying to get $10 for it from the security guard at the fairgrounds im staying at. He seems like the type of person who will love this"
4,"One Of The Best Shows On TV (Well, It Used To Be)","I have all the seasons of The Shield, and it's one heck of a show. It's got everything; intensity, humor, great acting, and it's very well written. I'm sad to see it go off the air, but then again, it's probably for the best. Most shows that go on for near or over a decade tend to get stale anyway. I have not yet watched any of the series finale, but I did watch the final episode. So I'm anxiously awaiting for this to come out on DVD. Oh, Vic Mackey, I hardly knew thee, but you'll live on in my DVD player."
1,Wrong Zone,I am unable to rate this becuse I can not get it to play on my DVD or Blue Ray. My fault I shuld have checked that it would play in NZ!! I know the series is fantastic I have watched all but Series 7.
5,The final,The shield only follows the Wire for the best law enforcement drama ever created. Outstanding cast and story lines. The cast is all reallt enjoyable to watch.
2,Extremely poor quality DVD.,I wouldn't buy anything else from this company. This DVD was of very poor quality. I threw it out after watching the first episode and decided to watch the rest of the season on Netflix. Better quality and much cheaper.
3,I was shipped two disc 3's!!,"I actually didn't even realize it until I inserted the last disc. I just started the exchange process; so hopefully I shouldn't have any problems since this is mostly a manufacturer's screw-up. Can't blame amazon on this, it was a brand-new product."
3,I Want More!,"I bought this item just for the curiousness I have of the unknown and the mysterious phenomena in life. What I got was a lot of government cover-up stories. I'm not interested in cover-up novels ""show me the money"", tell me about UFO technology, alien powers, and authentic abduction accounts.However, the dvd has some interesting and provocative theories like the surge of UFO appearences during America's atomic weapons testing, which indicates an extraterrestrial interest in man's nuclear feats. Also, the sudden outpouring of advanced technology on earth after Roswell's incident, which is explained due to knowledge gained through UFO wreckage. I personally disagree with the latter theory bacause as a human I strongly believe and trust in our own ingenuity."
3,Good for the price,"This armband fit pretty well to begin with, its starting to stretch out a bit but I've had it for awhile and there is still a decent amount left to fit my arm. The ipod fits well in it as well. My only small complaint is that the plastic cover sometimes makes the wheel had to manuever."
2,Average Product,The plastic on the ipod glove is not user friendly. It is hard to change songs with finger through the plastic.
5,My favorite vegan cookbook,"Great-tasting recipes, quick, and with ingredients that you won't have much trouble to find. I love it !"
1,Don't Bother,"Out of the 224 pages, only 100 pages are (rather large print) recipes. The other pages are basic, common sense information, including the definition of foods like strawberries, etc. Ridiculous! It is more of a nutrition guide than a recipe book. Most of the recipes involve tofu (yuck!). Lots of beverage recipes.The recipes are simple, I give it 1 star for that, but there's nothing in the book I can't make off the top of my head. Very basic recipes. I wouldn't bother with this book. Get ""The Voluptuous Vegan"" instead."
1,boring!!,"These recipes are decidedly lackluster. If you don't know how to cook and are looking for a (very) basic primer in vegan meals, you'll do fine with this one. If, on the other hand, you are looking to go beyond tofu and broccoli with soy sauce, save yourself the trouble. I recommend ""Veganomicon"" or ""Vegan with a Vengeance"" for inspiring and creative vegan recipes."
5,It's just what I wanted.,"Being a new vegan, I wanted simple, inexpensive recipes and I found everything I needed in this book. In other vegan cookbooks the recipes were time consuming and most ingrdients did not fit into my budget. Thank you Debra and Amazon"
3,"i was excited, at first.","when i had decided to become vegan, i bought this book. i was excited by the lifestyle change, and bound and determined to begin the quest for animal-free cuisine. i tried some recipies from this book and, to be fair, i will say i haven't tried many (a clue right there - i love to cook) but the ones i did try, let's say, did'nt help make the transition easy. i felt as if i was depriving myself. in fact, i think i was actually crying while i ate one of the dishes out of this book - unsatisfying / no taste/ vomit inducing (was i detoxing, so soon?) is this what vegan fare tastes like? i thought,deprevation? not the book if you care about flavors and passionate cooking."
2,title?,"Who the hell names a book: ""Simply Vegan: Quick Vegetarian Meals""Does this contain vegan recipes, or vegetarian recipes? Way to confuse potential buyers, Deb."
2,"cute stories, weak animation","The animation for this video is just crappy. While the adventures that Morecock goes own are sexy, watching them in poor animation is a strain. Unless you are just a die hard fan of this series, I recommend you spend your money on something else."
1,The worst DVD I have ever had the misfortune to buy.,"Don't waste your money. This is the most pathetic, up-hyped, piece of rubbish I have ever wasted my money on. Pathetic story lines by a director who wishes to promote his artistry.Joe - stick to your magnificent drawings - God forbid there might be a 'House of Morecock - The Twin Cocks' followed by 'House of Morecock - return of the Queen'.I certainly got ripped off here - you wanna offer me a refund???????????????? Seriously."
1,Simple terrible!,"I am an animator, this is terrible. The images are bad, the animation is poor, the stories are ""not great""(I am watching my language), simply not something worth spending the money, I literally tossed into the trash in my recent spring cleaning. It got one star because ZERO star is not an aption, I would not give it even one star! I DON'T RECOMMEND IT AT ALL!!!!"
5,great,"i met crystal lacey winslow in a bookstore at a mall in maryland. she persuaded me to buy the book and signed it for me. i started reading it that day and finished that night! not only is she beautiful, she is smart, sweet, and can write!"
5,This book was off the HOOK!!!!,"Big ups!! Ms. Winslow, this book was worth the wait. I loved it. What a follow up to Life, Love and Loneliness. I have recommended this to so many people and every one loved the first one when they read it. I read Criss Cross in 2 days what a great book. I will definitely recommend The Criss Cross also, But they have to get their own. No sharing!! Give the author her props the right way. In her pockets!! I was very dissapointed when I finished the book. I wanted it to go on forever. Continued success!!! Ms. Winslow. Please write a sequel to The Criss Cross there are still so many unanswered questions."
3,Too much drama?,"I really enjoyed Life, Love, and Loneliness, even though I thought that it had more drama than necessary; however it was still a page turner. I'm kind of disappointed about the Criss Cross. Some of the drama was way over the top, and I think ties from the previous book could have been a lot better. It wasn't a page turner book for me, but if you like street, urban, or drama books then you will probably enjoy it."
1,Horrible,Why is this woman even an author? This book was garbage. Too many characters that you never really connect too and a BS storyline. You need to get out of the book game because you are not a true storyteller. This was the worst book I have ever read. All of the Nikkisi was Nokisi was stupid. She tried to be too different on this one. DO NOT BUY.
2,"Not very ""Baroque"" and not my taste","This may be good for some people but I really didn't like it:I thought it was not played in the Baroque style. I personally hate vibrato and this had a lot of it. It made it the slow movements very annoying for me to listen to. I admit I might be a little obsessed but vibrato really ruins a performance for me.It was played with ""heavy fingers"" especially on the violins. This was a very ""romantic"" interpertaion for me.A much better performance in my opinion is one directed by Hogwood and performed by Manze (Uni/Decca - #458129) which was performed on ""authentic"" instruments."
3,Good General Intro - but getting quite dated,"This is a good general introduction to the white wines of the world. The book itself was written in 1996, so the specific vineyards, vintages, and even market trends have shifted somewhat over the last 15 years, including the loss of some of the top suggestions. Setting the age of the book aside for a moment, the material about white wines in general is easy to digest, and provides the reader with enough information to be able to be reasonably intelligent on varietals and general information. A good intro."
1,Hard to read,This book is extremely hard to read because of the small print--some lines are squeezed together and the print becomes even smaller. The reader needs to be aware that this book is dry and much like a text book. The author concentrates so much time on her lifestory. There are many other books about spirituality that are positive and uplifting for the reader to enjoy.
1,Damaged cover,The book came through with a flimsy paper wrap and was damaged during delivery. Otherwise OK.
5,A Spirtual Experience,"I enjoyed reading this book. I found the writing to be calming and uplifting... a way to reconnect with what's important. The whole book can be viewed as a spiritual tool as well as the components which include suggested methods/sources, etc. Although it is a hefty book (400+ pages I believe), I was sorry to see it come to an end. I would heartily recommend this book to others! Thanks, Elizabeth, for sharing so much of your personal journey and your far-reaching wisdom!"
4,A nice overview.,"Elizabeth Lesser, co-founder of Omega Institute, gives a good over view of what to think about as you seek a spiritual life."
3,Great Inspiration; Print is far too small....,"I am approaching my 50's and one of the first things that changed was my vision. This being such a wonderful book for those in their ""wisdom"" years, I would like to recommend that it is reprinted and made available in LARGE print. I am really challenged with the fine print and the word congestion on each page. Thank you for the consideration!"
4,Good Book- focuses heavily on meditation,"The author makes some great points about spirituality in America today. However, the ""seeker"" wil find that meditation is the primary guidance the author presents."
3,Didn't like the cover and paper quality,"Great book, great author. It gave me a lot of insight, I actuall want to read it again, I am sure I will again find a lot of new insights... Highly recommend it for those who are looking for a lift of heart and soul..."
3,Not as satisfying as I expected,"This really was as advertised, a didactic, this is what you should do type book. I had read her other book, Broken Open, which I thoroughly enjoyed. It was like having a conversation with someone I could completely relate to and who was sharing from her heart. I was not really looking for THIS type of book and that explains my disappointment. If you are looking for this, she does deliver."
3,A Struggling Seeker,"I am about two-thirds into The Seeker's Guide. I read 10 - 20 pages per day. The subject matter is very interesting to me. However, I'm finding the writing tedious. I often re-read exerpts and have difficulty with Ms. Lesser's personal reactions to everything she has experienced. I find myself wanting to know her experiences but not her evaluation. She's traveled a phenomonal path and I'm anxious to learn about her evolvement, relationships, travels and teachers. Just as I begin to have some vicarious experience, I'm thrown off by another personal opinion she has. I find it distracting. To me, it feels like she wrote more for her personal gratification and not so much to assist the reader in a search for spirituality. Still valuable stuff!"
3,Not really to my taste,"Instead read Broken Open. It's what promoted me to buy this book. It was recommended that if I like an author I buy all the books form this person and read them. Nope. Not in this case, it did not pan out well.http://www.amazon.com/Broken-Open-Difficult-Times-Help/dp/0375759913/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1357859385&sr;=1-1&keywords;=broken+open"
4,Pleasant Background Music for Work and Study,"More Mozart for your Mind is a generally pleasant collection of pieces which I find makes a nice backdrop for my work and reading. The works (Sonata in A, Serenade No. 10 in B-flat, Divertimento No. 11) are familiar, relaxing, and enjoyable. St. Martin in the Fields and the English Chamber Orchestra provide good performances, and Phillips quality is present. I did find the Piano Concerto No. 24 in c a bit jarring, and the Sinfonia Concertante in E-flat was very dynamic and could be distracting to a more sensitive listener."
2,Simple but is it the truth,"Dr Day - on her website and her tapes - she never once mentions Jesus Christ and how to be saved, but says she is a Christians. In the video she only states 9 of these 'health' 10 points.Overall she covers:1 Nutrition - plenty of veg, juicing and water - all day long2 Rules on eating basically - don't eat vegetables and fruits at the same meal3 Taking rest and avoiding fat (sugar + meat)4 Get out and about - sunlight, air and exersize...and thats itNow about this false teachers claims of healing cancer...she's lying...she clearly states she had her tumor removed via an operation. Avoided chemo treatment - knowing FULL WELL that it would kill anyone who takes it. Its a money making business - cancer for the drug companies.Most doctors will tell you to cut out MEAT if you get cancer as it feeds the fungus of cancer. This is nothing new."
3,It was ok...,"This was decent anime. The music was somewhat cheesy and poor. Kudos on a cool villian, who somewhat redeemed the ""mad boomers."" The concept was cool, but I'm not a fan of the show over all."
5,Even the Cynic Will Be Impressed!,"If you've long thought, ""Chakra Shmakra! What a bunch of hooey!"", think again...and again, and again. Myss will change your mind and your heart about where your power is and how you ARE using it--whether you think so or not. She is so intelligent and speaks with such genuine intensity and humor, one cannot help but learn and grow from listening to her. I've read several of her books and listened to several tapes; she is always inspiring and enlightening and challenging."
1,Only wore twice and it stop working,Less than 2 months after getting watch stop working. Since I have many watches I only got to wear twice. It didnt fall or take a knock it just stopped working. Too bad because it was a nice looking watch.
5,Great price for a really good product.,"These labels do what they were designed to do. They stick well, too. It is easy to design your words to fit on using the label menu on Word. You can even use color if you design your label in a word doc. and then copy it into the label part of the program."
1,Too tight!,I've been buying the blue denim version of this pant for some time. Love it. But this version (black) is much tighter. Beware...
3,"Different fit for different washes, what???","I do not know what happened to the quality and sizing of Levi's 569's. My husband is extremely picky about his jeans and only wears 569's. The last two times we tried to buy a new set, we were so disappointed with the quality and fit of his beloved number. We picked several different washes, thinking, of course you don't need to try them on, they will fit! This was not the case. Each wash fitted differently and his usual waist size of 32 was huge on him in these ""new"" jeans. What is wrong with Levi's? You can't change the fit of your jeans when people expect a certain standard for ""their"" number that they expect to fit perfectly but then, they DON'T!"
3,Small front pockets - this pair only,"The particular pair of jeans I received had small front pockets (smaller than my other pairs of Levi 569 jeans) with one front pocket being smaller than the other. Other than that the jeans were fine. I recieved them in new condition with no defects. I just have to think twice now before wearing them because of the smaller front pockets. All in all I still like my loose fitting 569's. I'll leave the new style tight ones or ""skinny jeans"" to the girls, 12 year old boys and rock stars.."
3,Nice look Quality off....,"As usual Levis fit well. My only problem is that these jeans aren't sturdy like the previous models.Its the quality you expect from a $12 jeans.Wash on delicate cycle if you want them to last.Product delivered on time!!!Aug 30 ,2010Just tried the other jeans, though the tags are the same they are very different.The legs are about 3 inches narrower so the pants fits tight. I don't know what is happening to Levis, but they seriously need to look at quality control.If i wanted tight jeans i would not have ordered ""straight loose"". I live in the Caribbean so i cant send them back."
1,"um, who were these designed for? They must have an interesting body shape.","As MANY, MANY, people have said these are cut all wrong, and elastic in the fabric? oh, joy. The are baggy in the waist [+2 inches of advertized size, I measured] but tight in the hips/ upper thigh, which makes them creep down.For a very long time, I could walk in to any store and buy levis that fit... and even if there was a bit of variation in sizing, it wasn't bad. Because of that I was able to order online w/o issues, but those days are long past. If you hold these up next to my old 569's [that are alas, totalled], you can see how the sizing is all wrong."
1,Muy malos Levis 569,"Levi's Men's 569 Loose Straight Leg JeanHola a todos, yo compre un Levis 569 porque en la descripcion decia Made in Cambodia, pero recibo en mi pais un Levis MAde in Mexico, me parece muy mal que engañen a la gente de esa forma, además estos levis 569 estan muy malos,de mala calidad, no recomiendo comprar."
1,"Yep, the new cut is terrible....","My favorite jean has been the 569 for years. I have to order online since I wear 34x36. After reading the bad reviews of the new cut, I went to JCP to try on a pair of 569 34x34 and they felt fine. Well the 34x36 I purchased here are not fine. They sit too low on the hips; I had to cinch my belt an extra hole to keep them up. The worst part is there's an uncomfortable wad of fabric between my upper thighs. I dont mind that they are less loose, but the hip/crotch area is not close to what they used to be...feh! Why would they change the cut so radically??"
1,Knock-off junk - not the real thing,"I ordered these, exact same style and size of Levis that I have from Dillards, I no longer live in an area with a Dillards and thought that since I knew the size and style I could just order them online. Boy was I wrong. These are some chinese knock-off junk, the material is much thiner than the real thing and the fit is absolutely terrible, it is so bad I just had to laugh. I will never buy jeans online agian and warn others to stay away! Go to a reputable retailer or just buy from Levis direct, it only will cost a couple of bucks more and then you know you have the real thing."
2,Not the same as stores,"I have bought multiple versions (i.e. color) of these jeans over the past six months or so at different stores. When I got the pair of jeans that I ordered from Amazon, I found that they fit tighter than any that I bought in the stores - mainly in the crotch area. I could not really tell that much of a difference between the fabric. I returned them to Amazon and just bought a pair at Dillards."
1,poor quality,"My son has worn Levi 569 jeans for years. I purchased three pairs for him a few months ago. He's only worn them a few times and the belt loop by the label has ripped off on all three pairs!! He also told me that they are very tight in the crotch area like several of you have mentioned here. I'm so disappointed, we are going to have to look for another pair of comfortable jeans."
1,THIN & CHEAP LOOKING,"These jeans were listed as Gray rigid, I have 2 pair of the dark Blue Rigid Jeans and the material is a lot thicker than these flimsy, thin, khaki type jeans. Very disapponited. Sure these are not knock off Levi;'s?"
2,discription,"this is the worst levis i ever had i will never buy another, and i live in trinidad so the cost to return it will make no sense to me."
2,Inaccurate fit,I always wear size 36 jeans but when I received this jeans it was too big. I paid so much for it I cannot even wear it. It is very disappointing.
4,"Nice look, thin material","These fit me well and I like the color, but the material is very thin and will wear out quickly."
1,Length is off,"I bought these jeans in the same size as the ones my husband already owns from a few years ago. After washing this pair, they ended up being about an inch shorter than the 569's he already has. Not sure what has happened to this style of jean in the last year or so, but we had to return these as my husband wasn't interested in a pair of flood pants. We would've ordered the next size up except they do not sell a long enough pant for his 6'5"" frame."
2,Very strange fit. Light weight fabric. Returned them!,"I've worn Levis for years. For the last 8 years it's been 550 or the 559. I looked at the fit chart on the Levis web site and decided to try the loose fit in the same size.The pants I received felt strange. They were loose in the waist, tight in the seat and the back pockets felt like they were in the wrong place. The fabric was light weight. Not at all what I expect from Levis or what their chart shows. The waist measured 2 inches above what the label shows. My wife said they looked odd.I returned them and purchased the same size in Lee jeans relaxed fit. Fit and look great. Much better fabric. Amazon made the return easy and painless."
3,What's up with the size?,"The jeans are quite nice, but I really don't understand what's up with the size. I've been wearing Levi's Jeans for years and I could allways rely on the size. The length is fine of course but the waist size says 42 but it's way too big. I've got other pairs of Levi's or other jeans that have the size 42 and fit me perfectly and these are really too big. So in the end I gave them to my dad who normally wears size 44, fit him perfectly, so no harm done. But how am I supposed to know that they are bigger? Or does the word ""loose"" mean that every size is actually bigger?"
1,The style definitely changed.,The style of these jeans definitely changed. I do not like the newer style. Not loose. Low hips. These are not the 569s of the past.
1,I won't buy any jeans from Amazon anymore.,I love Levi's 569. Only jeans I wear. But my last purchase from Amazon was totally garbage. This is not 569 I used to wear. I did not want to waste my time and did not sent them back. Wearing them for dirty works like painting or changing oil of my car.Never would buy any clothing from Amazon.
3,Fabric is very thin not like your orignal Levi's,"Levi's Men's 569 Loose Straight Leg Jean, Black, 36x30arrived ok, packaging was good but the Quality of the fabric is not what I expected,,, unless Levi's has changed their fabric this can not be an original Levi's"
4,"Nice Pair of jeans... good fit, nice color, and great fit for a big guy.","Nice Pair of jeans... good fit, nice color, and great fit for a big guy. Ice cap color goes with all my shirts and pullovers. I would buy them again."
4,Levi's 569 'Rugged',"I love the 569 category from Levi's. I've been wearing these since 2002, they are a great fit. No matter what weight I am at, I can never fit into 501's(at least not comfortably); too tight around the thighs and seat. These 569's are looser and give a comfortable fit for people who aren't built like twigs.I would give 5 stars, however the material that Levi's uses is not as durable or thick as the 569's I purchased in the early 2000's. Those pairs, which were worn a lot by me, are still holding up nicely. The Levi's which I bought a couple years later, with the less durable material, has worn down more quickly. Still, 569's look nice and fit well."
2,569's Use to be a great option,"We used to purchase 569's for my son who is very athletic and has large muscular thighs. They had a more modern fit than ""relaxed"" jeans, which come up the waist too high and taper at the ankles. Then we noticed that Levi started to make these tighter and they are no longer as comfortable. We've switched to The Gap ""loose"" fit, which are like the old 529 fit, although the material is softer and in some ways nicer."
3,Same Jeans Wrong Colour,"I'm a 569 fan. That's all I've worn for years. Can never get them in Black. So when I saw Black available I rushed to order. But they""re blue when they arrive. I'm out of country so the process to return takes too long. Stuck with another pair of blue jeans. Happy with the product, just disappointed about the colour."
1,Thanks for showing me the error of my ways Levi!,"Thank god I am finally out of this rut. Didn't realize that for the last ten years how much I HATED being able to buy the same jeans without trying them on every few months. You're right Levi, I WASN'T comfortable wearing only your jeans, and I DIDN'T like giving you my money. I have found my new passion in life, instead of spending my weekends video gaming, and cooking, and hanging out with friends I really wanted to be SHOPPING for a new brand of jeans to be loyal to.Thank you Levi, thank you."
4,Good transaction,Everything for the purchasing and receiving of this gift went well-- but these jeans fit differently than the ones I have bought historically that are the same type-- they now wear/fit lower on the hips which is a little awkward at time.
2,Long Inches,"I don't know what kind of inch they use at Levi's but the 30x30 I received has a 36-inch waist. Either that or (more likely) this is a mislabeled irregular pair. I was looking for something similar to a pair of 30x30 loose Levi Strauss Signature jeans I got at Target. These are nowhere as loose as the ones from Target. I wonder how much tighter these would have been if I got an actual 30x30 in this style. I'd return them but I never wear clothes unwashed. On the plus side, they don't seem to shrink. The waist and length seem no different from the other pair I haven't washed."
3,low riders,"These jeans fit nice everywhere except for the waist in the back. I feel like those young girls or a plumber because even though my belt is notched all the way tight, the way these jeans are designed when you bend over the back of the jeans slide down your rear producing quite a show. Basically, if you have a bubble butt, then these jeans are not the ones for you."
3,Levi's,Levi's are not made like they were 7 to 10 years ago when they were made in USA now the size is not correct and the sewing work looks bad. They are made in other country's for cheep labor and thats what you get a cheep product that cost like it was made in the USA..
3,Levi Jeans,"I am happy about the time frame I received my order, however, I am unhappy and very disappointed that they were not exactly the style as described on the site. The description was a bit misleading, i thought they were the button fly Levis by how they were described, however they zip rather then button. The ONLY reason I bought these jeans was because I thought they were complete button fly!"
1,"Same number, different cut.","These used to be my go-to jeans, anytime I needed a new pair, I could buy my size and know they'd fit well. Not anymore, the new cut is completely different. Levis, why did you change the cut? Hopefully they'll change back after enough negative criticism, but I'm not holding my breath. I guess I'll be buying another brand of jeans from here on out, I'm sure as hell not investing time into finding another perfect fitting Levis when they have proven they will change the cut on a whim."
1,Poor quality control.,"I've purchased these 569s both on Amazon and at a Levi's Company Store. The sizing is highly variable. When I went to the store, I tried on a pair of jeans which fit quite well. I grabbed two extra pairs that were the same size and cut, but in a different color. Both pairs that I neglected to actually try on were much smaller and did not fit well at all. I still like the jeans, but would never buy them again without trying them on first."
1,jeans,Men's jeans do not have the depth in the crotch/seat they used to. They are short ride. It is hard to keep the jeans up to one's waist even with a belt.
1,Not the real 569 cut - Levis changed it,"If you have like me, been buying 569's for years and usually buy a supply every so often, then think again as the 'new' 569 cut is completely different. Rather than create a new cut with a new number, Levis completely changed the sizing and cut of the 569, and they are now skinnier and made of thinner material.I'm now back to trying other brands to see if I can find anything comparable as the new cut just doesn't fit, and I don't like the thin, cheap denim being used either. 560's still fit but are way to high in the waist. Very disappointed with Levis."
1,Boooo! to the new 569,"Anyone who is a long time fan of the levi's 569 beware. Levi's have decided to completely change the cut of this jean and not change the number, so what used to be the 569 is very different from what they are selling now. They are a great deal tighter in the seat and thigh, so the relaxed fit is not nearly as generous. Also they are much lower at the waist almost making them low cut jeans.. For some, this may be exactly what you want, but for those who are long time buyers of this style expect to be disappointed. Shame on levis for pulling the switch. I think if you change the style you should change the number so people know what they are getting. Unfair and confusing of them to keep the number but not they style. I am shipping mine back immediately."
1,Dissapointed in Levi's changes,"I called Levi's to see why they are now low on the hips. They informed me people called and asked us to. I said, well people that LIKED the way they fit weren't calling!?! Why don't they make NEW designs, instead of changing what people like!?! We also had to get 2 pairs. 1st pair the seam went across the front of your leg, instead of the side. They were also super long. I am so dissapointed. I told Levi's we are going to have go to another company, there isn't anything left for my husband with them. They don't have anything to replace these now that they are changed. On a side note for people smaller sized they said the closest thing to these are Silvertab Levi's. Sadly, they don't make them up to 44, they stop at 42."
1,tight jeans,I have another pair same dimensions and it fits totally different. This one is tight. Levis sizing is not consistent. Stay away.
2,Levis alternative,"I have found a product that fits similar to the old 569s, Try buying the Redhead loose fit or utility jeans at Bass proshops. I dont buy levis anymore too. I hope they bring back the old one..."
1,Color??,I will only comment on the 'Vintage Light' color-it's not even close to the picture on the description. It's way way darker. They arrived looking a tad lighter than regular 501's. I checked the tags and they were in fact 'Vintage Light'. Bad. Don't waste your time. It's so hard to find a light pair of jeans. Look elsewhere.
1,What was Levi Strauss thinking?,"I liked the old 569s. I hate the new ones. I recently tried on a pair and was like ""What is this @#!!?"" I then looked at the price tag and was like ""oh, hell no!"" I don't like the ""skinny look"" and based on the feedback I've read so far, I'm not alone. I'm not some hipster,""emo"", swag dork or any other type of trendy, garden variety cornball. When one considers that Levi-Strauss has other jeans which cater to the ""skinny"" crowd (most of them wear their sister's or girlfriend's jeans anyway), one is left asking ""Why the 569s""? Outside of the old 569s the only other pants I rock consistently are Dickies. It looks like I'll be adding Carhartt Jeans back to my wardrobe (I rocked that brand consistently in the early 90s). Does anyone have any other suggestions?"
4,Great jeans at a great price,"I'm always reluctant to purchase pants online, but these jeans were exactly as I expected and had a great fit."
1,cheap,These jeans are like a cheap version of the real thing. Not like they used to be made. Not sure if its the store or just the way levi's are made now.
2,Unreliable fit,Do yourself a favor and go to your nearest department store to try on the pair of jeans you intend to purchase. Even purchases from Levi's website vary from the stated sizes.
5,Perfect fit jeans,My husband loves these levi jeans. Loves the rugged look and color. He won't wear anything else.They fit very comfortable.
1,Worst purchase on Amazon,These were skin tight. I may as well have bought skinny jeans for what I got on this. Are there no more baggy Silvertabs available?
2,Not very Loose,"I purchased these Levis 569 Loose fit jeans because these are the closest jeans I could find that are like the old Levi Silver Tab Baggy jeans. I workout a lot and my thighs are larger than normal peoples, fashion trends seem to be going to these ""skinny"" jeans. So these were way too tight for my liking, not a lot of room. I personally dont like these jeans. If youre the ""average"" size person they would probably work well, but if youre more athletically built. Stay away. Ive sent mine back."
2,Droopy drawers.,"Loose? But, Mister Levi, the waist is supposed to be 33, not 34. Yes, a full inch of air where air shouldn't be. Have to wear a belt: If I don't, the pants drop down to my knees. These are LOOSE."
1,GIRLY PANTS,"WHAT HAPPENED TO NORMAL GUY JEANS 569, THESE ARE SO TIGHT MY WIFE CAN WERE THEM , BRING BACK THE OLD STYLE"
3,Sizing off,"Before ordering these jeans, I took measurements to make sure I was buying the right size. A 31 waist size should have fit me perfectly, however they were quite loose and falling down. Levi's needs to work on their sizing controls as they are way off. Other than that, the pants are comfortable and look good."
2,Come on . . . consistency,"I agree about model numbers. Levis used to make Loose Relaxed, which I thought were perfect. Low rise, nice and baggy. They apparently discontinued them and now if there's something the same or similar there's no way to tell. You know the size and style you want, you should be able to find them with no problem. Is 569 cut the same???"
1,Not the right size.,I own several pairs of 569 jeans in other colors. These are a completely different size and cut - short and misshapen.
4,Not so bad.,"I am changing my opinion on these jeans. I actually made a comment agreeing with a bad review on the jeans. I bought these as a gift for my husband based on a pair of jeans he already has. When we got these the material was very thin and the waist was much lower than the original 569 and I agreed that the quaility wasn't the same and Levi's should change the # on the style if they are going to change the jeans. HOWEVER, as an update I can tell you, now that my husband has worn these for a while they are now his FAVORITE jeans. I still agree that Levi's should change the number on the style so you don't expect the same jeans but the product is just fine. My husband is an oilfield electrician so he moves quite a bit and he said these pants are very comfortable."
2,Too large,"I'm 48 and have been wearing the same size since high school. (32/34) In spite of ordering the exact same size of Levi's 569, they arrived after about a week and a half and they are too big. I'm finding that Levi's have grown larger with time, probably to appease the heavier population and make everyones self esteem better. I'll have to find a 31/34 cuz I'm getting skinnier. They're being returned."
1,Are these really 569's?????,"My son asked for a pair of black 569's for his birthday. I can no longer find black in the stores, so I ordered a pair online. I thought the pants seemed very ""light"" when they arrived, but didn't think much of it. After my son had pulled the tags off and wore them for a couple hours he mentioned the fabric was not the usual heavier denim and seemed to keep getting looser. Turns out, the fabric is STRETCH DENIM, like you would find in women's jeans, REALLY??? My son has worn the 569's for years and was VERY dissappointed."
1,Levis 569 Lighter Fabric not what they used to be.,These jeans have exactly the same tag as my old ones. Made in Cambodia same patent numbers and everything. However they are totally different thicknesses. Which means they will wear out faster then my old ones. This is obviously a way to cut costs on production to use half the material and to make you have to buy an expensive pair of jeans more often. Levis has lost a loyal customer of over 20 years.
1,Terrible size,"I bought 2 pants and waist 33Wx30L is inconceivably larger, I think that 36 at least, I have other pants and have compared the same size and are smaller. Please improve quality control. If you buy select at least one waist size less than."
2,Did Levi's Change the Cut on the 569 Jeans?,"The Levi's 569 jeans are the only jeans that I wear. I purchased the Tumbled Merlin 569's and they don't feel like the other pairs that I have. The material feels thinner, and there doesn't seem to be as much room in the legs as my older pairs. A visual inspection shows that there is more material in the legs in my older jeans. Upon trying them on, they did not fit well and were returned."
5,excellent original,Perfect fit correct size and lengthoriginal tags and shipped very quick tracking number was provided as ssson as possible. only one little problem i think it could have shipped in a smaller box as half of the box was empty.
2,Material and cut questionable,I have worn Levis for years. This style does not fit in a similar fashion to previous 569's. The material also feels extremely thin and not as durable as their previous lines. I would not recommend these jeans.
3,could be better....,These jeans are too loose for my liking. The vintage look they have is desirable but their baggy nature detracts from their quality. I would recommend the 514 slim straight jeans by Levi's.
2,Jeans are not black,I'm not sure what color Black Amped is supposed to be but it's not black. It's dark blue. The size fits nicely.
1,"Thin, cheap, not at all what was expected","Returned for a hassle free refund immediately!!! Not the quality of the jeans we would normally find at the store and wear. They looked like discount store, no brands ... Or worse. And we are no youngsters and have worn Levi's for many, many years."
1,Don't Buy!,"The quality of these pants are poor at best. Never will I by levi's again. Better going to Wal-mart, or a second hand store!!!"
1,Not true to size(length),"These jeans are absolutely NOT true to size. I don't know if they are ""knock off"" Levi's or what, but my son wears a 32"" length in ALL jeans and these are high waters on him. Terribly disappointed."
4,Good jeans,"These are a good pair of jeans. Got the jagger style, always got compliments on them, I did like the pattern. But unfortunately just a few months after getting I lost weight and they are too loose now. I gave 4 stars just because they are a little thinner than the last 569's I bought. Now need to get more in a smaller size. Seller shipped fast."
1,Not your Typical Levis,"Not sure what's up with the Levis from Amazon, but these are not the same as from the Levi's store. I've worn the 569 series, same size, for years and years now, and I recently was at the Levi's store, which had them on sale for by 2 and pay $39.99 ea. So I thought I'd save a few bucks on taxes and order them through Amazon for the same price.When I got them in the mail, even though the label indicted the same size as I normally wear, they were much bigger (1-2 inches), the cut didn't feel right, and even the label looked wrong and was poorly sewn onto the jean.I'm no expert, nor am I qualified to spot a fake, but in my personal opinion, these were either the worst pair of Levi Jeans that Levi's has ever put together, or these were knock-offs.I will certainly not attempt to buy these again through Amazon."
2,Men's 569 style is no longer the same,We have encountered the same problem others have mentioned here. The 569 style is no longer the same as it was before. My son had 3 pairs of 569's that I bought quite awhile ago. It was time to replace them. We went and bought another 3 pairs. He didnt want to try them on in the store and I didnt feel it necessary as they were the same style and same size as before. All 3 pairs are tight in the upper thigh/crouch/groin area and had to go back. How disappointing that they changed the cut of the jean. Why not create a different style # being they are a different jean? I am very disappointed.
1,These are not the Levis I remember,"I used to like Levi jeans for their comfort and durability. The 569s, in particular, I appreciated for the extra roominess. Well, that's all gone. These are made with fabric about as heavy as a polo shirt. They're also not 100% cotton anymore, as they now have threads of ""elastane"" sewn into them. On top of that, whoever redesigned them has a dysfunctional sense of the word ""loose"". So that's what Levi is now: lightweight, skinny, stretch pants."
3,Different Cut - Not As Loose Fittng as They Once Were.,Levi's has definitely changed the cut of the 569 jeans. They are now much tighter than they used to be.
2,Fit is very poor,"I have bought maybe 6 pairs of these jeans at a retail store, so I know how they are supposed to fit. This pair was supposed to be a 34 by 34. The tag says 34 by 34. They fit like a 38 by 34. Not worth the hassle to mail back, so I'll just wear a belt."
1,Sizing?,I wear 34 x 36 and have for 30 years. The waist on these pants that say 34 must be a 36. The fit of these pants is a joke!
1,"Hardly ""Loose"" -- except in the waist.","I've worn Levi's 559 jeans for years and years. A couple of weeks ago I went and bought a couple new pairs, and they didn't fit at all. They were tight in the thighs and loose in the waist. So I returned to the store and exchanged them for a couple of pairs of 569's.The 569's are looser in the thighs, but reading reviews here I gather that they used to be much looser. But the waist is RIDICULOUS. Inches to spare. So I measured my 32L 32W Levi's 569 jeans. Over 36 inches!So I measured the other pair of 32W jeans. Also over 36 inches.What kind of body type is Levi's designing for these days? Pin legs, no butt, and a bulbous waist? All I can say is ""Thank goodness that they don't fit me!"".Clearly Levi's aren't going to work for me anymore. Does anybody have a suggestion for another brand and model of jeans that are decent quality, a Relaxed or Loose fit, and designed for reasonably fit human beings?"
2,Changed rise since my last pair of 4 years ago....,"I ordered a few of these, as I had a pair already, and I thought that I found a good 'standard' jean that I could always have available to buy. They shortened the rise on them though. This may not be an issue for some people, but when you are tall (34x36), short rise is not your friend. Luckily I found a similar fitting and looking jean (compared to the old 569's), JC Penney's Arizona Boot-cut jeans. Longer rise, loose fit, and about half the price if you get them on sale. Check those out if you are a tall guy."
1,Anyone have contact info to lodge complaints about the 569 changes?,"569 loose straight is all I wear and this new sizing is not for me, I do not wear skinny jeans and this is what the 569 has now turned into.For those who have lodged complaints directly to Levi in hopes for them to return to the classic 569 loose straight please post it hear so we all can voice our displeasure."
3,not usual Levis quality.,I have to say that I'm very disappointed in Levis quality lately. The last 2 pr. of Jeans that I bought for my Son have had the belt loops rip off within the first week. This has not been the norm for Levis over the years. I am used to receiving a quality product from the Levis co. Perhaps it's time to start looking for another brand. The service and shipping were great though.
1,NOT LEVI's quality,"SHOULD HAVE PAID ATTENTION TO THE OTHER REVIEWERS THAT GAVE THIS ITEM ONLY 1 STAR!!! I thought product was probably incorrectly labeled. Bought 30x32 but received equivalent to 28x30. Jeans were too short and too tight at the bum even though size should have been slack - forget the ""loose"" description for this item! Also, denim quality is poor, more expected of a cheap no-brand pair of jeans. Definitively NOT the Levi jeans FIT/QUALITY we are used to!"
1,dissapointed,"I thought that these would be the same as the 569's I had bought a couple months ago at a local retail store. They were my first Levi's that I've ever bought. I thought that the ones I had purchased recently were the ones made with the thinner material and different cuts mentioned in the reviews on here; however, this is not the case. These 569's are of really poor quality, and not worth the money at all. I definitely will not be buying 569's ever again. Wrangler's are much better than this...if only they fit the way the old 569's used to..."
2,very large,"buy the same size as always in Levi's, the pants I remain very large, about 2 sizes too.I could not use the pants and I sold it."
3,Good fit but it's not black,"I was searching for black jeans and used the filter to narrow the search. These jeans came up and were a good look. Other reviews spoke of a slimmed than expected fit but since that is what I was looking for, I didn't mind. The picture looked a little blue but I thought maybe it was my screen or the wrong picture. When it came...I was wrong. The jeans were BLUE...not BLACK! So now I have a million...and one...blue jeans.Nevertheless, the jeans are comfortable and fit well. iI haven't worn it much...since I have other choices...so I will get back to this. For now, beware...it's not BLACK."
5,i love it,I love being able to buy all sizes and colors of Levis in one place..... I just love it. Thank you
5,Good quality,"I bought these for my husband and he's impressed with them. They fit true to size, great quality, very elegant and relaxed."
2,Quality is not what you would expect from Levi's,"The 569 is the perfect fit for me. I have larger thighs, so it makes it harder for me to find the right pair of jeans.While they look nice, these jeans do not have the quality that I have come to expect from Levi's. I started noticing thin spots in the denim only five months after purchasing them, and holes after six. I expected these to last at least a year. Sadly, I have to donate these.If you expect them to only last a few months, then these jeans are a decent buy. If you expect longer lasting jeans, look elsewhere."
1,really???,Ordered twice and both pairs of jeans had holes in them. Why would you not advertise that the jeans had holes drilled in them. I'm not 15 and I want pants that will last. really disapointed
3,"Different fit, still decent pants","I had read the reviews on Amazon several times, and it caused me not to order these pants for a while. Eventually, both of my in use 569s were just too worn to delay my purchase any longer. I bit the bullet, and bought a pair.I can confirm, like others have mentioned, that this does not feel like a 569 cut. There is a lot less room pretty much everywhere. Because of my need for a new pair of pants, I decided to keep them. They aren't as comfortable as the previous 569 cut I loved so much, but they are breaking in slowly but surely.I haven't found there to be any quality issues in terms of the material being thin or feeling cheap. My pair feel like a well made pair of pants, and I anticipate that they will last the standard amount of time.The only reason I give them 3 stars is because they fit very differently than the 569s that you think you will be getting. Because most people buy a style of jeans based on past experience, I think that is a fair rating."
1,never buying levis again,"I am very active and use to buy these all the time becasue of leg room. Now they changed the cut and I cant wear them comfortably as before. They clam its a "" style change"" well i changed my style to the LEE Dungerees carpenter jeans which have a lot more leg room stronger heavier duty denim and now im a changed man no more levi's for me."
3,"Good fitting, faded front",The picture doesn't show the front legs being faded. I think that look is dopey. They fit well. The extra room is appreciated.
2,Men's Levi's 569 jeans,"The item fit poorly, almost like it was a different style. However, I own 3 other pairs of 569 jeans, all of which I bought at a regular store after trying them on, and they're great. Lesson learned. It's tough to buy clothes online because you don't know exactly how they will fit.I give this item 2 stars, but overall, I give 569 jeans 5 stars."
1,Completely Disappointed!,"Being a fan of the ""Old"" 569 Straight leg Loose jeans I took a shot at ordering this new style. I had read some of the negative reviews but took a chance on them anyhow. Now after receiving them I wish I hand't wasted my time with these and I'm still left wondering what the hell Levi's is thinking. Thin material, shallow pockets, tight fitting, and just all around uncomfortable. I hope to find another style that fits like the Old 569's."
1,These are a mess. Basically cheap skinny jeans.,569 was my favorite jean however these are nothing like them. They pretty much fit like skinny jeans with wide ankles. Very tight in the crotch..very uncomfortable. Doesn't look too sexy either.Pretty sad about it.
2,Levis 569 - Not what its made out to be!,I believe this to be a sorry excuse for 569 Jeans. I have beeen using 569s for in excess of 15 years and never had an issue with the fit until recently. I wish someone could explain what the heck has gone wrong with levis. There is nothing loose and straight about these jeans now that you have cut off half the material and given purchasers tights with flare bottoms. To make things worse the already low waist has been brought even lower. I had to return the purchase.I would have been happy to know before that the jeans are an entirely different fit now. Not loose like it use to be. I won't be buying them anymore. I have several pairs of 569s. These are the ones that met the description given of the fit and they are quite comfortable.I hope the folks at Levis/Dockers read this.
1,I should have listened,"Other reviews are spot-on, I should have listened. These are NOT the 569's I love wearing, these are some bastardized wannabe skinny jeans. You'd think ""loose fit"" jeans might be a little... you know, loose. Comparing to the 32x30 pair I've had for a little while, the waist is the same, the inseam is the same, but they've taken material out of the thigh and butt area. It's like they are trying to make these some Express for men designer jeans or something.Returned. No more buying jeans without trying on first."
2,Levi's are not the same!,"I have been wearing Levi's 569 for a long time, I decided to get some new pieces for work etc. These things fit NOTHING like the older 569s. The waist is correct, so is the inseam. But that is about it. The seat and thighs are tight! I ordered my usual size in black and they sent a stretch-cotton! WTH! Working men don't need stretch jeans. Plus the legs are slim around the knee area resembling a 517 bootcut. The material is thin, and feels nothing like the older 569s. I am very disappointed in this product. Levi's need to to stop forcing the ""skinny jeans"" look onto their customers. If we want skinny jeans we will buy 511s.VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
1,NOT the same old 569 jean!,"Hi...I have been a long time wearer of the 569. These are the only jeans I own. I am sincerely disappointed in the ""new"" 569 cut/quality. I am both disappointed that the jeans were changed, but also that there was no communication at all of the change. I believe this is an example of very poor marketing and change management. The new version of the 569 should not have been called 569, since there are significantly different (tighter fit and totally different waist). I will no longer be buying levi's, unless the 569's are returned to the old style/quality or a replacement is offered under a different number."
5,Muy Bueno Excelente Original,"Muy buen Producto 100% original, 100% recomendable!!! APROVECHA EL BUEN PRECIO!! me fue despachado, enviado y entregado en Venezuela en el tiempo estipulado, Lo recomiendo.Saludos."
3,"Love the fit,hate the fabric.",First off the fit on these jeans is great. Unfortunately the fabric they are made from is cheap. I don't see them holding up well. Levi's were once great long lasting jeans. I guess like everything else making them over seas and with cheap material is the goal.
5,Great Jeans,I ordered a pair of 569's from gustweillers i recieved an email that day saying they where out of stock. The very next day the jeans where in the mail i recieved them about three days later from UPS. Great service and a great pair of jeans.
5,Great book,"It's by Jeff Cooper. What better recommendation can I give? It's a slim book but packed with great philosophy, I've already read it several times and will do so many more times."
5,Great reference,Very worthwhile resource to have. Use & recommend to many others. Valuable information in today's concerns. Would definitely refer others to it.
2,Simplistic and Basic,"The book was much shorter than expected and very simplistic. Many pages were ""filler"" pages with simple pictures (i.e. a rhino, deer, handgun) to ""illustrate"" principles of aggressiveness, alertness, speed, ruthlessness, coolness, & surprise. His book content could have been covered in one chapter of a more educated and informed book."
3,"Short, simple and true","I downloaded this via Kindle and wasn't sure what to expect. This was a very short, simple read. Very truthful in principle, but much to be desired if you are looking for a deeper, intellectual approach as I was hoping to find."
4,This is not a book.,"This is not a book, but rather a pamphlet. I was not aware of that until after the purchase. The ideas presented in the pamphlet are correct, of course, but is it very simplified and brief. They are also the same dictates that are 6000 years old."
3,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.,A WELL RESPECTED EXPERT. HOWEVER THE BOOK (A PAMPHLET REALLY) IS JUST A COMPILATION OF VIGNETTES. OVERPRICED FOR WHAT IT IS. A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.
5,A very good and succinct little book,"In an age of authors paid by word count and of pretending that evil only happens to other people, this book is very refreshing. It is a concise instruction manual for your state of mind. And just as they told you in school, your attitude is THE single most important component of success - be it in getting a degree or saving your life and the life of your loved ones should you have the misfortune of facing evil. Perhaps you never will, but if you do, you'll be happy you had spent the time reading this book."
2,Principles of Personal Defense,"O.K. The basic concepts of the book are fine. However, this is not a book. It is a magazine article in disguise. Half of the forty pages are pictures, blank, of half pages of text. Go to the library if you must read this, but save your money."
4,Extremely Good for Novice,"If you're new to personal defense, you need to read... no you need to devour this text.I assure you that once you ever face situations that Jeff Cooper describes, you will be equipped to handle them. This book literally could save your life.Do not be a victim even when you're the victim!If this book were longer, it would be even better but listen... if it were longer, fewer people would read it. It would sit on shelves for ""one of these days"" and then it might be too late.I do not know Jeff Cooper but I have read one other book of his and I am so very greatly impressed. He teaches so much more than defense in his writings, although for this jewel, it's primary reason for being is to teach you to protect yourself."
5,valuable book,"Two guys tried to assault me, as I was walking home one night. I was able to escape, unharmed, because I was applying principles I'd recently learned from this book.Thanks be to God who delivered me, and the means deliverance, which was Mr Cooper's book!"
2,"Valid information, but short","This ""book"" is really an essay that has had its presentation manipulated to make bulky enough to bind. I found the information valid, but definitely not worth the $10 I paid for it. The margins on each page are wider than the Mississippi; couple that with several full-age pencil sketches based on the theme of a topic and a copious amount of blank pages interspersed and you get the ""not enough information to make a book but I want to sell it that way anyway."""
5,great book,This is a great book. It is pretty short so i feel like i had more to read but it's very good.
3,so so,worth while only if you know little bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla these idiots require lots of unnecessary words
2,Principles of Personal Defense,"Was interesting and somewhat informative, but this was originally written as a lecture, certainly not a book. It is very brief and I don't believe that it is worth the price."
4,Great basic guide to the principles of street survival.,"Yes, I have read all the other reviews and though some of their criticisms are justified, this is still a very good basic guide for anyone interested in street survival. It is only 42 pages long but the seven principles are as valid today as they were in 1972 when this booklet was published by Paladin Press. Each of the seven principles (Alertness, Decisivness, Aggressiveness, Speed, Coolness, Ruthlessness, Surprise) is explained in detail by the author, who is a legend in combat shooting and street survival.In conclusion, this is a text that is for anyone who desires to learn what it takes to survive a violent confrontation.Rating: 4 Stars. Joseph H. Truncale(Author: Martial Art Myths-Cafe Press)."
4,Required reading for those interested in self-defense,"Cooper's book is the starting point for anybody interested in protecting himself or herself from violent attack. While Cooper is best known as a founder of The Modern Technique of the Pistol, this is not a book about guns or gunfights. It is about the mental conditioning, notably including situational awareness, which one needs to avoid (if possible) or survive an unavoidable violent encounter.As has been said by Cooper and others, having a gun no more means you are armed than owning a piano makes you a musician. This book is a solid foundation for arming yourself against a violent criminal attack, whether or not you choose to protect yourself with a firearm."
1,Even calling this a pamphlet is being generous...,You're going to pay about a dollar a page for what you get. This is a dinner speech to your local pistol club. Calling it a book is like calling a puddle the ocean.
3,"I know it's Jeff Cooper, but","I know it's Jeff Cooper, but it's really more of a pamphlet than a book. Each item is only about a page long, with a cheesy picture proceeded by a title page and a blank page. The writing is only about 6 pages total, and good ideas, but not really a book."
2,book full of common sense,"Book is just common sense , no real tactics or tips . Not worth the money in my opinion . I am a fan of Jeff Cooper and had never read this book .Well no big revelations inside this book"
1,"Great advice but ""book"" is an overstatement.","I'm repeating what other reviewers said but the listing claims that there are 56 pages. Not including the table of contents, copyright info page, blank pages and art it's 28 pages.I should have checked the reviews but my previous experience with Jeff Cooper's excellent work blinded me to Paladin Press' shenanigans."
2,"Not a book, more of a pamphlet","Cooper writes some good stuff, and the info in this ""book"" is good, but the law of diminishing returns sure is in effect here, $10.50 for what amounts to a magazine article. Not worth the money, especially if you've already read some of his others. Take a pass, read it at the library, or buy one and share it with a group."
2,Wouldn't spend the money again....,"I admire and respect Col. Cooper, but this is way over priced for what you get. This is his basic philosophy that is echoed in a lot of his other publications."
2,Very simplistic,"I know a lot of people gush about this book, as if it reveals some grand mysteries about self-defense. I've even heard of people re-reading this book many times.My feeling is that it is overly simplistic, and all of the information is pretty obvious to anyone with even a bit of common sense. The 'Principles' covered include alertness, decisiveness, aggressiveness, speed, etc. Ask yourself this, do you really need 80 pages to cover these obvious principles?These topics are so basic that they are usually covered in every other self-defense book anyway."
3,Good Primer - But is too Short,"Jeff Cooper is an icon in the self-protection handgun defense world. He has written in many magazines and that is how this book reads. It is the length of a magazine article and the information is for the novice. This is not a critizism, but a statement of fact.Cooper's book is expesive for such little information, howeever, the information is ""dead on"" and highly important. The small chapters are informative about the ""real world of self defense.""a nice book for the beginner."
5,A great little book,"This book is absolutely wonderful, and the words in it ring with truth. It is so full of useful, thought-provoking, insight. Some things are so deep and true that it takes me some time to contemplate them fully to understand them. It is very rich reading, indeed."
3,not worth the effort,"I purchased this CD with some hopes of hearing some exotica, and instead found a product best suited to television ad background music or superficial cultural documentaries. Although Matsui's play on the shakuhachi flute is appealing and David Lindley supplies a few licks here and there that capture interest, very little else does. This is an ""international"" brand of instrumental New Age fare that attempts to sound vaguely Eastern while never straying too far from Western sensibilities, or ever taking any kind of artistic chances (although I have to admit that the final piece on the set, 'Bakemono Shuffle', is unusual--if you can get past instantly disliking it...). But for the fact that there is obviously a lot of professionalism invested, I might give it a ""2."" In short, pretty lightweight stuff that one might argue was really not worth the effort making."
2,A Disappointment,Very very bland. I expected much more of this collaboration with David Lindley. The music is unimaginative....Just luke warm.
4,best path to upgrade to HD and keep current TV,"got this DVD recorder yesterday, after simple setup, it auto-tuned 15 digital channels, and all work while other Sony HDTV can't receive some digital channels, or unstable (in and out), I never tried recording capability yetproexcellent tuner receptionpretty simple setup/operationconlong startup time (up to 1 minute)very strict HD recording rule (DVD+/- R/RW won't work as stated on manual, requires DVD-RAM, though my desktop can play, this is a hassle)if you want this DVDR for HD OTA TV upgrade if you want to keep current TV, go for it, you won't go wrong"
4,More than I wanted,"I am satisfied with this DVD recorder and only wish that I had the technical skills to operate it to its fullest. My limited understanding of the differences of formats shouldn't reflect upon the device.I do wish it would load more quickly, but the quality of recording is excellent. I don't have HD so I cannot comment on that aspect. But, all in all the unit is exactly as described and I am happy to be able to record from right off the air and the set up for timed recording is simple enough even for me."
1,Stopped working very early on...,"Got off to a good start with this unit, mainly got it to replace my old Panasonic DVD player that had stopped working after 5+ years, figured I might as well get a recorder. I hooked it up, and it easily tuned in all my cable TV channels, was able to get the remote to also control my TV. But then I was watching a regular, commercial DVD this morning, and midway through the show, it inexplicably froze.I ejected the disc, power-cycled, and even unplugged it, and I even tried the ""freeze"" reset suggested in the manual. After all these resets, it would still not play ANY disc I put in it. I get a ""No Read"" error. I never even got a chance to try out all the recording features. And this happened on the first day. Seems to me like it has a lot of nice features, but is way too delicate and easy to break. I guess you get what you pay for, cheaply-made electronics that are neither durable nor reliable. I'm returning this and replacing with something else."
2,Broken again,"My Panasonic DMR-EZ17 dvd recorder has broken down for the third time in 18 months. It was repaired twice under warranty, this time it will cost $139 plus shipping.When it worked, it worked well, but it's headed for the trash this time. The dvd recorders don't last very long, especially compared to the old VCR's. Does anyone make a VCR with an ATSC hdtv tuner yet?"
1,It was great when it worked,"I was incredibly disappointed the day this DVD recorder died on me less that two years after purchase. It was great when it worked -- massively feature-rich at an attractive price. I won't talk anymore about the great things this did, because the most important feature of any product is that the product works...and it no longer works.The DVD drive now makes a sad sound like it's trying to read a couple times then I get the infamous ""NO READ"" error. This does not appear to be an uncommon problem, but hey, you might get lucky and get a good one! Before you buy do a Google search for "" DMR-EZ17 +""no read "". Panasonic's solution for out of warranty problems: Send it in and for $130 they'll fix it -- give me a break!My opinion -- don't waste your money."
2,Historical Romance,"Garlock takes us to a nineteenth century Wyoming Territory town where people, particularly women were encouraged to settle. The main female character, Jane Love, was one of the people who climbed onto a train headed for the ""promise land"" where jobs and a new start were guaranteed.The historical descriptions of the land and the events were interesting and very well written, but I found the characters a bit plastic. Overall the book was an entertaining read."
5,Sweet,It was simple yet illuminative writing which led me to nearly read this book in one sitting. I thoroughly enjoyed the story. It was a sweet romance. Don't go here if you are searching for sensuality.
1,Whole season 1 for couple dollars more,"This looks like a repackage of only 4 episodes from Season 1, which is available at Amazon right now as a complete set of 13 episodes plus extras for a couple dollars more. BUY THE WHOLE SET so we can see a release of Seasons 2 and 3.This is an extremely entertaining show imported from Canada. Well written, acted with great enthusiasm by the cast of, I assume, native Canadians. Refreshingly fun family entertainment!"
1,A complete waste of money. Buy the season 1 DVD instead.,"I just wanted to second Denwar's review. Entirely. This is about a third of season one (for at least half the price, only two dollars less right now) with the only extra being a poster and an interactive DVD game. Seriously? We all know what this really is: a lame attempt at getting more money out of us for the same stuff we've already bought (or will buy), and a way to further stall the release of the season DVD. But we're on to you. And if this doesn't sell well, like Denwar said, they will probably put out the season 2 DVD faster. Besides, why waste your money?"
2,A little disappointed,"I am a huge fan of Chopin. Honestly, I would have enjoyed this a lot better if there was not a distracting static or scratching noise in the background. I found myself paying more attention to that than the music. But I gave it two stars because the music is lovely. I guess, I should have read the reviews before selecting it."
1,disappointed,"This Chopin Album is nice music but the heavy breathing on it ruins it for me, making it impossible to listen to."
3,Serious sound issues,"Most other reviewers here are, thankfully, much better qualified to review Mr Arrau's talents and interpretative strategies than I. However, what no one has mentioned up here (to my knowledge anyway) is the abysmal static issue on both discs. Almost every ten seconds a static wave obtrudes itself onto the sound--you can anticipate it and you will cringe every time you hear it (at least I did). It makes Chopin's beautiful numbers unbearable at parts, for Chopin relies so much on a pure and clear atmosphere of pensive motion--and this cannot be maintained on discs encumbered with such noxious static. Stand warned."
3,"Not for sensitive ears, but good Chopin regardless.","The interpretations that Claudio Arrau has put forth for Chopin do not lack any of that beauty that one comes to expect from the romantic composer. However, my hearing is very apt and even when I listen to these recordings on a lower volume than I normally admit for most pieces, I can distinctly hear obnoxious gasps for breath from the pianist on the majority of tracks. It is very sad that the recording studio couldn't remove this extremely distracting noise because it really takes you away from a genuine Chopin experience. I listened to the cd on several systems, the noise is noticeable on everyone. If you don't have very sharp ears, this album will fulfill your need to have Chopin's nocturnes and impromptus together (and the music itself is very good on the cd).Hope this will inform others who are very particular about the quality of the recording they buy."
2,Not very fine-tuned playing,"I also own the CD ""The Romantic Pianist"" by EMI, which has Nocturnes 13, 20 and 21. ""The Romantic Pianist"" sounds so much better than this one by Arrau."
2,Not to my taste,"Sorry to disagree with the majority here, but as much as I love Arrau overall--he's one of my all-time favorite pianists--I find these nocturne performances slow, laborious, waterlogged, overly thick in texture, with an awkward and self-conscious rubato. I never liked these when I first heard them years ago on lp, and I don't care for them now. Nevertheless, I've heard Arrau play the Chopin etudes well, and he is indeed superb in Beethoven, Liszt and Schumann... I consider him the greatest Schumann player in the world but, ironically, he is now known more for this version of his stodgy Chopin nocturnes than his brilliant Schumann. I would take Moravec's or Vasary's performances over these any day and wish that Arrau had gotten his fingering moving more on these sluggishly performed nocturnes; it sounds like he ate a heavy German meal before he sat down at the piano rather than Crpe Suzette."
5,"Solid, durable protector","We use this surge protector to protect our laptop and video projector for portable presentations. It is constantly being plugged and unplugged, packed and unpacked. We have used it with two laptops, a video projector, an overhead projector, and a portable sound system all at once, things being switched on and off. Over the past two years or so, we've never had any power blips, loose connections, or broken pieces. It has been rock solid. It's a bit big for travel, but the size and number of outlets means we're never without connection."
4,About Vayage...,"Voyage to the City of the Dead is the tale of 2 scientist on a world with 3 sentient species. They encounter personally all three species and the reader meets and learns about each's culture. In the end there is a further clue to ADF's side story of the evil blackness and the race that knew about it. A very good book, but not neccassarily one of his best. I recommend it."
4,moving and mysterious until the very end,"As much as I generally choose fast paced, psychological suspense mysteries - this book kept me on the edge of my seat. Just as Cook was about to reveal a thread of the story he would pull you back into the present - it had twists and turns and was well written. Cook did a great job of keeping me guessing until the very end. It is a haunting story of lost love and remorse. It truly brings you back to those days of yearning in high school and shows you how one small event effets so many lives. A great read and a moving tale."
4,Surreal story of lost love,"This is the first Thomas H Cook book that I have read. His style of prose truly lends itself to a daydreaming stream of consciousness. He lets you drift backwards in the main character's memory, and pulls you back to the present, all the time staying mostly in chronological order. Only once or twice does he ask you to piece together a bridge for the occurences being described.This is a very short read, not only in actual legnth, but also because the way the story flows.This book is also excellent when it comes to describing teenage angst and yearning. He uses words in a very beautiful and tearing collage to portray love.There is a very strong element of mystery in this book, and it pulled me in, but the edge of human emotions made me keep reading until I was done, only hours after starting this book.Read it."
5,Read this book!,"This is one of my all-time favorite books, one that I will never forget. It is simply a beautiful novel, filled with gems both in prose and plot that I have rarely seen before or since. I disagree with those that disliked or misinterpreted the ending. I found it shocking, moving and disturbing, yet satisfying. Take your time reading this book. It will be rewarding. I promise."
5,Amazing Book! A MUST read!!!,"This is my first Thomas Cook novel, and I was floored! This was a fabulous story with twists and turns and you never know quite what's going to happen...then the end! Oh my goodness, I was astounded by the twist. I have since gone out and purchased two more of Thomas Cook's books, and I'm going to get started immediately. You must get this book and read it. You won't be able to put it down."
4,Who did it,"Hi to the person who wants to know ""who did it."" And, if someone is reading this and hasn't read this book, and plans to, don't read this message. I read this book a couple of weeks ago, and have read a couple since, but I seem to remember it was Kelly's boyfriend who ""did it."" He couldn't handle the gossip about her supposedly being a bi-racial woman, and in their teenage quarrel, he accidently caused her to fall. I thought the book was fairly good, however The Chatham School Affair and Mortal Memory were, to me, much better."
2,not certain it had any effect,"I did take one bottle supply of these over a period of perhaps one-1.5 months. I must admit, it might not have been a long enough period to notice but I really did not see any particular difference to skin tone or quality."
5,Joint pain relief,"(I never even noticed it was also a beauty aid.) I mistakenly bought a Glucosamine Triple Joint bottle with the 10 mg. H-acid instead of MSM. Within 2 weeks I noticed my thumb joints no longer hurt. What?!? When that combo joint supplement was no longer available, I noticed the pain came back. Got this H-acid and viola! pain was gone again. My doctor ""poo-poo"" the idea that an oral application was effective, but I don't care. Even if it is only in my head, I'm a fan of this ""placebo"". I now take 1/2 pills and find it is the best thing to help relieve my shoulder and knee pain. Nothing can completely eliminate my pain, but it sure makes life much more liveable. I say give it a try - Hope it works for you."
4,"Dvorak, Brahms: Violin Concertos / Busch, Barzin, Munch","Adolf Busch... he is the one of great typical German violinist. He makes so many famous recordings under the name of his own quartet.Brandenburg Concerto, Beethoven String Quartet, Brahms Clarinet Quintet...That's why we do not know him well as a 'Soloist'.His tempo is quite slow comparing to contemporary soloists. But, the flow of his music is of nature, itself. Glorious!Also, the conductor - Hans Munch- is keeping his own tempo for this soloist.The Brahms concerto is of great performance as others like Oistrakh or De Vito. Only the version of Heifetz's is overwhelming.But, the Dvorak concerto is slightly disappointed.The great female violinist - Johanna Martzy - made her greatest recording for this concerto.Please remind that the beginners or the late listeners who already be accustomed to digital sound shall not select this item. Noise level is more serious than expected."
4,If you liked the movie you will love the CD,The CD has both superior sound and great quality. The music was chosen very carefully and seems to be very European in style. I would recommend this CD to anyone who really enjoyed the movie.
2,Not too reliable.,"Double winder had one unit fail after a short while.Requested replacement that never arrived.Another on the way.Unit lets watches slowly get behind in keeping proper time.Instructions not informative enough.Unit looks great but feels cheap,no wonder considering price to be fair.Keeps watches ""alive""but not accurate.Best spend more on another unit but it will barely do.You must experiment with the four different time settings to see which one keeps your watches most accurate and ticking but you'll get no help from the instructions as mentioned before.They will however over-explain the settings and their time intervals."
4,multi setting smart ic timer,"The product, as i recalled, cost about $36 for a double winder. The product works quite well and is reasonably quiet. If one reads one of the watch magazines on the market one will quickly find out there are many watch winders out there and most cost a lot of money--in the hundreds to thousands of dollars. This product is in the tens of dollars and works very well. I am very happy with the product--as well as Amazon (dot) com."
5,quiet...quiet.....quiet,owned a different brand that was noisy and only worked for about a month......this winder i can not hear it run and have had it a couple of months....it is still running like clock work......would recommend to anyone that doesnt want to pay an arm and leg for one......
4,Automatic watch winder,"You need an automatic watch winder if you have more than one automatic watch. This product is very adequate and relatively inexpensive. I use it 24/7. It keeps my watches wound so I don't have to reset every time I chose to switch the watch I am wearing. You could pay more money and get better quality wood and interior fabric. However this product is attractive, functional and practical. It meets my needs and I am happy with the purchase."
1,Garinin Double Watch Winder,"I have owned two of the Garinin double watch winders.The first lasted a week and had to be replaced. The second lasted less than two months. Rather than return it, I threw it out and decided to find a better product. AT $50, a good buy, but the two that I received did not work, even though I was careful follow all of the manufacturer's instructions."
2,Mediocre,"I bought this winder because it was affordable (but nowhere near cheap at several hundred dollars). It arrived today and the wood finish is immaculate. This thing looks like a nice piece of furniture - on the outside. The construction is a little shoddy though. The left door isn't hung straight and the drawer won't open because the cheap fabric lining binds the drawer. The rotations are pre-set but one of the four winders moves at half the speed of the other three. Lastly, the winders themselves pop out of the back of the box because they are just stuck in with friction.Overall, it looks nice but the construction is definitely not top notch."
1,"Asian Made Junk, AA Store Customer Service a ZERO!","First, even at maximum speed, watches would not stay wound. That was while it was working OK. Then, the two winders on the felt side started spinning notably slower than the two on the right, even though they were set at the same speed. The top left winder then started making a very noticeable noise. All this within the first month. This product appears to be made in China. Regardless, it is pure junk. Tried calling the customer service number, all you get is a recorder, nobody ever calls back. If you need a winder, look for something different and don't make the same mistake!!"
4,Getting what U pay 4,"I was not expecting much for a $50 winder. But it is suprisingly quite. Yes, its plastic and feels a little ""cheap"" But.... it's fifty bucks!"
1,"Worked OK at first, then quit","I bought this appliance based on looks, assuming that all toasters were about the same. Initially, it toasted unevenly, then after several months it would not turn on unless I unplugged it for a while. Finally, it quit working all together. Steer clear of this over-priced toaster."
1,piece of junk,worked ok for a few months then slowly fell apart. lights stopped lighting. wont turn on for 2 days then starts working again. Now have to hold the bar down to toast. Its going in the trash!
3,tuner,this product is helpful by using the display to fine tune your guitar but the actual sound tones emitted to get you to match your strings to the sound tone was very annoying and almost impossible to match. for the meter alone it was worth the purchase price.
5,great tuner,"I bought one of these several months ago and love it. As a novice, you couldn't hope for anything that is easier to use. It actually makes it easier for me to tune my guitar when I don't use the tuner. Because now I know what each string is suppose to sound like. I should have bought one of these tuners years ago. I gave my tuner to some nuns who had not heard of a guitar tuner and then replace it with another."
4,good guitar tuner for the money,"Back in the 70s, Korg had a great chromatic tuner (would tune anything for several octaves - like a piano) that cost about $30. Alas, that was too good to continue and the electronic tuner market began to be divided up between instrument ranges.For guitar or bass guitar, this one is very good and costs little enough. To put it simply: this thing works well right out of the box. The best part is that it shuts off when you forget to do so. That will pay for itself in batteries pretty quickly.I bought this for a beginner and he loves it."
4,Perfect,"This thing is excellent for the price. You get a few good functional tools all in one package. The sensitivity could be better, but overall perfect for the price."
2,NOT SO GOOD DEAL,"it works good and it even has a sound mode where it is audible. Has a bass and guitar setting....you can also drop the tuning a half note to tune down or up easily, and for the money I paid $12.00 I think...anyway get itNew REVIEW...Mine broke...barely used it...don't buy it unless you want a cheapo tuner...been using the one in my new digitech pedal...it works fine...this one broke, I changed batteries and got it to turn on hear and there but it keeps going out...irritating...downgraded from 5 stars to 2 just because it worked for about 8 mnths"
4,Solid ...but lacks,"Korg does make the best tuner of this type, but this model lacks an ouput jack, so you cannot use it inline while playing through an amp. You could leave it on and use the mic to tune from. This model take AAA batteries and comes with them buried in the bottom of the box. It also has an AUTO OFF, so if you forget to shut it off after a period of time with no signal it turns off, thus saving your batteries. This model has been discontinued and Amazon had it at the lowest price."
4,Great tuner for the budding guitarist!,"Korg has done an excellent job of making tuning your guitar easy. If you are so far out of tune that you cannot find your way, just press the sound button and tune to the tone. You can then turn off the sound and accurately tune with the LCD meter or LED indicators, either with the built-in mic or by plugging your electric guitar or acoustic mic directly into the tuner. A dim LCD backlight would have been nice, but the LED's on the unit can be used in darker lit areas to get you on key quickly by visually telling you when you are sharp, flat or in tune. You can't beat it for the buck."
4,Works well,"Works great - for my son who is a beginner guitarist though, it's difficult because if the string starts out too far out of tune, the tuner won't pick up the tone at all and it's hard to find the right spot. Have to pre-tune a little against another instrument to get it into the general vicinity, then the tuner helps from there."
4,Completely satisfactory for the price.,The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is due to the inability for this tuner to stand up vertically on it's own...Would be nice if it could be stood up on a table vs. needing to be held or positioned somehow while tuning the guitar.
3,Guitar Tuner,"Inexpensive and cheaply made but fairly accurate. The LCD display can be difficult to see in dim light, and there is no backlight feature. I have only used the mic for my acoustic guitar. It is a good value for the money."
2,I got what I paid for.,"This device doesn't work well with a 4-string bass plugged into it, as the ""G"" setting doesn't recognize the open G string from my bass. It doesn't recognize the harmonic, either."
5,Good tuner.,"Easy to use. Just make sure to keep fresh batteries in it. When the batteries get low, it acts wacky."
2,Works Great Until It Doesnt Work,"Over the past 10 years, I have had 3 of thes they keep dying. Out of the blue they stop working for no reason. When they do work they are the best tuner Ive ever used. However my latest which never left my living room worked fine two days later wouldnt turn on even with brand new batteries. I get 2-3 years out of them and then kaput. Going to try something different this time around."
4,GA30 Guitar/Bass Tuner,"My son, who this was purchased for, has just started taking guitar lessons. He states that the tuner works very well. Four stars."
4,OK - a little tricky at times.,"This seems to work well but sometimes, it doesn't seem to read right. I am a beginner - so take this with a grain of salt."
3,More info please,This tuner could use more instructions. It just doesn't seem to work well and following the directions included does not work.
1,KORG-30 Is replaced by KORG-1,"The Korg-30 has been discontinued and is being replaced with Korg-1, you only finds this out when you receive your Shipment. At the time I bought mine it was selling for 18.18, amazon was selling the korg-1 for a little over 8 dollars and eligible for free shipping. It's been raised since. The seller did refund me, but just 7 dollars. It looks like another seller is using the same advertisment,and reviews for this item. This is just a warning to verify that you get the best price on the item."
2,"Ehhhhhhh, don't last","This was the first tuner I bought when I started playing about 7 years ago. It worked great at first, but then after a short while it became extremely unreliable. The needle would act like it was possessed and switch inbetween notes, say I'm tuning e string to e...I would be at e flat and it'd jump to g something. Completely rediculous.GOOD WHILE IT LASTS, get a pedal tuner. Heavy duty, great to use during gigs"
5,The best so far,"At least the best that I've tried. I am not a professional player or anything, I've been trying to learn to play the guitar for years it seems but never have, so here I am trying again. This is my third tuner, and as I said before is the best, is the most accurate of them all and very easy to use.If you are looking for a very accurate and very much affordable guitar tuner you can not possibly go wrong with this one"
4,Pretty decent.,"It's a good tuner, does what it needs to. Make sure to 'shush' people around you who try to talk while you're tuning it. It might not be the fastest product for tuning, but it is pretty dead-on accurate if you have a little patience. It also allows you to tune with emitting a sound, or just by reading the meter."
5,"Simple, fast and accurate",My husband loved it - the bass tuner was so simple to use with our accoustic guitar. Defintely recommend.
1,Wrong item,The picture you see is not the item I received!! The item I received was black and it did NOT work well at all!
5,Great for acoustic & Electric,"I've always tuned by ear, but a friend turned me onto this little tuner. I've been playing for 30 years, and hate most tuners with the spinners, and all that crap.Well, I tuned my Acoustic in about 2 minutes, plugged it into my electric, and was done with it. I'm now spoiled. You cannot find another tuner as good for the price. Ridiculously simple to use, and very dependable. Love this thing."
5,Great little gizmo,"I am a new guitar player and this device came is essential for those just learning to tune. It turns the process into an easy no-brainer. It functions well either by plugging the guitar directly into it, using it's built in microphone to read the sound or using it's tone generator as a reference to tune to. It has settings for guitar or bass but I've never used the bass setting."
5,The gold standard,This is one of the beast guitar tuners out there. And you can't bet this online price. You'll spend 30 bucks on this if you go to a music store. Great product for a great price
5,Student gets more pactice time,"There is no reason a music student should do without a tuner at home anymore. This guitar tuner doubles the amount of practice my granddaughter gets. No more excuses, and its is more enjoyable for her too. End broken strings before the ear trains, get a tuner."
5,Great Cheat Sheet and Reference Guide,"Many books say they will make your life easier in getting to know your device, this one actually does. I learned great shortcut/time saving tips for my 7105t without having to search through a mound of text. Clear, concise text makes it a great tool. Thanks a bunch."
3,OMG too much detail,"Mary Todd is an interesting lady and if you really want in-depth on her history, this is the book for you. As for me, too much info about her. I lost interest in all the details."
4,Mary Todd Lincoln,I thought it was well written and interesting. I knew very little about Mary Lincoln. After reading this book I knew a lotmore.
5,"Mary Todd Lincoln, bio......incredible!","Couldn't put this book down.....Jean Baker wrote a truly remarkable narrative non-fiction. I had previously read another fictional ""Mary"" book and was surprised to see that both books were similar in historical data surrounding her (Mary's) life. One can only imagine losing so many children and then one's husband, and NOT being driven to doing odd things. The psyche is a strange science marked by extraordinary and mysterious sensivities to outside pressures."
4,Excellent!,"Fine picture of an often-maligned woman. A few historial inaccuracies, but well written and enlightening. Follows the same path as the much newer book by Kay duPont, ""Loving Mr. Lincoln: The Personal Diaries of Mary Todd Lincoln,"" which, in fact, Jean Baker endorsed."
3,I was already familiar with her life,I love biographies but previously I read another book called Mary and it was historical fiction. I adored it. It read like a novel but told the same story. Although this was a well written biography it seemed like a text book after reading the first book.
2,Mary Todd Lincoln,"Author went into to much unneccesary detail for my taste. Jumped around to often, made it very hard to follow. I would not recommend"
5,We knew Abe Lincoln as Honest Abe - interesting learn about how Mary Todd Lincoln used the political system to her advantage,"Learned much about history and the woman who saw and drove the potential of Abe Lincoln. Mary Todd Lincoln was all about image, entitlement and herself. Good read -- interesting woman and provides a good understanding of why she was such a disliked First Lady. She did much to bring the White House to what it should be for the office and our country. A woman before her times when it came to her educational level and interest and understanding of politics."
3,A bit too much information,"This was certainly a well-researched biography, but so much minutiae about Mary Lincoln's early life made the book a very slow read. The same knowledge of her could have been conveyed in about half the amount of pages."
4,MARY LINCOLN,I enjoyed Jean Bakers detailed history surrounding Mary Todd Lincoln's life growing up. After reading about the Todd family history you can understand Mary Todd Lincoln a lot better
4,interesting treatment of a tragic life,"alot of detail, some of which is illustrative of very tragic circumstances in mary lincoln's life. how many of us could undergo so much loss unscatched?"
4,Detailed and good from a historical standpoint...,"But I came away not liking Mary Todd Lincoln much at all...she comes off as a very neurotic woman, who, once she gets to the White House, goes on a crazy spending spree, piling up unbelievable bills to decorate and for her clothing, making sure that the government pays for it all. She also accepts all kinds of gifts in exchange for job postings. She is a snob who dislikes most women and feels very far above most other people.The only criticism I have of the book is that the author draws conclusions at times that are not really backed up. She states that the Lincolns have a warm, continuing sex life, which can't be more than a guess, in my opinion. She applies the best possible spin as to what Mary meant in certain letters she wrote, to make her sound less bitchy, shallow or crazy. I think she was all three."
3,Nice old game,Old memories come to life. Older graphics unlike all the new games the younger crowd wants. Might make you feel young again.
1,Master of fragness,"Quake 3 Arena cambia totalmente el concepto de la saga Quake de id software, aunke algunos digan ke fue para mal, Q3A provee a sus jugadores accion frenetica, deskiziada y llena de sangre. Con su rapida modalidad de juego este juego promete horas y horas de diversion, sobre todo en LANPartys"
5,the kids love them,"they are like the picture, pretty cute, small, the kids take them everywhere, even go to sleep with them, dace and wach the show. it is a pretty good gife for that price."
3,Cute in itself,My granddaughter just loved them for a few minutes and then got bored. There's not much one can do with a stuffed animal. But they are cute and look just like the one characters on TV.
1,This is not a technical book,"I bought the book searching for technical material that would help me understand the ATM/ADSL protocols.What I found was an extremely superficial book that explains the very basics of telecommunications, digital transmission and the OSI layers. With 1 very short and practically irrelevant chapter reserved to ATM itself and another to ADSL, I wouldn't recommend anyone this book.If you're the extreme beginner, search for a primer on networking or telecommunications. If you're not, get another book on ATM."
3,broken tape,"The set of tapes took over a month to arrive and when I tried to play the first tape, it wouldn't work.The tape was totally broken.The rest of the set worked and I love Ram Dass so I loved the actual context of the tapes. But I was disappointed that I could not listen to the first tape."
3,duller than I thought it would be,"Certainly, the title character must have led an interesting life. But I found this book less interesting than I had hoped, just a listing of one event after another. However, I did get some sense of how difficult the lives of Jews were in Southern Europe; even Iberian Jews who converted to Christianity were never safe from Christians who were happy to accuse them of backsliding in order to have an excuse to confiscate their property.The only way to avoid this problem was to move (as Dona Gracia did) to Muslim lands, because the Ottoman Empire was much less anti-Semitic than most Christian governments. In fact, the Ottoman Empire actually protected Jews in Christian Europe by insisting on decent treatment of Jews with ties to the Empire. One lesson of this book is that Jews never have permanent allies or permanent enemies, only permanent interests."
1,Yep. Stale.,"Like several other reviewers have said, the bags I opened were stale. Despite the ""best by"" date being months in the future, the puffed wheat had the consistency of slightly damp styrofoam. And returns are not permitted, even the unopened bags. If you feel lucky, go ahead and roll the dice on this purchase...I did and lost."
1,second rate product,this stuff looked like what fell through the screen when quaker oats was done making their product. I wouldn't buy this again.
3,Not Organic :(,"I really like this cereal. I have it almost every day for breakfast. It's unsweetened and doesn't seem to have that off taste that a lot of other puffed cereals have. HOWEVER, I wish Arrowhead Mills would make the jump and make their puffed cereals organic. It seems like every other product made by the Hain Celestial group is organic, except these puffed cereals! I like this cereal, but I would love it if I knew I wasn't getting any harmful ingredients or GMOs."
2,McBain's Out Of Ideas On This One,"Have you ever seen the Jumping the Shark website? It's dedicated to TV shows that have gone downhill, and the site invited viewers to pinpoint the exact moment that a show ""Jumped The Shark""...the phrase comes from an episode of 'Happy Days'. Well, Ed's ""Jumped The Shark"" with this one. Any police/crime novel where the author has to rely on an ultra-clever, supernaturally mysterious archnemesis with no name (a la James Bond), well, you know he's out of good plot ideas. And, unfortunately, ol' Ed's spent too much time in this book detailing the sexual exploits of various characters, with said detail contributing little if anything to the story.Do yourself a favor - stick with Ed's earlier stuff - it's a treat. ""Eight Black Horses"" is a throwaway."
2,"Not A Lot Worth Celebrating, Apparently","I own hundreds of science fiction and fantasy books, yet only two (Timothy Zahn's Blackcollar books) are published by Daw. Now I know that's probably not a coincidence. This collection is supposed to be a celebration of Daw's 30th anniversary, yet none of the stories are standouts and several, including Zahn's and Frederik Pohl's, seem to have ""phoned in."" Even C.J. Cherryh's contribution disappoints. Of course, there is no such thing as a perfect anthology, but if you want some provocative sci-fi pick up Universe 1 edited by Robert Silverberg instead of this one."
3,So So,"This definitely wasn't as good as the collection of fantasy book that they put out. Some of these stories were so boring I thought I'd fall asleep. I would recommend the fantasy collection, not the science fiction."
5,The Healing We Took Birth For,"I have loved Steven Levine's work since attending hiis workshop on ""Conscious Living, Conscious Dying"" over 30 years ago. His book, ""Healing into Life and Death"" has become even more valuable as a recent medical situation has re-ignited the need to deal with unspoken grief....And although his meditations are in that book, the CD's (in the context of a workshop) offer a much more effective way to benefit from the rich blessings these tapes have to offer. I highly recommend them ....don't wait for a life crisis!"
5,Grief Process,Bought for a friend but has helped me understand a different aspect of looking at grief. It provides an interesting perspective that allows healing.
5,Claudio Arrau shines,"Only a few pianists have recorded the études d'exécution trnscendante. Among them, the chilean pianist Claudio Arrau is the greatest. He combines virtuosism with poetry, profundity with clearness. All extra words are in vain. Just listen to this recording."
5,My Best Liszt Etudes,"My best Liszt Etudes so far. I have bought two of them, one as a gift to a friend. And years later, I have bought Arrau's Heritage album which consists also of these etudes.Some people may find Arrau's Beethoven or even his Brahms authentic, others may find some of his Beethoven sonatas boring, however inspired they may be. But with his Liszt, there is no way that one will ever get bored: under Arrau's fingers, the etudes sound more like symphonies and tonal poems. They may not be stunning, but they are sublime and so thrilling that they actually reminds you, in different ways, of almost all Liszt's ups and downs.I never like Bolet, let alone Kissin. For fascination, people may like to try Cziffra as well. But it is nothing like Arrau's Liszt at all. It is not clear if the inclusion of Magaloff is a coincidence. But he is well worth of our time, and we don't have a lot of his recordings anyway. Viewers might as well treat it as a bonus."
1,Sound quality may be below expectations,Terrible sound quality - very disappointed. I requested money back from the vendor. The CD suffered from incessant electronic 'clicking' or static sounds throughout. Unbearable to listen to with any pleasure.This could be a problem with Phillips as I had the same problem with Claudio's CD of 3 Beethoven sonatas by Phillips.Sound is muffled as well. Not well done. I like Claudio and was hoping to enjoy this but the noise/static/clicking is unbearable.
3,i know the better one!,"Before you wanna buy this CD, please check the CD of Kissin. I forgot the title, but he recorded some of those etudes and Schumann's fantasy in one CD. Kissin's CD is better than this CD in sound quality and detaled tone color plus dynamic FF!"
5,LOVE 'EM!,"I bought these boots after searching for quite a long time. I came across them unexpectedly on Amazon and liked the style and bought them, crossing my fingers that they would be as adorable and COMFORTABLE as they looked online. AND THEY ARE! These boots are unbelievably comfortable -- I live in New York City where I'm walking constantly, and my feet survive! Additionally, I cannot count how many times someone has stopped me to ask me where I got my boots from -- all in all, I would recommend these boots to anyone. LOVE 'EM!"
2,Buyer be warned,"While this book does provide information on how to take a Japanese bath, any buyer should be aware that the book is only about 30 pages long and half of those pages are illustrations. Where there is actual text, most of it consists of no more than one or two sentences. This book literally took me about three minutes to read.If you are interested in the art of the Japanese bath, there are many books about Japan in general that cover the topic in at least as much detail as this book, if not more."
2,A very thin book,"I found this book to be very thin physically and in content. I was hoping to find out more about this very Japanese custom. The line drawings are adequate and complement the text. If you have a friend who is interested in things Japanese it would make an inexpensive gift, but I was disappointed in it overall."
5,Hilarious,"My Lucky Star is the kind of book David Sedaris would write if he lived in Los Angeles and decided to pen a novel.This being the first novel I've read by Joe Keenan (but certainly not the last) I was unfamiliar with his characters: Philip, Gilbert, and Claire, who --sick of their failed relationships and dead-end Manhattan jobs-- move to Los Angeles, with dreams of stardom and riches. At first everything goes well. Aided by Gilbert's mogul stepfather, they manage to get their feet on the door of Hollywood, only to realize that Murphy was right: that everything that can (including things you figured could not) go wrong, indeed does.Being the victims of blackmail? Having your heart broken by a closeted movie star? Your sex acts caught on tape? Check, check, check... My Bright Star contains so many laughs I could not recommend it more. Just don't read it while eating, unless you're willing to clean up after yourself."
5,Laugh Riot,"I hadn't read the two earlier books, but have now purchased them and look forward to doing so after reading My Lucky Star. The book is simply laugh out loud funny. I found myself trying to read it fast to find out what happened next, then going back to reread certain passages because some of the one-liners were so clever and witty. Buy this book -- you won't be disappointed. And no, I'm not Joe Keenana's publicist."
5,Keenan gets better and better.,"I thought the previous two were the funniest books I'd ever read, but this one is even more hilarious. Some people have objected to the sex scene, but you'll be laughing too hard to be offended."
5,Great Book,"Joe Keenan is too funny. All three of these books have been such a fun read. VERY FUNNY! This is the third in a series. If you enjoyed watching the T.V. show Frasier, you will love the story lines. Joe was a writer on the show."
3,I was disappointed,"The first two books were great -- or so I recall from a decade ago. However, had I read this story first, I wouldn't read another of Keenan's. The toughest issue to deal with was Philip's constant drooling devotion to Stephen, who's obviously using him - reversing roles, Gilbert tries to get his friend to face reality on that. The characters seemed way overdone, even for a farce. I'd read a fourth one to see if the series gets back on track, but I'll need to be convinced."
2,Basic and Uneffective,"This 49 minutes guitar lesson isn't worth jack. Though it teaches you fingerpicking, 12 bar blues, chords and such; it isn't nearly as good as the other basic guitar instructions. You can get these simple lessons anywhere on Google. The teachers are old-fashioned, dressed in their 80s and teaching just few basic stuff about guitars. I'll be surprised if people can learn guitar from this DVD. If I were you, skip it, there are many guitar instructions DVD out there."
2,Nice try but hard to finish.,I thought that this would be an interesting read at first but the book is very hard to finish. Sometimes it felt like I was reading my son's old book reports for school. The subject matter is good but the author's skill as a writer needs a great deal of work. I didn't feel like the author was trying very hard and I wish I'd have saved my money.
1,not well written,"I thought it was a good story, and would probably be a great selling book if it had been written by an experienced author. I felt like it had been written by a grade school age child. It needed more details and a more adult vocabulary."
4,Red Label Violin Sting Set 3/4 Review,"Strings came intact and on time. String set is very sturdy and maybe not as high quality as the more expensive sets. But for me being a non-violin player, I believe they suit the purpose for a student violin for my very young children. Very simple to install by myself. I simply followed instructions I found on the Internet and the string set held up quite nicely given the fact that I have never done this before. Once on and tuned (I have an electronic tuner as well as being a trumpet player myself), I was able to tune the violin and strings without difficulty. Strings held up well during the tuning process. I recommend this item especially for starter violins/student needs. Higher quality strings may be more suitable for more seasoned students or even my children once they get more involved with violin. Great product and highly recommended."
4,Nice set of string,I bought these to replace the strings on a used viloin that we bought used. The instructor was pleased with the quality. I bought this for my 10yr old who started learning violin. She likes the sound these strings make :)
3,Hard to get past the initial part,"I've been to Steve Squyres lecture with the same title. The lecture, and Steve Squyres, were inspiring. So I bought the book. I'm still trying to get past the initial phase where Steve Squyres describes the hurdles of getting the project up and running. The book is tedious, with a lot of details that don't add to clarity, rather confuse with acronyms that hide the goal and the mission. If Steve Squyres' goal was to educate the reader as to how complex a problem it is to send a rover to Mars, more politically than technically, then he has succeeded. I was hoping to see more vision and insipration and maybe I'll get it once I get past the initital phase of getting the project off the ground."
4,Seeing other worlds,"The world of scientific grants, NASA bureaucracy, and scientist vs. engineer rivalry was the first alien vista this book opened up to me. If you are curious about how things get done in the outside-of-the-work-a-day world of NASA, this book will be fascinating. Of greater interest to me was the way that Mr. Squyres described the multiple setbacks and technical challenges of designing, building and testing the spacecraft. Given the specialzied scientific nature of the mission, I thought that Mr. Squyres used clear, layman-friendly language (albeit anaviodably rich with acronyms) to describe what the Mars rovers were looking for and what they found. This is a good book for non-scientitists who are interested in Mars and NASA."
3,An Interesting Read,I enjoyed Mr. Squyres book very much. It is an overview of the project from the beginning to the present. The photographs are excellent and worth seeing. I was hoping for more detail concerning the actual operation of Spirit and Opportunity.
4,Parker's originals are as good as her remixes,"Gorgeous, earthy late-night dance music, piano and strings all over, for when you've stopped dancing. If you like your ambient tecno and turntablism with vocals, get this (vocal) version. Her vocals ain't bad, but they're not compelling and brilliant in the way she uses samples of others' vocals in her remix work. If you're of the religion that says vocals ruin electronica, this isn't going to convert you. But you will most absolutely want the instrumental version of the LP. And if you're undecided, go with the instrumentals. As songs with vocals, it's good. But the music tracks are wonderful."
4,Tracklist Correction,"The tracklist above is incorrect. The actual list is as follows:The Unknown, Clutching At Straws, Breaking the Code, In Two Minds, Melodious Thunk, Some Other Level, Elements Of Style, Going Nowhere, Sneeze, Return Of the Rocking Chair, Exclamation Mark!"
2,not enough information on chimes,I have been watching your displays for a considerable time but i never know what the size of the chimes. it is important in some cases.For an example Wind Chines In The Rain. They are great but what is the size.
3,Sleep relaxation & snoring aid,"I started listening to relaxation CDs for sleeping, turned down to almost subliminal volume so as not to disturb my partner. What a discovery to find it stopped his obnoxious snoring! So now we both sleep better and he'll actually complain if I forget to turn it on at night. But this CD was not quite what I expected. Alot of unvarying rain, a few chimes. Not bad but not great. Doesn't help with his snoring. Preferred ""Thunder & Light Rain"" by Nature sounds. I have to swap CDs out after a week or two otherwise his snoring starts up again. On the lookout for an ocean wave CD. Other favorite that works well is ""Nada Himalaya"" by Deuter."
3,mostly rain,"Good recording though is mostly just rain. After about ten minutes the chimes are minimal. Ialready had great rainstorms,i wanted what was advertised, wind chimes."
1,Mediocre. The other review isn't even about the game!,"This game was mediocre. Aside from having an insanely bizarre error of flipping the computer screen 90 degrees (easily fixed), the units on the field look cartoonish... like those kids toys in which there's no torso, only oversized head, hands, and feet. That's exactly how the units look. The game functions are overly simplified of ""get gold, build units, kill enemy"" with absolutely no impressive fighting effects or anything even remotely impressive in appearance. Outdated graphics cannot be blamed for this--it is simply poor, visiblyHistorical accuracy aside, the game seems quite shallow of just moving from mission to mission with your troops mindlessly going around killing enemies at your control. Terrible game"
4,Havent done it but looks great!!!!,"This Troy game looks great, I hope you can fight as Archilles, Hector, Paris or Menelaus. Even maybe someone else like Helen! That'd be kinda fun. Anyways it might be those games where you see it and buy it, or pass it without a glance."
4,Original Yet Comfortable,"Tag Team Trampoline appearantly from Massochussettes or however you sell it, are somewhat difficult to describe. The best way to say it, a Trio of Guys form an Indie Band. That's it. I've heard a few comparisons to Modest Mouse, though I rarely see the similiarity. The only thing in common they have is the Indie Genre. They have the attitude of Barenaked Ladies, where you can put something funny in a serious song, because it doest detract from the enjoyment of it. I bet Tag Team Trampoline laughs at funerals. Anyway, I enjoy this CD very very much and I will continue to enjoy it for a olong time. The music is very unique and enjoyable, and easily hooks you in and keeps you interested. A Bit Emo, (not screamo), a bit punk, a bit ecclectic, and a lil bit of awesome. I enjoy them very much, and I know you will too."
2,Eh,"This book had a lot of already known information. It did have a few good tips, but overall not worth buying the whole book. Maybe it would be helpful for others."
1,GoveS98,was NOT what I had thought it was going to be. I wanted the score by Mr. Heil. NOT here. Most of the songs are NOT my cup of tea. GREAT movie though.
3,Not what is advertised,"Very disappointed, was sold as 100% cotton, to find out its 60/40. Not right. I bought these for my nephew, only to find out they were not what was advertised."
4,I like this book a lot!,"This book is ideal for those needing an injection of inspiration and fortitude. It really touched my spirit. If you like this book, I also recommend, Peace Be Still: Inner Healing for Racial Harmony."
5,Perfect fit in All Ways!!,I ordered this replacement holster for my ancient bulky blackberry and it arrived a little used but perfectly genuine and in good shape. Price was LOW and I definately got more than I paid for out of it. Excellent!
2,8703e holster,The blackberry doesn't snap into the holster. So the phone comes out of the holster easily. Bottom line... it doesn't serve the purpose for my Blackberry 8703e.
5,Great easy listening CD,"Stephen Bishop is the best kept secret in the easy listening music world. This CD is very enjoyable; his vocals are so unique as is his writing style. So glad he's back to recording as it's been a long time since his best album ""Bish"""
5,PELTOR SHOTGUNNER,"I work around running jets ALL DAY and these peltors are 10x better than the stuff I get issued. they fold up pretty compact, and do a great job at reducing noise. Only thing I could even remotely see as being a negative is the wrap for the heabands is a little cheaper than what I would like to see. I did a ""Parachord"" wrap job around it and they have held up for almost a year of flightline abuse being covered in sweat, hydraulic fluid, oil, and jet fuel. HANDS DOWN, I LOVE EM'"
4,Awesome!!!,These hearing protectors are great. When folded up they're really compact too so easy to travel with.
2,Much less quality armoire than expected,"The jewelry armoire arrived very quickly and was packaged great. It was a lighter color (and more red) than shown in advertising pictures. I was surprised how little real wood was in the armoire. The legs, drawer fronts, and lid were wood. Everything else appeared as composite wood or plywood or MDF. What dissapointed me the most were the quality of the drawer sides, bottoms, and back and the support structure of the case. They were composite type wood (or chip core) and not very pleasant to slide in/out. The drawer rough bottom edges made their use unpleasant and hard to slide. I bought this for my wife as a gift. I was disappointed enough with it to go out and buy her another one immediately at my local furniture store. I will get rid of this one."
4,cute,"Martha is a dog and one day she eats a bowl of alphabet soup and suddenly finds she can talk. Martha and her dog friend Skits go for a walk down town. They see a man advertising a Perfect Pup School. He claims that he can turn any dog in to the `perfect"" pet! Martha sees right through the scheme right and way and sets out to prove to everyone that the man is a fraud!The main characters in the book are dogs. Children seem to enjoy stories about dogs.Yes The colorful pictures are well drawn and pleasing to the eye."
1,Junk,"My daughter recieved this camera for Christmas. If use the high quality setting for taking pictures, it only holds 20. The ""high quality"" is much worse then a bad cell phone picture. My daughter will be taking pictures and all of a sudden all the pictures are gone. It was dropped once and it broke. It isn't worth any amount of money."
1,Too cheap to be useful.,"My daughter was given this as a gift. We were excited to have a simple, rugged digital camera for her to use since both her mother and I are photo-nuts. Unfortunately this camera is a little too simplistic (not to mention cheaply built) to be used.The rear of the camera has a two digit display. Yes, two digits. When presented codes like ""oF"", ""dP"" and ""OO"" we were never sure if we were going to take pictures or delete them. Pictures were extremely low quality and low resolution, as you might expect when you have a $15 digital camera. Since we've migrated to a Mac, however, the pictures are now ""no quality"". There's no Mac support so the camera now sits gathering dust.Avoid this one and buy a 2nd hand digital camera instead."
1,Brookeee needs some acting lessons,I can only hope the Ms. Shields used the money she made from this film to take some acting lessons. She REALLY needs them!!
4,Great Music,"I love this cd! Its probably one of the better buys I made concerning my wedding. Like most people, I have no idea what classical music is appropriate for a wedding, and for the wedding I hope to have. Listening to this cd has helped me make more intelligent choices and be more informed especially when I'm dealing with the church music director. I feel more confident knowing that I am familiar with the choices before me.The renditions of the music is wonderful too. I always thought the Bridal Chorus from Lohegrin too ""common"" but listening to the orchestra and choir on this cd has changed my mind--its a beautiful interpretation of the song that's sure to bring a tear or two."
3,Baroque for Brides-to-be,"Short and sweet: I am looking for wedding music to be played while guests are being seated, and I'm only having 2 songs sung by actual vocalists. Just listening to the music for reviewing is enough to bring tears to my eyes. My wedding is coming up in April 2000, so there is a lot of emotion going on inside of this bride-to-be. All in all, so far it is a beautiful album."
5,Provocative,"After about the sixth viewing of this interesting video, I've fallen in love with it. If you're a fan of Natalie Merchant at all, you should really consider buying this. Miss Merchant's originality, cleverness, and talent are all shown off here. Along with the 22 minute short film, are five music videos. 2 from Ophelia and 3 from Tigerlily. The short film is very interesting. And as I watch it, I begin to realize what I think Miss Merchant wants us to get out of it. That in every person there are many different sides, many different personalities within.. It's a beautifully done, well directed piece of work. Natalie is charming and humorous. I highly recommend this."
4,The heart and soul of Natalie Merchant,"Ophelia is probably the first record where Natalie Merchant is completely in control of everything. Her first solo album Tigerlily was good but it seemed as though Natalie was holding back. Now, on Ophelia, she completely lets loose and this video is a wonderful companion to the epic album. Natalie isn't exactly a capable actress and I hope she never gets further involved in acting, but the amount of passion and heart she put into this project makes you forget that she isn't an actress. Natalie is simply telling the story of Ophelia from another perspective and this video more than works. I have never been so fascinated with an artist like I have with Natalie. Her records don't soar to the top of the charts and she isn't on every magazine cover, but she shares with us what she does best, which is creating beautiful and inspiring music."
5,A great video that I would watch over and over,I recomend this video to the average Natalie Merchant fan. I found it very good and I think you will too.
4,A must have for Natalie fans,"This video is so wonderful. The short film really pulls the whole concept of the album together & it is a lot of fun too. As an added bonus, you also get all of her videos!!"
3,"Very quiet, but reliable??","I have had two of these in a Cooler Master Centurion Minitower for about 6 months now. For the last few months, the Scythe I have on my CPU heatsink has failed to start on bootup. It starts to spin, but ends up simply stopping. A quick spin with the finger gets it going, but who wants to open their case every time they turn their computer on? This fan has an extremely high startup voltage (8.9v!), which I think is the problem. I have the fan cable going to a Zalman Fanmate controller, which may increase the required startup voltage even higher. For reliablity's sake, I recommend picking up the ""E"" version which runs at 1200rpm, and only requires 4.8v startup voltage. Every scythe fan is a great sound performer, so you will still be happy with how quiet in runs!!"
5,Great Family Comedy,Robert Guillaume is one of the best comics in the business and does it without resorting to vulgar language or crass stereotypes. Still as fresh as it was so many years ago. And the guest spots by Ted Danson were a refreshing counterpoint to his babe magnet role as Sam Malone. And even the spots by Seinfeld were interesting. Can't wait for the next season to be released.
1,SHOCKING AND DISAPPOINTING,"My daughter and I were ecstatic that we were finally getting to watch Season 2 of our favourite show. Imagine our disappointment that the one of the DVDs was scratched and the other two are unreadable in 3 DVD players. For the price listed, why am I getting a copied disc. I buy from Amazon and not a street vendor because I want a quality product that I can keep. Now what do I do with these useless 3 discs. Two cannot be read and the one disc that can be read is damaged and freezing. I trust that amazon.com will address this issue urgently."
2,deleted episodes and added ones,"received season2 from wb episode 1 was missing disc3 they were outof order,and the strangest part was the last 2 episodes were episodes 1&2 from season3???????????"
5,Season 2 Release...finally!,"The Season 2 is finally coming on April 3, according to tvshowsondvd.com. Watched the first episode of season 2 here on Amazon, and it will be well worth the wait. See the link here that gives specifics. [...]"
2,TV Generation,"After waiting 5 years for Sony to ""pull their finger out"" and release Benson Season 2, after all the other reviews, I will delay buying it, because of the poor NO QUALITY release!NO TV Series single season should be more than $10 for 20-25 episodes! If this is as bad as everyone says then AMAZON should sell it for ONLY $2 EACH or improve the quality before release and then ONLY $10 EACH.For those who can THINK (!) wikipedia has episode list for EVERY season!"
2,"good show, bad product","The show is good, the product is BAD. DVD-R's that will only play on one player I own (a region free blu-ray player) and that's not located in a place that is handy for me to watch. I prefer to watch DVDs in a small window on my computer screen while doing other computer tasks, and, since these won't play on my computer (NOT a problem I have had with any other commercial products) I cannot watch these in my usual way, in the time I have available. It may take months for me to watch the whole thing.Also, there is no list of episodes on the case or even printed on the discs, so one actually has to insert them in the drive to search for a particular episode.This inferior product should be cheaper than a normal product that plays where the buyer chooses to watch it."
1,very disappointed,"I received the first dvd set and the second disc was totally blank.after waiting so long for it to come out I was very disappointed. After returning 3 sets and getting a fourth set, ALL four sets had the same issue. I was told that Amazon would pull dvd from internet until they could resolve the problem, but it is still for sale. Others must have had the same problem."
1,Can I give it 0 Stars?,"I purchased this thing in person, from a ""big box"" store. It was $110 and while it LOOKS good in the picture it is not sturdy AT ALL. I have a lot of experience putting furniture together being a regular IKEA shopper so I know I didn't do it wrong. The ""wood"" was flaking off in chunks before I even got it out of the box. The plastic ""trim"" around the edges of the wood was peeling off right out of the box. After putting it together and seeing how easy it is to tip over I may just throw it away even though it was over $100. Oh and the cute little ""privacy screen"" at the bottom? Well this desk must have been designed by a non-computer user because it makes it so you can't plug in any of your cables to the back of the machine! I hate it so much I looked everywhere online to find a place I could review it to warn others to please not purchase this desk."
5,Terrific.,"With the suspense filled plot, it kept me wondering what was going to happen next. And the end made it all the more worth it. WOW, WOW & WOW!!! Definitely didn't see that coming. Great job to the producers and the film makers. I look forward to more great work from you guys. Definitely one of the best African themed movies I've seen. Rated 5 stars in my book."
5,Took my breath away!,"Having read Kent Week's book ""The Lost Tomb"" I was impressed with his accessable writing style. So, seeing this book was like waving a red flag at a bull. I have been to many of the sights featured in this book and could not afford to visit all. To my joy, on opening this volume and seeing the quality of the photographs I realised now that I could! It is the next best thing to actually BEING tere and in some cases .. better! I know that sounds odd ... but in reality a lot of the KV paintings are covered with glass to prevent damage ... or you are not allowed to take a camera in ... even if you can, you may not use flash. So your own pictures always fall short. THIS is professionally lit, photographed and documented ... with great care taken to render the Theabian west bank in all it's glory. Bravo!"
1,Weeks does more damage than good,"Weeks' excavation techniques are totally atrocious. He has caused a great deal of damage to be done in the Valley of the Kings by allowing expanded limestone, painted walls to contract too rapidly, thus making the walls and roofs collapse and crack. It is hard to believe that for someone so interested in this area that he would totally ignore conservation aspects. Please don't buy this book and know that you are saving a treasure! Look for ""THE COMPLETE VALLEY OF THE KINGS"" by Reeves and Wilkinson for a better read anyway."
3,Mediocre.,"Marc Em mix is OK...nothing spectacular. The original Good God which is featured on here is the BEST metal song of all time, right next to ADIDAS.The ""Kronic bass mix"" or whatever is interesting and unique, but again...its just OK.Same goes for the ""Headknot"" one, which can also be found on the other (superior) Good God singles. ""Headknot"" is quite repetivie though. They could have at least spiced it up a little bit.What the hell though, buy this one. Its not bad or anything. But compared to the originals on Life is Peachy, its just plain mediocre."
2,too hyper,"As a massage therapist, i was disappointed. It is way too hyper, my clients and myself couldn't feel relaxed listening to it. Maybe in my living room, turned down all the way..... If you are looking for relaxing massage music, this is not what you should buy."
3,"Not bad, but REALLY light.","This music is so light, I forget that it's on. It's not a bad compilation of Mozart, but definately not one of his best. However, just right for a quiet time in the evening."
5,I Love It!,"this is perfect for getting rid of ugly trash cans. fits under the kitchen sink. Never bought replacement bags, the plastic ones from the grocery, wal-mart, etc fit perfectly and the handles become the way to tie it closed. May not be suitable if you have LOTS of trash."
5,Extrufix - Best Design for Ease-of-Use and Longevity,"This 15 litre cabinet Sack Rack (Rack Sack) is near original design by the original Extrufix company. This next generation design still has the simple lightweight lid, but the lower section which holds a bag roll now hooks onto to the upper half. The original design was single frame with lid. Sunbeam 15 liter/3 Gal bags fit perfectly or use grocery bags. Dimensions are 15H x 10.5W x 7D."
5,Every Summer!,"Every Summer is a fantastic ""hook-laden"" pop debut release from Stephen Lawrenson. A big ""Wow"". This cd is filled with tunes that you find yourself humming for days thereafter. It serves-up elements of classic Beatlesque pop that is both retro and refreshing in an Adrien Belew kind-of-way. This is self-production at its best... every note preformed by Stephen himself; the vocals, harmonies, instrumentation, phrasing, lyrics... the works! Buy this cd! It has all the stuff that great pop music is... and it is."
4,Excellent book with great practical reviews and tips,These books have been very helpful on our two trips to Europe. I have found every hotel review to be accurate. The authors also give great ideas for side trips and useful maps. You can plan your whole vacation using these books.If you want to find charming smaller hotels in Europe this books is your best bet. If you prefer a larger American Style hotel or resort this is not the book for you.
3,K. Brown Charming Inns - Germany,"Good review and comments on Inns and small hotels in Germany. Do not look for large or business hotels!!! It is also somewhat cumbersome to look for the direct e-mail to contact a property, since you have to go first to karen brown e-mail and then it will direct you to the property e-mail. Also, out of five searches, I could not reach one of them.Overall, it is a good help if you are searching for this kind of lodging in Germany."
3,Oh Man,"Money, why dident they give them more money. This is a disaster for fans. It barly passes of as a blockbuster. All they needed was money. The acting is less than satifactory and the effects are too low budget.

4,Reviving the lost art of Satire,Its amazing how many reviewers missed the point od this film. It's over-the-top pro-military message and its commentary on the misuse of organized religion should'nt have flown over the heads of most viewers - but I guess it did. Shovels? Hanging war protesters? The Singing Air Marxhall? I was laughing through the whole movie. This is not just another dumb action film.
1,This movie is made by Bible Thumpers.,"Starship Troopers ""ONE"", was a good movie. However Starship Troopers ""THREE"", REALY SUCKED. The first movie was sarcastic about government and war. But the Bush empire was still in power 2008. Looks like they helped make a science fiction movie where Jesus is the salvation. They have the RIGHT answers to many things in life right? WRONG."
2,I'm Being Nice with the 2 Stars!!!,"I'm watching this movie now and within 5 minutes into the movie. I am ready to turn this corny, ill-written, and badly produced movie out the window. The acting is pretty horrible as well.But ST3 is better then ST2."
3,It's all about satire...,"There are some people who panned the movie for visual effects (which looked like they were done on a Commodore 128) or the acting (which was wooden in some spots and just silly in others, parroting lines made famous in the first movie) but the satire value was priceless. You can see the movie poking fun at current events of the last 5 years of war in Iraq. The Federation lowering it's enlistment age to 16, lowering standards of it's forces, the prosecution of those who speak out against the war, Hanging Supreme Court Judges. I loved it for it's satirical biting sarcasm at the current events that we face today. For everything else...eh!"
1,starship pooper,"When I heard there was a part three, but this time bringing back a main character (Johnny Rico) I was looking forward to it. I find it easier to watch a sequel movie if they bring back the characters and actors from the previous film. But in this case........ what the hell were they thinking or smoking when they made this embarrassment. It's almost like the studio was taking bets on who would actually see this and like it. Jolene Blalok, was the hot spot on Star Trek, Enterprise, but was luke warm and forgettable in this mess. Casper Van Dien was hurtin in this film in trying to revive Johnny Rico. This film proved things can get worse as the story goes, leaving the viewers to fast forward to find a part that's not to painful to watch. Let's hope they put this franchise out of it's misery and ours."
1,Pretend this movie wasn't made,"So you enjoyed the first movie? It was good acting, good cg, and well, just plain good. Then the second Starship Troopers came out... Starting going downhill fast with a shoddy attempt at a horror movie. Then this abomination of a movie was made.Music: Almost thought it was a musical rather than an action flick...Acting: BadCG: BADStory: REALLY BADGore: think scifi original B movie bad-Minor Spoiler-Everything you enjoyed of the original movie is gone, and it's replaced with, well, Jesus (yes, Jesus)/bad cg/bad acting. The director decided everyone needed to find Jesus to kill the bugs. And there is even a bug ""God"" as well, but since he's a false idol, well you know how that goes. I watched this on Netflix first, I am glad I didn't pay money for it. I'm livid that I wasted my time to watching it. So I figured I'd warn all others out there hoping for something good and tell you it's rubbish. Pretend 2 and 3 were never made and stick with the original."
1,Story had potential,"If you watch SciFi you know that aliens can take over human's minds. This is the worst execution of this plot line I have ever seen. The dialog could have been written by a teenager. None of the interactions between the characters seemed natural. And where do you find a stewardess assigned to a military starship! The 30 seconds of nudity in the movie seems totally misplaced, and does not do anything for the story. Some of the special effects are amateurish at best while some are good. A lot of time was taken to make good effects of exploding body parts with lots of blood splashing around. The only good part of this movie was the bugs, probably because they did not have any dialogue. You can watch this movie for free on Crackle, it is not worth owning it."
1,What were they thinking?,"I loved the original starship troopers and the animated series but when they made direct to video releases they looked interesting from the trailers. I finally checked this one out, the story is bad! charectors you don't care about, special effects in night scenes looks alright but in day time looks like fake cgi. best part is the fight at the end. nothing really is that memorable except for the lame song the guy keeps singing through out the entire movie which is annoying along with the cringe worthy dialogue. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."
4,Great Movie,Best sequel to the series. Brought back main characters from first movie and continued with the main plot of the movie.
3,Hilariously terrible,"It's fairly obvious that the people making this movie were not trying to be serious about it. This film has the potential to be an all-time cult classic, precisely because it's so absolutely horrible and fully aware of the fact that it's horrible. Partway through it turns into some bizarre Christian allegory, and the effects are, at times, worthy of the greatest (worst?) B-movies. The dialogue is cheesy, corny, and alternately slapstick. The actors are trying their best to do a ""serious"" camp movie, and at least in that regard they are successful."
4,Cheesy campy fun!,The Bottom Line:The special effects are laughably terrible (notice how you never see a bug get shot since that's more complicated CGI) and the acting and writing are a joke but the movie's so much fun you'll hardly notice; whether you're a fan or not of the first one you'll almost certainly enjoy this silly little film with its light satire and catchy theme song.2.5/4
1,Not better than Starship Troopers 2,"Okay, Starship Troopers 2 didn't follow the mold created by #1, but it was watchable. Marauder is only worth watching to have said you've seen it. It is totally humorless, the nudity is not believable, entirely gratuitous, except to give it an R rating, and badly done. Worst, it doesn't include Ms. Blalock. In Marauder, the Marauders are shown almost as an afterthought, and are not particularly well done. The giant brain bug is shown as occupying a portion of the planet, but is utterly unconvincing. The role of religion is taken seriously and even respected. Yes, maybe the bugs do deserve to win... The coup de graceless was having the destruction of the planet blocked by the unlikely wedding embrace. No, this movie, while truer to #1 in action, was worse than Hero of the Federation. This is strictly a rent and return; don't waste your money unless you can spare it."
1,Science fiction movie,The worst of the three. Even Jolen Blalock could not carry this movie.It was very poorly written. The special effects were less than they should have been. A waste of time.
2,Fair Film,"This is second best of the Starship Troopers movie series. If you are into collecting the set this is a good addition. The story falls short with weak concept and was forced to again show the John Rico character. The Maurader program has little to do with the movie. Writing is poor, story development is poor, but at least it is better than Starship Troopers 2."
4,Very Good Entertainment,"First let me say that the rating system of 5 stars does not really allow for the wide spectrum of movies being made. Most people, (myself included), tend to give five stars to movies we like. What about the movies we love, or movie classics. On a fair rating system I would only give STARSHIP TROOPERS 3 a three star rating, but to do that when I really enjoyed watching it seems wrong. So here I am giving a good movie four stars when it really fits in to the middle group of acceptable SF films out there. But is it fun? Yes."
4,Rate It in the B-Movie Category and It Earns 4 Stars ****,"Aw, come on you science fiction fanatics! It's a B-Movie so rate it against other B-Movies and it earns 4 stars! Yes, I would have loved to have it made with the budget of the Transformers, but the studio didn't and should have. Yes, the 2nd movie in this series definitely bit the big one and deserved a big 1 rating...if that. But this little gem has action, corny lines, not too bad of special effects for their budget, and a very good plot! I loved it! Highly recommend to any fan of Starship Troopers genre!! The Maraders kicked #%@$!!! Make some more Trooper movies of this caliber and I'll be a happy camper!"
3,Marauder in Last,Expected the Marauder make it's entry much earlier.. it was in the last of the movie.. hope the next ST4 wil be better
4,Good movie needs more action and different writers,This movie was great in the way it actually had mech suits and some action. But the majority of the movie was spent on character relationships. It seemed like all the creativity of the original was ignored. If it had different writers it may have been a big hit in theaters
2,Direct to Video For a Reason,"I had high hopes for this 2nd sequel attempt. There were a few good moments but unfortunately they were all in the (almost) satirical news and recruitment inserts. A limited budget and second-rate acting and scripting is painfully apparent. If you, like me, have a guilty pleasure in liking the original, than your best bet is to ignore the 2 uninspired sequels and find instead 'Roughnecks - The Starship Troopers Chronicles - The Complete Campaigns' which is available for purchase on Amazon."
1,A Right-Wing/Religious Propaganda trash,"This is an unabashedly right wing propaganda film, Joseph Goebbels would have been proud of this one. There are no subtleties here. It's in your face demonizing war protestors and executing them (a right wing wet dream). But wait, there's more. Just when you think the movie had thrown in all the Right-Wing talking points. It poured in the religious stuff. You feel yourself gasping for unadulterated fresh clean air after being saturated in this muck."
3,Rent me if you must,"The first Starship Troopers was not that good anyway but it was entertaining. This was, while not as bad as the 2nd one, still was not very good. The story jumps around alot and there seem to be no reason for things. Not the best movie for dtae night or the kids. There is nudity in the movie so be careful if you have kids."
2,Starship Troopers 3: Marauder is not as good as the original but much better than the 2nd one.,"Starship Troopers 3: Marauder is not as good as the original but much better than the 2nd movie. I loved the book, and enjoyed the first movie but didn't enjoy the 2nd. The third one wasn't all that good, but wasn't a waste of time."
1,Back to the Future with prayer!,"While they actually got back to the original book of a military totalitarian state, it was not as benevolent as RHH had it. However, the blatent sexism, religious intolerance, fundamentalist Xtian propaganda, and contemporary Iraqi War politics was a little bit too much to take. I am really really really really glad I did not pay anywhere near full price.On the plus side, I am glad that they finally got back to the original concept of the Mobile Infantry, Drop Ships, and Powered Armored Fighting Suits.And by the way-having been in a real navy, the Federation Naval Damage Control System really sucks. It's a wonder they have any ships left at all.I also agree with many others-the acting was even worse."
3,"Very enjoyable ""B"" movie","Don't expect high drama or high budget, but the acting is good (mostly) and the editing is first-rate. This is a light, stand alone feature that is entertaining and will occasionally make you laugh.Things to note:- There are some quick tongue-in-cheek jabs at Bush and the Iraq war but these are one-offs and not a theme.- There is some upper-body nudity in 1 short scene.- There is occasional comic-book gore.- Religion is a central theme but is handled fairly well.The ending makes it seem like there is more to come. That's a good thing.PS - See this 10 times before you see No Country for Old Men. Word."
3,Was definitely on a budget,"This franchise went the way of Planet of the Apes. First movie, huge budget...by the third, you wonder why they even bothered. Sad way to see Heinlein represented."
2,com on ya apes are ya gonna snore forever,"when the movie first started i knew there was a problem wheres the title music from the 1st two movies?, the dialogue of this film was crappy, dont get me wrong im glad casper is back and all but geez this film will put you to sleep quick, it doesnt even match up to hero of the federation...and that one was pretty bad,you will not want to rewatch this film if you can get thru it the first time. all we can do is hope the next one redeems the series."
2,Let the bugs win!,"If you are wanting for another taste of Starship Troopers well here it is. The script is mostly ludicrious, but it does strive to rise above being just a mindless pure action story. The military angle is especially unrealistic. The direction is both ackward and amateurist, and puts you off from getting involved in the story. This francise has a good basic concept, I would like to see someone who has a correct approach tackle it."
2,Troopers,"Starship Troopers 3: MarauderA good sequel with good FX, but story could be better. The religious character is whiny and annoying."
3,"This is okay, but the first Starship Troopers remains the best","One thing I will admit though is that this movie has a lot of gorgeous girls in uniform. It's like a professional looking, smart babefest. Check out these actresses: Joline Blalock as Captain Lola Beck, Marnette Patterson as Holly Little, Cecile Breccia as Lt. Link Manion, Tanya Van Graan as Sgt. Sunday, and Nicole Tupper as Sgt. Kirby.I'd like to see all these girls together in another kind of movie. Like a genuinely tasteless, sex comedy ""babefest.""I definately liked Joline. She's hot!!"
1,Total waste of time,"I could only stand to watch half of this terrible movie before I ejected it from my player. I liked the first one and had hopes for this one but it's a complete waste of time.Bad acting, bad script, 2nd rate special effects, etc..."
1,Starship Troopers 3,This movie sucked so bad that I turned it off with in 5 minutes of starting it. IT WAS A DISGRACE!
2,Too Much Preaching,"If you expect another ""Bug Battle"" - this movie delivers. But the movie goes over board with it's message that ""religious"" belief is for the weak minded. I just wanted an entertaining SciFi show, but got a sermon instead. Don't bother with this ""message"" driven movie, instead watch the first one or even the second movie, the animated series is ok - or just read the book."
1,Horriffic!,This third installment is an absolute disaster! Please! save your money do not buy this movie!
1,What the?,"Such a failure. I'm a big fan of the first and couldn't even finish watching this one. I had to turn it off. Please, please, please dont buy/rent or waste time on this movie. Part 1 was ahead of it's time andthis one does not even hold a spark to it. Not even a tiny spark. The actors sounded like robots and the bugs. Well 3D crapamation?Simple review. Dont watch, wait for TV. It's that bad so not even that."
1,"A Truly Awful, Awful Film","Some time ago, critics rated ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"" as the worse film ever made. Now ""Plan Nine"" is in second place on that list. This film is horrendous. The plot is stupid. The dialogue is stupid. Everything about this film is moronic. The writer/director tries to make some political/theological points but they are as infantile as his movie. The original 'Starship Trooper"" was, at best, only fair. But this film is garbage. Save your money."
1,STINKER - Don't Waste Your Time (Like I Wasted Mine!),"I was really hoping that this movie would have some redeeming value. It does not. Bad storyline, bad dialog, just plain bad all the way around. Makes you hope the Bugs take Hollywood.I enjoyed the book by Heinlein, and enjoyed the first movie, even with it's flaws. However, I literally threw this movie into the trash right after it ended.Can I sue for one and a half hours of my life back?"
1,Dont even bother,"Don't even bother watching this movie. I rented it, curious to see if it lived up the first and second movie... no dice. I did not even bother to finish the movie before returning it. If you have a dire need to see this movie, please rent it first before you potentially waste your money with a purchase."
1,Not as good,"Not as good as #1. They just keep missing the mark. And face it, everyone was hoping to see Jolene Blalock in the all together. No penny this time!"
1,What A shame,"This is the third in the series and while better then the second it is nowhere near the first in script quality. There is eye candy for both men and women and that is the good part. Its worth watching if someone else bought it. If they go to #4 they need to bring back Denise Richardson and get a ""Wild Things"" in space thing going on."
3,Great quirkyness,"I always found that science fiction is a little more than marauders being chased by the evil empire in great starships...or ones that defy going into space. The message conveyed in Star Ship Trooper, and equally true in the first one, is the brainwashing, the excuses for the brainwashing, and defying the brainwashing. The good guys, and the bad guys die for what they believe in, and morality (or is it?) wins at the end, just to become the new topic for brainwashing...forever in an infinite circle. ""Forever war"" be remembered. Both this and the original movie stood out for the over acting, the predictable lines, and the story line. But it's good fund to watch. What I don't understand about american films is the lack of subtlety. Do I really need to graphically see decapitate bodies? I really do have an imagination guys."
1,Horrible,"This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.This movie starts out boring, and you just keep waiting to see if it will be redeemed by an interesting plot twist. But no, it just gets worse and worse. The dialogue is so bad it will make you cringe throughout. The climax has two of the main characters repeating the lord's prayer over and over again while the Transformer-suits fight the bugs. You'd think that the writers could have found better dialogue to crib than to just start reading from the bible!Don't waste your time with this one. The script-writers obviously did not."
1,God what a cheesy film!!!!,This film does no justice to the book by Robert Heinlein.The dialog is choppy and ridiculous.Save your money read the book intead.
2,Tired and old,Tired and old. Like the actors and actresses dragged out of their more sedate roles and made-up to do the same old (yamn!) thing of shooting CGI bugs. Nuff said.
3,"Not the Original, but Better than Sequel","Overall, a decent (not good) ""B"" grade science fiction movie. The original Starship Troopers was great. The Sequel - Starship Troopers 2 - was a total flop and a waste of even the $5 I paid for it. This one, although not as bad as the second one, isn't all that great either. The storyline, acting, and special effects are mediocre. As in the first Starship Troopers, they are trying to make a statement - but to the detriment of the plot in this case.If you are a Starship Troopers junkie - I mean that in a good way :) - or you really like low-budget, campy, B-grade science fiction movies, its worth seeing. Otherwise, I'd pass and let the memory of the original Starship Troopers remain unblemished."
2,Laughable,"Really bad, but not useless......like many, I love Heinlein, and poor as this is, it is not disgraceful. Well worth a couple of bux."
2,mindless fun with few twists kinda sucks,cant decide if ok as in zombie movie okdid have cool action scene finally in end but beginning DRAGS
2,NOT GOOD,I bought and received this DVD as new...but it did not work with my PC...it only work with DVD player and the sound is really bad i barely can hear anything.
1,Terrible toy,Our yellow lab chewed through the middle of this bone in a few minutes and turned it into several small pieces. We had to throw it away so she wouldnt eat the pieces. We also bought the Kong ball which has held up great. This bone was a complete waste of money. Definitely not durable.
2,PILATE PORTRAITS,"I think the book would have been more interesting, and apt, if it had lived up to its title by being an illustrated history of Pilate as portrayed through the ages visually in contrast to Christ. His depictions actually stretch in time and place from fourth Christian century Roman sarcophagi to twentieth century Hollywood movies!"
1,"WORST movie ever, and we are HUGE Layton fans.","The story is slow and boring and predictable. There are no surprises and no funny moments. We were anxious for anything Layton as we waited and waited for the new DS game, and had thought that we needed to see this movie to be prepared to play ""Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask"", but that is not the case. It was a waste of money and time. I can't even guess what age group they were shooting for because it's too grown-up for the very youngest viewers who might actually be able to sit through it. Ugh. Just don't bother."
1,A major disappointment.,"I'm a little bewildered. Amazon will only permit a product review if you have purchased the product yet all the above reviews were written months before this product came to market. And after watching this film I believe all four to have been planted.I don't know what age group this film hopes to target. It is far too depressing for children and much too boring for adults. The arcade-y music fights with voices and often wins. The story is banal, the music annoying and the ending not soon enough.Stick to the wonderful DS games! Take a pass on this."
1,Great Graphics- bad message,I bought this based on other reviews and regret buying this Dvd. The graphics are amazing but the story line is filled with reincarnation. If you don't want your kids believing in reincarnation then I don't recommend this movie. I was hoping for a Sherlock Holmes type ending where a the very least the supernatural would be explained away but it wasn't. I would give this movie a 5 for Animation but a 1 for the story.
3,"Good movie, terrible dub.",Okay. Flat out this dvd gets you the bare minimum. There is no bonus content and the dub is a pile of garbage. But seeing as its the only Region 1 release of the DVD if you've seen it before and want to have it you can but watch it with subtitles to get a good experience. Or if you haven't seen this and like the series of games than this is defiantly something that should be taken a look at. It is probably the only GOOD video game movie in the history of history.
3,Reasonable,"Reasonable price, reasonable size, reasonable performance for a small bino.For serious work you have to spend more and lug more."
2,"Binocs okay, warranty sucks","The binoculars were decent when they worked. They were clear enough, so-so at low light conditions and the 12x brought things in very close. They are advertised as having a ""rubber armor"" coating. ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!! I was carrying them out to my car with a hand full of other stuff and they dropped about 3 feet to the ground. Didn't think anything of it until I went to look through them the next day. I WAS SEEING DOUBLE. That tiny little fall killed them. Figured they'd be covered under warranty. NOPE, they offered to sell me another pair at a slight discount because the price to repair was more than a new one. I told them to keep them. Why would I want another pair of crap binoculars? I ended up spending a little more on a lower end NIKON and I haven't looked back. The NIKON's are way better!! I'll never buy another Bushnell based on my experience. There's enough good stuff out there by better companies that I don't need to deal with them ever again."
5,Great deal for a small binicular,"The image is very clear, even in low light! The magnification is great as is the easy of focusing the binocular. The external coating make it easy to grip even in the rain. Would purchase again if I need another pair."
5,Totally accessible for the non-specialist general reader,"Now in a completely updated and expanded third edition, Snoring And Sleep Apnea: Sleep Well, Feel Better continues to be an invaluable resource for anyone afflicted with the health risks and inconvenience of sleep disorders. Sleep Apnea is defined and described, the causes or identified, the relationship of obesity to Sleep Apnea explained, advice on finding a sleep specialist and appropriate treatment are offered -- including alternative medicine with respect to Sleep Apnea. Written so as to be totally accessible for the non-specialist general reader, Snoring And Sleep Apnea is a ""must"" for anyone who suffers, and their friends and family who want to help them cope with and overcome this health-hazardous condition."
2,deceptive publication date,Although there's a recent publication date it has not been updated. Text and pictures are dated. Thus some deception with recent edition date.
3,Needs updating,"OK, I agree with the previous reviewers: it's the classical textbook for GAs. But it definitely needs updating, as it's a 15-year old book and much has been done in the area. Niching methods, for example, are just outlined. I'd recommend Melanie Mitchell's book instead of this one."
3,I didn't like it,Well... The book is not bad but chapter III lacks clarity...Chapter III is supposed to give mathematical insights into genetic algorithms. It starts by proving the schema theorem (which is OK) and then tries to cover the math related to GA's. This chapter is very difficult to follow. Unless you are familar with GA's and the math related to them this chapter is difficult to understand
5,a classic textbook,The examples and code was extremely helpful in clarifying the ideas presented in the text. The treatment I think should appeal to beginners (with some computing experience however) and certainly a pleasure for those advanced programmers who want to learn more about genetic algorithms.
5,"Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization, and Machine Learning by David E. Goldberg",Excellent book for Graduate students and instructors. Highly recommend!
2,Read a review article instead!,"I agree with another reviewer who said the book was unnecessarily long. Genetic Algorithms are a great programming tool, and there are some tips and tricks that can help your programs converge faster and more accurately, but this book had a lot of redundant information.If you are interested in using GA for solution-finding, I doubt you'll find much useful in this book beyond the first chapter or so. Many of the examples later in the book were so specific that I couldn't see how they could be usefully generalized. Really optimizing a GA approach for a specific problem domain takes a fair amount of tuning, and this book won't help much with that.I think time spent surfing siteseer or other publication sites would be better spent than reading this book."
5,excellent product,RECEIVED ON TIME AND INSTALLED INTO VEHICLE. EVERYTHING ON LEVER WORKED FINE. THE QUALITY OF PRODUCT WAS VERY GOOD. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PROUCT.
1,Pure fiction.,"Phil Fullmer is a boil on the backside of colllege football and is not to be trusted. Tennessee used to be a proud and respected football program until this lying cheat stabbed Johnny Majors in the back and got his job. Since then, Tennessee under the leadership of this Judas has became a blight on the landscape of intercollegiate athletics."
1,How I Survived the First Four Years of GW Bush,This is a bit of fluffy nonsense about sex against a background of pseudo-political ramblings.
4,great,Kind of sticky but smell is delicious and it's a very good product to use with dry skin. Ideal for when it's cold or hot. Leaves the skin feeling healthy and hydrated. Price is good. I would use it over and over again
5,healthy cereal,"puffed kamut is bigger and better tasting than it's cousin, puffed wheat. puffed kamut is filling, very good taste. low in carbohydrates, good source of fiber. no added sugar, salt, or fat.i eat it as a snack sometimes. great way to start or end your day"
1,Last 3 cases have been stale,"I purchased the cases of this cereal because it is organic, it fills me up, and due to the nose dive recognized within the U.S. economy over the past four years, I am no longer able to afford much.Unfortunately, the last three cases I have ordered via Amazon have been stale. I contemplated leaving this feedback because I am just thankful to have anything to eat. However, after three cases of stale cereal that leaves an after taste due to the stale quality, I am having a difficult time stomaching this cereal anymore.For a couple more dollars, which I really did now wish to spend, but I am going to try to do so now, I have found that Nature's Path Kamut Puffs are ""by far"" extremely fresh in comparison. It may be the Eco-bag that Nature's Path packages their cereal in, verses the softer plastic that Arrowhead packages their cereal in. Not sure."
5,I am in love,I have purchased these cereal for about four years now. I am in love with this flavor. It has such a more distinct flavor than regular wheat. The kernels are about twice the size of puffed wheat as well. You can not go wrong with this. I have it on autoship. I eat it with soy or almond milk for breakfast most days. If you are looking for a new cereal without all the sugar and high fructose corn syrup try this organic deliciousness for a change.
3,Get intouch with yourself!,This book will help you get intouch with yourself - especially if your feeling lost!
3,Book already donated.,"This book did not ""make the cut"" on my bookshelf. I wish Richardson would quit cranking out books... this talented woman should write a definitive guide..."
2,A Christian Critique,"As a Christian, I found that the author's ""SpiritualPrinciples"" were heavily New Age. While the advice is good andif you read consciously mentally replacing ""the Universe""with God and ""the Inner Voice"" with the Holy Spirit, the 7steps can be useful to better managing your life. Shortly afterreading this book, I found ""Reinventing Your Life WithGrace"" a 4 tape series from Woman of Faith... This is a ChristianBible based series that I feel would be of better value to a Christianwho is looking to reinvent their life and de-stress."
1,Another Mediocre Book!,"This kinds of book make American society become narcisstic and apathetic, thinking only about their gated community and self righteousness. The attitude, ""just as long as I am obeying the law, I don't care of people dying in the streets"". I don't suggest women reading this book, it would encourage the reader to take a passive stance in life, which would destroy the essence of being a true human. Just an opinion!"
1,Probably the silliest book I have ever read,"... and dangerous, too. Encourages selfishness and egotism (Page 12: ""You think selfish is a dirty word"".. go on, be selfish.)Whatever good there is in the American way of life, it didn't come from stuff like this."
2,The same thing for less + not a book for me.................,"I think this book isn't to get to know your authentic self, just like Lifestyle makeovers. Although I haven't read it I know her style, because I have subscribed to her newsletter, for which you can go to her website (cherylrichardson.com). I like Phil McGraw more, although he can be quite harsh. It's just that it's more a feel good book, if you know what I mean?"
2,Not helpful for me...........,"As someone who is firmly based in reality, the mystical content of this book was meaningless. For example, Cheryl asserts that you only need to think (or write) positive thoughts and they will magically happen for you with no effort! People who are into mysticism will like all this, but as someone who understands that Law of Identity, it comes across as silly.Also, the practical advice that was presented was mundane. We all know to we should exercise and balance our checkbooks and eat well and get enough sleep. Nothing new here.Some of the lists were good and a couple of the stories were interesting.I so wish that there were rational coaching books out there!!!!!!!!"
3,"For those who like positive affirmations, this is your book","For books of this type, this isn't bad. I would strongly recommend a book like this should be balanced with one a bit more firmly routed in the real world. ""Filling the Glass,"" while ostensibly a business book covers much the same ground with a more hardheaded practicality. Yet that very hardheadedness makes its ultimately uplifting message far more effective. ""Shakelton's Way"" is another excellent example--again ostensibly a business book but one that has wonderful insights into improving the qualtiy of your personal life as well. Nothing wrong with positive affirmation--just don't expect them to work without doing the necessary practical groundwork."
3,Take Time,"I thought the suggestions were very good. However, I did not like how one is suppose to find someone else and do the program with them along the way. That has never worked for me.There were good suggestions about getting rid of the clutter in your life and about spirituality."
3,not what I expected,"I am still reading this book and haven't started the program yet. I was very surprised to learn that to successfully complete the program the author asks that you have a partner or create a group, all committed to step by step, chapter by chapter, month by month, go through the book and support each other. I think people should know this before they buy the book! I don't think I would have bought the book knowing this. Maybe I will write another review when I finish!"
5,"If you can only buy one book, this is the one!","If you knew the woman who wrote this book, you'd understand why Take Time For Your Life is destined to be a best seller. Cheryl Richardson is a magnificent woman with a beautiful soul who profoundly touches lives wherever she goes.Two years ago, I was blessed to have Cheryl come into my life. Nothing has been the same since. I've built a highly successful business by pioneering a new profession, I've built reserves of time, love, money, community, and I am actively involved in taking great care of me. With her coaching, I've radically transformed my life and work. Her book includes many of the exercises and ideas she uses in her work with me and her other clients. Please don't miss the opportunity to learn and grow in ways you can only dream about. Buy her book -- and start living the life of your dreams!"
4,works for those who work it,"i've only purchased the product once. i see so many comments about the smell but to me it reminds me of salt and vinegar potato chips, with an added apple scent. the jar seemed to last me forever. i think i did about 8 overnight treatments, and i would add it to my roots and brush back definetly slicked them down nicely, the grapeseed oil does help to soften the hair. i've gone to their website and notice they said to use velcro rollers to help with the stretching overnight, and that it should also be pulled while drying. i think it works at least you could use it like a detangler definetly helped me while i was transitioning. i will probably buy it again if i don't find a way to perfect another natural stretching option through using coconut milk and lime or bentonite clay i hear there are quite a few ways out there so i'm just exploring other options rather than giving up and buying the $20 jar again. $20 can buy a heck of alot of coconut and limes"
1,Don't do it,"I am a west indian of mixed heritage--I have the hair of my african ancestors. It is super curly --nothing can get the curl out--not even a relaxer. If the relaxer gets the curl out it also eats up the hair. I did locs for 4 years--it takes a lot of time for your true hair texture to come back after you stop using relaxers. The hair I had when I started going nature is no the hair I ended up with. I love my curls but I had a problem with the shrinkage!! My hair is shoulder length but it shrinks up close to my head when dry--no matter what products I use. Okay thats the background--This product did relax the curl a bit but it made it dry, dry, dry, and frizzy. The part that scares me is that I could hear my hair breaking when I combed through my hair. I curled my hair w/ the product and left it on overnite. I am hoping my hair will revert back..but probably not."
3,Heavy Vinegar Smell,"I tried this with my daughter's hair (thick, wavy, fly-away) hoping to tame it. I never seemed to get the results I wanted, but I would like to mention the smell is less than pleasant. To me it smells just like vinegar. It does seem to go away after the hair dries, but I did not put it in thickly, so your milage may vary."
1,No good,It didn't do what it said it would a waste of money.I want buy it again. the produce is no good for straightener out your hair. My hair isn't straight at all.
3,No real difference from before I used it,I bought this product from Walgreen for roughly 10 dollars. I never finished it. I did multiple applications and noticed no difference in texture which is what I was looking for. I have 4c hair and was looking for something that would make my hair easier to detangle. This did nothing.
1,Horrible,"This product smelled really strong and it made my daughters hair itch like crazy. My daughter has not had a perm in 4 months do i wanted to try something a little less harsh on her scalp. When I tried washing it out, it left it tangled. I thought It was more like a natural product but it wasn't. Not worth the buy."
1,Does Not Work!,"I had high hopes for the curlaway relaxer, but I was very disappointed. I have been using it almost everyday for two weeks, I followed the directions on the box. But no results AT ALL! I tried leaving it in my hair overnight, and also as a leave in Conditioner, and it did not work at all. It is a waste of time and money. Plus, you have to deal with that aweful smell of ""sour apple"". I am hoping to return it, and to get my money back. Exremely Unsatisfied."
4,I love this stuff!,"This product does just what it says it will. I use it as a leave in conditioner so I haven't quite achieved the straight look, but I have noticed my hair is smoother and more manageable. It also doesn't frizz up in damp weather anymore. If used properly, this product is great!"
1,Only a skunk could love!,This product contains a known eye irritant which might be forgivable if the product did not have to remain in the hair a minimum of 3 hrs. This would also be forgivable if it had a tolerable scent. The stench is so bad that my husband actually gets angry with me for wearing it around him. My daughter does not want to be around me for the same reason. You cannot go anywhere with this product in your hair unless you enjoy people moving away from you to avoid the odor. Essentially this is only a usable product if you are a skunk or do not live among the human population. Questionably in the ingredient list all the ingredients are not listed. If this company could make the smell of this product tolerable it seems to produce results even if at a snails pace. I would have given this product 5 stars if it had had a pleasant odor; as it is I WARN EVERYONE TO STEER CLEAR and search for an alternative product.
1,"Smells awful, Time consuming, and take hair out","I bought this first from walgreens, and when I used it it seem to very gradually loosen my hair. Since it was natural , I kept using it but my hair seem to be getting shorter. I thought it was my imagination, however when my Mother told me I lost two inches. I knew it was real. It ONLY straighten my hair about 5 percent and it took out my hair. I could have got a relaxer at that rate which only takes about an hour."
5,"Finaly, Soft Cell's videos on DVD !","This is just great.Since the 1983 issue of the 'Non Stop Exotic Video Show' on VHS which became a collectors item, we weren't able to obtain those videos, and now, here they are !Lead singer Marc Almond (along with Dave Ball) is showing his theatrical skills while presenting the videos in a non stop show of men, women, animals and dwarves ? Really some bizarre person !And what do we have here ?So, we have entertain me, bedsitter, frustration, torch, seedy films, secret life, youth, tainted love, memorabilia, sex dwarf, what, say hello wave goodbye.I really love this one ! This one is my favorite !"
4,Great Product,Works as advertised. I had no problem with product installation. This made the Receiver installation a lot easier and faster.
2,"Creepy, I skipped the morose stuff.","This book oddly jumped between an interesting view of the human body and, in particular, the immune system, to creepy and morbid personal memories of the author. Ick."
1,Absolute AVOID this one,"This is a typical Que effort, probably written in about 4 days, by paraphrasing pre-existing materials, including documentation you receive with the software. Also not updated for 8i, they added a few paragraphs at the beginning about new features, but didn't work through those features in the rest of the book. Poorly indexed, poorly edited (both as to explanations and # typos), way too many screen shots, just way too big."
1,I am VERY unhappy,"I am extremely unhappy with this book. I found several errors. Some of the parameters that it suggests using on an Oracle 8/8i do not work as they are now obsolete. Although they work in an Oracle 7.x environment, they will cause your 8.x database to not startup! (Yes, I tested them before I posted this message) The rest of the book is vague and generally unhelpful. I am extremely disappointed and not sure that I will EVER purchase another book from QUE again!"
3,Good attempt to make a straight to the point techcl. book,"Considering that most of the Oracle DBA books on the market are simply horrible, filling hundreds of pages with unneeded info, this book is the first attempt to make a purely technical, no nonesense reference guide for DBAs to use. Those new to Oracle 8 will get a good introduction to new features. However, do not look for a recipe to install Oracle on Unix, do backup and recovery, set up the OS environment, etc. For these critical and complex tasks the book follows the old industry tradition: it gently touches upon these topics... and moves on."
3,Oraclie 8i,"User-level is listed as intermediate-advanced, certainly cannot be used as a beginner's only handbook, will not give the beginner a reliable grounding in the topic. Supposedly can be used as a learner's or a reference book, in my opinion, is neither. Which is the problem with this sort of work. Much valuable information contained, but with so many different authors there is no clear development or common style, rather atomic chapters, at times repeating the same information in a somewhat different fashion. Index is spotty. (Maybe this is an appropriate style for Oracle DBMS?). Is worth a read, does cover 8/8i and does contain Oracle 8i Personal Edition CD."
3,Not too deep but deep enough,"If you're a newcomer in the DBA-field, this book provides a good overview of Oracle8. If you're an experienced Oracle7 DBA, looking to enhance you're knowledge of Oracle8, you won't find the indepth information you're looking for in this book. More so, because the co-authors have different styles of writing about their own subjects. For instance, I found the information about ""materialized views"" (only mentioned ones) too short. Instead, a subject like Designer was too elaborate for my taste. Still, if you're new in the field and looking for a comprehensive guide, this book is good value for money."
3,Interesting To Read But Not a Good Reference Book,I think the author knows the material but is isn't presented very well. The book doesn't seem to flow. It is interesting to read and the author gives tips (the best part) that you don't see in other books but it is not good enough to be used as a valuable Oracle reference. Better books exist for that.
5,Excellent Conclusion,"This second and final volume contains (in English translations) the third and fourth books of the French series.It takes the main character from the rich tool of a corrupt family in a corrupt Latin American country (where we left him at the end of the first volume) into the desert, where he cons the religious poor... until he has a change of heart -- but a believable, moving one.It won't disappoint: the art and the story are both quite fine. And you certainly won't be bored. With Jodorowsky, you never know where the story will go.-- Julian Darius, Sequart.com (for the sophisticated study of comic books and graphic novels)"
1,annoying,"If music is composed to be heard while reading a book, if books are written to be read with kitschy music, torn out of its context, and both created to fall asleep, then: buy this CD, philistine!"
5,Icing on Cornbread,"I loved this book but I would like to see it in print as I have many friends that don't have the ability to read on a computer. Every family should read this. A fiction that leaves you feeling good. A story with a happy ending. This book made an old woman cry, laugh and feel good about future generations. My friends would love it. I am an 82 year old woman and have read many books. This one is a keeper. Thank you Harrytru."
4,Learn to express yourself with another 'language',"This book offers your the essential technique to solidify your designing ideas onto the drafts and then the blueprints. Also, you will learn from this book the rules and concepts for architecture designing."
1,Don't waste your money.,"The lollipop itself is vabout an inch thick, but is only about two inches in length. The taste of the coating seems off somehow, and it was unpleasant at first but I got used to it. The scorpion inside is minuscule at best, and disgustingly unedible. The body is crunchy and doesn't break down well, with a strong sesame seed type taste. It was gross, and I can't believe I paid that much for one."
1,Derek Lee Ragin - Negro Spirituals/Moses Hogan Chorale,"Please offer listening samples.Moses Hogan I am very familiar with, but I have only heard Derek sing one song. I would like to hear more of him before I purchase. Thanks."
4,Love it,"I LOVE the feel of this soap. It's lather is wonderful, the only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because my skin feels alittle bit dry after use."
3,Haven't seen any difference,I read the glowing reviews which is why I purchased it but I haven't seen the results that was talked about in the reviews I guess if I purchased another bottle my skin may become clearer. It does have a nice fragrance to it.
4,Smells yummy,"I liked how it really lathered, and it smelled very sweet. I also noticed a few bumps go away after a period of time."
4,african black soap,I love this soap but it is inconsistent. Sometimes it has the exfoliating beads and sometimes it dosent. I would like it to be more consistent.
4,My husband likes this,This is one of the few natural products that I could find that has no coconut in it and is still effective. My husband likes this soap in particular.
5,if you like the bar version you'll love this,"the bar version is my favorite soap, so i thought i would try this liquid body wash. it is everything the bar is and more. sometimes the bar can seem rough on your skin, but this eliminates that altogether. a little goes a long way when used with a puff instead of a washcloth(or just your hand). great scent and keeps my skin free of blemishes. i use it as a wash and shampoo. really fantastic- if you've never tried these soaps you owe it to yourself to try(and no, you don't have to be black to try these, they work for just about any skin type)."
4,Finding Love,"Christine Townsend introduces two loving, but single parents who go out of their way to take care of their children, but when they are forced to help one another not only do their parenting styles bump heads, but their personalities begin to spark and the dance of passion begins."
3,A True Love Story,This story is for newlyweds especially those who have their difficulties at first and who are not getting what they want but like any marriage how to solve that is to be open and to talk about it.This is a really good book and a true story of love.
4,Dare to own me,"The Daredevil toy is not bad although the head seems small for the body,more of a Marvel comic type I guess,It has large red oven-mit gloves that seem to belong to Capt.Amaerica.The boots are almost larger than needed,it also has bare feet.not so bad as a total loss but a little refinement is needed before this lad goes out to battle.Not bad for the money because it was less than the others."
4,Excellent book,"I am not into poetry and quipful writing, but this book certainly touches your heart, especially if you have lost a fur baby that you loved. The only drawback is one that the author cannot help, and that is that when you read the book, your grief is compounded by the emotional writings/poetry. On one hand it lifted me up, but on the other it did little to help my grief. I do recommend it to everyone, but I recommend you wait until your personal pain has subsided a bit. Good work."
4,Fantastic collection of references for the Apollo 8 flight.,"If you're a space enthusiast, then the NASA Mission Reports being collected by Robert Godwin and printed by Apogee Press are for you. Each book essentially consists of a number of NASA documents printed for the media that describe details of the flight (e.g., the Press Kit). Separately, the original documents contained in these books would cost hundreds of dollars. Reprints of individual press kits alone would cost as much as the price of this book. The only problem is the poor reproduction of many of the black and white figures. They were obviously scanned--and often at low resolution. The important information is still there, however, and it shouldn't detract from their value as a reference."
3,"Mostly pre-mission reports, a pity","The good point about this book is the technical detail. For example, a big cut-away diagram of the first stage rocket showing fuel delivery system and nozzles. Also, complete launch sequence. The biggest disappointment was the fact that the whole book consists of pre-mission reports, and only the very briefest post-mission report. Where are the post-mission reports? Also disappointing is the fact that one report is almost identical to another! Some of the reports were scanned in, and so contain frequent spelling errors. Overall, worth it for the detailed technical stuff."
3,"Good book, would have been better if proofread!!!","Excellent book, however it is filled with typos!!! It looks like the ""editor"" simply scanned the NASA source documents, ran an OCR program and published the book, lots of letter substitutions and mispunctuations. If you are familiar with Apollo this is just an annoyance however the uninformed will be confused at times, launch pod (vs. pad) equipment boy (vs. bay) etc.That said I'd recommend the book to the serious student of Apollo history. It's filled with lots of detail that you probably won't find anywhere else.The CD is excellent, it alone is worth the cost of the book."
3,She was the serious girl,"She was the serious one, the one with the talent, the one whom God made a little stern, with big eyes that took in all the world around her, from the tropical heat of Puerto Rico, to the cold tenements of William Carlos Williams' Paterson, where half the year she lived as though paying penance for an entire family's ambition. Is it any wonder this young girl grew up to be a poet, a novelist, and a taker of incredible artistic risks? As her talents grew, she began to think of herself as belonging, oddly, to two nations, a Northern and Southern hemisphere that corresponded to her own fluidity, her ability to change genre in the middle of a sentence.Ortiz Cofer has long been one of America's cultural heroes. Now she strips back the legends of her youth to help us see the seeds of creativity which, or so some day, we all have been born with, even when obscured by circumstance. After reading this collection, you will be moved to do some ""silent dancing"" of your own."
3,Sarah****P3-R4,"Silent Dancing is an ""partial-rememberance"" of Judith Ortiz Cofer. This ""rememberance"" is basicly her whole childhood from elementary school to high school which was spent hurtling from Puerto Rico to America and vise versa. It is a very.... different book. I had never read a ""partial rememberance"" before so, it was a new experience for me. but I didnt like it very much because I coudnt understand what was going on that well. It would have been so much easier to understand if it was a ""full rememberance"", but it was still interesting. I would recommend this book to anybody that wants to read about different cultures or a little girl struggling through her childhood years. But I dont think it was for me, because I like reading fictional books more than half-biographies."
3,VeraP3R4---- Silent Dancing???,"Silent Dancing is about a young girl as she struggles through life, constantly being moved from the U.S. to Puerto Rico, and back again. The book explains everything about her experiences from kindergarten (in Puerto Rico)to being kissed in a high school hall way (in the U.S.). Family relationships, and family love are very important. I thought that this book could have been written better. I would a prefer a developed story line or plot, rather than a collection of randomly organized memories. I would also change the title. Silent Dancing is only mentioned once in the book, and its significance is unclear. What I did like about the book is the constantly shifting focus, because I have a very short attention span. I think that people who are not interested in Puerto Rico would find it difficult to finish this book. On the other hand, Silent Dancing is a good ""summer book"" for people who are curious about the culture of others."
2,Straight From the Heart Vol.2 versus Vol.1,"I was very dissapointed and sad after watching this dvd vol.2,because of the terrible sound. How is possible to produce this dvd,after producing the very nice dvd vol.1.I felt ripped-off.Wonderful artists,but miserable background sound.Who; that gave 5 stars; maybe they are deaf or were the dvd promoters."
1,Toaster that does not toast.,"I bought this toaster a week ago, i liked it becuase it is big on the inside, so i can bake a nice piece of salmon or broil a steak, but so far i have use it for toast, but it takes forever! i think its because the heating elements are too far from the toast, and mine also the door does not close all the way. Mine have not explode yet, but i am not going to wait for it. I am going to return it Monday."
3,"It's Hard to Feel Sorry for a Rock Star, but...","With all the glitz, glamor, and fame (not to mention the mega-bucks) that go with being a rock star of Rod Stewart's standing, it's very hard to feel sorry for someone like him, but this DVD did it for me. Backed by a band one step up from the garage level, Rod kills himself trying to engage his audience, but with a very few exceptions, they just aren't there for him. It's sure not Rod's fault; he turns in a great performance all around and even has the grace to seem a bit jealous of the guy who helps him out on ""Ooh La La"", but, for the most part, all the audience returns is polite applause. This is no reason not to buy the DVD, the little heard songs make it worth it, but if you have any of the later DVDs you will be even more appreciative of Janna Jacoby, Chuck Kentis, Don Kirkpatrick, Jeff Golub, Katja Rieckermann, and Natasha Pearce."
2,"The band sucked, where was Ronni Wood just for this one?!","Rod sang well, the slow songs were excellent. but the band was worthless.and Rod had to get in his bisexual comments, he never does seem to work to dispeel the talk that has gone on for decades. Sample, he says the word sin then looks at his guitar players pants and goes those are sinful, while staring at them, oh thats means nothing? they do on a man that has been so called dogged for being a bi all these years, and then the best one was when while he was singing turned the mic backwards and acted like he was buffing it with his mouth, it goes real fast, watch.not that there is anything wrong with that, a la Jerry Seinfeld, but doing that on tv and knowing its going to be on dvd, no man, no."
4,Excellent programming techniques to write robust code,"This book contains some very good hints, tips and techniques to write robust code. In addition, the author's language is entertaining, making the book fun to read(!) On the downside, the code listings get boring; you could easily print them out yourself..."
5,A must-to-have-book for pure Windows programmers,"This book covers many aspects of Windows programming, especially low level API programming. Based on the sample code provided with the book I developed in quite a short time a tiny installer that saves me and my customers quite a lot online time: The installer is only 50KB where typical installers add around 1MB to an installation."
1,"Polar CS 600 ""cycling"" computer","What a disappointment this bicycling computer is! It's far too hard to operate (there is far to many buttons to operate to get the data one needs). As a previous reviewer mentioned, ""set up"" of this computer is a ""nightmare"". The ""Pro Trainer 5"" software included with the computer did NOT install properly on my desktop computer running Windows XP.The 2007 Polar catalog advertised that the CS 600 computer included the ""cadence"" sensor. After I purchased it, I learned from Polar's web site that what their catalog advertised wasn't true. According to them, they had made a ""mistake"" in their catalog, and their cadence sensor wasn't included in the purchase price. I contacted my local bike shop, and they made good on my deal with them.Even though they made good on the deal of the cadence sensor, it has never worked correctly. To sum it up, I haven't been the least bit impressed with ""Polar"". I'll be shopping around for another bicycle ""computer""."
3,know your background subject,"This is my first Treacher novel and as a thriller it's reasonably good. But the author has a purely superficial knowledge of the U.S.Army and it shows.General officers do not wear branch insignia.Army officers[unlike Marine officers]do not wear marksmanship badges.And the tank and cavalry branch of the Army is known as ""Armor Branch"" and not as the constantly referred to ""Armored Branch"".While these gaffes may not bother a nonveteran reader, for former armor officers they display a genuine ignorance of the Army.More significantly, the author seems to think that an Army branch controls strategy and conducts tactical operations and he has his ""Armored Branch"" doing these things when, in fact, a branch is an administrative office solely devoted to personnel issues like assignments.An author who gets all the background notes just right is Nelson DeMille in a similar background thriller,""The General's Daughter""."
2,Imagerman Review,"I read a lot of political intrigue, but this book was so amateurishly written and so disappointing. The premise is good but poorly developed and the main character is but a trite hero with superhuman abilities to ""take down"" the bad guy. I won't waste my time with any more Lee Child novels."
4,Brought tears to my eyes.....,"Always impressed by the detail and obvious research in Lee Child's novels, the section of this book about his Mother's involvement with the French underground during WW11 brought tears to my eyes. My father plane was shot down in enemy territory during the war. He was hidden out in a stone barn by the French underground along with the surviving members of his crew. His story, the peasant clothing over his uniform, the fear of being approached by the enemy during their trek to Spain, and most of all, the weeks they were hidden out in the barn, the 14 year old boy who brought them food every day. Mr. Child did his homework. I always wished my Dad's story could have been told. While reading this part of the book, it was if Lee Child had spoke with my Dad. Thank you for this. I'm hooked on the Jack Reacher series.Daughter of a hero."
5,Very Good Read!,Lee Child's Reacher series is exciting and enjoyable to read! Couldn't stop reading!! The story line is always thrilling and keeps your interest!
4,Reacher's Start,"THE ENEMY is noteworthy in that it takes the reader back to Reacher's days as a MP in the army. His brother and his mother play leading roles, and so does Reacher's distaste of authority. The pages turn quickly and Reacher has his usual body count from those who underestimate him. The ending tries to hold up a high moral line, but it actually doesn't and is the weakest part of the novel. Still, as far as pulp fiction goes, this series is about as good as it gets."
5,"Powerful book, twists, turns, treachery","Lee Child's hero/anti-hero Jack Reacher is plunged into a complex murder & coverup situation, where allies & enemies are not quite clear, and one surprise follows the next. ""The Enemy"" goes on a fast bumpy ride, from North Carolina to Paris, then back again, till clues are uncovered and justice is doled out...Reacher-style."
5,Works very nicely as a prequel,"After the previous Reacher novels which refer to his MP background, this is a very welcome look at the character in that phase of his life, and one can clearly see why he didn't remain in the service.I also liked the matter-of-fact handlng of the inter-racial relationship between Reacher and Summers."
4,A must read for Thriller fans.,"I'm a little late on my review but I just had to get a plug in for Lee Child. In my opinion Lee Child is an unsung mystery/thriller writer. His novel ""The Enemy"" is prequel to the rest of the Jack Reacher's series going back to his army days in the early 1990's.What follows is a terrific military police procedural that finds Reacher pursuing a case that involves a cover-up in the USA and Europe. This exciting story could only be told by the talents of Lee Child. A must read for all thriller fans."
2,I'm Sure His Other Books Are Better,This is the only book by this author that I have read. The first half of the book was okay. Then the author rambled here and there to fill up the pages for the second half of the book. The main character is interesting. Too bad the book isn't.
2,A little slow for a Reacher book,"I enjoyed his other books much more, but that's probably because I have less patience than most. Too much running around in circles here for me."
2,Not the best!,"Out of all the Reacher books this is the slowest and most boring. All i can say is that we are all upset to think that Tom Cruise may play the role of Reacher? I love Tom Cruise but in my mind he is just not Reacher. Good luck,"
4,Reacher Rocks,"I have read all the Reachers series and one thing I always wanted was a ""Take us back to when he was in the army"" well that's exactly what we got with The Enemy, clever the twists and turns through-out the book had me reading this book in one sitting. Great book Reacher Rocks!!"
3,Just another novel,I just love this series of books but this one was a little disappointing. It was slow moving and did not have the punch and excitement that others in the series have. Jack didn't make me feel that he was that fabulous macho 'hero'.
1,Political statements off base,"Half way reading this book, I began to understand Lee Child has some very pointed views about the American military and they are not good. I found this very ironic, especially considering that he is NOT an American; but, a British citizen, one of whom is not in favor of current American military policies. I was even more irate, when I discovered he has never served in any type of military whatsoever. He is a wannabe, and does not understand what is like to serve, have served, or see your buddy in a body bag. Therefore, I am never reading any of his books again, and suggest others read between the lines of his stories and come to your own conclusion."
2,The wrong vechicle for this yarn,"Child writes in in interesting manner and creates an appropriate amount of suspense, however, he should not have chosen the US Army for his vechicle -- because his knowledge of such is extremly superficial at best. He creatates a main character who exists in a fictictious unit in an Army of which he has no basic understanding of its mores, organization, operations, rules & regulations, nor traditions.He should have consulted a career officer before he went to press.Why I take such umbrage with this novel is that that the portrayal is such a distorted picture of how the Army operates, the uninitiated will take it is as legitimate and feel that they now know what can go on within its structure.As an aside, like Patricia Cornwell, he seems to have a homosectual acceptance agenda woven into his novel that becomes an unnecessary distraction.I certainly will not try his work again."
1,Lot's of fighting and killing....,"These are well written books; however, the amount of killing and maiming done by the main character outside of the law/as a vigilante was enough to turn me off from the series."
1,THE ENEMY,To be honest I read 15% of this 8th book & stopped. The storyline was boring & didn't hold my interest. It could have used some action.
5,Never redundent,"Lee Child is as refreshing with his 3rd, 4th, 9th, novel as he was with his very first writing. He apparently does considerable research or has one of the most expanded imaginations you can think of. Having spent considerable time in the military, I'm aware of the facts used in the novels to be rather exact. There is the opportunity for Child to slide off to the SciFi side; however, he always sticks to the ""every day"" side of the story and has the uncanny ability to leave you shaking your head at the ending of some of the chapters. Wording is one of his greatest assets, for example, and I quote from ""The Enemy"". . .""'I put the gun to my temple. He stared at me. 'Just kidding' I said. Then I shot him through the center of the forehead'"" Kind of makes you look away and wonder, how did he come up with that line. Childs' novels are full of those and other lines that make you wonder. By all means, get one and see what i'm talking about!"
4,Enjoyed another,"Finally we get to learn more about a younger Reacher and his brother and mother. This one is truly a story worthy of the twists, very surprising ending!"
4,The case that got reacher demoted,In depth look into the military politics after the fall of the Berlin wall while reacher had to stop one serious conspiracy that led to murders and ...
2,not the best moment of Lee Child,"I've read all his books and i always keep tabs with anything new that he pubishes.I consider myself a fan, however ""The enemy"" wasn't Lee Child's best moment. I was expecting for something to happen till the last page, the end was very dissapointing and it doesn't meet with the writer's standards.I guess everyone has his ups and downs, his next book was surely a big come-back so i'm not holding a grudge on the author.If i had to pick just ONE of Child's books to read, i'd certainly wouldn't pick ""The enemy""He's written a lot of much better books."
2,Reacher as Expected,"This is a typical Lee child. He has a standard formula and each book is gripping, and unputdownable. The characters are well drawn out. There is practically no sex; if there is it is cursory. Reacher is unbelievable but you want more of him. Big, strong, bright, imaginative, compassionate to the oppress3d and a vengeful tiger to the oppressors."
2,The Enemy: A Jack Reacher Novel,I have read all of Lee Child's books and am a big Jack Reacher fan. This book has way too many descriptions of which road he is going to take and directions. Who cares! It is mired in useless details of the roads. Very disappointed.
2,Not the best of the series so far,Since this is the first in the series that has delved directly into Reacher's military time it has become very obvious that the author has done very little research into actual military life. Constantly mixing up various branch terms throughout the book. Besides that it has been the hardest plot to really get excited about and I'm not as anxious to read it through as I have been with the first seven.
5,Great Book,"I chose this rating because I've yet to read a Jack Reacher I don't love.Sorry, I have no time to write reviews."
3,Good but plot gets tedious at times.,"For Jack Reacher fans as myself, helps in the development and understanding of this character. Plots becomes unnecessarily tedious at times. Overall a good read but not of the best of Reacher."
1,more on the enemy,"As a Reacher fan I was very disappointed in the Enemy.It was boring, had little action and was unrealistic in the lengths gone to by the baddies for the relatively minor gain.There was a gap waiting to be filled in the Reacher story but this didn't fill it."
2,Gets boring in the middle...,"Starts interestingly enough, but then gets boring almost till the end. Too many procedural details - I felt like I was watching a 3-hour episode of CSI, and not a good one. This was my 3rd Reacher's novel - I totally enjoyed 61 Hours and Killing Floor which were unstoppable fun, and I was completely surprised how lame The Enemy was. If I started the series with it, I would have probably ended with it. However, I know that Lee Child can do better, so I'll try a couple more novels."
2,Lazy Jack Reacher Entry,"I'm hooked on the Reacher series and have been compulsively reading them straight through. Most I have thoroughly enjoyed...but, when Child is coasting it is painfully obvious. In fact, this is the third out of eight that I've found myself continuing to read simply because I couldn't believe how awful it was and/or there was still enough of a hook in some part of the story that I wanted to find out how he would resolve. In this particular novel, he took us 80% through the novel to have Jack stumble across what anyone paying attention to the actual story....and not getting all tangled up in looking for a yogurt cup or the usual page after page of details about armaments.....knew from almost the beginning about who was doing the killing and the big secret about the first dead guy. Anyway....buyer beware.....Lee is really cheating his readers on this one and should be ashamed of himmself."
3,dissapointing,"this is one of his worst books to date. I'm used to Jack Reacher stories being exciting and fast paced and this one doesn't deliver. Some parts were seriously boring. I think more action would have improved it a great deal. Overall, just ok. Dissapointing."
5,The Enemy,"Love the Jack Reacher Series. I've read them all and pre-purchased the new one coming out today. I started reading the series in the middle and went back and read them from the beginning. I wanted to know what made him the man he is. I plan to re-read them. Jack Reacher is a very interesting, complex character who can't walk away from evil and injustice."
5,Lee Child Kills it Again,"Dude. This is Lee Child. I don't see why anyone needs to know anything else. Buy this book. Read it, then buy the next one and so on. This series is fantastic. Every one of the books is so exciting and then funny and then nerve-wracking, but never fear! Reacher will handle it! Read this book!"
5,Entertaining,"Having read all the Jack Reacher books, I can only say - Give me more! As each new book comes out, I stop what I am presently reading and read the new book. There is nothing that is as entertaining and you always want to know how the story will end. Keep 'em coming, Lee Child, please."
5,The BEST of the series,"If you have read the other Jack Reacher novels, you wont be disappointed with this one.IF you are new to the series, READ THIS FIRST! I didnt (read the Persuader first) and wish I had read it first. It gives great insight into Jack and his relationships with his brother and mother..THis is the best of the series! I rarely re-read books but since I am inpatient waiting for the next JR novel, I will re-read this one. (Gone Tomorrow was a disappointment for me)Read this book.. its interesting, a thriller, a page turner and not obvious bad buys."
5,Exciting Story,"Lee Child is a ""Master"" at Mystery & Suspense. Have read almost all of his Jack Reacher books. Every one of them are excellent. Enjoyed this book very much.PMA"
4,The Enemy,I have finished the first eight in this series and can't wait for number nine. Keep up the good work
4,Another great Lee Child's book!,I enjoyed reading the book that explained Reacher's reduction of rank. Some of the army talk was over my head.
4,A great recommendation from a friend,"Bought this book on a recommendation to try the series. Well written and paced, it kept me interested in what came next from cover to cover. Good characters and plot developed naturally with few forced twists and turns. A great vacation book!"
4,The Enemy (Jack Reacher) - Lee Child,"Yet another enjoyable Jack Reacher novel – a little different this time as it is a prequel, which gives background of his Army career and his relationships with his brother and mother.Mr Child must carry out an enormous amount of research as his descriptions of weapons and army equipment are very detailed. However, I find this enhances the story even though I am not a mechanically or technically minded person. I find it instructive.It is interesting that the first few novels were written in the third person, but the most recent ones are in the first person. I enjoy both."
4,"Gotta admit Jack is good always provides us with a satisfiying finish, Child comes up with some good twisty plots to keep susp",I like the Child plots and way with words to keep one staying up reading through the night. We all need a Jack Reacher in our lives.
2,Military Malfunction,"I like Jack Reacher, but not when he is in the army chasing the murder of a two star general with staff working against him, he going AWOL facing court martial. For the female readers like me the entrenched reading of army details gets very tiresome, and on many pages I find myself bored. What is the twentieth century's signature sound? Lee Child asks. I know the answer, because I was a child in WWii Germany, it's definitely the slow drone of an aero engine in the sky. No, he says, it's the squeal and clatter of tanks tracking on pavements. Not to my knowledge, but what do I know about military life? The language is good but the endless attempts to ferret out who swung the custom made crow bar and why? I am on page 317 now and still clueless. 76 pages more to go in a malfunctioning military environment."
1,huge miscalculation,"Despite being a Brit, Lee Child has created a quintessential American hero in Jack Reacher, in the Mike Hammer class, if not Marlowe or McGee. Somtimes he gets details wrong that no American male would make (in his latest, ""One Shot"" a far superior book to this one, he refers to ""striped umpire uniforms"" rather than referee).However, the whole premise of this book is so wrong. (SPOILER ALERT!!!!!) the idea that American generals would be killing each other off because there are fewer spots to be promoted to during military downsizing, is ludicrous. Maybe in 19th Century Russia, or Saddam's Iraq, or even Pakistan, but it's silly in the extreme. Too bad."
2,Lee Child you blew it on this one!!!,I have never been so bored in my life. I have read all the previous Reacher books and loved them. This one is sooooo boring. I cannot even finish the book.
5,Fun Read,"""The Enemy"" is great read. I love Lee Child's Reacher series. This one is no exception. Wish he could write as fast as I read."
4,The Enemy,"I love this character that Lee Child has created. I can relate to his free spirit and I just love a man who can take charge in a trying situation. He may not have money, but he has a distinct sense of fairness."
4,Return to Form,"This was the 11th Reacher book I have read, and although I have not been reading them in order, I did prefer this to some of the more recent Books such as ""A Wanted Man"".As a huge Reacher fan I always prefer the books where we find out more information about his time in the Army and previous relationships. There are two things which make this book important to the Reacher legacy, the time he spends with his brother and mother and the career decision he makes at the end.The time spent with Joe, magnifies the differences in their personality and allowed me to better understand the comments he makes in previous books regarding their relationship. The book also introduces his mother and gives further insight to Reachers childhood, for me the best part was finding out that his mother always referred to him as 'Reacher'.Regarding the Career choice ill let you find that out for yourself!"
5,Fantastic Read,"Lee Child gets the facts right and the details are in order. Lots of surprises, some things are predictable, but all in all great book."
3,The Enemy,The EnemyVery good read but a little far-fetched-people who plan grand conspiracies would know better than to write it all down-i think Child has the same hard-on for the military that Brown has for the Catholic church.
4,Jack the MP,This book gives us a little insight into Jack`s relationship with his brother and mother while an MP Major. A good read.
4,I'm a Fan,Lee Child writes with the same format in all his books. But I am a huge fan. I've read all his books. I am ready for the next one.
4,"Well Done, Well Thought",The plot was interesting.The caracter of Jack Reacher preserves most psychological treats of common human beings without jeopardizing the individuality of the character. Reacher is an attractive fellow.Based on this book I went on a shopping spree for Lee Child books and picked up Die Trying and The Hard Way and my disappointment ruled out any further attempt.I wonder:Was it the same writer?Did the publishers rushed him up?
4,INTERESTING READ,Purchased two of this authors books at once and had never read him before. I shall certainly add him to my reading list.
2,Exciting but absolutely absurd,"Invincible Jack Reacher. Mr. Child why not use your incredible writing tallent for good instead of absurdity. I have read all of the Jack Reacher novels to date. Each time I get to the end I feel cheated. Too much doesn't make sense. I am not an expert on the armed forces but this is just too out there to make any sense at all (even before 9/11). But, they are good reading."
3,Jack Reacher Rocks-The Plot Sucks,"Jack Reacher is super cool and that's a fact. But the plot of this novel reeks. Gays in Delta Force? That's a tough sell. Yes, there are gays in the military, and they do a great job, but in Delta Force? I don't buy it. And Armor officers murdering people to ensure the future of Abrams tanks. Nope... that's plain silly and stupid. Come on Lee! Give us Reacher, but in a plot that's semi-believable."
2,Gets really boring,Started off fine as a typical Reacher Story with the added interest of Reacher's Brother and Mother being in it because of the flashback thing. Then it got really boring and I found myself picking up something else to read instead. Should be about half as long since there are about 250 pages of nothing happening.
3,SUPERMAN LIVES!!!!!!,"Trying to ignore the glaring mistakes of our military in all Lee Child's adventure stories, I have read every one of them and enjoyed them all. Being British, Lee prefers writing/criticizing U.S. military but that's OK and I can forgive the booboo's because the story is quick moving and he paints Reacher as quite a hunk! He's invincible and heals quickly! :DThis prequel explains a lot about Reacher's motives and background. His family situation is so sad! And Joe, his brother, is somewhere deep in the Killing Floor.If you take this book as gospel, you will be disappointed. Just be glad you can recognize the miliary errors and just enjoy it as a good exciting read."
3,A Not Very thrilling Thriller!,"Overall, The Enemy is a moderately entertaining book, but one I found myself being able to put down easily and not feel the urge to rush back to. The basic plot of a General being found dead at an unexpected site and Jack Reacher's investigation of it starts off exciting and makes for very fast reading. However, for about the next two-thirds of the book, it dragged on for very long passages of time without providing much in the way of thrills and excitement. It became overly methodolical and plodding. Jack Reacher, who is always an interesting character, continues to be so in The Enemy, but to a lesser extent than in previous books. While the ending picked up in terms of excitement and suspense, it was too little too late for me. The Enemy, if you decide to read it, is a book to take from the library or wait to buy in paperback. It is a book that I think you'll find satisfactory, but is not one that I'd recommend you put high up on your ""to be read"" list."
4,La Traviata - Sutherland/Pavarotti Highlights,"Though a tad dated, this is Verdi given the five-star treatment at the hands of two masters."
1,"Never received pens, that I was charged for","I have never received the pens I ordered from Amazon, and my credit card was charged for them. I will never use Amazon again."
2,"Solid,but not a guitar drven effort","Let me begin by saying that Teresa Russell has a good voice and the song writing was very solid.Yet,I bought this cd because of the guitar talents of Teresa Russell and found few examples of her potential for greatness here.Most of these songs clock in around 6 minutes or better and mostly this time is used in vocals with very few guitar solo's.If you are seeking a guitar driven album featuring an extremely talented Lady guitarist,rhen this one is not for you."
5,Wow! One of the best romantic fantasy books I've read!,"What can I say except - Wow! It is one of the best romantic fantasy books I've read in years... The hero, Torcuil cuts a dashing figure and he has a big unselfish heart too! Yeah, not to mention softhearted and gentle too! (Most heroes in such gothic romances appear like male chauvenistic pigs...if you know what I mean!). The heroine meanwhile, is strong, rich and appears selfless... Such characters - where to find these days??! Anyway, the storyline has some poignant moments too but the ending is just perfect... Most fantasy books I've read really tests one's intelligence. I'm glad in this respect, this author comes up with quite credible fantasy characters. Keep up the good work, Madam!"
5,I just love books with the paranormal,This book is great for those of you like myself who enjoy books about the paranormal. It keeps in suspense about just what he is? Buy this book and enjoy.
1,Not that great,"The handle part of the tennis racquet lifted up and caught on everything! It finally broke off, now it looks stupid."
3,Self asserted Dummy,"I'm glad to see that so many people do not mind applying the term ""dummy"" to themselves when it comes to trying new things. Even though the black and yellow cover clashes horribly with my copies of Emmerson and Tennyson on the bookshelf, I am not ashamed. I would hope that the self-professed ""snob"" who wrote one off these reviews has the sense not only to use his large vocabulary with caution, but also to spell ""label"" properly when communicating how snobbish s/he is."
5,Fabulous,"This is just the third opera I've owned and I LOVE it. Seriously, it is beautiful. I listen to it at the YMCA while walking on the treadmill - and the time flies by. I even manage to follow the libretto during slower moments. Even if you're a newbie like me, buy this opera."
3,Le Nozze di Figaro,"Save your money! In theory this should be an excellent recording. There is no better Countess alive today than Kiri te Kanawa. Samual Ramey, Thomas Allen, Lucia Popp and Frederica von Stade SHOULD round out what would be a to-die-for cast. Too bad then that this is a completely lifeless performance of Mozart's best. Even Solti's excellent conducting can't salvage it. If you want to find an excellent recording of ""Figaro"" you can't beat the cast of Dawn Upshaw, Thomas Hampson, Te Kanawa, Anne-Sophie van Otter and the late Tatiana Troyanos, conducted by James Levine of the Metropolitan Opera."
3,excellent singers but .......,"same thing is applicable to Solti and Giulini's Mozart. there is not doubt that excellent work was done by excellent singers. give your two thumbs up to producers but not to conductors. it's a common mistake. solti is a good conductor but terrible one to play Mozart. he is just a bang-bang guy. he is unbelievably overvalued in the US. if Solti can do it, you can do it."
4,I liked...,"...all the music that was in the Matrix movies. I downloaded all the music at Amazon, and what wasn't available for download I bought the CDs..."
3,"Excellent music, but I agree that it's much too short.","I highly enjoyed this soundtrack but I too wish it contained more music on it, especially considering the price tag. As far as movie scores go, my favorites are still Graeme Revell's Crow albums, which just astonish me. By the way, what is the name of the Enigma song played over the Matrix TV ads?"
3,Intense but way too short.,"If you are a BIG Matrix fan, you will most likely enjoy the score. It is intense and stimulating, but sadly, much too short. This release appears to be a quicky put out because of demand, and hopefully something more substantial will be eventually issued."
4,short!,"Great movie, great soundtrack, and great score - too bad this album is only 30 minutes long! A little overpriced for the amount of music."
2,"Good, but hardly any music...","I find it hard to believe that many of the tracks on the CD are shorter, or different from the ones in the movie. And that there are only about 35 minutes of music on the CD. And the fact that not all of the best music from the score is included, such as the ethnic percussion intro to the karate training scene. However, what little music is included on this CD is good, but if you really liked the music, the best thing to do would be to get the DVD and record from the music only track available in the bonus features."
3,Short and sweet - but missing specifics,"I'd buy if it was longer. I'd buy it if it had the music from the scene were Neo and Morpheus fight - part of that music is on the soundtrack, but its missing the most exciting part of the scene.The soundtrack is fun, and the score is nice. This is a nice little representation of the score that brings the movie feel to you. Its enjoyable, yet not quite the bang that I was looking for."
5,Music that pictures,The tracks on this album are treading and depicturing the movie to such an extent that it enables you to actually see and live the scenes from the Matrix getting a better and deeper understanding of the ideas and problems that this movie poses.Inspirational
4,It'll Cleanse Your STAR WARS Listenin' Palate,"More of a sound-world than a tune-filled score, the soundtrack pulses and swarms like a living character. And a not always nice character! It's a real departure for fans of STAR WARS who might want a cheery march. This score is a layer of ambience for a twisted, busy metropolis that has folded in on itself. Aw heck, just take a listen to the samples.There are a number of people complaining about the half-hour length and the fact that Varese did not spend the money to put more music on the CD. Heaven knows if there will ever be a more extensive CD, but one can listen to an isolated score (with the composer talking between tracks about how he scored the movie) in THE MATRIX DVD.Considering the brazen marketing of this movie (One of the Oscar winners yelled out from the Academy Awards podium to check THE MATRIX Web site), one lives in hope that along with THE MATRIX 2 and THE MATRIX 3, a complete CD of the score will appear."
1,Wasn't too good,It wasn't good at all to me. I bought the wrong C.D. and got the Original Motion Picture instead of the Motion Picture and the entire C.D. sounds like the X-Files theme song. It was kinda wierd to me. Unless you need that kind of music for something i wouldn't reccomend it at all.
1,Not very good,This C.D. was pretty bad. All the songs sounded like the X-Files theme song. Unless you need to use that kind of music for something I would not reccomend it.
1,Matrix original soundtrack,is it different from the other Matrix soundtrack explicit lyrics? if so how much?
3,"It gets better after a while, but still not that great","OK. I was extremely disappointed at this score at first, but as I listined to it, it got better, but still, the music was slow and repetative, and only a few tunes at the beginning and on power plant actually clicked. there was hardly enough good action music worth listining to. some of the instruments sounded blaring and din't sound good. It composers like trevor rabin that can use the instruments so they sound more like music, rather that instruments being played abrubtly and unevenly. Not too bad, but still, if you want blanching, relentlessly inspiring action and orchestra music, pick up DEEP BLUE SEA by Trevor Rabin or SPEED by Mark Manciana"
3,"Well, it's cool. Partially.","This Don Davis score is not really a blown opportunity in my humble opinion, but indeed it is a bit messy.Don Davis has chosen an atonal approach with fluctuating volumes and busy motives underlining the orchestral pulsating. The atonal cues resemble Davis' work on ""House on Haunted Hill"" (which I prefer).If only he had spent a bit more score time on tonal action, I think the soundtrack could have been better.The first, the last and the ""Hotel Ambush"" cues stand out.This album is worth picking up if you are a score fan and if it is not too pricy.If you are a huge fan of tonal orchestral scores, this album is not recommended.This Matrix certainly is not a Jacobian."
5,A great score,"What a great score! Don Davis proves that he is definitely one of the top composers in todays films. I appreciate that this score wasn't horribly long, like some scores I can think of, and that it didn't cut out a lot of tracks. My only gripe is that it should have been put with ""The Matrix"" album to create a 2 disc purchase, like ""Reloaded."""
5,I LOVE the MOVIE and most of all I love the soundtrack score,I love the movie so much that I saw it 10 times in california and once while on vaction. I have bought the cd with the lyrics on it and I'm about to buy the matrix soundtrack score. I can't wait till the second one comes out and all I have to say is that Keanu Reeves better not pass this sequel up.
1,30 minutes not worth the money,"I was anticipating the score soundtrack to be released for ""The Matrix"" for quite a while after seeing the movie. I wasn't interested in listening to Marilyn Manson and the like, so I figured the score would be a better bet.Until I bought it.The CD contains a hair over 30 minutes of score material. What kind of joke is this? Heck, couldn't they have _made up_ another 15 minutes or so of music, just to make the purchase worthwhile?It's not that the music is bad, per se. But it's ... unexhilarating, unlike the music during the movie. So, avoid this unless you find it at a used store. Which is where you might find my copy."
3,THIS CD KICKS FOR WHAT'S THERE,"This score is awesome, and it totally sets the mood of the film. To answer an earlier question, on the music commentary on the Matrix dvd, Don Davis called the track ""EXIT MR. HAT"" because it's an anagram of ""THE MATRIX."" Anywho, this score is quite dark, and has a kind of thing going where the music echoes and sounds pretty bizarre, but cool. The only reason this cd isn't perfect is that there are too few tracks. I also have to recommend the Matrix Reloaded soundtrack, which totally owns this cd. I suggest buying both."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CD!,I wasn't expecting much but this score kinda sucks. I can't beleive itgot nominated for best original score from the Academy Awards this year. The score to the Matrix is just like a new X-Files episode that hasn't been on FOX yet. I can't beleive I wasted my money on this CD. When the Matrix soundtracks came out I was expecting it to be the score and soundtrack on one CD but it's just a rip off on how they do that seperately. I hope that the soundtrack will be better than the score. The score wasn't very good.
4,A great effort by Don Davis,"Hmm...where do I start off? This is a great achievement by Don Davis and it perfectly conveys every scene in the movie. Unfortunately, the Varese Sarabande business men who put this together left out the Lobby Scene music, the Kung Fu scene, and the two or three scenes before ""The Power Plant"", when the group picks up Neo, among other pieces. Fortunately, a few die-hards on the internet have extracted these among other tracks not found on this disc, and the files can be found on file-sharing programs. However, this CD still gives the listener a great and profound experience, without the extra tracks. Theme-lovers(John Williams fans- you know who you are) maybe a bit disappointed, but then again if you listen a little closer, you'll hear thematic ideas, but not full-fledged themes. I myself am a John Williams fan, but this is new, refreshing...Williams himself reccomended that Don Davis do Jurassic Park 3, and he did. All in all, a great score, and a sure-fire buy."
4,A mind-bending musical odyssey,"""The Matrix: Original Motion Picture Score"" represents composer/conductor Don Davis' contributions to the Wachowski Brothers' spectacular science fiction film. While Davis' score does not have the variety and depth of some of the classic genre film scores of the 1990s, this is still an excellent example of film music.The music is the perfect complement to the bizarre odyssey of Neo, the character portrayed by Keanu Reeves. The score makes good use of an eerie human chorus on track 3, ""The Power Plant,"" and the fine work of boy soprano Theo Lebow adds a haunting quality to track 4, ""Welcome to the Real World."" Throughout the disc composer Davis conducts his orchestra with passionate intensity. The end result is music that is often otherworldly, and frequently pulse-quickening. If you loved the movie, or if you are interested in the art of film scoring, check out this disc."
2,"Great Moments, But Simply Too Short","The Matrix was backed by an excellent soundtrack, and a mostly excellent score. In order to fully enjoy the score, you must be watching the movie. The score isn't very good as a stand-alone product. However, it does have it's great moments in the beginning, but I disliked the fact those moments weren't repeated very much. It seems this was too short to accompany a 2 hour+ movie, but repeating it a lot did. It's too bad they couldn't at least repeat more on this CD. I bought this searching for the upbeat fighting music, which I now find is on The Matrix soundtrack. While I haven't bought it yet, I highly recommend the soundtrack for the instrumental songs (Spybreak!, for one). But I really don't think this CD is worth the money."
5,The perfect music for a perfect movie,"The Matrix is a movie that makes you think that your confortable reality you are living in is not so sure as you thought. It is very cold because the ideas that you find in it are also cold. The music should represent and help the movie expres what it has to say. The score is cold, very cold, makes you be scared and unsure about what comes next. And if you want to know how it it to be completly alone on this planet, listen to ""The Power Plant"". You'll be in a new world you don't know anything about it. In fact what do you know about this world?"
2,Teleurstellend,"Op de website van FatCat Records wordt de band aangeprezen als dynamisch en vernieuwend. Na beluistering van de CD kom ik echter tot een andere conclusie. De nummers neigen naar saaiheid, de dynamiek kan ik niet vinden en vernieuwend durf ik het ook niet te noemen. Het lijkt een beetje op oude wijn in nieuwe zakken. De band is van plan om in de toekomst meer op te gaan treden en dan vooral op het Europese vasteland. Misschien dat de band live beter tot zijn recht komt maar op basis van deze CD denk ik niet dat ik vooraan sta."
4,I like the author's penchant for detail.,"Finally! A mystery that offers fine-hewn details, setting an ambience without getting too carried away or too cute. The characters are defined with a light touch, too. I'm a writer, too, and I know discipline when I see it - Michelle Spring writes with restraint, all the while crafting a believable and captivating mystery. I liked this book so much - and I have read a lot of mysteries - that I bought Spring's Nights in White Satin before I'd even finished the first Laura Principal mystery. This is one likable investigator."
2,Very disapointed,"I have the large and small batter bowls. Everyone seemed to rave over them. First off, I can not get a nice clean pour from them without making a mess. So I figure they are just for storing 'batter' in them. The lids are of poor quality. They don't seal well. I have other pampered chef items. I wish I would have never spent the money. I just feel they are made of poor quality for the money."
2,Loved this bowl until it shattered,"I have used this bowl for years and have loved it, until it shattered unexpectedly. I had a batch of cooked, cooled chicken in it (it was full of the chicken). The chicken had been cooked and cooled the day before, then put in the bowl where it sat in the fridge overnight. Then next morning I brought it out and put it in a laundry basket for transport. My mother picked it up by the ill-fitting lid (yep - doesn't fit very well) and it immediately dropped and shattered. I want to point out that it dropped maybe 6 inches into a plastic laundry basket, and shattered. I can see this happening if it dropped from counter height, but that wasn't the case."
2,Blown bearing!,"After about 2 years of LIGHT use, the front bearing on the motor blew its seals and all the balls, too! :-( Can't seem to find a replacement bearing, either.Until then, it was great for small jobs and light weight. Held accuracy very well. Easy to use. The electric brake was very fast and a nice safety feature."
5,Splendid!,"This is the first recording of ""Lucia di Lammermoor"" that I've ever bought, and I do believe that this is going to be the last the I've ever bought. It's an almost perfect recording, with a clever conductor and a spectacular cast of singers. Joan Sutherland and Luciano Pavarotti sound amazing when they sing their parts; the ""Mad Scene"" in particular is spine-tingling. The supporting cast (Sherrill Milnes, Nicolai Ghiaurov, Huguette Tourangeau) make it all the more complete. I did have a problem with the recording's ""sound effects""; it's kind of distracting once you get into this studio recording. But SFX aside, this is one of the greatest acheivements in opera CD history. I highly recommend it to opera beginners, and to those who don't even like Donizetti.Grade: A"
5,Very nice!!!,"I originally bought the awful Callas version, then got this one. Very nice indeed. I think that Joan Sutherland's singing is miraculous here, like a violin. I only wish I had heard her LIVE, but I'm too young. I also like Luciano Pavorotti, so nice voice. This is my favorite recording of over 20 I bought recently."
3,I guess I just don't like the style,"The music is too flowery. I like the jarring sounds of Britten or Weill instead. The performances are technically superior on this recording, however. Sutherland has such command of each note. I have not studied the score but I imagine not one is missing. Anyway, the music's beautiful, just not my taste."
5,Opera major at UCLA's favorite Lucia,"I understand the art of beautiful singing, bel canto. Joan Sutherland takes it the new heights and dimensions.This is one flawless performance that will never be equal in our generation. I have it and it is without question killer!Pavarotti is almost as good. But the star is Dame Joan.The most difinitive Lucia ever. Callas is also good. But the singing of Joan Sutherland is heavenly.PRobably the greatest bel canto recording ever made. I know that's saying a lot. But as a music major I've heard them all. and this one in incomparable."
2,Too slow a pace,"I bought this CD based on the reviews at Amazon. I have to say I'm very disappointed. While the singing is indeed excellent, the director's pace is, overall, too slow, and much of the sparkle that Donizetti should normally have is missing. I blame Bonynge."
4,What I expected.,This is better quality than most martial arts videos. The guy at least knows what he is doing and he teaches a good form. It would be more convenient on dvd.
2,Lifetime TV Movie In Print,"I picked up this book on the recommendation of a friend that described it as ""reading like a poem.""While the language and flow of the book were easy to follow and smooth, the plot was extremely weak.The whole thing reads like a Lifetime Movie and has all the hallmarks of such a movie:Troubled girl leaves schoolSmall-town murder/suicide leaves orphaned childrenLonely pastorLonely pastor spars with troubled girl over care of orphaned childrenLonely pastor and troubled girl are left as guardians of orphaned children, fall in love, get married, raise orphaned children.Sadly it has turned me off of Kimmel. I won't be reading anything else by her."
2,Horribly Self-Indulgent for Author,"I wholeheartedly agree with the negative reviews of this book. The strange and unrealistic dialogue, the whiny and tiresome temper tantrums of the main character, the completely unsympathetic nature of ALL the characters made for a very tedious read. I read up until 20 pages or so from the end and then just skimmed to finish it. I can't believe someone actually recommended this book to me as a contemporary romance! There's no romance in this book whatsoever! There's just the self-indulgent ramblings on the part of the author about philosophy, religion and literature, some weak plot, and a lot of feeling sorry for oneself. The ramblings add zero to the plot or character development. They're boring. The book was a waste of my time. I'm donating it to the library today for some other schmuck to get suckered in.I have to admit I'm an extremely picky reader. My favorite author currently is Jonathan Franzen. Now THAT author's work is pure genius!"
3,THE SOLACE OF LEAVING EARLY - A NOVEL,"While this book was certainly not a ""page turner,"" it was interesting enough. I have considered re-reading it to see if I missed something!"
1,The solace of being able to stop reading this book early,"I just passed the halfway mark on this one, and I've decided that I've closed the cover for the final time. I really don't like giving up on books, but I just can't put myself through this one any longer. It is so disappointing because there is a really good story hidden amongst the philisophical ramblings, religious references, pretentious characters and unbelievable conversations. But I simply cannot bear witness to another one of Langston's temper tantrums or Amos' inability to write a sermon (isn't that what ministers do?) I just cannot relate to any of the characters, and I feel more irritation towards them than anything else. Several of Kimmel's other books look interesting, so I won't write her off yet. However, this one's going back to the library today."
2,"Go back to the drawing board, Ms. Kimmel!","This book is in such stark contrast to Haven Kimmel's delightful novel ""A Girl Named Zippy"" that I am finding it a chore to get through it. I am still not through it, but I think that I may have to say enough is enough and move on to a more rewarding piece of literature. I loved ""A Girl Named Zippy"" - the simplicity, the elegance of the sparseness of her words, Ms. Kimmel's humorous recollections of her childhood and life in a small town. This novel also takes place in a small town, but it's as if Ms. Kimmel is saying ""I'm grown up now, so my first novel will be in a grown-up style"" with lots of references to philosophers, religion, heavy literature, etc. Please Ms. Kimmel, go back to your roots and draw from what works for you - understatement."
2,Pretentious and Intrusive,"Some books' writing flows effortlessly into your mind. This book's writing is intrusive - I find myself thinking more about the writing style and what I don't like about it, than I do about the characters and the plot. Never a good sign. The author seems to be reaching (too hard) for the kind of lyrical and haunting prose that a few other writers have acheived.The author's depiction of the relationship between the main character and her mother is overwrought and contrived.If you want a really good book, try ""Fall on Your Knees"" by Ann-Marie MacDonald!"
2,HYPE,"Please note some great opera tenors as follows:Björling (God's gift to singing), Gigli, De Stefano, Gedda, Caruso, Pavarotti, Domingo, Corelli (HE did NOT need microphones...), Bergonzi, Martinelli, Wunderlich, Simeneau, Monaco, Volpi...Just wanted to give them some attention before they drown in the tidal wave hype called Bocelli."
1,What?,"This cd is a complete disappointment. Talk about hype! I though that Pavorotti had his adoring fans, but this is rediculous. If you want to listen to pop, perhaps Bocelli will do. But, please, not Opera. The young Pavorotti is still the best tenor today."
4,My heart would not stop pumping...,"...for the attractiveness of this really handsome hunk. (Yet he's only a person.) Sure, I like opera, but not to a great extent. As a 16-year-old teenage girl ""in love"" with a 41-year-old Italian tenor who's unfortunately married, you might say that's a big first. Viaggio Italiano (Italian Journey) is an overall interesting look at the music of Italian emigration in the world. Okay, Andrea's just a mortal. His Romanza, like I recently said, was by far the best of his recordings. When will his new one come out? Dios sabe."
1,Inadequate voice for the repertoire,"This is worse than Romanza for the reason that Bocelli's voice simply doesn't have the amplitude, sheen, sap and quality for many of the songs in this album, in particular those operatic arias, and I consider anything drummed up in the studio to be fake. The effect is not dissimilar to a pop singer attempting to sing opera, even though Bocelli's voice is much better schooled than most pop singers. Nevertheless, it's a disappointing album and I hope that Bocelli can be wise enough to refrain from tackling music which he just can't cope."
1,THE PITS,"Andrea Bocelli cannot sing opera, with or without a mike. While more bearable than Michael Bolton or Sara Brightman, Bocelli simply does not have the voice to sing opera. He should stick to singing sirupy love ballads, and leave the opera to the pros. I have lost all respect for Denyce Graves when I heard she will disgrace herself to join him in Michigan Opera Theater's Werther..."
5,Andrea Bocelli at his best!,"I have almost all of his cds, and they are all wonderful. This collection is more of his opera collection as opposed to his other cds. It is absolutely mezmerizing. This is Andrea at his best --it will give you goosebumps!"
4,I wasn't sure that Bocelli would be able to sing opera....,But boy was I mistaken! I was under the mistaken impression that because his pop voice was quiet and subtle at times that he would not be able to portray the strength needed to sing a good aria. I had the surprise of my life when I heard him sing Nessum Dorma which is the song by which I rate any good tenor. I had to keep myself from swooning and my friend got chills. We both agreed that this is one of the best renditions of this aria that we had ever heard. I heard the same passion throughout the rest of the album as well.
5,Stunning Vocals with Passion,Andrea Bochelli is simply one of the greatest voices that has ever been recorded. I had the pleasure of seeing him at the Molson Ampitheater in Toronto over the summer and I was blown away. I comented at the time because of the power of his voice people in Buffalo were wondering what was up on this side of the lake. His Vocal range is exceptional and it realy dose not matter if you understand Italian Just listen and enjoy
3,Good but not Sacred Arias,"This was the second Andrea Bocelli CD released in America, and the third one I bought. The selection of material here is true to the album's title, exactly the kind of material Andrea's been singing on his most recent American tour, the music of his heart. I only gave it three stars because Bocelli's magnificent as a singer and he's my hero, but some of the songs just don't cut the mustard as do the more famous ones like ""Nessun Dorma,"" ""La Donna è Mobile"" and ""O Sole Mio."" And the MRSO doesn't do as bad a job playing these pieces as the Editorial Review noted. Still, I'm not hefty enough to say that Andrea is THE BEST PERFORMER in opera, as he works himself out too hard in opera but not in pop. ""Sacred Arias,"" a classical album at heart, does my Bocelli more justice than this one. Buy that one and his ""Romanza"" and maybe ""Sogno"" CDs as well (if you haven't already), save this one for the true Bocelli fans. There's plenty more out there than this."
4,A disillusioned a-ha,"""Angel In The Snow"" a song originally written and performed by Pal for his wife at their wedding is a heart warming, emotional testimony. ""Dark Is Night For All"" is also a beautiful number with Mortens vocals hitting the mark. ""Cold As Stone"" is highly ambitious and reminiscent of ""I've Been Losing You"" from their album ""Scoundrel Days"". a-ha's previous album ""East Of The Sun/West Of The Moon"" was the most consistent, with them performing at their best but unfortunately was poorly recieved by the fans. ""Memorial Beach"" is the reflection of the disillusionment a-ha were experiencing and seperated to pursue individual projects after this album."
5,"A-ha, the best!",A-ha is the best group from the 80's. I hope some day they can be recognized for that.A-ha 4ever!
4,A decent album,"This is certainly the most underrated A-HA record. This is partly because most of A-ha's pop fans probably weren't prepared for this type of music. And mainstream rockers always considered A-ha to be a teen-pop band. Personally LIE DOWN IN DARKNESS, HOW SWEET IT WAS, COLD AS A STONE, ANGEL IN SNOW, LOCUST are my favourites. This would have definitely done better with strong promotion efforts and concerts. A good buy for rock fans. A must for serious A-Ha fans esp. those that like EAST?WEST.(I am 25 )"
5,Even my husband liked it!,"My husband (your basic Van Halen/Dwight Yoakam fan) usually breaks into a bad falsetto imitation when I listen to A-ha, but even he had to admit that this is a pretty rockin' CD, despite the singer's actual ability to sing. A-ha truly seems to be getting better over time, unlike other 80's bands that just linger on painfully. This might be their best album yet!"
3,Nowhere near horrible. Nowhere near close to their really good stuff either.,"A-Ha's ""Memorial Beach"" just isn't up to snuff. Singer Harket could elevate anything, like funeral dirge laments, and make it sound good so it's simply hard to go wrong with these guys but this effort falls largely flat because of the slightly dischordant tuning in some of the songs and simply not playing to their strengths in enough of the others. The overly long ""Cold As Stone"" goes nowhere and most of the other songs are just background music. The songs that hit closest to what A-Ha is capable of (in tone, nuance, wistfulness, and even a vague menace) are the bluesy ""Move To Memphis"", the alt-rocker ""Lie Down In Darkness"", and the lyrically strong ""Lamb To the Slaughter"". If you're new to A-Ha don't start here. If they had started here there may not have been a second album."
4,Not washed up on shore,"This came at a time when grunge kept most '80s names from reaching the US charts, and the band were falling apart. Some songs, they're not trying hard as they should, and the lyrics can be redundant and lazy. After performing at the Paralympics and Olympics, a-ha wound up taking almost the rest of the century off tending to solo projects and the like.I found the tape in the budget section once, showing they weren't gonna make it here again."
2,NOT A-ha!!!!,"I've really tried to enjoy this album because I love A-ha but I just can't.It really is depressingly poor by their standards,an LP full of bland songs - most notably Move to Memphis - that fails to excite.If I wanted to listen to adult rock I'd try Tom Petty,not this.A-ha should stick to what they're best at and not ruin themselves with fodder such as this.The album that followed this,Minor Earth Major Sky is much,much better and a return to form.That's basically a chill-out album for Sunday afternoons but has its place in any record collection.Ditch this and buy that instead."
5,Track listing:,"K-Tel 1990.1. Gimme Gimme Good Lovin' - Crazy Elephant2. The Five Americans - Western Union3. Come on Down To My Boat - Every Mothers' Son4. Tracy - The Cuff Links5.

2,I am on the fence.,"This is my first flat screen TV/monitor. I use it mainly for television viewing and have owned it for almost two months. The price is right, comparatively speaking. The weight and footprint is good. Getting the plugs in for initial set-up is an adventure because of the location of the connections.The picture is not always sharp and the speakers on my unit give out often. The sound either gets ""tinny"" or fades out. Worse yet, the remote stops working during the course of using it and to add insult to injury, the only way to turn off the unit is to unplug it. This is infuriating because it happens every day that I use it (this is not my main t.v. so I have other options.) Still it was hard for me to beat the price."
2,Picture is great. Sound isn't,"Like the previous reviewers, I had problems with sound and freezing of monitor. My remedy is to use external sound system. Since I have connected VCR/DVD and cable box to my stereo, I no longer use the monitor for audio. I also use my cable box to change channels, so I don't use the remote either except for turning monitor on and off. Another suggestion is not to use wireless network with this monitor or near it. The problem with monitor started when I was using my laptop on wireless network and the monitor froze and I could not turn it off without unplugging it. Because this monitor is designed to be used with a pc, it seems strange that it won't work with a wireless network."
1,Cyberhome monitor is NO good,I received this monitor as a christmas gift and after using it for a few weeks it does not work any more. Their is a smell which I believe indicates something internally has fried. Their is no manufacturers warranty and no where to send it to and amazon is not helpful at all. It's a piece of garbage.
1,A Waste of Paper,"This book was one of the worst I have ever read! First of all the child needs to go back to school because the grammer was horrible! Every other word was das, dat, den! I mean come on now just because it's an urban book does not mean that the author could have spoken better English. The main character Kira, was just stupid. Her and her husband were both just immature and young acting. The book really didn't go any where, so save your money and get it from the library if you must read it!"
5,You Go Girl!!!!!,Great Book!!! I would not have put up with all of that crap! I highly recommend it as a Great Read!!!
1,SMH,"This was the first book I have read by Ms. Swinson and I was thoroughly disappointed, it seemed as if the story dragged on I literally had to force myself to read it, when I was finally done I gave it to a friend and thats saying a lot, because being an avid reader I NEVER give my books away. But with this one right here..... I was glad to get it off my hands. If you really must read it try borrowing it from a friend or check it out from the library."
5,Good read from beginning to end,This was the beginning and boy was it a goody. The wifey series is always a page turners. I go through these books fast. Some of this stuff is out of this world.
2,Not good,"This book was just not good. I know it was written a while ago and KiKi's writing has improved tremendously since then but this storyline was just so bland. I love a good street book, but this one just failed to deliver. The foundation was there to go into detail about Ricky's drug business but it was just never done. All we got was Ricky was going to take care of business over and over again and really no details of what he was doing. The fights Kira kept starting with him about his cheating got old really quickly and just lead ti the demise of this book. I have the next book but don't know if I'll read kn since this one was do dissapointing."
2,Not very satisfied,"This company is by far the slowest agency I have dealt with. I have not received any feedback from this company at all. I ordered this book on June 12, 2009 and I still have not received it. I have no idea if it's even been shipped yet. I hoped that as quickly as they processed my payment I would have gotten my book in a timely manner. At this point I can only wait and hope it comes soon. If I had any idea it would take them two weeks to send out one book I would have paid the more expensive price. At least I would have it in my pocession. I'll read the book in less time than it took for me to receive it. I would not recommend this company for anyone who wants something quickly. It's just not going to happen."
3,It's ok,It's ok but the second one was better. The chick in this book is spoiled and stupid. She got it all (because of her man)and all she can think about is were her man puts his di**. Who cares when your setting on a million dollars or more worth of stuff and money.
2,Mskiki425 from Coast2Coastreaders.com,"I GIVE THIS BOOK ONLY TWO STARS BECAUSE OF TWO REASONS. I REALLY CANT SAY THAT I HATE THIS BOOK BUT I ABSOLUTELY CANT RATE IT A BESTSELLER. WHEN I SEEN THIS BOOK ADVERTISED I REALLY THOUGHT THAT MS WIFEY WAS GOING TO BE THOROUGH BUT TRUTH BE TOLD SHE DIDNT HAVE HER SH%# TOGETHER. HOW YOU GONNA SNAKE OUT YOUR HUSBAND THEN SEX HIS PARTNER. THEN YOU DO ALL OF THIS GRIMEY STUFF ONLY TO BE PLAYED IN THE END, I AM NOT UNDERSTANDING. MORAL OF THIS BOOK YOU REAP WHAT YOU SOE. YOUR GRAMMAR WAS A LITTLE OFF BUT MY MAIN DISAPPOINTMENT JUST CAME AT THE END WHEN SHE GOT PLAYED BY HER HUSBAND'S BUSINESS PARTNER. HOW COULD SHE JUST SNITCH HER HUSBAND OUT, I REALLY CANT UNDERSTAND. IT WASNT NOTHING HOOD ABOUT THIS BOOK AND I BOUGHT YOUR OTHER BOOK BUT I AM SCARED TO READ IT. I HOPE THIS REVIEW DOES NOT DISCOURAGE YOU BUT IT JUST WASNT MY TASTE."
2,Very Slow,"This book was very, very slow and boring. The most exciting thing about the book was the last few pages. I think I'm going to sell it on here to get some money back. Better luck next time."
3,OKay,Overall I thought the book was good. Kira got what she deserved. At first I thought she was stupid for continuing her relationship. The money she took from her husband that the friend took from her that's what she got for giving her husband up to the FEDS. But I will read I'm Still Wife just to see what's gonna happen
5,As Real As It Gets...,"I had heard a lot about Kiki Swinson so I couldn't wait to get my hands on her first novel, Wifey and let me tell you...I was not disappointed. Wifey is as real as it gets when it comes to the wives and girlfriends of drug dealers. I admire Kiki for not glamorizing the hustler's life style and for keeping it real. An amazing writer, Kiki is definitely one to watch in the literary world!"
3,Good but lacking,"I think that this author is good. She makes the story good, with just enough (but not too much) drama. Her character grows on you and you feel her struggle. But it seems like this story was a basic sterotype. Why is our lead character so blindly ignorant to her surroundings? Is that how it looks to others? Being a drug dealers wife she should have at least picked up common sense from her man... but she didn't. It was a good overall story, but leaves you feeling like Kira should have been smarter."
2,not no wifey,"This Book Is Whack! this Is Not At All How A Wifey Gets Down.Kera Knew What Her Man Ricky Was All About Befor She Got Involed With Him,And No Matter What Goes Down You Never SNITCH!!And For Her Cuz She No Its a Risks So If She Could'nt Hold Her Own She Should've left well Alone! And Plus All Kera Did Was Complain, She Was Living Good, Play Ya Roll And Hold Ya Man down And Let The Side Line Chicks Get Crumbs!And My Man Russ Did His Thing Caues She Played Herself, If You Cheat Go Outside the Circle.But You Would Want To Read Part Two Just To See What Happens To Kera And Her Cuz!"
4,great book,Kira and Ricky's relationship was one of those love him this week next week you hate situation enjoy reading.hope to see more books from you
3,Miss Kira,"At times Kira was just too perfect and it was hard to believe. I didn't like all the label names that kept being dropped, especially because I couldn't imagine a millionaire wearing these normal brands. Anyway the story line between her and Ricky was the basic hood novel storyline. What kept my attention was the Nicky storyline, I wanted to know how it would turn out. Its an okay book. If you catch it on sale pick it up, if not don't waste your time. PS I read the preview of the other following novels in the back of this book... it seems to get more and more ridiculous and unbelievable. I usually love a series but this one I'm stopping here with."
2,Hmmm ... Wifey INDEED !,"This took me some time to read, I started from the beginning so many times and for some reason it still wasn't grabbing my attention. The storyline itself wasn't great as it was very typical, but the way the writer wrote, it seemed a bit better, it did drag on at certain times which made me put the book down as that is off putting. However, I do think this book is a good read , if you are really bored, it's just not one of the ""AMAZING"" books. I don't see it as a must read."
1,This story Sucks!!,The publisher should be shot!! How can you publish a book with so many grammatical errors and one where the story makes no sense? If having a drug dealer as my man was my thing -- I'll take me a weak softy like Ricky! !
2,Where do I begin...,"...let's start with the beginning. I've read other books with the plot of ""Wifey"". But this one was truly unbelievable...because the character's themselves where UNBELIEVABLE.The only true reason I found this book entertaining was because it gave me something to do besides listening to my IPOD on my subway commute to and from work.The writing was a bit over the top for me...all in all a so, so plot. Wifey is tired of hustling husband and his side tricks, finds out he's cheating (amongst other things), and decides to get him back. Turns Wifey get's taken for a ride as well."
4,Great Read,"Wifey is a great story of the woman behind the man. That is a side of the game that hasn't really been told in the way this author has told it. Kira (Wifey) is fed up with her nasty, disresptful, self absored husband Ricky. Following his lead, she no longer keeps him as her main priority, but chooses to look out for her family and herself, since she feels she is last on her husband's priority list. You know the old saying ""When you do dirt you get dirt."" In the process, she makes some mistakes (Russ), but all is well that ends well. Although this is a great story, this book is riddled with typos and mistakes. If you can get past those, you'll enjoy reading Wifey."
1,WACK,"i dint like this book at all ,besides having a terrible insulting grammar the story just didnt go nowhere,I had a hard time reading it and finish it ...Dont waste your money on this ..."
1,OH HELL NO!!,"I can't believe I even wasted my time reading this. Im so happy I didn't buy this. Take my advice: Borrow or just don't read. You can come up with a better story in your head. WIFEY would have been so much better if there had actually been some description. It was basically like, I did this, he did that, I went to the shop, I ate, I took a bath and so on. All she did was eat,work, and run her mouth through out the whole book. It was plenty of places to jump in and make it interesting. She just didn't take them. NO IMAGINATION. The plot was there but she just couldn't elaborate.In all seriousness I wish I could give this book no stars. But I guess you get one for the title and knowing your name. AND TO THINK SHE COMES FROM MY STATE.WORK ON THAT SWEETY."
5,A cut above,"This is a well told story with a twist for an ending. I feel like this book is a step above the so called ""hip-hop fiction."" I find that most of the books in that genre are basically all the same, without a great amount of creativity. Most readers will identify with Kira and her very practical nature. A woman who finds herself caught up in the game of money and drugs, but she is planning to make her escape. Read IT!!"
4,A Good Read,I t wasn't the best book I ever read but it was very entertaining. I will read the second part to find out what happens next. I would reccomend it to people who love ghetto fiction.
1,Wifey!? Doesn't deserve even ONE star.,"This book was horrible. I couldn't even finish it! I hate a book that cannot keep my attention. I figured at first that it was slow starting out but a FEW chapters into it, it was still as dull and boring as the first page. This was a waste of time even attempting to read when I could have been reading something better. Luckily I just borrowed this book from a friend and didn't buy it myself because I would have been very pissed that I wasted my hard earned money on it.Usually if and when I do I review I'll tell a little about the characters and the plot but this doesn't even deserve a well-written review.DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK. Please, if you must read it, get it from a library or borrow it from a friend.~RR"
2,Not all That!,"Ok, I just finished this book yesterday and I have to say I was disappointed big time. I noticed in the begining that is was starting off slow.I gave it a chance and it never really picked up. The whole story really got on my nerves because every chapter was about Kira getting played by her husband, running her mouth about it, but staying with him. The story lacked drama or suspense. Kira hardly even stood up for herself against all these women who were messing with her man which would be hardly unlikely in real life. The ending was not all that great either and the reader could kind of figure out that she would get played in the end. You can read this book to kill time as I did but please borrow it from a friend don't waste the money.You can get a way better read out of books like Sheisty, Still Sheisty, Blinded or Grimey."
3,GOOD TRY KI KI,"THS BOOK WAS JUST OOOO.K! I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED MORE, BUT FROM HER USE OF GRAMMER, I THINK WE BETTER BE HAPPY WITH WHAT WE'VE GOT. I'M SURE SHE MEANT WELL. THE BEST PART OF THE BOOK WAS WHEN THE FRIEND SET HER UP AND STOLE HER MONEY. I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS HER FIRST BOOK BUT HOPEFULLY HER WRIITING WILL IMPROVE. I WASN'T TERRIBLE AND IT'S A QUICK READ. I HATE THOSE TINY PAPERBACKS THOUGH."
4,Gangsta,I thought that the book was good. But she was doing some gangsta stuff by turning her husband over to the feds. I know her cousin got caught up but that was a decision her cousin made..And Russ was also grimey. But all in all it was a good book and would recommend it to my friends to read.
2,Trifling!,"I have to say that of all the 'urban' books that I've read, this one was a disappointment. It was okay, but nothing to boast about. This was the first book that I've read that I didn't like any of the characters. Kira was trifling, Ricky was trifling, Russ was trifling. Just plain trifling. Better luck next time!"
5,More Listening Pleasure,"Goldmark is awesome.The creativity is inspiring- especially in the freestyling makeovers of popular tunes. Joes originals are great too.An influence of Hendrix, Trower, Allman Brothers- just to name a few- from mild to wild.Thanks Joe, please keep 'em coming."
1,This DVD should remain a secret...,"I've seen several other documentaries regarding the crash at Kecksburg (Unsolved Mysteries and the version by the History Channel), which stated the facts; reporting the activity surrounding this incident. And those were great productions. That said, this DVD, ""Secrets of UFOs: Kecksburg UFO Crash"" is absolutely horrible.This DVD was obviously produced on a very low budget; this is evident through poor quality of the re-enactment scenes and the bad acting. Nonetheless, I can live with a low budget production, provided that they have their facts strait, and are presenting them in a way that would let a viewed make up their own mind.This DVD offers no new facts, but what is worse is that it tries to imply many things that are not factual. Productions like this DVD detract from legitimate UFO documentaries.Don't waste your money or time with this DVD... even at $7, it's a waste of money."
1,"If you must read it, borrow the library's copy . . .","I thought this book was ridiculous, absolutely an utter waste. Although it was a good idea, this book fails miserably at its task. First, the lectures are too simple for an honors chemistry class at a technical university. By the time I reached my freshman chemistry class, I'd already had 2 full years of chemistry and a semester of organic chemistry. I don't need a review on units. [...] I won't ruin it for you if you want to read it. [And] the book is full of stereotypes and pure ignorance concerning chemistry and scientists. And lastly, the writing is terrible. [...]"
1,SORRY,"Sorry to have to write a bad review. I know its was a used flap book. I was expecting a creased page here and there, but this book must have been dropped in water as the bottom of it was all stained and warped. I should have paid the extra money and got a bran new book."
2,Control issues,"I like the idea of a Diablo game in space but there's not a lot to love about this game. It all works OK, but not seamlessly. You use the PSP's stick to move around but you cannot easily direct your fire. You fire which ever way you are facing. It is all too awkward and drains the fun out of the game. It doesnt help that the camera is too close to see your enemies approaching so that you can plan an attack. Basically combat is more about you ""battling with the controls"" than ""battling the enemies."""
1,The Game Just Doesn't Work,"I don't have a lot of games for my Mac, so I thought this would be a cool treat. I figured that I could take a break from work every now and then and play a bit. But, this game doesn't let you save, at least I can't see how it works. It also is very limited in the play. I can't figure out how to get to other higher limit tables. It claims to have an online mode, but when I click that, nothing happens.I'm guessing that I have a broken game, but I wouldn't take the risk on getting another one. And at the price, it's not really worth the hassle of returning."
1,Total Disapointment,"I was expecting what I found on the itnernet at a website called Hard Rock Casino. This softwareis nothing like what that website had. Also, it didn't even have all the games it said it had.Lesson learned. Don't buy casino games on Amazon.com.Kay Breault"
5,Vince was the best!,"I purchased this book many years ago and am looking to buy another one. I loaned it out and never got it back. Vince was a real pioneer when it came to natural bodybuilding. Unlike the ""health food hucksters"" of his era, Vince was one of the first to push the high, high, high protein intake for growth. He was also a proponent of the more asthetic sweeping physique. He hated powerlifting and squatting. If you didn't adhere to his strict style of form, you might find yourself barred from working out in his gym. I loved his attitude and my favorite part of the whole book was the fasting routine. I used it several times and I have never in my life felt as good as I did following that routine. I want another one of those books! If you know where I can find one...e-mail me. Thanks!"
4,As Expected,"This book was as expected although a little expenseive at the price ($30.00?). I, like one or two other reviewers, was puzzled by the number of pictures of quite obviously steroidal athletes, considering how anti-drug Vince was in his views. That said, he tells it to you straight, and years before anyone subscribed to higher fat, and high protein diets, Vince was out there advocating the consumption of whole eggs, cream and other saturated fats to gain lean muscle mass. He also leaves nothing to chance on the range and number of exercises listed, most of which I wouldn't use, but that's just a personal preference. Not quite worth the money, but Vince had interesting views and was years ahead of his time."
5,The concepts in this book can still be applied today,"I've been an athlete (now Coach and Trainer) for 20 years. At one point, my 2 main passions were Martial Arts and Natural Body Building. With that said, I've read my share of books on the subject of Bodybuilding and Vince Gironda's book the ""Wild Physique"" is one of the best (if not the best) books I've read on the subject. He was indeed a Master Trainer and way ahead of his time. The concepts in this book can still be applied today, not only to Body Building but Sports and Fitness in general. He is to Body Building what Bruce Lee is to Martial Arts ... Legend has it that Bruce Lee studied Vince's training principles. Vince Gironda was a visionary and one of a kind. If you what to learn from a Master, get this book."
4,A Library of workout ideas with great pictures to motivate.,"This book is great for you if you are the sort of person who is motivated by seeing what your body might achieve in the gym. Full of beautiful pics of perfect bodies from Vince's Hollywood Gym,and a thorough examination of multiple different excercises for each body area. Also good tips on aspects of weight training and nutrition ideas."
3,barbeque thermometer,"This item is not as good as it's predecessor. It takes too long to read, while your fingers begin to burn. Wish I could find the older version."
1,Very unreliable,"After having had a temperature fork, which worked great and was very reliable for many years, we purchased this fork in December 2012. After 3 months of constant frustration and inaccurate reading, we are ditching this fork for good. The ditigal display turned itself on when stored in the drawer, only resort was to remove the batteries. We are saving the batteries and cut our losses on this fork. Hopefully our next one will be better, but definitely not this model!"
3,"historically interesting and informative book, w/ crumb!","first edition, november 1973 good book, interesting and informative the r.crumb dr.atomic comic in it is very good"
5,An absolute joy,"So many pieces on this album are jewels. ""Le fille aux cheveux de lin"" and ""Nocturnes for Orchestra - Sirenes"" are particularly heavenly. ""The Sea at Dawn"" has an amazing sense of freshness and motion to it and is well placed at the beginning of the CD. A few of the songs on here make excellent background music but lack memorable themes. I wish I could wake up to this CD every morning, truly."
4,CD review,"This is a great debussy CD. This CD is my introduction to Debussy, and now debussy is one of my favorite composers. The music in here is relaxing. The performances are excellent also. One complaint, however, is there is a repeat. There are two of the same pieces on the CD. Overall, this is a great CD."
1,What a Joke!!,We bought one of these for ourselves and We thought it was so wonderful we purchased one exactly like it for my mother to give her for a mothers day gift.About a month after we started using ours it totally went out!!(We had already ordered the one for my mom but had not received it yet)On ours Sometimes the doorbell would ring but no picture was on the screen. Very shortly after that got the one shipped that we had ordered for my mom but that one would not work at all !!!We are very disappointed with these.We have spent approx.$500.total for these two systems and they are both garbage products.We later bought a Commax system and it is working great!!We would certainly advise anyone considering a Samsung brand to not waste their money on these.They are certainly a joke!!
1,"A poor substitute for a ""real"" coin catalog","If you think you are getting a bargain when you buy this book for its low price, rather than spending the big bucks and buying the Krause publications, think again. There are only 48 countries listed. If you collect Austrian coins, you are out of luck. The irony of the situation is that the single most popular coin in the world, the Maria Theresa Thaler, is not even listed in this book.If you are a beginner and you just want a rough guide to the coins these authors consider to be popular, you might like this book, but if you are a serious collector of world coinage, look elsewhere."
5,Beautiful renditions,Christmas music in a magnificent setting. A beautiful way to help celebrate the Christmas Holiday
3,Andre Rieu is different :),"Andre is actually one of my favorite musicians and I just adore power of his talent ! However, this CD was a little dissapointing because it sounded sad to me... but then, maybe true Christmas has some tragic note in it... as Andre said - ""The Christmas I love"" !"
3,A little draggy,"I have always enjoyed the PBS specials, so I guess I expected more from this Christmas CD. Would not recommend it."
2,BORING!!!,"My ds received this for Christmas. It has only been a month and ds put the weebles in hiding. I have checked everywhere and there is no sight of them. Also, the spinning motions of it barely move. I have played more with this toy than ds has. I have been trying to get him to play with it, but it isn't fun. This one thing that doesn't do anything, I don't know if it is suppose to make them bob up and down, or spin. The ball popper ds received last Christmas is much more fun, and interactive than this is. I am so glad I didn't pay $20 for it."
4,Bella und Edward,"Ich finde diese Leseproben sehr gut und nützlich.Ich habe einen Einblick in die verschiedenen Bücher bekommen, weshalb ich erfuhr ob es sich lohnt diese Bücher zu kaufen.Fazit: Sehr gut und nützlich."
2,Not worth full price,what happened to Steve Madden???? he USED to make good quality stuff. while this is a VERY cute and comfortable sandal-- beware its CHEAPLY made and will fall apart quickly. within the 1st month the rhinestone beads fell off/ started to lift up. within the 1st 2 weeks the black painted sole wears out so it shows beige leather under if you even move your toes. its embarrassing and makes you look like you wearing old cheap shoes.Guess would say worth it if you get on sale and only wear say a few times to a few months- doubt they'd last a summer season!
1,Not as advertised,"The weather beacon is advertised as being able to convey ""your weather."" Well, the truth is that the free service only gives weather in select regions. If you don't live near the originating city for that region how does that do you any good? Is it any value to get the weather for a city possibly hundreds of miles away? Also, my unit was defective in that it would only display one color. Ambient said that they knew there were problems with quite a few units. However in 3 weeks, they never offered a solution. You can pay to get weather in your area but for $179 I feel this should be included with the product. Finally, the temperature that is indicated by color is rather difficult to decipher."
3,after you get ahold of thier other releases...,"get this. thier first 7"" on crisis, and the full length on rev are classic shai hulud at thier best. ive been into shai hulud since about '98, and very into the damien moyal era, so the origional demo on this (first 6 tracks) are also classic shai hulud. pretty much everything after that on this cd i would agree with the title ""useless recordings"". this is definatly for big hulud fans. if you are not into hulud you will most likely hate this. pick up zombie apocalypse, culture or strong arm instead."
4,Nice little piece of work,"I bought this unit because it looks cool, and was small and the right price. However, like a previous reviewer, upon hooking it up, I got the ""no disc"" message. So, I hopped on over to the manufacturer's web site for tech support and found a few downloads for updating the bios and firmware. These solutions did not work, so I emailed them. Within a half hour I had a response and an RMA #. So,I shipped the unit back to them, unfortunately, it was over the New Year's weekend so there was a delay in their receiving it. However, they repaired my unit and shipped it back the same day they received it. Now, it works just fine.It's easy to hook up, and plays just fine. I wasn't happy that the unit came with a malfunction, but I was extremely happy with the timeliness and helpfulness of their customer service."
3,ok so far...up until just now,"I got this dvd player and was worried about the other reviews others had left. But nevertheless I bought it anyway and it works just fine. No problems at all, small and I can't see what what the other reviewer's were talking about. Some other reviewer talked about downloading something from some website, which I couldn't find at all in the instruction manual. Although, just now I put in Rocky Horror Picture Show and it starts to work, then the CD stops spinning, spins again for a minute then stops, like the DVD player is struggling. I don't believe I'm having the same problem with other DVDs. Well if the system gets messed up the first thing I will do is change this review so nobody buys a bad DVD-player. Oh and I've had it about 2 weeks now. Good luck with this thing, remember if you get it and its messed up, you can always send it back."
1,Rotten Product and Service,"I got this as a gift for Xmas. At first, when playing a DVD, it would just stop in the middle of the DVD and you would have to reload the DVD and fast forward to the part. After two months, it will not play DVD's at all -- the screen just says ""DVD Open"" even when it is closed, and impossible to get it to work. When you try to call the warranty number shipped with the DVD for Argus Electronics, the number is out of order. When you try to return the gift on Amazon's Return Center, there is apparently a bug on the site (have been trying to return it for over a week) and the return options for a gift do not appear. All in all, this has been a nightmare!"
1,sneaky,you may think this is the whole package but look carefully there's no screen! i was almost fooled by this until one of my friends set the record straight. you have to have your own screen thats why its so cheap there are way better ones out there the only reason i put one star is because they dont allow zero stars this is the worst product eva believe me i know!
1,Don't waste your time,"There's a lot to like about this DVD player - it's very portable and comes with a box/packaging that makes it easy to pack up and take with you. The features are comparable to much higher priced players. However, now the bad news. The player functioned well the first couple of times I used it but its performance has steadily gone down hill. You put a disk in and it spins and spins and can't read it and will then say ""no disk"". Frequently, if you try to shut the power off at the unit or with the remote to restart it, it will NOT EVEN POWER DOWN. You end up having to unplug it to cut the power. I have taken ""problem disks"" to my other DVD player which is an inexpensive Sony unit and the disks play without a hitch. Stay away from this unit. All the portability and functions in the world can't compensate for a DVD player that can't even play disks."
3,Prism DVD Player,"I bought the prism dvd player about a month ago. I liked it because it lights up blue (so does my phone, and my stereo)But it doesn't play all movies. Or sometimes it would read ""No Disc"", then you have to open and reclose the player, sometimes you have to do it a few times, it will either play or it won't.Over all, it has played more movies than not. I do like the player, but if you like to watch DVD's all the time, you might want to pick another player."
2,You pay for what you get,"Ok lets be real...this is a cheap dvd player...very cheap...you cant really exspect 2get a lot out of it...i had got it for my dad for xmas...it lasted about a month..then when he was watching ""minority report"" it wouldnt play pass the part where tom cruise is going in the train...it just froze up then it started skipping on other movies i played...the movie had just came out of the package so it was not like the disk was damaged. It could of just been my unit that was defective...buy it and try it...if it dont work just send it back."
4,Could use resume play after power outage,"This is a nice LCD DVD player. I like the fact that this operates in DC and AC modes without bulky power adaptors. The cables and remote neatly hide in the small storage compartment. My kids figured out the operation with zero help from me.The only feature I'd like to see is the ability to resume playback after a power outage. The 12V power plug in my car cuts out when I start the car. Unfortunately, the DVD player insists on starting all over again. This is only a small inconvenience since we use this player primarily for long trips."
2,Poor Wiring,Buds fit nice and sound good but unfortunately KOSS used the cheapest wiring on these. Went out during my power walk and only after minimum use. Previous KOSS earbuds had better wiring and lasted nearly a year of heavy use. DO NOT BUY
2,Not very long lasting,"This set of earbuds didn't hold up for very long. Granted, these were put under the torture test of daily use by a teenager. Still, I can't recommend them."
4,AUSOME COMPILATION,THIS IS AN AUSOME COMPILATION OF BANDS ON LOBSTER RECORDS. I RECEIVED IT WHEN I ORDERED THE YELLOWCARD CD FROM LOBSTER. DEFINITLY LOVE ALL THE YELL0WCARD STUFF AND PARK. CLUE ME IN IS AN AMAZING SONG!
5,Great book and series,This is an awesome book and part of an even better series. Fred Saberhagen is an excellent writer and weaves a great story over the couse of all 11 books.
2,Not much better than previous volume,"Saberhagen does it again. Yet another boring, pedantic story with as little dialogue as possible. The dust jacket claims these are best-selling books so someone must like them. Not me."
3,"review of ""Four years for the Union""","It was very interesting, but too expensive. For the price you charged me, I was very disappointed in the size of the book. This book should have cost about half that amount."
5,great tv and more,"This is an exceptional series which got lost on TV. Trust me this is agreat series, well worth your time."
5,"Thumbs up for ""Rome""","The series is absolutely captivating. You laugh, you cry, you get drawn into the intrique. The series is well written and well acted. The sets, the costumes and the hairstyles and makeup are fascinating. It should have been nominated for an Emmy, but the powers that be never nominate a series in its first season. If you have any interest in this era at all, this is an absolute must see."
4,Excellent television!,"Fans of _Deadwood_ will likely find _Rome_'s rhythms a little off-putting at first, but it's a series that definitely rewards its viewers. The performances are outstanding--especially Lindsay Duncan's Servilia--and the attention to period details is remarkable. Schemes within schemes, plots within plots--the first season never flags and always engages.A note on the packaging: this is one of the most attractive collections I've seen.Heartily recommended."
5,AMAZING Series - too bad it is gone,"Note only are the episodes great, this DVD provides some fantastic interviews with the actors and details on the sets, costumes, etc."
4,Very interesting and educative.,"Very interesting and educative. I'll prefer less explicit sex scenes, so I can see the serie with my teenage daughter."
5,Magnificent,"Wow, top quality all the way. Even the box in which the DVDs are packaged is first rate. Everything about this production is excellent. If you appreciate history this is a must have. The costumes, the photography, the acting, the scenery, the history lessons, everything is fantastic. I hope HBO will continue with the quality and the historical accuracy of the first season."
5,FANTASTIC SERIES!!!! MORE PLEASE!,"TV has become so good lately that I stopped going to the cinema. Rome is by far the most fascinating, gripping, intelligent series I ever watched. So addictive!The first 3-4 chapters I was thinking that it was interesting but the feeling was that nothing was happening yet. Then the tension builds and builds and builds and explodes in the coming episodes.The dialogues are brilliants. The acting incomparable. The setting so realistic, I felt I was there, in ancient Rome. I could smell the streets.I loved the fact that they showed everything - the violence, the sex, the vices, the corruption, the perversity, everything so real and fascinating.The two main characters, Pullo and Verinus were great! Especially Pullo. What a man. Their journey from suspicious tolerance of one another to becoming close as brothers was very moving. And Octavian was just ahhh...I can't wait to see him grow to become the Emperor Augustus. Am going to buy the second season right away."
5,Action packed Rome,"If you are looking for a TV marathon over the holidays this series is for you. I have the complete set and it is wildly entertaining. The imperfect characters are attractive but never fail to show a savage nature in an appropriate Roman situation. Warm and inviting, cold and cruel, you never know what to expect next with this fun ride. If you like historical fiction and are not offended by occasional lewd and violently cruel scenes, this series is for you. Make sure the kids are tucked in bed or away at a friends. Graphic sex scenes make some of the episodes inappropriate for kids!"
3,ROME,"There was a distortion with Disc-3, Episode-8.Eighteen(18)minutes into the movie the picture FROZE and then continued.I was disappointed that there was a problem with ALL (ROME) issues per your remarks back to me."
2,Too much and not enough!,"Too much shown of the depravity and violence graphically that was not necessary to the plot in my opinion, and the characters for the most part were not filled out enough, One dimensional characters that were exactly what one would expect. I did like the costumes and sets."
4,Rome:The Complete First Season,A look at history from the perspective of both the common man and social elite.It focuses on the rise and fall of Julius Cesear.
2,TOO NEGATIVE AND POLITICALLY CORRECT.,"I disagree with the positive reviewers. This is far too negative an account of an admittedly brutal time of our ancient heritage. A wise person - Winston Churchill stated ""without Rome there would be no western civilization."" The script was predictable and petty, the acting bordered on constant hysteria. To get ratings which this series apparently did'nt. They exaggerated the sex and violence to appeal to our baser selves. I give it two stars simply because it is a fascinating era in history."
1,"Vile show, unless you fantasize about raping or being raped...","Would a show that represented, with such abundant & perverse joy, the enslavement or mistreatment of any racial or ethnic group be tolerated in 2007? NO. Yet both women & men enjoy this show's constant depiction of rape, enslavement, & the mistreatment of women as ""just part of ancient Rome."" Whatever. It's sad that sludge like this is enjoyed & hallmarked as a great show.I was willing to overlook the historical inaccuracies, and even the writers' gleeful celebration of gender inequality during ancient Roman times. However, the writers'/creators' ability to insert sex into almost every scene & storyline reveals their apparent sex obsession & addiction and/or psychological problems.And ENOUGH of the British accents & slang. It makes the show even more ridiculous!"
1,"Rome, The complete first season",My rating of this product is terrible negligence on the part of Amazon. The DVDs are set to the French language and so far I can't find a place on the menu to change it to English. Why wasn't the item shipped set to English. This is the USA and Englishis still the commonest language
1,Enough of the british accents !,"I totally agree with the people who complain about the british accents. If America is the New Rome we should hear a lot of ""Yo man!"", ""Whassup man?"", ""I appreciate that man!"", ""No sh... man!"" and so on (no to mention the ""f"" word). How do you translate ""Jarhead"" in latin?"
2,BOOOOOOOOOOOORING!,"I could not have been more of the thought that ""Well, there's an hour or so that I'll never get back..."""
2,Tedious Maximus,"I really looked forward to seeing some of what looked like an epic historical series based on the Roman empire, but what I ended seeing was a lot of violence and sex, and that seems to be the major draw of the series. Of course, a genuine Roman history buff might appreciate it more, and this series does have a certain epic quality about it.I could even cope with Romans speaking with British accents (what are British actors supposed to speak with?) if I had actually found a character or two to care about. It seemed like everyone was callous and brutal, and maybe that's the way Rome was, but after sitting through the first episode of this first season, I found myself not wanting to watch any more.I'm sure Rome will go on without me, and my best advice is to find a way to ""try before you buy"" and plunk down a lot of money to find it's not what you expected."
2,"Unecessary Sexual Content, No Battlefield Scenes!!!","I was hoping for something that was historical accurate and entertaining at the same time without having overly saturated and pointless sexual extravagances. All of the sexually explicit content in the series was not necessary and it takes away from the historical element of the series. I was hoping Rome would be a great series to show my students, but due to all of the garbage it is not. I wish they would have showed some battle scenes and not just allude to them. I hope some producer comes along and does a better job.This was nothing more than another soap-opera with lots of violence with some historical elements."
