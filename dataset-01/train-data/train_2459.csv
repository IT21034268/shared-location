4,Compact survey,"An extensive overview of torture, containing much photographic and illustrative detail. The sections range from torture in ancient Greece and Rome, the Far East, the Inquisition, the Spanish Inquisition, instruments of torture (such as the infamous Spanish ""strappado"") torture in the twentieth century, the campaign against torture (spearheaded by the likes of Voltaire and Edmund Burke) and psychological torture -- ""the torture of the mind"" -- i.e., brainwashing and the like."
4,This One is Pretty Good.,"I hate to repeat myself, but this book covers topics you are familiar with. It is done far better than other accounts of similar subjects covering torture through time in that Innes actually takes one through time. Nice job"
4,"Great for Quick Counter Space, May not last","This table works great for us on our camping trips. When packed it is a little smaller than a folding camp chair. The aluminum is very easy to clean up and you really don't have to worry about it getting wet. I do have my worries about its durability. Without the cover, the top of the table is only held on to the table frame by four plastic clips on each corner. The middle of the table can slide around and come off the frame. Because the table top is metal and the connectors are plastic, I think it is only a matter of time before the clips wear out. Be careful moving this table once you have it up. If you don't move it by grabbing the frame, you could pull the table top off and break the four clips.This packs up nice and is very sturdy for placing things on. We put two camp stoves, 2.5 gallon drinking water, and 5 gallon water can. Never was an issue of being unsteady.If the table top was secured better to the frame, I would give this 5 stars"
2,"Uneven coverage, unrealistic ""itineraries""","Despite the title, ""daytrips and getaway weekends,"" this reads like a poorly organized standard travel guide. Most ""itineraries"" contain at least a weeks' worth of activities (would anyone consider ""New York City, Long Island, and the Hudson River Valley"" to be a manageable daytrip, or even weekend trip?). Some itineraries list literally hundreds of different sites and activities, while others would entail 24 hours of driving (this is not what I think of when I think ""daytrip""!).My 2nd gripe is that half the book is devoted to New York. Pennsylvania gets a big chunk of the rest, while coverage of Maryland, Virginia, DC, etc. is thin.Finally, the maps are completely inadequate."
5,Final poems by Tagore,"I cannot recommend a book more than this one. I have read and re read this book so many times. This man's insight, joy, acceptance and fear of his impending death comes forth brilliantly in the Last Poems. Please read them, and read them again. I believe I will get his other poetry as well. WOW and Wendy Barker's translation captures the spirit of the author's work. She has to be commended as well."
2,Dora ABC Game,"I was very disappointed with this game. There is really no way for anyone who plays to 'win' the game. It is more of a practice set than a game. (You are better off purchasing flash cards at a fraction of the cost.) Once your child masters the pictures, there is no point in pulling it out any more anyway. Some of the pictures used for learning phonics don't make alot of sense to me either. For example, a bowl of cherries is used for the letter C."
3,"Not what I expected, but still OK","The game consists of a game board, a Dora game piece, and 26 tiles with all the letters of the alphabet. The object is to move around the board landing on every letter of the alphabet and then locating the tile that has an object that begins with that letter. The letter on the board will correspond with the color of the tile. That does help the kids, but I feel that it can be a little difficult for children who don't know their letter sounds. I wish it had more to it."
4,ABC game,"This is a good game. My 3 year old already knows the alphabet, we are working on their sounds now, so when you are done learning the letters, use it to make the sounds before moving along. Easy 1st game for all toddlers."
3,More like Flash cards than game,"It doesn't ""Play"" like a game- there's only 1 game piece. Good for much younger kids for letter recognition and some sounds. We play by matching the card to the letter, put the card on the board and then Dora ""hops"" from card to card. There isn't really enough room on the board for this. I'd recommend plain old flashcards over this game."
3,This is a great idea with poor execution,"This game is a great idea with poor execution. The child is supposed to find the picture card that begins with the same sound as the letter on the board. However, some of the pictures are not reasonable. For example, the ""C"" sound is represented by ""cherries.""Initially it was a fun way to quiz my three year olds knowledge of letter names and sounds, but after we identified the few that he needed to work on, the game became pointless.At age 3, he still enjoys playing with the backpack shaped game board and flipping through the tiles, but the point of the game is lost after the first go round."
4,Fun and versatile preschool game,"I purchased this game for my 2 1/2 year old daughter thinking it might be too advanced for her, but she loves Dora, so I thought I'd give it a try. This game is great because it is versatile for children who are just learning their letters as well as for children who are learning to recognize which sounds go with which letters. I adapted the game to fit her skill level by having her find the cards that matched the letters on the board. Later I'll be able to use the game to help her learn letter sounds. It is a cute little game for a good price."
1,abc dora explorer,"I knew it was used, but not to the extent it was. I was disappointed. I did not give it to my granddaughter."
2,Inspired...(fill in the blank),"1. The Residents make sense if you do not like Popular Culture.2. If you like Music, you will probably not like the Residents.3. If you're Weird, you will like the Residents."

5,great workout DVDs,You will get a great cardiovascular and muscular workout with these videos. Christian music plays unobtrusively in the background. You can move at a relative fast pace with the leader or with another gal who does low impact moves. She starts with some stretches then moves right into the workout--also finishes with some stretches--just enough at each end of the video. The gals are appropriately dressed so if you have children--no worries!
4,The master of smooth,"Classic, smooth sounds...Shearing never intrudes on your space...Always keeps the jazz heritage in the background, so you remember his roots...great late nite music with low lights, your lady, and a snifter of good brandy..."
4,works fine with xp,"Maybe the above reviewer didn't install the driver properly or maybe he just doesn't know how MIDI works, but I have this keyboard on my desk as I'm typing this and it works just fine with my computer running Windows XP."
1,DONT BUY THIS!! IF YOU WANT TO USE THE USB,I did and it does not work with windows XP period!Crap keyboard for USB use..0 stars
2,Does not cover entire ipod touch front,"Easy to apply , but a waste of money...it does not cover the entire ipod touch only the lcd screen part"
1,Junk,"I bought this a while back, to cover my ipod touch, i think i payed like 4 or 5 for shipping, which is ridiculous, because it could easily be shipped in a regular envelope. So I go to put it on, and it doesn't even cover the whole screen, it only covers a small square amount. I can't think of a worse investment. Not to menchine my ipod touch has been getting scratched up nonstop, while I wait for a full silicon cover."
3,Back is too flimsy,"After the first battery change, the back is more likely to fall off (especially in cold weather). You'll have to get the back put back on. The watch gets moisture in it when this happens. The battery life shortens and shortens until you have to get a battery every 6-9 months. Make sure you get a model that has a screw on back. The first battery will probably last longer than the warranty...although this is (in my mind) a manufacturer's defect."
3,merantau fell short of it's journey to greatness!,"In short there wasn't anything really wrong with this film. I just felt like it lacked that cetain something to make it special. I felt like it was a tony jaa/""man from nowehre"" copycat-counterfeit. It just doesn't stand up to other martial arts movies. I was rather bored and don't really recommend paying to see it. I also watched Iko uwais in ""the raid"" and I ddin't like that one either. I felt there wasn't really spectacular martial arts. It really does try though and that's why i gave it a 3 instead of a lower rating because the movie and actors really do put forth effort! Godbless"
3,"Good story, a one time only though","I read good reviews about this movie so I gave it a chance. Overall it just okay. It has a pretty good story, I will give it that much. The acting isn't the greatest, but then what fighting movie is? The two brothers who are the bad guys are so corny they nearly kill the movie. Especially the way they fight at the end, it made me roll my eyes how cool they try to act, it looked sooo choreographed too. The fight scenes felt like it was something fan made you would see on youtube. Bunch of kids blocking and throwing each other on the set up props. It seemed like a fanfilm for ong bak. SO story is okay, fighting was not so great. Its worth the price for a one time rental - standard definition streaming, that is if you love fighting and have absolutely nothing else to watch."
1,Buyer beware of all Magnolia products,"I read elsewhere that the original release of this movie was 136 minutes. So Magnolia has apparently chopped nearly half an hour out for the US version. Stupid! I was all ready to buy, and now I'm not going to. Would it kill the studio to put both the edited and full versions on the DVD or Blu-ray? Especially when it looks like the extra features are pretty much non-existent. Don't buy edited garbage from Magnolia!"
2,"Slow, nave and boring","Ok, as people say, this is the rite of passage of Iko Uwais, so, don't expect so much.But if we make a comparison with Ong Bak (they are neighbors countries anyway) there are oceans away of action standards.Iko Uwais and Tony Jaa will be never be compared. One is a master of choreography, the Indonesian is just a fine fighter, no more no less.G. Evans, by the way, just broke through in the martial art scenes, he still need to watch Hong Kong standards of movement and reality.I mean, it is just a first movie, don't expect too much (according to this duet), however the elevator's scene is hot (and I assume that brown guy is The Raid's Mad Dog)... and of course, a much better and compact movie is The Raid, that's is breathtaking (not this one)."
3,"Not Raid Redemption, but it has it's moments.","I ordered this DVD after watching Iko Uwais' action in Raid Redemption. Don't think the movies are anything like each other. If you want to see a ""raw"" Iko Uwais, then this movie is worth a look. Raid Redemption is a better movie by far. Raid Redemption has shoot-outs, bigger and better fight scenes, a better story, and a bigger budget.The end of Marantau was also a big reason my wife and I did not like this movie. (no spoilers)"
5,Highly recommend this movie!,"The movie is superb - great martial arts, good story as well. Had not heard of the movie, nor the Indonesian martial arts movie star, but it was a really good movie!! LOVED IT!!"
3,"great value ""BUT""","this wall light arrived on time and was in good condition.the instrustions were hard to read.the lamp comes assembled so you have to de-assemble it to mount it.3 things i did not like were that there were no wall screws provided(very cheap)and slowed down the project as i had to hunt down some spare screws.the lamp is metal but its looks to be painted the ""brass"" rings are a muddy gold color not brass and the biggest thing was that the lamp does not come flush with the wall the sale image would lead you to assume that it mounts flush.the inside housing protrudes about a half inch which makes it look to me slightly odd.the good things are it is pretty big, lights up the porch well with a 60 watt bulb and was inexpensives and looks good."
4,Strong Medicine,"Cumpian's performances are more evocative than the written page, still it works. Very good stuff from a hard working Chicano poet."
2,Oh Well,"As a NP student we are required to know the basics of 12 lead. Well, this books spends 50 pages - interspersed info w/ strips that are relatively small (for a book),give some highly detailed information, along w/ the rare easy to understand stuff. Do not feel this book gave up the ""education/info"" needed to do a lot of the practice strips.Purchase was obviously a mistake. Definately lots of practice strips in the back - Get a magnifying glass if you are over 30. I did go end up purchasing a different book that was much more helpful"
2,I got an older book than the one displayed on Amazon,"I got a second-hand book. The picture displayed on your site was of a newer edition. I ended up keeping the book because I thought wouldbe useful for a test I was going to take. However, I was disapointed that I did not get the right product. Hey, Walmart also sell at equivalent prices or less. Next time, I will consider them or someplace else. By the way... The book wasn't useful at all. Gave a 2 stars just because there was one EKG that was good to look at. Your associated seller should be honest and not offer products that they don't have."
4,good simple filter,"Well constructed, good optics; i'm using with a summilux 35 mm asph and works pretty well. As good as the B&W"
4,"slime doesnt work, but the tubes do","I bought these tubes because I was getting a lot of puncture flats. These tubes worked just like normal tubes, I still got flats. They were great tubes at a great price, but to me, the slime was just a gimmick that provided no advantage over any other tube of equal thickness."
1,Not Reliable,"Have had several of these tubes and they all seem to develop slow leaks around the stem. Also, I'm not sure the slime works, it just got all over the inside of my tire but didn't actually stop the leak."
1,Complete garbage,"I had one on each wheel; when it got punctured the slime didn't work and just leaked everywhere sometimes through the valve. The same thing happened later on the rear tire, it got punctured and the slime didn't help at all. Both times I could not patch the tube because the slime would wet the bottom of my patch causing it to eventually peel away. Slime tubes were an absolute waste of money and prevented me from patching them. On a side note Slime's patches when applied to a non-slime tube are the best patches I've ever used."
1,Avoid this product!!!,I ordered four of these tubes to try out. Two of them were defective -- the valves stuck. One of them spewed green slime all over the place. I'll never buy another one again.
2,still had a flat,I bought these because I was getting frequent flat tires... After usuing this tube my tire went flat on the second ride.... Go figure!!!
1,Don't recommend.,I would not suggest this tube. They don't work that well. Definitely make a mess and don't seal well enough for this type of tyre. The goop tends to clog the presta valves. i wasted money on these. Do not buy them.
1,waste,"I have slime tubes on my mountain bike, which work great. Thinking that it would be a good idea to get slime tubes for my road bike, I purchased two. Both failed miserably. I popped the front tire on my third ride out. When I went to pump it up with my hand pump, the valve snapped in half. Exactly two days later, on making a sharp turn, the second slime tube popped. I pumped it up, but the slime didn't seal the leak and the tube deflated, spewing the slime all over the tire and making a mess of a fix. I bought normal tubes and haven't had a problem since."
1,Junk,"Valve stems break and spray slime all over bike. Happened with several tubes. Slime works sometimes and at other times it doesn't. Also, slime makes it impossible to patch a tube when the slime fails, as it usually does. No matter how hard you try to clean the area by the punture the slime contaminates the patch and causes another flat. Worthless junk. Actually had far fewer flats with standard Michelin tubes than with the slime tubes and the Michelin's never had a problem with the valve stem breaking."
5,Saves the day - unless you enjoy carting around a dozen tubes,"There is nothing worse than getting delayed on my trip to the local coffee shop - especially when it is two flat tires in the space of 5 miles. Grrr... Between glass and those star shaped denizens of evil that drop from the trees around here, flats were getting to be a way of life, and I was seriously considering lining armadillo tires with sheet metal. No need to get hysterical. I have not had a single flat since swapping my tubes for these babies.A couple of times I have noticed low pressure - pulled out one of those little barbs. Spun the wheel up so that the valve is at the 2 o'clock position and have been able to refill no problems - with no slow leaks noticed in the following few days."
2,Failed Valve,I have used slime tubes on my 26 inch rims with some success. I installed one on my road bike and after a few months the valve got stuck open. The slime eventually fouled the valve. Essentially the valve is a hole in the tube and the slime did attempt to close this hole. I would NOT recommend it for presta valves.
2,Functionally challenged,"Vertical tear caused this thing to become an unpatchable mess. Conceptually sound but, in practice, never got the chance to shine."
4,I like the the product,"The Slime Smart tube is functioning, I only wish I'd bought inner tubes that came with Strader valves instead of the Presta valves. The one inner tube will hold air enough to engage the Presta valve and the other inner tube well, it lets air out of the tube as fast as I pump air into it! I do not suggest filling with air( the tire and tube could explode causing injury) pump. So here's what I did I put the Smart Slime inner tube on the rear and just kept the old tube with the strader vale on the front. I won't be returning the tube though because when I inflate the other tube with enough air I think it'll function too."
3,"Helps, but not enough","I've used this tube for a few months now on my road bike, and I've had 1 flat that sealed immediatly and only needed more air, and 1 flat that I had to patch or replace the tube. I would guess this helps reduce flats a bit, but I'm not sure it's worth the extra money, and you still need to carry repair and reinflating kits, so it doesn't save you space or weight on the ride. A great idea, but it doesn't quite live up to its promise."
1,Does not deliver on promise.,"I bought these based on the promise that it would fill small holes (lots of thorns in Colorado = lots of pinhole size punctures, which can become very costly). Took them out, and less than five miles into the ride, I caught a thorn. After hand-pumping the tire twice, I finally got home. Hand-pumped again and it still went flat. No green goo like others had bragged about. Just a flat tire on a more costly tube. Lame."
1,Worthless for road bikes.,"I've been dumb enough to try these 4 times and every time the result has been he same. With a normal flat tire you have to stop your ride and replace a tire. With a flat slime tire you have to stop you ride, replace a tire and clean sticky green ooze of your bike, your clothes and your hands. The tires I've used have been the 700 x 19-25 road tires. These require high pressure to prevent pinch flats but at 100+ psi the air pressure forces the slime out with an impressive velocity and there is no time for it to congeal and plug the opening. It just sprays everywhere and makes a mess. It is also very difficult to remove once it dries. Maybe it would be useful on a low pressure mountain bike tire but they are worthless on a road bike."
1,Waste of Money,"I tried these out 3 separate times. Twice I had flats that the slime could not seal (what's the point of them then?) and the other time the stem broke off. These are poor quality stems and just poor quality tubes in general. The slime is a mess too; it gets all over the inside of your tire, hands and pump. $3 tubes from a LBS are much more reliable and cheaper. These should be taken off the market (road bike model only)."
2,Presta screw bent,"First time i used this the screw bent, though i filled it at an odd angle. I've done this before with other presta tubes no problem. If you get these just be a bit careful."
4,Excellent road hazard tube,"These tubes add a little more weight, but when your clipping along at 35 MPH, the last thing you want is a blowout. Instant seal and can get you through your ride without a stop and tube change on the side of the roadway."
1,May not be for all rim types,"Installed on a hybrid bike with tall rims. Tube falled as I was filling it up with air around the valve stem. Evidently tube and rim were a bad match, but description said it would work with that type of rim."
2,Cheap manufacturing,"2 stars bestowed on this product is a stretch, but only because it did self-heal tiny puncture wounds a few times.Other than that, the rubber is paper-thin and could be punctured with just about anything on the road. Furthermore, they are not built to last. I slightly bent the valve stem on a 3-month slime tube, and it snapped right off the main rubber tubing. Slime itself might be a marvel product, but the tubes are cheaply made.Verdict: don't spend the extra money on slime tubes. I'm now getting tube liners and normal, less expensive tubes."
5,Slime smart Bicycle tube,The slime smart tubes work perfectly. Just be sure you check the size of your bicycle's inner tube before ordering.
5,Must Have Book,Forensic DNA Typing by Butler is a must have in the field. It does and excellent job of conveying the information to students and it relevant and a must have as a reference in the field. It made the subject matter easy to understand and accessible as a student and is relative and helpful on subsequent revisits working in the field. If you are using this for a class and may want to work in the forensic DNA field in the future hold on to this book or you will wind up having to re-buy it.
4,Great book for learning DNA,This book is a great book for teaching DNA. It breaks down the information pretty good in some areas but not as well in others. Overall I would say it is a good book.
5,Superb Learning Reference,"This is the best document I have yet seen that teaches the fundamentals of STR analysis. It also has the most up-to-date information about the latest available technology for STR analysis. It is well written, complete and concise, very easy to read, and even has practical anecdotes. A must have for anyone teaching or learning STR analysis."
4,Fun alone or with a friend,"This is the sort of book you're never too sure about if you can't see it ahead of time, but I took the chance and gave this as a gift to my puzzle-loving husband. It's been the sort of thing we pull out to entertain each other with--one reads the puzzle out loud and we both try to come up with answers--and it has been great fun for months. We deliberately do them sporadically so that we're spreading out the enjoyment, not usually more than 2 puzzles at a time, and it's been consistent fun. The puzzles are just the right challenge level--not so easy we can kid ourselves that we're brilliant and not so hard that we have to lick our wounds after. We have a few other books of this ilk that we abandoned for being either almost childish or too Mensa-full-of-itself, or even for not being puzzles that you can share. This one is like Goldilocks' best find: ""just right""."
5,Great puzzles!,This book is what it says it is. A great value. Cheaper than an iPad or a movie for that matter.
2,Not interested,"My six year old homeschool boy is used to the online Jumpstart so I was hoping this would interest him. Unfortunately it didn't hold a candle to what he was used to. I got him interested in one game, but not for very long and it really was too young for him. I think a younger child would be fine with it especially if this was their first program."
1,Very Dis,terribly disappointed. was expecting to get what is pictured and was sadly wrong. i received jumpstart 1st grade but its the newer version and NOT what is pictured.
1,Obsolete,"I had high hopes to use this with my grandson for summer practice. It said Mac compatible. However, it does not work with a new Mac. This product is too obsolete as formatted to be used."
5,The Best of Roald Dahl,"As a child, I loved Roald Dahl's books from James and the Giant Peach to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Now that I am a little older, I started to read his mature works. I never go so enthusiastic about reading a book. You get it all with Roald Dahl, humor, suspence, brutality, and horrific stories all end with a surprising twist that you will never suspect. The best reading in years. Highly Recommended. My favorite is The Great Switcheroo. He is definatly one of the greatest writers of our time."
2,Poor-quality paperback insults Dahl's talent,"This paperback is one of the worst I've ever seen in terms of paper, print, and binding quality. One story was printed in two different type fonts, the paper throughout is tissue-thin, and the layout of the pages is cramped and boring. Not at all what a writer of Dahl's stature deserves. Go to an actual bookstore and look at a copy of this book to see what I mean.There are options: Instead of settling for this cheap anthology, you can find very good, secondhand hardback copies of Dahl's books on the Web that have quality paper, good binding, colorful jackets, and sharper type and clearer page layout. This book is shameless."
4,Great Selections,"This is a first-rate collection of Dahl's works. I was impressed by his breadth of storytelling and his ability to create, or capture, characters in so few words or actions. This work only adds to his reputation."
5,Human nature never was this good!,"Bless my 8th grade teacher who saw I was standing alone in the dark, and gave me my first book by Roald Dahl! These stories stayed in the back of my head for years; they're 'grim' fairy tales that make you raise an eyebrow at the person sitting next to you."
1,One star for Amazon listing,"I'm only giving this one star to draw attention to the fact that this edition DOES NOT contain a preface by James Cameron. I could not find it anywhere in the book at all, even though the book is described to have such an introduction on many websites. If someone could enlighten me to why this error exists, I thank them in advance."
5,Roald Dahl writes excellent and imaginative stories,"Roald Dahl is a very good writer. When I first heard of him I thought he is a very bad and boring writer, but when I first read one of his books, 'James and the giant peach' I realised that I was mistaken. After that every book I borrow from the library it is a Roald Dahl. His books are full of humour, excitement,fun and a twist at every exciting part, which makes his books very funny."
5,"Roald Dahl, among the best writers","As a child, I loved Roald Dahl. I recall the story of the hitchhiker who was a fingersmith (pickpocket), and how those skills were very valuable around a traffic cop. This book is merely the next step for a Roald Dahl lover. More of the same clever imagination. You will not regret purchasing this book!!"
2,Not great,"I got this for my husband who is having a lot of difficulty with his vision. He had a very hard time finding the ""sweet spot"" on this magnifier. He finally gave up and went back to an older one. I don't recommend this item, based on his experience."
4,Effective and helpful,This device has definitely helped my carpal tunnel symptoms. I think it would be nice to use it as a massage tool AND have something with which to cover it to use for longer term use as a wrist positioner with the mouse. It isn't really helpful to rest ones wrist for very long as you just get impressions from the rubber all over your wrist. The intended use of rolling your wrist back and forth on it for exercise and alleviation of symptoms is VERY well designed. I am glad to have it and would purchase another for someone with the same problems.
3,Too high for my wrist,I really liked the concept of this as I work on the computer all day. But I'm small-boned and petite so I really found that this was too high for me to use comfortably as I ended up having to cock my elbow up and out. I ended up re-purposing it as a foot massager after a long day of shopping.
2,"I bought this because it was ""free"" with the $$x purchase, no like","I have to MAKE myself put my wrist on this. Maybe it would fit a larger person (male, larger that 5'4"") than I am. Not in the same category as the great foot massagers I purchased at the same time."
4,rv,rare book compartively in good shape. found it good. does not remember full details. will order more if needed. thanks
2,Looks good but squeeks alot,I bought and installed these on my Quest mini-van to try and improve the handling. I guess the handling was better than the old original bushings but these bushings squeek after only about 2 weeks after greasing them with regular hi-temp axel grease. I thought the grease would make sure they were quiet for along time but that is not so. I am considering inserting a thin sheet of HDPE to provide a slip surface that will not make noise. Consider me disappointed in these bushing's performance.
2,Below average electrician's scissors,"These scissors didn't work for me. They were sharp enough, but after just an hour of modest use cutting 19 gauge copper wire the hinge came apart and the spring popped off down a conduit. The Klien tools electric scissors are far superior in my experience."
1,Pediatric Nursing,This book is required by my nursing program and came to me as ordered. The packaging was poor and the book had slight damage so I would not buy from the same seller I bought from. Pick another amazon seller but the book was as described.
1,worst as the textbook of communication theory,"This book is very bad in describing the theory and mechanism in detail, as it can not do good in the balance between the detail and brevity. This book is spending a lot words on telling you the trivals behind those basic theory, but make you lost. And the English used in this book is not fit to international student. I even can not understand what the problem is when I try to do the homework. Compared with Prokias's digital communications, this books is only fit with the author himself, or those who already has become the expert in the communicaitons. In eductional perspective, it will be a nightmare for those students."
3,This is not a hardcover,"Just in case you get stuck with this book like I did, it is not a hardcover, it is a soft cover. The book in this format is thick, so you have to watch the binding. I haven't owned mine very long, but I can already see the pages starting to work free (hence why I wanted the hardcover instead). The books is good, the three star rating is more of a reflection on Amazon than a reflection on the author or the books contents."
3,Needs more mystery,"This game is pretty boring. There's almost no competition written into the rules, plus no mystery. Before you play the game you decide all the key features of the mystery, and then you play to figure out some qualifiers. I think the game could be fun if you re-write a few rules to create more secrecy and competition.On the plus side, the game went pretty quickly and the board is interesting, so there's that."
2,Not Enjoyable,"I'm an avid exerciser and don't dread getting into my workout clothes to sweat. This workout is too intense for this 51 year old female. There is no way to keep your heart rate in the fat burning zone. I had to stop halfway during each segment to let my heart rate come down. Also, I couldn't figure out why I couldn't get my belly flat. As I found out, too much cortisol is released during this workout. Once I switched to Beachbody workouts, I was able to keep my heart rate in my target zone and the belly fat is gone and I'm starting to see muscle definition. I never got this with Cathe workouts. I don't recommend them."
4,Good solid step workout,I enjoyed this workout but needed to do two sections to get the type of workout I need as an advanced excerciser. Each section is challenging and gets your heart and breathing up.
5,So Much Fun!,"I received this DVD last week but was too much of a wimp to attempt it until today. I loved it! I felt like I was back on the playground in the springtime when I was ten years old. I could do most of the moves and only stopped to catch my breath for a few seconds, once or twice. My only question is: does it work? Has anyone done this workout consistently and achieved results ... and if so, how often during the week do you do this one?"
2,Very hard and repetitive,"I've been doing Jillian Michaels' 30 minute workouts and recently tried this one. I've not even been able to make it through the first (and easiest) of the workouts and feel completely discouraged. This workout is MUCH harder and is filled with repetitive jumping. Other than for the intro, which in my opinion is the most enjoyable segment, the step I purchased is not even required for the 30/30 workout. I don't know how the other reviewers can claim the 30 minutes flew by. For me, it was the longest 30 minutes of my life. Not only is the difficulty level very high, but the moves are repetitive and boring. Jump and squat to the left for 30 seconds followed by jump and squat to the right for 30 seconds etc....YIKES. I'll stick with Jillian."
3,basic review book,"This book is really just a refresher. If you have forgotten the basics behind arithmetic and algebra then it is useful. But as for solving the math anxiety of high ranking more difficult problems, then this book isn't going to help you there. It's a high school level review aid. Not a substitute for a text."
5,I love this little known group!,"This CD has one of my favorite songs on it - ""One Fine Day."" However, I love the rest of the CD as well. It has a wonderful blend of rythmic yet soothing sounds that are sprinkled with a touch of what seems to be a mix of Oriental and African flavors, which would delight my palate if I could eat the music, as it most assuredly delights my ears! It takes me back to my teen years spent on the beautiful island of Okinawa! Bravo Hiroshima!Laura Berben, Ft. Myers, Fl. famval@cyberstreet.com"
4,four tracks that I liked a lot,"Track 1 -- mystical exuberanceTracks 6,9 -- peaceful relaxing with exotic instrumentsTrack 8 -- passionate longing vocals."
1,Drawing Birds,"The pictures are done in an impressionistic method. There is no detail to the drawings, they look like someone made a hurried sketch and never got around to finishing the work. So sketchy you just barely recognise their shape. When a picture is finished there is so much background you can't see the subject. Too busy, and hidden subject. I was wanting to see more detail, not so much drawing like taking notes type thing. I am sorry, I do not like the Artists rendition of his work. I would return it if I could. If I could have looked at the book I would not have bought it. I want realism."
3,it was so so,"i thought the book was ok, but it was not what i thought it would be. i do not feel fully prepared to take the boards for massage therapy. i feel there should be more questions on the disk. The book did help some but not to the extent i wished."
5,Life of a warrior,"A well written story. Consise and able to take the reader on a journey. Full of lessons in life, and examples of what a person is able to live thru and do in their life.Amazing perspective from a person who was not only able to survive unbelievable odds but do so with a determination and stile."
2,"Disappointing story, but shows promise to come.","""Fury of Rachel Monette"" is a thriller where a young Jewish woman searches for her abducted son, but soon finds herself at the center of an international conspiracy to destroy Israel. She crosses paths with another Jewish man with a dark past, and who is the key to the whole conspiracy. The idenitity of the abductor is shocking, and you will feel gratified at the ending, but the whole thing rings hollow by the time you get there."
4,Missing Peices & Board is very busy!!,"We didn't receive 2 game peices, the Labradoodle and also the airplane. We have tried to call the 888 # provided but it is always busy, any time day or night. We also felt the board itself is too busy with too many graphics, should be simpler. Not jazzed about the loosing the banker tray as well. It was much easier to use with the old design. It is a great concept though, and it's about time the basic game got updated."
4,A Fun New Version of a Classic,"This new version is a lot of fun, but takes a few plays to get used to. You use large sums of money to buy favorite vacation destinations from across the U.S. The utilities got an update to internet and cell phone providers, and the trains are now airports. It is a fun updated version, but the classic will always be a favorite."
4,A Pleasant Change,"Its a good change from the classic version.Pros:--Millions and Billions of dollars transacted , so it does improve calculations.-New and Modern places. (Times Square, White House , Hollywood)-Better Houses and Hotels-Innovative tokens.Cons:--Those who are used to the classical game might find the transition difficult but onces used to this , you will love this one."
3,Great game; quality not as great as the old monopoly - of course,"Monopoly is monopoly. It's always fun, and the updated version makes it even more so.Would be better if they had kept the old-time quality. Metal playing pieces..."
2,Great game poorly made,"Overall, this is a great game. Hasbro has successfully taken a classic and re-designed it into something modern and exciting. The reason I'm only giving it a 2-star rating is because Hasbro is doing a terrible job manufacturing it. The first one I bought had cards that looked like they were cut out by a monkey, and even the board wasn't glued together properly- part of the top was wrinkled and torn. I returned it and bought another. The second was missing several cards and part of the board was a different color than the rest. So you never know what you're going to get when you buy this game."
4,A Great Innovation,"The up-dated Monopoly had to come some time, and this made a great game still great to play. I am still a fan of the original, but I enjoy this version too.I have to agree with some comments about the money being harder to use, and that is true. However, I think it is a minor problem. The extra zeros on all the denominations make things a bit tough to work out, but this is something one gets used to when they play it a few times. The modern highrise buildings, (rather than houses and hotels), are a great little touch, allowing you to build ""up"" rather than across.The new locations are great, and the new up-dated pieces are fun. Being made of metal, they are very durable too. The board folds in quarters, which is pretty common these days, (rather than in half with some of the older designs).Overall, this is a great version of Monopoly and adds something to the experience. Although I would not abandon the original version for it, it is a great game."
5,Reality Beats Nostalgia,"I bought this version of Monopoly as a gift for a child I know who has never played Monopoly.I considered the classic version to satisfy my own wistful nostalgia, but overcame that urge in the name of having a game actually be educational. My goal is for the child to actually be counting sums of money and making change from larger bills, considering strategic moves, having some sense of finances even if they don't realize they're picking that information up ...This version is better for kids today. The absurdly low monetary amounts and references to railroads and such in the classic game serve no purpose. Railroads replaced by airports ... it's about time.Beyond just making it more relevant and changing , the rules of the game are exactly the same, and it's the same fun family game!"
2,"Fun game, but awful box","I don't know why they didn't make the board simply fold in half. The money holder and plastic hotel/pieces holder is really chintzy, and it's very hard to put everything away when you're done. This game isn't cheap, so they could have taken a bit of extra thought so the game could be put away more effectively. Otherwise a fun updated version of Monopoly that my kids can identify a lot more with, and the money amounts make a lot more sense. I could have done without the product placement in the game pieces though."
5,Lots of fun...,"It's fun to play Monopoly with modern tokens (i.e. Razr phone and laptop computer) and large currency bills. The only thing I don't like is the board folding into fourths instead of in half. It makes too many creases in the board, so it doesn't lay as flat as it should."
4,Fun FUN FUN,Played this with 3 college age students and had a blast. Like the updated tokens and the realistic dollar amounts! Only problem was it came without ANY MONEY.......had to return and buy at local store to play when we wanted...........OOPS!
3,Meeker Review,"I really love monopoly because its fun and educational at the same time. I mean, I can add, subtract, multiply and divide in my head so much faster because I played this game so much. The thing is. I dont really play anymore. I bought it because I kind of collect different editions of monopoly now. You should definitely get on if you are intersested."
3,"Counting the bigger money is a pain, split board is cheap, but still a lot of fun!","It sounds great when you collect rent and it is now in the hundreds of thousands or millions, that is until you have to count and make change all the time. I had no idea there was an electronic banking version so will have to check that out. Aside from that, I thought the board itself was defective the way it is now folded into quarters. I hate the big gap left by the new fold, really makes it feel ""cheap"". Aside from that, the idea of an updated game is great, and it's still a ton of fun to play."
1,Does not fit the i530,"Just as a note to any Motorola i530 users, this belt clip does not fit the phone. The wraparound clips at the bottom of the holster are too large for the phone and the thumbclip at the top of the holster does not reach far enough over the top of the phone to snap into the lock groove. Do not bother with it. This item may be mislabeled and actually be compatible with another Motorola phone, but I have no way to find out as I only own an i530."
1,Look for a new version/copy,"i agree with the other review on the content but the format, what you'll see on your tv is really unacceptable. These were copied to disc from analog and the result is not good. They need to be digitally transferred. There is a new version from Coerver that I wish I'd bought now."
5,The Never Enders,"Sonbert captures the darker side of nightlife and life in general with his depiction of invisibility, living in the shadows of addiction and excess. Gritty, violent, and filled with hope on this young man's journey toward finding himself and his own happiness, Sonbert portrays such a vivid image of Perry's journey, it's almost as if you were right there with him. I highly recommend it."
4,GenX Revived,"Every GenXer knows these characters -- their angst and frustration facing a pending adulthood that counters all they've based the purpose of their lives on and celebrates all they've learned to despise. Wish The Never Enders -- or anything, for that matter --could reconcile that emotion, but instead the book thrives on it and fuels it. Wanna feel like your 20 years old and alive again? Turn on some Pearl Jam and read this book."
3,Ok but toe section weird.,These seem to be exceptionally well-made socks but the toe-box is too square for my feet unless it shrinks up when washed. For the cost of these socks the seller really ought to offer more sizes as the size spread in the medium doesn't work for this style of sock. As I can wear them with sandals I'll keep this pair but won't consider ordering another. If your toeline is square rather than angled and you're closer to a size 9 shoe than a size 7 then they might work fine for you.
5,Excellent Product,"The quality of Darn Tough socks has absolutely convinced me to buy nothing but Darn Tough for my athletic training. My high school kids who participate in Track, Nordic skiing and X-C running told me to get these socks. I resisted for quite some time. When I put them on, I knew immediately it was so much better than I had been wearing. I purchased about two pairs of three different kinds of Darn Tough for my training. (1/4 height (thick & thin) for spring summer & Fall running, Boot length for winter running) Now, I have all of the athletic socks I need for quite a long time. All for little about the price of one pair of trail running shoes."
1,"Two sets, both with same defect.","We bought a set before Christmas at Walmart for $70. Some of the track pieces were defective, making it impossible to connect them. Some time after Christmas we returned the item for the $70 back, and picked up a new one for the now lower price of $35. This one had the exact same defect. The defect is in the metallic track rails, which have a narrow prong at one end that inserts into the rail of the next piece of track. On several of the pieces, the prong is about twice as thick as it ought to be, making it impossible to insert into the next piece. If you can get two of them at $35 each, you'll have enough non-defective pieces to make it useable, otherwise it's a complete waste of money and time, and a source of frustration."
5,A+ HARDCORE,"This is one of the most under-rated hardcore bands ever. RYKER'S was the biggest band best hardcore band from Europe. They have a great NYHC mixed with OI sound...if you are into BIOHAZARD, AGNOSTIC FRONT, MADBALL, BLOOD FOR BLOOD, ETC... you cannot go wrong. There are at least 6 tracks on here that are classics which have been in my rotation for about 7 years now."
3,ok,"it's OK even if it is a promo mew.But if you like promos whatever because not really nothing important,I got it for s*** and giggles"
5,An Essential Book on Plot to Utilize Both the Left and Right Side of Your Brain,"Martha Alderson's blockbuster plot works- as the title says- pure and simple. I have published two non-fiction books and one has gone through three editions. I have a new non-fiction book coming out in October . Martha allows you to use your the left side of your brain- what we in the aging field call your executive function-- and follow a system to create a plot. It is more than rules -it is an organized yet organic system that is logical and intuitive at the same time. I have used her method for my newest book, a novel. Although I had a great editor, when I discovered Martha ,my whole approach to fiction and plot changed and I could use both the left side of my brain to plot and the right side to let my creative muse flow. My novel just caught fire in my head -yet I could control it through Alderson's system of plot. I would recommend this book to any writer."
3,Where's the meat?,I am addicted to reading How to Write Books. I underline passages and write down page numbers I find interesting on the inside cover so I can go back when I get stuck writing. I eagerly waited for Blockbuster Plots to arrive but my enthusiasm quickly evaporated - I underlined very few passages as I plodded my way through the chapters. I love Martha Alderson's web site and I am sure she is a fantastic writing coach but this book wasn't too helpful to me.
5,The Mystery Removed,"Whether you're writing a personal essay or a compelling conflict, you've got plot. Martha Alderson takes the mystery of plot out of your mind and helps you put it into the minds of your readers. Especially helpful is the Scene Tracker, which keeps you in control of the entire story - every step of the way."
4,Blockbuster Plots Pure and Simple,"I find this book very useful, easy to understand language and examples of ideas are given. Have revised one writing project using this method and it now has more scope and depth."
5,Must have,"When I started writing I was overwhelmed with all the elements I had to keep in mind, but what I found is that plot is basic. This book is like a tool chest for writers, filled with all the compartments in all the exact places I need them, keeping me organized. I can't imagine writing without this book out. This is the reference I have out at all times, I never put it away.When I tend to stray I go back to the book and it helps gets me back on track with my plotting.Because I liked the book, I bought the kit. I've saved hours and hours of rewrites."
2,"Not a ""How-To""","The author is really witty and easy to read, but this is not a how-to on window dressing. There are few helpful ideas for traditional retail environments outside of NYC. Entertaining, not helpful."
3,recent purchase,I was dissapointed that it was a book from a library that was stamped right on the cover.
5,Wise advices by Doonan himself...,"Fashion Marketing is everywhere, especially in Fashion Windows where's the retailer's most economical form of advertising; bring glamour, fun, theatre and art to the streets, while visibly expressing the store's image. Of his approach to visual merchandising, Simon Doonan brings a wealth of personal experince and insight to these window displays. The ones who are interested in Fashion Windows, Fashion Marketing and Fashion Advertising, must have this book. (P.S. I bought this book from Amazon and received it at the right time and with no harm. Thanks Amazon.com )"
5,"""You should probably own one.""","Love this shirt! I took it on a backacking trip to Canada and out of the 5 items of clothing ithat I took not including underwear it was by far the best smelling, best looking, warm when you wanted and cool when you wanted and overall favorite article of clothing by the end of the adventure."
1,A Solemn Melody,A very disappointing recording. Our own church organist gives a far superior performance of this beautiful piece.
4,Great Music...Whether or Not you Understand the Language,"I first heard of this band from one of my high school spanish teachers. After hearing the music myself, I went right out and bought the CD. The entire recording is excellent, I have to say. My favorites are ""El Limite,"" and ""Lluvia."" Another fun tune is ""Hotel Mediodia."" I Absolutely reccommend this CD."
3,Decent phone clip,"The phone clip is decent. The phone didn's ""snap"" in like I was used to with other phones and their belt clips. Other than that, it was a good belt clip."
2,"Great Hold, But Won't Release","The clip is perfect for holding the 6600 without fear it will slip out or fall. But unlike other holsters I've used, it's impossiple to slip the phone out to have a conversation. You have to unclip the holster from your belt and use the phone with it still attached. Because the holster grasps the phone securely using the indentations on the two sides of the phone, you need both hands to pry it free. Secure yes, easy to use, NO."
1,Brides of Culdee Creek,I really enjoyed all four books very much. I am going to read the rest of her books. Good stuff!!
5,Great book!.,Really enjoyed the book- really liked the entire series. The author of this series does a great job of making you feel like you knoe the characters.
5,One of the Best,"This book was the last of the series and it was just as good, if not better than the first. This book, like the other three, was hard to put down from start to finish. The characters are so real and the story line so interesting that you just wanted to keep reading and not do anything else. When it was done, I wanted more. I would love to see more books like this; romantic, real life, drama, funny, almost every emotion. Get this book (and all the others in the series) and enjoy a great read!"
5,book 4,this is book four of a series and I enjoyed all of them. Of course the first one was my favorite and it seemed some plot lines started to be repeated.
4,an enjoyable read,An inspirational read with twists and turns that are not expected.This book closes the series - Brides of Culdee Creek really well leaving the reader wishing for another book in the series.
5,Loved it,Loved all the books in the Culdee Creek series. Easy read & great stories. Loved how the stories/families flowed through
5,Book Four in Series,Read previous books in series and loved them. One gets involved in the family and cannot wait to see what will happen. Series could continue.
1,Dishonest Advertising,"The product picture includes the Flex Ring Handle Pads but they are not shipped with the item. Now I will have to go back an order the pads separately. $12 more, plus $7 more for shipping. Bad way to treat a customer and bad for the environment."
5,Very Attractive Timepiece,"A great timepiece! Looks good and keeps great time. Battery life was kind of short but other than that, nothing but good things to say here!"
2,Wrong Item,"I purchased as shown a Billy Wagner (Houston Astros) figurine. I was excited to see this because i have wanted it for a long time, plus i am a Houston Astros die hard fan. When i opened the box that this product was sent in, i found a Philidelphia Philies Billy Wagner. This was not the product that i ordered. The company said they were out of stock on the Houston Astros, so they sent a Philies. I was very disappointed by this. Thankfully, they sent a UPS slip and said they would give me a full refund. I have not seen the refund on my card yet but look forward to seeing it soon."
5,"a heartfelt, emotional album by a gifted songwriter","Shawn Mullins' first major-label release, ""Soul's Core"", drew me in from the first song, and never let go. The power of his rich, soulful voice, backed up by only his guitar and the occasional accompaniment of other instruments, combine to create a beautiful backdrop for his honest, emotional lyrics. From the forlorn romanticism of the first track, ""Anchored in You"" to the hopeful, inspiring ""Shimmer"", this CD is a must-have for anyone has ever loved or been hurt."
4,Wonderful,"One of those rare CD's you go out and buy simply because you heard one song on the radio one time and you think to yourself, ""gotta hear the rest"", and you're pleased you did. Buy it, be pleased!"
1,Not so good,"Fortunately I bought these for $80 on ebay and did not have to pay $130-145 from other places. They are a terrible fit on my head and the bridge of my nose. I have a pretty big head and these glasses are to big and they will fall off. I bought them for preforming electrolysis and they will not do. They would be really cool if they could make them right. Don't waste your money on this product. They might be worth $40, maybe."
2,Not much better than a pair of 2.5 reading glasses,"An eye surgeon suggested that I try these for some of my detailed surgery. He uses them for eye surgery where he stays at the same distance from the field throughout the procedure. I have custom 2 power loupes but found the field of view too restrictive for some procedures. For my procedures I need to move from one area of the surgery to another and I found that refocusing on each area by moving my body position was too cumbersome.The depth of field (thickness of the area in focus) is much narrower than I expected based on my friend's recommendation. So, it is more my problem than a problem with the glasses. If you can maintain the same distance from the subject through your work they will probably work well."
5,Outstanding Tool,These glasses are great for those with low vision. They are especially good for computer work and offer very good fine focus abilities. They are worth every penny!
3,least favorite Elloras Cave,"This leading lady was very hard to like. The book started out great, but she seemed b**chy and whiny by the middle of the book. I just had a really hard time liking her enough to finish the book. This is the only disappointing read I've ever gotten from an Elloras Cave book. With the surprise ending this should have been a FANTASTIC read. The beginning was good and the ending was good, if the middle were rewritten to give us a more lovable heroine this would easily be a five star book. The hero of the book has a few issues, but his behavior is explained, I just didn't get why the leading lady was so hateful."
3,Harm's Way,"I loved this book. The author gave us a lot of humor, steamy romance, and action all roll in one delicious book. This book was so good I became an Elizabeth Stewart fan. She had become one the top ten author's in the paranormal romance world for me."
4,Weak Grommets,"The tarp fabric is nice and sturdy, but the grommets tend to tear out in the wind. We are replacing all of the grommets in our tarps with new ones and hope to enjoy them for a long time to come. Delivery was fast. The tarps actually arrived before we expect them."
3,Need page numbers,"Great book works really well with the kindle for iPad app, but I need page numbers that correlate to the book! Everything on my syllabus says only like 10-12 pages from the chapter but since I don't know which pages they actually are I'm forced to read the entire chapter! Which I get isn't a bad thing but I'm taking a lot of classes and I need to condense my workload as much as possible. Please make an update!"
4,Love having an e-textbook but...,I really appreciate the true-to-textbook quality of this e-book. My only complaint is that you can't set the font size for the entire book which means I have to resize the page on every single page as I read.
4,ok book,This book was required for a class. It is ok but even the professor said it was a little confusing.
5,A Fresh Voice in American Storytelling,"J.G. Hayes is a fresh voice in modern American storytelling. Choosing the form of literary memoir in this book--he announced at a public reading that he has two novels on the way--captures more than the truth. He captures sentiment without saccarine sentimentality, morbidity, or nihilism. There is pervasive hopefulness in these stories. He captures the commonalities at the center of human consciousness: hopes, dreams, fantansies, fears, and failings in each soul's notable combination of set ways, potential, and fate. His narratives are captivating. His writing has an elegant, rhythmic musicality, not just rock-n-roll, but the heartbeat of a awake and aware observor of astonishing everyday people searching for grace, forgiveness, and belonging."
5,Best product for feet and legs,"I discovered this product from a past massage therapist. I couldn't believe how wonderful it made my feet and legs feel. I've used alot of products that are natural and wonderful, but this one a must!!!"
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book from after reading other's review, however, after reading a few pages, I am starting get disappointed. The book talks a lot of memory tichniques that is not really something I am interested."
2,Disappointed,After reading Edwards' book A Tale of Three Kings ... a fantastic book ... I tried Timothy. It was not nearly as useful or interesting.
5,Really interesting,"Good answers to everyday situations, not only for teenagers but for any adult interested in understanding the Catholic Church's view on love and sex."
2,OK; but not all that great,"It works reasonably well, but one of the pegs snapped out of the socket the first day. Initially, we thought the peg had broken, but with some force we were able to snap it back into place. I'm almost afraid to put any pressure at all on it."
5,great for sore feet,"i am a nurse, so i do alot of standing, say, 10-13 hours a day....my feet are SCREAMING at me during the day and after, eventually interfering with my sleep.This item is perfect ! I will bring it with me to work, so when i sit down to do my charting its small enough to put right under the desk and work out my pain ! its simple, lightweight, and lovely !"
4,great for the IT band,"Length:: 0:58 MinsI purchased this product after a massage therapist suggested that I get something to loosen up my iliotibial band. It didn't alleviate my problem as I'm still dealing with it, but I can definately feel a difference. I've been rubbing this device along the outside of my thigh for several weeks now and am feeling much less pain and my range of motion is increasing as well. I use this in conjunction with a foam roller and also do IT band stretching exercises. The wooden balls can penetrate where the foam roller cannot but the foam roller covers a wider surface area. I would definately suggest using both if you have IT band syndrome.Since the device is wooden, you can't put your entire body weight on it."
1,Design flaw,"The 18590 pump is held together with 4 BRASS studs. These studs are exposed to the effluent the pump discharges and they dissolve in about three to six months, allowing the pump to come apart and the sewage to leak into your boat. Jabsco has not responded to my inquiries about this problem. Jabsco needs to change that design. Don't buy this pump unless you fabricate bronze studs to replace the brass ones."
2,Good pump but the studs eroded away,"The pump worked well at first. But the brass studs that hold it together eroded away because they are exposed to the sewage and because brass is a poor choice for this duty.The failure of the studs caused the pump to split open at it's main flange, and it leaked sewage into the boat's hull, plus the air leaking in meant that I could not vacuum out the tank until after I fixed the leak.Messy clean up project.So, if you buy this pump install steel studs to hold it together."
1,Lasts 1 year bolt corrodes,The bolts that hold the head on corrodes through even with grounding. I tried to ground the bolt but it did not keep it from corroding. I will not buy their pumps again.
1,I bought a new pump was sent a rebuilt one,"I purchased this new macerator pump and was shipped one that was obviously a rebuilt used one. In fact it was one that was rebuilt incorrectly. I ordered this pump to replace the one on my boat that had malfunctioned. I brought this new pump to my boat that was to be moved on a trip out of the country. I had to travel 1,100 miles to my boat with this pump.I installed it only to find out it did not work. I was extremely inconvenienced and had to disassemble and rebuild this pump inorder to make our voyage"
2,"Skips, and won't eject disc.","This player has a habit of skipping on DVDs old and new. I often have to jump to the next scene entirely to get past the skipping. Now I have a DVD stuck in the machine because, as others have noted, it refuses to eject.Worked for a while, but I am completely unsatisfied and have had a very difficult time getting support from Nexxtech."
1,Bad product,"When I received this product, it was defective. I also had an extremely difficult time getting my return processed. It was almost a month before I saw my return credited to my account. I had to write numerous emails to get it accomplished. I do use Amazon for many purchases and this was the only time i wasn't satisfied."
4,Not much has changed over the centuries,"Grace, elegance, sophistication, refinement and beauty is what we imagine when we think of women of royalty. Anne, Duchess of York, Barbara, Duchess of Cleveland, Elizabeth, Countess de Grammont, and Henrietta, Countess of Rochester are just a few of the women that are depicted in this book. Each held her own grace in society, but more so each had her own story, some of polished lives, others of dysfunction and scandal.I found this book an interesting read because I knew very little, or nothing, of the ladies. I smiled often as I read the accounts of their lives and realized these women were no different from the women of our society today, especially those of the royal families. Not much has changed."
3,"Look great, painfully elastic","I admired other ballroom dancers wearing these, so found out what to order & did. They look great, but the lycra is so strong it's uncomfortable, to say the least. They fit fine, but left cross-hatching on my toes. Also, the solid foot incert is too small so you end up walking on the seams. Obviously other women wear these & like them, but I guess I'm not willing to trade comfort for looks. I gave them away."
3,Item not as described,"I ordered these because the description stated they were 68% nylon/32% spandex. In actuality, they are 88% nylon & only 12% spandex. That's a significant difference. I returned them & will be looking for stockings that are higher in spandex content."
3,stupid colors,"I am a white female who tans in a tanning bed. I didn't want to buy tights that were too light, so i bought suntan. they're dark orange. they're a horrible color."
5,....wow...,"for me this was a real treat....i'm a fan of all three, and to hear them togetherwas incredible. the recordings were great and to me it honestlyshows where willie got alot of his influence, the true western side of texas swing.i've owned the on vynl years ago. but it was nice to hear 'em on c.d.i love it and recomend it to all fans of either......tommyg"
5,Love 'em,"I am so glad that I purchased these sunglasses. I would recommend them. When I look at the ocean it is so beautiful, it shows up the water and reef, they are good to use for fishing too."
5,love this group,this group is a group of wonderful christian singers. they have been blessed with such an awsome inspiration for songwritting and singing. i really pray they will play more concerts. this cd was sold out and i could only find it on amazon.
2,a question,"Its a pretty well written book, but Levick seems to even mangle english to establish her view. She keeps calling Claudius a usurper. In fact she calls him THE Usurper. But isnt a usurper someone who takes the throne through force and has no right to it? That is a lot different from the last surviving adult male of the imperial family inheriting it when there isnt a will. The book is very cynical in this and other ways."
2,An entertaining exercise in aprioricity,"While admirably accessible even to the lay reader, Barbara Levick's work has the unfortunate quality of total unrelatedness to fact. It is baffling how she attempts to justify some of the claims she makes here, aside from cryptic comments to the effect that Claudius 'would never have intended' or 'would be out of character' with regard to some putative intention. Perhaps Levick has access to the lost histories of Claudius, but if so, she should surely do them justice in her bibliography."
2,Poorly written,"I found this book to be poorly written. Levick seems to try to liven up the soporific narrative by inserting modern phrases and words that appear to be out of place. For example; it seems that there were a lot of ""hooligans"" in ancient Rome. As to the historical facts, they appear to be well researched but I think that their presentation in thematic chapters rather than in linear fashion is due to the narrative shortcomings of the author. Overall I found the book to be a disappointment."
1,Outdated,This book to find publisher's and agents was published in the year 2000. Most of the information is totally outdated. Save your money.
3,"Haven't installed yet, made in Argentina.","...turns out, the top bushing is compressed and I would not be able to re-compress it. So, I'm not sure this is for the back yard mechanic. It is an exact fit, though, but was disappointed it was built in Argentina. I'm going to have Big-o install these for me (2005 Sprinter)."
1,Only a bar.,This is not a complete towel bar. It is only the relplacement crossbar. No mounting hardware or screws or anything included. Just a bar. Only a bar.
1,bad bad bad,"This software is very limited. There are very few backgrounds, the clipart is uninteresting. there are very few frames and borders. The photo tool is primitive. I expected more from a product with the creating keepsakes name on it. this product is a waste of time and money."
2,Knowing the Holy Spirit through the Old Testament,"The book I received is printed backwards and upside down.It makes it very difficult to read! I have to begin reading at the front, butupside down turning the pages in the ""wrong"" direction!"
3,"Dance mixes of Alanis Morisette's ""Uninvited""","As you may have guessed from the title of this ""group"", this CD actually contains three dance mixes of Alanis's song ""Uninvited"" on the City of Angels soundtrack. SPIN has described the song as ""wildly popular"". I guess if you're a hardcore Alanis wannabe you need to have this disc.The spartan label reads: Note to Consumers: The versions of ""Uninvited"" on this product are not from the motion picture soundtrack CITY OF ANGELS"
5,Amazing,Simply the best police series on TV and this season is certainly the best so far. The writers and the actors are pure talent here. Just amazing.
4,The Sheild Season 6,"This is a season that most people will not like, I think. However, it's nothing more then a setup for the final season. Season 6 was originally supposed to be tacked onto season 5, making it one long season with season 6 to be the last. However it was felt that season 5 was too long and FX wanted it broken up. Then they asked for another season after 6, and here we are.It's still a great season with a lot to offer."
3,ok,I love all their seasons and this one dissapointed me a little bit. Besides the fact that is was too short the back and forths are very passive. But it is something that happends when most shows get to season like 5 6 7....they should just stop while they have good reviews....
5,The Wire,The shield only follows the Wire for the best law enforcement drama ever created. Outstanding cast and story lines. The cast is all reallt enjoyable to watch.
4,The BEST Cop show on TV!,"The Shield is by far the best cop show on TV. In fact, it's probably one of the best shows PERIOD! If you haven't seen the show, you are really missing some good TV!!!"
4,Why No Widescreen?,"This was an incredible season of a show that just gets better and better every year.However please be warned that this is not in widescreen as specified. I have no idea why the US DVDs are continually released in P&S;, so I recommend going to Amazon UK where these are released in full widescreen aspect ratio."
3,not very fun,"I was expecting to see a parrallel between their love story and the kid story, it's just a life story, so far... I am still trying to read it but I am not into it."
4,If you Loved the Little Prince...,"If you Loved the Little Prince, read about the Little Prince's ROSE! She writes this story from her perspective as having a relationship with Saint-Exupery, the author of the Little Prince. Interesting Story!!"
1,It is wrong to sell library books that are still in circulation!,"This book was taken from a public library and resold on Amazon. It still has the card slot glued in the back, the library labeling and a clear plastic cover that the library put on it to protect it! NOT COOL!"
5,love,"You ,Amazon, recommended it to me . It told me so much more of the writer of ""Little Prince "". nana --- It arrived on time and was in great condition."
3,Seriously Needs Editing!,"I cringed several times while reading the introduction because it is so poorly written. When I found out that the person who wrote the introduction was the translator, I abandoned the book. It badly needs an editor."
2,True or False?,"This a very interesting book. However, it's authorship is not without dispute. It is my understanding that the family of Saint Exupéry believe that Denis de Rougement is the actual writer of the manuscript. However, even if this so, it may have well been dictated by Consuelo so I don't see an easy answer to that debate. At least one finds out Madame X's identify in the preface.I have read ""Kingdom of the Rocks"" by Consuelo and cannot state that I believe the authorship to be one way or the other; although if this is Consuelo's work, very heavy editing is obvious. The Antoine de Saint Exupéry presented in this book is definitely not the one shown in any other book I have read by, or about him and until a third party arises to confirm the circumstances and authorship of this book I would say ""reader beware""."
2,Well... it's good for beginners.,"This was probably a waste of my money. If you've been weight training for any length of time the material in this book will not be of any great value. If you are new to the iron game, then the routines presented in this book are sound enough to get you started on the right track. The best chapter I found in the book was the one on how to lace up your sneakers for different sporting events!"
3,Good all round book for beginners,"I'm not an expert weight lifter or anything but I have exercised regularly for a few years. The advice in this book is good but clearly targeted towards beginners. Very well organized, easy to read, covers a lot of topics, but misses out on a lot of the finer points."
5,A new follow up to the Power of Product Platforms coming....,"As the co-author of this book,using this text in teaching at 3 universities, Northeastern, Boston Univ. and U. Of Penn. in their graduate programs, I have come to realize the power of this book's teachings, its rules and tools for robust product platforms and derivative products, goods and services as well as software platforms.We are now in the 4th edition and have published it in Spanish with a Barcelona publisher.Companies that Marc Meyer and I consult with have found it extremely informative and useful.Our follow up book will be an extension of this book, filled with rich examples of applications to goods, services, software and processes.Included will be workshop materials for easy application to the users' unique products and business services.Keep looking.......Al Lehnerd"
1,Didn't Get What I Ordered,"I ordered The Contract With God Trilogy, and instead received a book that only contained the one novel. I wrote to the seller, twice, and have not received any response. I enjoyed A Contract With God. I was hoping to enjoy the other two novels as well."
5,"Country, city-style!","Joni never ceases to amaze me. These renditions of country classics are too good for country song lovers exclusively. I could listen to these songs over and over. There is not a bad cut in the lot and most are absolutely outstanding. She pays a first rate tribute to the late Hank Williams. If you like Joni and country music, you will love this CD. You might even love it if you didn't ""think"" you liked country music."
3,TOO LATE,"This is a really good book, but it is a little bit too late. If I had this book any ealier, my collection will be another much better one. It is getting harder and harder to collect authentice precious Chinese Furniture now, even in China. But with the guide of the book, you can still find some treasures if you are lucky enough.With 5 years experience of collecting antique Chinese furniture, I have been enjoying and harvesting. But only with books specialize in academi articles, without any clear guides described in the book. But it would be so helful to new comers.It is really a shame I have the book this late. But I still enjoy it and being helped."
4,Hoya Infrared filter,"This is a good filter for infrared photography. I was pleasantly surprised when my camera meter still worked with it. I use this filter on my Nikon D40. You have to compose and focus before you put the filter on. It isn't as infrared as I thought it would be. For the ametuer, this filter is good. To get a really true infrared picture, one would have to spend a lot of money on a higher-priced filter."
4,On My D60,"I use this on my Nikon D60, it works quite well, make sure you read up on how to take IR pictures though, otherwise you'll just end up with a bunch of red pictures. If your interested in trying IR photography, you might as well get this filter, works great for such a low price."
3,Very hard to work with.,No distortions from the filter but isn't what I expected. Very difficult to work with in reality. Must use a tripod and long exposures to get a viewable image.
4,pretty good,smooth from day 1. i did wash the sheets before i used them. i used fabric softner just in case. i have no experience with nice sheets but im happy to make a nice review.
1,Book review,"This book is not friendly for beginners. I'm using this book for a class, and it hardly helps at all. There are a lot of tools that are more useful than this book for learning Tagalog."
4,excellent carb kit,"This carb kit included everything needed for a very good basic rebuild kit - it included the aluminum plugs, and all seals and gaskets."
4,Denny O'Neil Gives Solid Advice,"As a professional comic creator, I can say without a doubt that Denny O'Neil knows what he is talking about. In fact his skills in comic book writing are legendary. Many of today's newer comic creators have been inspired by his work, including myself. In ""DC Comics Guide to Writing"" Mr. O'Neil presents a very rigid, by-the-numbers guide and framework for creating a good script, which is essential for aspiring writers. Every writer looking to write for comics should read and keep this book handy as a reference guide. Hopefully, as you become more confident and successful with your writing, you'll be able to take risks and bend some of these rules to comic book structure. This is the book that's going to teach you the basic skills and techniques in order to get you there."
4,Very classical,"Mmm... I first gave 3 stars to this one, but now I have raised it to 4 stars because, as a classical source and guideline for comicbook scripting, this book has all you need. However, today writing scripts for comicbooks is much more like writing for the movies or tv series, so I suggest you search for true scripting advises from profesional screen writers and movie writers.This DC guide seems a little aged for me."
3,how to be a superhero hack,"This book concentrates on how to write simple stories on a deadline. While the author acknowledges many times that there is 'more than one way to do anything' he still trots out all the tired cliches that give comics a bad name. On the plus side, the examples of different writer's scripts alongside the finished pages really helped me come to grips with the formatting issues involved in writing comics. This book is worth buying for the structural tips, but if you write like O'Neil suggests all the time, you won't be writing much of any worth..."
4,Add This to the Reference Shelf!,This is one of the best references a writer interested in the field should own. I'm currently working on a script to submit to a publisher. Already it helped me avoid a couple of the common pitfalls. The author provides excellent insight reinforced with illustrations on writing for the genre.
5,Excellent and concise reference for common herbal remedies,"As a family practitioner with an interest in integrative, complementary, and alternative medicine, this book provides a well-researched and logical approach to prescribing herbal remedies for common ailments. Herbs are indexed by common and scientific plant names, indications, contraindications, and potential medication interactions allowing quick access to whatever you are looking for. Dr. Johnson has been thorough in his research, and I am confident in making recommendations based on his work. The book also provides a rating system based on the level of human trial scientific research (from anecdoctal to randomized controlled trial) backing the principal indications for each herb. This book is a must have for those interested in herbal remedies."
2,Works OK...not great,"Don't expect miracle results.....if you are heavily congested, the flush won't work and will just make your ears pop! If you are lightly congested then it works OK."
3,Some good info but disapointing,"There are lots of good pictures and some general advice for low allergy gardening but if you are only going to get one book it would have to be the Ogren book. The garden designs and plants covered here aren't going to be suitable at all for Southern California gardeners. Most of the plants recomended are high water use and/or cool climate plants. Not much thought is given to low maintenance gardens. The options listed for large trees are minimal. The very best trees, which are female varieties of separatly sexed trees, aren't mentioned at all. Common names of plants are rarely given. While there are many good pictures you have to read carefully to find out whether the pictured plant is recomended or not recomended. Overall I found this book not to be as usefull as it could have been."
4,Excellent source of information about allergies.,"Lucy Huntington designed a low-allergen garden for the Cincinnati Flower Show this year. Her book is authoratative and very informative about allergies and how to avoid or control allergy problems when gardening. Fascinating for any allergy-sufferers; contains useful information about low allergen plants, too."
4,Good book,"Lots of very good and very useful information. I was looking for something more detailed for people who haveChemical Sensitivities"" that are bothered by the ""Chemical emissions"" of plants and not the pollen. This book doesn't go into that. But it is a very nice book with very pretty colored pictures that discusses how plants pollinate, when and what precautions you can take to plan a yard or garden as ""Allergy Free"" as possible. Including plant choices, placements, etc. It does cover MOLDS and spores which is very useful to a person with ""Chemical Sensitivities""""Be Well"""
5,The Right Score For The Right Movie,I enjoy listening to this score as it was well done by Christophe Beck. I am surprised it still was not nominated for any kind of an award. The score goes along very well with the movie. And as another poster has already posted be sure to be ready for some higher moment in the score as some of the songs will start out soft then will gradually get louder and drums and the whole nine yards come in. Overall I would give this a 9 out of 10.
2,Not So Much.....,Ok for young children. But not so useful for my 10 yr. who is take spanish at school.
2,Polka dots? And too masculine.,"These were comfy and fit fine, but they were not at all feminine. Too clunky--looked like briefs for men. Plus one of the colors was white with blue polks dots. Not pretty at all. After I returned them, I saw the same product at Ross for much less! But didn't buy them anyways."
2,String Bikini,"Okay i rate these very low because of the sizing not the quality. I ordered a size 4, that is what I received. But they literally come halfway up my back, but have a normal fit in the front."
4,Jockey Elance,I have been using Jockey products for years and have been satisfied.The only problem now is the fact that stores no longer carry a size 4.Other than that they last well and are comfortable.
4,Bare Essentials,No real complaints except that Bare Essentials uses the United States Postal Service which is very unreliable in my neighborhood (believe it or not -- Northern Manhattan) so I didn't get my product. UPS ground is much better and I'll often not order from those who use the post office.
3,"these run large, order carefully!","A size 6 turns out to be much larger than a medium, they are way too big for me to wear!Jockey Elance String Bikini - 3 Pack"
4,Great new music,I listened to this CD and was really blown away by the refreshing new sound of Gogue.From the really haunting lyrics to the superb guitar sounds this really is a must. The tunes are all so different both in sound and words and I feel this is a really great debut from an amazing new Artist.Can't wait for the next CD.
5,damned near perfect,one of the best gameboy advance games by far. collecting souls will become an addiction.
4,NOW THIS IS THE WAY CASTLEVANIA IS DONE!!!!!!,"PERFECT PERFECT PERFECT .... not that 3-D poop on N-64 and ps2 ... 2-D goodness the way it should be ... ""symphony of the night"" is my favorite and now this is my 2nd best! best of all i can take it anywhere! lets keep this series alive by voting it to 2-D !!!"
4,BEST GAMEBOY GAME !!!!!!!!,ARIA OF SORROW IS SO COOL THARE ARE 300 ABILITIS AND TONS OF WEAPONS LIKE A LASER GUN AND YOU CAN TRANSFORM MONSTERS!!!!!!!
2,Too Easy,"When I first got Aria of Sorrow I thought it was a great game. Over the weeks following my purchase I changed my mind. While I was reading a Nintendo Power magazine they said that it is a challenging game that would take 20 hrs. to beat , but I beat it in less than 7 1/2 hrs. I also don't like this game because after you beat Dracula you can't continue playing, because I haven't discovered the whole map. Overall I think they should make Aria of Sorrow much harder to beat, and I think that you should think twice before buying this game."
2,Disappointment for Beginners,"As an Antique dealer of many years, I've become familiar with the pattern names, but since I did not sell (or buy) any, I knew very little about the patterns themselves. While the book is well written and laid out, I was vey disappointed in the pictures. Very few photographs showed the actual pattern itself, leaving you to view a distant image and try and figure out what's in it. I'm sure at least one picture of only the pattern could be included, instead of several pictures of different colors. I'm sure the veterans out there find this invaluable, but for a beginner, this leaves alot to be desired."
1,Bien Raro,El Cd Esta Super Raro..Unos Ritmos Muy ...Ni Se Como Llamarlo Bueno El Disco No Fue De Mi Gusto..No Gastaria En Esto Sorry.
2,:^(,"Not near as pretty as the photo. It looks like cheap cut glass, not even worth half the price. I would not recommend this product."
1,Didn't like it.,Didn't work for me. In fact I hated using it. Found it easier to just practice my technique without it.
2,Might scratch your violin,"The fittings where the bow-right attaches to the violin are hard plastic (not rubberized like I thought), which seems like it could scratch my violin pretty easily. I'm an adult learner, and thought that this might be able to help me learn to bow straight, but after trying it once, I'm really not comfortable putting it back on my violin. If you don't bow correctly, it's easy to smack into this and move it around a bit.If you have a cheaper violin that you're not worried about scratching, you might want to give this a try, but it was a waste of money for me."
4,Handcuffed into position.,"It works, it frames the bow so that you can't get out of the proper position, leaving you the opportunity to focus on tone, and body position. Be careful to get all the strings inside it before playing."
4,Photoshop 6 Shop Manual,"Great informative book even if it was written for earlier versions of Photoshop, everything in this book can still be used for the newer version of Photoshop, without the big price as a newer book. I use mine all the time and keep it next to my computer."
4,Two Strong Albums,"Each of these LPs is quite strong on its own. This material is from Fela's mid-70's period, when the guitars were massing and providing great continuum in many of the songs, and his music was deeply funky. But you'll also hear great, perfect horn arrangements on some tracks here."
4,Interesting and detailed,It is well written. The content and the presentation of cases should be improved to allow a quick understanding. I will recommend the book
1,"Save Your Money, Do Not Buy This Product","My advice is to save your money and not buy the 680. The MSN feature is worthless and unreliable. I live in Minneapolis (where there's supposedly a strong signal) and yet the MSN system has gone ""inactive"" seven times in the six months I've owned the 680. Each time means a long wait while MSN re-sends the signal, and the inconvenience of not having the feature work. I have updated the software, pushed every button MSN has suggested, and still the device continues to fail.This is the worst major purchase (defined as a product over $500) that I have ever made. So do yourself a favor, and don't make the same mistake I made buying Garmin."
3,there are a couple lacking features but it works well,"The 680 works better than a few other gps's i've used and had alot of features but needs some work on the usability. If garmin had just made the menus customizable so you can decide what is shown on the map screen and put a ""go back to map button"" on every screen i'd likely give it a 5, for example, if your deep in the menus you have to hit the back button over and over to get back to the map. Also, you can't see the speed or the time when in route to a destination. I am still happy with my nuvi but would probably not buy it again unless (cough cough to any garmin guys reading this) garmin makes a few simple software changes."
4,Great Product,"Works great, the MSN direct works exactly as they advertise and the software is very intuitive. Yes the FM transmiter is weak-guess what they all are weak and yes the navigation will do some strange routes- again they all do.My cons are price of unit and then still will have to pay for subscription when free period expires. The traffic portion on MSN works well but is not intergrated with rest of system as well as I think it should be. And lastly materials used on unit could be little nicer, I also have a Harmon/Kardon 810 that is beautiful and feels more solid but the Garmin is easier to use."
4,4.5 out of 5,"Wonderful unit! Love the new features such as gas stations with prices & traffic reports. I haven't used the Bluethooth yet so I can't tell you how it works. The fact that you get 1 year of MSN free was what decided it for me over the 660.The only drawback for me was that my old Magellan was easier to switch between screens. I suspect, given time, that it will become a non-issue."
3,Thank you God. FinalIy I got the GPS (Garmin 285wt or 285w),I ordered a Garmin Nuvi 285wt for my husband on black friday; the delivery it was supposed to be on december 2nd; I waited all day long and UPS didn't come to my house. I got the GPS next day (december 3rd.Can somebody tell Why on the BOX of the GPS says Garmin 285wt and not on the GPS (it says garmin 285w)Is it the same?.Thank you
5,GPS Navigator,"This product is fantastic. It performs and them some and I have to say, is fun to play with because of all the extras, music and books, languages, etc. Great product. Easy to set up and easy to use. Very user friendly"
5,Garmin 680,"My Garmin arrived on time and in good condition..there were alot of reviewers that had issues with the MSN Direct and I agree it has some issues. I live in Dallas and just took a trip with it me to Houston where it also worked. Overall, I'm satisfied with it."
2,Who wants these pricey options ??,"I looked at all the Nuvi models. Unless you love gadgets and can deal with complicated add-ons there is no reason to buy anything more expensive than the Nuvi 650. No blue tooth, no crappy MSN and no FM radio (how stupid).The 650's processor, GPS receiver, screen, case & battery are IDENTICALL to all of the more expensive Nuvi 6XX series.Hey I love gadgets folks but we are not helping the people who read these reviews for some common sense answers to basic questions if we do not point out which models for basic functionality.Originally I even questioned the larger 4.2"" screen - Why?: because you should not be looking at the damn thing when your're driving. Set your destination before you start and just listen to the excellent voice instructions.For those who just want a very good GPS navigator spend no more than what the 650 costs.PS: I thought everyone already had a bluetooth headset for the cell phone?Garmin nüvi 650 4.3-Inch Widescreen Portable GPS Navigator"
1,Garmin Nuvi 680 Defective !,"Bought this after owning many streetpilots decided to jump to the best Nuvi. Everything worked great as exp[ected until all of a sudden the GPS did not detect the satelittes anymore and it has no bars when it should be full as far as signal strength so the unti is Dead, now Ive got to call Garmin and get this thing replaced...what a PAIN!What the flip antennea guys it is a real piece of garbage!"
3,Buy a cheaper model,"The exta features of this unit over the 650 are all questionable, starting with the big one, MSN direct. I supposedly live in the coverage area. That is iffy. The traffic data is very poor in the Dallas area. Even if it were better, the updating is too slow for a commuter who doesn't keep it hooked up before leaving. I echo the other comments about inaccurate gas price data. I won't renew when the free year is up.I tried once talking to my wife using the Bluetooth, she said the echo was so bad she wouldn't talk to me if I used it again. The FM transmitter is useless in a city.The route planning isn't great, but it will get you there. The logic doesn't account adequately for traffic or traffic signals.Save your money and buy a 650."
2,Not to very good,There are some bluetooth conection problems with Blackberry and othe brands. I just skiped to use the bluetooth. I won't recommed this item.
3,This Garmin is OK not great,"I bought a refurbished unit. It takes a lot of work to get Garmin to remove the previous owners warreny registration and also to update the map if you get stuck with a 2008 map. If you need to enter a point you wish to go to in the future, you must first select map and find the place on the map and then save it and name it.There is no way to save a location that you are at easily, you have to first go to the map and enter it manually."
2,Internal Antenna Fails,"I've had the nuvi 680 gps for about 2 years now, seemed to work fine getting a signal until recently. Would take 10 minutes or longer to grab a signal, then would lose it after awhile. I searched the internet and found out that I should update the software on the gps so we downloaded and updated using the garmin web updater. The gps almost completely stopped picking up a signal from satellites after updating. After searching the internet some more, someone suggested stripping a twist tie and putting the wire into a hole in the antenna. This seems to work. Apparently these devices have a defect in the internal antenna and they completely stop working.My parents have the 660 version and they are starting to experience issues with getting a signal as well, theirs is a year old.The MSN traffic services does pick up traffic problems but does not properly rate the traffic backup time so you are on your own whether you should avoid the backup or not."
1,Touch Screen Totally Out In 1 yrs,"The unit worked like a charm. But after just one year, the touch screen totally not responding. Found many on the internet having the same problem."
3,Garmin Nuvi 680,Works very well for stuff that's current. Get very hooked on it. Having a little trouble with the updates from MSN.
4,Nice GPS,"I used the 680 for a month now. Very happy with it. Just a few minor issues. It seems to take a bit longer than my Dad's Nuvi 350 to get a GPS signal. The 350 will pick up a signal in my basement, not the 680. Still not that big of a deal. The 680 will lose the GPS signal when driving through the Fort Pitt tunnels (Pittsburgh, PA). The 350 does not. Bluetooth connects fine. If you live in a big city MSN works fine. I live 30 miles west of Pittsburgh, and cannot pick up the signal. The map shows I should. This feature would be nice if it covered more area, but it's useless on the PA Turnpike, or other major highways. I will not pay for this service when my free subscription runs out. Overall, is simple to use, and trustworthy."
3,Nuvi680,"The GPS gives some really stupid routing directions, the MSN direct service does not work well, but I think it is the GPS unit or cable, to find out I have to pay shipping to send the unit back to garmin and in a month they will have it fixed and sent back, would be nice if they could just exchange it espically since I bought it new a little over a month ago. The GPS is easy to use, lots of POI but some stores have been closed for 3 years and still list them."
4,best gps for the price,"Love this product,easy to use.But i do think the tom tom 930 would be better but it cost alot more. Tom tom have free updates to Poi and maps through all of there customers."
4,Review of NUVI 680,"Very good product over all. Only one complaint-1. I am not impressed with the MSN direct. It only works in certain areas and it is not always current. I will probably use it sparingly with the one free year of service. But after that, unless it improves dramatically, I won't renew it."
4,Nice!,"I recently moved to Dallas. I bought the Nuvi so I wouldn't be lost all the time. It works great. However, since I already have an iPod and Bluetooth headset, I would have been better off spending less money and getting a lower end model without those features. All in all a good purchase!"
4,overall good,"all features great and worth extra $ for this model. The map logic seems off on some routes but always gets you there. I think that is common in gps. Sound quality and volume good. Power not in GPS mode good,but drains fast if not plugged in your car."
5,Nuvi 680 by Garmin,"Great GPS unit. Used Quest for a few years. Made the switch and asked myself why not sooner. Drive about 55,000 miles per years. Covers rural areas very well. Would highly recommend this product. Great blue tooth; can play phone and MP3 and audio books through the vehicle speakers. MSN Direct is limited but a valuable tool as well."
3,Very small,"I think these earrings are pretty but they are very small. If the wearer doesn't have short hair, it will be hard to see them."
2,Nothing like the color in the picture,"I purchased these earrings for my daughter for Christmas. The yellow citrine is her birthstone. The earrings look darling in the picture, but the earrings I received look nothing like the picture. They are so pale you can hardly call them yellow. Too much of a hassle to send them back, so I guess she is stuck with them."
2,Deceptive size,Much smaller than the display on amazon deceptive display of merchandise I would have been happy to pay more and receive a nice piece of jewelry
2,bad color,these earrings are supposed to be garnet and are actually more of a wine color. were to be a gift for g-daughter. i bought 8 g-daughters birthstone earrings. imagine when this one gets her pair. they are pretty but not as described. they are not garnet.
2,minature,I was disappointed because the photos you see give the appearance that the item is much bigger and brighter than reality.
5,beautiful!,"my husband bought these for me on our 2nd dating anniversary 3 years ago when i was 17. They were the most beautiful earrings I've ever had and ever seen. They are simply beautiful! i was kind of careless with my jewelry when i was a teen and accidentally vacuumed these up and broke them. Ive wanted him to get me another pair ever since, but he says ill break them again! If you are looking for a great gifts for someone you love or for yourself these are them!! you wil not regret, thhey look just like the picture, but better."
3,Not as nice as the picture,I was disappointed to find the the stones in the earings I received were nowhere as nice as the picture. My stones are very pale as opposed to the deep rich stones advertised in the picture. I feel this was very misleading.
5,Butterfly earings,It was a wonderful experience. The earrings are cute. It was sent quickly and got here fast. I am Very happy with my purchase and the service.
3,sent necklace instead of earrings,"I ordered a Necklace and Sterling Silver Amethyst Butterfly Earrings to match and sent it as a gift . They received 2 necklaces the same and no earrings . I have reordered the earrings n another necklace so i will give another set of these as a gift ....... and I will keep all but there is a price difference in the earrings 19.99 and the necklace u sent was 12.99 . So u owe me $3.00 credit . Thank you , JudySterling Silver Amethyst Butterfly Earrings"
4,great earings,"The earings are very cute. I love them. The only thing is that they are a little bit smaller than I expected. If they are little bigger in size, it would be perfect."
1,Not the true color of the pictures,I purchased a pair of sterling silver RED GARNET earrings for my best friend for Christmas. I was extremely disappointed with the color of the stone. The stone is more of an amber color and will not go with anything. My best friend would truly be disappointed as red is her favorite color. I will never purchase another item from this company.
4,childish,"Bought these as a stocking stuffer for my wife, she thought they were too small and somewhat childish. Gave them to our 6 yr old daughter she loves them"
4,Cute earrings,"Got these for my younger cousin who was twelve, and its perfect for everyday use. She loves butterflies and her birthstone is amethyst so it was perfect for her"
1,poor color quality on two out of three,I bought three of the butterfly earrings and two of the three pair were poor quality amethyst color. Very light shade of purple. I suppose I got my money's worth considering what I paid for them. I gave them only one star.
1,Never buy this,"its look so cheap , don't worth a dollar .. very disappointed with this item . planning to return it back"
1,Disappointing quality and va;ue,"Not at all as expected. The jewelry arrives with a small bag, no gift box. It is way overpriced! This is probably worth less than half of the price. We did not give it as intended, it would have been embarrassing to give this as a gift.We will probably return it, and not buy from this collection again."
1,Butterfly Granet earrings.,Smaller than I had thought but came on time and good quality for the price. Should be a gift for a small person
2,defective product,Generally my experience of buying product at Amazon is good. one of the ear ring back fixture is loose so it cannnot be wore and i lost the back fixture very first day when i wore it
4,Good gift,Very nice & suitable for a Christmas gift. My wife enjoyed these ear rings for every day use. The price was very reasonable.
3,Red is not real,"The red in the picture, is nothing like the actual earrings. It is more translucent, and more orangy-red than garnet. Still, comfortable, and stylish."
4,Very nice,"Good quality materials, good craftsmanship, great shine and sparkle, and very nice color match on the amethyst stones. I would recommend them to anyone, and my sister loved them as a birthday present."
3,good for children,"I bought these as a kindergarten graduation present for my daughter. For the price, I didn't have high expectations. They're prefect for children's jewelry in size and quality but not necessarily suitable if you're looking for stunning gemstone jewelry for an adult. The posts bend under the slightest pressure, so I wouldn't recommend sleeping with them on either."
4,girl friend loved them,they are smaller than you think but when they are in the ears they are perfect i got them for my girl friend and she loved them. they are nice get them
5,Earrings,They were a gift to me from my husband. They are beautiful and as small as described. Beautiful color. Will not disappoint.
3,nowhere near as shiny as the picture makes it appear,"I bought the earrings in Amethyst color for $19 and was quite disappointed when the earrings arrived. The earrings are a lot smaller than what I have imagined and the color is nowhere near as shiny as the picture makes it appear (Both earring are dark purple in color). The ""body"" and ""antenna"" part of the butterflies are a lot darker than what's shown in the product image as well. These earring aren't ugly (I like the butterfly shape), but if you are looking for something that is shiny and stands out or delicate, these earrings are probably not the best choice."
3,earings,"My husband got me these for my birthday,I love them but dont let the size fool you, they are very small. So amazon you need to put the right size on there, that is false advertising. I got the necklace to match and that is so tiny you hardly see it. The earings are pretty though and comfortable. The color is very pretty too, like a deep purple."
4,Better late than never!!,"These butterfly earrings were out of stock. I was notified by e-mail and continued to get e-mails updating the status on this order. They arrived a couple of weeks later, and they were worth the wait.They really catch the light, very pretty."
2,Buterfly Earrings,Too small. The pictures were deceiving. Must have used a Magnifying glass.Other than the small size they were very nice.
4,Nice,This earrings are small yet beautiful and makes a wonderful accent to my wardrobe. I will be able to enjoy these for years to come.
4,Samsung 4GB Ultra Slim MP3 Player,"Excellent gadget, marvellous sound system, visually attractive, easy to use, appropriately priced."
5,Cool MP3,"The samsung k3 is really cool. Sound quality is is tremendous. The earphones that came with it tend to fall off my ear, the playlist feature wasn't available you have to download the firmware for it, drag, other then thatit's a great mp3 and is easy to upload tracks just drag and drop."
1,Samsung YP-K3,"Great MP3 player, but the EmoDio software is the worst I've ever used. I've had countless problems with it (the software). At this point, I am not sure dealing with the software is worth the hassle of owning this MP3 player."
5,my daughter loved it,"My daughter had to have one of these after seeing her friend's. She loves the interface and additional space over her old iRiver U10, and despite the fact I knew we ordered it used, the product was in such great condition it wasn't possible to tell the difference looking at it. Saved lots of $$, happy daughter, and very fast shipping."
4,Gives Great Sound,Samsung YP-K3JAB 4 GB Ultraslim MP3 PlayerI love this player. It is cool to look at and to hold but that isn't the most important thing about it for me. It is the sound. The music you play on this MP3 player will sound fantastic. I don't think you could get better sound reproduction anywhere.The reason I didn't give it 5 stars: I do wish it had a loop on it and that it had come with a case. But even so I would buy it again.
1,One I bought had defective jack,"I bought one of these as a Christmas gift for my wife. The jack on the one we received was defective. When you plugged in the earbuds that came with the unit, you had to spin the plug in the jack to find the magic spot that made the connection -- but even then the connection did not hold. We tried another set of earbuds and high-quality headphones with the device, without success: The defect was clearly in the jack of the MP3 player. We requested a refund and the Amazon return procedure went off without a hitch -- so 5 stars for Amazon but only 1 for the Samsung YP-K3JAB (only because you cannot rate an item as zero stars!)."
1,Software and Documantation Lacking,"I purchased this and it plays songs just fine. Trying to figure out how to make playlists and albums and sort songs on this is totally confusing. It seems to have some unknown limit on the number of albums and playlists you can have and the number of songs you can have in an album. I keep creating them on the software, download to the player and the song is there but no album. The documentation does not mention anything about limits or sorting. If anyone can help, email me at tukesmtn AT yahoo DOT com"
5,Love It!,"I love this MP3. It has everything - including touchscreen (which is the new fad). Store a lot of songs, pics, etc. No problems with it at all and I've had it for a while now."
2,"No, no...",Tha flavor Dulce de Leche doesnt taste like this t least in Mexico.I was surprised because you have really VERY good products... but this is only myopinion and my taste. Other people can prove and love it. Each person its diferent.DONT base your purchase in my opinion... will be a mistake.Da Vinci is great! Really grat and you have to do somethin to sell them in Mexico City.
3,really for beginners,"When it says its for begginers, it really means beginners. The first 4 or 5 lessons are all about how to hold the guitar, how to tune it, finger placement and stuff like that. I consider myself a beginner but not to that level. There are about 8 lessons and I only really got information from the last 2 lessons. If you have ever held a guitar and know the basic chords (A-G), you can skip this DVD and go to the 2nd one."
3,Who Mixed the Sound? Yuk,"They claim the dvd is remastered the why do some songs have so much tape hiss and some songs the mix is so bad, it sounds like half the band is playing and can't hear the rest, after exchanging it for another copy, still lousy sound on some songs, it's a sound engineer disaster, do they even listen to this stuff before they release it, it would of been great if they would of just turned up everything louder than everything else and left it there."
5,IM WAITING FOR THEM..,"HI, AT THIS TIME, I CAN NOT RATE ANY DVD OF DEEP PURPLE,BECAUSE, I STILL DONT GET THEM BY MAIL YET, ANY OF THEM,I AM STILL WAITING, HOW EVER IM SURE THAT THEY ARE MORE THAN5 STARS, THANKSFLAVIO. 12/29/2001. SANTIAGO,CHILE."
1,"Deep Purple - New, Live & Rare","I can't give it more then one star. All I have for a DVD player is an xbox, and the DVD would not play. I am sure that the video is great, I am a big, big purple fan. I was just disapointed that I couldn't see it. Maybe I will give it 5 stars when I get a chance to watch it."
2,BEWARE!!! Self-glorification abounds.,"Yeah, it's great that God calls us beautiful and He loves us -- but she should've stopped there. I couldn't get past chapter 3 because it made the book seem so self-glorifying. It's all about ME, what God wants for ME, what ME I MYSELF want to dream and be. This unfortunately, while alluring, is a lie. God's Word says that our lives are not our own because Christ purchased us with His blood. We are to do things HIS way -- NOT ours!"
5,Do You Think I'm Beautiful - Study Guide,"One of the best women's studies I've read. Truthful, Biblical and thought-provoking. Every woman should read this!"
3,"Honestly, I didn't finish this study.","I bet it is really helpful and beneficial. It wasn't captivating enough for my attention as a busy person, however. I can see it being a really effective teaching tool for young women, perhaps a high school Bible study?"
3,Doesn't fit the 1300mAh battery,"Doesn't fit the phone if you are using the 1300mAh battery, and the AD, doesn't say aniting about it. Beside that is OK."
3,Not what expected,"The holster fit the phone well, but does not allow you to flip open the phone while attached to the holster. You must take the phone off the holster to open it. Not something I will end up using (if I wanted to take it off to open it, I would just get a pouch instead of a holster)"
2,A real yawnfest,"What could be more boring than a book about the minutiae of flying, or a legal argument? One combining both of them. This snoozer manages to be tedious about both flying and the law. The author has been compared to Tom Clancy - for the techo aspect of it - and to John Grisham, for the legal aspect. But those 2 authors manage to create levels if interest and excitement never approached here. Character development was severely neglected, and its lack is felt. It was a page-turner only in the sense that you flipped pages as fast as possible in a desperate attempt to get to the interesting part."
2,"Just ""OK,"" I am afraid","This was very slow to start for me, and as the book progressed from the cockpit, to the Pentagon, to the ocean, to the courtroom, to the White House I kept thinking ""So what?""Its a little implausable that a pilot who ""just happens"" to be flying in a top secret military test zone gets wrapped up in the plot they way he does, and that it gets elevated to the level it does - just for the sake of reinstating his pilot's license?Pretty far fetched in terms of the story, but I enjoyed the technical side of the plot - as flawed as it was.A decent read, but I never really did buy in..."
3,non-airline Nance,"I was hooked on Nance's airline stories, but this is way too much ""Maritime Law"" 101.too much legalese, and not enough aircraft action drama. plot a bit thin, like Ian Fleming's James Bond- good guy, bad guy.I will try more Nance stories for sure."
2,"""OK"" might be too much","If I read a book and cannot remember what it's about a year later, it was a pretty bad book. For this one, I couldn't remember what was happening less than a week after I read it. The topic was a good one, but the overall plot just wasn't doing it for me. The characters were everything but memorable and the plot could definitely have been a little more exciting."
1,DON'T BUY this CD,"Love the Chameleons. Great melodic music. I was very much looking forward to this CD. One big problem, the mastering (sound quality and range) is by far the worst that I have listened to in years. Tried listening to this CD twice. Pathetic. Tossed it in my junk box in the closet. Oh well.PS: I spent over 3K for my car system and at home I have a bi-amped very good system as well, so it was not my sound systems."
1,Eddie's the best but these tapes must've been stored under water,"I can listen to almost anything from a scratchy old acetate to a monophonic audience tape recording from the 60s but this CD is just unlistenable. There was undeniably some catastrophe that occurred to the original tapes of these jams. It's a total mess. It's a shame too because ANYTHING by the late, great Eddie Hazel needs to be heard. I would take a free copy of this but I wouldn't pay one cent for it..."
3,"Good, but not great","The case fits the camera perfectly; perhaps a little too perfectly. There is only room to store either the battery out of the camera, which is recommended, or an extra memory card but not both. The battery charger for the TZ-1 camera is small; and even though it is small, it won't fit in the case. So when traveling, you need to hope you can find the battery charger since it won't be with the camera. Although not a problem so far, the carrying strap, which doubles as a belt loop, snaps into place on the back of the case when using it as a belt loop. The snap seems secure, but may not be if someone tries to pull the camera case off your belt. The good news is that it is padded enough to prevent damage to the camera, but it is not a hard case."
2,"ok, but I will pass!","It is like an open cover and just fits the camera (nice fit, but not much of padding). It has a small pocket inside which can take a single SD card. You cannot put an extra battery. I found a better leather case (Icon VIN111-BLK) for same price so I am returning this. Also this can only be put on a belt, no shoulder strap. (check the pics I shared)"
2,Panasonic DMW-TZ1KTCP Nylon Camera case for Panasonic TZ1 (Black,Not very practical to carry except to protect the camera. It shoud have a strap to wrap around the belt so that the case does not fall off when you remove the camera.
2,Bad Quality,"The case covers the speakers on the back, lets dust come in very easily, and cracks very, very easily. it's expensive as it is and to have to buy several of them in a month is bad."
3,N-Phase,"This is an early 90's R&B boys band. I liken them to H-Town. The band consists of five members, each one taking the lead at various points. As was usual stuff for these bands, the songs consisted of bedroom tunes, declaration of love for mom, and praise for Jesus. What separates this disc from a lot of others from the same era is the absolute professionalism of the vocals and the quality of production. There are some beautiful songs on here, with clear-as-a-bell singing, wonderful harmonies, and sincere (without being sappy) lyrics. I dare you to listen to ""Oh Baby"", and not think it's the most beautiful song you've heard in the modern R & B era."
1,missing order,"Ordered this cd a month ago and haven't got them yet. I am so not pleased. I would like my money back.. love the group but lost the tape of the lp. Wanted the cd to replace the tape but, haven't got my order and I ordered it a month ago"
5,Sunglasses For Your Camera,"This Neutral Density filter works just the way I expected. It offers a 3 stop reduction in the light entering your lens. I have already given this filter a try and I'm happy with the results.I shoot a lot of portraiture, and I prefer to shoot at f/2.8 to get that silky smooth bokeh in the background. Unfortunately, there are times when I am forced to shoot outdoors on a bright, sunny day. That's when this ND8 filter comes in. When I can't lower my ISO and crank up my shutter speed enough to give me the right exposure at f/2.8, I slap on this baby, and it cuts down just enough light to shoot. Every portrait photographer should keep one of these in their camera bag for this kind of situation."
2,Hoya 52mm 8x ND filter,"I bought this filter for waterfall and long exposure photography, and I have to say I am disappointed with it. It does cut the light by about 3 stops, as advertised, but the photos come out very gray and unsaturated with color, even if I set my camera to Vivid color mode. It also feels much lighter and flimsier in construction than other Hoya filters I own. Consequently I now just use a polarizing filter for the shots that need the reduction in light."
2,Piece of Junk,"I have gone through 4 of these in the last 6 months. It used to be only $6 each so it didnt matter too much (Nextel sells theirs for usually $15-$20). This is a cheap knockoff. But if you are looking for a temporary fix or just dont care how often you replace them, feel free to buy this item. Now that they have raised the price to $10, I'll probably not buy this anymore and get the better one at Nextel."
1,no relief,"Not as effective as most laxatives are. I've used have the bottle and no movement so far. I had to use another product to get some results. Therefore, in my view it is a waste of money."
2,"Submersible yes, but not in water","The lights are easy to install and have a fair price. And you can put them under water with your boat trailer because the bottom is simple open. If water comes in through the opening it also must come out through the opening. Well, it worked one time. The second time one light stopped working. All contacts got so corroded that I even could not change the bulb.I guess the manufacture in china had a different meaning for submersible. Definitely you should not submerse them in water. Look for something sealed!"
3,"Cheap and it works, but...",What I like about this is it has a good ground wire to mate with the chassis. The stock signals that came with my trailer relied on the nut/bolt of the plastic housing and I got intermittent operation. But this has a sound ground wire that mates directly to the chassis. A negative is that the turn-signal lens is not removable. I'm unsure how I will replace the lamp when it burns out. I guess I'll have to dismount the whole unit. I also had trouble getting a good mate with the crimp-style wire lugs. I think the AWG of the wire is too thin for these to work so I went to my tool box and affixed some old-fashioned wire nuts. The license plate mount was too lame so I reused my old one.
4,"Alas, I broke it!","This light kit worked great, until I hit one of the lights with my riding mower. Now, I need another one, which I am now ordering."
2,just a consummer,"One of the bulbs is already not working. The housing look cheap, These lights are not submersible.... DO NOT SUBMERGE THESE LIGHTS!!!! they will rust in 2 days and will cause electrical problems in your car.A little bit better craftmanship can go a long way. We should demand a little bit better quality from chinese products. They can do better. We pay with good currency we should get good products.I plan to place 2 2x4 in the light mounts and raise these lights 2 feet, better visibility and they will be out of the water when you back-up the trailer into the water."
3,Trailer Lights,"Bought these for a rebuilt trailer. They're kind of cheap and flimsy but work okay. A small bump against them and they broke off but I fixed them. One thing I found from other reviews, before getting them wet, use some marine grade silicone to fill the holes in the bottom where the wires come in and along the seams otherwise you'll blow out the bulbs. They're really not that waterproof."
3,not what I wanted,"This is a standard trailer light kit. I wanted a real submersible kit = LED's. I returned this kit because it was standard incandescent lights, and I wanted LED's. Somehow I misread the listing. As a standard, incandescent light kit it was fine, but if you want lights on a trailer that's going to go under water, get an LED light kit. The best I found was the single lights for $16.00 each."
2,"Review from ""My Love Affair With Books""","I wouldn't have come across this book without the Orange Prize nomination. Nelson's Daughter is a very believable portrayal of the scandalous affair between Lord Nelson and Emma Hamilton. This could have been an amazing book, but it completely fell short of its potential.Some of my thoughts about why Nelson's Daughter disappointed me:- Good, in fact a great premise, but weak execution- Too many unnecessary details! At times I felt I was bombarded with facts.- Flat, boring characters. With the exception of Lord Nelson and Emma Hamilton, none of the characters stood out. They were all one-dimensional and very forgettable.- Slow moving. The plot took ages to move forward!It's obvious that the author has researched a lot into the relationship between Nelson and Emma Hamilton. I do appreciate that, but ultimately this book failed to live up to my expectations."
1,AFERN,"THE CARD DECK AND INSTRUCTION BOOK SHOWN IN THE SITE ARE NOT THE ONES THEY SEND ME. THEY SEND ME, A VERY BAD QUALITY PRODUCT AT AN EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE PRICE.I DEFINITELY WANT TO RETURN IT."
2,"great games, misleading system requirements","I've been an avid fan of the Need for Speed series since the beginning. When I saw this bundle being released, I was excited... finally, a chance to play the old classics like NFS II again (as my old version of NFS II didn't seem to run well under a modern operating system).Upon opening the box, I found five discs for all five games, and a small installation booklet. It was here where I read for the first time that four out of the five games in this bundle are supported for Windows 98 only. As in, they didn't ""fix"" any game to work on newer Windows versions. It literally is the same game from years ago.This is mentioned nowhere on the outside of the box, or in Amazon's description. These are still fantastic games and a great bang for the buck (remember each of these titles originally cost $40!), but it is very misleading to sell these items repackaged as a bundle which will not work on the majority of the computers in the world today."
5,This is Awesome.,"I got this about a week after I ordered it. It is so cool. The Porsche Unleashed is easy to drive. Hot Pursuit 2 is very cool. High stakes is cool too. Hot Pursuit 3 has a lot of cool stuff. In SE, the graphics don't look too good, but it is ok. I recommend you get these games. It has a lot of cars and police cars to drive. Hot pursuit 2 has really good graphics."
1,whether one person CAN play it or not is not the issue,"If it says it will work in XP on the box then it should be PATCHED to work in XP whether you CAN play it or not. If it says in the manual that four out of the five games are Win 98 only it should say that on the box. I do not have this I would never buy it, but know for a fact that NS Porshe Unleashed and NS IV do NOT work in XP. I do have those original titles."
1,whoa buddy!,"ok the next time u blame amazon for misleading information u should double check to c if you are correct. if u look undeneath the picture of this 'box set' it clearly states ""Windows 98/ME"". just thought i'd point that out. anyway, i have played all of these games prior to this box set and its definitly not worth your time. if they would have adjusted some of the games, then maybe just maybe this would be worth 24dollars. anywho, if u want a great game go pick up ""NFS: Underground"" by far the greatest racing game out there. other than a more formal ""Nascar Racing 2003 Season""."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this as a gift for someone and I didn't realize the handle would be a flimsy plastic and feels cheap when handled. However the blade part is OK, I just don't like the handle."
3,Not bad,It's a sad commentary on our society that we move from one fad idea to another while clinging to age old problems.I purchase this book because it describes real issues I face in my organization. Whether the book offers any meaningful solutions remains to be seen. It may be an HR book written for HR folks; a group as biased as any I have ever seen!
4,Good enough for a Maltese,"Got this for a family member's Maltese. It was just a tad tight, but not too small. It's about the right size for a small dog. A beagle would have a tough time getting out of this, but for smaller dogs it's fine."
4,"Product is great, shipping not so mcuh",The product is great and exactly what it was described to be. I use it for my cat to fly in. I can't remember who the seller of the carrier was (it was a third party via Amazon) but they were awful when it came to estimated shipping time. It took 2 weeks to be delivered and came the day before I was going to fly. That was a little annoying. I highly recommend the product but buy it from a different seller than the one I used if you expect to get your product in the 5-7 days they advertise.
5,In My Opinion,"Absolutely by far the best book I have ever read on depression. After years of counseling and therapy, nothing came close to the actual reasons for my depression. It hit the nail on the head in describing the way I think, and why it will start the snowball effect of depression! Bravo. I am on my way to good mental health after 48 years."
3,Ding Dong Avon Calling,"I bought this for my 7 year old grandson who is ape about gorillas, however, he was not ape over this book. The illustrations are super, and the storyline great, if you know what a door-to-door salesperson is, and what Hollywood is, and what cosmetics are. The book required many explanations, which took away from the fun that I, as an adult, got from reading the book. Kinda like watching Toy Story. Takes ya back to the good ole days...but kids just don't have a clue."
1,singer sewing machine oil,"This item delayed my order for almost two weeks. Because they did not have it in stock. If it isn't in stock, don't list it. If you find out that it isn't in stock after you already sold it then please contact me and tell me it isn't in. Don't let me sit there and wonder for two weeks why my order isn't coming on time. Needless to say I never received this item therefore I cannot review it."
1,Look elsewhere,"Great material, needs to be redone. When they transferred this to disc from VHS it resulted in a horrible copy that's irritating to even watch. This goes for all 3 discs in the series. I would not recommend this set until it's digitally converted from the analog copy they put on these discs."
2,Mr.Wayne,"This gun aint that hott you get what you pay for it, it charges and all but the battery dies so quickly you really don't want to buy this gun"
2,no power no acuracy,this gun is not even worth the shipping i paid for it. the rifle I bought was way better. but don't buy this gun. it is worth exactly what I paid for it(almost nothing).
1,gun sucks,this gun really sucks. you can shoot yourself in the face and it doesn't even hurt. i had it for like 2 hours and the clip broke so i can't even use it any more. i really would not buy this gun.
1,WORST GUN EVER!,"I bought two of these, it took the idiots at HobbyTron 2 weeks to ship it. Only one worked when I recieved them, hobbytron doesn't respond to my emails. Magazines are terrible! If you load more than 4 BB's the spring shoots up and they fly all over! The laser sight is completly off. The gun uses 4 AAA batteries, which gives you about 20 shots. The guns jam right away, waste of money!"
5,Great work and casual boots,"These Matterhorn boots are comfortable, waterproof, and well constructed. I compared a lot of other boots, these were well styled for the work boot category. They are simple in design and very practical. I love the Gore Tex for waterproofing. They have served me well in this cold, snowy Chicago winter."
3,Not bad but not the best,I used these for about 4 months to work out on the heavy bag before they started to go flat. For the price thats about all I expected from them. Lasted longer than the same basic style Century brand gloves I had which tore open after 2 weeks of use. They work good for sparring when your just playing around because they're so padded they dont hurt that much when you get hit. They work but i'd reccomend the Everlast pro style training gloves instead. Theyre more firm and hold up longer plus offer better wrist support. Overall though these aren't bad.
3,Not bad but a little bulky,These things are kinda cheesy when you look at them and try them on. They are totally huge on my hands and look like clown gloves or something. They are good for sparring around or playing around with friends and siblings though.
3,kind of good,"this boxing glove is very old but still has good quality,i never used this glove but i know that EVERLAST has very good quality equipment(i dont know if i spelled that right.) the reason i give this only 3 stars is because EVERLAST has better gloves that they make besides this one."
5,I WOULD GIVE THIS GAME A 999999999999999!,"Even if you are not a fan of rpg games, ... It is really fun. I bought my golden sun (the first one) like 2 years ago, and I always start a new game and keep on playing it till this day...so it gotta be fun... and now golden sun 2 you go on a glorious adventure you get to fly, surf in boats, go to diffirent continents, fight diffirent monsters and get Djjiins. The game will take to 50 hours WITHOUT using cheats or going on gamefaqs cause then theres no fun in it. Use cheats after you beat the game like I always do...."
5,Good RPG but one flaw,"Golden Sun 2 is the best GBA RPG out there! Graphics are good, story is good but the deal is when your guys start talkin, they talk forever and usually u don't know where you have to go! I recommend it though, you should play the first one though before this for reasons I ain't listing"
4,One of the greatest games of all time,"golden sun the lost age is one of the best games of all time.This game cotinues on from the first game golden sun.*graphics 10/10*music(i have no idea because i played this game with the music turned off)*gameplay 10/10*challenging 10/10this game is one of those games that makes your heart beat faster and faster just wanting to know more about the plot.This game is pretty challenging you'll have to train your characters an awfully lot becuse the bosses are pretty hard,but not to hard that it will make you want to quit the game and have nothing more to do with it.This game deserves 5 stars if i could give it more i would."
4,Its ok on its own,"I found the game to be pretty good on its own, meaning not owning the original Golden Sun game. I missed out on the first and now I can't purchase it besides second hand, and after playing this one I intend to do just that. The story kind of kicks in a little bit before the end of the first game I think and basically you start with a bunch of level 1 characters so it IS a new game only expanding on the original's story. Overall its highly playable and easy to get into. I'm on my second game now trying to complete it."
5,This game is tight,"Man, this game is awesome! I had a tough time for a long time with this. I finally figured it out and it has been fun. I have had this game about 1 year and it still has not got old. This is a must have for RPG fans or just game fans in general!"
5,Felix Is Fun!,"Well,it finally came out. Golden Sun 2 for GBA.The games graphics are much better than the old one, and the # of monster battles inside places like caves has gone down to just the right out amount. If you beat the first GS and saved your clear data,this is where it comes in handy. You can use a password or link up both games to transfer a powered up party to your GS2. As soon as the game boy adapter for gamecube comes out, people will be buying this and that so they can play on the big screen. So if you like role playing games, and love golden sun, you should buy now!"
4,the best game!,"in my opinion this is the best game for the GBA it has great sound is very challenging has great graphics is very fun to play and has a ton of replay value. Do not buy this if you have not played and beeten the first one but trust me and i have like 20 games this is well worth your money, will keep you busy for a while and is without a doubt the game of the year if not the best GBA game ever! So go and buy it right now or I will track you down, take your money and buy it for you. I'm serious."
1,did not receive,the game itself is fantastic but the seller i would not recommend i ordered the game quite some time ago i never received it and the seller did not reply to e-mail
3,THE WIZ KID IS HERE,HI everybody well im back the wiz kid and i played the first part of this terffic game. I would give this game 5 stars but i dont now yet how the game would be like. The first part was great good fighting good grahcis what more you want o yea and good story line. i will reset the stars when i get to play this game in japan or in english.
4,Excellent sequel.,"While this is the 2nd Golden Sun game, it is not so much a sequel as it is a continuation of the first game.The story pretty much continues right where the first game left off and you are benefited greatly if youve played through the first game before hand.You can carry over your characters if you have a save from the first game and this is the only way to get the best summons in the game.The summons, or pokemon, are what make this game so much fun and they are absolutely beautiful to watch.Though the puzzles in this game are about 500% more complex than the first game, the enemy fights are still way too easy.Oh well...In the end this is still a tremendous rpg and will last you quite some time... both games combined took me 56+ hours.And while the game is lots of fun, it is still not perfect due to its ridiculously long dialogue parts.But the pluses easily outweight the minuses and this is still one of the top 3 rpgs available on the Gameboy."
4,will be the best,"ok before u buy this game buy golden sun cuz it the continuation of the first. in this one you can combine different elemental dijin for even greater summons.The Lost Age will be far more expansive than that of the first game, and players will have the ability to meet and join parties of other characters, with party members coming and going as the story progresses. the graphics are brigther and better that the first and there is even a feature to upload your old data via link cable or passwords. wouldn't u like to know what happened to jenna, felix karadin and sheba. would they reach lumeria? stop wondering and buy this game its greater than the first."
4,Great old games.,"With this game and it's predecessor Golden Sun, I'm reliving my high school years playing these immensely fun games. I'm also glad to have a DS Lite so that once this installment is complete I can move into the third iteration Golden Sun: Dark Dawn."
5,As Golden as the First,"This game is even better than the first, though you don't need to have played the original, as it provides you with a decent recap of events.With more djinn, more customizations, spells, items, and longer game time, this is one of my favorite RPGs of all time. The story takes some new twists and turns as you play as the characters you were chasing after in the first Golden Sun. The game picks up where the original left off and is very enjoyable all the way to the end, and a lot of the motivations of the original characters are finally revealed. You can also transfer character data from the original game which will get you access to the secret dungeon if you've got all the djinn.If you've played the first to the end and still haven't played this, by all means get it and have fun. You won't be disappointed."
3,Chapter on WW II ruins entire book,"I was very impressed with this entire book right up until the chapter on WW II and Hitler's germany. I felt that he completely changed the tone of his entire argument and then put forth a reasoning that was both faulty and vague. He make sure that the reader knows that Hitler is not the only one to blame for the failure of Germany to win WW II. He then jumps from idea to idea on why germany lost the war, going from the general staff was as much for the operations as Hitler, to modern technology had made the independence of command model obsolete and that the economy and german society as a whole was not made to be involved in a war that was this long. He flits from each of these reasons and never has a coherent and well thought out argument in any of them. I read so many glowing reviews on this book and just had to post my own thoughts on it. please feel free to comment on this review."
4,"A Good Study, Would Have Liked More","The Weakness of Robert M. Citino's ""The German Way of War: From the Thirty Years' War to the Third Reich"" is its limited scope. Citino makes so many good points but never really puts them to the test. Case in point his handling of Barbarossa, in which he expertly lays out the problems faced by the Wehrmacht, bad intelligence, poor logistics, overconfident political leadership, etc... before detailing this one German campaign. The reader would like to see his theories put to the test in other WWII campaigns like Blau and Citadel. In his defense the book is not simply a look at the Wehrmacht in World War II, but a more comprehensive view of the evolution of German war-making. In many regards this book is a success, but one is left feeling a little cheated by the lack of examples."
3,Review of German miltary operation,"I appreciated this items for summary of German military operation for past several hundred years.especially WWI and WWII, in short German war doctrine is lively and short war.But only disadvantage is lack of organization studies on German army in each period"
4,No title,"Unfortunately, I have no comments pertaining to this purchase at this time. It was bought as a Christmas gift, and has not yet been given to the intended recipient."
3,Slumming,"Sam, Nikki, and Alicia are all senior, and have come up with a project, to help them branch out and "" repay their debt to society"". They will each pick one person "" in need of help"" i.e; the goth, the nerd, the druggie, and recreate their image, then take them to prom. As the book goes on, it gets less and less about the original idea, and Sam, Nikki, and Alicia grow to actually like the people they choose.They form true friendships, and grow farther and farther apart from each other. They realize that there is much more to people than meets the eye. There are consiquences to these friendships though, they are faced with many difficult decisions, and in the end, they become much closer becuase of them.I enjoyed this book, not your typical "" makeover"" story. Towards the end it drags out a little bit, but other than that I recomend it."
4,Excellent source,"This is the best Ogam book that I have found. A must have for Druid studies, and Celtic culture."
5,A MUST FOR ANY BRAT FAN!,"I'm a huge fan of Da Brat, and I love this video. It shows all her videos from the Funkdafied album, and also interviews, behind the scene stuff, her platinum party, and more. I really enjoyed this video. It brought me back to 1994 when Funkdafied was out and me and all my friends knew ALL of the words to it. Those were the days!"
3,Outsiders Guide to Jamaica,"I recently purchased this book, with high expecatations. It has a good 'grass roots' theme of Jamaica. A more intimate look at Jamaica, but don't look to buy this book if you plan to stay in the tourist district. There isn't much substance to find for tourists, but if your looking for a 'locals guide' this is the book for you."
3,Not as helpful as I wished,"I purchased this book for my sister in law who is visiting Jamaica this year. I read through the book after recieving it and was a little disappointed. It did not offer as much helpful info as I had wished. Some of the info it offered I didn't think was very applicable. Not a bad book, just wish I purchased a different one."
1,"Horrible, outdated guide book",This was written about 4 or 5 years ago. Most phone numbers are out of date. I had a very bad experience when trying to use this guide book and hope you can find something better.
4,Very good resource.,"Stayed at an all inclusive so I was a bit hesitant on whether or not I would like this book. The book makes specific mention that they do not cover all inclusives. Anyway, I still found this book to be very insightful and knowledgeable of the surrounding land, sights, history, and insider tips. Thought the chapter on how Jamaica came to be very worthwhile. If it helps, I also bought the Moon book on Jamaica but turned to this one much more frequently. Definitely worth a look if considering a guide book."
1,Biased guide. Consider Lonely Planet...,"I am pretty disappointed with this book. Because of author's negative thoughts on all-inclusive resorts, there is no reviews of these resorts. These resorts even does not exist on the local maps in the books while other resorts exist. If you are considering a balanced review, I would recommend to buy other guides like Lonely Planet."
5,Invaluable guide,"This book was absolutely indispensable on my first trip to the fascinating island of Jamaica. All sections of the island are thoroughly covered, including recommendations for lodging, restaurants, and the multitude of places to visit.This is a must-buy guide to anyone traveling to Jamaica for the first time or the tenth."
3,Not too bad,"Just got this today, it shaves the ice pretty well. My complaint is the cup that it spits the ice into. It's odd shaped, not really convenient for getting shaved ice out of. It's long and narrow, kinda like a skinny kidney pan, but about 8 inches deep. A bowl with a large opening or the ability to put your glass directly under it would have been nice. Overall, a good product."
3,Appliance worked well for one summer's worth of snow cones...,"...but poor performance, as in nearly unusable, this year. Ice cubes no longer make adequate contact with blade without stopping the motor several times to give unit a shake.The ice shaving's discharge chute and collection cup are poorly designed. Shavings must be plunged continually into cup as the unit runs; otherwise, the shavings clog the chute.Replacement blade is unavailable from Rival and after-market, third-party suppliers. Who needs another throw-away appliance?Cost: $15 on clearance @ WallyWhirld. IMO, not worth a penny more, considering its poor performance."
1,Wish I'd kept the receipt,"This worked well for a week or two. Now it freezes up (no pun intended) after it shaves only a couple of cubes. Although it has a pour spout, it is impossible to pour the shaved ice into a cup from the container without making a mess. I'd take it back, but I threw away the receipt."
4,Nice snow cone machine for the price,"I expected this to shave ice very thin, but it doesn't. It's more like snow cone consistency, which was fine with me. I purchased this cause it was less expensive than a snow cone machine, even though I wanted snow cone consistency ice, so if you are looking for fine shaved ice, this is not the machine for you. It's a bit strange to have to have the lid on and be ready to go before you plug it in (only because I was used to the one where you hold the lid down to shave the ice). Some people complained about the hopper to catch the ice as it is small and narrow. You can take it off and just hold your glass under it to catch the ice and it's great! It fills up one large glass. I put the hopper back in place afterwards to catch the drips and I don't have to drain it. It's a very pretty machine, and I think a fair deal for the price."
4,without rival,"My wife bought me this as a father's day gift 2 years ago. After 2 years it still works as good as ever. Its greatest feature is that it uses regular, everyday. ice cubes from your freezer. No special molds that you need to fill and freeze. Some guys like to relax after a long day at work with a cold beer, not me. To me, there is nothing better than a snow cone. So my ice shaver has gotten some heavy use over the years. Especially when I have a party, guests of all ages love it.My only complaint is the collection bowl for the shaved ice. It is rather odd shaped, and the ice tends to accumulate in the middle under the blade. You have to stop and empty the collection bowl often. Of course, I use a 32oz cup. If you where making 8oz snow cones like a normal person I'm sure it would not be an issue."
4,A good theory on homosexuality,"This seems a very good theory on homosexuality and could make a lot of sense to many of us. Its main point is that homosexuality is the result of our own personality and traits, in interaction with our father and mother in our early years. It is a very logical and plausible theory of homosexuality development. However, the author rests in the realm of especulation and anecdotical evidence without giving any robust and lasting support to his case."
5,The Battle for Normality: Self-Therapy for Homosexual Persons,"This is an excellent book, for everyone who is interested in facts and science rather than ideologies. A great help for those who seek help with homosexual feelings."
3,"Good Overview, If Overtly Religious","Some of the virtues of this book are that it is short (can be read in one to two sittings), and gives a very good overview of the causes & cures for homosexuality. A negative, at least from my perspective, is that the author is overtly religious in his delivery and some of his approaches to treatment. As an agnostic I sometimes felt this religious overtone off putting...Afterall, I do not see homosexuality as inherently or morally bad, I simply have come to believe that for me at least, it is not the path to long term happiness. This book would probably work best for someone who is already of a religious (preferably catholic) persuasion. However, the underlying psychological theories and approaches to treatment are good sound advice for most readers struggling with UNWANTED homosexual feelings."
1,Damaging Literature,"This book is a perfect example of the antiquated ideals of Freud. We no longer live in a repressive, 19th century culture where gender is prescribed into the social role one must play. This book is incredibly damaging when it comes to viewing ""homosexuality"" as a disorder.The main diagnosis of homosexuality as a ""neurotic disorder"" is itself flawed. Neurosis is a medical diagnosis that has fallen out of the medical lexicon because it is vague, often baseless and almost impossible to support scientifically. This book is largely filled with empty, pseudo-Christian rhetorical doctrine that is unfortunately self-reinforcing. I can't wait until this falls out of publication."
1,"This is a collossally destructive, myopic, and inhumane","Two things this books seems to overlook: First, homosexuality is genetic and biological in origin. Second, there's nothing actually wrong with homosexuals. From a religious perspective, note that most mainline churches are now increasingly accepting of homosexuals, including Congregational, Anglican, Lutheran, among others. So if you are encountering religious difficulties with homosexuality: change your denomination. Try any of these books as a starting point instead:Stealing JesusRescuing the Bible from FundamentalismComing Out of ShameOuting YourselfGood luck--and don't waste your money on this destructive book."
1,Another Quack Making a Buck Selling A Book,"Yet another psychobabble specialist who, lacking any other topic that sells to desparate people, decides to pontificate about homosexuals to make a buck selling books."
1,Boring,I managed to skim through this book in less than an hour. I bought it mainly to see what he had to say. My feeling is he took parts of what all Homoseuals feel and then used those feeling to justify his views. He used the same old tired lines that all anti-gay pepople use. He provides no Therapy for Homosexuals.
1,Don't fall prey to this propaganda,"Don't fall prey to this propaganda like I did. If you read books like this and follow their advice, your life will be monstrously painful and in all likelihood you'll contemplate suicide more than you ever have. It's easy, isn't it, to want to be ""normal,"" i.e. to be straight. But if you're gay, you just can't be. You'll be happier in the long run to stay clear of this kind of garbage--take it from the voice of experience. Other people who reviewed this book have noted ""Outing Yourself"" as a good resource--buy that book and start there, instead. There is no reason why you can't have a fulfilling, meaningful life as an out gay person--and religion can be a part of that, too, if need be. But don't waste your time searching for something that can never be: You're gay; be proud!"
1,An unscientifc and pretencious book that does no good !,"It seems that most critisism against homosexuality comes from the Christian corner of society. Therefore it is especially sad that someone who has a ""Ph.D."" in his title is hiding his true religious prejudice before a mask of science. There is no cure for it, because it is not a disorder - any Christian who personally knows gays or lesbians AND uses his brain to think about it recognizes that. Please don't buy this book ! It is a threat to young gay people who are still unsure about their own being homosexual. By the way: To be gay and to believe in God is no contradiction. I live with it very well and thousands of other gays too - just think of all the homosexual priests ! Jesus is fun, but love, too."
1,Not worth the money!,"The book is too oriented to domestic US soils, and the aproach is superficial and over-simplified. The amount of useful information is less than 5% of the huge size of the volume. Really a waste of money."
5,The Author Responds,"What divergent opinions !! Naturally I think the book is loaded with practical geotechnical information, including tons of solved problems. Give the book a chance and decide for yourself. Many thanks to my supporters...."
5,WONDERFUL BOOK FOR STRENGTH,THIS IS A WONDERFUL BOOK. VERY SHORT CHAPTERS FOR SELF IMPROVEMENT AND CONFIDENCE. I HAVE GIVEN THIS BOOK AWAY AS GIFTS TO SEVERAL VERY DEAR FEMALE FRIENDS.
1,Faulty discs,"I ordered two of these and both are defective. They keep stopping and stopping, making it unwatchable. I loved this series and wish I could download it from somewhere to avoid the defective discs."
5,moonlighting strangers who just met on the way,I love this show. And I love Bruce Willis. He and Cybil made it work. The show was the bomb and it is still today.
3,"Good DVDs, so-so show","The DVDs are very good quality and even the ripping to iPod MP4 format is smooth with no hiccups. That said, I forgot how irritating the constant bickering between the two lead characters is! I must have been much more tolerant in my teens watching this show, but it really grates on me now. I don't think I can stomach more than one season of 'Moonlighting'. I still vote 'Remington Steele' as my all-time favourite TV show from the 80's -- the relationship between the two lead characters is much more comfortable."
4,Moonlighting,"One of the best television series ever produced. Funny, well written, great characters, made this show one of my all time favorites. It's worth watching simply to see Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd interacting."
3,an old favorite,"I have no problem with the delivery or condition etc. of my purchase. My only problem is with human nature. What I once considered a witty, original show has now become a bit corny and overacted by today's standards. My wife and I watched the first two episodes and have not been back since.The problem may be that some series were made to be seen once per week, anything more gets to be an overdose."
2,Difficult to watch,"Some programs belong in the memory and should not be watched again, the ""me, me, me"" was very hard to watch especially 2 seasons."
2,The Big Smirk,"I watched Moonlighting when it first aired but i didn't remember a single episode except for the black-and-white one, and that's mainly because it was so over-hyped at the time. Generally the show is over-written and performed, and it never stops smirking."
5,Beginning of it all,"I was a fan of the show since the beginning.How unique the show was. Just because of the characters Maddie & David & how the show was written.We did NOT really care about the case for the week, we cared about the characters. How the characters were written & how the behaved is what brought we fans to the show week after week.Course, we can go into the later seasons when none of the seasons had the normal.The banter between the characters. A totally 1980's show. The music. The woman's clothesOK, let's get technical. The chases & stunts. NOT a good job with the stunt people looking like the characters. But, you remembered the chases because the were funny.The quotable lines.Oh the DVD releases, this is the best of the 5 seasons.Best extras. Commentary on some episodes & 3 other extras.Cameos from future celebrities, look for those as the show goes on."
5,Moonlighting,In my ordering career with both Amazon and Ebay--I have NEVER received an ordered product any faster. It arrived within 36 hours after placing the order.Outstanding company to work with.
5,"Some Walk By Night, Some Fly By Day..........","I never thought I would be hearing the original theme song again. I NEVER missed an episode of Moonlighting, NEVER! It was a well written show that did not get enough mention. Even with today TV, few shows can be put on the same level as Moonlighting. This show is a must have and is long overdue. And for those of you who haven't had the pleasure of seeing Maddie Hayes & David Addison (Cybil Shepard & Bruce Willis respectively) in action, Get the DVD, pop some popcorn, press play and wait until you here, ""Some Walk By Night, Some Fly By Day...."" Enjoy!"
5,One of the Greatest Shows Ever,Truly a show ahead of its time in it's off-beat humor and great chemistry between the lead actors. It has almost no rival in the latter department. Desperately waiting for season #3 and Taming of the Shrew....
2,"Great Show, Awful Box Set","For whatever reason the manufacturer of this product didn't think that the case should actually hold the DVDs. So you open it like a book and the plastic inserts holding the discs just fall out. It's like they merged two styles of box sets, but only the parts that would be completely incompatible. The worst I have ever seen.Five star show. One star set."
4,Why do they do it?,"I was and still am a huge Moonlighting fan and it is because I loved the show so much that I noticed something in one of my favorite episodes that ruined the scene. ""Lady in the Iron Mask"" had one of the classic chase scenes of all time. Originally during that scene, the music being played is ""The William Tell Overture"" ( otherwise known as the Hopalong Cassidy theme ). Perfectly timed, the scene was hilarious. They had some other music playing and I know it sounds stupid, but it wasn't as funny. I watched the episode I had taped on VHS and what a difference. I cannot understand why they felt the need to tamper with perfection.The rest of the DVD is good. I didn't care for the disc holders, they are kind of cheap looking, and the discs are not clearly marked. You need a magnifying glass to read them. The extras are great and of course the episodes are wonderful. I will forgive them there errors, the show is as funny as ever. It has definitely stood the test of time."
4,romance comedy,"This is a wonderful show to watch with someone special,I got it free with my pepsi points."
5,At Long Last,"Moonlighting was one of the most clever and stylish shows on television. I am so thrilled that it is finally available on DVD. The chemistry between Cybill Shephard and Bruce Willis is unmatched, which is odd considering the rumors that befell them regarding their apparent strife behind the scenes. This discord is not apparent watching the episodes, in which their chemistry is phenomenol.The physical comedy in Moonlighting simply doesn't exisit in today's television programs. The writing is quite humorous and the supporting cast is genuinely talented. Even the storylines surrounding the supporting cast members are enjoyable.All in all, a fantastic show and a welcome addition to my DVD collection."
4,A blast from the past,"This was actually a requested Christmas present for my 13 year old who had seen repeats on television and thought it was good. I caught it first time around when it was new and different, there really wasn't anything like that on TV. My son loves it but cannot believe the shoulder pads and the big hair; did we really dress like that?? Not to mention Bruce Willis with hair! If it's 80s nostalgia you're looking for, then this is the one for you."

4,Cool Workbook,"I purchased this book for our 3 years old, and was glad to have bought this. There are a lot of different games in the book, which our son enjoys. I have to be involved since he cannot read just yet, but after a while, he knows just what to do on some of the games, even without my supervision.This is a cool book because there are enough games here that keep my son out of boredom."
2,Increíble,"El libro trata de una arqueóloga (Sharon) que encuentra un esqueleto y piensa que es de Cristo, entonces del Vaticano mandan a un cura (Jim) para que verifique si es cierto o no, después de meses de investigación, Jim y Sharon se enamoran y pasa lo que tiene que suceder cuando dos personas se enamoran, durante la investigación de los huesos aparece un agente de la KGB el cual Jim no conoce y le dice a Jim que se robe los huesos y además que su amante es una espía, lo increíble es que Jim le cree sin decir nada. Al final el libro mismo dice que es una novela sin bases reales, no vale la pena perder el tiempo en este libro.Si quieren leer un buen libro del mismo tema lean El Código Da Vinci de Dan Brown."
3,Necessary when painting but not made well,Excellent for finger painting and and other arts and crafts projetcs but not made well. The seams did not hold up very well and I had to re-sew them more than 5 times in one year.
1,AM I AN ONLY TWIN?,"The comedy is slapstick and juvenile. Nathan has multiple personality disorders, all of which makes him act like The Stooges, although it wasn't really funny. There is some sex parody scenes that didn't work well either. Nathan manages to leave the mental institution and make it to his twin brother's house where no one, including his wife can tell them apart. The humor is old and stale. Tracy Lords looks sweet in a maid's outfit, but we've seen her looking better. Not worth the price of a rental. Avoid, unless you are extremely immature.No f-bombs, no nudity, no real sex."
2,JUST BLAND,"can't say I'm surprised by the glowing reviews of this disc but for me it's just bland and faceless smooth jazz. This could be anybody. It's a generic sounding CD that fails to distinguish itself from the pack. I actually have another Boney James CD and I enjoyed that but this one falls very flat for me. No fire or enough passion. Just very easy going smooth jazz for people who don't want to think too much. If it works for you then fine, I'll pass."
5,Boney's best,"If only he still made music like this - smooth, catchy, happy... My favorite song of all time is ""Just Between Us"", a catchy duet that demonstrates a conversation between 2 people. ""Happy Home"" is an amazing vocal that doesn't allow the vocals to drown out his sax playing. The rest of the album is uplifting and fun. Please, Boney, bring it back to days like this!"
5,The Funkiest Smooth Jazz on The Planet,"I am a Smooth Jazz fanatic. But Boney James takes care of all my music needs. This album in particular is one of my favorites. It has everything. Something sweet and mellow. Something for your night moods or that special ""We want to alone date"". Funky jazz that will get you on your feet. I play Boney during my dinner party's and everyone always asks, Hey who's that on the box? If you've never experienced Boney James, this is the one to check out. You have my word, you'll buy everything he puts out."
5,The epitome of sensual jazz,"""Backbone"" is by far one of the sexiest and most sensual CD's I have ever heard. Every track drips with emotion and the song ""Blue"" is a veritable musical aphrodisiac. ""Backbone"" should be in everyone's Smooth Jazz collection."
5,Backbone,"Excellent, Boney James has done it again. For those jazz lovers, its a must have CD. Like all the previous CD's, Boney has a way to move you while you listen to his music. This, like every other cd, sets the mood for enjoyment, and lots of loving."
3,"A Good 1st Air Rifle, but move on quickly from here.","Think of this rifle as like the piece of junk M-16 you had back in Basic Training. This rifle is practically perfect as a training tool for a 1st-time shooter. However, once the shooter has learned all the safety procedures and is focused on learning the finer points of marksmanship fundamentals this rifle will quickly prove to be a disappointment. Unlike a Daisy BB gun, this is a true rifle, so I think it is a much better value than a 'Red Rider'."
4,Kicks and Hits like a mule!!!,"Extremely powerful rifle. Much more than I expected. It kicks when you pull the trigger and delivers a pellet with incredible velocity. It takes a lot of getting used to as it is a solid and heavy rifle which isn't easy to keep steady. With the weight and the kick it takes a lot of practice, muscle, and effort to keep it accurate. It tends to shoot high of the target as when the trigger is pulled it creates incredible inertia. Easy to use but must be handled with care and safety---it is NOT a toy!!!"
5,BUY,"GREAT GUN!!!!! buy this!!!! let me tell you i had this thing for a day and its great,,,all metal and woood no plastin well built and woth the money,, if un gunna buy it buy it now,,,, theres one left"
5,Chinese air rifle,"You can't go wrong for the price! Rifle looks nice and is suprisingly powerful and accurate. This rifle is built like a tank! Feels solid due to its metal and wood construction. It is a heavier weight rifle and doesnt feel like a cheap plastic kids toy. After a couple of adjustments of the rear sight, I was hitting pop cans out to 100 feet with no problems. I own another high power rifle which I paid over 5 times the price of this one, and find myself reaching for this one 90% of the time. I only wish the company would offer this rifle in .22 caliber as well. Would definitely buy both! There are also many forums online you can visit for care, tuning, and upgrading this style of air gun. All around fun little rifle."
2,Great for the money...BUT...,"...you I cannot find parts for this thing. I have searched the internet to no avail.It worked for about 500 to 1000 shots then something broke inside that did not allow the spring to be compressed. I took it apart and found it had a broken plastic part that went into and held the spring in place. Very fixable...if you could find parts. If anyone knows where you can find parts for this thing, I would appreciate the notification. Otherwise, if you buy this, consider it a disposable gun if anything breaks.To bad because overall it was a nice gun for the money."
1,it was good but the cit went downhill,at first it was an amazing rifle for the first couple of days i was having a blast shotting it but then i noticed the power of the rifle began going down and the lever stopped working and i got angry
3,play gun,This air rifle is not what i thought it would be. It works fine and is good for a beginner . It just does not have the power that I needed. I believe the fps is about 450 and I needed a 1200 fps air rifle..It is heavy duty and is a great beginning gun for a young lad. It is accurate and fun to shoot. Just not what I needed. It is a great price.
1,Popped before I even used it,"I put it into the tire and inflated it, but before I could even install the wheel on the bike the tube popped inside the tire. There was green ooze everywhere. I don't recommend this, get something better."
3,So far so good,"After going through a cheaper tube in about a week, I was ready to try anything. So far this tube has lasted over a month of fairly heavy use. I know there is always a luck element involved, but I'm not exactly inclined to go poke a hole in the tube to see if it seals itself or not."
4,Not pleased,These slime tubes are very good. However when i did the front tired on my mountain bike i and a blow out within the first week. I had never ridden the bike. Amazon did replace it and i have not had any problems since.
2,Bad,"Slime would get into the valve, rendering the tube unusable. After tired of it constantly leaking air thru the slimed valve, I decided to replace it and had to cut out the valve stem, but that was not enough. Then I had to puncture the tube with a screwdriver just to get it off my rim."
2,Doesn't Work,"I've always been leery of these tubes... my local bike shop swears by them so I had them installed ... I have a cannondale mountain bike & first ride I get a flat... I check the tube & the stem had separated, I go to shop they replace for free next week a thin nail pops it ... I pump up the tire & spin the tire so the slime can coat it & goes flat... The slime itself is too watery to stop anything but the most microscopic leak, this tube is not worth the more expensive price just does not work period....nothing against this seller though... Shipment was prompt"
3,"Slime 26"" SV Thorn Resistant Thick Smart tube 26 x 1.75-2.125 (Schrader Valve)",I am sure this tube will be durable because it it at least three times as thick and heavy as a standard tube.On the other hand this because of the added weight may not be in your best interest.I also had trouble filling one of the two I purchased.I had to remove the schrader valve and clean the coagulated slime from the valve in order to fill the tube.
2,not for me,"this tube is heavy!!! the added thickness and the slime really packs on some weight to your bike. i didnt think i would notice it but i used to haul my bike up a pretty decent flight of stairs multiple times a day and i got really used to the weight... needless to say when i put these tubes in, i really noticed a difference. not so much when riding though, as i didnt jump around and things like that. the slime in side clogged the valve so when it was time to ship my bike back home i had to cut the tire off. but the are nice tubes and i doubt they will leak or get punctured... they're just not for me."
3,This is too big to carry with you,Don't expect to carry this as a spare in your bike bag. The box is 9 x 4.5 x 2.5 and weighs 1.75 pounds. I'll have to get something else and leave this on the shelf in my garage.
5,No flats for me,"I ride 5 1/2 miles a day each way to work and really do not have a place where I could safely stop if I had a flat tire. I bought these tubes to provide the best protection I can get for my bike. I have seen plenty of other bikers with flats and pushing their bikes, not for me."
3,Weak link of the Axis,"This is quite a good title which brings some light on the Italian Army, the weak link of the Axis powers. The Italian Army was often derided as being ineffective. It never had the reputation of being efficient like the Wehrmacht nor of being ruthless like the Japanese army. But this book helps to set the record straight and shows that when well led, Italians fought extremely well in Africa. The only disappointment are the illustrations. Though the uniforms are well drawn, the artist has used the same face for most of the figures. This face is almost caricatural and does a disfavour to the book's general presentation."
4,The Italian Army 1940-45 {2} Africa 1940-1943,"The second of Jowett and Andrew's series on the Italian Army during the second world war, this volume is much like the first. The campaign narratives are especially interesting, and include orders of battle {for the Italians}, as well as nicely illustrated rank insignia charts. Narratives on the uniforms and equipment are brief and not very comprehensive, and the illustrations are composites from photographs and basically copied from the first volume. 48 pages in length, it's a good reference for the beginning military historian or collector."
4,A Nice Beginning,"The photographic record in this book is just stunning, and I am greatful to have SOMETHING about the Ottoman Navy. Unfortunately, except for the photos, there is little that is not available in something like Conway's - I wish there had been more on design histories - WHY did the Ottomans order these ships, and what was the thinking behind their designs? I hope that the authors are planning a follow-up volume."
2,Okay but not pleasant,"""Deconstructing Beck"" is a semi-legal release where such people as ""Corporal Blossum"" and ""Spacklequeen"" blend many Beck songs into 13 tracks. The results mostly sound like flipping a radio dial and at over over 50 minutes, the album runs a bit too long."
2,Interesting but not-too-pleasant,"""Deconstructing Beck"" is basically a bunch of people with names like ""Corporal Blossum"" and ""Mr. Meridies"" fading in and out a lot of Beck songs. At over 50 minutes an album that sounds like a person flipping a radio dial gets a little boring."
1,Bad,"Disappointed that it didn't have any bass and that it didn't even sound as loud as my old speaker. They didn't even fit right in my car when I installed them, I wasn't able to use the housing that was in the car door so I just screwed it onto the door panel. Most likely lose a lot of sound that way too."
4,good speaker,"What I expected from Infinity. High quality, great sounding speaker. For the price, you can't go wrong. Tweeter angle is not adjustable like the Kappas."
4,Quality speakers.,"***4.5 stars***These speakers sound really good, especially for some dinky little 4"" speakers. I heard some other 4""ers in a stereo shop too and these were the best, besides the infinity 4"" kappas. I'm not claiming to have heard all of the 4"" speakers out there, but I do know that infinity makes a really good speaker and I'm happy with these. BUUUUUUUT... IF you can fit them, the larger infinity speakers sound SO much better. I had the 6022i 6.5"" speakers in my old car but couldn't fit the same ones in my new car or darn sure I would have. These are good speakers but the same series infinity 6.5's will stomp the hell out of these. I really miss the low frequency that I used to have with the 6022i's, it makes a big difference."
4,2003 Camry Bank 1 Sensor 1,This product was slightly different (longer wiring). It is an A/F sensor for bank 1 sensor 1 on a 2003 Camry V6. The B1S1 sensor is located on the firewall side. the product arrived earlier then stated and fit perfectly. so far I am impressed. I would recommend taking the old sensor out first and attempt to match it to the same type sensor.
4,PReb.com comenta:,"Luis Negrón Hernandez: El por muchos años periodista de El Mundo y The San Juan Star, Alex W. Maldonado, aporta a nuestra historiografía: Teodoro Moscoso and Puerto Rico's Operation Bootstrap. Moscoso, a cargo de la promoción industrial de Puerto Rico a partir de la década del 1940, junto a otros extraordinarios tecnócratas, contribuyó como pocos al desarrollo y futuro de Puerto Rico. Lea cómo lo hicieron."
2,An epic depiction of Moscoso's achievements and failures.,"This political biography of Teodoro Moscoso, the brain behind Operation Bootstrap, straddles between epical and history. Moscoso is presented as a hero who singlehandedly transformed Puerto Rican history. Moscoso's failures as U.S. ambassador to Venezuela and Director of the Alliance for Progress are presented as fatefull events out of his control.Well written but too bent on presenting Moscoso as a hero, rather than as an actor of history, the book becomes a one sided apology rather than a balanced political biography."
5,Great presentation of the history and evolution...,"Maldonado opened with his book one of Puerto Rican history important moments, operation boostrap. To my generation Operation Bootstrap (Manos a la Obra) seems as something so far in time, but in reading Maldonados book I understand how this economic changes shape the lives of my family and therefore in the longrun me. Maldonado achieve to expose all the different aspect of the operation and all the problems it confroted. Maldonado proves is objectivity by recognizing the mistakes that were made and how they have influenced outcome events. I really recommended this book."
3,This is average,"This is an average recording. I would say that Prince's music is not suited for this type of performance. Nice try, but let's let Prince do the music. After all, he's the master."
1,Dud,"Never thought I'd have to day that about a Zippo, but I got a ""bad one"". The lid doesn't snap shut quite right, I had to adjust the flint as soon as I got it so it would spark, and I'm not sure if it's the wick or what, but if just won't light. Takes maybe 20 tries."
4,Awesome,"This was for my theatre acting 1 class, i really enjoyed that class and this book. It has very interesting activities"
1,Sadly simplistic and juvenile,"The art of playwriting is lost here. In its place is boiled down stuff that seems, um, ""borrowed"" and condensed from the much better books. If the author is aiming at 8th grade kids, perhaps it works, but one thinks even they deserve more respect. For anyone else, disappointingly juvenile. From the way it is hyped I thought I could use it in a workshop, as well as for myself, but it won't serve. I selected another book (also on Amazon) for those purposes and we're all happy. Sorry, Mr. Cassady."
4,insightful and informative but not inspirational,"This book is good for anyone who wants an introduction into the art of play writing... To that end, it is brilliant. However in terms of inspiring the reader to bring his or hers ideas to life, the book lacks something."
4,very sturdy. and way easier than soaking with a bucket!,"I picked up a pair of these for my gelding to soak his feet to help relieve a deep thrush problem and contracted heels. Having barely made it out alive soaking a foot when he had an abscess a few years ago, I knew the bucket route wasn't an option (had to hold the other foot up to keep his sore foot in the bucket). These really seem quite well put together and toughMy small footed ASB fits a large with some but not too much wiggle room. I purchased a couple of round bath sponges about the size of the bottom of his foot and will be using these to help with the soaking process."
4,pretty interesting,"Reading this book I felt like he started with one amazing metaphor to establish in the book that he could think of good metaphors. But then after that there aren't any in here. It really is an incredible metaphor that makes perfect sense, but after setting me up to want more metaphors, there just aren't really any. Or aren't many. Some of the writing is pretty interesting. It's so saturated with quotes from other fancy books he's read that it's hard to tell sometimes what's a quote & what's his own writing. I guess that's a way to weave yourself into literary history. He has some free association in here that isn't so exciting, for me. The forms of these poems is crazy; that's fun, but a lot of other avant-garde poets are a lot more interesting to me."
5,all women should have this,this is about all of us and many if not most of us have been there it is up lifting and encourageing I couldn't live without it
5,sisters,"Not only did the voices and music witness and minister to my heart, but the words did. So many WOMEN can relate to every song and emotion that was presented in song. This is a great witnessing and ministry tool. This music truly demonstrates Women Equipping Women."
3,A So-So Collection,"I'm one of those people who first danced to many ""Tom Moulton"" mixes and then played lots of them when I became a DJ. Yes he set the standard for how to remix. And yes 30 years on some of his mixes still sound fresher than anything that's currently out there. I just wish this collection had more ""greatest hits"" than it does. There's just too much filler--I honestly don't remember hearing or playing some of the songs on this collection. And then to have Al Downing's ""I'll Be Holding On"" be an unreleased (inferior) version, instead of the regular version--that's so wrong. (Incidentally, I bought this CD specifically because of this song. What a disappointment!) I just hope that someday, someone will put out a definitive collection of ""Tom Moulton"" mixes. I anxiously wait for that day."
5,FOOTSTEPS OF MESSIAH -- MOST INFORMATIVE READING,"Written by a Jewish Rabbi who came to realize that Yeshua (Jesus) was indeed the Promised Messiah of Israel. So much is taught here. Hebrew is the author's first language and enables him to open the Scriptures and shine the light of truth. My husband and I have read it together numerous times. I could not recommend more highly.We recently discovered another book of similar value: ""Our Father ABRAHAM,"" written by Marvin R. Wilson, who is a leading scholar on Christian-Jewish relations.Shalom"
5,Best book on prophecy I've ever read.,Mr. Fruchtenbaum does not get caught up in sensationalizing the topic...instead he uses clearly defined rules of interpretation. Even though this work was published in the early 80's it is no less valuable today. Without question this is the best book on Biblical Prophecy I've ever read.
3,"Not bad, but a little deceptive","The main phone and cradle in this set are identical to the Uniden EXI376 cordless phone, which was a Consumer Reports Best Buy.So far this seems like a pretty nice phone. The reception is clear, it's easy to program, and has some nice features. The extra handset does make it easy to pick up the phone anywhere in the house.However, the concept is a little deceptive. You can't actually talk on both handsets at the same time. So if two of you want to talk to a caller at the same time, you'll still have to have another phone."
2,VERY VERY FUZZY,Compared to another 900 MHz phone we have that cost about $20 it was terrible. The reception was interuppted by noise everytime you turned your head. I have returned it and am looking for another phone. Want to avoit interferance with a wireless home network
3,sent mine back within a week,"I got this phone to be able to have two phones without having two jacks, that part of it was great, but everytime I was on the phone with someone the phone would shut itself off. every two minutes or so it would just shut off and you would have to call them back and hope it wouldn't happen again.As far is the reception, I thought that was great, we always run into reception problems in our house but this phone actually had none.As far as the battery life goes, as long as the phone would stay on it would run for a long time and charging was quick and simple also.Perhaps we just got a bad phone and I am thinking of ordering it again and hoping for the best!"
3,"OK phone, but reception is sketchy","This is a feature rich, but quality low phone. It is 900Mhz, but I expected a bit better reception. Both phones work off of the main base. Becuase I find the effective range to be about 30ft in a New York City apartment, there is very little utility to the second headset. It would work much better at 2.5Ghz. The backlight on the display also reminds me of a $10 watch I owned in 1970. (In other words it is really dark.) My final evaluation is that it is just good enought not to go through the hassle of returning. I wouldn't recommend it to others - even for the $."
1,Not Recommended - Very bad reception.,"Pros:1. intuitive design and features- I didnt open the manual but but was able to figure out all of the functions and was able to program numbers easily.2. cost- it's cheap. 2 phones for the price of one.Cons:1. Reception- regardless of how near of far I am to the base, I keep getting an annoying buzz sound. It is really irritating when trying to hold a conversation. The buzzing sound comes and goes but it is driving me nuts. The other cordless phones that I own do not have this problem. The basic function of a phone is so that 2 parties can talk to one another. There shouldn't be any static."
4,Great for long distance relationships,"These phones are small and comfy to talk with, but you can't use the second one as an extension (ie have your kids talk to granny at the same time) since only one handset works at a time when in use.The big bonus is that you have 10 hours of talk time, and you can transfer the call from one unit to the other, so that makes it 20 hours... lots o' whisperings of sweet nothings!"
1,Lots of hissing noise,"I've had Uniden 900 MHz phones before, they worked fine. This model produces nothing but static as soon as I'm more than 20 feet away from the base. Do not buy it, however cheap it may seem.This phone will be returned to Amazon this week."
2,Remember the one about too good to be true....,"The IDEA of these phones is a good one - two units, one phone jack, one unit active at a time so no listening in to conversations... but there is something horrid about the reception. Within a couple of months the static got so bad that folks don't want to call our house any more. I'm looking for something else right now and thought i'd warn the others out there to get something else before it's too late."
4,Pretty Good Over View of Many Different Alternative Aspects,It can be really deep and a little to blaming but it is really good!
1,not good,I just think this is old and does not smell fresh at all. Sorry it has to come back. Wish it smelled better
5,WOW!,This cd is excellent from track one on. And Christian McBride on bass.....WOW EEE!!I highly recommend this cd to music lovers especially if you love saxophone music.
4,"His Best in a Long,Long time","I've always dug David Sanborn but for a while in the late 80's through the 90's His Music got Corny&He seemed like He was just Air-Brushing it.He did enough to get by as to challenge Hismelf.well this Disc is a Welcome return to His Vibe&Flavor.I really dig How He re-does Stevie Wonder's ""Isn't She Lovely"".it has a warm Welcome feel to it.I'd say this Album is Between 3&half-4 Stars overall.much better than His Past Decade&change stuff easily."
2,Disappointed,"This book started off great and quickly lost momentum. The main character was weak and I do not like novels that portray woman as weak and so in love that they find their boyfriends bad behavior acceptable. This was one of those novels. I kept hoping that Hannah would wake up, realize Louis was a cad and dump him. Unfortunately she seemed desperate to save the relationship...and for what? So that he could dump her!"
5,"That's the way--uh-huh, uh-huh--I like them","Books, that is. This one grabbed me like a swirling tornado and sucked me up into its rich characters, laugh-out-loud humor, and rollercoaster of emotions. I was held captive til the last page. Ms. Brown's characters had me at ""hello"". I'd very much recommend this as a fun, engaging book. Everyone can relate to the push/pull of the heart strings that goes on within the characters. Reading this book was like dining at a fine restaurant and leaving very satisfied."
5,Great Introduction to nany aspects of birding,"I came into this book with some interest in learning to identify birds around the yard to a greater extent. This is the first book that I've seen to go beyond the basics of shape and color. It's actually a virtual biology lesson on birds with fine details about feathers, and molting among other topics. Very detailed materials that help the reader understand how to see the parts of the bird beyond quick impressions in order to make identifications. But I also gained a new insight into an animal that I took for granted just seeing every day. Sibley is an incredible artist and liberally demonstrates his concepts with sketches and drawings of a wide variety of birds. The combination of beautiful art, and clear, educational writing makes one of the best introductions I've ever seen to birds, and how to know and appreciate them. Highly recommended for the casual as well as serious bird enthusiast."
4,Beginners MUST HAVE Book,"This is an excellent book for beginner bird watchers. It teaches you how to avoid common mistakes in properly identifying a bird. It also explains the different terms for bird body parts and feathers. It's a short and easy to read book. I ordered Sibley's other book after reading this because there was still a lot I wanted to learn that wasn't covered in this book. The illustrations are incredibly good!I bought this book on sale at Strand's in NY.** I went out birdwatching after reading the book and realized that it's actually a GREAT book with very useful and practical information. I want to increase my rating to 5-stars, but can't figure out how."
4,"Very good course in ""Observation 101""","I feel this is an excellent source for placing the birds observed in the ""proper context"". That is to say, it helped me be more observant of the time of year, habitat type, stages of the bird's life, and much more. This information reinforces or brings into question my initial identification. As an experienced wildlife observer, but a relative novice to birding, I find this book to be an important tool. It is thorough, clear, and covers sound bird biology information without reading like an ornithology text book."
1,Birdwatching on a Kindle?,No offense but the Kindle is not the vehicle for a birdwatching book (maybe when the color kindle comes out?)
2,Too Graphic For My 7 Year Old Daughter,"I am pretty disappointed with this book. I thought that since it is written for ages 5-8 it would be perfect to read with my 7 year old daughter. I wasn't expecting a book telling my daughter how the man ""fits his penis inside the woman and semen flows inside her vagina"". My daughter isn't raised with TV so maybe this book would be appropriate for a tv raised peer but not for my daughter until she is at least 10. Some of the pictures are too graphic for her as well (picture of the man in the shower, husband and wife naked in bed together and the laboring woman spread eagle). This book is too much information for a 7 year old! I wished I had read the reviews before purchasing or I wouldn't have bought it, at least not for a few more years."
4,Before I Was Born,Helpful for my 9 year daughter that recently has had questions on reproduction and puberty. It has a godly focal point with clear explanation and pictures.
5,Great way to break the ice,I bought this book for my daughter and it was a great way to introduce discussion about sexuality. It really brought it all together and I hope it will lead to further discussion and a life time of open and honest dialogue. Building a firm foundation may help keep her on the straight and narrow through her teen years!
4,Before I Was Born-Gods Design For Sex,"This is a good book for teaching our children about how our bodies work and how God designed a man and a women's body to fit together. They put an age on it of 4-8. I read it with my almost 10 year old son, he thought his heart would beat out of his chest. There is not a chance that I would read this to my 4-8 year old. I felt it was too mature for what they could understand and is more information than I want them to know at their age. For me, it was pushing it for my almost 10 year old. However, I want to be the one my children learn this from and not a friend at school or the school themselves. I feel this is the parents responsibility and not the school. In that respect, this book does a great job in teaching it. Just not for 4-8 year olds."
5,Excellent,An excellent introductory for telling young children about God's design for sex in a marriage setting.
4,Age approprate,"Just enough info for this age. Lost one star for being a little old fashioned. For example, the pregnant woman stays home while pregnant. In today's society most women work to full term if they can, I know I did."
1,overwhelmingly Christian,"The info is complete, but I could really do without the preachy Christian world view.Having said that, if you are a devout Christian and a frustrated with having you beliefs undermined, then this is the book for you. Good knowlege, and solid writing.For Everyone Else: a better pick would be:Where Do Babies Come From?: For Ages 6 to 8 and Parents (Learning About Sex Series, Bk. 2)by Ruth S. Hummel,Both books are solid picks for Public and School Libraries, dependant on your service area"
5,Informative at a childs level,My husband and I have two boys under the age of ten and we are facing issues with sex. Our children are hearing about sex from children at school and on the bus. We are a Christian family and want our children to have Christian views on something so important. We bought the whole series and our boys now have all the answers they need from us. Thank you so much for this series.
3,Early Von Trier,"This little Lars von Trier film proceeds with a peculiar blend of Bergmanesque tragedy and relaxed sense of self-reflexivity. Two screenwriters lose their script and switch gears to a story about the release of the bubonic plague in Medieval Europe. In the process, the writers appear to unleash a real plague as the film switches from scenes of artistic creation to their own modern predicament. This is minor von Trier-with the exception of some darkly antagonistic scenes in dungeon-like rooms. The ending is obnoxiously sophomoric, though some will love it."
3,It's alright...there must be better...,"The graphics quality isn't that great. In today's day and age, I know the technology exists for better graphics on Scrapbook software."
3,"Not bad at all, grows on you","It was given to me, and I've listened to it several times over the years. I kind of like it, even though it isn't what I would ordinarily choose for listening. I think she's someone different and authentic."
1,Not compatible,"I purchased a PA870U v3 based on the information in this add, but it is not compatible with hp ipaq hx2415. I checked with Targus and they told me that it is not compatible with the hx2415.Nate"
3,Not Impressive Impressionist,"Kunzru comes highly recommended as do most books these days. I haven't heard Nobel, but the guy has received all the praise in the world. Of course, any project of this size and scope deserves respect and it is no mean achievement to be sure, but I didn't enjoy the book. I think the work may be much stronger than I first imagined, but on first reading, I couldn't get into what I thought was a lot of picturesque Third World moments, taken right out of the playbook of an American tourist. The scenes struck me as rehearsed and to well-digested. As to the writing, it is programmatically realistic fiction with the usual bit of predictable enchantment. The writing is unimpressive but certainly publishable. I just don't think it comes up to the highlest standard set by other now-recognized masters of the genre of post-colonial excursions."
1,Starts out interesting then turns disgusting,"I am not one who can't handle any sort of violence or sexual deviance. However, after half of this book i had to toss it away because there was nothing redeeming about it. Every Character we encounter is wicked and sexually deranged. I need a shred of hope to contine reading especially if i am to endure such explicit rape scenes. ugh!"
5,Fantastic read,"With wit and empathy, this fantastic novel compassionately tells the life of a boy born from a wild and improbably union. Romping through brothels in India, sex parties, and the streets of London ,the reader remembers how fortunate we are sometimes to have a place of familiarity."
1,Too many characters,"I thought this book would be great, but it turned out to be a huge disappointment...WAY too many details, too many characters to keep track of, unlikeable characters, and just simply a drag to read!"
1,"""Nothing"" is right!","Kunzru reportedly received over a million dollars for this meaningless, overwritten bit of bilge that adds nothing to the impressively growing body of fine fiction about India, or by Indian authors, and after dumping it halfway through, I have to shake my head and wonder why.The book's prologue is the best part, there's an interesting beginning to the first section before the ""hero,"" ""The Impressionist"" himself, gets thrown out onto the streets and into a series of truly picaresque adventures.First off, Pran is such a cipher as to be totally uninteresting and uninvolving, and there aren't any secondary characters to fill the gap. His first adventure is a truly tedious period in a minor political squabble. A great deal of this is devoted to sending up the ruling English class, all or which has been done better in a few hundred places, both in literature and on film.I haven't read anything lately that's been as big a waste of time and money as The Impressionist was."
3,not great but worth reading if you like busy plots,"I found this title at the library, having missed all the hype somehow. Criticisms by previous reviewers here are accurate (confusing, too many ""plotlets,"" too many themes crammed into too short & ambitious a book, cartoonish characters, strange ending) YET I enjoyed the book anyway. I think Kunzru has loads of potential and the book offers some fine reading moments. I didn't mind the ending at all and I think the Fotse economic system is a brilliant piece of imaginative writing."
5,Stunning!,"Can't remember when I have been so captivated by a novel. The reviewers who complain that the main character hasn't much depth are right--but they don't really get that this is the whole point. Kunzru is making a comment on the flexibility of identity. Pran's initial identity is a lie (although he doesn't know it), subsequent identities are forced upon him by necessity and others' needs and expectations, and he eventually learns that he can manipulate his own identity to his advantage. An absolutely stunning, yet playful, story that demonstrates the ways in which we perceive ourselves and others and how we shape personal and cultural values. Outstanding--I can't recommend it highly enough and wish I could give it 10 stars!"
2,Flashman did it better,"The Flashman novels of George MacDonald Fraser with an Anglo-English anti-hero instead of an English one crammed into one volume totally lacking the wit and humor of the Flashman books. Rather than this, I recommend you stick with the Flashman novels, Victorian and Edwardian travelogues, and contemporary nonfiction on the topics on East-West ethnic and religious conflict, sexuality, and manipulation."
5,"good and evil are all around ,but the Godly wins.","I had a excellent time reading this book! A soul spiritual feeling story with the true meaning of how good God can work in our lifes. This book had me wanting to keep reading on more and more just to see what happens next.I would not mind a series to be put in to place. Montana is the real meaning of how a spiritual women should handle herself in everyday situations.please get this book if you have not ,this is one to keep and to give to others so the word of how incredible God is can be spread."
5,Willie's Got dem' Blues !,"My first thought was "" Willie can't play the blues!"", and as I played a few seconds of each cut while driving home, I thought I was right. Wrong! As a ""fringe"" Willie fan. but Blues fanatic, I had to give this album a try. Willie with Keb, BB, Johny (Lang), Dr. John, Kenny, and Susan? It works. andit's nothing short of incredible. You've never heard Willie like this before. A perfect blend of Willies vocals and some of todays Blues greats. It reminded me why I've got a few W. Nelson albums in my collection! I think I'll be adding a few more. I highly recommend this album to anyone who enjoys this arist, as well as the, ""open minded"" Blues fan, it's worth a listen. A perfect blend!"
3,not so fast,"I love Willie Nelson-and I love the Blues.I respectfully recommend you buy one or the other.Willie's ""there you are"" is an awesome song but its a stretch to do this.I don't see a ""good man feelin' bad"" just a so so album.With respect."
3,not if you are in a hurry,cd took weeks to arrive and when it did the case was destroyed. cd plays fine and for the $5.00 price tag I couldn't go wrong
4,Willie does the blues,"Willie Nelson isn't always known for being a blues singer, but the Milk Cow Blues CD demonstrates he certainly is capable of doing the blues. Willie surrounds himself with a fine cast of blues people and they all deliver. A highly entertaining and highly recommended CD."
4,Best Rhythm Guitar in Texas,"I am a big Willie Nelson fan but the real reason I bought this CD was to hear Derek O'Brien, Jon Blondell and George Rains back him up. Derek is my all-time favorite rhythm guitar player. I thought ""The Thrill is Gone"" was a little tired on this collection, but hearing Willie introduce Derek for a solo with B.B. King on the same stage was great! It's really too bad Willie had to have special guests in order to sell this CD to his label ... he could have done just fine by himself with this great band"
5,COUNTRY BLUES AT ITS BEST!!,"IF YOU CAN FIND UTVRECORDS PURE BLUES ""NOW PLAYING"" LISTEN AND BE AMAZED. TRACK #4. FLOOD DOWN IN TEXAS. STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN AND WILLIE NELSON SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOGETHER ON THIS ONE!!"
3,Blues doesn't work for Willie fan,"The music is produced quite well, however I bought this cd because for Willie's voice which didn't seem to fit the blues theme. I like Willie and I like the blues, but Willie singing the blues was too much. Stardust would have been a better choice for his recent work."
4,Marcasite Figure Eight earrings and necklace,"I gave the earrings and necklace, sight unseen, as a gift, and they were very well received. I was sent a photo with my friend wearing them, and they are a good size and look nice.The necklace would be nicer with a proper chain fixture on the back of the figure eight."
2,Disappointed in the real thing,"The actual earrings were not as pretty as they appeared in pictures. I was disappointed, but not quite enough to go through the trouble of returning them."
1,Incoherent and Incomplete Chronology,"""Airwar Over Germany"" begins with a disproportionate emphasis on the Battle of Britain. I had hoped that this doc would provide a chronology of Allied strategic raids over Germany with requisite film footage. I was disappointed in this. I had also hoped for some detailed analysis of particular raids with the German defensive response but also found the doc to be mostly lacking in this regard. I often found the same film footage being used more than once or footage that was not illustrative of the topic being addressed. In comparing this doc with the original ""BATTLEFIELD"" series I found it truly inferior."
1,Political Bias,"""Battlefield: Air War Over Germany"" offers the revisionist view that the Allied bombing campaign against German industry and cities was ineffective and immoral. Current historiography on the bombing campaign is ignored. No comparison is made to German attacks on Warsaw, Rotterdam, London, Coventry, Stalingrad, or German devastation of USSR cities and population; or any mention of Japanese devastation of China.Not recommended."
5,Time for my spirit,"This little book contains short meditations on silence and solitude accompanied by beautiful reproductions of famous and inspirational paintings. The prose written is closely matched to the topic of the art and together, they have the effect of pulling me within, quieting me, and reminding me of what is important, even essential, to good living. I dont know how I functioned without this book but am grateful I will no longer have to be without it. I read it every morning, along with ""Words on Calm"" by the same editor. A wonderful and thoughtful gift that each of my freinds will be given the opportunity to enjoy."
5,"Paul Whiteman/20's Early 30's Fans, This is A MUST!","If you enjoy the Symphonic Jazz developed by Paul Whiteman and the sound of the legendary dance bands of the 20's, you'll love this CD.Of the many groups who attempt this style, SFSO is one of the very best. In my opinion, they, along with the Royal Society Jazz Orchestra and Keith Nichols are the very best of the best.Even of those three groups, none master the sweet side of Symphonic Jazz more than the SFSO. With 16 members, 5 of whom can play violin, and the hot jazz of one (if not the) great cornetist, Bob Schultz (Bix fans love him), and the ideally suited crooning voice of Ed Rosenback, this CD is a WOW (as are the others by SFSO).My favorites include: Clementine, There Ain't No Sweet Man Worth the Salt of My Tears, Proud, and Sugar."
3,Sweet Gift,I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my fiance. We wear them on our keychains. It is not the best quality but for the money it is just right.
5,true magic,Would you like a book that explains you simple exercises so you can go beyond your death? Dont be scared this book is full of beauty!
1,this is SO not a STICKER book,"My son LOVES Buzz Lightyear and all of the characters from Toy Story, so this book seemed like a logical choice. There is one very important problem..the stickers do NOT stick. The stickers are in the middle of the book, you pull them off and place them over the corresponding picture, however, they literally fall off the page..not so much fun at all. The stickers are great looking..but if you buy this book, get ready to use your glue stick..you WILL need it!"
1,stickers do not stick,"I've got to agree with scoobiedo. The stickers DO NOT STICK in this book. After spending a good bit of time putting the stickers in the proper place, they were peeling off in no time. Also, the story is just ok--not that great. What I thought would be a fun book turned out to be a great disappointment."
4,Great images that don't stick so well.,"I bought this book for my 3 year old daughter who is infatuated with Toy Story 2. She loves it. There are a ton of stickers, and they cover both the original Toy Story and Toy Story 2. They're bright, vibrant and colorful, which really works well for a 3 year old.The only knock on the book is what others have said -- the stickers don't stick so well. The book claims that these stickers are reusable. To achieve that, the entire book is printed on glossy paper. So while it is easy to peel off the stickers, it's a bit too easy. They sometimes come off by themselves, and unfortunately, the glue just isn't as adhesive on the 2nd or 3rd try.This isn't a big issue for a 3 year old -- her attention is off to something else very quickly. If you've got an older child or someone who's a big collector of this stuff, they may be a bit disappointed, however."
4,Finally on CD!,"Made in CAN in 2001, Serial# AGEK-2308, Playing Time 43:10Originally released back in 1978, this is the band's 2nd album (their first was on a small label).Somewhat blending the genres of APRIL WINE (which were on the same record label) and TRIUMPH (from that era), TEAZE combines some straight-ahead rock (on tracks like ""On The Loose"", ""Baby Why Can't U"" and ""Lady Killer"") with some softer, almost country-flavored arrangements like on ""Sweet Misery"" and ""Stay Here"".Nothing ground-breaking, but commercially-oriented melodies. The complicity between the 2 guitarists is fresh and tight, and the rhythm section provides some solid background.An enjoyable and foot-stomping listening adventure, but not original by any means."
3,Made rather cheaply!,"When we received this product I was really happy. After my husband put it together, we find that it becomes quite wobbly and have to retighten everything frequently. The shade is very cheap and I will have to replace it."
3,review,I really like the magazine rack and table but the lampshade was impossible to set up. It was totally shot in the 3 places we were supposed to hook to the metal ring before we could set it up. My husband and I didn't have enough hands to hook up the lampshade.
2,Q: What do you call people who hang around musicians?,"A: DrummersThis compilation is an entire album of drummers going solo and doing their own songs. I wanted it because of two drummers in particular, Damon Che (Don Caballero) and Chris Freeland (The Oxes). Ironically, their tracks aren't among my favorites on the disc. Actually, it's hard for me to pick out ANY favorites on this CD. Very few stand out, and most of them simply aren't very interesting listening."
1,Ho hum so so not so good,Although it fits our grill like a glove it didn't last one summer in the Texas sun. It bleached and dry rotted and now has several tears in it. Very disapointed. Cannot recommend this.
2,Cheap,Cheaply made. Sun fades within the first month. Tears after being subjected to sun in a short time. Not worth the money.
2,thin,"This grill cover is thin, and may not last very long, but it's the only grill cover I could find to fit this little grill. Looks like it might tear easily, so it should not be manhandled."
2,Perfect Fit but........,"I used this cover on my Patio Pro grill and it fits snug and secure. I'm leaving it out this winter so I will be able to determine it's durability next spring. Ok, a winter has passed and the grill cover is a mass of holes and split seams. Not good to leave outside, but isn.t that why you buy a grill cover?"
5,Absolutely fantastic book!,"Thanks again to Ann Major for bringing to life another fantastic story! This one was a ""can't put it down"" type of book with an unbelieveable ending! Awesome reading!"
5,Eswpecial music for a special moments,"I like very much the Caucasian music, I knew yet Sandor Lakatos (I have different CD's from his Gypsy Band...) and really I enjoyed a lot of this CD."
4,Great for Ghost Hunting!,This lens is easily slipped on and off of my Sony digital camera! It's great quality and I will probably be purchasing a back-up soon!
5,"Cuttingf edge, compassionate work!",I found Dr. Tracy Gaudet's book to be a wonderful integration of modern medical science with intuition and instinct. I just loved it and found it tremendously empowering and helpful. I totally recommend it.
5,A Book Every Woman Should Read,"Consciously Female is a book that is as interesting as its title. I am not a doctor, nor do I have any medical background, yet I was totally able to identify with most of the information (if not all) that Dr. Gaudet mentions in the book. It is a great book and an excellent read.Dr. Gaudet is right. Women health issues have been marginalized in social and professional systems. For example, a woman suffering from PMS is not considered a reason good enough for her boss to give her the day off. She's expected to carry on being productive, regardless of the hormonal, physical and emotional turmoil stirring inside her.A pregnant woman is expected to tolerate morning sickness, but not yet educated about the reason why it happens, or how to embrace it.More interesting issues Dr. Gaudet raises are inside this valuable book. I highly recommend it to anyone who believes they should listen more to what their bodies tell them, and schedule their actions accordingly."
1,Don't waste you money!,"Another piece of pretension. There is very little in this book that the everyday working-on-a-budget person would find useful or helpful. The elevated position of the 'designer', and the negated, nay pejorative, position of the creative imput of the 'client' is much in evidence throughout the text of this book. A boutique piece of fluff. And a tree had to die for this!"
5,Pleasant smell takes a little bit of getting used to,"I purchased this product and it came very elegantly wrapped in a nice bottle. When I first sprayed it on my skin I thought wow, this is a powerful odor. But it took only a few minutes until the scent separated and became recognizable as jasmine and rose. It smells much better 15 minutes after spraying, and after 30 minutes it is even nicer. Very satisfactory and I would recommend to all."
1,Where In The World Is Carmen Sandiego? (Jewel Case),"i LOVED this game as a kid, so excited when i found it agin, well it is nothing like the original you couldent realy do anything just followed the game"
4,Game use as an Educational Tool,A classic game that has been updated with video portions. My fifth grader really enjoyed the game and has spent several enjoyable hours learning how to get around the world on his mission as a gumshoe. This game can be used educationally to teach about Geography and good information about various places around the globe.Where In The World Is Carmen Sandiego? (Jewel Case)
3,item is in good condition but not workable,"i guess i didn't realize that carmen san diego software is somewhat old and newer systems have much updated fancier versions of quicktime, that will not run carmen. making this cd completely non usable.!!!i have recently bought a mac, but know that this will also probably not work since mac also has very updated version of quicktime, also resolution has to be dummied down to only 256 colors, it is non operable in millions of colors that all new pc and mac systems have.the main point: make sure older game software is compatible.also thank goodness i did not spend much."
1,How to make the program with Windows XP,"To run the program in Windows XP without the computer frequently locking up, I have found that this procedure works: Install the program, right-click on the shortcut icon, click Properties, click the Compatibility tab, check the Compatibility Mode box and choose Windows 95, click Apply, and then click Okay. Where In The World Is Carmen Sandiego will now run, at least on my Sony Vaio with a Pentium proceesor, and 2 gigs of RAM."
3,Your CD cover image is incorrect!,"I bought this product under the pretense it was the Carmen Sandiego game from 1996, simply based on the description and jewel case cover photo. I was sent a copy of the game made in 2001.The updated version is a perfectly workable game. I just wanted the one I played back in middle school!"
2,Where in the World is the old Carmen Sandiego Game?,I prefer playing the old game that came out in the 80s/90s. This game was too cartoonish.
2,Where in the World is the game?,"I love the premise of this game, and would probably rate it very highly....if it did not shut down my brand new Dell 8400 every time my son used it. NOT real pleased."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"Extremely disappointed with this lens. Poor focus after 15', Images never sharp under any condition . Not at all what you would expect from an L series. Lots of $$$$ poor performance. Working on third copy. Unfortunately did not get chance to evaluate prior to warranty running out.CAUTION!!!!PS Also failed to research product reviews until too late, my bad, Better luck to all!"
2,"Price, jeeze.","I don't understand why a product that is so heavily subsidized here in the US, and that most food manufacturers get cheaper than sugar, costs soooooo much.This is rediculous.But, you got to use it in some baked goods and candies.Oh, Karo isn't any better than other brands. You can add your own vanilla if you want with lesser known, cheaper brands."
2,Begginer in an Apartment Building,"I live in an apartment, so I try and make my practicing as quiet as possible. That said this was not the way to go for me. This didn't quiet the violin a whole lot. I ended up going with a metal heavy mute which really dampens the sound, and alas- no complaints from neighbors!"
4,Rating Akimbo and the Elephants,"I think you should read this book because it is about a boy named Akimbo who lives in Africa. His mission is to save a lot of elephants. Akimbo travels 35 miles to prevent an entire herd of elephants from being shot solely for their ivory tusks. Ultimately, he rescues the elephants by tricking the poachers into the hands of the rangers. I personally think you should read this book because it is a fun and an easy to read book. It keeps you in suspense and gives you a sense of hope for our future.by Virginia Pocket"
5,Great for the classroom,"Another great book in Alexander's delightful style. This one is a great book to have in the classroom in order to open dialogue on conservation, preservation and other related topics."
2,An Average SVH Book...(** 1/2),"When Jessica finds out about Enids Terrible Past, who shes Running Against as Prom Queen, she Uses It to her Advantage and Spreads the News All over School, Wiping Out her Competitions Chance of Winning. To make thing worse, Enids Boy-Freind (Who, By the Way, was a Total Jerk) Breaks Up with Her Because of her Doings in the Past. I Felt that this Book was a Little Short Compared to its Ninteen Chapter Predrecessor...Overall, it was Okay, and In the End, Jessica Finally Got what She Deserved..."
2,An anti-Pagan work of Christian propaganda,"If you are open minded, this book may cause you to shake your head in disbelief. I say this due to the correlation without causation, in regard to the rather weak conclusions made by the author, which seem mostly emotive and narrow of purpose and/or intellect. This is to say that the text is one-sided in its presentation, and that it is a narrow view of the material discussed."
5,Hitting the Nail on the Head,"Peter Jones correctly and painstakenly documents the root of many of problems afflicting our modern society. In Spirit Wars, Dr. Jones shines the light of truth on the agenda of the pro-choice/homosexual/radical feminism agenda and ties them together in a neat little knot. He does this by exposing the very words spoken and written by the leaders of such groups, uncovering their true agenda. Indeed, the book is heavily footnoted and documented. In short, Spirit Wars helps to identify what lies at the root of todays ""man centered"" way of thinking that was brought into the mainstream by the Me Generation. It is no wonder that his targets howl and attack the messenger. They cannot dispute the content of Spirit Wars because to do so, they would dispute their own words, actions and deeds."
3,"A great book for novices. For experts, it is not a must.","I have found a lot of great information in this book. It is very good if you are a novice and you want to get an average level of knowledge regarding building and improving cylinder heads, camshafts and valvetrains. On the other hand, the book won't be of much help to the amateur mechanic wanting to improve his car. It lacks a finer lever of detail. I have tried some of the performance tricks suggested in this book, on the cylinder head of a small European car (R12, 1397ccm): I did some valve unmasking and worked on the intake ports. Although it seems there's some performance increase, the result is not breathtaking. Still, following the suggestions in the book I succeeded to rebuilt an engine in such a way than, if it hasn't gained as much power as I expected, it definitely has gained reliability."
2,What a surprise a history of Muslim Indonesia,"Why does this 'history' begin in 1200? Becuase that is when Islam came to Indonesia and therefore, according to the author, there was no history of the country before that time. The Indonesian Hindu and Buddhist temples that pre-date the coming of Islam might be a suprise to anyone reading this book. The fact that before the 1965 anti-Chinese genocide there used to be a large number of Chinese in Indonesia might come as a suprise. it might come as a surprise that there are Christians in Indonesia or that in the 19th century women still used to walk around without having to cover their hair in public.This is a one sided biased book that views Indonesia only through the glasses of Islamic Indonesia and ignores minorities and all the diverse people that inhabit the archipelego.Seth J. Frantzman"
4,Interesting read,"Not a traditional feminist view, provides an interesting and diverting look at a future controlled by women. I thought the ending was a little predictable, but entertaining and satisfying all the same. Well worth it. I read this book 20 years ago and loved it then, too."
5,Can we get a kindle version please!,"I am a huge fan of post apocalyptic fiction and anything with strong female characters is a bonus. This is the kind of story that will haunt you long after the last page is turned. I discovered this book at a used bookshop and I have re-read this book so many times, my copy is ragged. Upon recommending this book to several of my friends I was sad to discover there is no digital copy. Luckily this has not stopped my friends from purchasing the hard copy, but I would love to see this book in e-book format. The Shore of Women is the kind of tale that needs to be shared and the view points of human sexuality are even more relevant in the modern world. This story is so thought provoking it would be perfect for a book club or report for women's studies."
5,"Great book, a MUST-READ if you are a sci-fi fan.","Very interesting social scenario, this adventure is intriguing enough that you won't want to put it down till you finish it."
1,Disappointing,This film was OK. I actually found is disappointing.It was dragged out too much. I did enjoy watchingthe dancing but that was about it. Maybe I expectedtoo much but as I said I found it disappointing to say the least.
3,"Strong, but not progressive. Too much initial bite!","The brakes on my 2001 Yamaha FZ1 weren't ever weak, but it never hurts to have too much brake, right? Well, I put these HH+ pads on and went from two-finger braking to one-finger only. The good news is that they're strong pads and will slow you in a hurry. I never had any problems with fade, but I've only used them on the street. They also gave a firmer feel at the lever than the OEM pads, which I appreciated. Fit and finish were just fine, no problems installing.However, good braking has two components, power and control. These pads are so agressive that they make modulation harder than it ought to be. My brakes went from nicely progressive to almost switch-like on/off. I had to re-learn to be very, very gentle with the lever unless I wanted to slow aggressively. Some may consider that a plus, but I think for normal street riding it was too much and not as pleasant as other pads. That's what dropped my rating from 5 to 3 stars."
4,Good technical read...,"Although most of the book was dedicated to spelling out exactly why a high carbohydrate/low fat is bad, there is still room for tons of explanation for why a low carbohydrate eating plan will help prevent and treat several major diseases. It includes the evolution of the low carb diet and the author's plan for success which is just not to eat above 72 grams of carbohydrate a day. Overall, an interesting, highly technical read for those interested in the why rather than the how of low carbing. Not really a weight loss book at all - more the biology of low carb. I for one am kind of tired about reading the evils of low-fat and would have prefered to see just the pros of low carb. That's why I gave the book 4 stars."
5,Best Low-Carb Book,"This is probably the best low-carb book presently on the market. It is succinct and to-the-point and makes a whole lot of sense with no hype. The theory of 72 carbs a day as a limit is based on Dr. Lutz's own practice, in which he cured literally thousands of people from various diseases. Dr. Lutz was doing this even before Atkins' first book came out in the 1970's. I think 72 grams of carbs is an ideal number to follow-- since it still allows fruits, vegetables, and even bread--but at the same time is not too high. They do not make a big deal about inducing ketosis (as does Atkins), and thus seems very practical for the common person. I used to be very much opposed to low-carb diets, but after reading this book I have become a great supporter of low-carb eating. Everyone who considers trying low-carb eating must read this book."
2,Buy with caution,"Geared more for the ""expert"". A bit outdated. Look inside before purchasing. I would not recommend Look up the basics online and save your money"
5,Excellent Book,"Years ahead of its time, and backed by detailed evidence. It may not be what you would like to hear, but its enlightning to say the least..."
4,Good lifestyle book in low-carb field,This is a good book with solid low-card evidence. It is not a weight loss book but rather a health maintenace book. The information is somewhat dated but still usefull. Recommended for people interested in low carb but concerned about more extreme examples in diet books.
3,Good addition to the low carb library,"This book had some different outlooks on low-carbing, and a refreshing emphasis on low-carbing for health rather than weight control. I think ""Protein Power"" by the Eades team is a better one for the beginner though, with a lot of detail on the science behind the low carb idea. Another favorite of mine that gives a good overview, extensive history and science is ""Good Calories, Bad Calories"" by Gary Taubes."
3,Didn't work for me,"Interesting read, but the program just didn't work for me. In truth, I found eating all that meat and dairy disgusting. It's a good idea, certainly, to cut down on bread - even eliminate it, if you can (me, I'll keep my slice of whole wheat toast as a weekend treat). And I probably consume too much fruit - grapes are like candy to me. But I just can't stomach - literally - all that meat. Tried this for losing weight, think I need to hop on the elliptical trainer instead."
2,Title of this book misled me; it's not about bread or wheat,"I am trying to get off of wheat (not glutens, just wheat). This book sounded like just what I was looking for--except that ""bread"" or ""wheat"" doesn't even appear in the index! Instead, it's a book about eating without CARBS, of which bread is only a small part. This title is a direct translation from the German. Had I known that it was so inaccurate, I would not have bought this book. Its one saving grace is that, if you're trying to eat without carbs, it's not a bad book, and he mentions Dr Weston A Price, who knew what he was talking about.But it wasn't at all the book I thought it was."
2,Pass it by!,"Not much here that hasn't been written about before. Stick to a diet of lean meats, lots of fruits and vegetables and save your money."
1,Waste of money,Basically this book tells you to eat meat cheese & eggs. And lots of it. Not much other information in this book.
4,Dr Oz recommended this for weight loss,"The product came quick and we had no problemsDr Oz said this would help with weight loss, It didn't help meBut that isn't the fault of the supplierThanks"
1,Goiter!,"Hello Everyone,I can now see that I will be the only onewriting a negative review. The product quicklyarrived which is a good thing. However, I hadtaken 3 a day, as I notice most people postinghere do. On the 4th day I'd taken it, I didn't takeanymore because I'd woke up with a goiter forming.I had originally bought the product for detox butI can see now that I will be going to a specialistand taking a different route to detox. Try this productfor yourselves, because everyone doesn't react thesame. I hope I have not developed hypothyroidism/or hyperthyroidism. I will keep my fingers crossedand hope this bulge on my neck doesn't get any largerin the meantime, as its difficult to breath!"
3,Not sure yet,"Have been taking this product for about 2 weeks now. Didn't notice much in the way of benefits that is worth mentioning; however, I have been feeling extremely hot the past few days. I also have been feeling extremely dizzy and just off center the last 2 days. Not sure if it's related to the Modifilan or not, but since another lady mentioned it was affecting her hormones, I thought I would add my 2 cents in. Will keep on taking it until the bottle is gone and see how it goes. Then I will wait a few weeks to see how my health is without to determine if I will purchase another bottle."
5,great product,Recently went on a trip where I heard about seaweed as a cleansing product. I have had a great response to it and now some if my other family members are using it. It gives me energy and keeps me regular.
1,Not the Original Modifilan,"The original ""Modifilan"" under this name ended in 2007. The patents For the original Modifilan is under a new name as ""Biofilam"" by Sea Bio Resources. I have researched into the legal matter and have come to the conclusion that the Modifilan being sold under this name is NOT true modifilan but instead, a knock-off and possibly illegal. The Modiflan website reviews appear to be based in the early 2000's by users and hold water at the time of reviews made. The product under the name ""Modifilan"" has since changed with cheap seaweed. The reviews before 2007 reflect the newer Biofilam product. Buyer beware.BIOFILAM IS THE GENUINE ""MODIFLAN"" CURRENTLY.I encourage everyone to look into this matter themselves.I do not work for Sea Bio Resource or an affiliate, however, am a concerned consumer that believes in quality."
3,Uncertain,"I haven't taken this long enough to ""see"" or realize any results ... I am assuming it takes about a month to do any good ... it was recommended by Dr. Oz, so who knows! I plan on taking it until this bottle runs out and will make a decision at that time whether to purchase more or not ... had no complaints with the supplier/shipper."
4,Satisfied customer....,The product was just as represented. I am a satisfied customer. This product replaced one I was already taking. The comparison came up to expectations.
2,It Works! It did take weight off! Off my....,"....WALLET. Seriously, this was another Dr. Oz recommendation that my sweetheart bought into. But she asked her doctor, (after she bought it), and her Dr. advised that although some studies indicated efficacy, it won't work for her because of her thyroid or pancreas or something.So, rather than waste it, I used it. And I used it religiously, just like Dr. Odd said to - one pill a day. I just finished the bottle, and I can report that at the start I was 202lbs, and today I am at 203lbs.Note, those weights were taken without my wallet. If I had been carrying my wallet, I definitely would have seen a reduction in whatever 3 $20 bills weigh...!Dr. Oz, you got us again. But maybe this will finally drive my sweetie pie to give you up! Every single day Dr. Oz comes up with another supplement or two you need to take - if you took everything he suggests for what ails you, you'd be taking a mixing bowl full of pills, powders and potions every day!"
2,Seemed to interfere with balancing female hormones,"It didn't work well for me. This product seemed to interfere with balancing estrogen--it seemed to negate Estro Balance Complex. Could have been that I should have taken the Estro Balance at night and this product in the morning. I ended up getting thyroid medicine instead, and stopped taking this product."
3,Not sure yet,I'm not sure if it is helping me. I'm taking it for my thyroid. I'm not extremely ill so I'm just hoping to improve my health. Great price compared to other supplements.
5,Brown Seaweed is wonderful,"This product has made a small difference in my life so far. I have been taking this for 2 weeks and suffer from health problems. When you are suffering, any improvement can make all the difference. I tried other brown seaweed products before Modifilan, such as Limu. - I will stick with Modifilan."
5,Came Well Recommended,"This product came well recommended by the product manufacturer himself who called me personally, and gave me recommended dosages for my wife when she was under radioactive iodine treatment for her cancer. This product may be the only supplement in the world that has clinical studies to back up its effect against radiation in the body. The seaweed is grown off the coast of Russia, and this was what they used to treat the Chernobyl nuclear radiation disaster victims, with good results."
3,my review,"I started takeing this product a few months ago. I read all the claims and thought wow this must be something. The only thing I noticed and my kids noticed is that our bowl movements are huge. This stuff really cleans you out. I'm not sure if that is what it is supposed to do but that is what I've noticed. No other signs that I can tell. I don't feel any different when I take it or don't. But I figure why not take it, it doesn't seem to hurt any."
4,100 activities based on the catechism of the Catholic Church,NIce ideas for 1-8t grades. Easy and varied project sheets. I like that it gives other options for a class.
3,Not quite what I thought it was,"This is a nice book, but I thought it would be more substantive. I was hoping the book might help me come up with ideas for teaching my religious education class, but found the ""activities"" consisted mostly in little tear-out worksheets. Especially for the lower grades, the ""activities"" might be just a little coloring page, for example, that illustrate a lesson you have to come up with yourself. So it's a fine companion to reinforce what you're already teaching, but it won't inspire you to come up with a lesson plan."
4,Get Up and Move!,"We were actually fortunate enough to see the ""Yo Gabba Gabba: There's a Party in My City!"" when it was here in Chicago and my boys still talk about it. It is perfect for them to watch the show whenever they want or take it in the car. There is lots of singing and dancing which I love because it gets my boys up and moving. I mean really how could you not want to dance along? Its also very energetic since Lance was actually performing it live."
5,A Great DVD,"I have never seen Yo Gabba Gabba live in concert before, so when I received this DVD I knew I was in for a treat. I had seen their television show before and my kids have enjoyed them since they were young. They blend of music and excitement is contagious and the kids thrive on it. This DVD is great and incorporates wonderful music and engages kids in the concert itself. So even if you are not able to attend a live concert you can have a live concert right in your own family room. One word of caution though, the songs are very contagious and by watching us don't be surprised if your kids start singing the songs day in and day out, and before you know it, you will be too. This is a great DVD for the entire family."
3,"It was just ""ok""","The dvd itself was in excellent condition, however the content on the dvd got really boring at times. The T.V version of the live concert is much better. It edited out the boring parts..."
4,What a great book!,"I loved this book, it was original and very funny. I literally didn't want to put it down. Poor Bill Clinton must have hated this book. I just wish the ending had wrapped things up."
3,Imaginative but Flawed,"I had very mixed feelings about this book. It is extremely imaginative, its bleak view of the future seemed posible in many ways, the characterization of Bill Clinton (both young and old) was touching, funny, insightful, and rightfully critical, and the characterization of the viciously bureaucratic Carville was impressive. But other characterizations were weak. Sal did not come across as a real woman and Virginia was a cartoon caricature. The book was also carelessly written. For example, the 1995 George/Carville is said to be 51 years old on pages 307 and 296, and in his late 50s on page 355 (since he was 27 in 1963, he should be 59). Also, the plot was often not thought out carefully enough, and in many places the novel rambles on. The ending, which does not make a statement of any kind, just fizzles out and was a disappointment. I gave this book three stars for its good traits, but that was a real compromise in my mind."
2,Okay read,"I liked this book alot for the type of book it was. It entertained me and got a few laughs and that's all I expected from a SCI FI book about Bill Clinton and Big Brother and time travel. Not worth the 5 stars some are raving about, but certainly not deserving of the ""lone star"" either. In my opinion."
5,Excellent Reading!!,I loved the book! It was wonderful and I couldn't put it down. The cover picture is awesome...
2,dont waste your money,poor game. we cant get past the barn level. theres no way out even following arrows they just lead you in a circle.
5,Mr. Warmth himself !,"""Nice to see you in a red shirt, right in the front. I never entertained a Mountie ! Forty million Americans and I gotta get a Mountie ! Hello dummy !"" This album was first released in 1968, but you'd never think it ! This is just about the ultimate CD to make anybody who's politically correct blead from the ears ! Extremely funny, extremely rude, extremely modern ! How anybody was able to get this released in the late '60s is unbelievable ! Well done, Warner Bros. ! WARNING ! Do not buy this album for your grandmother's birthday ! She'll either die laughing, OR cut you from her will ! (Perhaps both.)"
4,A Guilty Pleasure!,"Hey, I thought I was the only person who thought Don Rickles was funny. Evidently not, as these other reviews show. I remember seeing Mr. Rickles in those Beach Blanket-type movies, displaying a subtly cutting sarcasm, and from his many appearances on Johnny Carson's show. Does anyone else remember him hosting Saturday Night Live once? I sure do! Buy this album right now and go back in time to when people said whatever the heck they felt like and there was no such thing as political correctness. He is like Bob Newhart's dark and evil twin!"
2,"Disappointing, to say the least...","Laugh for laugh, Don Rickles as 'the merchant of venom'probably causes me to break up more than any other comedian, so when Ifound out (this site) had SOMETHING of his for order, I couldn't wait to hear this album. Now after having listened to it, I can't wait to sell it as fast as I can.Most of the humour is hopelessly dated--it's funny but not up to Don's usual standards, and only the die-hardest die-hard could possibly love this album. If I were to rate the comedian, he'd get beyond five stars (if only that were possible), but this album sure wouldn't.He picks up steam near the end, but not enough to save the entire performance. Which, I might add, is thrown onto one track--something he could get away with (a la ""Live From Hell"") if the material was up to snuff, but it truly isn't.Sorry Don... I Know you've got better stuff than this in your closet, and the worst part is, you know it too."
1,Awful.,"I agree with the nay-sayers. I have always liked Don Rickles, but this CD isn't just not clever or funny, it's embarassingly bad. (Maybe he was better on TV??) Times have changed, of course, but besides the political incorrectness - picking on ""the Mexican"" and ""the queer"" in the audience - (very weak, unfunny jibes )- it just isn't good Don Rickles. I agree with someone else's comment that there must be much better Rickles material than this, available in the vaults. I have now heard this CD, and have just thrown it in the trash. I wouldn't give this to anybody as a gift. I can use the plastic case that it came in, at least."
2,A mean man,"After several minutes of his schtick, one realizes that being mean and nasty has its comedic limitations. I, for one, wished for someone in the audience to insult and humiliate Rickles, because he deserved it like no one else. I'm all for blowing the lid off political correctness (no one, surely could get away with this kind of routine today), but Rickles just isn't a likable or very funny guy here. Even for Jewish attack comics, this guy has no class and delivers few laughs."
1,Hello Dummy,I never received this item. How might one RATE an item that was NEVER RECEIVED? Perhaps you should CHANGE the format of the Create Your Review to include NEVER RECEIVING an item. Who has time day and night to track these many insipid items let alone REVIEW the transaction?
5,So cute!,"This journal is well-constructed with high quality paper and binding. Each page has some kind of fairy on it, which takes up some of the writing space but not an obtrusive amount. It has a ribbon to mark your page."
5,nutrition for children,This book is very helpful in guiding parents how to feed their children and grandchildren in order to nourish their bodies and minds.
2,Not worth the money,"This book is a cheap paperback, with some good information in it and some bad. I disagree with a lot of the meals in this book, and am still shocked that I payed close to forty dollars for it."
4,quick and cheap,Caring for School Age Children (1994 1st Edition)The book is just what I wanted and it came just on time for my first day in class. What more I got it for less than a dollar. You're a great help for people like me. Thanks a lot!
5,True turkish apricots,"I love apricots and have been fortunate to have travelled to Turkey and had real Turkish dried apricots. While traveling there I had found there were definite differences in size, taste, quality and freshness. These imported Turkish apricots are very good quality with excellent flavor and consistency. Having read the previous reviews I was concerned about the packaging, however they came in perfect shape. They are very well packaged - six clear plastic tubs arrived in their own cardboard box (like a six-pack of bottled beer) covered in clear plastic all around, and packaged again in amazon's usual box with air pillows. if the tubs get broken, then the two boxes they are all contained in have to get crushed as well. A great product and I will gladly purchase them again."
1,"Head baker-town center breads, inc",Three packages of the six shipped came in broken where product was exposed. These will have to be disposed of.
1,cheep modem,"This modem has consistently produced poor results. It constantly needs to be reset, and it overheats. Don't buy this ever."
1,Stopped Working after 2 Months,"I bought this modem at a Best Buy near my home. It worked very well for about two months. Out of nowhere, it stopped being able to carry a fast connection.It would work great for 5 minutes, then slow down or become totally unusable. I reset it constantly for two weeks trying to fix it. I contacted my internet provider and had a technician come out and look at my connection. He was unable to fix the speed issue and suggested the modem was no longer working.I purchased a motorola modem and it now my internet works well. I will not purchase another Zoom modem in the future, and would not recommend this product."
3,Alright modem but has some issues,"I used this modem for around two years with constant problems. On average I probably had to reset the modem two to three times a week due to over heating and lost connection. On occasion this modem would disconnect due to over heating and not be able to reconnect for several hours. But when it didn't over heat or loss connection this wasn't a bad modem. The set up was easy, and it allow for six computers to access the internet at one time with reasonable speeds."
2,easily overheated,"I have the same issue with this modem. After purchasing in 6/2012, in a few months, it just turned off by itself out of the blue. I thought it was my home power outtage. I unplugged and re-plugged but it did not turn on. After letting it sit for about an hr, I retried and lo and behold it came back.. but not for long then turned off again. I felt the modem pretty warm, so i figured it must shutdown itself when overheated. When it worked, it worked well (actually it was the only modem that works after I tried about 4-5 other more expensive brand) The cost was reasonable. However, Zoom gotta fix this overheating problem b/c it's annoying."
1,disappointment with kevin 11,"We are very frustrated with this toy, because its arm (the green arm of diamondhead) was broken on the first day my seven year old son played with it. I was with him at the moment, so I know that he wasn't exerting inappropriate force. He is really disappointed over that. Thinking that it is a quite expensive toy (over $100), I really regret that I have bought it."
4,A decent farewell album from a long-overlooked pop band,"Over the course of four albums, the Judybats' sound smoothed and streamlined; the only reason to shelve the band in the ""alternative"" rack is because they never made it big. But their ensemble songwriting and infectious acoustic-electric arrangements, as well as Jeff Heiskell's versatile singing and quirky wordplay, kept the Knoxville, Tenn. quintet one of guitar pop's more interesting artists until their breakup a couple of years ago. Despite a handful of top-flight tracks (particularly ""Don't Wait for Me"" and ""Stoned""), ""Full-Empty,"" the `bats' final full-length disk, shows some overall slippage; a tepid cover of the Bee Gees' ""Jive Talkin'"" is surprisingly unimaginative. Start with a different Judybats release-but be ready to come back for this one if you like what you hear."
1,Sound track only,"Misleading for advertisement.No any video for the music.For paco Pena: actually, it is the CD for Misa Flamenca"
5,The inspiration of women,"I am fascinated with this c.d. The women in this mariachi have beautiful voices that blend together to create such great harmony. It easily noticed with what great pride, passion, and expression the music is being played. There is defenaitly no doubt that out of all the all female mariachi groups, mariachi Reyna de Los Angeles has proven to be the best."
5,another gem by jose hernandez,"jose hernandez the founder of mariachi sol de mexico, decided to put together a group of female performers, and form in my opinion one of the best mariachi groups that i have ever heard. rocio durcal's vocals are just one of the highlights of many on this album, and i believe that this is a must have for any true fan of mariachi music. i had the oppurtunity to see them live in california last year and they were absolutely fantastic in concert. i highly reccomend this recording to all!!!"
5,Best put togther vocals and songs of Marachi!!!!!!!,"Every time I slip this cd into my CD player, it's a pleasure to here the beatiful vocals and wonderful harmony that comes from these 13 young ladies. The choices in songs have been well awaited in a cd. If you walk into a music store and picked up this cd in your hand and look at it and have second thoughts of purchasing it, it will be a great mistake for you as a Marachi music listner.You will not be upset of the purchase. If you have seen them in concert the same quality of pizzazz is put into this project. There is no one song that you want to skip over. I can't say more about this cd go out and find some one to lend it to you, I bet you'll buy it after you hear it."
2,just ok.,"Just to let all you folks now while it may be the voices of the girls on this cd, it was Sol de Mexico and some other artists who played all the music. The trumpets are Jose Hernandez playing both first and second trumpet. The existing trumpet players (for Reynas ) are not that good.Buy it if you like the music, but it should be called reynas doing the voices and jose providing the music."
5,Wonderful account.,This is an informative and heartwarming account of William Stafford's life and work. Beautifully written and a good read. I really enjoyed it.
1,Fraud,This is a fraudulent program that is no based on science and a class action lawsuit was filed in 2006 and the company dissolved. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
3,Not the same as the original version,"I was disappointed when I received this book. It is a shorter, modified version of the original work. The original is definitely richer in the prose and illustrations. I will be searching for an original version of the story."
5,Wonderful book!,I use this book in my classromm to read aloud and then my students have to create their own Elmer from art supplies. Elmer is just a fun character to have around.
5,Wonderful book!,This is a wonderful book! I am an art teacher and use it in my classroom to teach patterns. When I read it to my students (K-2) they laugh and giggle and just love it. It is also a great story to teach children that being different is aok and even something others may wish they were.
3,Not terribly original,"It's okay to be different, right? So I'll go against the grain and say that, quite honestly, I found this book a bit boring. So did my four-year-old boy. Perhaps because it is so short and simple? The message is so much in your face? Granted, elephants are cute, and I actually like the idea of one of them being a patchwork of colors, but there's just something about this book that, to me, fails to live up to the hype."
5,About Elmer Book,"I was very interested in this book. It has been my first purchase in Amazon and it has been good. I didn't choose a new one but a used one in good conditions, cheaper. I ordered it 11/28/09 and I have received it today 01/09/10, may be a long time to deliver but Christmas time has been in the middle."
3,Overall pretty good,"An interesting book about a remarkable doctor's travels. He comes across as quite honest, even a bit naive at times. He never gets into discussions of humanitarian philosophy (i.e. working as a surgeon for an insurgent force isn't exactly neutral). Indeed, it's unclear as to how much he knows about it in general. I think this actually makes for a better story as he is quite forthright. It is also interesting to follow his exploits with what are clearly some fly-by-night aid groups. Despite a somewhat awkward ending - in which he attempts to make philosophical connections between his work with over-stressed executives and his prior international work - overall it makes a fine read."
2,Socialist propaganda thinly disguised as a medical journal,"This book is well-written with some fascinating insights into modern medicine but most of the book is political in nature. The author admits his Socialist bias at the beginning of the book and criticizes American medical care at every opportunity.He arrogantly portrays himself as having had more ""hands-on"" education than American surgeons and that Socialist medicine is far more advanced in the areas of research and general patient care. I beg to differ! Anyone who has lived in a Socialist or Communist nation knows that this is simply not true! People wait for weeks, even months to receive surgery and are treated as less-than-human when they are finally treated."
3,how to blow up a very short story,nice material for a profile in the new yorker magazinebut 400 pages of hardcover padding is another recent exampleof surgeons and patients who have an interesting experience that is simply not enough to fill a whole book.
3,"Self-Righteous, Smug and Sanctimonious","Well, I read the reviews and bought the book, thinking it was about ""A Surgeon's Chronicle of War and Medicine"" (foolish me). It was, but only about 10% of it was. The other 90% was about this guy's whining about America's culpability in the ills of the world and how the mean old capitalists cause all the human suffering throughout the planet. He's still locked in the failed, false utopian ethos of the 60's. I guess his editor figured that to increase sales they should downplay the political and play up the medical. Well, it worked 'cause I bought the book, but I really really hate these sneaky marketing tricks and less than truthful reviews. Bottom line...Read the medical parts but flip throught the self-righteous, smug and sanctimonious rants."
1,"a very poor job of the transfers on these two movies,sound and picture were bad","Wow, this set was the worst transfers i have ever seen. i could bearly see some scenes and sound dropout happened all the time. not worth it at any price,"
1,The Insiders' Guide to Denver--4th Edition,"This guidebook was a disappointment. The index is poorly constructed making it useless for cross-referencing. For example. under the section for the Denver Botanic Gardens it lists it as a ""CC trolley stop,"" which is not listed in the index and which I could never find a reference for in the guidebook. Several of the restaurants listed in the book have gone out of business and one that we tried to find hadn't been in business for several years. When I visited a large bookstore in Denver, a display table with many recommended guidebooks to the area did not include this one. By the end of my trip, I had stopped using it."
2,Jacob's Ladder by Alan Collins,"Having just finished this short read yesterday, I feld that the ending of the story (memoir?) does not bring much closure to poor Jacob's (Jake's) life. The book reads more like a memoir versus a story. Is there a sequel to help explain what decisions Jacob will make and how he comes about understanding who and what he is? I like some of the scenery descriptions and dialogues and internal angst from Jacob. I disliked that there wasn't enough dialogue to communicate these issues between Jacob and some of his caregivers and other adults. Maybe a sequel, eh?"
3,"Pretty good book, but getting very dated","This is a good, not great, book for some basic information on Hawaii's humpback whales. But the formatting/layout/design of the book is not so good and the content is dated. If you were doing a high-school report on whales you might want to look at this book. However for reports as such this book would not be complete and you might just do as well using the Internet. So it is hard to say who would be most interested in this book.Most children would probably prefer something like Whale (DK Eyewitness Books) [Hardcover] and most adults would get more out ofWatching Giants: The Secret Lives of Whales"
3,Missing some obvious words,"I like the format of this dictionary, but within a few minutes my child could not find obvious words like ""pelvis"" -- they just aren't in it! So not recommended for 2nd grader and above."
2,"Very good songs, but not a fan of compressed remastering","This is a top notch album that is a pain to find for less then $100. I've got the remaster, and I'd love to find an original pressing. If you like Treat and/or rare aor, feel free to invite me as an amazon friend and we can talk. Pleasure Principle is an absolute classic and definitely for fans of Fate, Stage Dolls, Da Vinci, Karo, and Dokken."
5,Intrigue,"The theological science fiction novel Things Unseen by Don Moore is quite an extraordinary read. The novel kept me guessing the whole time, and it was one of those few books that I could hardly put down. Perhaps my favorite aspect of the book is how it deals with the lives of ordinary people. Most apocalyptic stories tell of presidents, dictators, the U.N. etc. In Things Unseen, you can relate to the everday men and women trying to survive and cope when history's climactic events unfold around them. This book is very well written and has the capability of keeping your attention. I highly recommend it!~"
5,My favorite Mallory novel!,I love this book. I am atually purchasing my second copy since I loaned mine out and did not get it back. great story with a great alpha male. Gotta love the men in all of Lindsey's books.
5,HOOKED!,"If you haven't read Johanna Lindsey yet then don't read this one, unless you want to be HOOKED! As soon as I read the first few pages I fell in love with the Andersons AND the Malorys! Georgie and James are brilliant! You'll never want to put this book down and when you finally do you'll be racing to read her other books on these two dynamic families! Buy it now, you won't be sorry!"
5,The best of Lindsey's books! Wonderful!,I loved this book ! It was the first JL book I had read and I think it's her best one . I fell in love with James Malory of course! And the chemistry between him and Georgie was great. And it was actually funny in parts throughout the book and made me laugh. All around I loved it and I read it again and again. I can't wait for Jeremy to get his own story!
4,The third book in the series was not a disappointment.,I like how this book is set up by the one before it and the one after it. I have to admit that my favorite character in the book was Thomas Anderson- he's a laugh a minute.
4,hot uncle #2,"Here's a blast from the past for me. I used to really love this series. My tastes have changed somewhat over the years so I haven't re-read this for quite some time, but, if nothing else, I think this may have been one of the forerunners in series about a family (both the men and women eventually having their story told.)As I recall, James was the rebel who fell for the American chick (who probably didn't look as hot as she could since she was disguised as a boy.) As I recall, this was one of the funniest of the series."
2,I was really mislead by previous reviews on this story,"I've read all of Kathleen Woodiwiss' books and most of Rosemary Rogers' books. Johanna Lindsey is about 2 levels below these two authors as far as originality, adventure and steammy, sexy love scenes. I did laugh out loud during the cabin bath scene, but that was about it. James was an English aristocratic snob along with the rest of his family of whom I found hard to warm to. Georgina was predictable along with all of her brothers. The ending was a complete let down. It really didn't make much sense and seemed like the author's time was up and had to deliver to the publisher."
5,The best one yet.,"The Malory Books are the best romance novels ever written. At one glance you will fall into love with the family. But hey Where is the book about James's son?this book has all the classics. Adventure, Passion, and humor. It took me into a family that seems like the one you always wished to be a part of. You cheer for James when he proves that even he, a man who swore to never become leg-shackled, can find love true love. And the groans of the people when it looks as if they are never going to be togther. The whole book is spectaular. But then again WHAT ELSE WOULD IT BE!!!!!!! IT'S A NOVEL BY JOHANNA LINDSEY!!!!!!! AND A MALORY NOVEL TO BOOT!!!!!!!!"
1,A True Case of TSTL,"I do love sea faring historicals so I thought this one would be for me. It wasn't. I can forgive a lot when reading historical romance, but the prose has to be adequate and the dialog should sound like dialog and not just awkward.The prose and dialog are terrible here and don't get me started on the execrable Scottish phonetic dialog. But my real issues are with the characters. All the men are immature babies with 2mm fuses that send them into tantrums. The heroine? Georgina? IS TOO STUPID TO LIVE. If she were a real person natural selection would weed her right out of the gene pool before you could say Watson and Crick.This is book is badly written, badly plotted, and contains characters I'd like to drown. But if you're looking for something that's so terrible it's almost hilarious? Try this. You can make a drinking game out every time the Hero calls someone ""Dear boy."""
3,"Just okay, won't keep me reading the series","Very predictable lovestory-hatestory- lovestory on and on until ""I love you even though I said I never would marry or love anyone"", you know the kind of story I am talking about. Shallow me, I did enjoy the story, but it wasn't very deep in development. I read it because of a recommendation for a strong alpha and bodice ripper. The recommendation didn't lie, that is exactly what it was with a sassy virgin heroine who didn't mind giving it up even though she had been saving it for 22 years. The hero was a total rascal with seduction on his mind the whole time. There was a lot of fist fights and stealing/kidnapping between her brothers and the hero. It seemed repetitive. Other books from this series were recommended to me as well, I don't think I will move them to the top of the list at this point. I might have made a mistake of not reading the books in order, but it was pretty easy to determine the previous stories."
5,the malorys series,"wish the malorys stories didnt end they kept me up half the night, she never disapoints me dont have a favorite because they all are"
2,Audiobook not so good,Actual reading was better than the audio version. I liked this book when I originally read it a few years ago. The audio version (abridged) misses way too much of the story and plot. So it is hard to get into the story.
4,effective but sharp,my 10 pound poodle doesn't really like being combed by this on her bony areas like her chest or her sensitive skin areas like near her belly. i think it's because the bristles are quite sharp. she does like it on her neck and back tho. i guess because there is more meat and fur over there.
2,too sharp for puppies.,Not a good brush for puppies with any lenth hair..the bristoles bent and it made it harder to use and painful. Would not use on puppies or dogs period.
5,Finally found it !,I have a very large Goldendoodle and I have been trying to find a comb or brush that would deal with his coat. He has long hair and also has the undercoat. This is the first brush that I can honestly say I have been pleased with. I would highly recommend its purchase. The construction seems to be quite durable and its easy to hold and work with. Well worth the money.
3,Bristles bend easily,"This is my first slicker brush, so maybe I was expecting too much. The first use the bristles around the edges have started to bend. I understand that they are supposed to be flexible, but I expected a little more for durability. As a brush it performs its job well. The dogs seem to love the way it feels when I'm brushing them and it removes mats pretty easily, so I still consider it a good purchase."
4,works great,"I have a thick haired Caucasian Shepard mix with long coarse fur and a Afghan mutt one with thick/soft but not long fur and this handles both just fine. For those considering a ""self cleaning brush"" this is dead simple to clean. The one caveat i guess is that the bristles are sharp (?) i managed to really scratch myself with it (read blood, and i do farm work so i don't have particularly delicate hands) so be careful?"
1,Useless and cheap,"I personally believe this is a useless and cheap product. The bristles arrived all bent and out of shape, the handle was cheap and everything about this was light and cheap and poor design and feel."
1,Cheap,Don't waste your money. Handle fell off after 5th use. I have 2 Golden Retrievers that I try to brush every couple of days and have had the same problem with other brushes. I felt the handle work loose after only 2 uses and fell off completety at 5 uses. This product may o.k. for a small dog with a thin coat.
2,Not great,"when I opened the product, most of the teeth were bend and required me to fix. My dog does not necessary like this brush however. She squirms and the metal brissles appear to hurt his skin."
5,Best Dog Brush,"I have purchased many, many, many brushes for my dogs throughout the years and I finally found one that works great. Not only does it comb through my dogs hair cleanly and without pulling, it is so easy to remove the hair from the bristles when I'm done. I am going to order the smaller version too for my little dog."
3,"Works for one dog, not the other","I have two dogs - one with thin hair (schnauzer mix) and one with VERY thick (double coat) hair (Bichon). Works super great with the schnoodle, not well at all on the Bichon."
5,Skapulario is one of the best Ska bands!!!,This cd brings out some of the best qualities of Skapulario. If thier CD doesn't make you want to skank i don't know what will. Each song has a different flavor. Ska Ska Ska!!!!!!
2,no classic licks,"I see all the blues lessons on you tube, great fantastic licks and playing, but they're very hard to learn from just watching,and they never say if it comes with notation, which I don't think they do, and I can read music,this book has the notes and fret numbers ,but no clasic licks at all, you need to learn that great sound to go with the lesson ,this book doesn't have it, his book blues guitar is much better ,and guitar scales is excelent..."
5,The Italian Army 1940-45 (3),"Well written, informative and much more detailed information than I expected. Very good photos and color drawings of uniforms and equipment along with loads of historical information."
2,Hindsight in our time.,"Much has been said on the subject of colonial racism, and this still leaves a bitter tang in the throats of most historicially learned people. Still, we don't need this book. Conrad's Heart of Darkness is placed in the context of his time, and even when skimming the novell, one get the image that it is an attack on the imperialism of that time. Firchow goes after the wrong novell."
4,"Great, except for the beginning and the ending","All in all, this is the one audiobook one should acquire if one is a fan of Q. Written by the actor who plays him, you need never worry that he will act out of character. The way that Q's journey goes is an intriguing philosophical journey. The problem is that the begging secion and the next section is done by someone else, and it justs drags the overall stry down, to the point where it seems it hardly has an ending at all.For the record, the story takes place after the episode of ST: Voyager where Q and another have a baby."
1,"Nice, but not durable","I bought this unit about 6 months ago after my prior pump failed after many years. This pump has now failed, but not until it overheated the plug and could have caused damage to the socket into which it was plugged. It's inexpensive, but the price probably reflects the quality."
5,Fast and Compact,"It inflates fast. The cord is long and wraps around the bottom of the unit, which is convenient and keeps it from getting tangled. Everything (plug, hose and adapters) can be tucked in at the top of the unit, in the little storage space, which keeps everything really compact."
1,I am a mechanic - Same one they sell at Walmart - Complete garbage - Fell apart after one use.,"Like the title says this is the same one they sell at Walmart. Which does not make it a bad product...........the product makes it a bad product. It did inflate the tire in decent time (for as small as the compressor is). But.......I purchased this to just leave in the car to use during an emergency. Today I had to use it:The bad things about it is that the attachment that goes on the tire is hard to get off and on. Also, THE FIRST TIME I USED IT THE 12V CHARGER SIDE BROKE OFF INSIDE OF THE OUTLET AND STAYED IN THERE. I needed to turn the car off and get needle nose pliers to get it out. Complete garbage. Spend your money on a better one."
2,Rather noisy,"For those who want to know, the electrical specifications for thisdevice are 15 amp draw from a 12 volt source; it appears that Amazonis incapable of providing this information. Amazon sells this devicetogether with a ""Universal AC to DC Car Cigarette Lighter SocketAdapter (US Plug)"" as a ""Frequently Bought Together"" set; one might beinclined to believe that these two devices would work together butif one checks the actual specifications for the adapter, one findsthat the adapter is only capable of delivering 300 milliAmps, that is,about 2% of the power the inflator needs. If you actually try thiscombination, the adapter appears to protect itself by delivering nothing.Simply put, the adapter is useless for powering the inflator."
2,Slime COMP02 12 Volt Tire Inflator,"I bought this item after reading review stating that it can be used to inflate bicycle tires. Beware that it does not come with a wall charger--the only way to power it is to plug it into the power outlet of a car. Moreover, the power outlet of a car has to be 15 amps or higher for it to work. Unfortunately, my car's power outlet does not allow devices that use more than 10 amps."
3,Slime™ at $19.99 vs. Harbor Freight at $7.98,"The Slime inflator does work. However, the user needs to shut it down (after eight minutes of use) for not less than another eight to fifteen minutes. Because the Slime™ inflator works slowly...very slowly, expect to spend a good deal of time when inflating a set of four tires that may need adjustment of inflation. Whereas, the Harbor Freight inflator seems to work faster and to not require constantly being shut down to inflate one tire ... or four tires. 'Caveat emptor.'"
5,"Very nice, handy item","Bought this item a few weeks ago when there was a small leak in my tire that I couldn't find. Does the job very well, from flat to 35psi it takes probably 5 min, which is OK for me. It is small enough so I can leave it in the car. It is rather loud, but who cares?I would definitely recommend this."
1,Not useful,"The meter is not accurate!When you double check the pressure, you'll find the pressure is different from the one that you just finished inflating.Though it is cheap, the inflator without accuracy is still useless."
1,"It Worked Twice, So That's Something","This thing was cheap, and you can tell. The needle stays at 70 PSI now, and the valve stopped working. This thing couldn't inflate a bike tire now; it just makes a lot of noise."
1,Piece of Junk!!,Used it ONCE and then tried it again a few months later and no go. Just won't function at all. Fuse tested OK. Tried to return to Amazon and said it was past the return period. Never been that ripped off by a product sold on Amazon and then to be jacked by Amazon as well. Pretty pathetic!Stay away from this product unless you want to expensively fill up one tire!!!
2,Works but not great,"Pros: it does what it's designed to do. Been using it for a few years and still works.Cons: 1) No on/off switch. Gotta unplug it to make it stop, which is dumb. 2) Super noisy. Good idea to wake up your neighbors on weekend early morning. 3) Pumps slow. If your car tire is flat you gotta wait a few minutes. 4) pressure gauge is off by 2 psi 5) you lose 2 psi every time you unplug it from tire valve"
2,Great the 9x I used it,"Was skeptical b/c the box seemed to have been opened, and there was a scratch on the side. But I needed it for bike and car tires, so I kept it. It inflated bike tires well and fast - mountain in about 3 or 4 minutes, road in less. Car or SUV tires were done after 5 - 8 minutes, although it was a little tricky to keep flat and stable b/c the hose was not that long, but it was fine. Never tried the ball nozzles. Used it 9x and the inflation feature just stopped after filling one mountain bike tire. the light still worked though, so i know it's compressor related. for the cost, it inflated well, but it's not acceptable to not last even a dozen fills. 1.50 in quarters is enough for 4 car tires and 1-2 bike tires. I would have done better filling up at the station at this price."
2,The Hipster Spies With His Little Eye----Nonfunctional gizmo,"I must say, a fairly large number of reviewers describe receiving a pump that simply doesn't work.Alas, I am one of them.At no time could I get this pump to work, not for a moment.***Product quality seems rather low.***You might be wise to buy something different.I suspect faulty power cords.I cannot recommend this pump.The Hipster gives it a Thumbs Down.BTW--For inflating Bicycle tires, I bought, and hereby recommend:Gamecraft Gamecraft Heavy Duty Hand Pumpmuch better, and with a built-in pressure gauge."
2,Poorly organized; significant errors.,"Returned this book after purchase as I found the format confusing (animals grouped by habitat as opposed to geographic location - try explaining to a 2.5 yr old that he will never stumble across a duck-billed platypus in his back yard here in the U.S.). Also, a prominent photo of an elk bore a caption describing the ""moose"" pictured therein."
1,Crap...,"This video is a complete waste of money. It's old (eighties?), footage is crap and it doesn't tell you much at all. You will find better material on youtube for free. Too bad really, because there are not a lot of travel videos on the Philippines out there."
3,Perfect for Family Night,"Gave this to my Mother in Law and Aunt, so they could watch it over the holidays with family, and be unofficial tour guides for a trip down their country's memory lane. I was told it was a huge success, and a great gift."
2,Not a very helpful tutorial,"Since it was so affordable, I decided to give it a try since I wanted to be more advanced on a few of the office programs and learn a couple of others from scratch. If you're looking for an overall general guide through the different features of Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Access, etc, then this is fine but if you're a beginner, or not at all familiar with certain programs of Office, then this isn't helpful enough. Unfortunately, the ones that are really good cost a bit more."
1,No really hands on experience,"I bought this for my wife to learn the basics of Office software. She was disappointed that it didn't really allow her to work in the program, just follow along with instructions to do various projects in Word, Excel, etc. If you're looking for a self-directed tutorial, this isn't it. And good luck getting the $[...] rebate check. Three months after submitting my rebate paperwork, I'll still getting the runaround from Encore, the folks who handle the rebate program."
3,Great fusion.,"Neil Larsen is a great keyboardist and composer and his 2 previous efforts are among the few fusion records released in the 70s that hold up after time. This was largely due to Neil's avoiding the trendy synth stuff and using a Hammond organ as his instrument of choice. His partner, guitarist, Buzz Feiten also contributed his stellar talents to these recordings to make them even more enduring. This Cd released in the late 80s suffers from some of the synth crazy sounds he had previously avoided, but still has its moments which include a searing tenor solo from Michael Brecker on ""Carnival"" and great playing once again from Larsen and Feiten. Let's get someone out there to release those 2 earlier efforts on CD or download. I see so many comments on Youtube begging for both!!!!"
3,Should've been better....,"God, I love Neil Larsen's organ playing. Unfortunately, it's almost entirely missing here, replaced by synthesizers - lots of them. Neil's ability with a melody is so good that ""Alborada,"" ""Last Call,"" and ""Through Any Window"" still sound pretty good, but only his remake of Booker T's ""Hip Hug-Her"" features the organ. Buzzy Feiten's guitar sound has changed since the early '80s and it's not nearly as intense and unique here. I would've loved to have heard all these songs done by Neil on ORGAN but he didn't choose a single one to redo on his Orbit project, even though the melodies here are in some cases better than the ones he chose to feature there. A so-so album that could have been much, much better."
3,The Pictures,"The best feature of this book is the full color. It's a lavish production; very nearly a coffee table book.The accompanying text was a little obtuse (at least to me), a little judgemental (okay, a lot), and defined the medium of artists' books in a way that I just don't agree with.Worth having, for the images and for the impetus to clarify just exactly *why* I disagreed with certain pronouncements, but can't hold a candle to other recent books about artists' books."
3,Hurry up and take notes!,"Fast-paced storyline that, as much as I hate to admit it, got a little scattered and confusing. Towards the end of the book I began to think that I would be enjoying it more if I had taken notes, thereby enabling me to keep up with the myriad characters, some suddenly resurgent from earlier parts of the book. It's almost as if Greenwood sacrificed depth of character in favor of quanity of characters. All in all a good read anyway, if you don't mind investing quite a bit of concentration in the plot -- not a terribly difficult task if you are a big fan of the Forgotten Realms/Elminster (can there be one without the other?). Tips for reading this book: 1)Once you start, don't put it down, and 2)Read fast."
1,please shoot me,"...The first 2 books of the series had a great stories but I fail to see what is supposed to be happening in this third. Nothing is happening and Elminster is reduced to a puppet of Mystra. If he's the greatest wizard in Faerun, how come Mystra has to save his butt in every battle.Some of my favorite series are Icewind Dale, Dark Elf trilogy, Starlights and shadows, and The war of the spider queen. As I said before the first 2 books of the Elminster series were very well written so recomend them as well. If have the same taste as me, stay away from the temptation of elminster."
3,Too many characters and not enough plot,"This is the third Elminster book I have read in the series. (I am reading them in order.) I think the author lost focus on weaving a tightly knit tale or strongly developed characters as compared to the two previous novels. There were too many characters in the story, which made it confusing, and you did not really care about them or their plight. Elminster, the character continues to evolve in his role as the Chosen of Mystra although I am beginning to wonder how harsh a mistress Mystra is going to be. While marginal, there is enough plot to keep the reader engaged. I still want to know exactly what happened to Myth Drannor though. That seems an obvious future story or a BIG hole."
2,2 and 1/2 stars,"This an acceptable entry level book to fantasy, it doesn't have any real depth or much in the way of originality. If your looking for a moderately enjoyable book that you can blow through in an evening then its right up your alley.There are however much better books to be found at the same reading level."
1,"Elminster: here, there, everywhere",This book was a tremendous let down for me. Mr. Greenwood's first two Elminster novels were excellent but in this last book I felt as if the story was very confused. While the other books had an interesting plot this last novel seemed to be about a cast of characters just thrown in with witty dialogue. I had the impression that Mr. Greenwood wanted to show off many aspects of the Forgotten Realms through Elminster's eyes but it gave the effect of a tour rather than a coherent story. I certainly hope that Mr. Greenwood will write another Elminster novel but return to the same magic he used to write the 1st two books.
3,Almost 4 stars,"This was an enjoyable light, but informative book about presidencies from a different perspective than most. I differ from one of the panning reviews in that I thought it was refreshingly not leftist liberal journalism. The author seemed to take a non-political view of the characters with an expected sympathetic eye towards the first ladies. I also found some factual discrepancies that a fact checker should have found which - as always - puts a cloud on the author's credibility; i.e.: Ford was an All-American center for Mich, not a star quarterback at Yale. But her countless quotes from insiders were well chosen, very informative and interesting. She did her homework on those. If there were half stars to give, I'd give this a three and one-half. Certainly worth the time."
5,great read!,If you're a 50 something looking for a great book to curl up with - try this one. You may remember most of these First Ladies and this book will make them come alive for you. Great summer (or winter) read!
3,Enjoyable and informative,"This was an enjoyable light, but informative book about presidencies from a different perspective than most.

But her countless quotes from insiders were well chosen, very informative and interesting. She did her homework on those. If there were half stars to give, I'd give this a three and one-half. Certainly worth the time."
3,Fast and enjoyable,"I don't think this book is as awful as previously stated. If you take it for what it is - a gossipy, fast reading analysis on presidential marriages - it is enjoyable. The author did make several mistakes on common knowledge information. She never mentioned the fact that Betty Ford was previously married (which most everyone knows) and she stated that upon entering office, Richard Nixon had dinner with his daughters and their husbands. This is incorrect, since Tricia Nixon wasn't married at the time her father became president. She was married in the White House."
1,GOSSIP--NOTHING BUT GOSSIP,"Hidden Power is a misnomer. I mean after all if the power, or the subject of the book, was really hidden how was the author able to write about it?? The book is a tease and much of the information has been reported before in various tabliods. For example, the closenest of the Carters and the isolation of Richard Nixon is old hat, so when I was reading it I fealt as if I were listening to a broken record. There is an old saying: ""Where is the beef?"", but with this book I have to ask: ""Where is the new?"". Answer: I can't tell you."
2,Good Bible - Lousy Leather,"Excellent bible and print.ConsThe leather binding quality is highly questionable. The front cover, the leather is not even spread out evenly. I am surprised that the quality control even pass this item.The only reason I am not currently returning the product is because it takes 1 month for it to be shipped to Asia and exchanging it would mean i have to wait another month.I am very disappointed with the makers of this bible."
4,Pleased,"The Bible had most of the qualities I was looking for:Larger print for speaking and teaching fromLeatherLine by lineQuick gospel reference in the backthicker paperThe only disappointment is it was too large. I was hoping for a slightly smaller, thinner Bibleand I was hoping for the leather to be a little softer. It was a gift for a young man beginning his ministry."
4,Amercian standard bible,"This Bible has exactly what I was looking for, to be used out in the world when contacting lost souls, easy to read, size is very good easy to carry."
3,"Great bible not so much ""ultrathin""",I have owned thinlines and really like the size/print-size ratio so I was surprised to find a large print ultra thin. I was also surprised when I received it because there is nothing ultrathin about it. It is a large print large bible. Very disappointed
4,Mostly love it!,"I love most things about this Bible: Overall size is good, font is very readable (especially helpful for public reading). The only drawback is that the binding is pretty rigid; wish it were more flexible. Otherwise, an excellent choice."
4,NASB Large print study bible,"The print is not very lage to be a ""large print"" volume. I bought it to give to a geriatric; yet the print is still not large enough for her to read without extra magnification."
5,New Age master,"Have had this album at least 4 other times in my life. So good it was ""borrowed"" by others and never returned. But, to say the least, I loved the music so much I replaced it immediately."
3,Nice look,They install in seconds. Open your hood and pop them on! They look good and fit perfectly. I added some pictures of them on my Jeep Grand Cherokee and I am satisfied.
3,"Good truck, but not what advertised","My nephew and I are happy with the product; however, based on the product description from the manufacturer, I was expecting something much bigger and heavier."
2,"Average information, not very good recipes","The information in this book is OK for the beginner, but out of date, and the recipes are not very good. Many call for the use of several cups of corn sugar in the fermentation and nowhere near enough hops during the boil. The resulting beer tasted like alcoholic, carbonated syrup. You can get all of this beginner information for free on the internet. There are so many other good books out there on brewing that I would avoid this one."
4,The First Round,"Hell's Kitchen Season 1 is a nice start to the show. It's not crazy but that allows the cast to grow on you. However there is a clear divide between chef's who have no hope, chef's who start fine but are on a sinking ship, and the chef's that demonstrate potential to stay in the game longer. But even that last group has strong/weak division. I enjoyed this season but it is slower then other seasons.For me it worked as I enjoyed this cast but for some it won't for many understandable reasons. I like this season but it's one of the lower seasons I like."
4,If you can't take the heat...,"I didn't know anything about this show until I started watching the current season (fifth or sixth, I think?) and got hooked. This first season is very good, not AS good, but very good. While the most recent season used people who are already chefs, this season used a few people who were professional chefs but most had other occupations. This kind of led me to believe that the pros would have an advantage but don't count on it. This season set is not censored, so if you watch it on TV with the kids be aware that nothing is bleeped out!"
4,Hell's Kitchen season 1,This was a very good show and it arrived in good shape and on time.I was very happy with it.
3,Ron With Bobby Womack,"Ron Wood plays with Bobby Womack on this one, so it has a more bluesy feel than ""I've Got Me Own Album to Do"", but I like the songwriting on the earlier release a little more. Still an interesting release that shows Ron as a front man, as opposed to a guitar player only."
4,The Case of the MIssing Husband,"This is a pretty good movie--filmed in a style similar to ""Under the Flag of the Rising Sun""Newlyweds- Teiko and Kenichi--are married for a week when Kenichi disappears without a trace-and we are shown Teiko's attempts to discover what happened and how.She finds that her husband was an ex-policeman involved with prostitutes-is there a connection to this and his disappearance?Soon her brother-in-law is poisoned--and another young woman commits suicide--apparently, after the suicide of her common law husband. Through a maze of false leads and disinformation-Teiko finally discovers what happened to her husband and how!A very good mystery--my only complaint being that some of the transitions between scenes are a little too abrupt. All in all---a very good movie--well worth watching! Yoshiko Kuga does an excellent job as the abandoned wife!Black & White--with sub-titles!"
5,Masterful,"This is not a ""dim copy"" of anything. The movie might be in black and white, but its psychological analysis is expertly done with many shades of grey. One of the best winter movies ever. The snow sits on top of the buildings in this movie almost as heavy as the moral burdens oppressing its characters. Much more memorable - in terms of shots - than any Hitchcock movie. Don't miss it."
2,A DIM COPY OF AMERICAN NOIR MYSTERIES,"They got the look right. In fact, it's a explicit lift of the the film noir of the 40's and 50's. But there's no mystery here, just a string of events to lull the viewer to sleep, capped by a jumbled explanation of mundane events.Not unlike Nomura's THE CASTLE OF SAND. Take two to sleep."
3,"LUMINOUS SETTING, MURKY PLOT","Concert Of Ghosts is a well written psychologically complex, stunningly atmospheric page turner which starts with an absurd premise and gets even nuttier; a tense, tingling puzzler."
1,Esperanto CD... Guacala!!! Fuchila!! Horrible,"Quiero decir que, después de oir la musica de este disco en el radio, ya me cansé, pues está horrible y no sé que le oyen... Les recomiendo que ya no se traumen y que escuchen BUENAS canciones. La única buena de Kabah, yo pienso que es ""La Calle de las Sirenas"", y si no saben lo que es Esperanto, pues que se callen y no canten tonterías. Al CD le doy un UNO por ser chafo y naco."
2,Did not work with all printers,Did not work with Brother laser but still worked with UPS Thermal printer. Professional networking service could not even get this to work properly. No support.
1,Waste of time and money,"Relatively easy setup...BUT, very limited bidirectional compatability. Does not work well with multifunction printers. Either have to do a ""cancel"" to print or with a mutifunction printer with a fax, always shows the device as busy and cannot print at all."
2,A long let-down,"I was excited by Joyce's return to historical romance, but this novel was long and, frankly, stupid. The reactions of the heroine are unbelievable, going against social mores of the time--she far too willingly goes to bed with a ""pirate!"" I also have an issue with her ""best friend"" being a slave who will be sold off. The most interesting parts of the novel were the references to the War of 1812, a part of American history that tends to be ignored."
3,I Cried out because my annoyance knew no bounds!,"Is it just me or does anyone else notice how Brenda Joyce repeats phrases over and over??? Im talking about ""knew no bounds"" and ""she cried out"" among others these must have been repeated like 50 times! Every time I read them I got more annoyed! Can't she think of another way to explain how angry someone is besides their anger (or frustration or sadness) ""knew no bounds""? And what exactly are the characters ""crying out"" all the time. TELL US! I'm sorry but I think if she tried alittle harder the books could have been so much better. Unbelievably I read The Masqerade after this book and she is STILL using these phrases over and over! Get a thesaurus or something BRENDA!"
2,"Great Start, Great End... The Middle? Not So Much.","The first chapter of this book had me captivated. The story really went down hill from there. Don't get me wrong, there were a few good parts, but the characters kept having the same conversations over and over again. The last few chapters were as good as the first, but everything leading up to that point just really weren't worth it."
1,The Prize,"This is the worst piece of junk she's ever written and over the years, thestyle and quality of her books has deteriorated tremendously."
1,Ridiculous,"Definitely not the high standard of writing that you would expect from Brenda Joyce. The heroine Virginia was quit simpy ridiculous, whiny, and a doormat."
2,Disappointed!,"I am a huge Brenda Joyce fan, and I've read everything she's published (including out-of-print novels), however, I was very disappointed in The Prize. The hero, Devlin, is great. I love alpha male heros. BUT, I hated, HATED the heroine, Virginia. She was a DOORMAT!!! This is a pet peeve of mine. I love Brenda's historicals, and was disappointed that this one was not up to par."
1,This was a total mess.,"I have to agree with so many of the other reviewers. I absolutely started to loath this book and the author for creating such a story. I couldn't believe what a sniveling weakling the ""heroine"" was. Give me a break...who wants to be treated like a trollop and spit upon at every turn. How could the main character Virginia come off as being so strong upon introduction and become so weak? I was sooooo disappointed in this book. I found myself on more than one occasion just flipping through some of the pages in an attempt to just get it over with. I honestly detested this story."
2,Strong female character turns into a wimp.,"I liked this book at first, because the main character, Virginia, was a strong spunky woman. Somewhere along the way she turns into a wimp, and starts taking tons of abuse from the man she loves. She is intent on ""saving"" him but it's hard to feel any support for her when she keeps taking his rotten behavior toward her. Not for me."
2,Seemed to go on FOREVER....,"This book was very tedious and several times I thought it should have ended! It almost seemed like Ms. Joyce had all these ideas from the time period and wanted to jampack them into one book! Also, the main character seemed spunky and a total tomboy (can shoot, survey fields, etc.), but once she's on the boat and in England, she's almost totally helpless once she puts on a dress. Also, after she runs away from the boarding school, it's never mentioned again? Seriously. Plus the boat rides across the Atlantic I'm sure took longer than how it was written. Half the time I was reading this book, I wanted to put it away because I was so bored and wanting it to progress! The beginning made it out to be somewhat interesting, but it never lived up to it. Ms. Joyce's other books are so much better. I wouldn't read this book again."
1,Tossed the book in the trash half way through,"From the description on the back of the book, I thought this might be an interesting read. I guess the saying dont judge a book by the description should come into play. The logic is missing. Here is a young women, kidnapped at sea, an innocent, and next thing you know she is all too willing to crawl into bed with the very man she vowed to hate. I have to be honest, I got half way through this book and tossed in the trash. It was that bad."
5,One of the best I've ever read!!!!,"This book was the one the made me a fan of Brenda Joyce. I've reread it a couple of times & want to do so again. I loved both the heroine and the hero, unlike other reviewers on here. I've read allot of historical romances & this one has stayed in my heart & mind for along time. Give it a chance & see for yourself, its worth it. Reading the negative reviews on here made me realize not to always trust other readers opinions, because honestly if they consider this bad I don't want to read what they consider good! lol"
4,The Prize,I'm hooked on Brenda Joyce! She is a great writer and I'm enjoying her book and books very much. This book will keep you wanting to read on. Very good read!!
4,Good book..horrible editing,"This book is pretty accurate about life as a Nuke. Dead on about the working hours and crappy working conditions and constant long underways that kind of make you feel like a stranger in your own country. New Rock and Rap groups spring up while you're gone and unless your Home front is keeping you informed, you're out of the loop. And the stuff about the officers is true, too. More pay for less time on the ship that they stay, is how I like to put it.It's good. Just wish this guy had gotten it edited."
1,Sounds like someone needs to let go of some anger.,"While some of the accounts in this book are fairly accurate, some are greatly skewed. Having also been on the boat at this time, I can tell you that this is someone who is truly bitter toward alot of people. Only someone who knows that he is skewing events would not put his real name. So, if you want to read a book about the navy that should be classified as fiction, you would be better served going to your local recruiting station and asking them for some info. As for this 'book of actual events', don't bother. Rather ask someone who was actually there and had enough work to do that they didn't have time to write books."
1,horrible,"Reading this book is like reading a 1st graders homework. His accounts of nuke life are extremely off base and his recolection of actual events in the MMR are extremely biased. This is a horrible book, which is just a reminder why this ""author"" was never successful in the US NAVY. Also, I ""Dimkade"" remember consoling this guy for over an hour more than once while he cried because he couldn't figure out how to fit in."
1,not impressed,It just didn't hold up to the excellent standard of music coming from Cross Movement Records.
2,A disappointing late effort for this Fela fan,"TEACHER DON'T TEACH ME NONSENSE was released in 1986, a time when Fela Kuti's output was slowing considerably. Performed with his band Egypt 80, the album continues his Afrobeat style and love of long, slowly developing songs. We have only two tracks here, ""Teacher Don't Teach Me Nonsense"" and ""Look and Laugh"", each around 30 minutes long.Compared to the classic achievements of the 1970s and early 1980s, TEACHER DON'T TEACH ME NONSENSE feels like a minor effort. The production is far too smooth, and the pace lacks fire and is downright lethargic. Fela's vocals sound bored, and the songwriting of the track, another defense of African values, retreads old ground to much reduced effect. The strong horns and exotic drumming that were a staple of Afrobeat are largely absent here. The result strips Fela's music of that wild passion that he made his name with. If you want to start with Fela, better get ZOMBIE, J.J.D. or UNKNOWN SOLDIER."
5,classic vid that brings back childhood memories,"I can remember watching this as a kid too. It brings back so many wonderful memories of Halloween and my childhood in the 1980's. This movie has stood the test of time. My own children love it now as well. I recommend this movie to all who enjoy good, clean entertainment."
5,a wonderful halloween tradition,"I remember waiting for this movie to come on tv everytime halloween came around, my favorite part was always ""teeny tiny bat, teeny tiny bat"", for those of you who have had the pleasure to see this movie I'm sure you know what I am talking about. I hope that it is re-released so my daughter can enjoy it as much as I did."
5,Awesome Halloween Special for the whole family!,I remember this movie from many moons ago and it was great then. I now share it with my kids and see the same magic in their eyes as I had in mine. Thumbs up!
4,A Good value.,I searched all over for the best price for a battery. This 9 cell seemed to be an excellant buy. It was 50% charged up when I installed it which is understandable. It seems to be performing well at this point. Its' success will be judged in one year as all of my other batteries gave out around that time. One concern I had was if the 9 cell would fit on top of the docking station. It would have been useful if the ad would have said that it would. It fits just fine. The battery hangs over the docking station back with no problem.
1,They fell apart after a couple hours of use.,"These gloves are horrible. The seams split open after a couple hours of use, and the stuffing went everywhere. Don't bother wasting your money."
2,These gloves dont last long,"I had these gloves for about 2 months. One glove is already ripped open and exposed, so I have to buy another pair. Becareful with these gloves..."
4,Innovative Moog Work,"This is an excellent album if you are interested in Moog synthesizer recordings and recordings of impressive production technique. Also, the music is very good; a mixture of jazz and baroque with a smattering of voices and sounds cleverly used, makes this album thoroughly enjoyable on all levels.I recommend it highly. Few albums from the early 70's were this well done and this unusual."
5,humbling,"Read the book. Be prepared to be humbled. The author is a Mormon and he uses scriptural references in his writings, but they all make sense, don't let it deter you if you are not Mormon, you will still get good advise from this book. I am still wrapping my mind around the concept that we are all so damn critical and the damage it does to others and to ourselves... I hope to use the concepts taught in this book to have a better relationship with my kids and their families and my spouse. I hope I am not too old to learn..."
4,"Good book, good prep for the test","I had this book, the Sybex book and the Cisco Press books. After seeing the age of the information in the Sybex book I quit using it and used this and the Cisco Press books (practical studies: Switching and the BCMSN study guide).This was a good cram before the test. It covers pretty much everything you will get in the test. I passed the first time! (Not by much, but I passed)Keep in mind that this test is very hard and you will be required to have some practical information for the router sims and will need to know how to troubleshoot networking, in addition to memorizing all the concepts. This was not an easy test."
3,Not what I expected,"The item was not what I expected, there were some loss pages. So I did not think it was up to standard."
3,it was okay,its was okay not as good as the field guide but it had info that the field guide didn't have .
5,"Werther's Candy,","Customers really enjoys the Werthers Original candy, when shopping in my store,Thank you for such fast service, Will be back,,,,,"
3,190 pcs = 2 lbs of candy,"Per the nutritional information found online, each piece is 5 grams, making 190 pieces weigh in at 2 lbs 1.5 oz, not the 4 lbs indicated in the product details."
4,Can't Beat the Deal,"Hard to beat the deal to get two towers for 299 with free shipping.I was a little disappointed when I initially heard them but the break in factor is very true. They are definitely better for the higher range sounds, and not as good with the mid range.They also look great as well. Really, I looked around a lot for different towers and nothing could compete with this price."
4,Good Reference Text,Good reference text for deminision and clearly illustrated. Only drawback is the data this is based on is a number of years old. That said it is still highly relevant.
5,Good buy,"I didn't actually see the book. I bought it for my daughter who is in college and had it sent directly to her, but she said it was great! It was a good buy!"
4,a must have!,I am currently in design school and I will say that this is one book you will reference all the time and should be in everyone's library!
3,"Not the best, but worthwhile none the less",I bought this book for school. It's redundant and some portions don't make much sense. But anyone trying to design a space that is functional and takes human size and shape into account should take a look at this book.
4,Good Book,I was told this would be a great book to have by several of my interior design professors and they were right!I use it all the time for realistic measurements and info for how people move through space. So worth the money!
2,Stone Breaker,"My wife has stones between both kidneys and her bladder, one is 3mm and the other is 5mm. A stent was placed at the location of the 5mm, so we did not expect the Stone Breaker to help very much on that side. So when she had a scan done, both were exactly the same size. So she will be having surgery to remove the larger of the two. At this point I do not know if both will be removed, I am praying that they do, or that the Stone Breaker has done its job and broke down at least the smaller one without the stent.That being said, I cannot give this product a high marking because as far as I know at this point, it has not done anything."
1,lousy,The product did not do anything for my small kidney stone. It is called stone breaker but it does not work.
5,Stone Breaker,"The second bottle was longer coming than I thought because I ordered two and only one came, but the company was excellent to work with. They were very nice and even helped track down the 2nd bottle. I like Stone Breaker for kidney stones. It seems to help me along with Marshmellow Root. Also... the Stone Breaker is taken with water and does not taste bad. Kind of has a celery taste (my opinion). I will order it again."
2,Just another photo book...,"This book is just a small photo book. It has a huge amount of pages, but each one has just one picture. It worths 10 bucks, but will not increase your knowledge about wristwatches, since its descripions are very poor ( it doesn't contain exact made year, caliber of movement etc ).Flávio Maia"
1,No more couch wobble,"Worst book I've ever seen.Different catagories such as Mechanical, Automatic, Complicated etc.Seems to concentrate on particular brands and throw's in a few other's to break up the monotony.On automatics. Shows 3 pic's of the JLC Power reserve. rolex is represented by two vintage and 7 modern.60% of the watches come from JLC, Lip and Rolex. 20% from Heuer, Omega and Zenith and some Breitling. Other 20% are from some know and unknown companies.I'd ship it back, but the s/h cost wouldn't give me much of a refund.One look was enoughAt least the couch won't wobble anymoreDON"
2,"Some nice pictures, but nothing of value to the collector","A lot of the watches in this collection are fairly expensive, and I'm thinking that anyone who is collecting at this level would have no use for this book at all."
5,The best carb. parts cleaner I have found,"I have several tried to use other ""carb. parts cleaners"" that would'nt touch the varnish, deposits and gunk. I used it to rebuild a carb from 1954 pick up, Which has been sitting for 17 years(thought carb was too far gone for rebuild). Soaked them over night, I did'nt recognize them when I returned the next day, almost completly clean, what gunk was left was loose and easily removed."
5,Worked like a charm!,"Rebuilt the carburetor on my Nissan Outboard and still had problems. Was advised to pull it and give it a hearty soak, which I did, and now all's well. This stuff works to really clean up in those impossible to reach locations!"
4,Works great,Product worked very well for rebuilding a carburator. I am currently working on cleaning bolts and misc items for a motor rebuild. Can states it is not environmentally friendly so I am not sure how to dispose of materia when depleted.
3,Good but not great,"I soaked a Rochester quadrajet in this and it did an OK job, but I was expecting more. The directions say to dip for 15-20mins. Books i have say 2-3 hours. So, i tried a few pieces at 2-3 hours and the main carb pieces, throttle body, air horn etc, I left soaking overnight. it definately helps but I found that after a good soak, a rinse in super hot water followed IMMEDIATELY by a wd40 spray down to keep a barrier coat for air to stay away, works best. A wire brush was also needed."
4,Very informative,"This book is very informative for those writing about the ER, especially if you want to know what goes on behind the scenes. It is written so that a person with little to no medical knowledge can easily follow and understand and there is even a bit of humor.If you are looking for more specific details on diagnosis or different treatment options for certain ailments, you will need to have an actual medical contact person."
4,I Liked This Episode!,Star Trek: The Next Generation is one of my favorite television shows and The Naked Now may not be the best episode of the series and not a 5 star episode but I still think it was good and I enjoyed watching it and I like that they played homage to the Original Star Trek series episode The Naked Time. It was a nice tie-in to that show! In this episode the crew of the Enterprise is exposed to some kind of highly contageous virus that makes the infected individuals act as though they are drunk. I have this episode on video and I'm hoping to someday buy the complete seasons of Star Trek: The Next Generation on DVD.
3,Sequels from the Original Series,"The third episode, ""The Naked Now"", is the sequel to the Original Series episode, ""The Naked Time."" The story opens with a Federation science vessel, the U.S.S. Tsiolkovsky, studying a star, on the verge of going supernova. During the mission, the crew of the ship is exhibiting strange behavior, until one person of the crew blows a emergency hatch, killing the Tsiolkovsky's entire crew. The U.S.S. Enterprise is ordered to investigate, and finds that most of the crew are frozen, someone has been playing with the environmental controls, letting the heat suck out into space. Not long after, Geordi complains that Sickbay is too hot. It prompts Dr. Crusher to keep Geordi under observation.Slowly, more crewmembers fall prey to the same strange feelings, prior to the Tsiolkovsky crew's deaths."
5,My Favourite Gordon Lightfoot Album,"Gordon Lightfoot does not write bad songs. I'm glad that he is still out there on the road and performing. I'm not Canadian, but I think there is a wonderful expression of the common 'good things' in the North American spirit. We're in a real dip in the road, song writing-wise. It's nice to listen to good songs, good guitar, and a simple voice."
4,Jim,this was a recording I had on 8 track tape and was glad to download it on my phone. Gordon Lightfoot is an amazing guitaress that I just just enjoy listening and he had inspired me to play guitar myself.
5,Great Beginnings for Gord at Warner/Reprise,"Gord's first album for Warner/Reprise is evocative of the artist's period of greatest musical strength, beginning with this album and going through Salute. It starts of with two strong story-tellers, 10 Degrees and Getting Colder and Miguel. It explodes with energy on Redwood Hill and warbles of true love with Cotton Jenny. This whole album brings back memories of those times. Though not through the roof in quite the same way that If You Could Read My Mind and Sundown are, Summer Side of Life is a fun, exhilarating, and most excellent album."
1,"An egocentric, eisegesis interpretation of Revelation","Over the last century the Watchtower Society has released 5 different and contradictory books trying to explain the book of Revelation. In 2006, the Watchtower released through the Kingdom Ministry a list of 70 changes that need to be made to this book. That should indicate to anyone with a serious interest in understanding the book of Revelation that these publications have no credibility.I have to wonder how many Jehovah's Witnesses actually believe the interpretations presented in this book, such as the 7 trumpets of Revelation chapter 8 referring to the Watchtower Societies ""special resolutions ... featured at seven conventions from 1922 to 1928."" It takes an incredible stretch of the imagination to believe John was referring to these irrelevant events, long forgotten even in the minds of Watchtower followers."
4,Fela In His Prime,"Although Nigeria's king of afrobeat never forgot that the strength of his material was the hypnotizing rhythmic groove, his early compositions were more or less African-tinged interpretations of James Brown's funky workouts. By the time ""Upside Down"" was released, Fela had honed his craft such that it still paid homage to Brown, but was far more reflective of Fela's own identity. This is still a fierce collection of afrobeat jams (highlighted by the almost 15 minute long title track), focused on the dancefloor with politically incisive commentary. You've likely heard the hype about Kuti and his legacy (which includes his son Femi and slavish devotees Antibalas). Here's the perfect validation of those claims."
4,Low Profile Backpack,"I'm using this bag while traveling around Kyrgyzstan and it helps me keep a low profile while in town. The bag is suprisingly comfortable and roomy. The canvas does absorb water like a sponge but water proof spray may resolve that. I was looking for a very down to earth, casual backpack and this is exactly what I needed."
5,Stone washed bag,"I really like this bag alot. It isn't made out of thin cheap canvas like one person said it is made out of strong canvas. It is a good size bag and I use it for school and every day errands. It isn't a very large bag, but it isn't too small. I am able to pack a netbook, a textbook, a folder with papers, a notebook, wires for the neckbook, mouse, pens, a sweatshirt and a bottle of water in it, and it still has room. The pockets in front are conveinent and can old alot of things too. It has nice straps, and I like the part where I don't have to undo the buckle all the time to get in and out of the bag. There are two snaps on it and you just pull them off and you can then access the bag that way. My only complaint is that after some use one of the snaps fell apart. I glued it back and so far so good, but I am not sure if it will stay. Other than that the bag is perfect for every use and great for any one at any age!"
4,Backpack,"Nice, heavy weight backpack- perfect for my son (8 yrs old) to carry his books in. I am worried the leather strap that holds the backpack closed won't last long, it kinda weak."
5,"Durable bag, good pockets, not nerdy","I bought this bag for my daughter when she went on a class trip to New York City. It's durable, has great pockets, and doesn't look dorky. I wouldn't use it as a book bag, but for a light carry on, it's terrific."
2,Not the Andy I love,I have Andy's first 2 CDs. The music & sound are KILLER. This CD is a traditional jazz departure that I just cannot get into!
5,ABSOLUTE FURY,This is a wonderfully written book. A great Christmas present!!Make sure you have time to read this book because you won't put it down.
5,Scary Implication of Depopulation,"There are millions of missing women in India and China--girl babies aborted or killed. What are the policy implications for a lopsided surplus of men for a country? ""Bare Branches"" explores this problem. Historically, the problem meant high crime and wars, and, oddly, a dramatic drop in freedom and value for women. An intesting book, should be widely read."
1,What about countries with higher gender ratio?,"According to data from www.geohive.com, the average world gender for 2005 was estimated to 101, and from the same data China (106) and India (105) occupied the 15th and 23rd places respectively. The honor place goes to United Arab Emirates with a ratio of 214.I think they choose the wrong countries to study this phenomenon.""In God We Trust All Others Bring Data."""
5,Reluctant Father,"This is the first book by DP I read many moon's ago. I was hooked. This isthe story of a man, unwanted as a child who grows up a loner. Then a childhe never knew he had comes to him. The only love of his life comes back totown for a visit. Then DP does her magic and love slowly begins."
4,A dream TV comedy show!,".No fake laugh tracks;.Clever writing;.Endless humour;.A lot of location shooting;.Steve Carell at the top of his game;.Great supporting characters;.Coherent character development and plot lines.This is a dream come true: a TV show with comedy, heart and intelligence at the same time. I watched all the episodes in three days, a thing I never did before with any TV show. The 20-22 minutes goes by so fast, so great this show is. Not a single wasted moment. A real gem."
5,"the office - season 3 is the best season ad the funniest,reat laugh!",i had a blast watching the 3rd season of the OFFICE.it's the best season by far and the cast are simply top notch!!!
5,Absolutely hilarious!,I think this is the best series so far. The ending leaves me on tenterhooks for Series 4 to see what will finally happen with Pam & Jim. A lot of the other characters are coming into their own also. The DVD is great value with all the extra features....
4,hilarious,"The office seems to get funnier with every season. This season is super funny. If you've never seen the office, buy the other seasons first, or you won't know what's going on. BUY IT"
1,"amazing show, TERRIBLE PACKAGING!!!!!!!","I love The Office... one of my favorite shows. But it is really disappointing the way these DVD's are packaged. What ever person decided to go with this packaging should be FIRED! I handle my DVD collection with care and yet still both seasons that I have that came with this packaging end up with massive scratches with render them unwatchable. There is little more annoying than getting half way through an episode that you are really into and having it freeze because the DVD is scratched. I realize in the grand scheme of things this is minor but I am not rich and cannot afford to replace these. Luckily I have Netflix so I can get this season on instant viewing but it doesn't have the extra's that I bought the DVD for. My recommendation if you buy these, put them into a DVD book and don't leave them in their original packaging. This goes for Season 2 and 3. I will watch the rest on Netflix."
5,Great DVD Set,If you are an office fan you will love all the extra deleted scenes. I also like that they included some other extras besides commentary.
1,Not MAC Compatible. Not Available in PR USA,"It's not MAC compatible, but I gave it a chance an download it from my PC. After paying for the episode a window popped up saying that Amazon Unibox is not available in Puerto Rico because is non US."
5,We love The Office!,We have all three seasons and we love to watch them over and over and comment on how people at our jobs resemble the characters on The Office. What a great show!!!
4,"Good Season, not the best of all of them though","Season 3 was good. I laughed & had a good time watching it. But I just didn't like this season as much as I loved season 2. Maybe it was Jim being away & dating Karen, pam left alone sad, or everyone merging together (though I'm glad Andy stuck around he's now one of my favorite characters) Still worth buying though!"
5,"Awesome content, no iPod/iPhone support, poor Mac support","5 stars for The Office, 1 star for playback options.There are two critical flaws with Amazon Video On Demand: (1) no support for playback on an iPod or iPhone, and (2) no ability to download to a Mac.If you use a Mac, you must watch it via streaming in your web browser (full screen is supported), which results in sometimes choppy playback. The quality is acceptable but not what you would hope for with purchased content. It seems to be even lower quality than the On Demand Movie/Video player from a certain online movie rental company.As for the content, perfection."
5,The Office Season 3,Wow!! This is such a great show. I just can't wait till the season 4 DVDs come out!w00t! =-D
4,Definitely worth purchasing.,"Starts off slow, but ends up being one of the most satisfying seasons yet. The acting here is tremendous, as is the joke-delivery. More so, they don't make things too over the top as you find in sequals to other seasons. Well done NBC!"
5,Hilarious Show,This was one of my favorite seasons and the bonus content was fun to watch. This DVD has gotten a lot of use.
5,The Best Show On TV,This show is the reason Thursdays feel like a holiday for me. This DVD is a must have for any fan of the show. The bonus features are awesome and watching the romantic passiob between Dwight and Angela is the best! haha... GO SCHRUTE!!!
5,Hilarious!,"I have heard a lot about the office since it first began but was often resistant to watching it because of it's timing, being on a busy Thursday night for me. However, my brother bought me the dvd for Season 1 on Christmas and since then I have purchased Season 2 and 3! Each season is hilarious and definitely different from much of shows out there. I love the mockumentary format, and for those of you who love The Office, definitely watch Waiting for Guffman or Best in Show by Christopher Guest, as they follow a similar format and are fantastic!"
5,the office;season 3,i ordered the office and i received it rather quickly. it's exactly what i ordered and i have enjoyed it tremendously.
5,"""Crazy Characters""",fter just discovering this sit-com I want to see all the episodes. I think the office team makes the show the success it is. I like the on-going Jim and Pam attraction and I think if they don't eventually tie the knot everyone will be disappointed.
3,The Soap Opera Continues...,"In the third season, you see the writers of THE OFFICE slowly start to run out of ideas for humour. Instead, they try to hook you with soap opera. And they do a pretty good job of it.The show is still funny - often enough to make it a watchable comedy - but it becomes less and less so. Unfortunately, the show is sometimes too stupid to be funny."
5,Probably the best season in my opinion.,"I have long time been a fan of The Office and recently lost my copy of season 3. I had to buy it again because in my opinion, this is the best season of the show. With the introduction of the new characters and as always the shenanigans you won't stop laughing."
5,Great Show Great Season,I love the office it is hands down the best comedy on TV right now. If you have never watched the office I highly recommend getting all three seasons and watching them you will wounder why you didn't start sooner.
5,Quality Collection at a Great Price,"The great problem with Rodrigo's canon of compositions is that the finest lesser known works are usually bundled together in collections weighted down with pieces that deserve to remain lesser known. Otherwise, these small gems are doled out with his foremost creations, which are already in most collections, often in several versions.My delight here is that while I bought the 2 CD package for the Concierto Serenade, with its featured harp performance, I also got a handful of other small wonders. And, although I was in a sense coerced into paying for yet another reading of the Concierto de Aranjuez and Fantasia para un Gentilhombre, the extra cost was virtually nil...and these renderings were, in fact, among the premiere interpretations to be found.Overall, this is a wonderful package that I recommend without reservation."
3,"Informative, but biased.","I read this book with interest because I like beer and am a conservative.I found the book to be an interesting historical description of the Coors family and their company.However, the Coors members were conservatives politically (like me), and the author is obviously a liberal, pro-union and anti-Reagan guy.The Coors folks apparently founded the Heritage Foundation with their money. That's ironic, because on TV I see that Heritage recently touted a book describing the Democratic Party as ""a subsidiary of the teachers' unions."
2,Not What I Was Hoping For,"I thought that Citizen Coors is one of the most confusing books that I ever read. There was no structure in the book. The author would touch on several subjects, none which were related to the other, in each chapter. He was always switching topics, before he concluded with the present one. Therefore, it was very hard to get a ""feel"" for how the Coors family operates. Several years ago I read the biograhpy on the Busch Family titled ""Under the Infuluence"" and thought it was an excellent book. I was hoping the Citizen Coors would be as good, but was very disappointed."
3,Drink Coors,"So the Coors are not a family of left-wing loonies. BFD. Other than making the best darn beer in American History, what do you want? Ben and Jerry liberalism? Not here my friend. This author is somewhat balanced, but is clearly to the left of both the Coors and the Real American Public. Coors beer is the best in the land, but, unfortunately that is not enough to put them on top...yet."
1,I wish I could give zero stars!,"Unfortunatly, we have been very disappointed in the chopper. Everything leaks out of it, so we purchased the blender and are now on our second one! The rubber in the bottom has burned out and left black all over my chopper.The customer service is the worst experience of all. They will not stick behind anything they say or quote you. If we could do it over again we would buy a food processor from somewhere else.I bought it for baby food and a good portion of it leaks over the edges! The motor is also starting to sound poor, forget the idea of making sugar into powdered sugar... Even at 3 seconds per pulse the machine overworks and smells like it's burning out the motor."
2,expensive coffee grinder,the first time I used the blender- the rubber seal at the bottom trashed out-black everywhere- $20.00 to replace it from retailernot goodits great for coffee beans-chops up ham for ham saladwished it would chop ice like the commercial saidbut it wont
1,NOT a good product at all.,"Infomercials are so misleading.Pros:- chop items quickly- pretty easy to clean- pretty bulky considering the amount of contents its able to chopCons:- blade will rust, replacement blade is free but everytime you replace it, it's $4.95 shipping charge.- hard to chop everything in the bowl, alot of times big chunks are left untouched,because the blades are about 2 cm above the bowl itself.- chops things quickly, but you still have to chop items considerably to be able to fit it in the ultimate chopper.well theres alot more cons that outweigh the pros. to be put simply, i purchased my quick chopper in august of 2004, used it a few times when i first got it, and havent touched it since. but today i thought i give it another shot, and it will stay in the cabinet collecting dust."
2,Works well but poorly made,"I have an ultimate chopper and I use it for grinding grains to make homemade cereals for our baby. It is the only thing I have that works so well for grinding rice, barley, and oats into powders for cooking. However, a few years ago while using it the lid got stuck on it and I have not been able to remove it. I still use the chopper and rinse it out as necessary. Because I can't remove it I can only use it for dry goods and not wet foods.I love how powerful it is and how great a job it does grinding grains. I gave it two stars because of the lid malfunction."
1,Not Like the Old One!,I received the Ultimate Chopper (GREEN button) as a gift about 5 years ago. It chopped fantastic! I put the plastic top on the top dishwasher rack and it warped. No problem. I decided to purchase a new chopper recently and used if for the first time tonight on onions and peppers. I got MUSH before I got chopped. Back to the old way...this product is NOTHING like it's original version. I don't recommend it!
4,Great product!,"I've had my Ultimate Chopper for about 8 years now and I use it all the time. I actually got a deal on purchasing 2 choppers together and like many, I blew out the motor on my first one, but after I realized what went wrong, I know how to use it and it's the most helpful thing to have in my kitchen now. It's a great time saver, very easy to use, easy to clean, and so small that it doesn't take up much space on my counter top. I don't use the blender though. That doesn't seem to work as well."
3,Canon KC-181F Label Set,"The Ink Label is satisfactory and quality-wise good and can be recommended whoever is interested. While printing much quantity is used, I have sparingly used it."
2,A few things you should know.,"I originally gave these shoes 4 stars, but after wearing them for a few days, I've changed my mind. They're not that great.First, the 'stuff' does not retain heat for very long. These shoes are much better at warming up your feet than they are at keeping them warm.Second, you can't walk with these slippers on, because you will crush the 'stuff'.Third, if you do buy them, make sure you get the right size. If your feet are size 8 or bigger, get a large. If they're too small, you'll heat either your toes or your heel, but not both."
1,Horrible,"Product never came. I had to eventually call Amazon and they claimed that the product was damaged and never set up to ship again. THEY ARE FULL OF CRAP, the product was never shipped!!!"
2,a little disappointed,"Had this for 3 years and used it a few times. Really like the size, the lid, the pan and the rack. But I found 2 key problems when trying to make gravy on the stove top: the bottom is rounded so it does not stay put on my ceramic stove top, and the non-stick coating is coming off after only 1 use. So in my next purchase, I will definitely stay away from non-stick and look for a flat bottom pan."
2,"okay, but not the greatest","I found this book to be okay, I am studying fashion illustration and have problems being able to draw the figures so this helped overall, but some of the figures were a bit too sketchy with too many lines. It was also bit too heavy too carry around to my classes, but that's just a personal thing.."
4,As Advertised,"This product works great. It is easy to cut and fit to your phones screen. I have enough left over to replace it once in a while. And it does stick to the phone screen much better than I thought it would. When I run out of the pieces of film, I'll buy it again."
2,Horrible for the Zune HD,"I bought these today at WalMart, and they are terrible. After cutting with a paper trimmer, they were perfect size. Although after VERY careful and slow application, rolling on just a cm at a time, air bubbles would form. I tried rolling the protector on as slow as possible while rubbing from center out with a microfiber cloth. After application, and only rubbing the protector with microfiber, it was scratched past the point of no return. I cannot imagine what this screen protector would look like after a few days of use.Although this product may protect the screen, after a couple of days use you probably won't be able to see the screen with all the accumulated scratches. The users guide says for best results to replace monthly. After initial application I removed it and threw it away.Waste of money."
5,great product,"This is so easy to use and has saved the screen on my digital camera. Wished I had known about this 3 years ago, my lasst camera screen got so scratched up I could hardly see anything in it. Have used it for my cellphone, and several other items. Doesn't cost much either."
2,not as expected,"use on 2cameras and cell phone. The cutting is fairly straight forward, but the pre-cut edge that is supposed to help with seperating the backing from the protector is not cut well so i've wasted one sheet as it ripped easily while taking off the backing. material not durable at all. Got scratches just by using the squeegy in the package. Lastly, if you had to reposition it, good luck getting the bubbles (hazyness) out. Requires too much effort to get it right. Would not recommand it."
3,Bit Tricky,I have to waste few sheets and then I think I got hand on it. I think hardness of the plastic is bit more so .. difficult to use.
2,Protective film sheets,"Difficult to apply and cannot get all the air bubbles out after application. Much to stiff to fit well on most phones and GPS, and cutting to fit is a mess. At least it will stop most scratches, if looks don't matter."
4,Worked for me but....,"These screen protectors are great as long as you do not use the squeegee-card that comes with it. If you use a plastic card (like a credit card)to smooth it out as you put it on, the screen protector will go on smooth as glass. Have had mine on for about 3 weeks and it still looks good."
4,nice product,This is a nice product. I have a nokia surge and film that is made for it cost so much that I had to look elsewhere. My girlfriend has a pantech crossover and needed a protective film too. So this is where I went. They fit almost everything and do it very nicely. They only drawback is it takes a bit of time to trim them to fit. Great product!!
2,better products out there,"I bought this several months ago because it came more than two to a package, and had a convenient grid for sizing. I have used about half the package. At the same time I tried another brand on a different device to compare the two. There is no real comparison. This one is stiff, which would seem to make is tougher but somehow doesn't. In addition, it's more difficult, not less difficult, to position. I need to replace this one at least twice as often as the other though they receive about the same amount of use. Bottom line is that I won't purchase it again and would not recommend it."
4,Great for kids devices (and grown ups too),"Easy to trim and fit to a variety of applications. We have used it on a DS Lite, DSiXL, PSP, and iPhones. Fairly simple to apply if you have patience and clean your hands and the device before starting. Cost effective solution to screen protection."
2,Spring for a better protector,"These screen protectors come in a 10 pack which you'll need if you don't want air bubbles. Trying to cut these to the right size isn't all that difficult but getting them to lay perfectly is impossible. The ""squeege"" they give you is a piece of cardboard that doesn't really do anything. Just don't waste your time or money on these, there are better options."
3,"Okay, but a lot of glare","I bought these screen protectors to use on my GPS. They are nice and thick so I think it will protect the screen, and there are gridlines so cutting for your screen size is simple enough. They are hard to apply because of air bubbles. My biggest complaint is when the sun shines on my GPS, I can't see the screen at all because of the glare. So if you're thinking about buying these for a GPS you may want to reconsider and look for matte/anti-glare screen protectors."
2,Horrible For LG EnvTouch,"I tried to use this thing for my LG Envtouch, and it was horrible! The protector had scratches, already on the surface, and when I put it on, and I could never get it right! I went through all five slips in less then a minute! So I just gave up on it. Plus, the slider thing they tell you to use to smooth out bubbles, dont use it! It just causes even more and worse scratches on the surface. Overall do not buy this product."
4,Great Product,"The day I ordered these I ordered a 10 pk and they arrived I only got a 5 pk, Yet and still I found the product really good. I've had this product before So I knew how to apply it. Never touch the film side and use small circles when applying it while sliding the back off slowly. I had no problems and no bubbles. I would buy this item again for sure. My Last one lasted 3 yrs. on my Ipod Touch."
1,Easy bubbles and scratching applicator. Buy something else,I got a pack of these and got them cut out for our 2 phones. Looked to be a easy fit. Cleaned up the glass and the first one went in the trash. Never could get out the bubbles and the applicator scratches the protector very easy. One pass with the pasteboard applicator and you have a full path of scratches.I managed to use a microcloth to put the next two protectors on but there is no way to get out all of the bubbles. The edges also will not stick down. These are brand new phones and I cleaned them very well.I would not recommend this cover to anyone. I have purchased many custom covers and never had so much trouble.
1,Don't waster your money!,"These screen protectors aren't worth the time or money! They lift on the edges and you just can't get rid of the bubbles. I've now used 5 of the 10, following the instructions very carefully and cleaning the screen beforehand every time. Not a single one has applied correctly!"
1,Screen protector?,"I'm not so happy with this product after installing it on my device. I'm not sure it will even do a decent job of protecting screens from scratches. Time will tell.The screen protector film scratched VERY easily with the ""squeegee"" that was supplied. And by squeegee, I mean the piece of card stock they supplied with the word ""squeegee"" printed on it.I'm sure there is a better product out there, I would pass on this one."
3,Screen protector,The screen protector is semi useful. I understand that most new phones have scratch proof screens so we don't really need screen protectors.
2,Only buy it as a last resort!!,"I recently bought it for my T-Mobile Tap phone, but it scratches so easily!! Also, the screen protector becomes kind of cloudy so you can't see the screen..."
3,Be careful,"I had a LG Rumor touch, when I bought it. They recommended this and put it on for me. I used the phone for almost a month. The protector was still on, but I can not see very clear through it.BUT BE CAREFUL, it said that it should be replace once a month. This means it will cost a lot and I don't think keep putting on and taking off this thing is good for the screen.I returned the phone with this product. I got a new phone and looking for a more durable screen protector."
5,Good protecters,I have bought these protectors before and they do a really nice job. Nice to have the lines on the protectors so you cut them and make a tight fit. A little tricky the first time putting them on but once you get the hang of it it's easy.
5,Work Great,These are a great addition to my smaller electronics. Where I am at there is plenty of dust and sand that eats up the screens of my Ipod and phone. Their easy to install and cut to fit. Plus their the same quality as the pair you can by at the local shops but instead you get 10 for half the price.
3,"Great, but not for the Leap pad...",This was advertised for the leap pad. Well it would be fine but it doesn't fit. The sheets aren't long enough. I had to cut a 1/2 sliver for the bottom of the screen. So now there is a line across the screen were the two pieces fit together. It will work for now but now I have to buy something else that will fit.
1,Not MAC Software,"What a surprise, although the package says PC & MAC - the box that arrives only says : Windows. I opened it and sure enough the disc is Windows only, not MAC. Be careful"
1,too many script errors,"Nice characterizations and great songs, but bizarre script errors a hassle. Requires installation of excessive third party software."
3,waffen66,hey rat breath you can get this for under 15 bucks and your selling it for 49 bucks were you born stupid or did you have to actually learn how? oh and i am thinking your the result of cousins mating.
1,Returned it.,"I love this style in the larger size suitcase that matched this, but needed a carry on that had wheels, so I ordered this. The gussets on the side only allowed this bag to open about 3"", so it made it difficult to see what was packed in it. I don't necessarily want to have to unpack the whole thing to see what's inside. It also was a little heavy, although it is on wheels so I wouldn't be carrying it, but you do have to lift it to put it in an overhead compartment."
3,Wrong track information!,"I purchased this 2 CD set and was astonished to find that track 3, claimed to be ""Hungarian Rhapsody no. 2"" is actually number 12, and track 4, claimed to be Hungarian Rhapsody no. 4 is actually number 2!"
1,Very disappointed!,"This backgammon board is a substandard product. The only thing listed correctly is the color. The board is NOT made of suede. Suede is a leather product and this is covered with a shoddy velvet. The board is lightweight, and even the box it came in was of a poor quality. This was ordered gift-wrapped so it was unable to be viewed ahead of time. Unfortunately, the first time it was seen was when the birthday gift was unwrapped.I am very disappointed and will never take a company's word for the quality of an item again. The gift wrapping was done so poorly that the item's ribbon was placed so the paper's seam was on the TOP and that was even crooked. Nobody could ever tell me that a person did not see that before it was shipped from Amazon's warehouse. Considering the amount charged for the gift--wrapping, Amazon should be embarrassed to claim the work."
5,Very Nice Set,"This is the best looking backgammon set I've owned to date. It has elegence written all over it. The Suede is high quality and the brass latches and handle pieced accentuate it's beautiful color. I am almost afraid to use it. It is gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous. I am very happy with this purchase. If your looking for high quality affordable backgammon set, look no further. I highly recommend it. It is a must buy and worth every penny."
2,Not worth the money,"These were dot to dots on a book that is so small it's almost impossible to do the puzzles. I thought they would be in an average sized book, but the books are super tiny, like 4"" by 4"", so they obviously are very jam packed together puzzles. The puzzles themselves aren't bad this just was not what I expected."
1,Too damaged to review,"The shipper for these frames failed to deliver once and failed to give notice. I had to email to find out it was damaged in shipping and to request the items be sent again. Then they arrived totally broken and no wonder -- there was no individual wrapping inside of the package. Unimaginable for such a fragile product.I did get a prompt return of my money after the second shipping, but then was required to return the package (at the shipper's expense.)A very disappointing and unsatisfactory experience."
3,frames,I like the look but very difficult to assemble. Have not hung them yet so we shall see how that goes.
1,No substance,"This book attempts to show the horrors of war, but instead shows the very shallow insights of the photographer. Not the greatest photography either. I recommend books by James Nachtwey or some Magnum photographers."
4,Excellent Value - works great with my Canon digital,"I bought this filter for a trip to Scotland. It worked very well with myCanon PowerShot Pro Series S5 IS 8.0MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoomusing theCanon LAH-DC20 Conversion Lens Adapter (LA-DC58E) and Hood (LH-DC40) Set for the S5 IS, S3 IS & S2 IS Digital Camera. I set the Effects setting on my camera to Black & White and used long exposure times (1 to 3 seconds depending on available light). I used a tripod, and the shutter delay (2 seconds) to get crisp images. The LCD screen showed a very accurate representation of how the photos would turn out."
3,Pearl Harbour AND Singapore,"""Battlefield: Pearl Harbor"" does not indicate that more than half of the DVD contents shows the loss of Singapore to the Japanese, in the months following Japan's attack on Pear Harbor. The DVD jacket and label offers no mention of this extensive content.Winston Churchill called the defeat of British forces in Malaya and Singapore, and the sinking of the battleships Rodney and Prince of Wales, ""The greatest disaster in our history"" and ""a grievous and shameful blow to British prestige.""Although painful to watch, both battles are surveyed with adequate detail and strategic analysis.Recommended."
3,Okay,A little slow and the digital copy is not as clear as I was expecting it to be. I guess for a young child it is okay
4,entertaining collection of stories--but still no Pot Stories,"This is Krassner's third collection of drug stories, to go along with his collection of marijuana stories (Pot Stories for the Soul) and LSD stories (Psychedelic Trips for the Mind). This is a good collection of tales about experiences with magic mushrooms, ecstasy, peyote, mescaline, THC, opium, cocaine, ayahuasca, belladonna, ketamine, PCP, STP, ""toad slime,"" and others. The chapters on magic mushrooms and ayahuasca are pretty good-sized collections of interesting stories; many of the others are quite small. There are only a few that have quite the humor value of many of the stories in Pot Stories for the Soul, but I think this volume is a better collection than Psychedelic Trips for the Mind."
5,Clear and Easy to Understand,"I've read several different versions of the Bible. This Bible is done from a different cultural viewpoint so names don't match the Bible that I am accustomed to, but it is very easy to decipher the world and word of the prophets, apostles, and characters in this book. It gives the story from a different viewpoint, but it loses nothing in the translation. It actually makes me think about what I have already known and it clarifies some of the answers to questions I always ask myself when reading a traditional Bible. I highly recommend this book, especially for those who have a non-traditional approach to religion."

5,The Kolbrin Bible,"This is a great reference for those who seek the true path to eternal life.I can see why organized Religion would want to destroy ancient records of mans existence on this earth.You need the Bible, but many things were left out.The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord.The Bible dis tinkly tells you what God is and you must worship God in the spirit.If you seekthe knowledge in the Kolbrin Bible,If you do not trust in God you will never get the true valve of this secret knowledgeYours Truly THor Amundsen 32Degree Mason Rosecrucian"
1,"Come on, people...!","Now, if I've got this right, this is a 3,600 yr.-old Sumerian manuscript plus a 1,900 yr.-old English/ Celtic manuscript that were subsequently transcribed onto bronze scrolls which survived, within a copper-clad box, a 12th-century fire that destroyed the Glastonbury Abbey and then found their way into the hands of the Culdian Trust in New Zealand where the collection was kept in hiding over the past 800 years or so, only to come to light in full-blown modern English now that the ""2012 cataclysm"" is in vogue. It warns of a red comet/Planet X/dwarf-brown twin star to our Sun that is on a 3,600 yr. orbit which will swing it by here within four years, and of the physical and spiiritual preparations (a la New Age) that we must take to prepare ourselves.Hmmmm...Is there something wrong with this picture?"
5,The Kolbrin - A Very Spiritual Book,The Kolbrin - a very spiritual book. Lovingly written centuries ago but relevant for today. Beautifully presented ! Affordable. A must for every home.
5,Hawk's Done got here quick,This is a great book and opens your eyes up to a new perspective. It shipped quickly and it is a good story to analyze and think about.
2,Unrated Version -- 5 Stars!!!,"Rob the Grob is right! I remember seeing the 85 minute unrated version of this when I was younger and it contains BUCKETS more gore than the 80 minute R rated version. The R rated version has so much of the violence and gore eliminated that there is basically no reason to watch it.Like the scene where Bobby Ray stabs Gus the security guard in the eye.... you don't even see the pencil penetrate the eye in the ""R"" version!! This is total B.S. -- Rob was right... If you are going to take the time to release ""Psycho Cop Returns"" on DVD, shouldn't you release the best version available?!?! Fans of this genre want to see the maximum amount of carnage and nudity, not this stripped-down garbage!!!"
2,Wheres the Gore?,"I remember seeing both this and the first part when I was in middle school and I remember a lot more gore. This DVD version of Psycho Cop 2 has all the gore and cheezy but brutal scenes cut out! Every time the Psycho Cop kills they only show the first part but leave out ALL the scenes showing the bodies. If you can, buy the origional cut on VHS and avoid this DVD version, it's not worth it!"
5,Hear the Invisible,"This intensely passionate expression of adoms back to our First Love (who is Spirit) looks at the ""why's"" of the Self-Existor's contemporary love for us. It is an hour of music to share in tears and euphoria with your own Maker, and Bridegroom. We all have a cross to bear, that we cannot bear to bear, but for Him, it really must have been a cross of love. The fact that a Spirit as large as the universe would breath Their own breath into us clay formations, lose us, and want us back enough to become One of us and buy us back with His own blood, is heart flight. But without doing this, we could not understand how to hear and live to be for Him [Them] in perpetual gratitude and marvel."
5,God's passion moved me to tears again and again,"I love this whole work, and how it melds contemporary feeling with classical form; but, from the time I first heard In the Beginning performed at a dinner theatre at Second Baptist Church in Houston, I knew I had to have this song. The pure and exhilarating passion between God and Adam -- before sin and the need for salvation ever entered the picture -- spoke God's powerful desire for intimate relationship with me like nothing I have ever heard. I am sure that for at least the first thirty times I listened to that song I wept through most of the song and wanted to shout for joy at the same time. God used it to minister His love to my heart like very few songs I have ever heard, in my 58 years of life."
5,Not A Typical Video Game,"I bought this for my son because he had played it while at school & he really liked it. I like it because it is not shoot 'em up like most video games but instead you have to really think to get through to the end alive! On our version there is no fishing which my son does miss but still enjoys the game. Also, the game does not fill our entire monitor but you can still see it fine."
1,dont buy this item !,"i gave a one star because there isn't a lesser rating than it.i have windows 2000 professional. USB 1.1it simply doesnt work well. i lost valuable data while copying.well, it says the installation is easy, direct plug and play, but whats the use if there is no use after that ?pls dont buy this !"
2,Too SMALL for three people...,"I purchased this boat for my trip on the Au Sable River. My very first time on the river, and there was only TWO of us in the boat. Even with just two people and a small (tiny) cooler (for few drinks and sandwiches), we felt CRAMED IN it. There was no room for our legs (they just hang out of the boat for 5 hours during our river trip). The divider in the middle of the boat was kinda nice, because I sat in the front and leaned my back on it, while my friend sat in the back, not knowing where to put his legs, because there was no room for them. It was kinda a funny, yet uncomfortable situation. I strongly suggest buying a BIGGER boat (maybe a 4-person) for two people. I don't know how the manufacturer figured they can cram 3 people in that tiny thing (even though it looked juge on the picture)."
1,A fine switch,"Just don't get it wet. I also like how it sometimes resets itself to center off if you put a boot on it. Surely nobody would put a boot on a marine switch or risk it getting wet, though.If it does get waterlogged it will internally short at around 10k ohms. LED lamps will glow with the switch off once the switch has been swamped."
2,$120 for a toggle switch,For $120.00 I'm hoping that when I flip this toggle switch it will begin to bend time and space so that I can sail my boat into the future or the past. Which ever I prefer. I really hope this price is a typo. Maybe the seller can enlighten me on why a toggle switch would cost that much.
2,"Thorough, but biased.","The author is to be admired for scope of the undertaking, but must be faulted for a tendency -- unmistakeable and all permeating -- to judge papal history against his own eclectic understanding of Vatican II. As a result, the work seemed more of an argument for a decentralized Church than it did a historical review of the Papacy. I would not recommend this book to those looking for a dispassionate history of the Papacy or of the Church. It is too political to be considered good history."
1,Papal follies,"This is a caricature of papal history, clearly tilted to fit the author's stange view that Vatican II overturned the traditional Catholic view of papal authority. It's breezy enough, but the ideological distortion is so grave and so tiresome that many of the popes are simply not recognizable.For an excellent study of the papacy, read Patrick Madrid's wonderful new book on the subject."
3,so so,"Good on an emotional level - author helps you understand what it really means to have an allergic child, and gives you the psychological and practical tools to deal with it. Recipes however not that interesting (very few) and author does insist on telling you how it would taste better with 'real butter'! which I found frustrating."
5,Excellent Resource!!,"This book has been really helpful to us - our son has some pretty severe food allergies at only 11 months old, and we really have to read labels on EVERYTHING. This book gives you the other words for common food items often found on the nutritional label. It also offers recipes for those who need to substitute impotant ingredients, like milk and eggs, - so no one misses out. Highly reccomended!!"
5,Great information!,"This book has been so helpful! It gives lots of great information about food, but also eatting out, the pharmacy, and other places that you might not think about food allergies being a problem! I have refered to this book many times for help!"
5,Buy this book!,"An excellent compendium of information for someone with a child newly diagnosed with food allergies. Very comprehensive, and made me aware and think about things that had never occurred to me.It helped me to feel that I was not alone in this fear."
2,I found this book to be a disappoint chapter in the Leage series,"In the previous books (Expendable, Ascending, etc) I found Festina to be smart, couragous and likeable. In this book, what are her accomplishments?1) She breaks the legs of a partner she distrusts when the partner comes to ask for Festina's help in rescuing another explorer. Festina does this without asking one question about why she is there.2) Festina unplugs a machine.I was undershelmed. Oh yea, she also fought a dinosaur well. This is not the Festina I miss from the other books. I also found the main character to be a bit on the ""feel sorry for myself"" side."
4,Good but weird chocolate taste,Overall good but the chocolate glaze tastes like dried cocoa. Not exactly the chocolate you may be expecting??
4,A great mix of fun and laugh out loud lyrics,"P.P. King (The American Pharaoh)P-spot's third release in 2006 is a mix of many different genres. They all seem to have the theme of fun and comedic revelry. It starts slow with a folk style, ""Feel like a King."" ""Vicodin"" is one of his best and well known at his live shows. When I am feeling country I listen to ""wild Wild Women"" and laugh. Another pee in your pants melody is in ""I can't hold it"" and the vocals on this mix well. Overall it is music that will make you laugh and catchy lyrics that you will be singing all day.P-spot is the best when you see him live in concert. If you get a chance to see him live do it...you'll pee your pants from his crazy antics and showmanship."
2,Not as pictured,"The picture is not for a take a long, it's for a regular wooden one. The price listed is more expensive than a take along, its more of a typical price for a wooden train. This is a deceptive practice of misleading advertising."
5,gorgeous beautiful coloring..yay,i love this now ill have something to cuddle up with at nite to keep me warm..the color is beautiful and its warm..i love it
3,QUEEN SOLID PURPLE FLEECE BLANKET,"NICE COLOR WELL MADE AND FEELS LIKE A WARM SOFT AND GOOD COLOR BUT AMAZON SHOWS SIZE TO BE QUEEN SIZE OF 86""X94"" --NOT SO- MEASURED MYSELF AND SIZE OF BLANKET IS 78""X94"" --I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR ITS FULL NEW QUEEN SIZE--IF AMAZON DOES NOT RESOLVE THE ADVERTISED BLANKET SIZE I WILL RETURN THIS FOR CREDIT"
2,I'm perplexed and annoyed,"The color of the blanket is beautiful. It's cozy and warm. But the edging is a cheesy knit fabric that is completely a different color. But what's really annoying is that the bag it was in says that it's machine washable and dryable, but the blanket itself says and I quote:""Hand wash in water or warm waterAfter drain for 3 or 4 hours in slight dry under sunlightDo not use bleaching stuffDo not use tumble dryer""So what do I believe?"
2,queen?,"beautiful, soft, blanket but doesn't fit a queen size bed good and it doesn't come in king--thats a shame cause i really liked it but wayyyyy to small"
3,nice for price,this blanket is very soft yet not thick at all. it feels very nice yet is one-ply and not thick.
3,Love the color,Not what I expected and it was not that soft didn't like the border around the blanket but it did keep me warm
5,A Big Help,"Frame's book proved profoundly helpful to me as I had to make the last medical decisions for both of my parents. Uncertainty and guilt can overwhelm decision makers because they don't have time to think things through and because they have not prepared in advance. This book will help overcome, at least, in the preparation. Thank you John Frame."
2,Disappointed,I purchased this cheese slicer as a replacement for a similar one that had simply worn out. I am very disappointed with the performance. I should have purchased a board with a wire cutter - the blade is too heavy on this one. I cannot get a clean cut without mashing any of the cheeses we have attempted to slice.Swissmar Bamboo Board w/Cheese Slicer BladeBamboo Cheese Board with Slicer by Swissmar.
3,Blimp,"This blimp worked very well, but was too expensive. Its basically a balloon with a plastic gondola and a cheap remote."
2,Doesn't work at high altitude/in desert,"We had problems with this toy after 1 day. If it is not completely filled with helium it doesn't have enough buoyancy to raise itself up. This may be due to the fact that we live at 4200 feet and in the desert (20% humidity). But since we aren't going to go to the store every day to refill it, it's not very practical. We actually bought 2 of these because on the first day, the front and back doors happened to be opened simultaneously, and a gush of air pushed it right out the back door and it floated away too quickly to retrieve it."
4,Liked this blimp,"Liked this blimp a lot. I bought this for my nephew and he really liked this blimp. He was not able to blow it up, because he was just visiting me at my home on Christmas. There was nothing in the box to blow it up with either. I thought there would have been something to blow it up with. Overall he still liked it. He was so surprised. I am so glad amazon carries everything. Because he actually asked for this for Christmas."
4,WARREN THE GREAT,"Though these films are basically minor entertainment, they do represent some early and sadly rare star turns by this actor, who was cursed with a classically handsome profile -that looked just like John Barrymore! Alas , these films are fine if you like the actor. His work as the Lone Wolf, Philo Vance, and Perry Mason - yes, the original!!! outshine this stuff, but - if you are interested in this actor, whose star suddenly faded after the war, and who then died tragically early from consumption, pick this up!!"
1,Outdated and Expensive,"Although when first published Inciardi's collection was a valuable addition to the drug policy debate literature, today the articles here are outdated and with little current relevance. For the price, therefore, this book is a big rip-off, and I would advise finding it in the library if you want to use it for historical research."
2,I read it for my university english class,I read this for my university class and wrote a paper on it. I found It kind of confusing. The switch from reality to his iminagination
3,A read worth the reading.,"Accept no warnings from dissatisfied customers without checking the merchandise yourself. I read this when it came out, years ago (my background, editor in the physical science field; baseball lover) and found it a marvelous sad take on fantasy fixations; the dread thing that was programmed to happen, possibly, does happens--and things then fall apart for real; enough said). We needn't like everything, that's certain, but people who warn you that something is not worth reading or hearing or seeing, based on their own dumb reactions, are not playing the game right."
4,A Fantastic CD.,"the CD does not look like much, but it is collection of amazing works. full of up beat songs that make you want to dance, poems being spoken with feeling and bring to light current social issues, and finally spoken words of truth and inspiration. created by the youth of Los Angeles through shakespeare festival/la."
2,Disappointing and inferior to Rough Guide,"I usually get both the Lonely Planet and Rough Guides for my trips, and generally both are good. In this case there is no comparison, and I would recommend just getting the Rough Guide. It's 585 pages compared to Lonely Planet's slim 332 and contains much more detailed information. The fourth edition of the Rough Guide (May 2003) is even less expensive! And where Lonely Planet usually wins, in color photographs and maps, the Rough Guide has at least caught up. I do like Lonely Planet's giving phone code and population for each city/town/village, but that alone doesn't make it worth carrying around!"
2,All Good Things Must End,"All good things must come to an end, and ""Endless Wire"" marked the conclusion of the most successful period of Gordon Lightfoot's career as a recording artist. There is a dreariness throughout this album that is partly the result of the murky, echoey arrangements, but mostly the result of weak material. The remake of ""The Circle Small"" suggests that Lightfoot was in a songwriting drought, especially considering that this new version, when compared to the original, has nothing new to offer emotionally. The title track, despite being the best song on the album, conveys an almost unbearable feeling of paranoia, while songs like ""Daylight Katy"" and ""Sweet Guinevere"" merely sound flat. I suggest avoiding ""Endless Wire"" unless you already own all of Lightfoot's earlier albums and are in desperate need of something different."
4,Gordon Has A Warm Sounding Country/Folk Voice.,"Gordon is a hero in Canada and one of their best ever exports.Endless Wire is from 1978 with 10 tracks, all with top class production, in my opinon the excellent songs are Daylight Katy, Endless Wire and the very sad The Circle Is Small.Thanks Gordon !"
2,Don't start with this one,"I really like Teaze's previous (third) album ""One night stands"" which I discovered by pure luck. But this fourth album doesn't have a single good song, as I remember it. Pretty dull, unimaginitive hardrock. I actually gave it away to a charity secondhand shop after a few listens. If you absolutely love this type of music then you might still enjoy this. But if you (like me) listen mainly to other types of music and only sometimes to hardrock, then this is not a record to buy. At least, start with some other Teaze album."
1,Not A Proper Dictionary,"I am currently learning and teaching my nephew the trivium...grammar, logic and rhetoric. This ""dictionary"" does NOT EVEN contain the word rhetoric! Get a proper book...Don't waste your time or money on this waste of paper."
5,Rotary Rocks,"I bought these so they could be given to 3rd graders at an elementary school for emotionally troubled children. For many it was the first book they have ever been able to call their own. Modesto East Rotary is the best mer1987.org. Great job kids, keep up the good work in school."
5,perfect condition,"Although I saw the product cheaper this school season in my local drug store, it was still a good deal including shipping."
1,Do not recommend strongly,"I have been using this B&D Rick Cooker from past several months. Everytime I cook rice the starch flows out from the cooker spoiling the cooking platform. I tried several ratios of Raw Rice to Water but of no use. Now, I really regret why I did not return back. Now, I'm shopping around for another rice cooker."
1,Very bad Rice Cooker,This rice cooker is the worst buy I have ever made. My wife bought on and it worked great for three days then it just stopped working one day. I returned it and got a new one thinking that it was just the one we bought. Brought it home and again it worked great for thre days and then it just stopped. This is truly the worst buy ever.
5,perfect rice,great just great i love rice with dinner now i can have perfect rice each night. no standing and watching. great workmanship looks good in the kitchen.
5,Dixieland The Way It Was MEANT To Be Played!,"Dixieland Jazz is supposed to be upbeat straight forward music. This CD is all of that and more. Each musician is master of his craft. It seems in recent years that musicians, like many chefs, seem to think that they have to ""add a little something extra"" to the recipie. What happens is they lose the essence of what the piece is supposed to be. A great musician brings his own style to each piece, but he or she knows that more is not necessarily better. That is where the South Frisco Jazz Band shines. They play with energy and style, true to the music they obviously love. If you like traditional jazz, you have to have this CD. ENJOY!"
1,Waste of a lot of money,"I bought this software for my 2 year old and while it helps him gain control of the mouse and the idea of working with the computer, $30 is way, way, way overpriced!For the price of a modern game they offer 80s style graphics on a handful of short games that are even too boring for a 2yr old and it teaches nothing new.I'm positive that the various (...)children software out there do the exact same thing as this does."
2,disappointing,"Kaminer gets the bad guys right, and she has interesting points to make about them, but her own biases show through and her arguments are seldom as complete as she believes.Her argument about the war on drugs illustrates the lack of depth of many of her points: noting that 21% of violent felons committed their crimes under the influence of alcohol, 3% on cocaine and only 1% on heroin she concludes that alcohol is associated with much more violent crime than are illegal drugs. But Kaminer's facts are irrelevant to her argument: what we need to know are the conditional probabilities of commiting violent crime while high on these three drugs (for all the evidence Kaminer cites, it could be that .001% of alcohol abusing events lead to violent crime vs 10% for cocaine and 50% for heroin, figures that would contradict her argument).This kind of superficial argument arises in several places and reduces the value of what could have been a much more interesting book."
1,Unoriginal with little substance,"The books promises to be an examination of irrationalism in modern pop culture, but the book's subtitle, ""The Perils of Piety,"" give away its real agenda - attacking major religions. The jacket blurb says Kaminer boldly attacks popular notions...It's hardly bold to attack Christianity. Kaminer does it far less persuasively than any other writer I've read....With barely a statistic or study referenced in the entire book, she tries to battle humankind's largest and most enduring belief systems. It's an easy guess which side wins."
1,extremely one-sided,"I heard an interview with this author on the radio, so I sampled her book. I am very disappointed. I thought she would at least present both sides of the picture, but I found her to be very judgemental: in fact she smacks of one who is angry with unconventional experiences because she herself is wrestling with one...not unlike a gay-basher who is secretly gay. I am not saying she doesn't have a few points, however the book would have been more effective had she shown the tiniest interest in not making her subject matter appear not only foolish, but degrading. Bottom line: the world of ""irrationality"" may be silly to her, but her world of ""imperical reality"" seems awfully boring to me."
1,"Angry, unresearched slop",This author simply rants and raves about everyone she dislikes - which is just about everybody to the right of a Unitarian or Gay Studies professor. There is no serious statics or social research in this book. A sloppy effort by a marginal writer published by a marginal company.
1,How does this woman face herself in the morning?,"What one corporate reviewer calls a ""thorough analysis"" is just a wad of poorly-written venom spit by an unimportant, unexceptional thinker; as irrational and incredulous as the movements she attacks.There are no facts in this book, just the author's rants. Everyone from eastern spiritualists to evangelical christians are savaged by an ignorant, spiteful writer. A terrible work that should never have been published for its lack of intellectual merit alone. It's destined to add to the degradation and polization of public discourse in American life. This book shows that intolerance and bigotry are alive in well in America today."

1,Returned it 5 minutes after I began reading it,"Someone gave this to me as a gift for reasons unknown to me. After reading the first 2 pages, it went right back to store where it came from. BORING! (By the way, gave it 1 star b/c I couldn't give it none)"
4,Rationalism still lives,"Kaminer takes on the many headed aspects of irrationalism that are so popular recently. She spares neither the right nor the left, i.e. she criticizes the religious right and the growing new age movement. I paticularly like that she stated that while it is fashionable to ridicule the new age as being irrational, it is taboo to do this to any mainstream religion, no matter how far-fetched its tenets may be. I liked that because that is a very rare thing to do, in fact, it may even be unique to Kaminer as far as I know."
2,Divisive?,"There is some interesting commentary in these pages. The book may have been more relevant during the Bush administration, but then again maybe not given the state of political and religious dialogue in the United States today."
4,Recommended,"I found the book very informative. I didn't know much about home improvement or being a handyman when we bought an older home about six months ago. I mean, I had hardly done anything more than tighten the odd loose screw and certainly had never used a power tool. The numerous pictures in the book were exactly what I needed and I found its humorous style appealing. I recently wired a telephone extension to another bedroom in my house following the instructions, and the phone worked immediately I plugged it in. This book hasn't turned me into an expert, but I don't think that is the audience this book addresses. If you already have some technical knowledge and are looking for in-depth stuff, skip this one. However if like me you're a complete novice with an older home and looking for some basic information then get this book."
3,OK for Starters,"Ok for starters, not a ton of detail. Gives short descriptions of how to do basic things but doesn't do a great job going in to specific detail.Also, most of the pictures are of exposed pieces of homes (i.e. walls, celings, etc. There aren't really a lot of pictures of exisiting rooms and closed calls)."
3,"Basics, and that's it.","This book is a little disappointing. It talks about the very, very basics on how to do a project. Coming from the ""experts"" at Home Depot, I expected a little more."
2,Poor advice to the unknowing,"As a professional writer as well as a professional contractor,don't buy these books. They are not written by contractors butwriters with little or no ""real world construction experience.The books are actually published by the Meredith Corporation(Better Homes and Gardens) instead of Home Depot. They simplyslap a Home Depot cover on them.The articles are always incomplete and sometimes dangerous.I have complained bitterly to the Home Depot management andthey don't care.I find this to be true with virtually all the how to booksin the marketplace. They are written by writers and soldto editors who don't care about real information but onlycare about pics and prose on a deadline.John Wilder is an award winning contractor and writerwith numerous articles published in construction andconsumer issues on DIY issues"
2,it is not a brand new book as claimed.,it may be a display book in a store because the book cover has a lot of scratches. maybe it is my first not very happy shopping experience in Amazon.
1,You won't like this,"Yo, this album is not good at all. Some bands are forgotten for a reason. Minimal production and every song sounds the same, which is crummy. The only redeeming value is the liner notes, which made me laugh. I wanted badly to like a rock band from my home state of Maryland, but this sure as heck ain't it. Avoid."
2,Poor Quality,"This is a great idea, but the game itself is very poor quality. Board is warped, pieces are awful, etc. I would not recommend this item."
4,Frommer's TUscany & Umbria 2-nd addition,I found this book practical and usefull from the beginning - We havn't gone yet but the car rental information alone saved us $100 on a 4 day rental. It's a little heavy compaired to our other book but it looks like it covers Tuscany and Umbria thoroughly.
4,"Beautiful pictures, but too long for preschool","This is a wonderfully illustrated book, with lots ofinteresting information. Just make sure your child has a longattention span if you intend to read it all at once!"
1,"Wow, is this bad!","Having purchased almost every Hoyle product out there, I have to say this one is a major disapointment! It's awkward, baddly planned, and honestly, a MAJOR step back in the Hoyle Casino series. I had such high expectations for this game, and with it being months late from the ""release date"" I thought they would of worked out the bugs and the game play.. I was wrong. It's sad, I throughly liked this series, but will think twice before purchasing another title in this series. If you have the 2003/2004 version of Hoyle Casino, stick with it. This will be a major dissapointment!"
1,Zero Stars,"Graphics are cool, but that's about it. Tons of usability issues with betting in BlackJack. Texas Hold'em; can't customize much at all. This software isn't worth the bits used.Skip it."
1,HOYLE CASINO 3D,"SEEING THAT I NEVER GOT THE GAME TO WORK IN MY COMPUTER. I WAITED AND WAITED FOR THIS ""NEW"" VERSION 3D TO COME OUT, THEN TO FIND OUT THAT IT DOESN'T WORK IN MY COMPUTER. EVEN THOUGH MY COMPUTER IS A BRAND NEW TOP OF THE LINE DELL. I TRIED TWO OF THEM ON MY COMPUTER NEITHER ONE WORKED. THANK GOODNESS AMAZON WAS KIND ENOUGH TO REFUND ME MY MONEY EVEN AFTER THE SECOND ATTEMPT TO LOAD THIS GAME. BUT FROM WHAT I AM READING ABOUT IT, I AM PROBABLY BETTER OFF THAT IT DIDN'T WORK!"
1,ENCORE GARBAGE AFTER SIERRA QUALITY,A mess to try to install. Tried on 2 different computers. Encore help needs reprogramming whole computer!! Back to Hoyle Casino 2004- the greatest!!
3,On the strength of one poem ...,"I've just read one poem from this book, ""Glenfillan Sheepdog Trials"", which was featured on the Poetry Daily website <<www.poems.com/today.htm>>. On the strength of that one poem I'd guess this to be a book to read and re-read. The poem describes a dog at work, in such terms that the assertion towards the end that ""a beauty/without vanity shimmers unaware/of itself over the rough field"" has been completely justified."
5,Amazing Filter!,I was very impressed. At first I was skeptical about it but after I used it I was amazed.
5,A somewhat humorous book that would make Finns proud.,"This book, although somewhat dated, gives a perspective of Finland in an entertaining fashion in regards to Finland's history. I would reccomend this title to any person of Finnish lineage... Learn of our shared trait: SISU!"
3,Interesting Story Bogged Down by Superfluous Details,"Not a bad book--and certainly the material's exciting. The best past was at the beginning, when both men were working the field every year. My main problem was the weight the author gave to different parts of the story. For example, he states almost casually that it was Marsh who made the ""biggest palentological error in history"" by putting the wrong head on the Brontosaurus, causing the Apatosaurus/Brontosaurus confusion, but never gets back to who figured out the error. He gives a disporportionate amount of weight to parts of the story that just weren't as important, such as Cope's financial problems and the silver mines. Also-I do have a sneaking admiration for Marsh--he may not have been writing touching letter to his daughter, as Cope did, but he did much more to promote fair treatment of the Indians, etc. As I said, not bad, but still not the definitive book."
4,A good anecdotal history of 19th century science,"Major characters--I think of Agassiz and Lyell--come to play in this story of the collection of fossils (primarily in America) that contributed to the emerging science of evolution. The competition between Cope and Marsh, of course, is the major story and serves as a good vehicle for the larger story of the struggles of scientists to find the truth."
3,Disappointing,"My paleontology professor (a great raconteur) used to tell Cope/Marsh stories - which is why I bought this book in the first place (and a geeky love of fossils). <sigh> Uncle... I give up. The thought of reading any more of this was making me grind my teeth.A juicy story about scientific backstabbing, skullduggery, theft, slander, and venomous, snarky epistles ... is surprisingly boring in Jaffe's hands. The narrative quickly becomes bogged down in all the socio-economic and political background. The cast of famous characters is legion (I ordered a book about P.T. Barnum), but it only serves to further cloud the meat of the story. I'm going to tryThe Bonehunters' Revenge: Dinosaurs and Fate in the Gilded Age."
3,somewhere inbetween,"i have enjoyed Julian Cope's old band The Teardrop Explodes as well as his great solo cd's. but Autogeddon is one album that has yet to pull me in. i'm not sure what it is. perhaps it's just that Peggy Suicide & Jehovakill are such superb and realized albums (and 20 Mothers is pretty great, too) that in comparison, Autogeddon just falls flat. there are some good songs on here. but they seem a bit lost within the context of this muddled album."
4,Diary entries showing the aristocratic source of the USA not without empathy.,"An interesting autobiographical book by Mr. Quincy, a member of the upper class in the USA between 1772-1864 who at least was not racist."
5,wonderful british mystery,"I first read this book when I was 11 years old. We had a copy that my mother had ""pilfered"" from the local library. It was wonderful. I always kept it with me through many moves. I loaned it out once to a ""friend"" who never returned it. I finally contacted a seller in NY that promised to find out of print books. He did and I sent off a check for $25.00. It arrived with the same red cover and was just as captivating as the first time I read it. I lent it to my mother, my sister and nobody else. I love this book, if you get the chance to read it today please do.jennifer b gallagher"
1,Out of date material,This material is way out of date. Don't bother to buy it if you can get something else more up-to-date.
1,Lots of Trouble...indeed,"I have a 10 year old (turning 11 in a couple of months) and I watch lots of kids movies. I have a very high tolerance for silliness and bad plots (not to mention bad acting). Since my son loves animals, I thought he would like this one. However0, that was not the case. This movie just took me over the edge. It is absolutely pathetic. The plot is ridiculous and the acting is miserable. Even my son at one point made the comment ""Daddy, is this a real movie? They don't act very well, do they???"". Anyway, enough said. Stay away from it...save your $$$ and buy something else instead."
2,Sensational 6-Pointed Star Qulits by Sara Nephew,"While this book specializes in an area of quilting that I have an interest in and explains it clearly, it is a slim volume (56 pages) and ..., I found it overpriced."
2,THIS BOOK IS INCOMPLETE - - - LACKING !,"Many beautiful quilts to be made in this book, but lacking good instructions, no explanatory pictures, no templates, no step by step as to how to put the blocks together, a disappointment."
3,essential,"The Lonely Planet is a necessary evil but this edition is becoming cripplingly outdated. I understand a new version is out in January, but it's best to be aware that prices have very much quadrupled at least (due to heavy inflation).As usual, the history sections and background are excellent, though it's worth reading up on the failed Green Revolution in 2009, which is obviously not included."
4,Lonely Planet Iran,Great to refresh my memory of a visit some 35 years ago in preparation for a re-visit later this year
2,Disappointing,"After reading the positive reviews on this devotional guide, I looked forward to using it this past Lent. While some thoughts and stories were illuminating, by and large I found the book disappointing. In places, the author goes on at some length over subjects that are only marginally to the point. Some of the concepts were simply hokey, some were downright tasteless, and I didn't really find any deep wisdom to counter-balance them. I wouldn't say I found the book spiritually off-base. I just found it kind of insipid and not really the kind of guide that makes for a spiritually rich Lent."
3,"The Lenten Labyrinth, Daily Reflections for the Journey of Lent","The reflections in the book are not bad in and of themselves. They are not great either but what I disliked about the book was his misconception of the labyrinth. He equates the labyrinth to a maze. Quoting Mr. Hays, ""the journey to God today is not some long linear path, but more like a complicated labyrinth."" A labyrinth is a simple, one step at a time, path to the center. One never has to make a choice but just continue on the path, a maze has many entrances, dead-end and one must make many choices along it's path to reach the center. If one can overlook the discrepancies of references to the labyrinth, it is not a bad read and has some good thoughts to comtemplate while journeying on a labyrinth."
4,George and me,"George and I go way back. . . in my heart/mind, anyway! This is a lovely collection by a master. I will never have too much Shearing music."
4,Really great,This is a beautiful light jazz collection and so great to listen do with a warm beverage on December evenings as Christmas approaches. It's like powdered sugar on a holiday dessert--light and airy and just sweet enough to make a difference.
4,Mellow and Musical,Those of us who admire Shearing enjoy this unpretentious collection of holiday greats. The 'take five' merry gentlemen is a delight. Take the pressure and commercialism off for just a bit and enjoy some highly musical moments.
2,Slightly Sour,It seems off key in many places. Not what one wants in Christmasmusic. Not one of Shearing's better recordings in my opinion.
1,"Hard to read, very theoretical, too general","I found this book tough to plow through. Straight from the ""ivory tower"", it belongs in a college classroom, not in the real business world. It is quite general, so perhaps it is helpful in some segments of business. I found it hard to relate to my world of commercial software development."
1,"Outdated Forms, and 2 copies of 5 pages total!","This ""kit"" contains: Two (2) copies of a three page rental agreement that is outdated, still has imprinted 19__ for the date. Two (2) copies of a one page condition report, also similarly outdated. Two (2) copies of a one page information sheet. ...I would have rated this Zero (0) Stars if that option had been available."
4,Lotsa Goodies,"You pays your money and you takes your pick. Some folks drool over the short(er), funky tracks from Fat Albert Rotunda - good ensemble work. Others hail by Mwandishi, Herbie Hancock's first foray into ""African"" jazz. I must admit prefering the items from Crossings. I'm not a big fan of long songs, but the 25 minute track ""Sleeping Giant"" (that's those Part One, Part Two things you see on the track listing) is among my favorite tracks to ""chill"" to. Quite a listen, but enjoyable."
4,Feel the Beat,"This album is more engaging than anything Miles Davis had done at this point in the 70s, plus Herbie's band was more interested in testing the sweaty aspects of funk on the Fat Albert Rotunda than its otherworldliness. I am saying that this is music that could've connected with people because the rhythm was so funky and Afrocentric. The rest of this 2 disc set features ambient explorations which are important too but not as memorable as the Fat Albert stuff, though some of the textures like the ones on Sleeping Giant are very inspirational. Trumpeter Eddie Henderson and bass legend Buster Williams perform marvelously among stellar bandmates. Top shelf stuff."
5,MWANDISHI complete recordings,"This music sounds so modern. It's amazing it was recorded 40 years ago.A great phase of jazz that, though it never was as popular as Hancock's other mega successfulventures, still looms large in the history of the evolution of jazz and it's merger withelectronics.five stars!!!! highly recommended"
2,I like Hockney but not this book,"well my review title says it all (although Amazon won't let me stop there).I do like Hockney in general even though he is a much more cerebral artist than I prefer.I did not read the story behind each painting/drawing because that's not what I'm interested in. But if one must read about a painting to enjoy it then somethings missing.The only work I really enjoyed was #100 of his mum. The drawings seemed much stronger than the paintings (to me) and some I've liked in the past seemed missing from this book (or maybe I'm imagining that).I know it's not my place to tell Mr. Hockney to let go and get a little emotional but that's what I feel looking at the portraits. Restrained, inhibited, arms length, surface not depth."
5,Illustrator Speaks:,"Hello, I am Matt Faulkner, the illustrator of the book pictured above. The reviews attached to this book are for a version of Jack and the Beanstalk illustrated by Steven Kellogg. I hope you get a chance to check out the Jack and the Beanstalk which I illustrated. It has sold over 600k books since its publication in 1985.Thank you,Matt Faulkner"
5,Great product,"This product keeps my 30GB iPod video from getting scratched or scuffed. Although it's not the prettiest case, it's still great because it's very durable and reliable."
3,"Covers very well, one major flaw","Covers all of the ipod except for the clicking wheel. This was one of the few cases I could find that would cover the screen of the ipod for this cheap of a price. Can access earphone input and the lock switch easily. The major flaw is accessing the USB/dock port. It is near impossible to unplug the cord from the ipod because of the design of the case. You will almost have to open the case back up to unplug your ipod. The case itself is very hard to open, which is good in one case since it will preven the ipod from falling out, but since you almost have to open it to unplug your cord, it's too much of a hassel. This would be a good temporary case, but not recommended for long-term use."
5,The best baby spoons ever,"These are the best baby spoons I have come across. I received a small pack of them for a baby shower and they are better than the nice stainless spoons I got. They hold a bigger bite than the classic plastic covered spoon and the shape allows the baby to get all the food off the spoon. They are tossable, but I cannot toss them. They are too great to do that to. This pack has 24 for $3.95. A steal. I am tempted to by several to put up and give as gifts. These are a must have for meal time!P.S. At first I was hesitant to use these spoons because I wanted my son to have the best of the best - the expensive engraved spoons. Then my babysitter kept using them and raved about them. So I finally tried them and to my surprise, they were the best of the best."
4,Good little thesaurus,"It has many of the words a 4th grader needs. However, it is somewhat limited on the words though. It's more like an extremely abridged thesaurus rather than a student's thesaurus."
5,Hundreds of hours of fun!,"This is a well-made puzzle. It's huge and so of course some of the pieces are going to seem to fit in several places, but if you're careful and look closely then it's not too tough to tell where a piece is supposed to go."
5,Whopping big puzzle,"This was a gift to my wife, who is an avid jig saw puzzle fan. I also bought a 60"" x 72"" piece of felt from a local fabric store. Good thing. This puzzle is big. It will take her a while, and has proven to be a welcome challenge. I'm glad we have a table big enough to hold it. The image quality is excellent, and the puzzle pieces are very nice quality. There will be more Ravensburger puzzles in our future."
5,Humanity is on the lowest rung of the ladder,"It is confirmed every day and this book is just one more example, that overall, the human race, if viewed from the outside by other more advanced civilizations is at the lowest rung of the ladder. If I were exploring the universe I wouldn't even bother to stop on this third plant from a minor sun; schedule a return visit several thousand years from ""now"" and see if they are still here or have destroyed themselves. Despite the few and far between events where humans redeem themselves, they still overall grovel in the basest of lives seemingly having no clue as to what they could be."
5,Difficult Subject - A call to action,"This is a tough book but one that you must read.Mende grew up in the Nuba Mountains in Sudan. Her family and her tribe are black Africans who lived in peace until the government of Sudan (Arabs in contrast) raided her village and disrupted their peaceful and simple existence. While both followers of Islam, the Nuba were viewed as inferior due to their race and Mende was taken from her family and enslaved. She was stripped of her identity as a Nuba, forced to forgo her faith (one that she shared with those enslaving her), and treated as disposable.Her story is remarkable in that she survived. Many of her friends taken captive with her did not. This is an unremarkable story in that there are an estimated 27 million slaves worldwide.My suggestion: read this book and then find some way to help the 27 million Mende's of the world that are relying on you to put an end to slavery for good."
2,Fact or Fiction,Large portions of this book appear to be copied directly from Wikipedia. This leads me to belive that the story is largely a novel.
5,The kind of book that too rarely comes around,"I purchased this book on a Saturday & began reading it around 11pm. By 6am Sunday morning, I was finished. This is an amazing story that will not only captivate your mind, but also clench your heart. As an avid reader of non-fiction books, this is the type of book that keeps my interest at peak!Told exceptionally well, allowing the reader to develop a vivid mental picture of Mende's experiences. While it does touch on some unbelievable rituals & horrendous violations that continue today; the author maintains dignity and is vague where necessary.I believe this book is appropriate for those over 12 & have recommended it to everybody I talk to. Buy it, read it, pass it on."
5,Do not turn away...,"from this heart wrenching story.I was browsing at the local public library when the word Slave caught my eye. I can not believe the life that Mende went through at the hands of her enslavers. I finished reading it in 1 day and could not believe how horrible it is that slavery exists today in the 21st century.Mende's happiness, pain and suffering pulled me into her world through words. After I finished reading it, I went to research some information on Amnesty International and the Anti-Slavery's websites to learn more. I recommend this book to everyone because we must as a society learn about these acts and do something about them. Just because we may be a world away does not mean that they do not affect us.Peace and love to all those suffering in our world."
5,Magical Christmas music,"I bought Christmas at the Movies this year, and I love Michael Chertock's piano music. He's an amazing performer. His arrangements are whimsical and intricate. The CD includes beloved classics like ""Carol of the Bells"" from The Santa Clause and ""Christmastime is Here"" from A Charlie Brown Christmas, as well as lesser-known (to me) works, like ""Somewhere in My Memory"" from Home Alone and ""Sally's Song"" from The Nightmare Before Christmas. My favorite tracks are ""It Came Upon a Midnight Clear""/""What Child Is This?"" and ""Silent Night""/""Come, Thou Long Expected Jesus."" The CD is full of heart, wonder, and Christmas spirit. Today I was feeling stressed out and this CD pulled me right out of my blues. Can't recommend it highly enough!!"
3,Canned music has value!,I did not realize that this collection was not a collection of the actual performers. But .. it was actually quite good for what i call 'canned music.'
1,Rejected Julia Child,"Paul Brooks should also be remembered for making one of the biggest blunders in the history of publishing. He rejected Julia Child's classic French cookbook as being ""too big and expensive"" to publish and sent her on her way. As a result, she returned her $250 advance and took her 700 page manuscript to Knopf, and made millions of dollars for that publisher and well as herself."
5,just enjoy it,"I just love it because every time I enter a place or a classroom or anywhere, people around me notice it and ask mewhat this exquisite perfume is ."
5,Soft cuddly bulldog!,This bulldog is really a nice size for a child to cuddle!!! We went on a search for a bulldog b/c my son had brought the bulldog mascot home from his school and absolutely LOVED it! This was really the only bulldog that was as large as the one that he brought home. But he really like soft animals so I was so pleased when we opened the box and it was velvetty soft:) He sleeps with him every night! LOVES it!!! (He's 5 1/2 years) Plus its face is very realistic....and we have little bulldogs ourselves so we know!
5,real,this dog has all the features that a bulldog has the wrinkles around his nose are so realstic and the dog is very well made .the stuffing is positioned in all the right places and is nothing like what you can buy in the mass stores.
3,Interesting read...,"I especially enjoyed the chapter on Sacred Sexuality. Been wondering why I'm attracting women with kink. Noticing that I felt a level of discomfort in regards to their direction. Working with energy myself, now I have a better understanding of what I was feeling."
5,really great!!,"This is a great book as are all in the series. Words of wisdom are very shamanic, beautifuly written. We have a responsibility to take care of Mother Earth."
5,Marciniak tying it all together,"Thank you to Barbara Marciniak for making it possible for us to understand what is going on. If her other channellings resonated with you, this one ties it all together. Many 'universal' items discussed.... if you have read any Jose Arguelles books, both authors/channellers are giving us guidepaths. This book also gets into and reminds one to breath, meditate, etc... with good advice for us all. Many ideas are reiterated in many different ways, and I think that repetition is good teaching. This book is a great service."
5,Great book!,I love all her books. I have really enjoyed reading them. It gave you some food for thoughts. I often read her books more than once. I found some of the exercises provided in this book really helpful.I would recommend The Hathor Material for those who is interested in reading similar type of books.
5,this book was important for me,"This was an important book for me. It helps to clarify for me about what it means to be a conscious participant - a contributor to the energy of the omniverse. As for the source, the idea of the Pleidians is no more strange than Abraham or Seth; the important thing is the content. I don't accept everything in this book as absolute gospel - there is no such book. But I've taken much from this one. My hilighter is worn out and I've scrawled in many of the margins. Thank you, Ms. Marciniak."
3,not easy to read,ok it has a large amount of knowledge in a small space and it can be used as a quick reference while in hospital if you are not a fan of electronic editions that serve this purpose much better. But there is no way to read this book unless you have studied before much larger text books to be able to connect the missing dots
1,Very Disappointed,"Like the comment of some reviewers we see on line, there are many inaccuracies in the text as well as mistakes especially when it comes to anatomy.I regret having bought this book.There are many review books better than this one"
4,"Wind from an enemy sky, Chucks review","This is an exelent book full of detail, facts, laws and rules of life. This is one of the best books ive read you should try it to."
2,Bruckner languishes while Muti looks at himself in the mirror,"You can summarize this Bruckner Fourth form Muti by asking, ""does he even care?"" The msuic is conductoed with total indifference. The very first bars should creep in mysteriously from afar; in Muti's hands they sleepwalk. He brings no tension to a single bar, although the Berlin Phil. does its best to provide excitment in the big climaxes. It's to no avail, however. I think the Gramophone was right to find this performance so lacking in conviciton as to barely merit two sentences. The fact that three reviewers at Amazon love it makes me despair -- can't they tell a dog when they hear one?"
1,"Don't bother if you are looking to learn technique, this is just a ""look at how wonderful I am"" kind of video.","Purchased this video hoping to learn more about collage technique and really what I got was a ""day in the life"" of Rex Ray. It is interesting if you LOVE Rex Ray, but don't purchase if you are looking for real content. This video was a complete waste of my time and I wish I could get my money back.I think it should be posted on youtube and that's about it.Also, this puff piece has been available for a long time and I find it very interesting that with one review of this painful to watch docu-self-love-fest, all of the sudden people are reviewing this as an actual video of value. These people must have been directed to give a review because they are not being very honest.I'm just sayin'."
4,"Not the best, still good","This was my first Dinosaur JR CD and one of my first CD's period so I have found memories. I bought it mainly for the song ""Feel The Pain"" which starts off the CD. It's a now classic mid nineties indierock song with some great breaks and speed changes. If any of the songs by J Mascis might ever have been a big hit this is the song. There are some other good songs, mostly in the beginning like ""I Don't Think So"" and ""Grab It"".If you already own some Dinosaur JR records and like them you should get this. If you are interested in the later Dinosaur and don't own anything yet get 'Where You Been'"
4,behind the times,"Took a chance on this bargain bin gem. It is the first time I have heard this band, but I thought it was fresh and listenable the whole way through (at 10+ years old) . My main criteria was that it sounded good. Not sure why anyone would just give this 1 star, other than it might not be as good as their other stuff is supposed to be. I'm even more eager to check out their earlier efforts."
3,LACK CONSISTENCE,Dinosaur Jr. simply doesn't have the consistence or ability to make an album with eleven good songs. This is the failure of this album. It should haev less and better songs.
4,Not Bad,"I saw Dinosaur Jr. In either Blender or Rolling Stone, then I came online and listened to ""Feel The Pain"" I loved it right away. I loved their remake of Cure's ""Just Like Heaven"" and another fav song is ""I Dont Think So"", This may not be their best album but its a very good one."
1,DinoLOU Jr,"Lou Barlow. Thats about all that I have to say about this one. Granted J.Mascis is still an indie guitar god, but the band never sounded so good as with Ol' Lou. I suggest you check out some Sebadoh instead of this album"
1,Not Biblical,This is a video about a rock band! The description on the TiVo interface for renting Amazon videos made no mention of this.
4,Teen Titans Rocks!,"Teen Titans is an awesome show! I love it; it is humorous, and filled with action. Each character has their own unique individual characteristics. Raven is my favorite. But why only put six episodess in the first edition? Someone please explain that to me."
1,This is not Teen Titans,This show joins the long list of comic cartoon abominations. And it's done in anime. Maybe someday they'll do a Teen Titans: The Animated Series.
1,"Psuedo Anime,","Okay this is starting to piss me off, why the heck are there so many anime imitations coming out? Its so freakin annoying!!!!!! The people who made this think they can do anime but they cant. The charcaters are lame, the story is totally cliche'd and the voiceacting is horrible. The thing that makes me mad is the fact that true authentic anime like Inu Yasha, Cowboy Bebop, and Akira, are totally shunned by much of the american public, while this crap is considered great. It's totally unfair, americans just can't do anime, they try but they cant, so they should stop trying!!!!"
1,....They actually publich trash.,"I'm sorry to all of you Teen Titans fans out there but Teen Titans is a terrible show. It lacks creativity. I Think it gives anime a bad name and I am ticked that whoever made this is trashing anime. Sorry, but this is not bad, do not get it."
4,A good one to add to your collection,"This DVD contains the first five episodes of the Teen Titans TV show. There is no bonus footage and no added or deleted scenes. While I am not a big fan of those first five episodes, what swayed me into purchasing the DVD was the interview with Marv Wolfman and George Perez, the two individuals who created the Titans. I found it interesting to hear how they went about re-developing the comic, what goals they had for it, etc.If you are a fan of the Titans TV show, then this is probably a good DVD to add to your collection. However if you are just out surfing for a good cartoon to watch over and over again, and have no interest in the Titans or their creators, then you may wish to pass on this disc."
1,Teen Titans......NOT!!!!!!,"I normally don't write reviews on items so trust me if I take the time to write about how absolutely bad this DVD is it means something. If you are expecting some great animation and stories similar to the George Perez Titan days FORGET IT. The target audience is for kids 6 and younger. The characters are far too silly for this to be good story telling. This is by far the worst animated series ever made based on comic characters. DC and Warner get a big, fat ""F"" for this! Go back and try again!"
2,Only comes as ONE and NOT a set...less than decent condition!,"I was disappointed that it didn't come as a set but rather one at a time. So, it cost me over fifty bucks to get a set of 12 lbs dumbells (including shipping). That's hardly a deal. If anything, it's a straight rip off. Plus one of my dumbells has this very sharp pointy thing coming out of the part that where the handle meets the bulk portion of the dumbell. It's sharp enough to rip open my finger. I guess I'll have to buy a heavy duty metal file to file it down or something because it's definitely a trip to the hospital and 4 stitches in the making. I'm guessing the seller of this item is selling ""seconds"" or less than perfect items he/she/it picked up from a manufacturer that decided these units can't be sold in a regular store."
4,Nice Illustrations,"The strength of this book is the illustrations. Great style, I think, very nice colors and pictures. The writing is adequate. My 3 y.o. loves it. I am very happy with the purchase."
4,Good Book,"Would you ever want to face a giant ogre? That's what happens to Jack in Jack and the Beanstalk retold by Val Biro. Jack trades a cow for magic beans that end up growing into a beanstalk. I like this book because it is exciting. I like all the characters in the book, especially the giant. Jack plants the missing beans, see what grows!"
2,30 YEARS OF MADNESS,"The production values in GOH are fine, which confused me because nothing else in the mix made sense. Sociopathic yakuza alienates everyone all the time, again and again and still gets treated well and honored in 'legend'.Oh. That '30 years of madness' was written on his cell wall after he'd used, betrayed, denigrated and killed all who helped him. It'd say '93 Minutes of Madness' re this docu- nightmare."
3,"Tacit knowledge, explicit knowledge, cultural knowledge","Enterprise integration is a must today and this can be achieved by combining infostructure and infrastructure resources. Choo's prescription here provides a framework for assessment of knowledge management using best business practices in Web-based environments. It, also, facilitates furthering knowledge management studies in relation to return on investment in a corporate culture. To achieve this end a direct route is prescribed in this book. It has to be based on the integration of organizational knowledge, i.e. using Choo's favorite trio: tacit knowledge, explicit knowledge and cultural knowledge."
5,Blew my socks off!,Some great information presented in a refreshingly simple and unassuming manner. Definitely one book I'll reference again and again!
5,Read and re-read,"This book has an incredible amount of information about dowsing and taking charge of your life. I intend to read it again. It is an empowering source for anyone who has used the pendulum to answer questions, but not to actively neutralize or energize effects. I have much to learn. I am so grateful to Ramon Grace for writing it all down. This is a good book to have on hand."
1,A fantasy book,"This is a strange, disjointed and irrational book. It starts out making sense but the farther you read into it, the more fantastic it becomes. It is a big fantasy and should be read as fiction. The guy is a mix of dowser and magician. He claims to be able to control people a world away. If you want to believe that stuff be my guest. But it strikes me as the worst sort of nonsense that appeals to people who want life to be something other than what it actually is. If you live in a dream land then you can join Raymon in his but don't be surprised when reality bites you."
2,died quickly,"didn't expect it last long, but died long before I expected and not because of wear. Even new, it was hard to get to work in the different varieties (sound, touch, etc.) not complaining much because of my expectations, but really wasn't more than a 2 day affair for my daughter (then 6)"
4,Indistinguishable from magic,"My brother plans to incorporate this gadget, somehow, into a steampunk outfit. He says it is just the right size."
3,Nice. But very fragile.,There should be a warning sticker that it is fragile.More so than it appears from the outside. The glassseems thick and tough. But I dropped it once on asoft vinyl floor and it broke the tube projectionon the inside.
3,Good price but a sticky switch..,"The power switch had some resistance that made it difficult switching between ""on"" and ""sound activated"". It took a few times of switching back and forth to get a proper response. A good price when I got it and will be getting one in blue soon."
1,get Kunzel instead,"I don't understand the fascination with this young conductor. Everything he's doing has been done better by Erich Kunzel. If your not familier with Kunzel's work then try his name in amazon's search engine. He's made over 60 albums, most of them for Telarc, an American record company that makes the best sounding cd's available today"
4,"Nice Iron, Great for the price.","This is a low cost iron with a few things found on higher priced irons. If you are planning on using this for hobby work, this will more than fit your needs. Feels sturdy and well built. I like the control that you have over the heat. It's a dial so you have a lot of different setting you could use, not just an on off button. The station hold is nice and sturdy. Again, for the price you are getting a nice tool. I don't know how it would hold up if you were to use it every day, but that is not what I bought it for."
3,Decent buy.,Its a soldering station. It works for smaller projects and cleans up easy and is good for its price. Nothing too fancy but gets the job done.
1,1 star,The tip was not what I needed for stained glass work and could not find the correct tip for it.
5,"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent!","Upon purchasing this item, I thought, this is probably going to tell me the same thing I have heard thousands of times before..how to ""Get over your feelings with being abused."" Much to my surprise, this was the one tool that helped me the most in my life! Being in counseling for 8 years of my life for emotional, physical and sexual abuse in my childhood, listeing to this tape helped me more. After listening to the tape for the first time I felt enlightened and more at peace. It explored the specific area in my recovery that I could not figure out how to get past: Forgiving my parents. It helped me understand that they did the best they could and that they themselves as children had lived a childhood like I had. This tape was so inspirational and helped me move forward to a healthier place in my life! The best self-help tool I have ever used!"
4,An Excellent Album,"Garrett's neo-bop-funk approach to the alto is a perfect compliment to his intense, focused sound. These two signature aspects of his playing are brought out in Triology to a great extent. Although the live Kenny Garrett is the best, this one's as good as they come"
1,Platinum Wheel Cleaner,Mess of a sale. Vendor advertised one product but shipped a later replacement which is inferior. Took ages to get the product returned and credited.
1,This CD is TERRIBLE,"I saw The Middle on MTV and liked it so I went ahead and bought the CD. It was a terrible mistake. Most of the songs on this CD are slow and tasteless. I wouldn't even call this rock that's how slow it is. I bought this CD and was very dissapointed. You will be to, so I'm warning you, DON'T BUY IT. I brought it back and got Metallica Master Of Puppets. Now there's a CD that's worth buying!"
2,a good album but...,where's the heat and substance i became so fond of on clarity? remember For me this is heaven? that was beautiful stuff. i'm not sure what to make of this new one. i'll have to go back to my shins and new death show records until jimmy puts out a new one.
4,So this is emo...,"Jimmy Eat World are very talented; I love the vocals! ... the musical quality of this CD is very promising. I love ""Bleed American,"" ""Sweetness,"" ""Your House,"" and ""If You Don't, Don't."" I would recommend this CD to ... well, anyone. It's awesome."
4,"Oh yeah, Jimmy Eat World",I loved this album but can anyone help me out? Can you tell me what order their other albums came out in?
4,Jimmy's just Great !,"I had never heard this band before they released the song ""Bleed American"". And when I heard that song, well I loved it. So I now have the album, and it rocks. It's the perfect nu Rock album. Songs like ""Sweetness"", ""Hear You Me"" and ""Get It Faster"" are the best on it. So if you wanna get something new and fresh. Don't be afraid to get this one, it will be worth it. /Micke."
3,What happened to rock and roll,"For a band that bills itself as a rock and roll band, there was all together too much wierd techno backround. I love what these guys do with alternative instruments (piano, chimes, etc.), but the electronic effects were a little overdone on this album.I downloaded some demo songs long before the release and was amazed at the work that JEW had done. ""If you don't, don't"", ""Evil #1"", ""Sweetness"" and ""splash turn twist"" were beautiful, heart wrenching songs. When I bought the CD, I was disappointed. The electronic effects in ""If you don't, don't"" and ""Evil #1"" took away from the rock and roll feel, making it almost into pop. Sweetness was completely redone and, in my opinion, not as good as the original. And, to my dismay, ""Splash, Turn, Twist wasn't even on the US CD. Poor show.Buy this CD if you love JEW's previous albums. You might be a tad disappointed, but it's worth it for Cautioners and Our House which sound a lot like their old stuff"
