1,TREMENDOUSLY bad movie,"About a dozen reviewers were able to be honest with themselves and say this movie was not funny at all. Like a David Lynch movie, or Sun Tzu's Art Of War, it must be one of those things you have to pretend that you ""get"" so you can be cool. I dunno, maybe its just dated. Just because someone says its a classic doesnt mean you are compelled to laugh, though."
3,THE DOUBLE SECRET IS: LOUSY EXTRAS,"It's still the great movie I remember - but ""double secret probation edition""? What's so special?? There are no out-takes (even though it's noted that the first cut had over a hour of extra footage), the ""mockumentary"" is simply lame, and who needs another ""featurette"" with the usual talking heads saying how great things were and that everyone was a genius? Putting previews before the menu and inserting an ad in the box add further insult to injury.If you already own this on dvd or video, save your money for the next re-release ... if you don't, just rent it!"
1,OVER-RATED,"This has got to be the most-OVERRATED comedies of all time,I have no idea why everyone haved been raving about this silly SO-CALLED CULT-CLASSIC,sure that's what i expect from a movie like this and i do enjoy the genre,but the cookie-cutter script just frankly lacks BREAK-AWAY humor and the humor is too dull for my taste,I'll go with PORKYS,FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT or REVENGE of the NERDS anyday!! not to mention the LACK-LUSTER transfer of the DVD."
1,Horrible,"What a horrible movie. Obviously, I wasn't expecting an intellectual exercise or deep meaming, but I was expecting humor. Even just cheap funny gags would have been ok. It wasn't funny, not even the cheap jokes. Maybe I would have thought this was funny when I was 18."
1,French point of view,"Let me tell you one thing about France. Most of your great movies are also famous here as most French people love American movies. So I was surprised when I heard from that movie while staying in your country whereas I had never heard from it back in France. I thought I should give it a try. I was expected a funny movie, maybe a little dated but a good funny one such as Porky's ( also famous in France )or Revenge of the nerd. The DVD came out a few days ago for a cheap price so I bought it. I am so disappointed! and confused! Why would anybody consider this movie a classic? I now understand why it was not released in France. They knew it would be a flop. Don't get me wrong, I like crazy humor but this so dumb. A few scenes are funny but most of the movie is boring. If this movie came out today for the first time, nobody would really pay attention to this joke. If you have never seen it, you should rent it first. You will thank later."
2,Disappointing,"The extras on this disk are laughable. By that, I don't mean that you'll laugh at them. The ""Reunion"" video is 20+ minutes of unscripted bore--the music video is pointless (and there, why, exactly?) The documentary is okay, but you've probably seen it on TV.The movie is, as always, very funny. But I bought it the first time, didn't you? And I fall into line right behind the people who hate the ""locked-in"" previews. Why should I pay for a disk that forces advertisement down my throat? I hate this trend at the movie theatre, too. Perhaps Universal would like to send me a check every time I watch their ad on my disk."
5,"So funny, I almost fell out of the chair","This is not the theater version and most definitely not the TV version.This is the uncut version the way the writers orginally intended. It probably will offend some people and is not for young children, but so funny I almost fell out of the chair many times."
4,Still funniest ever,"To me this movie was more than just a comedy, it was my life. A virtual biography about me, and for me. My college dorm was similar in fact to the Delta's, but enough about me. John Belushi made me gag because I was laughing so hard at his faces and his poor hygene. The humor is so utterly tasteless that it actually works very tastefully. This movie is definately not for everyone, but if you're in college and you still have a little space for humor in your life, then there's no reason not to see this."
2,The Movie is fine but...,"...I don't care about Universal's future releases and I resent that I can't skip their previews every time I stick in a disk that I own. It's bad enough I have to sit through 20 minutes of trash at the movie theatre, I don't want to have to do it at home, too....the ""Class Reunion"" extra is unfunny. I'm not even sure there was a script for it. If they weren't really going to try, why did they bother?...I already own ""Animal House"" on DVD. How often are they going to play this trick on DVD owners? I'm tired of buying a disc only to have it followed up by a disk with more extras a year or so later. Phooey on that. I'm not playing that game anymore. Let them eat re-releases or do it right in the first place!"
5,Watch it and laugh.,"What the heck was ""Th3e House of High Fidelity"" talking about a few reviews back? ""'Animal House' has not survived the advance in comedy that we are now experiencing in film today.""? Huh? What are those advances in comedy? Do you mind telling us?The only advance in comedy that anyone need care about is if it makes you laugh. And this movie will make you laugh. And BTW Mr.""Th3e House of High Fidelity"", the movie takes place in the early 60s not the 50s."
4,True To A Point,"A very entertaining movie, truly a college classic! While the lifestyles of the college fraternity have changed drastically since the ""Toga, Toga, Toga"" days of the 60's, it still serves as a cult favorite among many of America's youth. Watch and enjoy, but don't buy into all of it. Like any other comedy, it's purely fictional."
1,I third that!,"I just put this DVD in and haven't even watched it, but that will not stop me from giving this title a 1 - and that's only because they don't allow negative ratings! Mandatory COMMERCIALS that you cannot skip are completely and utterly unacceptable for any DVD I purchase. I'll wait in the future for reviews before I buy any DVDs...I like the movie, and the transfer looks ok from the first few minutes, its too bad I had to pay to watch a commerical..."
1,Double Secret Probation Edition = RIPOFF,I own the original release on dvd. I purchased the new release Double Secret Probation under the false pretenses that there was a difference. The few bonus features and lack of quality thereof leave this DVD lacking.Good job hollywood .. and you wonder why everyones stealing movies?
5,back down memory lane,"a handful of laughs, along with faternity style pranks and college binge drinking atmosphere filled me up with enough laughs for the rest of the real. this movie was also in great condition."
4,Classic,"Classic movie. Pretty much a must see, still relevant despite how long ago it was made. I'm not a huge comedy fan but this one is definitely hard to beat."
2,DVD's are supposed to be better!,I just put the movie in and I can't watch it yet because it has a lot of previews that you can't skip. It really pisses me off.
2,"Great movie, bad DVD","In short, my only gripe with the film is the 3 advertisements (totaling about 10-15 minutes) at the beginning that play before the menu loads. There's no way to skip over them and if I OWN the disk I feel like I shouldn't be held captive by ads before getting to enjoy it."
1,Buy the 1998 DVD release instead,"I purchased this and then returned it after learning of the five minutes of previews and commercials that are required to be played before getting to the movie. Universal, long the worst DVD producer in Hollywood, has outdone themselves with this one. Who would consider sitting through five minutes of junk that cannot be forwarded past every time they want to see this film? Ridiculous. After their problems with the Back the Future II and III recall and the Jurassic Park disc mail-in, you'd think they'd try harder not to inconvenience their fans. They clearly don't care. So I don't care to buy their products."
3,GREAT MOVIE ...but,"I loved everything on this DVD, it was a good transfer of it, plus its one of my favorite movies of all time, and the special features were fun....however.I am having a SERIOUS problem with DVDs having unstoppable, unskipable previews in the beginning of them. YES it is nice to know that Scarface is going to come out on DVD soon, but do I HAVE TO WATCH THAT EVERY SINGLE TIME I PUT IN MY MOVIE????? If it really were a collectors edition, it would just be the movie and NOTHING else but the movie. There is only one FIX for this is to push fastforward up to 16x. Luckily I found that out, because don't even think of pushing the MENU key, or SKIP key because they won't work.Its sad they have to mar our films like this.I would still recommend this Title though, because its just so funny and the movie itself is so great. No use waiting til they have one without any stupid previews in the beginning, cuz it won't happen."
3,Doesn't quite live up to my memory,"In my head, this was a fast paced hysterical tribute to an earlier time with loads of laughs and many bright new stars. I recently re-watched it and it's almost painfully slow and all the funny bits are the ones I remember. There were no surprises and I wouldn't bother seeing it again."
5,Christmas Present,How can you go wrong with Animal House?? This will always be a classic in our house. the shipping was on time and in perfect condition.
5,Great movie!,This has been one of our favorite movies for years! We were so glad it came out on Blu-ray and love having it on two discs so we can watch it in different rooms.
4,nice quality,"I saw the ads at the beginning, and just fast forwarded through them. Guess my XBox didn't care. :)But it's nice to have a really good quality version of the film. I just wish it was wide screen."
5,Let the good time roll!!!!!!!!,"This movie is a great comedy classic!!!!!!!! Everything about this movie is great from the acting, music, and settings just make this movie a masterpiece for comedy. If you want a great laugh get this movie."
3,Couldn't Quite Love It,"I hadn't actually seen Animal House all the way through until I bought this DVD. It left me with a bit of an ambivalent feeling; there were a couple of instances of actual guffaws but ultimately it didn't sustain it for me. I find the Blues Brothers, made in the same time frame more enjoyable. The blame for the disaffection probably rests in the numerous spoofs, various homages, and references in other popular culture offerings to Animal House that have appeared over the years. When the original is viewed with the heightened expectations it somehow pales a bit. I well understand that this is considered a low-brow comedy cultural watermark film, but I couldn't make the connection required to love it. Belushi's rousing speech at the end is masterful though. :)"
4,It would be better if the film wasn't set in 1962!,"This 1978 comedy Animal House is funny, disgusting, low budget and like most of the teen movies the rules no longer applied because the young people here are WACKY!!!There are also a lot of naughty words, some alcohol and drug use and many nudity scenes.When I heard that the film was set in the 60's I thought that it would be a crazy hippie rebel movie with soundtracks of the Rolling Stones, Beatles, Cream, Hendrix and more but I got it WRONG! There isn't a lot of soundtracks here and the main song of the movie is Louie Louie!!If the film was set in 1962 then the students and the fad had the 50's in mind.I guess this movie wasn't what I was looking for.P.S: I heard about another movie of the seventies set in the 60's called American Graffiti but is also set in 1962.Adios."
3,Forced to watch promos,"Everyone else seemed to cover the content of the DVD, but I'd just like to rant about a new device that Universal has forced on the DVD buying public where everytime you want to view the disc you have to sit through several promos for upcoming releases. It took about 8 minutes before the main menu would come up and, at least my player would not allow me to forward to the menu earlier promting the warning ""Not Permitted"" when I would try. But thankfully, I only rented this, so I'm only slightly bitter.:-)"
1,I 4th 5th etc it!,"I ADORE Animal House. Is it THAT hard to do this the right way? C'mon, a decent Audio Commentary, an easter egg or two, and for God's sake, get your advertising across some other way without those *$!@#+ ads. Thanks for nuttin."
1,Terrible -- forced to watched series of awful trailers,"Here it is, Friday night, finally, after a long, hard week at the office. Would love nothing more than to watch one of my favorite movies with my girlfriend...but no, I'm forced to sit through an unbearable onslaught of ads, each and every time I click the ""stop"" button. After 30 minutes, I'm still unable to watch Animal House and my beloved Flounder. For shame! A pox on all of the houses of the corporate overloads who saw fit to cram these awful ads down our throats. 0 stars, if possible."
1,Non adequate to customers system,Impossible to play due to different system for reproduction. No previous information warning about reproduction system.A real pitty.
5,Animal House is a Classic.,"National Lampoon's Animal House, Right off the bat this is National Lampoon's Best Movie. This is the Best Frat/College Movie there is.John Belushi As Bluto is Hilarious and my favorite character. the Brief Cameo of the Corvette is lamentable. The Scene with the Horse and the new pledge is very funny. The Special feature ""Where are they now""? where they have the characters of the movie as the characters was not so funny and a bad attempt on Landis' part."
2,Why not add something new?,"I've always felt that ANIMAL HOUSE was one of the funniest comedies ever filmed, and I rejoice in the widescreen format, improved mastering and the Dolby audio... but I only gave this lousy re-release two stars.Why? Well, I hope someone at Universal is reading these reviews: DUMP THE MANDATORY PREVIEWS! And what about better content? The featurettes seem hastily-made and almost amateurish. I wanted to see deleted scenes, like the legendary Stork and his slide rules -- I wanted outtakes, or more footage taken while the film was being produced.If you already own the original release (like I do), then don't bother with this unless you have to have the widescreen format or the Dolby audio."
1,Where are the songs???,"This film is one of the films I like most. I just love the Rock and Roll era, although I was born in the 70's. And ""Animal House"" has the smell of that era.For the film I would give 5 stars, but for that DVD edition I give just one.Why??? Well, most of the original soundtrack was substituted by unknown songs. Sam Cooke's Twisting the Night Away, Wonderful World and Money, Let's Dance and others just disappeared from the DVD edition...I'm totally disappointed because a 50's or 60's movie MUST have songs from the period. OK...Louie Louie is there, but only Louie Louie...I think Universal had some troubles with the rights of that songs. OK...but why don't let us know it???In spite of it, the DVD is still worth of buying, but for sure the new sound track is terrible surprise for this film lovers."
1,"Classic movie, bad DVD","The movie is an absolute classic, BUT this DVD forces you to watch several minutes of commercials at the beginning with NO way to skip them. I don't mind if they have the commercials, just give me the ability to skip them....bad marketing IMO.I think I'm going to buy the out-of-print version of this DVD from eBay."
3,"Great movie, terrible video","Unless you've spent the last 20 years on the far side of Mars you know the story of ""Animal House"". Suffice to say that this is one of the funniest movies of all time. Which is unfortunate because this is also one of the worst dvds I have ever seen. The picture is grainy, the brightness level changes almost continuously, and the sound is muddy at best. I realize that this is no ""Citizen Kane"", but you would think Universal would have taken more care with the release of such a popular movie. I have heard that the ""special edition"" of Animal House is better, but I'm not risking it. Rent this one before you buy."
1,no more advertising!,"enough!!!! i do not want to be forced to watch advertising on DVD's I buy. this DVD forces you to watch previews, even if you do not want to see them."
3,Film was good but it didn't quite live up to it's rep,"When I was 10 AH hit theatres. Naturally I didn't get to see it on it's release (though you can bet I wanted to). I assumed there was tons of nudity and sex going on and other stuff. When I finally did see it (many years later) I couldn't believe how tame it all really was. Tame in the sense it was mostly nude-and-sex free. It also wasn't anywhere near as funny as it was supposed to be from the reports I heard of it when I was a kid (neither was Monty Python but that's another story).This film is basically a (actually) good-hearted, semi-accurate nostalgia look at life just before Vietnam changed America."
3,Has not aged well,"This film provides a few chuckles, but that is about all. Aside from three or four scenes featuring John Belushi (the food fight not being one of them), I don't find it at all funny. Perhaps I witnessed too many frat boy shenanigans while in college, but in this movie these seem more irritating than they do amusing. I don't find myself caring about any of the shallow, one dimensional characters and it drags on way too long at the end. The section at the very end, which shows what happens to each character in the future, might have been novel at the time. Now, however, it comes across as a cliché, and a not very funny one at that."
5,25 YEARS AND STILL PARTYING TOGA-STYLE!,"Finally, Universal is giving their cult classics the special treatment they deserve! Now, those of us who were unable to get a copy of the now OOP (out of print) Animal House DVD are going to get a special treat with the all new DOUBLE SECRET PROBATION Edition of Animal House on DVD!!! Just in time for its 25th Anniversary as well! I can't wait to get my copy this August! What else can I say?LET'S DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,RUDE FARCE STILL CONNECTS,"""Fat, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life, son."" After 25 years, ANIMAL HOUSE Double Secret Probation (Universal) arrives in a fresh digital transfer with MTV-like pop-ups that footnote the movie. John Landis' film spoofed frat life and spawned a whole sub-genre of teen gross-out flicks. The crazed genius of John Belushi explodes with his sustained incarnation of Bluto Blutarsky. Crude, irreverent, offensive but still fun. Groove with the Otis Day rendition of ""Shout"" in a newly minted 5.1 sound mix."
5,Must have for your...,College days collection. Makes me want to join a POS frat house and tear it up! Good times.
5,Best Comedy Ever,"I love this movie. In fact we watch this movie at every tailgate party. Great, great movie!"
2,THEY COULD HAVE TRIED A LITTLE HARDER ON THIS ONE TOO!,"They call this a re-mastered soundtrack ?!?!It's very hard to find what reason UNIVERSAL found in re-releasing this film on DVD. The video quality is the same as in the last edition and the same pretty much goes also for the audio. All that this proves is how easy it is to make a buck by giving a new edition a colorful name.UNIVERSAL has let customers down with their ""improved"" versions of this (classic) movie as well as SCARFACE but they can be sure we will remmember their record when their future releases come out! And regarding their forced commercials, they can rest assured some of us will simply refuse to buy whatever they advertise in this manner just by principle !"
1,More about unstoppable previews,"I am going to return this DVD, and any other DVD that I purchase in the future that makes me watch 5 minutes of previews before allowing me to get to a menu EVERYTIME I insert the disk.Further, although I'm not 100% sure, I think there have been changes made to the soundtrack, in that some of the original songs have been removed and replaced with others. More insult.Recommend you STAY AWAY."
1,Say no to Universal's FORCED spam on DVDs,"Thanks to the other reviews here I now know not to buy this DVD. Forcing you to watch a ton of commercials every single time you put the disc in your player is apalling. Stay away from Universal's DVDs unless they knock it off. If you're the type of person who loves having an inbox full of spam, you should enjoy this DVD."
1,Really mad about this DVD,"I purchased this DVD expecting a professional movie, instead it is filled with commercials that cannot be skipped. This is disgusting"
1,Send a message. Avoid this DVD.,I am returning this DVD tomorrow. I refuse to sit through 5 minutes of previews everytime I want to watch the movie I paid for. I own hundreds of DVDs and this is the first that forced me to watch anything other than the annoying FBI Warning. Send a message. Don't buy this DVD. Don't let this start a trend. At least with VHS you could fast forward.
1,Mandatory advertisements are RIDICULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I love Animal House and bought this DVD so I could watch Animal House. I did not buy 4 minutes of mandatory advertisements every time I put the disc in. There is no way to skip past them. TO UNIVERSAL: do you think that by making me watch this every time I will be more likely to buy your movies?? Never again will I purchase a DVD from Universal without first finding out if it has advertisements.
5,forget the trailers / previews - they're history (at least for now),"No trailers nor previews on my DVD (at least as of December 2005). Just the movie, features, etc. The Great ... Animal House."
2,Double Secret Disappointment,"Animal House is and always will be one of my all time favorite films. I couldn't wait to see ""Double Secret Probation"". I was keenly disappointed! The add ons barely made me smile. Buy this DVD only if you don't own already own Animal House. If you already have it, save your money & skip this one."
5,All time Classic Comedy,"In my opinion, the funniest movie ever made. John Belushi is absolutely hysterical, particularly as he makes his way through the cafeteria. Classic line: ""What we need is an incredibly stupid gesture on somebody's part"" .... ""and we're just the ones to do it""."
5,SIZZLING!,"Far too sophisticated and complex for most people, this epic saga demonstrates the courage and intestinal fortitude needed to traverse that lonely bridge from adolesence to young adulthood. In it, our heroes experience everything from humiliation to degradation to physical pain. Racial tension is presented as just another obstacle en route to manhood. The issues of sexuality, drug and alcohol abuse, and subjugation by superiors, are not ignored. A tense courtroom scene midway through the story underscores the genius of modern film-making techniques. Brilliant!"
4,A Classic Comedy,"This 1978 film by John Landis follows the wild adventures of a group of fraternities on the campus of Faber College. There are many familiar faces in Animal House, but John Belushi as ""Bluto"" stole the show. John Belushi's, as well as the other member's of the Delta House's, parties, food fights, cheating on test, vandalism is just a few reasons why Dean Wormer wanted to rid the campus of The Delta House. Delta House was comprised of fun-loving, sloppy, middle class guys who drank and smoked everyday and lived for pulling pranks on the Omega House Fraternity and Dean Wormer. Dean Wormer finally won the battle and kicked Delta House off the campus, but Delta House's revenge was awesome. A must see!! I give this movie 4 stars because it is truly hilarious!"
5,Classic!,I really only buy classic movies for my collection and this is about the quintesential funny movie of that decade!
5,A True Classic,"What can I say that has not already been said? A true comedy classic, one of the ten funniest films ever made. And even better, it holds up well after more than 30 years, which is more than can be said of some other comedies, whose jokes and gags are based on current events. Lastly, even though you know what is coming, and often the very lines the actors are going to say, the gags are still funny!"
4,a celebration,it is a celebration of a movie and the actors that made a great movie that has lasted through time and celebrate a great movie
1,Did not play on any DVD player. Do not buy from this seller,Seller sent me return information and I never received the credit. DO NOT buy from this seller as they should tell you that HD DVDs do not play on any machines
5,Multi generation gift,My mom gave me these books and then I gave them to my daughter. Now my daughter has given then to her friends as birthday presents. I am sure we will buy many more as the years go by.
4,A must for Lee Wiley and Bunny Berigan fans,"This is the complete set of Cole Porter sessions that Lee Wiley recorded for Liberty Records in about 1940. It includes alternate takes, false starts, and some of the dialog with the musicians and the producer. Because Bunny Berigan was featured on one of the sessions, this CD will be of interest to his fans as well.This is a fascinating opportunity to see how a group of talented musicians approach and develop a set of songs by one of this country's greatest popular composers. The fact that these session records even existed after 70 years, let alone in usable condition, is nothing short of amazing. As an added bonus, the technicians who prepared the issue did an excellent job of producing a decent recording quality, better even than the standard reissue of these sessions."
3,"interesting, not compelling","I just bought this movie, and I must say that it doesn't give compelling evidence for the real Mt. Sinai. I will give it three stars because it is interesting. One of the problems I found with the film is that the characters seamed to contradict themselves, and if you pay attention you will notice that they gave very little footage of they're findings. Sadly, I don't know of any films that deal with archeology that could replace this one, only some excellent books like ""evidence that demands a verdict"" that I think do give conclusive evidence for the historicity of the BIBLE by Josh McDowell, books from Norman Geisler, F.F. Bruce, etc."
4,Review of the Search for the real Mount Sinai DVD,"This DVD is well done, but there is another DVD that may have been made prior to or after this DVD that I believe is much better and gives credit to others involved in the exploration. The other DVD is called ""The discovery of the real Mount Sinai Mountain of Fire"". This DVD covers basically the same content. It is a very nice DVD and worth getting. I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning about current research into the finding of Mount Sinai and the Exodus of Moses and Israel from Egypt. It is absolutely fascinating what they have found that proves the truth of the Bible."
4,The Search for the Real Mt. Sinai with Free Expedition Map,I received the DVD in a timely manner except the map that was advertised I didn't receive. Perhaps an oversite or perhaps a misprint in the ad. Anyway it was more trouble than it was worth to persue.
3,Jury still out...,"Pain is subjective with this product- personally it did not hurt, but for my mother and sister, well, they're not willing to try it out after one try. I'm not sure if it is working (about two small pimples I've treated over two days are gone) as only half the pimples treated went away. it does dry up the area so using a good lotion 30 mins afterwards was helpful."
4,quick,Way quicker than the competition and you'll spend much less on tips. Seems to work just as well.
1,Did not clear my acne,"My skin started breaking out after getting pregnant. I didn't want to use any chemicals on my skin (even though some are considered to be safe during pregnancy), so I purchased this item. I used the device exactly as directed throughout my first trimester and partially in my second trimester. Honestly you get used to the pain quickly and pain was not a big issue for me. The issue was that it didn't help healing a single pimple (and I have mostly light acne). The device is supposed to heal acne faster if used when you feel it first before it emerges but that didn't work either and the ones I tried became pimples at around the normal maturation time. I stopped using this device and do not recommend it at all."
4,Works as it Claims.,"I came across this while I was research Zeno. I liked that it ran on batteries so that I didn't have to throw it away if the built-in rechargable decided to die. [...].Its slightly bigger than the Zeno and is very simple to use. Yes it does take a little getting used to - very similar to how the laser or IPL for hair removal feels though its not that intense. It has two settings, one isn't so intense so if you are sensitive, you can start off with that.The one downside is that in order to get the tip hot enough to zap those pimples, it needs to get that energy from somewhere - the 2 AA batteries. So it uses the batteries quicker than I hoped.I've had acne all of my adult life and I do believe this thing works. If you get the pimple right when it forms, it makes it disappear fast. If you get it late, it speeds up its cycle and you get rid of it much faster. I just need to be a little more diligent about using it. :-)"
3,did not notice a change,I purchased this item and used it faithfully however I really did not notice a difference in my skin. Auctually the device that I had kept shutting off on me and I had to get a new one ( which I am returning in the 30 day trial). However I must say that the customer service for ThermaClear are great. They got righ back to me and were anxious to hear about the problem I was having. I would recomend that you try it for your self and have no fear that if you don't like it you can just return it
2,Didn't live up to my expectation,"Thermaclear just didn't work well for me. I don't have serious acne, just the occasional breakout. I used as directed (and sometimes more), yet it doesn't seem to help. Plus, it's kind of painful - I still have to force myself to press the zap button."
3,So-So,"It actually will speed up the healing time if you catch the pimple early but otherwise I didnt notice that much of a difference for already existing pimples. It is also a little painful. Not too much that you cant take it but it is definatly jarring when you use it, especially in sensitive areas"
4,Helpful Book,"I was not aware of the ""confessions"" market before reading this book. Like most people I assumed the stories were true. I think the book is a bit overpriced for the content, however I did learn about a new market and how to write for it so this book gets my recommendation."
3,Not as posted!,"I bought this gun from airsplat and it posted that this particular rifle was 260 fps with .12g bb's. I get it, and I charged the battery for 12 hours the first time after draining the charge the battery did have (thats what it says to do for the first charge.) I go to shoot a cheap plastic tube that my 280 fps handgun can go through completely and it didn't even make a dent! Im guessing this rifle is around 160 fps, but has a good rate of fire!OVERALL: The gun looks and feels great! It weighs about 6 pounds which is not bad! It is made of all plastic but it isn't cheap plastic! It is very sturdy! Good gun for little backyard wars, and target practice, or just for looks! Again, the only bad thing i can think of is the fps, it isn't good at all!"
1,i wouldve rather rated it 0 stars but okay..,same here! please tell me when i'll receive my magazine. 60-something is a lot of money to pay for a magazine subscription!!
5,This book brings us back to God's divine plan,Everything can be explained when we know what God wants.
5,The best chips ever!,I am from Toronto and I tried these once from a Wal-Mart in Indianapolis. I have only found them again in Las Vegas but nowhere in New York state. Does anyone know where to find them up here - they are the best chips I have ever had!
5,OMG I love this stuff!,I use to eat the Doritos Guacamole chips. When they discontinued it I searched all over to find a replacement. It's tasty wished there was more seasoning but it definitely satisfied my appetite for guacamole and chips with a crunch. Wished they sold it individually. When I got the box it was huge for only 12/12 ounce chips. Really nice flavor with salsa hmm hmm good!
3,No real avocados here,"Although the package description states they only use the finest avocados and states they have the ""rich flavor of ripe avocados"" the ingredients list ""avocado powder"" and that is what it tastes like. Tasty, but definitely not guacamole, not spicy, and not avocado. Hmmm...."
2,The nuggets of information are gems...,"...unfortunately, the rest of the book is mud.I do think it's worth getting, but keep this in mind:The first 31 pages are infomercial: ""Let me show you how this 10% solution will change your life!""The second 31 pages are useful: ""Follow these steps to find the padding that slows your writing"" and it is helpful.The catch is this: at the end, to show how one can be succinct, Rand includes the 500 word magazine article describing this ""10% solution"" process. All the info in this $5 book boils down to 500 words. The rest is fluff. Those 500 words are very valuable, helpful, and insightful words, and I'm glad I paid my penny a word, but I guess he couldn't sell a 500 word book to a publisher, so he ""fluffed"" it to 61 pages.Ironic how this review can be 1000 words ... twice the length needed to describe the 10% solution."
5,The most succinct approach to editing I've seen.,"Ken Rand's short, no-nonsense approach to editing your own work, properly applied, will do more to make your writing appear professional than anything I've seen like it. Ken's style is funny and concise. He shows you how to go through your manuscript to tighten it, emphasizing accuracy, clarity and brevity. I've been selling professionally (Analog, Realms of Fantasy, Weird Tales) for several years, and Ken's approach still managed to trim over 500 words from a 5,000 word story that later went on to sell to a pro magazine. I've bought 20 copies to give to friends and students."
5,The 10% Solution,"As a writer, my time is precious. This outstanding book gave succinct, concise needed information. I recommend it to all writers."
5,Great little book,"I've read reviews of this book complaining it wasn't well-written, was just lists, went on endlessly for the few half the book. I say ""Whatev!"" For the newbie writer Rand gives some clear, concrete ways to begin to edit your work. If you (like me) have no idea where to start, start here. There are better books, much more to learn elsewhere, but here is a good jumping-off point."
3,Good book for Reference Libraries,This book is a good source for high school reference libraries. It gives a accurate progression of the works produced by William Faulkner.
1,Uninspiring hymnal,"I was looking for a hymnal with songs from my childhood in an Assembly of God congregation, and it sounded like this one would have the hymns I sought. Wrong!Poorly selected hymns for any congregation, poor arrangements, cheap typesetting and paper, poor index. Bad all around.It didn't cost much, but it still wasn't worth it."
5,The perfect cookie cutter.,This was the cookie cutter I was looking for. The cookies are easy to decorate and there are less cookies to make!
4,this play provides insight into subconscience racism,"this play is wonderful. not only does the reader come away with a deeper insight into the racist psyche that plagues our country, but also a clearer view of how racism is perpetuated systematicly in a subsconscience manner. it becomes very appearant that many of the racist characters in the play are truly unaware of the devestating effects their racist attitude is having on their growth as individuals. in fact, we find that we find that such characters are so misguided in their views, they often mistake them as being wholesome,that is, for the betterment of all people, and scripturally based. baldwin's depiction of this cancerous mentality is brilliant. the reader sees clearly how misguided premises can corrupt one's entire mentality."
3,Good stuff,"Solid syrup. I would give it four stars overall, if the shipping didn't cost just as much as the product."
3,Still a nice background option,"The dvd is horrid. It's great for drunken laughs, especially the candles as they appear. They should have stuck with the crackling fireplace of volume 2. The music isn't up to par with vol 1 and 2 and this one seems kind of rushed or like something is missing. The ambiance just isn't there for this one. It's great for background at parties or when you're doing holiday-related things, but for simply sitting with a cocktail and enjoying the music for what it is, not with vol 3. Pop in vol 1 or 2 for that."
1,I wish I could give this 0 stars!,"First of all, let me say that I absolutely loved Reindeer Room 1 and 2. They are the best holiday albums I've ever heard--upbeat but edgy, perfect for a hip holiday party. Over the years, my husband and I have purchased copies for my family and his, and many of our friends. Everyone has loved both CDs; in fact, Reindeer Room 1 is my father's favorite CD. He plays it year round!And so I been eagerly watching for a Reindeer Room 3. We all have. We could hardly wait--how could it be anything but fantastic?Alas, Reindeer Room 3 is the single worst album I have ever purchased. It is so bad that it seemed to be a parody of itself (especially the accompanying DVD). I gave it to my dad for Christmas, and none of us liked a single song. We were all heartbroken.So, take my advice... do not, under any circumstances, buy this album. You will be very, very sorry!"
3,Sad move by Masucci,"It's well known Lavoe could not complete this album. Jerry Massuci when listening to Van Lester thought he was the perfect singer to complete it because of their striking similarities in voice. The album itself is not fantastic nor bad. It just is. ""Telefono"" (although a different version) is a song already popularized by El Gran Combo and Ruben Blades as isn't very inspiring, just as the entire albuma. One would expect much more from Lavoe. Now,as pointed by another reviewer, the album was a very classless move by Massuci as it should not of been released. This is certainly one you could do without."
2,Not a masterwork,"This bit of capitolism bashing is not a bad novel, but if ""1984"" is worth five stars (and we all know it is) then this amusing, if somewhat forgetable, narrative can not be given half its status.Anyone who gave this book three or more stars should certainly re-evalute their opinion with the above paragraph in mind. Though, perhaps I have under-rated the book based on lofty expectations provoked by his latter work.Anyone who may have given this book five stars:Do you honestly think this first novel is the equal of a titan of literature like ""1984""?It simply doesn't deserve the same status."
3,"Well-written, but not among Orwell's best","A man declares war on money, preferring to starve rather than serve the 'money-god' of 1930's London. Orwell's writing is vivid despite the appalling hero that is Gordon Comstock. A downer that perks up at the end, I wouldn't call this one of Orwell's best, but still worth reading."
4,The Tedium Of Poverty,"It being the 100th anniversary of George Orwell I decided to read one of his books that I hadn't gotten around to yet that was recommend to me a while ago, Keep The Aspidistra Flying. It is a novel about a poet who is trying to live outside the capitalistic system with abysmal results. He vividly describes the tedium and sordidness of middle class poverty, which differs from the equally demoralizing squalid poverty of the common classes."
3,It will earn you points at cocktail parties,"There is a reason why this isn't one of Orwell's most-read books. While it isn't terrible...it isn't all that good, either. There seem to be two stories here: one is a fun satire of the classes and of the advertising industry (Do you suffer from P.O.?) and the other is a dreary examination of a peevish little man. Fortunately, the second story is sandwiched between the clever parts and, when the protagonist gets unbearable, you can just skip over the aforementioned parts. The benefit of this book is that it is short enough so that one can read it in a few sittings and, later, wow one's associates at cocktail parties with intimate knowledge of an obscure work by Orwell."
1,No more purchases of Mr. Orwell's work.,School-day nostalgia caused me to buy the book. It was a mistake; consistently depressing and often boring. Really an unpleasant little book. I will not buy any more of Mr.Orwell's work.
4,"Of Life, Love, Money, And Aspidistras","In a capitalist society, there is no way to escape the rampant worship of money. Or is there? This is the central dilemma of Geore Orwell's Keep The Aspidistra Flying.Keep The Aspidistra Flying is the story of Gordon Comstock (""common stock""?), an idealistic young man who leaves a respectable middle-class job in an effort to free himself from what he sees as the stultifying greed of bourgeois exsistence. Like that other great English novelist, Charles Dickens, Orwell trots out a varied cast of eccentric characters to keep us entertained as he makes his points. While lacking the history-stopping power of later works such as Animal Farm and 1984, Keep The Aspidistra Flying posseses a dry wit and a heartfelt charm that is all its own. Recommended to idealistic young men (and women) everywhere."
3,RATHER PATHETIC,"The protagonist Gordon Comstock is a a rather pathetic, sad character and I couldn't relate to him as anyone going anywhere and he's a kind of lifeless fellow. Can't figure out why Rosemary is so patient with him and doesn't get him of his grubby bookstore..and existence...or move on. Not Orwell's best but I had to read just to find out my friends thought the book to be a bore. Pass on it if you have something else to read."
4,Good as a replacement - key 'sticks' a bit,"I purchased this as a replacement to a nearly identical item that was originally installed on an interior door and since it was simply a case of switching out the old one, the installation process was very easy.I'm sure this will get better as the key wears down, but the key doesn't enter the lock smoothly and often needs to be jiggled a bit to make it go in."
3,"Pretty good action fare, for non-discriminating fans.","If you are looking for a prime example of a film that's surprisingly decent in spite of itself, this is it! I've heard all the negative comments regarding ""Shatter"", from the low budget to the casting of Stuart Whitman. The low budget does show at times, but this film still has a better look than many of the martial arts opuses of the 70's. Whitman has had a history of these kind of tough guy roles, usually in westerns like ""The Commancheros"" and ""Rio Conchos"", and does solid work here. And Cushing and Anton Diffring add the expected Hammer polish to the works. The action scenes move at a nice clip, which cannot be said for many films of the era. This is not ""Enter The Dragon"", but it's better than some of the others."
2,Only Slim Whitman could've been worse.,"Hammer studios known by most for their gripping horror films, produced this drama ""Shatter"". The only horror in Shatter is Stuart Whitman's acting. Shatter (Whitman) is a hitman whose government turns on him, framing him for a murder they put him up to. Mayhem and martial arts ensue. Lots of nice scenery, action, and a special appearance by Peter Cushing in his last Hammer film. Once you view this film you will understand why Whitman was cursed to play baddies in 70's television cop shows....who loves ya baby?"
3,So-so watch; arrived broken,"Unfortunately, this Armitron arrived from Amazon broken. The digital part worked fine, but the analog arms didn't move at all, so I had to return it. Good return service from Amazon. If the watch had been working it would have been all right. Kind of a nice design. I used to have an Armitron analog/digital that I loved, but they discontinued that excellent design, so I took a chance on another one. The negatives on this one are the plastic band (which might be hard to replace, since it's an unusual shape) and the loud beep each time you hit the button to change modes. I hate having to hear six or seven loud beeps every time I set an alarm or something."
3,It did not work,The one I received did not work. Received a full refund from Cables to Go.My bad luck. With this in mind Cables to Go stand behind what they sell.I`d buy from them again.
1,Broken,I received this coupler with a piece of plastic broken off on the inside of one half which prevented it from working at all. Just bad luck.
1,"Junk, bought from Amazon.","This would have been a handly little item, but the ""metal"" end came out, it screwed into plastic threads and there was no way to get it back together. I'm not actually sure it was metal.It was just junk. Used it about about 2 months. It was an Amazon Prime item. I paid 3.06 with ""free"" shipping. Not worth returning.It is very hard to find small parts like this. Too bad there is no way to be sure you are getting what you pay for."
1,Considering it a donation,"Wow, I thought I'd chance it with the negative reviews but got stung. Writing it off as a donation to the seller since sending it back is more of a hasle. When I tried all 4, the music sounds like Karaoke. I had to pull out the plug slightly on all of them to get the full signal/connection. Very poor construction. Just lousy. Probably made in China. Stay away from these."
1,Buy Extras!!,"Bought three, of which one worked. Each of the other two connected only one channel - one, the right, the other, the left. Not sure what the point is of manufacturing and selling such junk, but if you need to make the connection, buy several and maybe you'll be lucky."
1,Didn't Work.,I plugged my headphones in and could only hear out of one ear. Messed with it a little while and now it resides in the bottom of my trash can. Picked up a different one at Radio Shack this weekend and now it works fine. Oh well.
2,Hit and Miss,"I bought this coupler to use in conjunction with an extension cable to extend my ir sensor to my set-top box. When plugged in, I received no signal whatsoever . After tinkering with it for several minutes, I looked inside of it to see that the prongs were bent in a way that wouldn't allow a connection at all. After I bent them into shape I was able to get a signal which made the coupler finally usable. I wouldn't recommend this if you are not willing to do some work to the coupler. And, like I said in the title, It's hit and miss. Some say it works fine and some say what I've said. If you're worried about that I would not buy this."
4,works good for my xbox360 sound connector,came in fast i bought a set of hdmi to vga cables for my xbox360 also works to give a litte more space
1,These Suck,"I just bought these at Best Buy because I needed female RCAs, which they didn't have. The connection was so bad I couldn't even use them and now I have to take them back. I wouldn't recommend using these, steer clear if you can."
1,Does not work on RCA jacks,"I only gave the review one star so people would know this does not work with RCA jacks, like thos found on DVD players."
5,The link that never stops giving ...,The Coupler works perfectly with my audio head set. There are no compliants everything is in running order.Thank you!
3,"one worked, one didn't",Ordered 2 of these.. only needed 1 but figured I should have another just in case I need it later. Turned out to be a good thing too since one came physically damaged on the inside and couldn't even have anything plugged into one side of it. The other works great.Not really worth trying to return since they're so cheap lol.
1,doesn't work,"won't accept male plugs. I'm not sure if I got the one bad one or if this is a regular problem. Fortunately, it is cheap enough for me not to bother to return it."
1,Doesn't work,"Mine didn't work, simple as that, not worth the time or hassle to send it back, just went to radioshack and bought one for 10x the price, but at least it worked."
4,Springs are a little tough,"It works fine, but seems to have excessive spring tension that fights you plugging in the male connectors. I put a dab of silicone (grease, NOT the adhesive) on it and it smoothed up."
1,"Be careful, this product does not do what it should.",The male cables will not insert completely. The best you can expect is mono sound. It is such a piece of junk it is not worth the effort to return it.
2,Mono and hard to connect,"When I first tried to plug this little guy in, it was so tight I had to ask someone with stronger hands than me to actually plug it in, as I could not get the cables connected. Once they were connected, I could not disconnect them without help.As several other reviewers have said, they allow for only one channel, which means when listening to music, I hear lots of background singers and almost no lead singers. I only paid a dollar, so it's hard to say it's not worth the price. But it definitely does not work for listening to music."
2,Plays One Channel Only :/,"I bought this along with an RCA female to 3.5mm male adapter so that I could hook my headphones up to my PS3 and play without bothering my cousin or mom.Unlike other reviewers, the jacks did fit into the coupler.But like other reviewers, I only got audio out of the left channel.The black plastic grip was also severely cracked and splitting when I received the item, but I can look past that, since it's only a problem of aesthetics.It serves its purpose, albeit poorly; I can play without disturbing the other occupants of my house. Maybe mine is just a defective unit; I'll probably buy another later and update this review when I do."
5,Does what it is supposed to do,Got this so's I could extend my Sony head phones (another good deal) and duel my ole buddy in Blazing Angels 1 & 2 and lemme tell ya got a set of these from Radio Shack and they were crummy...got these and they were at my door in a coupla days and work like a charm....now his wife doesn't holler so much when we go to shootin'
2,Some Assembly Required...,"When I received this coupler it was unable to accept a 3.5mm plug in either end because it had been poorly assembled. To get it working, I had to bend the internal contacts into the correct position with a needle. It now transmits the signal, but the enclosure is so flimsy and the internals are so badly secured that attached cords need to remain stationary or they will quickly fall out of the plug.I would not consider this item a long-term fix for any situation."
1,Only one channel works (mono),"I ordered this STEREO coupler as part of a solution I built to mount and connect my iPhone to my car stereo. Unfortunately, this unit, despite being billed as a stereo connector, was only working for the right channel. I replaced it with one from the local electronics store as it wasn't worth dealing with the return."
1,should have read the reviews first!,"Although the product sort of works, it's totally unreliable. You can't just plug in your cables naturally. You have to carefully position the cable inputs in order to get a solid connection. Then, you can't touch the coupler or you will disrupt the connection. The plugs will not stay connected. There is no ""click"" from plugging in; it just loosely holds the cables.One good thing is the unit is cheaply priced.I have contacted the seller about it. Let's see if a new, actual functional unit is shipped to me. Will update accordingly."
2,It works (barely),"It works after jiggling it around for 10 minutes to get both speakers to play, connection is very loose and random static every now and then. Bought a different one off amazon that is a lot better. I suggest staying away from this one and either buying a different one online or paying the extra few bucks to buy one locally."
1,How can you possibly mess up an item like this???,"I don't understand how something so simple could go so wrong. The problem with this device is that I wasn't able to fully plug anything 3.5mm into it. My headphones would only go halfway in. Same with the Gogrove. This should be a no-brainer. I could hear audio with it half-way plugged in, but they just fall out. I tried pushing very firmly, but nothing would fully enter the connector from either side. I had purchased 4 of these, but I'm returning all of them."
1,DEFECTIVE - LOOSE CONNECTION AND DOES NOT EVEN FULLY CLICK IN EITHER SIDE - NOT WORTH TAKING THE TIME TO RETURN!!!! BUYER BEWARE,DO NOT BUT ITEM HAS LOOSE FIT ON BOTH SIDES AND CONNECTIONS KEEP FALLING OUT; ONLY HALF OF EACH CONNECTION FITS ON EITHER SIDE; NOT EVEN WILLING TO TAKE THE TIME TO RETURN THE ITEM AS IT IS NOT WORTH THAT MUCH!
1,Doesn't work at all,"This product doesn't not work very well. Although it does its job, it doesn't do it very well. Made from cheap materials and the aux cable doesn't even stay correctly. I plugged it into my speakers and only the left side was playing, and if you shifted the cable around the sound would become distorted. Do not buy"
4,Just what I needed for,"extending my line. Very simple and great price-the price was 1/5 the price of the more prolific ""big box"" stores."
1,Only one channel!,"Only outputs sound for one channel of sound via a TRS 3.5mm plug found on theBelkin Bluetooth Car Hands-Free Kit for Apple iPod, Apple iPhone, BlackBerry,and Android Smartphones, US Version, a product that listed this as a ""Frequently Bought Together"" item. Be warned. Got one from radioshack for $6 that worked just fine. The 3.5 plug wouldn't insert far enough with this product for dual channel output."
2,"Good for DVD, bad for CD's","It has a lot of features and functions for the DVD player, but none as a CD player. The instruction booklet doesn't even mention the CD playing aspect of the machine. I guess this is understandable since the only thing it will do with CD's are play them one at a time in forward order. You can't program CD's to play one after another, you can't skip to a particular track, you can't skip backwards, etc. I had bought the 5-disc carousel so that I could continuously play CD's, but this player won't do that. It won't repeat a CD and you have to press play again to get the next CD to play. I'm returning this because I really wanted a full featured DVD and CD player. This is only a full featured DVD player."
4,Great Georges Delerue Soundtrack,"This movie deserves to be better-known, as does the soundtrack. Both have been recently re-released (DVD and CD)with historical documentation. The main title by Georges Delerue is particularly catchy, but there is other music on the CD to enjoy as well. My only regret is that the sound on the CD does not appear to have been remastered to 21st-century standards; hence the four-star rating."
5,very different,this was a sick but good novel the stuff people do to justify their wrongs is amazing. this book also shows you what goes around does have away of coming back around.
2,Interesting read,"Great book, looking forward to reading the next book. Things got interesting at the end, but leaves you wanting more."
3,Double Dippin,"Overall I liked the book, but there were some disturbing things going on in Double Dippin. I will eventually read the other books, but right now, I'm still trying to digest the 1st one."
4,WOW,"Wow. This book was definitely something different. At times it was a little too much and I felt like I couldn't handle it, but at the same time I was pulled into the story of Shane and Tariq. They went through sooooooo much and I think all they really needed was someone to be in their corner. Shane was something else. Just so conniving and had some dirty ways. Tariq was just an all around fool in love. I wish he would have grown a set of balls and put his wife in her place. The ending broke my heart. Totally unexpected. I wanted good things to start happening for them."
4,Crazy is as crazy does,"All I can say is mental sickness with doses of abuse that both boys suffered. Poor Ms. Holmes, smh....and we not gone mention just how outrageous Janelle got, are U 4'real girl? Misty & Brick...all these characters fit 2gether like hand in glove. This was an interesting flow of events, sad@ best. The love of a women no matter the form was yarned, no matter how bad or strange it satisfied their need and equated it as comfort.... LOVE. I may hafta give Big Juicy Lips a whirl just 2 see what becomes of Misty & Brick"
5,Very good read,"I think Allison Hobbs is one of the best writers out here - even though I have only read two of her books (Double Dippin and Dangerously in Love), those two books were the best stories I have ever read - they were so sick and cleaver. Double Dippin was a very good read, I couldn't put it down and I ended up going to bed at 4 in the morning because I wanted to finish this book. I must admit it was a little sick. At times I found myself screaming ""Oh My Gawd"", or just laughing out loud from the craziness I was reading. Not only were both brothers very sick, but the people they were dealing with on a regular were also sick. Allison Hobbs is the best for me and I can't wait until she comes out with her next book."
1,Double Dippin',"This book was bad it was not believable, and the ending was supid. I was very disappointed."
3,Double Twisted!,"Don't let the cover fool you, this book has nothing to do with sexy women and ice cream. Double Dippin' is a straight up TRIP! The story picks up when a set of twins, Shane and Tariq are subjected to life as foster children, after witnessing the death of their Mother. While Shane is described as the handsome boorish twin I found both of them to be equally demented, along with everyone else introduced in this story. While the book is a good read, it lacked climax. The pages of this novel are filled with raunchy, obscene, sickening events that the twins put people through or in Tariq's case, were subjected to. While I enjoyed Allison's attempt to keep us all intrigued with the lewd events that made up Double Dippin' it was lacking 'something'. The ending was a total shock, and was for sure the best part of the book. This was a slow read for me, and I times I felt guilty for reading it..LOL I give this book a 3.5, and I will pick up part 2 by Allison Hobbs, Big Juicy Lips."
4,Something is Missing,"I like this book a lot but at the end I felt like I was missing something. It was a great ride, but still. And I do not like the way schizophrenics were painted in this book with Shane ending up suffering from the disorder. Pretty much the last 50 pages or so of the book got really crazy and not in a good way. That whole deal with Janelle is senseless to me and a stretch. I just didn't like the ending. If anything the mental state of some side characters should have been explored more, Miz Holmes, Janelle, etc.Back to the ending: I felt the same way with the end of Gold Digger by this author. Although, I have my issues with her endings, I will continue to read her. This is a great book and should open people up to some things they may not have been able to explore.And this book wasn't that hot or shocking to me, but like said, an overall good read.I can't give half stars (3.5), so I went with 4."
5,Breast milk ain't for everybody,"This book was sick and twisted, but very good. Allison writes some sick sex stuff, but fortunately the storylines are intriguing enough to make you want to keep reading."
4,wanna a dip of crazy!,"this book was twisted beyond anything that I can conjure up. My heart went out to the twins for all that they had to endure in their short lives, but the oldest one was off da mf'g chain. This book falls into how being neglected as a baby can effect a person well into their adult years. The caretaker was just as sick as the oldest boy by allowing him to suck on her breasts as a way of calming him. The relationship was twisted and beyond bizarre.I felt bad for the youngest twin, he never had any control over his own life and loved his brother unconditionally. The twins had a love for one another that's touching. The chic that took advantage of the younger twin was also sick. i don't know when folks go believe that mental illness is real.Great job Allison!"
4,AWWW DAMN!!!!!!!! THAT'S A SHANE!!!!!!!!! 4.5 STARS,"THIS BOOK WAS VERY INTERESTING,SO MANY TWIST OF ABNORMAL BEHAVIOR (CRAZINESS)!!!! SHANE WAS TO THE LEFT WITH AGGRESSIVNESS,WHILE TARIQ WAS WAY TO THE LEFT WITH BEING SUBMISSIVE!!! EXCELLENT READ, THE AUTHOR DID A WONDERFUL JOB IN WRITING AND KEEPING THIS STORY INTRIGUING,COULDN'T PUT THE BOOK DOWN!!!!!!! I DIDN'T LIKE THE ENDING, BUT ABSOLUTLY LOVE THE STORY!!!!!!!!!!"
4,She speaks for the Crazies...!!!..!!!,"Ms. Hobbs loves writing about the Crazies, and I love her for it. She speaks about it and it makes us LOVE them. In this one we have Shane and Tariq. Shane was always labeled the bad one. But, in reality he just had some issues. Issues he never got to deal with that made him do some awful things. But, he was ohh soo fine and scrumpous while he was doing it..Through life he only had one love and that was his brother Tariq..When he got popped(arrested) they got seperated. Then the story flew From there...That Jenelle was one ugly BIATCH.. But, that's all I'll give away about the story....Pick it up..It's GrEEEAAATT...."
4,CRAZZZY!,"This book keeps you on the edge of your seat. It will keep you in suspense. Once again Allison Hobbs does not dissapoint.This book tests the bonds of love, as well as opens readers eyes to some disorders that really do exist. Although, this book was so sick, there were a couple of times I had to put it down. However, it was a very good book, and you have to hand it to the author to be able to even come up with a story on this level. Job well done, and I can't wait to see what else she has in store."
4,Okay,This book was an okay read. I liked her other books more. Its scary to think there are people who go through stuff like this. I'm still trying to think of which one was crazier - Shane or Janelle.
3,Its an ok book...Not A GREAT book.,"For me this book started off slow, and is a bit too unrealistic for me but however its read-able.. I wouldn't call it a page turner..the twisted story line is what keeps you interested because its a bit strange to say the least..I kept reading to see just how strange the story and characters would get and it did get VERY bizarre..but that alone does not make a great book in my opinion..which is why it is just an ok book to me.."
4,An excellent consumer unit.,"This is an excellent DVD player for the average person. It is easy to use, a snap to install, and plays DVD's well.It offers both analog and digital output so hooking it up to your surround sound receiver is a breeze. The optical out provides Dolby 5.1 output making the home theater sound you want from a dvd player.The only real drawback I've found is the fact that it doesn't play MP3s like many of the competing models. Adding that feature would round out this player and make it top of the line.Over all I'm very happy with the player and would recommend it to any of my friends or family."
3,It worked great ..... until................,"This DVD Player was great, a 5 star marvel until 3 days ago, and now it doesn't work at all. ""No Disc,"" it says, and the next thing you know, it's not a matter of a smudged disc, as I cleaned it. It's not a DVD-RW, it was the movie, Grosse Point Blank. Then the Big Lebowski. Then Independence Day, Face/Off, and the list grows. No warning, no signs, just suddenly, ""NO DISC.""I don't know what the life expectancy of a Sony DVD Player is, but I have to believe it is more than 18 months."
1,There are better ones out there,"Had this for some time now, and it is fine for retail DVDs and CDs, but you're going to run into a lot of trouble if you try to play CD-Rs, RWs, or anything non-retail for that matter.Not sure what company would make a DVD/CD player that can't play CD-Rs. A super-old Toshiba CD player that existed *before* CD-Rs were a reality played all of the CD-Rs I threw at it. Talk about a reverse step."
3,it was fine... before it broke,I've had this DVD player for a little over a year now. And before a few days ago I never had any problems with it. My only complaint back then was that the remote didn't have numbers on it making it somewhat difficult to do a few things. But that was only a minor problem. Now my player won't play more than a few seconds of any DVD. I'm lucky if I can even get to the menu. The player just sets itself back to standby mode. It does this with or without a DVD in it. I've had problems getting help from SONY. I used to love this player but now I'm seriously disappointed and looking at other brands for my soon to be new DVD player.
3,No Disc,"I think it lasted a couple of years, then all of the sudden. No disc. It can't seem to decide which format to choose. My portable Samsung is still kickin after lots of abuse. Looks like my next one won't be a Sony, I can't tolerate paying lots of money for a low quality hack."
5,dvd player,The dvd player arrived quickly and worked well. I have no complaints. Oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy.
2,More of a rant than a review,"Since it's practically impossible to find VHS tapes anymore, I finally broke down and got a DVD player. So this one was my second DVD player in a two month time period. At first, I bought a Phillips player, which worked on half of one movie and nothing else so I returned it and got a Sony, figuring Sony would be better. Well, this Sony player is better (hence the extra star)...it played a whopping 6 movies before it broke on me. (the insert area broke after a month and I had to pry it open with a paperclip) And the 6 showings weren't even that great. I had just bought Planet of the Apes and the player would always shut down at a particular spot of the movie and return to the beginning--I coldn't even fast forward through the movie. On one of my TV's the picture would always go from bright to dark, bright to dark.So this time I'm gonig to dish out the extra $$ and hopefully get a DVD player that works."
2,It was good while it lasted...,"This was my first DVD player, and it worked great, had great sound, easy setup, the Noise Reduction really cleaned up the image...(now you wonder why I am talking in the past sense)...but it stopped working after only two weeks and playing five movies. Whenever I inserted a disc it shut down or told me the disc was dirty. I'll be taking it back to the shop tomorrow, very disappointed with my first Sony DVD experience."
1,cannot play cd-r,"in spite of the perfect pictures, we are returning our unit to the store because sony has taken away the ability to play CR-r discs. you may think this is not important until you try to play that ""special mix tape"" from you grandson, or a short run commercial release by your favorite local band.of course this was not an oversight, as the biggest producer of commercial cd's, sony is trying to make it impossible for you to play anything except their product."
5,"""I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!!""","This book was excellent. Ms Ray did a wonderful job with this one. All the characters were fun and interesting, especially Brad. One minute he's a nice guy and the next, he's ready to rip someone's head off. The way he and Michelle interact with each other is special, and when she slapped the ""$%@*"" out of him....priceless!! Some of the dialogue between the two was hilarious. Alex, his sister Cassie, Michelle's brother Nick, Stan and Clint need stories of their own...that would be a hoot as well. I also enjoyed the short story at the end of the book. You're simply FAB Ms. Ray."
2,Not one of Ray's best,"Ooooh, boy this was a hard one to read. I like, in varying degrees, other books that I've read by Ray, but this one was a stinker. I just could not find the spark. The pacing was slow and it seemed like it took forever for anything to happen. Brad and Michelle never did develop into characters that were worth caring about or cheering for. I did, however, like the short story at the end. That was a winner."
5,WOW 4 releases of Have Gun-Will Travel in 11 months!,"CBS Paramount, THANK YOU for continuing the releases of Have Gun-Will Travel at a very fast pace.....this will complete season 5 and may I suggest you release season 6 in one set, as there are only 32 episodes... so the loyal fans can finally have all 6 seasons by spring! That is my wish for 2011...Paladin, you are the greatest!UPDATE: Very satisfied with this release, pristine for 1962"
5,Can't wait for the 6th Season,I am so glad that the final seasons are coming out. Yes they are greedy breaking it into part 1 and part 2 but so are many shows. I wish the price was less but to see Paladin again is worth it.
1,uh. NOT great for beginners,"I can see no way for a beginner to pick up this book and even understand what's going on. I have taken several years of Spanish, and I struggled through the entire second half of the book. This is an OK book if you are wanting to brush up on your Spanish verb tenses, but would be no help to someone who knows nothing yet about the Spanish language. I was also dissapointed about how the storyline was created. It was a bit inconsistant and also choppy."
4,Delivers as promised,"I purchased this product used because I had damaged my original copy of the cd. The product was in excellent condition. If you set a schedule to listen and complete the exercises, you will be amazed at your progress. it is possible to become ""conversational"" within a month. Give it a try!"
5,Hit the dance floor hard!,"Jocelyn rocks on this one! Very different versions of the song, but somehow they all compliment the original. She is, and always has been, one of my favorites. Actually, I had the pleasure of meeting her. Which of course made me like her even more. She is an excellent performer. These mixes are great, you won't stop dancing!"
4,Tight song,"I mainly listen to hip-hop and R&B but there is some good techno/dance musc out there, like this. This is a tight song, so check this out!"
3,"Nice, but covers to large an area","It's nice to listen to in the car (for a while, at least). It's pretty useless, though, since the geographical area is not limited enough. There might be a couple of those 60 animals in your area, but about 50 of 'em won't be. This should be a series of CD's: one for the northeast, one for the southwest....and so on."
5,What goes bump in the night,"If you live in the woods or country and are curious about what goes bump in the night, this book and CD will explain those noises. We kept hearing a wonderful creature but had no way to identify it. Turns out it was a screech owl (they don't hoot nor do they screech). This book has also helped identify several frogs & night birds. As a bonus, Lang has a very pleasant voice and the CD is well made."
4,Soothing and informative,"I love Lang Elliott's voice. It is very soothing and doesn't detract from the bird, reptile and insect sounds. I was able to identify a Horned Owl from the CD, so it is informative, too. The sounds are grouped on different tracks so it's easy to find the category you want, much better than a cassette tape."
5,Serene,This CD was awesome! I put the CD in and listen to it while siting on the porch in the evening and compare sounds. I was able to identify several night calls that I had previously wondered about. The narration and sounds were very serene to listen to. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves to listen to the night sounds around you.
2,Pretty funky cups - egg timer didn't buzz,The egg cups are pretty funky looking but kinda cool I guess if you like the plastic look. The egg timer ticked but didn't make any noise when it got to no time left which seems a little pointless.
3,Good and bad,Its a very good watch like the box but the thing i hate it i dont know how to open it form the back its really hard if anyone knows tell me (the bambi is really detailed good watch)
5,Cute yet Classy!,"My mom gave this to me as an early Christmas present, knowing I love Bambi and have had my eyes on it. Let me tell you, it's adorable! I love the vintage Bambi in the center and the links/flowers are so classy and elegant, even though it slides slightly down my thin wrists."
3,Pan size incorrect,"Not a 12 inch pan as labled. Inside diameter of frying pan actually measures 11 inches. Outside edges of pan diameter measures 11 3/8in. Lid measures 11 1/2 inches. Personally, I need every bit of 12 inches in a pan. Nice looking pan though. Seems durable."
4,Beyond True Stories,"This is the fourth True Stories texts I have used in class. Normally, I have one student read a story and get up and tell it in front of the class or in a small group of three or four. This has worked really well and students have been able to use the stories as a springboard for discussions. However, the stories in this book are two pages long, which means that I had to take another approach and have small groups of students retell the stories together. That's why I give this a four star rating instead of a five. My students have TOEIC scores in the 700s and above."
4,Admirable collection,"This is a curious and well done little collection of stories. The first story, ""Crockadile Tears"" is the best; it provides an interesting portrait of grief, or rather more of an anti-grief--I won't give any more than that away. There are a couple other gems in here, along with a couple competant but less profound works. Byatt is an interesting read."
5,Look up fantastic in your unabridged dictionary.,"Elementals is fantastic in all senses of the word. As a summer escape to places both sensuously real and richly imagined, I can't envision a better collection of stories. A literary treasure: buy it to revisit Byatt's glowing world and ponder her mystical yet human messages again and again"
4,Carmina instrumental for orch.,"Lovers of Carmina Burana will enjoy this CD because the themes and melodies are represented in another venue from what we are used to - and, if like me, know every note. A distinct pleasure."
3,Too small,Well made glove but the sizing is off. Hopefully after some use they'll stretch out some. I might try the med next.
4,great gloves for women,I thought I ordered men's gloves as no where in the description does it mention that these are women's gloves. Otherwise these are great gloves and I'm sure my wife will enjoy them.
2,Not perfect,"I bought it together with a similar brand, since I was going to keep one for me and give one out as a birthday present.Unfortunatly this pair came with some stitches missing so I had to mend them stright away. If I had been in the States and not abroad I would have returned them. Sorry Wells Lamont. The glove is good looking but the finishing..."
3,From Back Cover,"In 200 words describe your hottest fantasy...That's the sizzling premise behind the Fantasy Weekend Contest at the Hush Hotel in Manhattan. PR director Kit Prescott has outdone herself promoting a hotel catering to the senses - until she welcomes the first winner. Sexy, single Peter Garson has checked in to the Carnaby Suite - the same man who checked out prematurely from their wedding three years ago!Or your biggest mistake...Peter will do anything to win Kit back, including penning all his fantasies and feelings on paper for her to see - and experience nightly in the confines of his king-size bed. His touch brings so many memories - good and bad - flooding back. But can he and Kit separate fantasy from reality once the weekend is over?[From the Do Not Disturb series]"
4,Gross Out Monster,"This was our gift to our 4yr old because he's facinated with the human body. Very clever idea and all pull-out body parts are attached, so no chance of losing anything. it comes with three markers and surgical tools. He was thrilled with it for awhile, but my kids are notorious for becoming bored with an item to quickly."
5,LOVE!,"This was a cool thing when I was a kid and since my son loves it now. He loves monsters and since he was going to have a gross-out birthday, I thought this would be a perfect gift for him! It did come in an older box, but the product was in perfect condition. If you get this, know that waterproof markers also will work on him in case you lose your markers or they dry out."
3,Decent CD...,"Not a bad offering. Incredibly well mixed, great guitar sounds, and spectacular vocal harmonies on songs like ""free"" and ""Ray"" make this a band worth listening to. The biggest downfall: The need to rhyme every damn line of the lyrics. Tough to sing along to, as the lyrics are rather lame, but musically quite rockin'."
1,"Not completely derivative, but still damn unoriginal","The album that answers the musical question, ""What do you get when you cross the watered-down punk chords and vocals of the Offspring with the watered-down riffs of Stone Temple Pilots and the watered-down industrial beats and electronic sounds of Gravity Kills?"" The answer is ""Cinematic Superthug"" a watered-down, dull and derivative excuse for an album. Its not bad, mind you-- its actually rather harmless and unmemorable. This makes it perfect for alternative radio stations whose idea of alternative is Third Eye Blind or Orgy, two other harmless and unmemorable bands. High school kids everywhere should be eating this up with a spoon, and the fact that they're not tells me that the market is already glutted with this boring brand of 'music'. If you like any of the five above-mentioned bands, you could like this, though. I give it a full one star because five years ago, I too would have been eating this up with a spoon."
2,ambient,"best played very quietly , as background ambience when reading or cooking or decorating . Mild electronic stuff that drifts along without any surprises . They really should have stretched their collective imaginations and named the CD and the tracks"
4,the rest of the disc is pretty good too,"for weeks, track three was the anthem of my sleep - with its sweetly sad melody, omniscient, like stars, and the whole universe whispering behind -"
4,Did they remake Risky Business?,"It's interesting to me that Tangerine Dream and song 8:07 were mentioned in an earlier review because when I first heard 8:07/5:23, I thought they were tracks from Risky Business that I had not yet heard or remixes of ones that I had.Having said that, this is still a pretty good CD. I've always liked 14:31 and 4:14."
1,Overrated and not really ambient at all,"For the ambient purist, the majority of recordings described as such simply are not ambient. Unlike the original ambient records of Eno, which are designed to seep in and out of consciousness using their subtle textures and absence of beats, Global Communication's effort is typical of ambient as defined by kids who have grown up since the rise of house/rave music.The key failings of this album are (1) its textures are thick and unsubtle and (2) it is laden with beats. In short, it's too intrusive to be truly ambient - unlike Eno's 'On Land', Biosphere's 'Sunstrata', Thomas Koner's 'Nuuk' or John Foxx' 'Cathedral Oceans'.However, if you like the contradiction in terms that is ambient house, you'll probably think this is the best chill out album ever...but then you probably never heard any true ambient music..."
5,existential ambient music,"As said before, one of the greatest ambient albums ever made. Pritchard and Middleton are brillant. this is one of a handful of albums that changes reality. A couple of times I have listened to this album and forgot I was a human living on planet earth who had to go to work the next morning. This record can be that powerful.Course, some people might find this album boring and a great sleep aid. Pritchard and Middleton looking out for the insomniacs of the world. God Bless Em.All Joking aside, I say look for the beauty. There are few albums as beautiful as 76:14.end kdc"
5,Essential Glistening,"Enter a soundscape of epic proportions!At times chilled, others simply cool, this is a listening experience that stays with you long after it's finished playing."
5,The best unknown artist I know of,"Not many people have heard of these guys but they are truely a rare, hidden gem. They have put out a number of works under various names, but are best as Global Communication. This CD is an ambient masterpiece, still ahead of the crowd."
2,GROAN !!!!,"I was on a two-hour trip in an area with poor radio reception, with no other audio to listen to, so I was forced to finish ""Safe Harbor"". I actually fast-forwarded through parts of it because I could not stand the story's saccharine sentiments.The book was just plain silly on the whole. The characters were cardboard cutouts, many of their actions were ridiculous, and similar stories have been told in a better way by other authors.The only good thing about the book was its setting."
3,Good... but not memorable,"Having read all of Luanne Rice's books, Safe Harbor was not her best effort, in my opinion. There were times I found the storyline rather contrite, though it had some poignant, heartfelt moments. Plus the storyline overall had too many similarities to Firefly Beach, from which Safe Harbor was essentially a spin-off. If you want true vintage Luanne Rice, read ""Cloud Nine"" and ""Follow the Stars Home."""
2,Too sentimental...,"I find Luanne Rice's writing to be a bit too sentimental but have enjoyed some of her other books because the plots were interesting. The premise for ""Safe Harbor"" has potential but I'm finding the book is unable to draw me in. It is pages and pages and pages of emotions and feelings with little story. I'm bored and think I will be unable to finish reading the book, moving on to something else."
3,Predictable Romantic Novel,"The only reason I finished this silly book is because I thoughtMAYBE there might be a twist regarding the death of Lily andMark. I thought the whole book was dragged out and so predictable.I could have come up with this plot in my sleep. And what a cheesyway to wrap up a mysterious death, read the dead person's diary!! (Andstill find nothing too surprising) I bet this author and publisher is laughingall the way to the bank. This book went straight into thedumpster."
4,sisters daughters and moms relationships,"Just a lovely story, sisters, moms, dauthters and old friends. I just loved this book. I love Luanne Rice. She has become one of my favorite writers. I try to find all the books I can find by her. She just has a way of writing a romance novel. I love it."
3,It's An Okay Read...,"I liked this book, but it wasn't great. I do love the unusal way the two lead adult character's get together and it was nice to experience a patient, loving, and understanding male hero. The turmoil within the children was a nice change as well. In my opinion there were no real dynamics with this book, it slowly went along, ending in a good place.Once again, it was a nice read just nothing very exciting."
4,Good info on many modern crystals and gems but...,"...this book has a very Native American spirituality slant...also Paganism/Wicca oriented too, which is not necessarily a bad thing - it's just good to be aware of if you are not into that sort of thing - I am, so was pleased with this book. It has good info on more modern or newer crystals and gems than some of the other crystal books out there. It may not be the absolute best beginner's book and the writing lacked warmth (or something!) but it does has some useful and fascinating info on healing, correspondences and much from the author's personal experience as a Native American healer and (if I recall correctly) Wiccan high priestess. The crystal-and-moonlight healing water is one of the things that orignally caught my eye and the color pictures are beautiful and helpful."
3,Ok!..But not enough info. from an average book,"In this book i truly felt ""left out in the cold?""..maybe, but, it seems that the author left out a lot of info that seemed to be left out in the book that should have been in there. There were some great info on each stone..however, it left you wanting more but you just couldnt find it and just left you empty. Now as for ""American Indian medicine"" with stones i just couldnt see it anywhere close, and some of her info were misleading. Anyways, readers looking for healing within the stones should pick up a better book like ""Cunningham's Encyclopedia of Crystal, Gem, and Metal Magic"" which is the best so far you'll get tons of info from that book than this one."
1,crystal medicine,"I ordered the ""Crystal Medicine"" and I received ""Colored Sugar Water"" instead of my book. I sent the seller an email requesting the proper book and I have not yet heard from the seller. I suppose I will be forced to get a refund through Amazon's guarantee instead of relaying on the seller. I would never do business with this seller again I am just glad I deal with Amazon and their guarantee program so I know that I will not be riped off by the seller but Amazon will make it good."
5,A Real Page Turner,"With her gifted pen, Betsy Thomas takes us back to the time of homesteading in the Florida Panhandle. We live with Hank and Melissa in their little cabin, sharing their toil and pleasures in the everyday style of the era. We have no nextdoor neighbors, but family can be summoned by bell, or gunshot, in time of need. All the characters have individual personalities marked with virtues and weaknesses that make them real. The story line moves forward building interest page by page.Thus, with a setting carefully researched; characters that are true to life; and a story to tell, we have a book to enjoy from beginning to end."
4,Hot Rocket - High Quality,"Great CD! I've seen these guys live at least 10 times and it is a great show every time. The CD captures their energy and style effectively. The sound is huge coming out of these three guys. Works for dancing, driving in the car or adding a little rockabilly energy to your day."
4,Malignant Pied Pipers of our Time,This book was very interesting. A little insight into The Cult Leaders Of Our Time.
3,Folded funny,"I like this product, but the folds were in a weird place. Once I got it hung it was OK, though. Also, it came in two pieces, which surprised me, but worked out because I ended up hanging them side-by-side instead of one on top of the other."
5,Math,This poster is a great way for students to see everything I say in Math class. They also believe it more when all the things I say about a good math student are on a huge poster!
3,For modelers and historians,"This book provides, in the usual Osprey Battles format, a nice overview of the first great battle fought by the BEF in WWI. There are plenty of black and white photos, as well as color drawings featuring uniforms, armament, and so on.If you are a modeler, you could add Osprey's THE OLD CONTEMPTIBLES for a more complete vision of the BEF, and THE GERMAN ARMY 1914-1918 for an ""other-side-of-the-trenches"" view."
5,twenty five pounds,The advertisement for this product indicates that there is a container with the product in it. Imagine my suprise when I opened the shipment and found twenty five pounds of brewers yeast in a trash bag. How angry would you be. It is roughly four gallons. What do you have laying around your house big enough to fit four gallons of product in? Other than that the product works great!
3,Works Awesome!!!,"I purchased a 4# container of this for my dogs because fleas have been bad this year and the poison I had been using was not working.I didn't like using the chemicals in the first place, but whats the point if it doesn't work!?!?!?!?I seen results overnight!!! I used the summer dosage and by the next day there was almost no fleas left.Within 2 days there was none!!!!So -- when I reordered -- I am getting the BIG ONE!!!!I highly recommend this productUPDATE -- 11/28 -- I am thinking the 25# one I got is not the same as the 4# -- the picture shows the same, but I have to use quite a bit more of this product to get the same results I got with the 4#So now I have to order another 4# to mix with my bigger one to see if I can get it to work betterLike the previous review mentions -- this does not come with any Naturevet markings -- it is in a plastic garbage bag -- which would not be a problem if it was the same stuff as they have pictured"
2,Reggaeton Goes Wrong,"Este video es el tercero que tengo y la calidad del video es totalmente baja. Las canciones viejas para un video acabado de salir y el anuncio que dice ""uncensored sexy girls"" esta en la linea de anuncio engañoso. Espero que los productores tengan mejor conciencia la proxima vez e incuyan unos 10 segundos introduciendo a las chicas y 10 minutos mas produciendo el DVD, contenido y capitulos que es solo es una foto y play. Para ser la version 5 les falta mucho por aprender pero espero que no tomen este review ala mala solo trabajen mejor y sigan palante."
4,Larry Howard's Cornerstone Blues Jam Volume 1 Review,I was satisfied with this product. When I received this album the case was broken at the hinges and would not stay together but the disc itself was in great condition. I once owned the VHS cassette tape of this concert but it tore up and broke a long while ago. So I was excited to have something of it back in my media library. And what's even more is that this disc has a few songs on it that was not on the VHS tape. I miss watching the actual concert but considering that it isn't to be found anywhere on DVD this is a wonderful replacement.
4,WEIRD stuff,"When I first began reading this collection, I thought McLaughlin's writing was an acquired taste. But the further I got into his world, the more I understood and appreciated the in jokes and his use of the campy conventions of the movie genres he satirizes. Although these movies don't exist, they could, and probably not in too different a form from the way he writes them. Mutated animal-like forms play a role in many of the stories, and an apocalyptic ending is usually in order. I had to wonder constantly where I was in relation to McLaughlin's universe. Although his stories strike me as being somewhat context-free and lack a certain continuity, these qualities enhance the reader's feeling of disengagement with the ""real"" world, which might very well be requisite for entering his dark (although oddly humerous) landscapes."
2,Couldn't Finish It!,"I am greatly surprised by the positive reviews this book generated. It started off with an interesting premise, a girl from the wrong side of the tracks trying to rise to the top of the business world, but the novel sagged midway inexplicably. The suspense and interest for me stopped. The characters became dislikable. I found it hard to generate sympathy for pampered, whiny twenty something year-olds. Yes, Laura was treated unfairly by being stripped of her inheritance, but her and Clay reacted to this as if it were a major catastrophe. Clay is a spoiled brat while Laura is cold and uninteresting. Why Paul and Wex find this bland woman so fascinating is beyond me. It also became tiresome to read about the characters' outlandishly wealthy, privileged lives. They seemed to live a fake, superficial existence. The writing team of Judith Michael succeeded in doing only one thing with this novel. They made the lives of the rich and famous look incredibly shallow."
1,How could a movie with this fine cast be so horrendous?!?,"I was expecting a fine film, given the excellent cast and the sponsorship of so many European film groups. As it turned out, I finally found that the only way I could endure watching this film to its conclusion was by treating it as a comedy -- laughing at the unbelievably stilted dialog, the tacky costumes and sets, the population of Jutland and the English ""armies"" that consisted of no more than 30-40 people each, and just about every other aspect of this abysmal film. I am sure that there are more convincing productions by amateur theater groups, and there may even be better high school productions."
2,Low budget - not worth watching,"I love all of the actors in this movie... in their other movies. This movie looks as low budget as a PBS re-enactment documentary. In fact, I started to think that it was after the first 10 minutes of b-role and narration - and the actual actors being shown only in small vignettes. I'm thinking that this movie maybe was a chance for the actors to take paid vacations. You're better off watching the Mel Gibson version of Hamlet."
3,I Loved It... I Hated It...,"Shakespeare wrote a play which had a title that would be perfect for this film production. My personal feelings about the story, the Actors and the support team has a 50/50 point spread between Nirvana and Hell. The background ""chatter track"" was infuriating. The voices had dreadful British accents and the phrases were not appropriate for the time the story was set.The play I refer to above is: ""Much Ado About Nothing"""
1,Even Helen Mirren can't save this stinker.,"Imagine ""Hamlet"" with Shakespeare's lines removed and replaced by clunky dialogue, delivered by actors with almost no talent -- with the exception of the wonderful Helen Mirren, who is completely wasted here. Save your time and money, and watch one of the many fine versions of the real ""Hamlet"" -- the one written by Mr. Shakespeare."
3,Not Entirely Successful,"This spare film is based on an original version of the Hamlet story. The makers of this film clearly wanted to capture the stark nature of the story and probably the character of life in early Medieval Northern Europe. The actors are a really impressive cast and their performances are quite good. The film is impaired by its limited budget which somewhat degrades the efforts at historical realism. As other reviewers comment, the use of voiceover narration to carry the narrative is not successful. A very good idea but not well executed despite its first rate cast."
3,Hamlet - NOT,"This isn't Shakespeare's Hamlet, but a film based on the tale that became Hamlet. Many things are good - a young Hamlet (18-ish Christian Bale), young, vibrant, powerful warrior king (30-ish Byrne), extensive scenes in England showing Hamlet becoming a hero (all off-stage in the play). And it ends happily - yeah!On the downside, it's set in rough-and-ready 6th century Denmark, which isn't that pretty to look at. The staging seems static and lifeless and it takes forever to get going. Once Hamlet wakes up, things start moving along to a satisfying end.The premise - great actors doing an early Hamlet with age-appropriate casting - sounds great, but somehow it just doesn't deliver.I'll rent this video, rather than buy it."
1,Is this a parody?,"If it is, it's not even funny. Total disgrace to Handel's wonderful work. Peter Sellars thought this piece is just not good enough the way it was originally intended by Handel, so he decides to ""improve"" on it. If he had half the talent of Handel, he might have been able to pull it off. The picture you see and the music you hear have nothing to do with each other. Turn off your TV and just listen to the music, taht's the only way to enjoy it."
1,Another Bad Production,"Once again the great David Daniels makes a fool of himself by taking part in this vulgar version of Theodora (as he did in Rinaldo), and to make matters worse, it is sang in English. How can one set a Haendel's opera in the US (not America because America is a continent not a country, by the way)is beyond me. Operas by composers such as Haendel, Vivaldi, and Monteverdi must be performed in period costumes. The beauty of opera is not just the wonderful music but the production. DO NOT BUY THIS RUBBISH"
3,"Funny costumes, tasteless production with great singers","The large bottles in the background visually add very interesting elements to the stage. However, the costumes and the overall staging concept are dull and almost comical especially in the beginning. Nonetheless, David Daniels and Lorraine Hunt Lieberson are simply amazing in this production. I'm not that convinced by Dawn Upshaw's voice although her acting is excellent."
4,THEODORA WITH RESERVATIONS,"If you're looking for grand opera with pagentry and costumes showcased in period sets, this production is not for you. If you're looking for some of the finest singing in opera heaven, this DVD is for you. I'm in total disagreement with Sellers production concept, but those voices take control over everything so you can just close your eyes, or better yet, turn off the picture on your tv set and enjoy these opera voices at their finest."
5,Great disc title printer,I was having trouble with the disc labels getting caught in the dvd player. This is a pretty good alternative to labeling discs. The only thing I miss is the color and graphics that I was able to put on the labels. The machine works quite well and I would definately buy this again. Unfortunately I am having trouble locating additional printers. I hope that they did not discontiue making them.
5,"Casio CW-50, better than the rest","For the money, I would stick with the CW-50 rather than spend almost double for the CW-75 or CW-100. As far as I can tell, the only thing the 75 has is the onboard keyboard...I guess if you dont have a computer this would be good, and the CW 100 has the automatic turn feature, which is nice, but Ill turn the disc myself and save $50. The CW-50 prints to almost professional standards...and even though it says it can print on only 2 areas, it can actually print on all four sides of the disc, you just have to spend some time placing your images and disc correctly. For the money, this labler cant be beat."
3,Ribbon Purchase,"I haven't used this machine yet. But I have bad handwritten and anything is better than that. I got my at staples (cost $80) with a $20 mail in rebate, plus I had a business reward $30 discount rebate. So for $30 its much better than the avery labels that cost $10 and up.I'm written to let you know that you can buy the red, green, blue, silver, black, 3 pack of black ribbon at J & R. Single pack cost $6.99 plus tax and 3 pack cost $19.99."
1,Cheap Printer,"This printer is no frills and does a good job on smooth CDs, however it's printing on textured CDs is unacceptable. Because the product description does not tell you this I have no choice but to give it 1 star. I bought a stack of 100 blank CDs and also 50 blank DVDs (I have not received the DVDs yet and hope they are not textured) and the money I saved by getting this no frills printer has now been wasted.If it weren't for this downfall the printer would be deserving of 4 stars."
3,Depends on CD or DVD you are printing on.,"I gave this printer 3 stars because your results depend on the media you are printing on. If the media you are using is textured in anyway, forget about using this printer. The CD / DVD must be perfectly smooth. With a smooth CD / DVD, the results look pretty good. If you are used to the paper labels you print and stick on, the result can look a little industrial because, unless you change ribbons between printing lines, its all one color. But with smooth media the results are clear and don't easily come off. With a textured surface, the results are really bad. All of my DVDs have a textured surface (TDK is what I use the most). The results are horrible when the media has a textured surface and smooth combination, (imation DVDs are like this). Please look at your favorite media before you buy this printer, I wish I knew this before I bought it because I don't want to switch media just to print a label clearly."
4,Nice printer,"I bought this a week or so ago, it works nice. Text is clear, you will want to use larger fonts 26 or greater. I haven't tried graphics as I just wanted something to print on my DVD's/CD's without my sloppy writing. Only downfall, as is with all cheap printers, they get you on ribbons, some of the cheapest I've found were on here. And as this sells more, they will hopefully get cheaper. I printed appx 50 cd's/dvd's with one ribbon, and for the price of ribbons, thats less than 15 cents a pop."
5,Casio Printer Good Value,"This is a thermal printer. Basically it prints a label that you design onto a CD or DVD. If you burn a lot of discs and you don't know whats on them because you didnt label them this is great. The thermal print does not come off.However, if you have Windows Vista look for a unit that supports Vista, as Casio does not appear to have a Vista upgrade for this unit as of yet. Furthermore, they dont return requests on their site (email)."
2,Disappointing,"Not easy to set-up. White printable surface CD just doesn't work. Besides broken text printing, the ribbon leaves black smudges on the white surface. I can't find many gauzy surface CD type ready available in store to print on this machine. Most CD with some printing already on and slightly textured surface does not work at all."
4,Does what it is suppose to do.,"I had it for a week ($50 after rebate at J&R;)Printed about 30 disc so far.You will not get good result if the disc have logos on thepart you plan to print.The Memorex I use have lines where yousuppose to use your marker.I try to line up the text I print with the CW-50 soit does not print on these faint lines.I use NINA or MV Boli Font with Bold at as big size as possible.You can type in any number and not just the 48 or 72 pointsIt comes out pretty good, the low 200dpi does show up a little.The 8x TDK DVDRs are just perfect for this printer."
5,A neat way to label your cd's and dvd's!,With this printer you can eliminate writing (by hand) the contents on your cd's and dvd's. It's neat and precise and creates a professional image. You'll need to buy blank cd's and dvd's and the font is better when it is bold. The software is a no brainer and you can buy three ink cartridges for [cheap].
2,Beware the hidden cost,"I urge everyone to read N. Caine's review here. The printed discs look great, but this thing devours ink ribbons. Anyone who calls this an economical solution subscribes to a different theory of economics than I do.This is going back to the store. Maybe Lightscribe is the way to go??"
1,Didn't Like at all!,"Your CD's must have a smooth surface in order to print properly. If there are any ridges, bumps, lines, or lables on the CD it will not print properly at all. The box doesn't mention anything about the surface requirements.If you plan on printin on the top and bottom of the CD you must print on the top, then the drawer will open, and you have to rotate the CD and try to align it properly to print the bottom.When you do get it to print right the quality is marginal at best. Graphics are out of the question. They are horrible!I would not recomend this item at all!"
1,Very expensive for it's limited capabilities.,"This printer is overpriced and does the job at a high cost. If you want to spend $70, dig in your piggy bank and get $20 more for an Epson printer that makes quality printing on CD's.This thing is overpriced and it wastes 60% of the thermal tape. While I was using it I took the tape cartridges apart, rewound them and used them at least twice.If you have money to throw away on an overpriced poor quality device that will eat you up in printer ribbon buy it."
4,Analysis of Classics,"This book reverse engineers the structures in classic storybooks. By so doing it only presents the structures that are in those given books. It does not clearly define structures that you can use in your own books. For instance, the 3-part beginning, middle, end structure is traditional and explained well, but when it gives an example of a 2-part structure, it doesn't define or explain it well enough to use it other than in the way the classic book did. This is not a comprehensive book on picture book structure but it does give various examples that you can mimic in your own writing. It essentially breaks down the books into parts for easy understanding. There is enough variety to help you think creatively. The final part of the book simplifies the way to plan your own book and is useful for a beginner. What I gained the most out of was seeing the variety of structural combinations that some classics have used."
2,Nothing New Here,"Not really what I expected...same old, same old stuff.We don't know the cause we don't know the cure we don't know much...Why bother?"
4,The best from legendary salsa bandleader's early years.,"This compilation focuses on Tommy Olivencia's pre-1974 Inca Records' work. The late sonero Chamaco Ramirez is as funky as can be on the fiery dance hits""Trucutu"",""Debate"" ,""Fire Fire In The Wire Wire"" and ""El Titere"". Paquito Guzman excels on boleros such as ""Sin Compromiso"", ""Tus Mejores Horas"", ""Este Rencor"" and ""Pecador"". A nice retrospective of Olivencia's early works."
4,Deadwood = best B-side,"If you haven't already got the ""paranoid"" single, then go get it! Deadwood is the absolute BEST song I've EVER HEARD in MY LIFE!!! It's got that incredible rythm to make your adrenaline rush... It's a feel good about yourself song. It totally kicks a**... After glow is okay if you like the Garbage songs more on the glooooooooooooooooooomy side.. Personally I think it's ...toooo.............ssssssslowww. Still good though. Regardless, and Nevertheless, Deadwood is WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Definitley worth the money.,"This CD is great, with two previously unreleased songs (""Deadwood"" and ""Afterglow""), but the remix of ""I Think I'm Paranoid"" leaves much to be desired."
3,Philippe we hardly knew you,"This book sets out to right a great wrong. The Duke of Orleans comes across as a petty and, at times, annoying figure in the Memoirs of St Simon. Ms. Barker's work does much to make up for what St Simon has done in the past. However, the work is flawed by Ms Barker's use of Freudian psychology to explain the Duke's homosexuality. This is probably the only real flaw in this book, but it is sufficient to undermine an unqualified recommendation."
2,Still cashing in on tragedy,"Even worse than Hewitt's first (ghosted) book, Love and War stands out as one of the most insensitive tomes yet to publicise the private life of Diana Spencer. The writing style is self-congratulatory and amateurish, the author's point of view is erratic and much of the content is crashingly boring. Hewitt may have been in the best position to write about Diana, but wastes his last chance here."
1,A cheap attempt to make a quick dollar using Dianas name!!,"This is just a way to make some dollars. People may like to read gossip like this, but in my opinion just let her die in peace and not try to cash in..."
1,Much ado about nothing,"Just another cheap ode to a pair of dim-witted narcissists. Hewitt spends half of the boring book glorifying his Gulf War escapades and lamenting the loss of his military career out of admitted stupidity. Yet again, Diana was shown to be a scheming egomaniac with the morals of an alley cat. She should be left to rest in peace. Enough of the mindless adulation."
3,"Above Average with a Good Point, Generally Low Rent","I watched this movie tonight, and I must admit, I started it expecting to hate it, and instead found the patience to watch it to the end.It's a B movie at best, with limited script, acting cast, set sophistication. Certainly worthwhile as a source of reflections, but I'd like to see a much more skilled cinematography community spreading the Christian message.By the by, Revelation is not in the index, and the Gospel of St. Thomas continues to be community-oriented interpretation of God on Earth in community.Other movies that have been uplifting for me:BonhoefferGandhi (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)Tibet - Cry of the Snow LionThe Snow WalkerWhat the Bleep Do We Know!?"
4,The Revelation Trilogy,This second in the Apocalypse Trilogy is well-done and thoughtful. I enjoyed this view of the end of the world. I recommend it.
1,"Laughable, if it were not so sad","This is a horrible movie. The special effects are only special in that they are lousy. The acting is atrocious. The characters run around like puppets on a wire... at times I had the feeling I was seeing ""Thunderbirds"" all over again. The difference is though, that Thunderbirds had a much better plot most of the time.For non-religious people (like me), the movie is good for a few laughs. It gives a good insight into the twisted view some religious groups have of reality. On the other hand, it is actually a sad to see how the makers of this ""movie"" ridiculize their own belief by presenting it in such a dumbed-down fashion. Sometimes I thought I was seeing ""Armageddon for Dummies"" ... 6-year old dummies that is. The makers of ""Revelation"" did nobody a favor, believers and non-believers alike."
1,Revellation,This is another product that I did not purchase. I guess it got mixed up in space. Maybe someone else can rate this.
5,Life Changing!,"This is one movie that really has changed lives! It has also brought Cloud Ten Pictures to the forefront of the Christian film market. The writers have greatly answered most of the common questions and objections to God and the actors brought it to life with such power and emotion! One can not watch this movie without actually stopping to think ""Is this possible""! With a bit of research, the answer is YES! A must have for any and every Christian library and home!"
1,Bad acting!,I wasn't expecting much from this movie but man..... Poor producing very bad acting! Left Behind series was much better.
2,wrong product,"The wires do not fit the small marble cheese cutter that I have. There was not enough information about this product when I ordered it, so I had no choice but to send it back. I will not order another one on line again."
5,Very Satisfied,I was very satisfied with my purchase from amazon. I found exactly what I was looking for at a great price.
1,Didn't fit my marble cheese slicer,"The information about the product didn't give the length of the wires or mention that it only fit certain slicers. It gave the impression that these wires would fit any marble slicer looking like the picture. I should have returned them, but by the time I tried to do that the 30 day return period was past and I just lost my money."
5,Did the trick..,"We really were missing our cheese cutter when the wire broke and we were about to order a new marble slicer until we saw these replacement wires. We decided to order them thinking they may or may not fit our 30 year old trusty slicer. The wires arrived in just a few days, were a perfect fit and work just great ! Now we are happily cutting the cheese again."
1,Not very happy!!,"I was very disappointed in these wires!! There was no choice on any of the sites for a size~~all were listed as 4"" so I thought that was correct. However, when I got the order, the wires did not fit my slicer and were impossible to attach. The instructions showed several models of cheese slicers, but none were like mine!! The product only cost 3.95, but the shipping was $5.95 so not a good buy at all!!"
1,Please publish wire lengths,"After about fifteen years of great performance cutting great cheeses, my cutter's wire snapped. I strongly prefer to repair rather than replace -- in this case, an otherwise perfectly good remainder of a cheese cutter. Amazon did not list the length of these replacement wires; applicable cheese cutter model numbers were listed, however, but none was mine. So I eyeballed it. And I missed. Wires too short. I did not return the wires to Amazon because their low price didn't justify the bother. But there's the customer service consideration. Amazon's is splendid and is one of its most valuable assets. Publish the wire length, boys and girls. Yours are the kinds of customers who want to know. And we appreciate and value what you do for us. What would Mr. Bezos do?"
2,Item is too long.,The description in your add says the wires are 5 inches long. The wires I received are 5.75 inches long and are too long for my cheese slicer which takes 5 inch wires.
1,not made for all white marble cutting boards only for one unnamed brand.,"I would not recommend the product unless you have a small RSVP white marble cheese slicer that takes only a small 5 inch wire.the majority of cutting marble cutting boards I have seen are from a company called Prodyne. My unnamed white marble cutting boards takes closer to a 7 inch wire, which I did not measure until after the replacement wires arrived and they were way too short. I contacted the seller and they said no refunds for opened packages. I only found it was too short after I tried the wire."
5,Nice product,I bought this as a gift for my mom. It has been a year now and it is working great. She loved it! The item arrived very fast and in great shape!
3,Part of Dr. Oz's Tea Diet,This is part of Dr. Oz's Tea Diet. Works like a charm. I have lost inches already and I have been on it for 4 days.
5,Smells and tastes heavenly,"I really love this tea, the balance of lavendar and chamomile is perfect. It's very soothing. I found it at Safeway for $4 a box on sale. It is the best tea to enjoy just before bedtime."
2,Really Gross,"I've read lots of other reviews deeming this tea as ""coffee tasting"" or with ""roasted flavors,"" but to be very truthful, it tastes just the way I could imagine second hand smoke would. It's very very strong, requires 15 minutes to steep, and is not for the faint hearted. I've heard wonderful reviews related to weight loss regarding this product, but I was not able to tolerate the taste long enough to actually see any weight loss benefits. Good luck to those who care to brave this ""roasted"" flavor."
1,Not Ativa Dandelion tea,This is not the same as Ativa Dandelion tea. This one feels a little weird and honestly I don't suggest it.
1,NASTY,"This was the worst tasting tea, actually the worst tasting anything, that I have ever consumed. I took one sip and could not bring myself to finish the cup. It tasted like dirt, which makes sense since it is a root. The rest of the tea bags are going in the trash."
4,why did the company have to change this product?,"I used to love this product but when I ordered it recently I noticed it has been changed; it used to contain chamomile and lavender, two plants that go very well together. Now they've added lemon balm in it, I don't know why. In general I do not find that it's a good idea to mix too many plants in one teabag. Of course it depends on what you are mixing. Both chamomile and lavender have a very soothing effect. Lemon balm has other properties; it's not that lemon balm has negative properties but that's not what I want in my chamomile lavender tea. I wish companies would stop using dumb marketing tactics in order to sell products. Many products cause excessive acidity for example but nobody seems to think about what it is that they are mixing."
4,"Good overview, could have been better","I really enjoyed this book, overall. The only flaw I found in it was an erroneous statement regarding Buddhism and the Dalai Lama. The book states that Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama to be the 14th reincarnation of the Buddha. This is incorrect. They believe him to be the 14th reincarnation of Chenrezig, or Kuan Yin, the Bhudda of Compassion..not, as the book implies the reincarnation of ""The Buddha,"" or Sidhartha Gautama. The author seems to not have grasped the fact that there are many Buddha's, indeed that the basic Buddhist belief is that we are ALL potential Buddhas. Besides that, though, I did find the book to be thought-provoking and useful for anyone interested in exploring this subject, whether you are a beleiver in reincarnation or a skeptic."
1,I can't believe i bought this,Clearly i'm the idiot who needs an idiots guide for being suckered into such a remedial book.
2,Somewhat boring,"Austria is absolutely BEAUTIFUL and rich in culture and tradition. I found this video, however, to be dry and boring. Often they are showing you a person sitting and talking about something when they could/should be showing you scenery or pastries or inside the salt mines or museum or so many other things. And it tells nothing of what the people live on today - is it entirely a tourist place where everyone works in cafes or clothing or putting on balls?What I learned from this is that they have salt mines, and coffee is always paired with pastry, and that children are brought up learning ballroom dances and etiquette and manners. And that they have a strong appreciation of the cultural arts.Pretty much a swing and a miss for me."
4,2/3 great...,"I actually own the import cd-single which only features ""pyramid song"" and ""fast track,"" but i also own ""kinetic"" on the maxi cd single.""Fast Track"" interesting song out of all the b-sides from the ""amnesiac/kid a"" sessions it features some offtempo singing that increases and decreases its tempo alongside the bass and percussions. Its nice to hear, but not exactly great, but once you add up that it also includes ""Kinetic,"" this cd is woth it. This song is great, fairly electronic dealing in a gloomy atmosphere with great chanting.And of course, pyramid song, the great jazzy downbeat song with its amazing lyrics and incredible tune. This cd is worth it if you are a true fan, but if you are not really into Radiohead, you could be better off buying the Pyramid Song single that features 3 b-sides instead of this one. I still like it alot though-"
5,amazing. buy it. now. use credit.,"""so glad~ so glad~ your my~e~i~e~ine"" about sums it up. three fantastic non-album tracks soaking in that non-linear beautiful music arrising from the horrid pit and pith of modern capatalist society; the glorious milton-esque lucifer crying over the damage wrought. what's really striking is the range of material here in the very limited scope of four songs. everything from the majesterial, ethereal sweep of the ""pyramid song"" to the screaming laced up and lashing out guitars of ""trans-atlantic drawl."" perhaps it's just me, but the consistent quality of radiohead's singles and b-sides encourage this strange desire to own a copy of everything they've ever recorded . . ."
4,Another clue that Radiohead is just trying to frustrate us.,"It's a shame the band feels the need to shun such great music to the side for the sake of a ""concept."" Kinetic (throbbing bass, skittering drums) could definitely have filled the spot of Push/Pulk on Amnesiac. An excellent cousin to Amnesiac's warped yet traditional sound. Methinks that TransAtlantic Drawl may be the start of the next go round for the boys. Their Maxi singles always seem to telegraph the next stylistic move (see Pearly* and Meeting in the Aisle on the Airbag EP. Sounds a bit like Kid A's ""soundscapes"", huh?). Pick it up! And take a listen to Clinic (Internal Wrangler) if you really like TA Drawl!"
3,Radiohead is capable of so much better!!!,"I love Radiohead. I collect their Cds. My friends are all sick of hearing about them. Then, I heard Fast Track. Pyramid Song was great. Kinetic was brilliant. Fast Track was horrible. It starts out with some odd sounds and percussion, which was actually pretty good. Then enters this UNGODLY sampled noise that goes on through most of the song. At points, it quiets down and get distorted enough that it sounds decent, but then it comes back at full volume. You can hardly hear Thom song over it. This is one the most frustrating songs i've heard in my life. I'm giving this cd three stars for the other two, but the reason i haven't mentioned them is they're available on a different Pyramid Song single which includes two of Radiohead's best songs on it as well. Get the other one. ...well, someone had to say it."
4,Episodes on these Discs:,"This 2 DVD set includes 6 total shows of the Red Skelton Hour.DISC 1: 101 minShow 1: ""Better Than Dead Wed"" guest stars Alan Fun & Abby lane, 3 ""Canid Camera"", the ""Silent Spot"" and songs by Abby Lane including 'Strangers in the Night'.Show 2: a Color episode w/Red Skelton as ""Clem Kiddlehopper"", and Red tales the classic story of 'Camelot'.Show 3: a Color episode, John Wayne guests in skits, including ""Silent Spot"" skit.DISC 2: 107 minShow 1: Guests Martha Raye, ""Old West"" skit, ""School Boy"" skit.Show 2: Skits ""Cauliflower McPlugg"", ""Lord Beaver Head"", and Red visits with Ed Sullivan.Show 3: Skits ""Sadie"" and ""Freddy the Freeloader"", guest Everett Horton."
4,Missing dust jacket,"The book itself is fine and quite appropriate for my kindergartener, but I was a little disappointed that this brand new item purchased directly from Amazon.con was missing the dust jacket. I assumed that there should be one since the First Animal Encyclopedia and the First Human Body Encyclopedia by the same publisher each came in perfect condition with the appropriate dust jacket."
5,My granddaughter loves this series of books,"My 6-year-old granddaughter loves this series of books. When it's time to read to her, she brings out one of her DK encyclopedias. I read her about 16 pages at a time before she'll let me stop for the day. She loves the pictures and all the details included. At the end of each session she always says ""Gramma, I learned sooooo much today."" My response ""So did I."" I like these as much as she does. She got the Animal volume when she was 4. She loves to take nature walks, so the Nature volume came next. Every child should have these books. She has one of them in the car at all times."
4,meh....,This little Molex-to-3pin connector works fine. I bought two after I realized that they weren't included in the box of two 120mm fans I bought for additional cooling of my DELL PC tower. They work fine (and I have tons of unneeded Molex 4pin connectors coming from my aftermarket PSU (DELL itself provides no additional 3pin fan connectors because they aren't in the buisness of makin' it easy for us little people to modify their towers.)The only problem I have with this product is the price. For a small cable that is overkill! I've seen much cheaper stuff on [...].
1,don't buy any WIRES From Amazon,again i have to say DO NOT BUY WIRES OF ANY KIND FROM AMAZON !I have no clue wtf it is but so far NO WIRE/S HAVE YET TO WORK .
1,Must be crazy to buy at that price,Must be crazy to buy at that price seeing that you can get this adapter cable free when buying some fans.
4,Great Automotive Guide,"I found this book very helpful, being that I was looking for a repair guide for a 1977 Mercury Grand Marquis. You really have to buy it to appreciate it. It will save you a lot of time...not to mention money...and you will be very appreciative of it!"
1,"Quick read, but I want my time back.","I found this book entirely unlikable. The two main characters are hardly enjoyable to read about. Lacy, the implied ""hero"" of the tale, comes across as just plain creepy. In the beginning, Jasmine seems misguided and much too foolish for her age, but, by the end, seems like a paranoid lunatic who has completely lost her marbles! The other prominent character, Roland, is just a spineless pansy and only slightly respectable. I will be the first to admit that this book could have just been lost on me because I know nothing about Welsh mythology. However, if a writer is going to focus so much on obscure tales from far away lands, I feel he has an obligation to make his story easily accessible to the common reader. Final word: Disappointing."
4,A fine combination in hip hop.,"This LP album is a real good one in which seemed to be the first one I got of Jizzm High Definition. He's released earlier albums which are pretty good but this one was one good combined smash.Jizzm's got real good lyrical skills. On point and is quick on his lyrics. 2Mex, DJ Drez, Xolo Lan Cinco, DJ Casey, and other features in the album. Most of the productions were by J-Extro and DJ Cheapshot which, addin', real good production.It's now I'm noticing that Jizzm High Definition is starting to get more popularity noticing his collaborations with other hip hop artists from looking at his albums like Unlimited Edition, which is his latest.Peep it."
5,Great book.,In 1995 we found this book to match extremely well to the experiences we had on the island. It was much more helpful than two other guide books we had. We just got the 1996 edition to plan for another trip to the island and it is improved over the wonderful 1994 edition. We are buying 12 copies to send to our friends and family
2,Over priced junk,"I had high expectations for these gloves as I should have being I paid $50 for them! I thought I would finally have a glove that didnt fall apart after a little metal work. I dont use them all day or anything all I use them for is welding and metal shaping at home. Well after a few weeks of use the stiching just fell apart in more than one place! (mostly on my right pointer finger) I was also a it disappointed by the fit as well these gloves run very large, I ordered a medium and they still left a ton of room in the end of the finger and that is my normal size with other mechanics brand gloves. Anyway my recomendation is DONT BUY!! there are much better gloves out there for this price!"
1,not durable,"These gloves are very comfortable. They also seem durable, at first.I used these gloves for fabrication at work and after a week of use the stitching wore through and they started coming apart.I am very disappointed in these gloves.I think they should use kevlar thread for a more durable and longer lasting glove."
4,Fabricator Gloves,They are good for the most part. They have lasted longer than two weeks so far which is better than most gloves. Could use a little more reinforcement in the fingers.
1,Not a good fabricator glove....,"For the price of these gloves I would expect something that would last longer. It is a heavy duty glove, but not a good fabricators glove. These gloves lasted about 3 days of fabricating before the fingers blew out! I usually buy the cheapo harbor freight gloves which actually last longer. For the price I would have expected something that would last longer."
5,Great gloves!,"I went through two pairs of these on the deck of an aircraft carrier during a seven month deployment. Other guys were needing new gloves after just a week of use. If you are doing a job in a very extreme environment, these are the gloves for you. They fit well and are very durable."
4,Excellent Gloves,Purchased one pair as a gift and user was so satisfied I purchased a second pair. Recommend this glove for use in Farication and welding.
1,Does not moisturize hands,I tried these gloves for several nights. Each night I lathered with a moisturizer lotion and then put on the gloves- they did not work.The gloves are poorly made.
4,They do the job,"They are just as advertised. They are nothing exceptional, but they do the job. I'd buy them again. Good price."
1,Moisture Gloves,"These gloves are of low quality, the fabric is very thin and even though they fit my hand they won't stay on. I am returning them for credit and I have to pay the return postage."
3,Don't use them anymore,"It's all right and I don't use them anymore because I cannot sleep in them. When I am awake, my hands cannot stop working for a second."
5,Helping Hands,I use the gloves to moisturize my hand overnight and I already see a difference. I live in the desert and these are a Godsend!
1,terrible quality,I was very surprised to see them. Very thin. I needed them because I want to use them overnight when I put special moisturizer on my hands. They are just too thin....
1,Ripping and thin,"I received this item new. However, the stitches were already coming apart and the material is very thin. I've had much better moisture gloves for the same price."
1,No bang for my buck,"I bought these gloves because I urgently needed another pair of moisture gloves: the nice ones I got from Bath & Body Works (years ago, I'm sure for more than $6) were all gooky from my eczema hand cream (since my hands are the worst right now that they have ever been) and I needed another pair in the rotation. I could not find any moisture gloves in my local drugstore so I turned to Amazon, and based on the customer reviews, these seemed like a fairly good item for a fairly good price. I bought two pairs. They arrived quickly, but as soon as I put them on, I was utterly disappointed. They stretched out IMMEDIATELY. They have no stretch, no spandex. They actually FELL off my hands while I slept. I've been using moisture gloves for at least 15 years and they have never gotten so stretched out that they fell off during sleep. And for $6 a pop? Please. For $2 it might be a different story. Never again."
4,Worth Buying,"Jehovah never sleeps is a killer blues song! I have sung ""I Want to be like Jesus"" with the 4 year olds through 6th graders and they absolutely love it! -- definately worth the purchase!"
2,"Awkward dance moves, spend your money somewhere else","I own a lot of dance dvds, some of them are for striptease. I can't say how dissapointed I was when I watched this one. The dance moves are so awkward, the routines are more like regular dance routine with a dressed up girl. It's NOTHING like exotic striptease dancing."
4,great brassy samba disco,"This song is a giant, sexy celebration with a hot, sultry voice over the top of wild samba-house beats. Very entertaining. It feels like I'm in Rio but I'm in my stupid Saab on the freeway!"
2,as good as cheap...,"for the price, i think it was a very good buy if I compare to brazilian prices. Shrinked a little, but still fits on the mattress."
3,merlot king sheet set white,The sheets very wrinkley after beihg washed. If I put them on the bed right after taking them out the warm dryer they straighen out. They are not white white. They are kind of off white.
1,Uncomfortable,The material is very coarse which makes it extremely uncomfortable when sleeping. A thread count of at least 1200 would be a big improvement.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!,"This book is down right awful. The drawings in it could have been done by a 5 year old, and from what little I forced myself to read I've determined that the writing is somewhere around the 10'th grade level.. What is really bad about this book, is that after laying out a disclaimer that the author and publisher aren't responsible for your injury, you are told about a dozen different ways to very likely kill yourself. I am not kidding. The techniques in this book are extremely dangerous, and the pictures are misleading.Please do not buy this book. You will learn nothing you can't glean from watching a highlander movie or even 1 episode of the series. Literally. A total waste of money, and I am ashamed to have bought this utter garbage."
1,Don't waste the money,"Everything in this book is so basic, I might have gleaned useful information from it back in third grade. You could learn more from watching ""The Highlander"", or an Errol Flynn movie."
2,Not quite the quality I was expecting,"The cover to the book is very nice, but that is about as far as the quality goes. The hand drawn illustrations are of a 3rd grade quality, and to be honest, the writing is right there with it. I'm a bit disappointed to say the least."
1,Training Manual?,I only wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing this book. Don't waste your time or money on this one.There are much better books available on the subject.
2,Disappointing,"FIne as an additional training tool but no real substance- yes it tellls you how to practise slow motion drills but not how 2 actually put it into parctise. I wanted to no how to defend myslef, not how meditation could help my fighting. And you expect a 12 year old kid to carry around a bloody sword cane!Disappointing. Just disappointing"
3,Read Before Buying,"I can not believe this product ever sold for the ""original price"" of $160 dollars!!It is worth the $39.95 it is ""on sale"" for.It is very attractive and seemingly well made. However, be aware of the following.* it is not all silk but a polyester silk combination* The filling is stated to be at least 75% down, leaving 25% of ?* There is not much down in the comforter. It is more of a spring or fall comforter. Certainly, not a winter comforter for anyone in the northern states."
3,a narrow picture of identity in the Czech Republic,"Holy claims to be writing about the 'Czech nation' and thus very irresponsibly lumps Moravians into that grouping. This is my main complaint. As an anthropologist who has done fieldwork in the area, it seems elementary to make this distinction. Holy is Czech and this may be the best explanation for his neglect"
4,A Lot of Fun to Watch,"Topper Returns was so much fun! I loved the actors, the story line, and the mixture of comedy and mystery. Too bad they don't make movies like this anymore!Nancy Drew was fun, too; even my 17 year old daughter, who is a Nancy Drew book and game fan, enjoyed watching this B&W; movie. The only problem was that about half way through, there was some kind of problem with the film stopping and we had to rewind and fast forward to get it moving again. We removed the CD, cleaned it off, and reinserted, and it still hesitated a couple of times, but then cleared up and ran fine the rest of the way. Not sure what caused the problem, it could have been us, but in any event, we still enjoyed the story and wish there had been more Nancy Drew movies produced with these same actors back then."
5,NEWLY REMASTERED,Marengo Films is proud to announce the newly remastered issue of these two fine movies. We put both films through a complete sound design and color correction process. Our company guarantees these are the finest prints of these two movies on the market.
3,Topper Returns Not Colorized Version,"Contrary to the information on Amazon, the movies ARE NOT colorized. They are good quality black and white only. The only colorized version of Topper Returns appears to be the VHS tape by Video Treasures, which is in EP mode.Topper Returns/Nancy Drew Reporter"
3,Three Americans in Paris,"This brooding thriller is set in Paris played out by three Americans named Will, Pedro, and Jorie. Will abandons his Foreign Service post and returns to Paris to take up with an old lover named Pedro, who welcomes Will back after an absence of 7 years. The two then become involved with a diplomat's daughter, Jorie, who is mothering a Lebanese boy named Nico. When Nico is snatched away by a French Nationalist gang, the suspense begins. Finding the missing little boy becomes the main thrust of this story and from there on the story moves right along to its conclusion.The story is interesting enough and keeps you turning the pages to the end, but I wish the relationship between Will and Pedro had been developed more fully, and with more detail. I would recommend this book, because Gadol's writing is very smooth and the words just seem to flow off the pages. The ending was unexpected and a real surprise. All in all a good read."
2,"Read for Paris, not for characters","This book felt off-center all the way through, perhaps because the author let his theme (""moral drift in an increasingly chaotic world"") become more important than his characters. Pedro's relationship with his alleged longlost boyfriend Will is described in the sparest of terms, while other details like the weather, the architecture, and the politics of Paris are described at length. Because the characters go separate ways, many chapters contain only one of them and add to the feeling that the book is about two strangers who's lives barely intersect. Once the kidnapping occurs, the plot becomes a page-turner, providing drama in the form of the search and negotiations to get the boy back. Read this book for its characters' reserved and erudite descriptions of Parisian culture and the Foreign Service. Do not expect its characters to be compelling or complex."
3,Good stories but better detail in other books,"If you only want the surface details related to the stories covered then this is the book for you. There are several other titles out there that are much better reads and with much more detail, ""The Guts to Try"" and ""The Raid"" are just two.This book could have been so much better had the authors have chosen to cover the entire helicopter crew and not so much just the pilots. Crew Chief's and mechanics keep the birds in the air and they get no respect for it."
2,Better than nothing,"I ordered this light from another website. As a flashlight that you're pretty much guaranteed to have with you, it's better than nothing, but the LED is much dimmer than other lights I've owned. It's good for close up, like at your door, but almost useless for lighting your way across a dark yard."
4,Handy little light,It is small yet bright enough for looking for things in small places.Hooked on to camera for looking at the buttons in the dark.
4,Interesting.,"After years of Aikido training I reached the conclusion that Japanese cannot articulate their thoughts about KI simply because, in so doing, they would have to admit that all the KI ""stuff"" comes from China. Even in this book Tohei sensei talks about positive and negative energy because he eventually doesn't want to use the terms Yin and Yang. This having said, this book offers an interesting perspective about the body energy as it is envisioned by Japanese. Tohei sensei reportedly is a man with immense KI. He is the only Great Master who received the 10th dan from O Sensei M. Ueshiba.In conclusion, if you want a Japanese perspective on KI, buy it. If you are a beginner and want to get started on your inner energy cultivation, I strongly suggest you to buy ""Opening the Energy Gates of your Body"" By Kumar Frantzis. If you are experienced in this field ... well you already know what you want to do."
1,Horrible Techno Muzak with Beautiful Singing,"This is a Dr. Jeckal and Mr. Hyde CD. The singing is so incredibly beautiful but it's totally ruined with synthetic background ""music"". The drum machine parts are so bad it's like listening to a joke from Saturday Night Live."
3,A Delight for your ears,"Good soft classical music with a slight touch of modern electronic rithms. Perhaps not an outstanding piece of work, but for sure you'll enjoy a nice and peaceful piece of music."
4,Great intro to Zim,"A great sampler of Zim, including how he got to earth, introduction of all the key characters, and how it all started."
2,Misleading!!!,"My kids all love Invader Zim, so when I saw this 2 weeks ago, I preordered it. It is terribly misleading. I was under the impression that it was a new movie of some sort only to find out that it is just a bunch of different episodes from the series that my kids already have! I am really disappointed. But it won't go to waste. My older boys have the entire series in their room so the youngest is keeping this DVD for himself. So if you already own the series, don't waste your money!!"
5,Yes!,"I had never even heard of this show until my 13 year old daughter begged me to buy it. It was near her birthday, so naturally I agreed. When it came, I decided to see what all the fuss was about and watch it with her. Simply put, I loved it. (It turns out I had actually read some of Jhonen Vasquez's other works, like Johnny the Homicidal Maniac.) Now I am an Invader Zim fan, and encourage you all to buy it."
5,I love this show!,"After so many years of [rabid, undying] Invader Zim fandom, DVD sets and many, great many Gir-related merchandise selling as well as Zim sold candy in 'Door to Door', albeit through different methods and motives... Will they [finally] bring the series back?I don't know.To be honest, I would be content with even a spinoff series, even if it meant poop dog as the protagonist.To say there are a lot of [sick*] people out there yearning [sickly] for more [sick*] programs like this one would be an understatement, so why is Nickelodeon doing this? Raising our hopes up with this... are they going to [cruelly] break our [shriveled little black hearts] once more? Only time will answer these questions.*sick, codeword meaning wholesomely brilliant, brilliant beyond belief. Yes. Yes indeed."
5,Doomie doomie doomie dooooom,"Always loved this series. I heard about this video while reading about the fact they were releasing it to see if there was still interest in it for another season. There is most definitely interest! While the episodes on this are included on other DVDs, this is still most certainly a worth while purchase to send to someone who has never seen it before and to support another possible season of the show."
4,3ds Max 5 Fundamentals book review,"This is a superb book on Max 5. One of the major upgrade from 3ds Max 3,4 to Max 5 is the new functionality of radiosity engine/photon mapping in Max 5. a Kind of merger of Max and Lightscape. For this important subject along is worth of buying this book. If you need to learn about 3ds Max modeling,Texture mapping & animations,there are many good books out there. But for Max 5's new Radiosity Lighting feature(make your rendered images look very clean and photo-realistic),this book given an in-depth look on the subject of outdoor & indoor lighting. In 3d visualization, successful lighting of a scene is almost everything... one sees."
5,Totally gorgeous!,I love this piece. I have it in black and it's stunning! Great for displaying your favorite pieces. It was easy to assemble. I did it all by myself in about 30 minutes. Highly recommend this.
4,Good every day collar,This is a very good high quality collar. Very visible at a distance. My only criticism would be that I would like it to be a little wider. It is sometimes difficult to see with my Golden because of his fur.
4,Guadalcanal Lite,"Guadalcanal, an American Story, takes a different approach than many of the other books on the battles for the control of Guadalcanal. The author approaches the story, not as a historian describing names, dates, motives and inconsistencies in the records, but as a story teller. He focuses almost entirely on the land battles from the United States point of view, reserving descriptions of the air and sea fighting to its impact on the land forces. I enjoyed this book. The author's approach moves the narrative briskly. I learned new information about the battles that were lost in the detail of other works. The writing is solid and rarely degenerates into the ""US is great, the enemy is bad"" rant into which other books fall. I recommend this book."
3,Warmed-Over Meatloaf,"As an enthusiast of the Pacific campaign, I waited with great anticipation for the release of the book. What a disapointment! Although this work is interesting to read, it is flawed in that it draws heavily on secondary sources and repeats the same errors that have appeared over the years. Some primary sources are used but not enough to give this work four or five stars. Simply put, this is ""warmed-over meatloaf."" If you want an original, well-researched work, read Richard Frank's Guadalcanal or Michael Smith's Bloody Ridge."
5,"Had it for 5 years, still going strong","Fantastic keyboard. I love to type on it. I've been using it daily for over 5 years, and it's shown no signs of slowing down."
1,Defective DVD,"This disc never worked. I didn't bother returning it because I didn't want to pay to ship it back. I also found the same video for free online, and there was no new information on there. Perhaps it might be of use to someone who had no medical background, and was newly diagnosed, but I think it would be better to hand to family and friends who don't have the first clue about what PH is. The patient most likely knows what is on this disc."
5,Great SF short subject with a twist.,"This Sci Fi short subject is in the same vein as the Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits. Just when you think you know what's going on, it ends with a twist. I liked this DVD. I definitely recommend it to anyone who appreciates thought provoking Sci Fi."
1,Do Not Buy,"Pigface is purely a tool for Martin Atkins to name-drop other artists that are more successful than him while exploiting them for his own financial benefit. I doubt any one besides Martin Atkins has seen a penny from Pigface sales, do not buy anything from this guy, he is not worthy of your hard earned money."
3,Didn't live up to my expectations,"With Ogre (Ohgr), Trent Reznor, and Al Jorgenson being among the special guests on several of the songs, this CD did not live up to my expectations. I like experimental music, but I think you'd be better off getting some Coil, Current 93, Naked City, Lard, or Einsturzende Neubauten. IMHO. Maybe I'll like it better when I listen to it more, but I've had this CD for three months, and haven't wanted to put it in again."
1,More uber-xena,"If this hadn't been uber-xena, it would have been a decent, albeit pedestrian read. Adding the repetitive mantra of ""tall, dark-haired"" or ""short blond woman"" made this yet another nauseating uber-xena fantasy.The plot was uneven - some parts were confusing and others did not follow from the previous action, while the sub-plot with the ex-boyfriend was repetitive. He could have been used for so much more than just showing up and threatening Alex in front of witnesses.There was a glimmer of potential in this book, and if the author is willing to write something not uber-xena, her next books should be even better. Until then, avoid this unless you are an uber-xena fan."
1,"Disappointing, and not a flowing storyline","Much too long for the unbelievable storyline. Sequences are disturbing and distracting. Disappointing dialogue. I know this is her first novel, but this should be removed, reworked and possibly it will be readable. The way it is, I recommend you spend your money on Peggy J. Herring or Radclyffe. Season writers will give you a good flowing story. This one wasn't."
4,Gripping,"I debated for a while how to rate this book. I finally settled on 4 stars because of two issues I have with this book. 1) It was sometimes difficult to determine the passage of time between sections. You would think days had passed, just to find out it was only hours, or vice versa. 2) There were several unresolved problems at the end (sequel anyone? <g>)The medical scenes were gripping and so well written you felt like you were in the ER watching."
4,sent from above.,"with the release of ""lil' red boat"", angel grant adds her name to the current crop of artists responsible for returning the music industry to a place filled with talented individuals. jimmy jam and terry lewis' involvement is apparent, as the track sounds like a couple of janet's slower numbers (""again"", ""anytime anywhere""), but grant fills the sails with lyrics that are a little more introspective, a la des'ree. snippets from the other tracks on _the album_ show that ""lil' red boat"" may be singular in its lyrical depth but that the janet ballad feel is consitent. angel grant is unlikely to get a lot of airplay, which is a shame because her vocal ability is, at least, on par with jackson. however, this album is much more likely to have chanté moore shaking in her boots than erykah badu."
1,Wrong Title and Pic,"The star's idicated i.e. Ida Lupino, Robert Alda, Martha Vickers (also features Dolores Moran) are from the film ""The Man I Love""."
1,What?,"I didn't order this. It came in a separate package, on a separate day, from a separate shipper, from a company that I have NO knowledge of. The cable is useless."
1,Useless junk; not for use in car,"The cable cannot work in a car or anywhere where you need it to be protected from magnetic interference.If you want a cable that can connect your iPhone/iPod to your car, buy something else. This is worth 1 cent; not much more."
1,Uh...,"Bought from CablesToGo... they shipped a different cable than this, which is not at all a substitute for this product; it is not 6 feet, not 3.5mm, and not a m/m stereo audio cable. but it was black. so that's one out of four. so I'm not really sure how to review. Watch out for this store..."
1,Worth 1 cent,Cable arrived promptly but was unusable immediately out of the box. If the cable was not perfectly still it made horrible noises and crackling. Would not recommend these cables to anyone
1,cheap cable= cheap quality of sound,Used the cable for connecting my Ipod to my car stereo. A lot of static in the cable.The shipment was fast but the quality of the cable is terrible. Spend a few $ more and get a better quality cable. Music is enjoyed the most if the quality of the sound is good.
1,Stopped Working,"Like many of the other reviewers the cable worked fine for awhile, then the audio wasn't playing correctly, then not at all. I did like the long cable so that my teenager could control the iPod from the back seat, however it stopped working within a few weeks. I had bought 2 and had the same problem with both of them. I have since bought a cable from a different manufacturer and it works wonderfully. You get what you pay for."
5,Works great!!!,"It works great for me. I mean for it being a 2-5 dollar stereo cable it does the job. As with any cords of lesser value however, you have to remember not to bend the ends or connectors of it too much or it will short. I purchased more than 3 of these for friends, family and myself and we seem to love them and have no problems."
3,Not for iPads,"I bought this for my iPad, to connect my Bose speakers. It works but is loose at the iPad socket."
1,Poor Quality,"Worked well for 2 weeks, but started to have connection issues. Couldn't easily tell where the break was. but had to keep wiggling the wire and the connector for proper audio. Finally gave up and purchased another wire from Radio Shack - much better. This product is not worth the frustration."
1,Crap cable,This cable would cut in and out constantly and only after use for one week. I guess that's what I get for buying a $3 cable....
3,pc audio cable,The cost of the wire is 1 cent but the shipping is $3.00. Seller need to but a better approach to balance the price and shipping. Actual cost of shipping should be less than a $1. The real cable price is about $2.
1,they sucked,this was the worst thing i have bought on amazon. each cord lasted about 2 days they shorted out and after the thired day i could not use them at all
3,"meh, ya get what ya pay for...","well, for what i paid, it's just fine. i use it to connect my ipod to my car stereo and it works fine. the problem is that i have to kind of kink the cord or else it only plays out of the driver side speakers, which is irritating... and distracting while i drive"
2,scratchy quality,The sound quality gets scratchy if you move the cord. You can't move the cord too much
2,It Works... for a few weeks,"I got this to listen to my mp3 player through the car stereo. I just left it in the car and after a few weeks it got a short in it. It might do ok if it's not in the heat and moved around as much, but I'm pretty dissapointed. The good thing is it was only $5 down the drain."
4,Excellent price,"The price was extremely reasonable, it arrived in a timely manner, and it does exactly what I need it to do!"
2,"works fine, until it breaks from everyday use months later.","only get this if it's going to stay in one place, not bothered frequently. Easily damaged and rendered nonfunctional if tossed around too much or jerked in and out of ports too much."
4,Good Business,"nice, produce worked pretty well. Sound transfer is good, a lot different than what i'm used to but maybe it's the new stereo i Installed. either way, solid"
2,Not Reliable Enough,"I agree that this cable is not very durable, but if your auxiliary output is in a glove compartment or between seat storage this could be the perfect cable for you. This cable is small enough to fit in a speck (R) case, which does not allow for many auxiliary cords to fit in them. I found this cable to be lengthy enough for use in larger cars and reliable enough as long as it is stored correctly. Would definitely recommend this cable.EDIT. Turns out this cord stopped functioning after a few months use. I would certainly not recommend this product. Spend a few extra dollars and get a higher quality AUX cord."
2,terrible sound,this cable has terrible sound quality. The sound is garbled and staticy and the cord has to be adjusted to even hear any bass. Contacted the seller and was refunded.
1,Don't buy it!!!,I recently ordered these and was very disappointed with the sound quality. I contacted the seller concerning the problem and was ignored. It wasn't good to recieve a faulty product but the lack of communication and service was horrible. I wouldn't purchase this item from this seller.
4,Gooood,"Works great except when the cord is bent the wrong way which is kind of bothersome, but other than that, great heavy-duty deal!"
1,Noisy,"It picks up lots of RF noise.In the digital age where a cable either works or it doesn't, it's easy to forget that analog cables are different. Cheap analog cables sound bad. This one sounds awful."
2,Buyer Beware,"I ordered this cable and when I used it (instead of the other Radio Shack cable I own) it produced washed out, incomplete audio and constant hum from the subwoofer of my Klipsch IFI system. So it was 5 bucks down the tubes. Maybe it was a fluke. You be the judge."
4,Nice price but sound isn't the greatest,"I bought this to use my mp3 player in my new car. The first few times were great but now the sound breaks up a bit. I'm sure I could exchange it but I find that if I wiggle the cord around a little bit it works.For how occasionally I use the mp3 player, it's great!"
4,If you have an ipod and a car stereo with aux in you need this,well if you want to listen to ipod in your car without an fm transmitter.
1,Not a good place to buy from.,I will never buy anything from this company again. This was the worst deal I have ever tried to make. They never sent the product and never answered my emails about it. Amazon lets them get away with treating people like this and allows them to sell on their site. I hold Amazon as responsible as the seller. I will never buy another product from Amazon or go to their site until they stop and ban this seller from their site. i have been waiting on an answer from them. After this all emails and ads from Amazon will go to my spam. I have given them enough time to respond and they are much like this seller so I see why they allow this. Go to Ebay and you will not have this problem.
3,"Worth the Price, but...","This cable is worth the cheap price and its great that it has sturdy ends, but the quality does suffer for this."
2,Very cheap ... but it shows,"The company it came from and the shipping went great. I was pretty happy paying 2.92 for an Aux cable. However, after hooking it up and attempting to use it, I realize why it costs so little.I have constant issues with the sound cutting out on the right side of my car. I play with the cable and it starts back up just fine but it is quite frustrating. For the price I suppose I cannot complain too much but I won't make the mistake of buying a cheap cable again when I can get a Griffin cable and know it'll work great."
3,not what was expected,The cable is too bulky and thick. I got a different impression from the pictures. But it gets the job done.
4,Simple Cable,"Does what it needs to do, use it for in the car listening through my stereo from my phone."
1,Poor quality audio cable,"The Cables To Go 6ft 3.5mm M/M Stereo Audio Cable was delivered as promised, on time, and appeared to be in good shape. But the quality of the product is not good. The cable was purchased for use in connecting an MP3 player to the audio jack on a car stereo. After only a couple of weeks, the sound quality started to drop off. We wondered if the connection was bad, so we disconnected and reconnected the plug, but that didn't solve the problem. It turns out that the cable has a break somewhere inside the plastic coating and the only way to get the proper sound quality is to keep moving the cable until it gets to a position where the wires connect. The cable was cheap, so it's not worth trying to send it back and get a refund."
1,Pretty much useless after a couple weeks,"I bought this product and, like I said, it began to fail in just a few weeks, about three, I think. I use it to feed input into my computer. The sound goes into one end of this cable sounding clear and comes out like bad radio reception. The outside of the cable seems to be sturdy but clearly the wires, the part that matters, is not well constructed at all.It was cheap, and I use it to record radio static, so I don't really care, but ultimately this is a piece of junk."
1,Worked great for a couple of months...,"I bought it to use in my car for connecting my Zune to my car stereo. I was always careful with it, when I was done using it I coiled it up and placed it in my center console. After a couple of months of light use though, it would start playing only out of one speaker or the other, or maybe not either side. I jiggled it around until it made a connection so it would work. But the wires inside the cable were clearly damaged even though the outside of the cable seemed sturdy enough.On the plus side, it was only a few dollars so not much money down the drain. On the negative side, it was only a few dollars so I probably got what I paid for. I'm now buying a new cable (from a different manufacturer) to try again."
5,Product Review,"The cables are the ""best"" deal for the money. They work just as well as the cables you get from your local electronics store at a fraction of the cost!"
3,"does, its job, but why the high shipping cost?","I'm using this cable to string multiple stereos together, but it's pretty thin and therefore insulated poorly. I can't see it lasting long under much stress. Don't think I'll buy another one online again. I'm willing to walk into a store to get the ""most bang for my buck""credentials: A gamer, & a programmer."
5,A great purchase,"I was going on a long car ride and needed a way to listen to my iPod while in my sister's car. I don't have an input jack in my car, and I don't know if I'll have a need for it in the future, so didn't want to spend a lot. This cable was the right product at the right price. It worked great - good sound, sturdy cord, good length. I was very happy with this purchase."
2,Cheap cable is...cheap,"I use this cable to hook up my mp3 player to my car radio. It gets the job done but I have doubts on how long it will last. The cable tends to pop out when its slightly tugged on and it makes horrible crackling noises when hooked up to my blackberry(not an issue with other cables). Definitely a ""get what you pay for"" type of thing."
1,Absolutely useless,"This is the worst product!!! It cuts out every other second. I can't believe I wasted my money on this, although it was cheap. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,"Cheap and even postage-free, but there's a fatal ""catch.""","Most likely these will serve you well (I paid a pittance in addition to no postage costs) in most ""conventional"" applications. Unfortunately, my applications are apparently no more conventional than their possessor. I want a 3.5mm audio out from, for example, a Mac Air computer, from an I-Dog, from a pocket-sized iPod speaker, and none of these cables can hack it because the casing--the plastic ""wrapping"" at the base of the plug--widens too far to allow the plug complete and full access to the jack on the device serving as your sound source.All you can do is keep ordering more cables with 3.5mm plugs until you land one that's small enough to fit snugly in tight places. Since they're too inexpensive to bother returning, you're likely to accumulate a mile's worth of gratuitous cables before obtaining one that fits. At least the Scorsche retractable cable will fit into a few of the devices that are averse to most 3.5mm cables."
4,Review of NFLD Hiking Guide,"Descriptions and directions for each hike seem good. There are many maps, which are clear/helpful. Some info is a bit out of date. But, overall the book is very helpful."
2,Don't buy if looking primarily for GPS,"I am sending mine back despite the restocking fee. Word of advice: I made the mistake that even though I was primarily looking for a GPS device, I bought this- a PDA GPS, which ain't very smart. PDA GPS will hang, crash as they are not dedicated. Even if you would like to have a PDA but are looking for a good GPS first, buy a dedicated GOS device. I am not sure, how this product is good either as a GPS or a PDA if it hangs and crashes on you!Pros:Maps are good- just as rest of GarminGood battery life compared with other PDA GPSCons:Windows 2003- I thought it to be a boon, but was a curseHngs up- I am sending mine back despite restocking fee as it hangs up from time to time- in fact I missed important meeting relying on this piece of crapReception: I live in NYC, and it loses signal very frequently in manhattanSuction cup- Itz a hopeless cup and it keeps falling from the windscreen to the floor"
2,Don't bother,"I collect ""how-to"" books about BDSM, especially those which address female tops or slave training. This book was a Valentine's Day gift and I'll treasure it for that -- I just was not impressed with the book. There is nothing particularly wrong with the information (except for using pantyhose or ties for bondage -- don't do that) and there is nothing new here. The presentation with what I guess was an attempt at humor, only made the book seem like one a very vanilla person might put out to ""shock"" friends. It won't ""hurt"" you partner or you to read this, but please make sure you get another ""how-to"" book to double check the information; better yet, contact a nearby BDSM organization and learn about safety first hand. Some of you by like the black and white drawings of the book."
3,"Great book, very well written",This book is terrific. I have been searching for a good introductory resource that also stimulated some initial ideas for scenes and this book did both. After purchasing three other titles I found what I was looking for here. I hope there is a volume II in the future.
4,A fun way to let your lover know you're interested!,"Patricia Payne has written an excellent ice-breaker for the couple that has one partner that is interested in B/D/S/M. It's fun to read, fun to share and has just enough information to spark the creative juices!I gave it as a gift to my wife and it has enhanced our lovemaking and we often now venture into the world of B/D/S/M. I gave her this book to slightly prod her and it worked! But it is also just a fun book to read that has some entertaining sections and some cute illustrationsA good book for testing the waters of the world of Dominance and Submission. You're ""bound"" to enjoy it!"
5,"Charm, Humor and Grace in the Lifestyle.","As a personal friend of Miss Payne's, I'm pleased and proud of her literary work in this arena. There is enough information for new explorers of DsBDSM, and seasoned verterans. From Fetish to Kink and everything in between, it gives the reader confidence to journey into this realm. Fantastic job MissPayne!"
3,Sex Tips From A Dominatrix,"I found the book intersting and funny. I foundit mor funny than anything else, thauthor has a good sense of humor."
5,A good mando case,"I have been happy with this case. It is well designed to keep the mandolin secure, well padded and lined with appropriately soft material. After three years I have had no problems with it, despite some rough treatment. I like it and would buy it again."
1,Pedrini corkscrew fails,The corkscew shaft has separated from the handle and the corkscrew has failed under normal use opening a wine bottle.The product has a fatal flaw. Do not buy. How do I return a product when I am unable to find Pedrini in the U. S.?
3,Typical...,You can get one like this anywhere. Just got it for a friend since he's getting into wine.
3,Encouraging,"Basically the theme of this book is to be content to be a faithful ""behind the scenes"" person, pay your dues, and in God's time you will be promoted to increased visibility and responsibility. Nance uses the armor bearer analogy to make his point. Toward the end of the book, he uses a football team analogy as he compares various roles in the local church to the various positions of an NFL team.Personal experiences and principles from the Bible are used to make his point. He talks about the necessity of being excellent wherever one finds himself. Persistence is emphasized as is working as unto the Lord. This is an encouraging book."
3,"Runs small, not very flexible","I purchased these from Amazon when they were very inexpensive, otherwise I probably would have returned or exchanged them. They are nice shoes, unfortunately they run small and don't seem to have a flexible sole. My daughter will no longer wear them because she says that they are not comfortable."
2,Not the Dozen,"The Harvey Averne Dozen was recorded on the Fania label, and included some great tunes such as: You're No Good, Think It Over, My Dream, Wishing and Hoping, The Micro Mini, Shake Your Money Maker, and others. It was recorded way back in the Boogaloo days of the late 60's, so I guess it's out of publication. But that CD is a MUST HAVE if you are a collector, just fabulous music. This CD featured here is wearing the title, I guess to attract people who have heard that the Harvey Averne Dozen is one of the legendary CD's of the time. But this is not the real deal."
4,Lighthearted Actioner,"Most people think of Royal Canadian Mounted Police strories and films as being set in the 19th Century, rather like Canadian westerns. This is a solid 20th Century story, with Renfrew involved with cars, airplanes, and other things not normally associated with cklassic Mounties.The story involves Renfrew, an RCMP officer, who investigates a counterfeiting ring. The method for concealing the counterfeit money is clever, and some of the characters have a bit of depth.Renfrew is a Singing Mountie. Not all the time, but it maintains a tradition.The film is not a heavyweight, but it's a fun watch. Even after nearly 70 years, it goes down well."
4,It stays with you....,"Murder at Conundrum Creek was a quick, good read - or so I thought. But two weeks after finishing it, I still have those characters under my skin! Nicely written mystery with likeable characters."
5,excellant cd,we are very pleased with our purchase all our favorite songs by the dellswe on that cd how often does that happen.
3,BETTER THAN INSTANT .... BUT ....,"This ""Maxwell House Colombian Supreme Coffee, 33 oz"" can was certainly much better than any instant coffee and discernibly superior to some brands which have been found from time to time in our kitchen. Though we all prefer ""Yuban"" here, this 33 oz. can of 100% Colombian coffee has been on sale pretty steadily for about $5 in Kentuckiana over the past several months, making it hard to pass up.It is smooth, not bitter, but it seems to lack taste and body and seems weak, almost watery, though we make it in the same manner as the Yuban. I hope they stop running this product on sale so we can have excellent coffee again. In the meantime I will try to make the most of this bargain -- while it lasts."
1,A STAGE DIRECTOR'S MISCONCEPTION,"This is just so WRONG! Do yourself a favor; if you really like this opera go and buy the ARTHAUS MUSIC DVD with Gottlob Frick, Arlene Saunders and a wonderful cast and production. The current cast on this DVD can't hold a candle to that near perfect cast and production. Where do they come up with these outrageous concepts. A six foot sexually active bunny - come off it and have some respect for the composer and this beautiful score. AN ARTISTIC DISASTER!"
4,wonderful,"Of the two dvd/vhs productions currently available this is the one I prefer. The ""once upon at time"" setting, the excellent singing all make this an excellent experience. I think that the ""wolf glen"" scene is tough regardless of how it is done, I enjoyed this attempt very much. I wish it were available on DVD."
3,"Some strong hits, but mostly misses","I bought this album because the tracks ""Catch a Rude Awakening"" and ""Bring the Drama"" kept showing up on my Pandora playlist and rocking my face off. Unfortunately, the rest of the disc is pretty weak, and features far more diva vocals and cheesy acid-jazz vibes than I care for."
5,Very good cloth,"The color is a festive cranberry red, the design of holly leaves is intended for the Thanksgiving thru New Year holidays, but being single-color damask, there's no reason not to use it any time of year.I've had it long enough to wash it a couple of times now, and though some dye runs in the first washing (wash it by itself), I see no difference in the color of the cloth. Did not see shrinkage, either, and it comes out of the dryer pretty much without wrinkles, if you get it as soon as the dryer stops."
5,Nice quality,I purchased this tablecloth for a Christmas Open House and was very happy when it arrived. The material is very good looking with Holly as part of the pattern. I have washed it twice and it washes well. Very few wrinkles. I just wish this came without the holly pattern so I could order these tablecloths for other times of the year.
3,Brilliant but not so Bright,"I couldnt really understand it, as much as other people could. Had trouble with the words. It is not something that teenagers could relate well to unless you are African American."
1,I needed help,hi my name is alicia i am a high school senior and had to read this book i had to tell a summary and i could not how could i tell a summary of letters plays and her thoughts i needed help and if there is anyone out there reading it for school i would not recommend you read it at all its good but not that good to get a F for
1,"To Be Young, Gifted and Black was the worst book I have ever","I saw the ""Young"" part. I even saw the ""Black"" part. But ""Gifted""? My God! This was such a waste of time in my busy life. I can't believe I was subjected to read such boring nonsense. If you're thinking of reading this book, DO NOT. You would have more fun being dead."
4,"Young, gifted, and brilliant","I found this book in the library and fell in love with it instantly. The passages from Hansberry's plays and journal enteries were quite powerful- witty, yet moving. She truly had a gift for describing the human condition- AS IT IS, rather than how it ""should be."" However, I must admit to finding myself at a bit of a cultural disadvantage at times, as the author assumes that most readers will be familiar with African American lingo from the '50s. While some readers like myself may have difficulty understanding certain expressions, etc, the sharp overall messages and delightful writing style make this book both a learning experience and a pleasure to read. I hope others will gain as much from this book as I have."
4,"Touching, thoughtful and unique",A powerful look into the life of a courageous and brilliant young woman. Thought provoking.
5,GOOSE BUMPS!!!,"I wish I could give more than 5 stars. Fred Hammond has been a blessing in my life since I received Christ 5 years ago. He has a truly anointed gift from God above. I thank God for allowing his music to not only be a blessing to my ears but a tool of healing to my heart. I bought this CD the morning it hit stores and I think it's his best work thus far. My 4 year old son is already walking around the house playing it in his disc man singing the lyrics to 'IT JUST GETS SWEETER'. My favorite song is HE LIVES, it literally gives me goose bumps every time I hear it. God Bless you Fred!!!"
4,NICE RECORD...,"It sounds like Fred is getting in touch with his 'Inner Stevie' on some cuts. Its also nice to hear him getting back into the musical roots and move away from RFC and the 'praise and worship' style that he's become known for. Vocally he sounds rejuvenated and energized. This is probably some of his best lead singing since he left Commissioned. Not strained, melodic as ever, very relaxed but still confident. And true to form, the songwriting is rooted and ground in the Word. Very enjoyable CD."
3,It's growing on me...,"I usually have to listen to things more than once to find what I like. I didn't have the usual feeling of (THIS IS AWESOME!!!) about the entire CD as I did when I listened to Fred's other CDs. The music style is a departure (much more contemporary) compared to the last 2, but tracks like ""I Will Find A Way"" and ""Sweeter"" I feel will become new classics. ""I Will Find A Way"" is an awesome worship tune that reminds me of why Fred continues to be my favorite gospel artist. The vocals are dripping with fresh anointing and the lyrics will make you fall in love with Jesus all over again! If that's what you need too, this is a must-have to complete your Fred collection and to really get your praise and worship on!"
5,Heartfelt Worship,"Enjoyed every selection. The music will soothe you, but the words will minister to your heart & spirit. You'll want this in your collection."
5,"Fred Hammond Does It Again! (By: Editor, Detroit Gospel.com)","Fred Hammond is a legend in gospel music, and after 20 years his music remains fresh, relevant, and cutting edge. ""somethin''bout love"" is Fred doing what Fred does best: singing for all he's worth, writing contemporary gospel music that appeals to both young and old, playing a thumpin' bass line groove that keeps your head bobbin', and ministering through music to the glory of God. Fred Hammond fans will love this one and it's sure to be a hit with a whole new legion of folks who know great music when they hear it."
3,it was okay,"i wasn't all that impressed with this Cd. I like Fred Hammond and his music, but i thought the CD was about 5 or 6 tracks too long. Between track 7 (which is MY SONG btw) and the end of the CD, a lot of the songs sound a lot alike and i just seems to go on forever. I personally would have been happier with a single with ""Celebrate He Lives"" and ""Loved On Me"" on it rather than an hour of slow, emotional songs and only a few that i liked. but that's just me... if you're a big fan that worships every note that comes out of fred hammond's mouth, you might enjoy this CD. Otherwise, i'd take a listen before spending your money."
3,Good Stuff,"I looooove Fred Hammond! I'm very impressed with his musical ability. I didn't know he had the skills he has. I always considered him an excellent bassist but that's it. I now know that he can do pretty much anything and everything. This CD is quieter than the one before it. I would have liked him to do more uptempo stuff with his bass in the vein of-My,My, My God is Good which is an excellent jam. Anyway, I love Not Just What You Say. The lyrics to that song are really working on me. Fred is gifted-it was a nice touch to hear him work with my boy Marvin Winans. Go and buy this CD your collection will not be complete without it!"
3,Great worship music...but......,"I have enjoyed Fred Hammonds music for years and have all his music, he is an annointed praise and worship leader. The music on this cd is wonderful...however I was disappointed at the compromise in standards that he made by including secular singers. Other than that, the cd is his excellent and I would highly recommend."
2,Not his best work,"As a true gospel lover and long time Fred Hammond Fan, I found that ""Somethin 'Bout Love"" is just not Fred's best work. I prefer his work with Radical for Christ much better. Even his early solo work is better than this. It sounds as if he's trying too hard to be contemporary or ""cool"". Most of the songs are pretty boring and they all sound alike. I love Fred Hammond's work but I am really disappointed with this project. But, check it out for yourself."
3,Fred Hammond...low keyed.,"Great album, not his best. You can definitely enter into the presence of God with this album. This album is more laid back and quiet, a level lower than Purpose By Design. Waking up early in the morning this will be a great aid in starting your day. The three traditional tracks, that are only interludes, are the only time we hear the Fred we all love. ""Celebrate"" and ""Praise Belongs To You"" are more of the upbeat selections if you are looking for that. Stevie Wonder's ""Love's In Need"" featuring Musiq is a great track Fred and Musiq's voices go great together. All and all I gave a 3 out of 5. I wouldn't be shocked if Fred comes out with something else soon that will be a great follow up with louder tracks and includes RFC."
5,Love somethin' 'bout this disc!!!,"Wanna lift your spirits and focus on something besides yourself? Put this CD on! This CD moves the heart and lifts the spirit like few others I know. Not that I'm a connoisseur of Christian music by any means.Here are 7 good reasons to listen:Celebrate (He Lives) -- This whole disc is a celebration of G-d's love and mercy. This theme carries through the whole disc.Not Just What You Say -- Seriously, you gotta walk the walk.Lord We Need Your Love -- amenLoved On Me -- Seriously. The ultimate song for those days when you would rather eat nails than go to work.Love's In Need -- amenIt Just Gets Sweeter -- Praise you can dance to."
5,Soldout,"Once again it's on! Fred does it again, but he goes higher and higher. Somethin Bout Love is a beautiful array of love songs to God. The mixture of old school gospel interludes really assists in the transitions from praise to worship. This is an album that you can listen to everyday.*Lord we need your love with Pastor Marvin Winans and Brian McKnight is really a heart searching soul stirring medley that really makes you think.I really don't have enough space to really express my gratitude to Fred for hearing and following the voice of God by developing this album. It's on point and can rest in any atmosphere of cultural worship. Lives will never be the same after listening to this and allowing God to come in and do the rest. Thanks Fred!"
3,Hard to find,"This is a difficult product to find since this type of VCR is probably no longer made. This last Marketplace seller had an unforseeable hospital stay which caused a delay in delivery of this item. However, marketplace sellers need to be more honest and forthright about the condition of the items they are selling. This person was selling this particular item as 'like new' condition when in fact this item had a clearly visible dent on the top. It also was more worn than others I have purchased and the heads were never cleaned. This item should have been sold as 'used' because the condition was not 'like new'."
1,tracking problems after 90 day warranty expired,"I bought this cheap vcr in november, 05. It played great untill february 06. I used the VCR about 2 hours/day to play tapes. Around february 06, the playback sound became warped and a tracking band (about 1 to 2 inches high)appeared on the bottom of the screen. This happened for every single tape that I tried to play. The warranty on labor is 90 days for this VCR.Panasonic used to make excellent (expensive) VCR's. That time has passed. The only option to get a somewhat decent quality VCR is to buy a JVC with an extended warranty, as their reliabilty record has never been stellar."
3,"Pretty good VCR, BUT...","...No auto-tracking? What is up with that? What kind of idiot builds a VCR these days *without* auto-tracking??? These idiots, apparently. 'Nuff said."
2,Vcr is ok,Rewinds fast like promise but the head gets dirty too often I didn't have this problem with old JVC vcr what a jip don't buy this VCR get a Sony or a JVC they work and don't require so much upkeep gosh what a rip off .
3,Headache,I got eyestrain and a headache from watching tv through the vcr aswell as tapes made from it.Returned it for a Mitsubishi.
3,"Panasonic PV-V4524S--The good, the bad, and the ugly","The Good: Good remote, good looks, good record & play back on the same deck.The Bad: This VCR definitely has tracking problems when playing tapes recorded in other units. I tested using tapes recorded on three different VCRs--all where difficult (if not impossible) to track either on Auto or manually.The Ugly: FF/REW way too fast for watching TV shows and trying to FF through commercials. You just can't press the buttons fast enough to stop the tape at the beginning of a show. The unit just DOES NOT STOP ON A DIME. I found myself anticipating and pressing the button way in advance--2 to 5 minutes for long FFs, which it does very fast.Good luck..."
2,Bad Playback #2,"I bought this item because the price seemed right and I've own other Panasonic products that are excellent. I will basically confirm one of the other reviews for this product. The playback is bad, except for tapes recorded on this deck. This includes any professionally recorded studio home videos. There was a tracking line towards the bottom of the screen which would not go away even when using the tracking function. I wasn't too surprised that it did this with my personally recorded tapes, since they were recorded on an old 2-head VCR. However, when I played a few official studio tapes I was shocked that it displayed the same tracking line with all of them. Now, as the other reviewer pointed out, tapes recorded on this deck play perfectly.I have since returned this VCR and bought the Samsung VR8460. So far the Samsung works perfectly on all levels. All tapes play perfectly on this deck and it is only a few dollars more than the Panasonic."
5,Nice Magnet!,"Perfect with my kitchen decor! They work well, as a magnet should. I like them because they don't look ""cheap""."
5,Just what I needed,"Ahhhh, what an elegantly simple solution to the problem of grating cheese.The best part - it just works. Very easy to change the drums, holds up well to abuse, etc.The three different attachments work as advertised, and can go through the dishwasher, though if you are washing by hand there are more nooks and crannies than is convenient."
2,Good while it lasted,"This grater did an excellent job - while it lasted. Perhaps I got too aggresive with it, but the handle broke off after perhaps a year of use. Slower and more careful use probably could have avoided it, but I'm not exacly Mr. Muscles either. I expect better durability, but I give it two stars for the good job it does while intact."
3,Good While It Lasted,"We used this as our primary cheese grater for about year. Mainly it was used for cheddars but also saw a lot of mozzerella and parmesan. It was fairly easy to use and produced good results, but you did have to cut the cheese into pieces small enough to fit the grater (about 1"" by 2""). Unfortunately, after about a year the handle mechanism broke - this seems to be a fairly common occurence for people who use grater regularly."
3,"Did a good job, until handle broke","Used this grater ~3-4x/mo grating primarily mozz, parmes., swiss, & cheddar cheeses -- nothing heavy or out of line. Nice easy/comfortable-to-use design. But after 18mos the little rotating knob on the handle broke off while my wife was using it.Good well-designed item, but the next one will be a more-sturdy all-metal design."
3,"Does the job, but flimsy","This grater works pretty well, as long as you're not trying to grate anything hard (like parmesean cheese). It will grate ok, but makes it more like a powder. I'm pretty sure this is due the the fact that the handle flexes and lessens the pressure on the drum, and the small-holed drum doesn't carve deep enough.Not a bad buy, all things considered, but I'm sure there's better out there."
3,Editorial Comments from the Publisher,"Womantalk (Comedy/Drama) 3 females. Representational Sets. A play in three scenes.""The story of Woman's journey from the Dark Ages to New Life, with stops at the Garden of Eden, the grocery store, the gynecologist's office, and finally the Laundromat, where she receives independence, loving herself and God. This true and biting satire will always keep you guessing and finally leave you speechless. This ingenious playwright makes ""You've come a long way, baby,"" the understatement of the year. Wonderful multiple roles for all three actresses."""
1,Shouldn't the editor identify himself in a review?,I'm sure this is a good book but I'd like to see truth in advertising!
1,Very little use,"As noted in other reviews, grammar is not a major consideration for the NYS English CST. The reason NOT to buy this book is that the answers are WRONG for the sample test. I called XAM about this, but I did not get a phone call back. I e-mailed XAM about this but did not get an e-mail back. Not worth it. Just look up information and the time periods of literature, different kinds of literature, famous authors, and literary terms."
1,So Many Mistakes,"I would not recommend using this book to study for the CST. There are many, many typographical errors and other various mistakes in content. The practice test is flawed; many of the questions are given the wrong answer letter and the correct explanation for a different choice. Also, many of the answer explanations (as well as much of the study guide portion) is very vague, confusing, and contradictory. I wasted a lot of time trying to decipher everything."
2,"Massive theoretical and practical failure, but well worth browsing through","A massive failed attempt at systems theory. The approach has many similarities with Parsons's failed attempt to classify all aspects of society. When I say ""failed attempt"" I mean that the approaches have not been useful to advance our knowledge. Researchers and thinkers have neither followed Miller's nor Parsons's suggestions of how to do research. People into ""complexity theory"" ought to read this book, because I think that theory will go the same way as systems theory (i.e. the dustbin).There is however no doubt that a massive amount of work has been put into this book and that its author is intelligent. Two stars"
5,Rebecca Luker is wonderful,"I enjoy all of Rebecca Luker's albums, and this Aria series does not disappoint. It's soothing and relaxing, and her voice is, of course, lovely."
1,Not Worth Time or Money,"I've been using this book for three weeks, and find it a daily frustration. Code examples are generally absent. Key points for beginners are overlooked. And it's not like I'm a novice. I'm a self-taught MCSE, a Microsoft Certified Trainer with more than 20 years of teaching experience, and have been able to teach myself Visual Basic and other languages, but am tearing my hair out trying to learn Visual Interdev 6 using this book. A CD with examples of all code in the book would have been a great help.Here's a small example. Page 170 calls for you to add ActiveX combo boxes, text boxes, and command buttons to a simple sample app. But nowhere in my enterprise edition of VID 6 are they to be found! There are headaches like this at many key points and it's making my blood boil."
1,Don't waste your money,"I am a VB programmer and have read a lot of computer books in my time. This one is not only poorly written but many of the examples do not work. This alone is very frustrating and wastes a lot of time. I tried to read this book twice and have finally given up. Take my advise, buy another book to learn VI and ASP!"
1,Rush Job,"This book must have been written in a BIG rush. I bought it when Interdev 6 first came out, excited to learn this new tool. The basics were taught (barely), but most of the book was worthless - full of errors that render examples useless, incorrect information, and the like.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! I wound up buying the Dummies book on Interdev 6, and while it was excellent, I wound up having to pay for two books!"
2,Too many errors,"Some sample codes don't match what the authors have written in the book. A lot of erros in the codes. For example, in Day 13, the Authors even wrote a VBScript code like 'Dim I as integer' which is supported in VB only, not in VBScript. I doubt if the authors really tested some of the codes.This book does help me to learn VI6 but I don't feel it's a good book."
3,great book to start with,If you want to get familiar with rapid web application development using microsoft visual interdev 6.0 - this is the book for you.
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,I've never used InterDev 6 before and was counting on this book to bring me up to speed. You will be extremely frustrated with the examples in the book because NOT MANY OF THEM WORK! Where was the editor when this book was written???
4,Good stuff on scriplets and database access,"I was already familiar with Visual Interdev 6.0 when I read this book, but there were some areas I needed a refresher on, specially the data access and scriptlets sections, which are described in good detail and are easy to follow.I did notice a bug in one of the examples in an early chapter, but I have since checked the Sam's website and they've put out a fix."
1,Too General,I skiped the first 5 chapters of this book. The author gives very little examples. Always talk about the general functions in InterDev. Very frustrating and hard to follow.
2,Poor Editing,"I found there to be a fair amount of useful information, but being new to VID, I was extremely disappointed in the fact that so few of the examples worked as expected. Without a respectable amount of programming experience, one would probably not be able to make the adjustments necessary to get some scripting examples to work at all.Overall, a careless piece of work. I've come to expect this from Sam's. Wait for a Wrox publication."
1,Does more harm than good,I was very excited about the new version of Interdev and this was the first book I saw written. I should have followed my own and waited for the second or third. This book is poorly written and a good number of examples don't work. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND WAIT!!!!
1,Examples didn't work.,"I was very disappointed in this book. I spent a lot of time trying to get the examples to work only to discover through a lot of research, that they would never work."
1,He must have written it based on a beta version.,"I purchased this book and waited anxiously for it, but when I started to read it and work with some of the examples, I find that VERY FEW actually WORK. I am new to Visual InterDev, but NOT new to ASP, Databases, VBScript, SQL or JScript. A few of the examples in the book are helpful but that's rare. I would not recommend buying this book."
2,"Nice try, but...","Frustrating. There are a lot of good tips in how to use the Interdev product, but the book could use a good editing job. You're not sure at times when the author is attempting to run you through an example or just giving you general information. It's also frustrating because a number of areas that would be extremely useful to the developer (Server scriplets, DMTL scriptlets, and so forth) are either glossed over or poorly explained. Some areas of the book (the UI, where certain properties and options are found) are obviously based on betas of the InterDev 6 release which have subsequently changed. In short, a nice try but unless you;'re a total beginner on web development, look elsewhere."
1,Dazed and confused,"There's very little to recommend about this book. Most chapters are filled with superfluous verbiage and far fewer hands on exercises than I expected. Some of the chapters are redundant, as if the author forgot that he already covered this ground in an earlier chapter. There is no sensible progression to the book. Concepts and techniques seem to come out of left field with no explanation of the fundamentals of what's going on. You get some exposure to the VI interface and some familiarity with the construction of a site and programming elements, but a poor explanation of underlying concepts. I found bugs in some of the code samples, and few of the more advanced examples worked. Unfortunately, the chapter on debugging comes toward the end of the book. Don't bother with this one."
1,More harm than good!,"This book has been a real disappointment. It has caused more confusion with ambiguous statements and examples that do not work. It often gives code samples for working with SQL databases. I feel that most beginners would be using Access, not SQL. I was expecting more from a Sams publication and found great benefit in Sams Teach Yourself Visual Basic 4 in 21 days."
1,Redundant and scatter brained!,The book needs a much better flow. Some of the examples will not work as presented.
1,A lot of fluff without much substance,This book is written in a manner that is hard to follow. I often got the impression that the author was merely trying to fill up pages rather than convey a specific point. This may explain why there are very few good examples in this book. The author seems to love Microsoft and therefore objective opinions about Visual Interdev 6.0 are missing from this book. In short do not buy this book.
1,The worst book I've ever bought!,"This book is so bad, I'll never buy another book by this author again, and my confidence in Sams/Macmillan publishing is seriously shaken. Unfortunately, it was the first book on Interdev I bought. Many of the examples don't work at all - and now that I've learned from other books, I see that the author is utterly ignorant of basic concepts of using Interdev. I agree with the reviewer who wrote that this book does more harm than good, because it teaches many incorrect things, ignores some basics, and generally fails to accomplish anything. Not what I expect in a book I'm actually paying money for."
3,Good introduction to VI,"The first chapters are very usefull and well done but as soon as the content gets in more depth ( ASP, Design Time Controls) the book is not as good to convey these ideas and not all the sample code works. The author does write about testing our code but ...."
2,Some good ideas but lacking good examples,"The book is not without merit but could use fewer words and better examples. I found the first 5 or 6 chapters to be full of good information and ideas. But after a while I got tired of the author telling me what he was going to tell me about later instead of just walking me through it then. I've been programming ASP manually for over a year so a lot of it was review but some of it was good. When I finally got to the meat of the book, like other readers, I couldn't get the examples to work. I had the lastest downloads but they didn't work either. And there were no readme files or instructions with the latest example files, which contained bits of text, looked like part of an email. Guess I'll try another book."
2,Puppets and More,"This video has a mixture of music, puppets, and pictures to look at while the music is playing. This is my daughter's least favorite one. The Giant scene bothers her a little. She asked several questions about what happened to the giant. Probably better for smaller babies who wouldn't understand anything going on, on the video."
3,baby dvd,"This series trys to copy baby einstein dvd's. While it is very corny, my baby and 4yr. old are obsessed with it. I have bought more!"
5,With compelling first-person hunting narratives,"In Heartsblood: Hunting, Spirituality, And Wildness In America, author, editor, and wilderness expert David Peterson provides the reader with an informed, intensely personal, candid, and occasionally unsettling exploration on the subject of hunting in American culture. Petersen documents his observations with compelling first-person hunting narratives, as he also draws upon philosophy, evolutionary theory, biology, and scholarly studies on hunters and the ""hunting culture"". Hunting issues are as topical as today's newspaper headlines. Heartsblood is a welcome and very highly recommended contribution to familial, environmental, and political dialogues over the role of hunters and hunting in our lives, culture, and society for both good and ill."
5,Discover the world we were all born to live...,"I say with sincere passion and humility when I say that David Petersen is my favorite author of all time. No one, in my humble opinion, gives me the ride I seek in literature like Petersen. His ability to deliver critical conservation, evolutionary and spiritual messages in this current state of our world is beyond compare. He is fun, brilliant and spellbounds the spiritual seeker in all of those who seek ""the lessons that only nature can teach."""
5,Exposing the ethics of the hunter and the anti hunter,"There is not enough space in this review block to enlighten the uninformed as to what propells an ethical hunter. Suffice to say it is a passion...a love of the wild and things wild and finding a niche in this timeless chain for one's self. If you don't hunt, this book will help you understand why your dad or neighbour or uncle will waste countless hours in adverse freezing conditions in a deer stand or a duck blind. However, if you do hunt, this book is worth it just for the expose' of the roots of the ""Bambi"" syndrome and the unethical mechanisms used to discredit a heritage freedom and a nobel and ethical pursuit."
5,Thoughtful and Compelling,"I found this to be a thoughtful and compelling analysis of not only the issues involved hunting but in man's overall relationship with the environment. Petersen deftly cuts through the hyperbole surrounding the hunting debate and presents fascinating insights into the subject, often backed by personal experiences. Must reading for anyone involved in (or for that matter against) hunting."
2,A tough read,A great topic--the spirituality of hunting. A bit egotistical in approach. Only can read in short spirts.
2,Not what I expected,"Mr. Petersen spends far too much time lambasting ""slob hunters"" (who seem to be anyone that happens to hunt differently than him) and not enough time on the notion of a hunter's spirit. (see title of book) Some of his ""new age"" philosophical rantings are so far ""out there"" he may have been ""writing in tongues""...Instead of being an apologist for a sport he clearly enjoys, perhaps he could use his writing talents uniting hunters of different ""faiths"" (bows vs. crossbows vs. rifle vs. blackpowder etc). Maybe even write more about the vocal yet tiny fraction of Americans who actually oppose hunting under the premise animals are more important than their fellow humans. Through much of the book the author was more connected to said anti-hunters than with his fellow hunters."
3,Romantic,"The zahir is the ""one"" - your equal - your mate, your soulmate, the yin to your yang. I was struck by this romantic notion throughout the book."
1,Do not discourage from this writer,"I have yet to finish this book and I have owned it for about 2 years- i try to pick it up and finish it but i cant seem to do it. have read almost every book by this writer and love him! Sadly, this book I just couldnt get into and I am really sadden by that! I have read 11 minutes a few times already and some other of his novels a few times, but sadly this one just doesnt seem to grab me no matter how many times i try to return to the book. IF this is the first book you bought from the writer do not give up- his other books are WONDERFUL- my favorite is 11 minutes!! Enjoy!"
2,"Author's intentions of writing this book were not quite ""Zahir""","I love Paulo Coehlo's work.. with this book I got a bit impatient. sort of a drag in the middle. will still recommend it, because you always get something good out of his books."
4,his usual style,"I bought Zahir when it first launched and then put it on my book shelf. Two days back I suddenly picked it up to read and just finished reading it today. Unlike eleven minutes, this book is more like Paulo Coelho 's style. When you are in a miserable time especially in the relationship crisis or breakup, you will be inspired by Zahir. The search for self and broadening perspectives in life instead of being pity for self can always drive us to move on."
3,A Different Coelho,"I have read numerous books by Coelho. I kept reading his books because I loved them. However, Zahir is the only book (so far) by this authors I didn't enjoy. I expected the same emotional depth, search for oneself etc which are the hallmark of his books. Here the narrator appears as rather annoying/egocentric/shallow/superego character to which I had no sympathy. Plus, Coelho's style of writing seems to become much commercialized, and so different from the past; it is too arrogant at times. Overall I was disappointed."
1,Horrible! If I could rate this zero I would,"I didn't realize how much I disliked this book until 1/2 way through! I only read it because I'm in a reading club, never will I read any of his books again! I usually give my books away, this one will go in the trash! What a waste of time & trees!"
1,Disappointing ...to say the least!,"I am a great admirer of Coelho's other works but this one was an utter disappointment.There was nothing obsessive except the idea of obsessiveness. I became so bored that half way through the book I almost decided not to finish it. Reading ""11 Minutes"" after ""The Zahir"" will surely not only cheer you up, but also make you wonder if the author was the same one who wrote both novels."
2,Pretty Boring,"This book has flashes of brilliance but overall is pretty dull. It would be better if the author did not mention ""the Zahir"" about 10,000 times. This is the first book I have read by this author - I will try one more since he has alot of good reviews but this book just did not cut it for me."
3,Interesting Story,"The story is good, but I found it a bit clumsy, not flowing well. I just finished a good new novel:[...] It reminds me of Coehlo's work but less self involved and better written."
2,Worst book so far,"I'm a big Coelho fan, but this book was disapointing.To begin with, the first part is really dragging and you have to press hard to break through it. After that, you are witnessing the easy-to-read style that's so characteristic of Coelho's books. The plot is OK, but not exciting and many ideas are coming from other sources (the author gives credit to those people at the end of the book).The author is also bragging way too much about his accomplishments (the main character seems to be the author himself) to a point to which it gets irritating.The idea of Zahir in itself is fascinating and beautiful. It is the idea of love to the point of making it obsession (hence, 'A Nover of Obsession). And the author argues that everybody should experience a Zahir at least once in their lives. Can't argue with that!Overall, though his worst book so far..."
4,Inspirational,"I expected an action-packed novel, but got a spiritual journey of a middle aged man after his wife dissapears. The book is anti-climactic at times, but for all those that are spiritual and new-age religious, you will love it. The ending was a bit confusing and left you hanging for an explanation. But, I guess that's the effect Coelho intended."
1,"Don't, Good read but not Good!","Paulo Coelhho is one of the greatest writers of our time but he failed on this one and I wonder why, commercialism?Good read, but very disappointing conclusion that contradicts the entire story of what he aims to be plus an arrogant person that he states to dispel in this book, contradictions over. I am waiting for his next novel that will re-institute him as the best ...Alas don't buy this book, borrow it from the library and read it in your spare time, better entertainment watching Carnaval or Rome on HBO."
1,Failed attempt...,"This book was horrible. I have read a few of the author's other works and they were good. This attempt was a waste of time. I think the author just took the formula for all of his other books and applied it to this one.The writing is uncreative and straightforward (which can sometimes actually be a good thing). The plot is ludicrous and uninteresting. The characters are boring and difficult to become attached to. Midway through the book I really didn't care what was going to happen to any of them.Another thing about this book that confused me was the narrarator.Is it Paulo Coehlo? I assumed it was, but then when the narrarator kept talking about all the books he has sold and how everyone holds him in such high esteem I thought there was no way anyone would toot their own horn that way. Bizarre.The spirituality and metaphors are uncreative. Again, I'm sure that he just grabbed his tried and tested spirituality formula and plugged in some of the variables (location and names)."
3,Disappointingly Vague,"I have enjoyed other novels by Paulo Coelho and was eagerly anticipating this one. I'm sorry to say I was disappointed. The premise of the book seemed intriguing, and the story posed some interesting questions but the writing just never grabbed me and pulled me in. Turning page after page I kept thinking, there has to be more, but the story never delivers. The characters are boring and unlikeable, although it takes place all over the world you never get a good sense of the surroundings and on a spiritual level, the story never gives us that ""AHA"" moment. It was like anticipating the release of a movie and finding out it's better as a rental."
1,Coelho is overrated,"I know this might anger some people, but it is the truth. Lots of existential schmooz talk. To be honest, I could hardly sympathize with our narrator, and found myself happy with the relevation at the end...thinking ""serves him right."""
2,arrogant,"I agree with the previous review that the writing is excellent but this story just reeks of arrogance. The author leaves the plot at time to run tangents about what seem to be his own writing and interactions. These tangents are so self-righteous its ridiculous. All in all not nearly the best of Coelho. Quick, easy read though."
3,Cute...?,"The charm itself is cute, but small. But I expected it to be smaller (Description says 1 inch, keep in mind this includes the bail when it comes to this necklace). The bail on it however is kinda big, and unfortunately, it was not done correctly, because it is gapped at the point where it meets the fish like they didnt finish it. For the price of it, the chain should have been alot better, since the charm was so tiny. I ordered the 18 inch chain, and was sent the 16 inch chain. It was thin and extremely cheap. Would probably break quickly. Therefore, it is packaged right back up and will be returned."
5,Love this!!,I got this lotion last year for Christmas from my husband. I took it into the office and use it there daily. Everytime I use it I get comments from co-workers who love the smell. I like the lotion and I like the smell as well. If you like citrus scents you will like this.
2,"Disorganised, much like the first volume","Much like volume 1 of this series, this book seems to be more rambling than lesson, but has information within it nonetheless. The diagrams are clear, and the writing unmarred by grammatical errors. Nonetheless, the challenge this book poses the reader is not entirely in the difficulty of the topic, but also can be blamed on the carelessness of the author. While the book forms a valuable shortening of the topics needed to comprehend ATM when compared to the White Papers, one longs for a more graceful explanation than U. Black offers."
1,bad video,"the so called expert in this video talks about swinging down on the ball,if you watch the pro's you can see that they are clearly not swinging down and the presentation of the whole video is very poorly done,the drills he gives you are useful but his explaination to each of them is not given clearly...out of this video he gives one good tip which is stand back in the batters box if the pitcher is fast.Do yourself a favor and skip this video."
2,Noisy,"I agree with previous review - no way is this quiet. Fans make way too much noise and with both going the chassis rattle and vibrates.We've used it twice and its too noisy ,we're pulling it out and looking for a quieter one."
1,Noisy whole house fan,"Easy to install except after installation, cover kept opening and closing when it was turned off. Company suggested replacing the whole fan, but I was able to adjust the limit switch after some time.Company does not honor warranty unless purchased from an approved dealer.This fan is relatively noisy. If having a chainsaw in your bedroom running at high speed doesn't bother you, then this should be OK. Otherwise, I would suggest hearing protection or another fan."
2,Much too noisy,"The installation of this is pretty easy. The unit comes with a nice video that shows the basics of the install.The fan seems to move enough air but the fan is much too noisy. If your anywhere near the unit you cannot have a conversation without having to yell. Even on low the unit is very loud. The fan comes with a high and low setting but low means 1 fan at high speed, high mean both fans at high speed.Also the remote seems to have very limited range, I pretty much have to stand under it for it to work."
2,Very loud whole house fan,"This should not be advertised as quiet. The small diameter high rpm fans make it extremely loud.Other than that, it works as advertised.Because of the noise, I am replacing mine with something quieter."
3,Didn't notice an improvement in the way I feel.,I took the bottle as described and just didn't feel any different. Maybe I need to take it longer but I don't want to waste my money on something that isn't going to do anything beneficial for me.
2,Good quality DVD damaged by included commercial ads,"This was an excellent series presented on PBS, and I was very pleased with the quality of the DVD set, but was disappointed that these DVDs require the viewer to watch tacky Traveler's Insurance advertisements.The DVD is coded so that one cannot pass the ads -- you will be forced to watch the commercials and I felt that this was (1) insulting, since I paid for the DVD, and (2) rather cheapened the viewing experience.That said, I would have given the set four stars for overall dramatic presentation and theatrical beauty."
5,Unbelievable,"Gratefully, I read the reviews and bought this set. It is magnificent!!! The acting is superb, the scenery is amazing and the history is painful. Great mystery, great music, one of the best."
3,alternative to dumbed down T V programming,"While we are Foyle's War and Midsomer Murder fans, this was a passable alternative for us (since we've nearly run out of those). It is well done and the acting is good. If you enjoy Foyle's War and Midsomer Murders, the Miss Marple mysteries and an occastional Poirot, this will interest you. I can't say it is up there in our estimation with Foyle or Midsomer, but we enjoyed it and will probably order more in the series."
3,"pretty good, moderate disappointment","fascinating period piece in many ways, but blundering police chief and many others become cartoon characters of mindless racist, arrogance,Maybe many were indeed like that as they were portrayed in ""Black and white in color"" the feature film;Certainly, not up to the quality of Coup de Torchon by any meansAll three have a craven and very annoying ad for Travelers Insurance Company at the beginning of each one which stinks for a product one buys. I wonder how much WGBH got for including that."
3,Who Done It?,"Heat of the Sun Boxed Set (Private Lives / Hide in Plain Sight / The Sport of Kings)15 Jan 12Received the 3-disk set yesterday. All was fine until the final disk which does not include the ending to this ""Mystery"" series. That is, Diana Rigg comes on BEFORE the death of van der Hurst is investigated and solved, and the ""romance"" between Tyburn and Fitzgerald takes shape--as seen on PBS in the late 90's.Why is there no 4th disk with the ultimate conclusions?M. Cummings"
3,"Pretty Settings, Awful Scripts","Disappointing series due to creaky plots which rely on shock rather than wit, e.g. star Eve is in Africa because he killed a wealthy homosexual pedophile. We see him shoot the man on two separate occasions in episode one and each time star Eve is framed and lit as some sort of mythical avenging angel. Later, star Eve must deal with a rouged, fey, coke sniffing homosexual who makes Michael Jackson look understated. Really, this kind of thing is not what one expects of an expensive-looking British production. If I wanted this kind of pap I could have rented a Chuck Norris or Steven Seagal film. And star Eve packs his noticeable pudge a little too tightly into his costumes for him to be believably tossing interlopers around as if he were, well, Chuck Norris or Steven Seagal. So, watch if you want some nice views of Africa - or if you are a touch homophobic - but don't expect anything sophisticated or even well done."
4,Excellent set,"I purchased this set when Amazon had it for $75 - The cues alone were well worth that. As the previous review stated, the 2 piece titanium cues are excellent. Great balance and feel. The cast resin balls are also very nice. I like the fact that the color and numbers are cast in the balls, not screened on the balls. If looks are more important, the screened balls have straighter lines and brighter colors, but the cast resin balls are stronger and play great. The rest of the set is adequate. The entire thing makes a perfect better-than-beginner starter set."
5,very good,"I bought this and was very surprised by it. the quality is definitely good enough not to desire something else. the cue sticks rock, I had no idea there were cue's that slid so well without putting chalk on your hands. loved this set. the cues alone made it worth it."
1,piece of junk,"Balls wax layer is too thin, easy to be scratched. Table brush leaves more dust when you brush the table. Cues' pads are so hard and thin, very slippery when they hit a ball. Spent just a few more dollars and buy descent products. This set is a piece of junk."
4,Overall Good,"Overall, a good book with good ideas for getaways. Provides 2-3 day excursions, usually themed according to either environment or activities. For instance, there's the predictable Zoo/Wild Animal Park adventure, but it also gives good ideas for trips into the mountains or desert, or even a horseback themed trip. I think the ideal couple who would enjoy this is those who are near enough to make frequent trips to San Diego, but don't necessarily live here (i.e. LA). Even though I live here, I think it will be good to get away for a few of these.I try to make the most of this city (easy to do since we love it so much!), and this book has some good items that I wasn't aware of, particularly outside the typical San Diego/Coronado/Carlsbad descriptions found in many travel books.For an overall sightseeing guide, one would do better with Fodor's or Fromme's, but this book has some good expanded-area info, as well as some ""preassembled"" trips, complete with lodging recommendations."
5,Very pleased,"The posters arrived in a timely manner. They were also exactly as I had hoped they would be. After placing them on my classroom wall, my students noticed them right away and started imitating the gestures and saying the syllables."
3,Good information - poor quality photos,"While I found this book to have very nice information that was well organized, the photos and the overall layout and design of the book left something to be desired. For a pictoral guide, the photos were very small, many appeared to have been scanned in at a less than adequate resolution and it was poorly laid out design-wise. Being a primatologist and a graphic designer, I praise the information presented, but think the photos are a disappointment. Also a bit overpriced I might add."
3,"Good if you are studying primates, not for the average layman","If you are keen to study primates or currently studying primates, then this will make an excellent reference guide. However, the images and font size can be rather small and the layout is not fantastic. Rather technical in nature and relatively high use of scientic terms which can make reading a chore if you are reading merely for interest. Will recommend this only if you are a hardcore student of primate-tology."
2,Misguided book,"This is well written, but Fleischman is so in love with the possibilities of the ""life of the mind"" that he doesn't seem to understand how barren a life he's created for his character... and how unnecessary that barrenness is. Being disabled doesn't mean she can't have friends, fall in love, go to college, have a full, rich life in MANY dimensions! But the book's core philosophy sees nothing for her but an inner life... and sees nothing wrong with that, either. A distasteful thought experiment, this book."
4,Paul Fleischman succeeds again,"In Paul Fleischman's Mind's Eye, Courtney is a sixteen-year-old girl whose father left her and her mother when she was two. Countney did not get along with her stepfather so when her mother died, it made the situation worse. Courtney had a horse accident which has made her paralyzed. Her stepfather put her in a nursing home. She meets Elva who is eighty-eight years old and almost blind. Courtney and Elva take an imaginary trip to Italy using a 1910 travel guide. Even though the trip is only in the mind's eye, Courtney's need for love makes the journey real. Mind's Eye is a contemporary fiction book written in script."
5,A creative exploration into coping and happiness,"I have just finished ""Mind's Eye"" and am 'casting' the roles for my grade 9 class. I have prereading questions at the ready, and can't wait for my readers to present this fascinating drama to the class. I wish I had a couple of beds for the main characters to read from, but since this book deals with the ultra-power of the imagination, what the heck... Am going to search for a Baedeker 'Italy' (as old as I can find) just for authenticity. Many possibilities for discussion. Am sure the students writing will come easily. Truly thought provoking. Beautiful without being overly sentimental. Elva, I miss you."
1,Mind's Eye lacks depth,"I love Paul Fleischman's books usually, but I found this one to be a little strange. The characters lack development and depth. The story is told in script form, like a play, which is something that I found hard to follow. I would have liked to have known a bit more about the characters themselves (background and personalities).Of course, this is not the worst book I've ever read, but because it is lacking in many areas, I can't score it higher than one star."
2,Odd taste,All artificial. Has wickedly odd taste that is a huge turn off to an experienced coffee drinker. Would step closer of this one
1,not so good result,"I purchased to lower pressure on an outside faucet that is extremely high pressure. I have not tested the pressure, but it has burst three hoses. This device cannot handle the pressure. It completely closed off the flow and caused my pipes to bang. Oh well, on to other options."
5,Good product,"This regulator does what it is supposed to do.It is well built and does the job.I don't know what else to say but I have to write at least 20 words, so here they are."
5,Great read,"An excellent, well-written book on what Jesus meant by what he said and, in some cases, didn't say. It greatly enhanced my spirtiuality as I found it to be confirmation of many ideas I had about the scriptures."
3,Well-written,"What Jesus Meant is a well-written and thus pleasant read. It insufficiently attends to the historical details of Jesus' life and specifically to the harsher side of his character. Willis' Jesus is ""fair."" The historical Jesus was edgy.A perhaps better-written look at the mind of Jesus is James W. Miller's ""God Scent."" It takes the same tact, exploring the ""real"" meaning behind Jesus' teachings, but does so with a stronger style and attention to detail.Nonetheless, Willis' book could be an important part of a seeker's exploration of Christianity."
3,doesn't live up to the title,"Of course this book doesn't live up to its title--no one knows for sure what Jesus meant. This is a short book with some interesting ideas, worth considering, but the author has no special method of getting at Jesus' meanings. He proceeds as though what Jesus was reported as saying and doing in the gospels can all be taken at face value, without considering how the authors of the gospels may have shaped it to their own purposes and, yes, their own understandings of Jesus' meanings.With all of Wills' complaints about the pope and the Catholic church, its hard to understand why he is still a Catholic. Yes, I read his book ""Why I Am a Catholic"", but that didn't answer the question either. Says he loves the (Nicean) creed--but most churches adhere to the creed, not just the Catholic church.All in all, I find Wills' an interesting commentator on Christianity, but there are better authors out there on the topic.--Alan Zundel, the HeartAwake Center"
3,Change the Title of the Book!!,"The title should be changed to ""What Jesus Meant to Gary Wills, a Personal Quest."" I think that some his observations and ""theology"", if you Will, are too subjective and personal to be brought under the aegis of such a grandiose title. We would all like to be the authority who can say what Jesus ""really meant."" The problem is that rather than beginning with the presumptious proposition that he is ""right"" and that all other believers are ""wrong,"" and that his understanding of Jesus is authoritative while all others are flawed, he should have begun the book as a journal or personal quest; the book would have been more palatable..."
2,It began okay,"What Jesus Meant began in a promising manner; however, by the time I finished I couldn't help wondering if I had just finished a more modern and cleverly disguised manifesto of liberation theology. If Wills isn't truly embracing liberation theology, then he's certainly giving it a nod, wink, smile and pat on the back. He is also quick to point out that Jesus spent the majority of his time with ""sinners"" but he forgets to point out that Jesus would heal these people, instructing them to ""sin no more"" Jesus is reduced to an anti-religious, open minded and liberal hippie. I would recommend spending your money elsewhere."
2,Did I miss something?,"I read this at a friend's suggestion. I was disappointed. I came away with the idea that Wills was writing an argument to justify his personal social agenda. Mostly, though, I can't recall reading anything about repentance, atonement, and redemption. Did I miss something?"
2,Disappointed,"I was extremely disappointed in Mr. Wills book. His conservative approach to a complex subject lends virtually nothing you couldn't learn in a middle school Sunday school class. For a reader seeking to understand New Testament writings, Mr. Wills ccontributes nothing of value."
2,Oh dear...one for the choir,"I should have known better. I was hoping to find meaningful insights, but all Gary Wills has come up with is a different way of saying the same tired old things. He says that ""for creating radicals, there is nothing like a reading of the gospels,"" but don't expect anything radical here. He is singing to the choir..an evangelical/fundamentalist choir at that. So it's all about keeping strictly within the confines of a certain belief system..., belief NOT understanding. There is nothing here to broaden or deepen the reader's undestanding of God, Jesus or history. But then again, most of us want don't want that. Wherever he is, Jesus must be tearing his hair out."
2,Gary Wills is a heretic.,I'm quite disappointed that there are people in this world who can openly dissent from church teaching yet write and act as though the Church is the one dissenting. Wills thinks of himself as God by interpreting the bible to his own likings and to fit his own beliefs.
4,Great book,It is great to read about what his message really means in a larger context. Great job! Keep up the good work with the books about Jesus.
3,Who interviewed Jesus?,"Why is Mr. Will's opinion any different from anyone else? Aside from the authors of the Bible, I have never come across anyone who can lay claim that they interviewed Jesus. So why is Mr. Will's opinion any more valid than mine or yours? If more people would thoroughly and sincerely read the Bible, they would begin to understand the message of Jesus."
3,An ultimately doomed attempt at rational analysis of an irrational subject,"Garry Wills is one of those very few Christians (almost invariably Catholic) whom I can sort of respect---honest, knowledgeable, even intellectual, and perfectly willing to challenge fundamental tenets of his religion's dogma and to denounce the current pope and his predecessors. But in the end, it still comes down to blind faith in utterly unsupportable mystical gibberish---and his intelligence just makes it even more inexcusable, as it must require that much more evasion to maintain. Three and a half stars."
1,Pontificating,"Have you ever noticed how those who deny the authority of the Church Christ founded end up confering that authority upon themselves? Personally, I prefer a pontiff chosen by the Holy Spirit to Mr. Wills' self-proclaimed infallibility. Doesn't it strike anyone else as strange that a man with so much hubris might not be the best judge of what Jesus meant?"
1,Wills Wrong yet again.,Garry Wills knows what Jesus meant? Judging from this book I sincerely doubt it. Judging from the effusive praise it is also true that neither do most of the reviewers.
2,Pros and Cons,"Pros:Inexpensive Stereo cable with an excellent length (12ft).Cons:Creates a high-frequency, low-amplitude humming sound on speakers, possibly due to length and quality (I strongly doubt my other, high-quality, equipment is responsible). The humming sound is always there and the amplitude is constant, but it is only audible at low volumes, personally I cannot stand it.My Advise:At lengths over 6ft, spring for a quality cable (maybe something gold-plated) unless you don't mind a little static."
1,NOT GOLD PLATED,Very misleading photo. Shows GOLD colored connectors to mislead you into thinking that is what you are getting. That is not a photo of this product. This product has 3 ribs instead of 6 in the photo AND this product is not GOLD AND this product has slightly thinner wire. I wish I didn't buy 4 of these.
5,Best product for the value,I bought this AUX cables for connecting my laptop to my HDTV...Its almost been a year now and still I have no problems with it..and the sound quality is perfect....so if you see any expensive cables assuring with better quality....you probably would spend unnecessary money buying those....these work just finePlus amazon offers you a good cost on most of the things...shipping is free if you cross $25...
4,Good Quality product,Product met and exceeded expectations. Works very well with the equipment we use. Would recommend to other interested buyers. Thank you!
1,One of the most error prone Oracle Press books I've seen.,"Don't waste your money! Mr. Loney has not been trained properly on the Oracle Architecture and the way Oracle works. Mr. Loney's descriptions on background processes and the way the Oracle server work do not match what Oracle publishes or teaches.You are not required to take my word for it, read the Oracle8 Concepts Manual and the Oracle8 Administrators Guide, both published and updated by Oracle Corporation. (Available on the web at technet.oracle.com)This is not a personal attack, I'm sure he is a nice man but his book contains many factual errors that can be verified by referencing the Oracle documentation.I was an Oracle employee and instructor for Oracle Education and I have verified errors within the book.This book is no longer on my recommended reading list."
2,Cumbersome to follow writing with very few examples,"After seeing a good review on this book, I was looking forward to getting a lot out of Kevin Loney's information. What a disappointment!Although the technical content may be accurate (3 points), the writing style constantly led me into frustrating boredom. In my opinion, this book could benefit from including several hundred more examples to clarify its technical presenations.In contrast, I could hardly step away from the following SQL/Oracle books: ""Understanding the Oracle Server"", ""The Practical SQL Handbook"", ""The Data Warehouse Toolkit"", ""Oracle 7 for dummies"", etc. I found these authors' writing style engaging and technically informative.I would not recommend this book, except maybe for an extra technical reference that might someday provide some useful content."
3,"Not bad, but should be better","Oracle Press is in desperate need of better technical writers. This book does have decent amount of helpful information, but it's not written or organized very well, and there are errors in the text."
5,THE BEST OF THE THREE,I was not overly impressed with MARRY ME and BAD MAN'S BRIDE so I'm not sure why I picked up this book. Boy! Am I glad I did!! This is by far the best of her Bright sister books. It's a keeper! Will definitely order some more books by this author with hopes of finding the same kind of magic.
5,Susan Kay Law,"Susan has been writing wonderful novels for quite some time. I have been a fan of hers since the very first book ""Long Journey Home"" and own all of her novels. Susan's heroine is always an independent woman with dreams she is not afraid to go after by herself. I actually had the privilege of reading her first novel before it was published or even edited. Susan is the daughter of a minister and a librarian who, by her own admission, has been an avid reader since a young child. I recommend all of her books ~ if you read one you will want to read more!"
5,Best flip flops ever!,"These are the best flip flop sandals available for adults and kids. They are extremely well made and comfortable. The more you wear them, the more they mold to your feet. I have had the same pair of Rainbows for two and a half years and wear them all summer long to the beach and around town. They are still in great shape. My daughter is a size 3 1/2 youth and I ordered her a size 4/5. They fit very comfortably and should last into next summer."
5,outstanding,"One of the best Borenque singers in English or Spanish,period.If you don't know Spanish he gets down in English for you.Pure brown soul.Essential lowriding and highsiding music.""I never thougt you'd leave me"" is a bolero masterpiece.My only complaint is that they left off one song from the original vinyl (Negrona).Buy it! Guarenteed to please."
1,Do not buy this banjo case,"This is seriously the most poorly thought out and poorly constructed banjo case imaginable.Most annoyingly the clips on the straps are horrible and come off frequently. Literally even walking 5 blocks, the banjo will basically fall off of my back at least two times.Additionally the ring at the top of the bag is ripping through the loop that holds it onto the case.Incredibly, there is no place to put a music book or even a few papers without folding them at least once. This makes no sense.Please do yourself a favor and buy another banjo case."
2,Needs more deoderizing in the formula,"I used this product for the first time. I cleaned three floor rugs today with this product. Two of the rugs had no pet smell lingering, but the last rug, which was the most smelly, still had a strong pet smell after cleaning it. I will probably have to re-do this last rug because of the high use it receives and since the dogs tend to like to sit on it. The deoderant in the formula needs to be stronger since pet smells are so strong. Also the formula could use more brighteners in it since I don't see much of a difference after cleaning the rugs."
3,Not what i thought,"Okay, so i truly thought this album would have some traditional celtic music without the new age fancy smancy. Boy was i wrong. The songs worthy of mention are ""Eanair"", which is a beautiful song and one of the best on the album, ""The Sky Road"" which is touching and sad, ""The Child Dierdre"" which too is beautiful, ""Mna Na hEireann"" is so so wonderful and just flat out pretty even if i don't know what the song means, ""Sean Deora"" is my favorite song on the whole album and the vocals are outstanding (kudos to Kila), and ""He moved through the Fair"" is beautiful all unto itself. The well known ""Riverdance"" is good too, leaves the dancing to yer imagination. I just have to say that some of the songs unmentioned sound way to close to western country music for my liking, and the strange new age songs help throw the stars down to 3. But the songs i mentioned are awesome. I probably would buy this album knowing what it was just for those songs. Best o Tidings to all."
1,Worst WLAN router I've ever had,"So, I've had this router for a few months now. It works, but drops connections eg. when using torrents. Also, the router is always in NAT-mode and there is no alternative. Also, setting ANY setting at all requires router reboot.It also claims to support multicast, but really it doesn't - the current firmware is broken. So no watching IPTV with this."
1,FTP Problems,"This router did not allow me to upload to certain websites using various ftp software.Tech support was terrible.Also, speed of the router was nothing special.Very dissapointed with this product."
2,Router Resets,I 've installed this on 3 pc's and 1 network printer and have had problem with having to reset it. The resets were for not being able to see other pc's and loosing connection with network printer internet. I've had another wired router on these pc's before and had no reset problem of this magnitude. I've updated to latest firmware but still problems. I might have return for another router. not happy.
2,Not very good range,"I bought this hoping for a greater range and was not happy with it. I returned it because every time I used my 2.4G cordless phone in the house, my internet connection got drop. This is NOT acceptable. D-Link needs to take a lesson in design from Apple."
4,how new is the pc,"For all those writing a review for this product, it would be really helpful if you mentioned how many cpu's your computer is. I have a pentium 4 2 GB. and am wondering if this router will work well for me.I want to network it to an even older pc, a windows 98 pentium 800!So it will help to know if anyone else has an older pc it works with. Thanks!"
4,I'm hooked!,"When I started to read the first book in this series, The Island of Heavenly Daze, I was, honestly, a little worried it would be ""too religious"" for me. That wasn't the case and I thought it was a sweet book but nothing overwhelming. Only because I already had the second in the series, Grace in Autumn, I read it too. And now I'm totally hooked on the characters and the little quirky Maine island! I'm eager to find out more about what's happening in their lives and if anyone will figure out who the angels are. Don't be put off by the spiritual aspect of these books - they are sweet, funny and uplifting no matter what your beliefs are."
5,Awesome!,"Awesome! I fell in love with Heavenly Daze. It is truly inspiring to know that the Spirit of the Lord comes through even a fictitious story, which means that the Spirit of the Lord dwells within the authors. I look forward to reading many more or the Heavenly Daze novels. Thank you and God bless you."
5,So funny!,I only ordered this book cause it was about a Maine island and since I am from Maine I bought it. Thought the whole angel thing might not be down my alley but it is just so funny and I feel like a part of the family on this island already. I loved it so much that I order the other 4 books in the series as soon as I finished the first book. It is a great story and I can't wait to find out what will be next. I laughed out loud while reading this book and I rarely ever do this. Very good read.
1,UK Hard-Rock Heavy Metal Band,Its confusing to have 2 bands around with the exact same name and with a very similar logo. I much prefer the US Band Hangnail. If you like Heavy Duty Rock with a throw back feel to some of the most well known UK heavy metal bands of the 70's and 80's this album is for you. If you were expecting the US punkish style melodic rock Hangnail it isn't. It's OK but not my style.
2,came in very bad condition it said good,the plastic package is all broken and in very bad shape but the movie itself was in good shape ...we all love the movie but a better explanation of the plastich box would have been more of what i expected good is not all broken that would be very poor shape but movie still plays ..
3,Pacheco's beginnings,"Johhny Pacheco paired up with Charlie Palmieri and Jose Fajardo to record this duly titled ""Charangas"". This was just before Pacheco and Palmieri split because of creative differences because Pacheco wanted to go in a different direction, which led him to create ""Y su Nuevo Tumbao."" Make sure you're aware that this is a charanga album and not a salsa, as Pacheco would later go on to record. Although the Cuban music style is not of my taste, ""Verano de Amor"" and ""Moliendo Cafe"" are quite enjoyable. Can't say I like it or hate it."
1,Ignore the bogus reviews,"This is a d-grade oater and nothing more. The other so-called reviews are duplicate frauds meant to hype the movie, though why one would devote one's life to that must be pretty pitiful."
1,CD Technology or PRINCO ?,"I was quite supprised when I opened the shipping box with this item. The DVD-RW media is in a box labeled PRINCO. There is a ""quality assurance"" sticker sealing the box shut. The QA label reads ""CD Technology"".The packaging indicates quite clearly that these disks are made by PRINCO. Why does this bother me so? Maybe it has to do with having read so many bad things about PRINCO. I am quite displeased by this..."
1,never worked right,"The CD player did not work from day 1. The songs have ""dead spots"" in them. There is no antenna to raise for better radio reception, either."
1,cheap,"The sound quality is that of a transistor radio.The buttons for the tape recorder don't even say what they are for. It is much smaller then it appears on the ad. The worth is about $5.00, save your money!"
4,Good for the price,"I bought this for my husband two years ago, and it still works well. My husband mainly uses this when he's working throughout the house. It gives good sound for the size and price."
1,Save your money,"sure it seems cheap with lots of features. save your money. the am fm is useless. its the old fashioned wheel, not digital. thats not even the issue though. you cannot get stations. even local stations that are 50,000 watts of power dont hardly come in.the cd skips on occassion and the tape looses sound in spots. the stereo sound is akin to a transistor radio.in short, i am throwing it out. its not worth 5 dollars. you get what you pay for. go for something else."
1,expired date,I bought this case on 2/25/07.When I received the case all packages had a sell by date of 01/25/07.Very disappointing when you are trying to resell something outdated!!
3,Let's Get the Names Right,"It's difficult to understand how a publisher cannot get the authors' names correct. The authors are Rudi (not ""Ridi"") Blesh AND Harriet Janis; Blesh was always insistent that Janis receive equal credit.The book, itself, is of major importance to our understanding of ragtime history. It was published in 1950 and its story has, in many respects, been supplanted by more recent research and writings. But it was an inspiration for ragtime fans from 1950 on, and remains an irreplaceable source for information about many of the original ragtimers interviewed by Blesh and Janis. Our knowledge of ragtime, its culture, and the history of that time, would be greatly lessened without this book.Ragtime: A Musical and Cultural HistoryKing of Ragtime: Scott Joplin and His Era"
4,Forensics,"This book provides interesting and very informative info on the history of forensic science. It explores the many fields of forensics including: toxicology, fingerprints, forgery, ballistics, forensic anthropology, photo-FIT, and DNA analysis. It also inludes the big names and historic cases in the world of forensic investigation. Excellent photo's give it a very nice look as well. This book averaged a readabillity grade level of about 10.5. This book is great for anyone wanting to learn about forensics ranging in age from 6th grade to 12th."
5,Simply AMAZING!!,"It has all the info you will ever need on chameleons! this has helped me raise several generations of Jackson's! It has deitailed reports on A LOTof chameleon species! this is a MUST Own! oh, and did i mention the THOUSANDS of color photos?"
2,Pretty heavy,"I was looking for some light weight plain black shoes for everyday use. This item is plain alright, but pretty damn heavy. I ended up returning it so can't comment on the comfort."
4,I use as dog bowls,I bought these to use as dog bowls for my small dog- she's only 9 lbs so this size works well. While fine used as a pet bowl- I did notice some little black specks in the glaze that look like a flaw to me- I wouldn't care for that if I was using on my table.
3,A classic,"I remember the excitement when Hasbro released this figure in the late 1990s - the first Rebel Fleet Trooper ever. The sculpt is still pretty realistic, if on the muscular side. However, there have been better versions, including the incredible new 2011 Vintage version. If you want to get a few Rebel Fleet Troopers, I'd recommend spending your money on those ones first."
3,What movie is this?,"Models and strippers. Yawn. It has a nice cover. More of a novelty DVD, it is what it is."
4,"Excellent product, well built","Bought these for my house after a neighbor was burglarized. Schlage quality shows in all aspects of this product. Inserting and turning the key is nearly effortless. The included screws and hard ware are the REAL DEAL. Follow the easy instructions precisely and you will have a door that is darn hard to kick in! I would give 5 stars but I do not like the brushed finish on this, was hoping for something a little smoother, but don't let looks be your reason to buy a crappy lock that gets your home burglarized!!! This lock is above and beyond the cheaper products from companies like Kwikset. Set this deadbolt next to your old one when you uninstall it and do a side by side, you'll see right there how THICK and STRONG this thing is. I sleep a lot better now and don't worry so much. Also, the Grady reseller experience was ideal, no trouble with them, quick shipping."
1,when i got the tape the top piece of the tape was broken,when i got the tape the top piece of the tape was broken you shouldn't sale stuff that is broken
4,fascinating and insightful,"this book was fascinating. the author offers what i found to be incredible insights. it is quite dated, but it is nevertheless greatly worthwhile reading, given that i have not had a course in anthropology and this was free on kindle. i rate it at a B minus."
1,no,the reason I can not rate this book is because I know nothing about it and have never seen before I do not know where this came from
1,Don't waste your money or your time,"I am extremely disappointed in this book and glad that it cost me only $10! It was advertised as scholarly, entertaining and useful. It is none of these things. It is poorly written, not documented and useless. Don't bother. There are much better books than this. Also, having had such a poor experience with this book, I will certainly avoid any others in this ""series"": ""The Home University of Modern Knowledge."" What a waste!"
5,A Spiritual Treasure,"This House is on Fire is a rare reading experience. I was absorbed and uplifted by the beautifully told and illustrated story of Dhyanyogi's life, the story of the boy-to-be saint and his remarkable spiritual journey through 116 years -- from the safety and comfort of his childhood home, to the wilds of India, to the seeking and finding of his true teacher on Mt. Abu, to himself finding and teaching the child who would become his spiritual heir, to their travels in America. This biography resonates with that part of me that wants to be more spiritual. It makes me aware of the profound beauty of a spiritual life and shows me the way to increase my own spiritual attainment, even as a citizen of the modern world. This is the most valuable spiritual book on my bookshelf, and it keeps inviting me to pick it up again and again."
3,An average read of a great life,"I liked how the book began but towards the end it became a bit repetitive and lacking content. However, if you are interested in reading about spiritual lives and find inspiration in them this book is surely next to no other. It will inspire you in many ways."
5,Hard-to-find dough hook found,"The Sunbeam stand mixer purchased at WalMart shows a picture of a dough hook and where to insert it but had no dough hook included with the mixer. After some detective work on the internet, I found the item number for the hook and found it right away on Amazon. What a find! Brand new and just what I was looking for. Thanks."
5,one of the greatest dance songs ever (to me)!!!!,jocelyn enriquez is the most underrated dance singer/ dj/ performer of all time... she has quite possibly the best dance tracks in the 90s... first it was 'a little bit...' and that started the dance/r&b; mix to dance... then she came out with the instant classic 'do you miss me>?'.... this song is just the best song in my dance collection....i love the original mix it is just timeless and it just is non-stop brilliance....the way she is singing makes it seem that her lost love is missing jocelyn more than her is missing him....energybox remix is just out of this world...the extended mix is just the longer version of the brilliant original mix....if you want to dance all night long to a classic.... get this 9 remix cd... great sound... ahead of its time....5 out of 5 stars
5,Love my Jocelyn,"I met her the other night in Memphis at a club called Amnesia. She is so cute, such a doll in person! What a great performer. Anyway, she is so very friendly too. After talking with her, she had told me how nice it was to meet me and appreciated us coming to see her. I have been a long time fan of Jocelyn and she lives up to all my expectations. This is one of my favorite songs of hers. The remixes are awsome. There are actually 10 tracks on this cd. Buy this, you will certainly get your moneys worth. And if you ever get the change go see this wonderful woman, do so, she is unbelieveable, and CUTE TOO!"
1,disappointed,"I have a pair of chaco's and really enjoy them. I wanted a nice looking pair that is more for casual wear and purchased these. They look very nice, however I could not even get them on my foot! I do not have fat feet, but still could not slip these on without forcing my foot in. I suppose if your feet are very thin, you won't have any trouble. If your feet swell at all, I definetely would not recommend these, you might not be able to get them off. I still like chaco's for their arch support, but perhaps their earlier shoes that have adjustable straps are better."
4,What I Expected,"I bought this mainly for use on my TV in my room for when I play Xbox 360. I wasn't expecting anything super fancy, but this works just fine. When I first tried it though it sounded like the left ear wouldnt work coming through this extension, but just by rotating the jack end of my headphones in the female end of the extension cable it would work just fine. It doesnt slip around either, so i dont have to constantly readjust. I just have to adjust it once when I plug it in.Also, if the part where you connect the headphones and the extender gets banged on things while wearing the headphones there is a sort of annoying snapping sound in the headphones, but this is also true of any extender i have ever used before."
2,I'd pass on this if I had to purchase again,This product does exactly what it claims to do...it extends my audio by 6 feet. It arrived quick and in perfect condition.However where it fails is the sound. The sound quality is horrible. My music sounds scratchy and tinny. I've used it for 15 minutes and I'm already shopping for a new extension.
5,everything perfect,"The Cable came quickly and worked perfectly for me. I have nothing but good to say. It was cheap and allows me to attach my PandaGOgroove Panda Pal High-Powered Portable Mini Speaker System for Smartphones , Tablets , MP3 , Laptop Computers and More!speaker to my laptop without having the speaker right on top of me. I use it ALL the time at work and I am very happy."
2,Didn't last too long,"I attached it to a microphone, and the cable worked well for a while. After 4 months, it just died. Shame really..."
2,3.5 mm Cable review,Unfortunately the male side did not fit well in multiple computers. I have the leave the connection half way out in order to hear music when I use my headsets. Due to the inexpensive price it is not worth trying to return. I would not purchase this product again.
2,Works after FIDDLING,"This is VERY CHEAP cable. Here are my complains about it.Pros- It does what it's supposed to do (with some trouble)Cons- Very cheap- Very heavy and thick- You have to fiddle around with the male end, otherwise you'll get static"
2,Did not work well,I tried using it with Iphone earbuds. Sound diminished so much I could not use it. Quality looked good though.
2,Connectors weren't flushed,"I would have to have the headphone jack in a specific position in order to get full sound to come through. Once you tug on the cord, you will need to swivel the 3.5mm parts to complete the connection. Other than that, it worked."
2,Cable would not stay connected to phone,"Bought this cable as an extension to plug my phone in. The male end connected to the phone wouldn't stay tight and kept 'bouncing' out. Its the second cable I had this problem with so I don't know if my phone is odd, but the cable I grabbed off the shelf at the store worked fine."
1,Received an empty envelope,I order two of these cables and received an empty envelope. I will not order from this provider again.
5,Just what I needed,Its just the right length and works really well. Its exactly what I wanted. I do wounder if gold would have been better though. Other then that Im perfectly happy with my purchase.
1,Doesn't maintain stereo contact,"Plugged it in, didn't work. Oh. You have to plug it in to the second click. Started listening not stereo. Went to adjust the connection, stereo! Sat back in my chair (no pressure on cord), mono. Moved again, stereo. Will have to buy a different product from a different company."
5,Simple and cheap,"Such a simple product, it's really hard to screw it up. The cable works as I expected and it was practically free (and a good part of that went to postage)"
2,"Cheap product, not well-made","I purchased this extension cord to listen to music from my PC at work. When I opened the package I discovered that the end that plugs into the PC was bent and the receiving end that the headphones plug into was slightly too large for a 3.5 mm input. The result was that my headphones kept disconnecting from the extension cord whenever I moved. Reading other reviews, this seems to be a common flaw in this product. Shipping back to the seller makes a more expensive purchase than buying the other extension cord available at Amazon. Save yourself time and money, buy the Maxell."
2,You get what you pay for,"These cables have some serious problems. I bought four, and they all reverse the left and right channels. How is that even possible if they're mass produced? For people who care about the stereo image using headphones, that's not acceptable. You can always reverse your headphones or ear buds, but you shouldn't have to.One of them also has intermittent sound in one channel if you move the cable around.So they are not great cables. I get the impression that these are the ones that failed quality control at the factory so they're unloading them at cost."
2,Low quality cable. Avoid.,"The connections, both at the plug and the jack, are not built to spec and are quite loose in all of the headphone jacks and headphones I've tried. Any movement of the cable causes the connection points to slip and slide, causing one or both channels to drop out or cause static to be heard.Very disappointing and the cable is going into the garbage because it would cost more than I paid originally to return it."
2,"It works, but there's this annoying static sound","This cable is really cheap, but it's also made really cheaply. I hear this obnoxious static sound when i have no music playing. It's not noticeable when there's music playing, but I will definitely a higher quality cable when this cable inevitably breaks."
4,it works,"extends a 3.5mm cable. sound quality is shady some times, gotta wiggle the wires for better sound, but overall works fine."
3,Alright,"When I started using this I started hearing a little feedback. Also the jack is a little smaller than it should be so it doesn't fit as snugly as it should, meaning you may have to wiggle it to get all sound levels. It works and was a decent buy for the money, but I'd advise you to spend a little more and buy a nicer cable."
1,Useless,Audio was so garbled and un-audible that they were unusable. I wouldn't trust this the slightest. I had to throw these out because it wasn't worth the money to ship back.
3,Affordable but Cheap,"Cable seemed thick and heavy, but the connector is tight, crooked and ill-fitting. When headphones are plugged in with too much pressure, one channel loses connection. Cheap and gets the job done but don't give it as a gift or anything if you like the person."
4,Works well,"I received the cable quickly. It works perfectly, and it isn't super kinked up or anything coming out of the package. I get great sound, and doesn't come unplugged all the time or anything. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I had to fiddle with the connection when I plugged my earbuds from Apple (came with my iPhone). The fit was too tight, and I had to twist the connection point until I could hear everything. However, the second pair of headphones I plugged in work perfectly with it, so it could just be that particular set that's a little odd. All in all, I'd recommend it."
3,"Ordered two, one good , other with loose connections..","Overall its a workable product for the price. I had ordered 2 and one was with loose connections. But after tweaking the sockets, it remains fine. So not a bad product."
2,poor quality,The cable arrived pretty quick but the connector started buzzing a stopped working after about two weeks of light use. The cable was very poor quality. Do yourself a favor and get one for way less on monoprice.
2,Nice when it worked.,The cable was great when it functioned. It has very tight clearances which makes all of the connections nice and snug.After about 6 months the audio stopped working in the left headphone/speaker rendering it somewhat useless.
3,its alright,"The extension cord of this product is good, and seems somewhat solid, but as i plug in regular headphones in to my device its normal, but when i plug the headphones into the product, and the products connected to my phone , it looses sound a little bit."
2,"5 feet, not 6","** MISLEADING PRODUCT DESCRIPTION **I use headphones all the time, both with my computer setup and my TV setup. Headphone cables are way too short for these uses on their own, so I need extension cables. They tend to go bad rather quickly. When I searched this time I found these supposed 6 foot cables. I figured that would be just about right (barely), as 3 feet is way too short, but the 12 foot cables I've been using are overkill. So I bought two of them. I just received them and they seemed rather short, so I measured. They are just barely 5 feet, including the length of the plugs on both ends. Not worth returning or complaining for a couple bucks each, but it sure is annoying. So buyer be warned, these are FIVE FOOT CABLES, not six."
4,Nice,Good product and it does exactly what I wanted it to do. I would buy here agin anytime for sure.
4,good,"well i had at first thought that i had a crummy cable but, someone for the company called and said that they are willing to help and that they value me as a customer and i was very pleased with there support, so if you do get a bad cable they will talk to you and help you out, they are worth your time and money."
5,audio cable extension,"good quality, works great and -even with shipping, is quite a bit cheaper than similar ones available at local stores."
5,sweet,how could you review this bad... simple cable works 100 % for my use which was to extend my headphones so i don't wake my lil newborn when i Veg out on Battlefield 3
5,Works Well!,I needed a extension cord because my headphone cable is just to short. I keep pulling on the cord and my headphones fall off. I bought these because they are cheap and long enough. I received them fast and plugged them in a they work with no problems.
4,too short,"6 ft doesn't stretch as far as one might think, make sure you don't need more. Other than that, this cord does the job."
1,not a 3.5mm plug,"The jack is not a 3.5mm plug. It's similar but has 4 contact points instead of 3( right, left, and common). I tired jamming it into a 3.5mm female, but only getsound from 1 channel. So useless."
1,It doesn't work.,I bought 2 of these to use in office for attending online trainings as my current head set's wire is too small.I could hardly hear anything with this extension cable.I cannot return these items. For returning these items I have to spend more money than I spent to buy them.Amazon should not allow this kind of sellers/products. If they sell this item outside I wouldn't have bought these. I just believed Amazon and bought these.I know they are very cheap. But they are not working at all.
3,"ordered two, one of them is bad",I orderd two of these at the same time and they both arrived promptly. One of them worked fantastic the other one and a malfuntion and only played right side of the speaker. i would send it back but its so cheap i would prolly spend more on shipping than i paid for it.
3,Bad quality control,"I ordered three of these cheap cables made by an ""off brand"" with the risk of bad quality in mind; I'm glad I did. The first one had an intermittent left channel upon first use and that channel finally failed. I now have the second cable in use with no problems immediately apparent. The third cable is still being held in reserve and is untested. I still consider the cables to be a ""good deal"" at the price; but, I advise caution in buying because of the apparent poor quality control. The old adage about getting what you pay for is true in this case. If, like me, you are willing to buy extras ""just in case,"" then you will probably beat the odds and get at least one good cable without spending much. Otherwise, look for a quality name brand and spend a couple extra bucks."
4,Only right channel works. Good customer service,"On first time use only the right channel works. The left channel works as described. I don't know what else to say. Good price I guess. So sad.EDIT: After filling a complaint, the company replied to me the next day and issued a full refund without me having to return the item. Great customer service."
1,go to radio shack,"the item worked well for two weeks, then a connection became loose somewhere in the cable, it is now pretty much unusable. might use it as string."
2,worked for 2 month,"This product worked well for about 2 months. As of now, no sound comes from the left side of my headphones once connected to this extension cable. Worked perfectly for two month and with the sub 2 dollar price point, I'll give it two star. Will not buy from Abacus24-7 anymore though."
5,3.5 MM M/F extension cable,Hi quality with soft exterior sheath that is not going to break and will stand up to vibrations better than the hard plastic type. The connectors are annodized for better conductivity and better sound. Highly recommend this one over the others on the market
4,First one didn't work. Second did.,"Negative: quality control let a defective one pass.Positive: it works when not defective.Conclusion: it's cheap, does the job."
4,makes using headphones from a long distance easy and comfortable,"Bought this and it works great it allows me to comfortably use my headphones to listen to music on my computer,tv,Music player,and other audio devices can use all of my devices from anywhere in my room and still be comfy, cheap good reliable cord which works as good as the day i got it, no more moving your head and having the headphone plug in come out of your audio device, if you get this you can use this with all audio devices that are compatible with headphones"
5,Just what I needed,I had no problems with this order and this product was exactly what I needed for my TV ears. I would recommend this company to anyone
1,Poor sound quality. Piece of crap.,Sound does not come out of one side of the headphones that I'm using. I've tried multiple connections with different headphones and they all have the same problem - this crappy extension cable that only produces sound to one side. Terrible.
1,oh well.,"I guess the old adage, if it seems to good to be true, it probably is. Only one channel works so I just looked at getting a better quality cable."
1,Trust the negative reviews--I wish I had.,"I read enough negative reviews on this that I should have known better than to buy it--I guess I got what I deserved. The male fitting is so loose that I couldn't get a good connection unless I held it in a certain position and even then it didn't work very well. The cable is also very thick and not very flexible. I contacted the company about a refund, but I didn't get anywhere with them. It wasn't worth the battle for $2 bucks, so I gave up and threw it away."
2,Poor audio quallity,The cord produces poor audio quality. I took a chance on this cheapo to save $. The gamble was a waste of money.
3,you get what you pay for,"surprisingly skinny wire for what it is, kind of similar to ear bud headphone wire. still, it works as it should and that's it. but not something you will push big cans through or want to move around much. you get what you pay for."
1,Bad Construction,"The cable I received does not work properly. The left and right channels are crossed.I noticed this problem when I was watching a movie on my computer, and after some trouble shooting, I discovered that the cable was the problem."
1,Doesn't even fit 3.5mm,"As some of the other reviews have stated -- the one I got does not fit a 3.5mm cable, the female end is larger than a 3.5mm making this pretty useless. It seems 2/3 of these do not have the issue according to these reviews."
2,Poor Quality,"The female connector portion was a loose fit and took some fiddling to get both ears working. It was annoying, but it was bearable, until the cable completely stopped working out of one of the ears. Overall, just poor quality. The seller on the other hand was excellent."
5,"cheap, Cheap, CHEAP!",I bought some CHEAP speakers only to find that the cord would not reach my PC. Most extensions I found (including at local stores) cost about as much as the speakers OR MORE! This one is plenty cheap and works fine for my purposes. Did I mention how little it costs? Works fine. Cheap... real cheap...
4,does the job!,"Came to my office quick and it is as its described. Does the job, good quality, will buy from this company again."
5,Another Great Christmas Album,"This album was put out by Goodyear and is a great one at that. On it are some artist you will never hear again: Eileen Farrell (the only female include in the album), Nelson Eddy and Earl Wrightson. Also include are: Percy Faith, Norman Luboff Choir and the Morman Tabernacle Choir. This is simply a great album to own."
5,The Tall Book of Make Believe,For all those who were ecstatic at Golden Press' reprint of TheGiant Golden Book of Elves and Fairies - take heart! The same authorand illustrator created the equally wonderful The Tall Book of Make Believe - .... If you want your children and grandchildren's intellects enriched beyond computer games find this delightful book.
4,King air,The design of this fan could have easily been slightly different and allowed for a much easier installation.It is an excellent fan.
2,Design flaws but OK.,"Regular size light bulbs will not fit. You need thinner ones to clear a metal bracket. Also, you have to screw the glass cover on blind because you cant see what your doing. When the motor dies good luck finding a replacement."
3,Its just ok,"I thought this fan would be a little nicer. yes it is pretty quiet, however as far as the fan itself... well It basicly does nothing, it cant even keep the mirror from fogging up when you take a quick shower. I only have a 6x8 bathroom its in so it should clear it with no issue. I would spend a little more money and get somthing that works."
3,"NOT an ""EASY"" snap-in","It does anything BUT ""easily installs using the included snap-in mounting system"" as the fan will not be securely held in place by this system once it is wrestled into place. You'll get the hardware installed ok, but trying to snap it in is very difficult and will cause the metal frame to bend. This will cause the instability.If you have plenty of working room, you could snap it in from above, but then you might as well buy a cheaper non-snap in fan.Other than that, it is a fan like any other fan having this noise rating."
2,Poor quality,"The sound is a bit loud, but I can deal with it. However it is very weak and does not appear to suck out the hot air at all. I would definitely spend more money next time."
3,Really nice fan but very difficult as replacement,"I bought this as a replacement for an old fan. Now that it's installed I'm very happy with it. It's relatively quiet, moves air well and I think looks nice.But as other reviewers have pointed out the design makes it very difficult to install unless you can get above the ceiling such as in an attic. The problem is the bracket requires you to put the fan in place first, then attach the ductwork. I would think they could make a fairly easy design change that would allow you to attach the duct to the unit from underneath through the whole in the ceiling, run the power through, then drop the unit in place and secure it there.So for new construction or maybe in the top floor of a house with attic access I would give this 5 stars but for any other kind of replacement I would give it 1 star. Average 3."
4,Very nice Bathroom Fan,I really like mine. Yes it is a bit noisy just like any other exhaust fan. The only draw back was when you go to mount it in the ceiling the fan wants to blow right into the insulation. I recommend going to Lowes or Home depot or ordering an attachment piece to aim the exhaust up instead of into the insulation. Otherwise no complaints here.
1,"Awful, do not buy","A truly terrible purchase that I regret. First, the installation bracket is impossible to work with, buy the time I managed to get fan into place the bracket bent and would not snap into place. I was forced to drill holes in the plastic housing to drill into the stud. Despite claims, there is no way to put this in without crawling into the attic. Finally, the air flow is terrible, it barely moves any air, and certainly nothing near the 90 cfm that it claims. Complete waste of money, I will replace shortly and throw away."
1,Probably Amazon's Error,"Was looking to replace all 3 fans in bathroom. Typed bathroom fan with light and this shows up. Looking at the Picture, the bright spot in the middle, assumed its light and ordered 3 of them. Go to install, none have light. Looked at details on air king website and it does not mention light. Therefore returning it. Otherwise, no issue with product."
4,Easy installation! Works great!,"This fan was very easy to install and works great with the timer switch I bought with it. The only thing I have bad to say about it is the bracket that it mounts to on the beam is a little bit flimsy. I bent it slightly while installing it and I didn't get it back into the correct place. But even with that, the fan doesn't vibrate at all and still is pretty quiet."
1,unhappy with pillow,This pillow looked nice in picture...but turned out to be made of extremely junky fabric and poor quality sewing. Just plain ugly.
4,rating,loved it - my mother in law loved it - would have loved it as a kindle version but understand the reason why it was not in kindle.
4,Good book,I enjoyed this book but I was a little disappointed at the lack of focus it had on Elizabeth's and Wynn's new marriage. Most of the book is about Elizabeth adjusting to her new life in the north and the people she meets there. After the first book I was looking forward to getting to know them better as a couple but their new life keeps them apart most of the time. Overall I am glad that I read this book but I did miss the charm that Wynn had in the first one.
4,New series,"I loved the first book in the series, so was anxious to continue the saga. The second book was well written, but perhaps not as compelling as the first. I found the continuing references to faith to be overdone at times, but clearly the author's purpose is to evangelize throughout the story using the voices of the characters."
3,The Book of Suffering and Survival,"The book ""When Comes The Spring"" is an okay book. I would most likely give it a four on a scale of one to ten, ten being it's the best book ever.It's a book that has a tad of mystery, but very little if any at all. I would say it's a quiet book really, no real excitement.My favorite character would have to be Elizabeth Thatcher, or Beth for short. Beth is the main character in the story. I like her best because she loves animals, and is funny when it comes to hurting animals. Well a little funny, funny like over-reactive funny.I wouldn't exactly recomend this book, but I wouldn't not recomend this book either. You will understand when, and if, you read the book."
5,Sweet love story,I don't like love stories but this one was sweet and not graphic. It has a good faith based story.
5,Enjoyable!,"The second book in this series is as powerfully written as the first book, but with new characters! I have come to love Nimmie as much as I love Elizabeth! It's amazing to see how much Elizabeth has changed (in a good way) with the ways of the North to be a stronger woman!"
3,Tired of the crying,"I enjoyed the Oke series ""Loves Comes Softly"" so my family decided to give me this series as a present. It is very different and a bit disappointing. The first book is ok but now Elizabeth is crying all the time. She was alone during the first book at her teacherage and was able to cope but the constant whining in When comes the Spring is a bit too much for me to take."
5,Great series!!,This series is absolutely wonderful - great story of a wonderful Christian couple. I love following their marriage & growth.
4,GREAT SERIES,"When Comes the Spring (Canadian West Book # 2) This series is great. I always try to put myself in the main character's part when reading, and i get more out of the book that way. Janette Oke is a great writer."
2,Too Religious!,"I didn't know this series was going to be super religious, but that's definitely where it went after book one! Not my style."
4,Loved it,Great book. Reminded me of home in Canada. I couldn't put the book down. Would reccomend it to anyone that likes adventure in the West.
1,Low Quality,"I felt this product was misrepresented. It didn't work, I didn't pursue a return and threw it out.Buyer beware."
4,Swingin' Love from the Crossroads,"I have to tell you, I know these guys, so I'm partial already. In throwing this disc out to my friends here in WNC, many of them comment on the Gin Blossoms-esque vibe K&B tend to send. That's just marginal listening, if you ask me. In the tradition of The Hang-Ups, The Coctails and Let's Active, these 4 youngsters have set the tone for Hi-Fli sweet, melodious pop. I dare you to find a more infectious tune than ""Talk...."" All sorts of goodness in that one. No use talkin' bout the others. Those who know the glory that is K&B are far more wordy and lyrical than I. I know because I've spent the last month watching them out-wordsmith each other on-line, arguing about the best albums of the 90's. Give in to guilty pleasure, potential buyer. If you enjoy a well-crafted pop song like those of Paul Weller or Marshall Crenshaw etc. etc., give K&B a try."
4,All 3 of Michael Crichton's Early Works in One!,"I've read new works of Michael Crichton, and I liked them very much. Since these three books are the ones that threw him into a fame as a thriller, I decided to check it out. And I didn't believe there was a volume like this! Very good deal to have your favorite author's early works packed in one hardcover, since you can't find hardcovers in any book store these days, and only online is where you can buy, but then, all of the price combined is certainly greater than this one. Again, a very good deal at a very good price."
2,some good ideas,somegood ideas but unfortunately it seems that chris just don't have the playing skills or imagination to cutit like Mr.Jordan or Mr.brown .What gets my nerve is just how much the uk smooth scene bigs him up just coz his british .If u want some good British artists check out the Ronny Jordan back catalog or Peter Whites for that matter
5,Chris has magic fingers.,"This CD takes you away to a tranquil place where you can relax and forget everyday chores. Soul Express is fantastic with a feeling of dreams and embrace. Kaleidoscope has one of the most soft solos that is very well played and I'm really impressed with Chris ability to find the feeling and getting it out of his fingers without doing to much and avoiding to ruin the moment.Chris Standring is an enigma in that sense that he has a fantastic ability to bring out a feeling out of his music and he is not overdoing it, like other artists do. It's almost like he knows what the listener is feeling, and keeps them in that moment.I can recommend touch the moon, that is not on this record, but are available on his site."
4,good stuff,"This offering from Chris Standring is a little more on the pop side, but he does a stellar job of mixing it up. Hip Sway was funkier and is my fav, but you can't go wrong with any of Standring's music."
4,Mas salsa para gozar,"Este CD es increible y contradictorio. Tiene temas extraordinarios como ""Magdalena"", ""S.E.R.A"", ""El Mundo se acaba"" pero tambien temas muy aburridos. El sonido esta vez es extraordinario (mucho mejor que los demas). Otra vez estan Justo Betancourt y Adalberto Santiago haciendo coros, Este disco por los temas buenos me gusta mas que el primero pero por sus temas regulares no es tan excepcional como el ""Cada loco con su tema"". Altamente recomendable para recordar las orquesta de salsa honesta de los 70 como La Diferente, Orquesta Narvaez, La Terrifica, Orquesta Dicupe, Revolucion 70, entre otras. Solo para conocedores"
1,Too Cheap,"I knew this was cheap, but thought it would be a bit more durable. The cover is a thick cardboard, but the pages are so thin you can see through them and feel like they will disintegrate. I returned the book, it was too fragile for my two year old."
2,Claims to be the original version,"It is missing two lines on the first page - the ones that start 'Of skating and coasting...' Also, it was Donner in the original, not Donder. Other lines are out of order. One stanza has been changed completely from 'And seeing who stood there, so real and so near, While telling the tale we've already told here: ' to 'At seeing who stood there, a paw's length away, And told of the darkness and fog and delay,' REINDEER DO NOT HAVE PAWS! Also changed was 'The horrible fear that children might waken,' to 'And Santa's great worry that children might waken.' There are more, but I won't bore you with them. Why change things? Especially when it is claimed on the dust jacket that it is the original story.The pictures were quite pleasant."
5,Very Cute,Cute Christmas board book with squeaky Rudolph. My 20-month-old son couldn't make the Rudolph squeak on his own though. But he did like the sound when I would do it.
1,Poor quality - very disappointing,"I had a Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer Little Golden Book growing up in the 70's and loved it (and my other Little Golden Books). This book, however, is nothing like the quality books they once were. First, it is at best 2/3 the size of the old little golden books. The cardboard is cheap, thin, and the book is not traditionally bound (all glue, it LOOKS like something meant to be used a few times and discarded - like something you'd pick up on a street corner in Beijing). It completely lacks charm. My kids agree - they have no interest in reading this book because the cover is hard to open, the text is crammed onto the small pages, and there are so many better alternatives."
3,The story everyone knows,"This is a pretty straightforward telling of the classic story, which has taken a firm hold on the American publish as an integral component of the Santa Claus tradition.I suppose that this is as good a rendition as anything out there, and that every child should have the Rudolph story, so in that sense, I recommend this book. However, I'm not sure that there's anything intrinsically valuable about this story.But what's interesting about this edition to me is that the pictures are done by Richard Scarry, who has published a long line of terrific books under his name in the years since this came out."
1,"remember this is the ""old"" version...","Having not seen the orginal Rudolph TV show in a very long time I forgot what the story line was... remember that in this version of the story the snowman eats reindeers and apparently elves or anything else that would be upsetting to a child. There are a couple of scary illustrations in this book. My 3 year old was in love with the Rudolph movie but once he saw this book he refused to ever have anything to do with Rudolph again because he said he ""didn't like the scary snowman"". Yes, I know it's a classic, but be warned."
1,Bigotry Among Reindeer -- I Have Never Liked This Story,"The first time I saw this movie, I was four. I disliked it intensely and thought it was too sad.First, we have the bigotry among the reindeer. They were prejudiced against any deer whose nose wasn't jet black.Then, we have poor little Herbie, the aspiring dentist whose toothy dolls with donkey teeth just aren't catching on.Lastly, we have the Island of Unwanted Toys. I found that part so upsetting. To this day, I remember saying, ""I don't like this part. The island is where you go when you're bad, like a hospital."" (This was during the days when tonsillectomies were a dime a dozen). That part always made me sad and in the few times I watched this movie or read the story, I would always leave on that part.No, I didn't like this story under any conditions. I liked it better when Santa only had 8 reindeer, Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Cupid, Donder, Blitzen, Comet."
4,"Good book, but...","I purchased this book along with Sammy's Mommy Has Cancer because my mom has been diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer. This book does help to explain what is going on with a cancer patient. My girls (2 & 3) and I can somewhat identify with it because we play ""tickle monster."" My girls seemed to like the book (but not as well as Sammy's Mommy Has Cancer), because we have read it more than once, but I feel that it had quite a few words for kids the same ages as mine. My 3-year-old also wanted to know what was wrong with the peoples' eyes, because of the way they were drawn. Kudos to those who worked to put this book out there, it is a good tool to help to explain a somewhat difficult subject."
2,Save your money,I purchased this video because I liked Ryan Merriman when he was on the TV series Veritas. He must have been desperate for money when he signed onto this dog of a movie.
5,Grand finale for a grand teen series,"This is the fourth, and final book in this Circle of Friends series. What I really like about this book is that there are discussion questions in the back of the book--which opens the door to discussing pertinent issues in a Christian teen's life. For example, ""Nicole's parents refuse to allow her to date someone who is not a Christian. Do you think that this is fair?"" Parents, youth group leaders, may want to read these books along with their teen(s,) so they can talk about these issues that come up in the relationships in the book. In this way teens can safely apply the questions and consequences in their own relationships. Buy the whole series for a teen in your life."
3,New Polymer Clay Book on the Market,"I recently discoverd this book by David Kracov and had to purchase it to see how close I could come to duplicating his sculpting technique. So far I am very happy with the results, and considering the fact that he uses a clay that I have not used in the past, I consider this a good selling point for his book. I would not recommend this book for someone just getting into clay sculpting as he leaves out some vital information (or so I believe) and some of his instructions are very vague. But if you've learned the basics of sculpting characters from another source or are a natural artist, I think you should be able to glean some very useful design concepts from this book. Mr. Kracov is very talented and I hope he publishes another book soon. I will be watching and waiting for one."
5,"i-clay, Fimo, Plasticine Art","I purchased this book for my daughter, who likes to makei-clay figures.It is a very good book, with explanations and photos of how to work with the material.However, there are only 4 or 5 figures. (I thought there would be more)They are very complex figures. (not sure it fits a 12 years old child)Since a new book is very expensive, I decided to buy a used one, and I'm very pleased. It's in great condition."
5,BOOK,ENJOYED EVERY MINUTE I SPENT THUMBING THRU THE PAGES CAUSE ONLY TIME I CAN READ IT LATE NITE AND LTELY I HAVE GONE TO BED AROUND NOW-NITE-NITE AND THANKS FOR THE FUN
4,Good tutorial book,Lot of great tips and easy instructions included.Keeps a lot of the steps simplified for even a begiiningclay artist to follow.
3,From what I have heard,"I have only heard the samples provided above, but I can say that this work is inspirational."
4,A classic must own series for every child,"As a child I loved reading the Golden Book series and to this day I still have most of my originals. As a new father, these books make excellent educational reading gifts. Your child will undoubtedly cherish them for many years"
1,Stressful Return,"I returned this for an exchange on December 8th and I have not received the item or my money back as of yet. I have emailed the Seller, which was TV Store Online, twice and they never responded. Very poor customer service."
2,Numbing.,"Though well-crafted, this book is ultimately rather one-dimensional - a 750-page litany of victimization. Shilts' sledgehammer approach and simplistic 1970s identity politics may make for effective propaganda, but that's about it. This book sorely lacks the nuance and intelligence of Allan Berube's ""Coming Out Under Fire"" - still the best book yet published on this subject."
5,First celtic buy,"I think these folks need to put out another CD. This is definitly on my top 10 favorite cd list. It doesn't get old after a couple listens and sounds better every time it's played. A remarkable richly textured accidental buy from my record club, but what an accident (or was it)!"
5,"Allied Plastic Heated Pet Bowl, 5-Quart","I use this bowl in the winter for my chickens. It is hands down better than a heated chicken waterer, it is more durable and the higer sides keep the water cleaner and I honestly believe the chickens prefer it to the ones designed for them. The added bonus, it is approxamately a 20% savingsAllied Plastic Heated Pet Bowl, 5-Quart"
2,Bad workmanship,I was disapointed in the quality.Boards that do not fit properly.Very bad instructions.Ive seen better wood working from a sith grade class.
4,interesting survey of a few games over 100 years,"Different type of baseball book, discussing about a dozen moments over 100 years. devoting a chapter to each perfect game.Each chapter includes lots of background information and a description of the actual game.The author has an interesting connection to perfect games -- he saw the David Cone performance at Yankee stadium with his son.Very well written, and enjoyable."
5,The Dash Between the Dates,"This book helped me understand the importance of wisely choosing how I spend my time. Reading it opened my eyes to the importance of not letting time fly by without thought of its eternal value. It brought me to an understanding of God's ultimate plan for my life and how I must spend my time, the dash between my birth date and the date of my death, developing a personal relationship with Him and storing up eternal treasures. This is a life-changing read and I highly recommend it."
5,Excellent!,This book was purchased as a gift & I was worried that it might not be in the best condition. But I was very pleased - it was in excellent condition!! I would definitely buy from this seller again.
2,HISOH,"THAT yelling is so kool he's got a master piece here for sureits so good , i love theim'sRichard yelling gives you ventodemits like a artuig that likes to maercs at you but i really love it , its fablous"
3,Slight but informative,"Clocking in at 124 pages you can't expect an indepth treatment of each of the candidates but I can see this being useful for anyone who hasn't been thinking about the 2004 election since 2002. All the candidates are represented -- even Bob Graham who dropped out -- and each is subjected to a quick profile that includes policy flip flops, best and worst moments, biographical information and some analysis of their positions. Instead of some recycled Slate.com content, I would have preferred a little more new analysis but this after all is meant as a quick and dirty guide to the people gunning for the big chair in 2004, not an encyclopedia."
1,Should be called the Ultimate Let Down,I have been weight training since I was 15. This book just lists basic weight training exercises every weight trainer does. I found nothing and I mean nothing new or different that is specific for a triathlete. Its just a weight training book with a triathlete sticker slapped on the front. Dont' waste your money Google is better.
1,Nothing new,Any basic triathlon book will give you weight training ideas as good as these. Google is probably better.
5,thanks,"I never thought I could or would run a triathlon, but this book really helped me train. It was a great guide and plan for the winter, and hopefully I'll be able to compete in the spring. Without this I'd be lost."
3,Old Country Roses Carving Tools,This set is very lovely and goes perfectly with my Old Country Roses English Bone China.The problem I had with this set is that the carving knife is very dull and I had a great deal of trouble finding someone who would sharpen it for me. The knife is very sharp now but they scarred the knife badly in the process.
3,Historical view of Kabbalah,"Speaking mainly in a historical sense, the author discusses many of the concepts that have developed in the study of Kabbalah. The concepts are not written about to be understood, only where they have developed. The author presents his material in a very objective way without any noticeable bias toward one system or another. Don't expect to walk away from this and be on the road to enlightenment. However, with that said, I do think it is important to the student of Kabbalah to understand the roots of the matter. This book does nicely in this respect. One should not start on the mystic road unless one knows who cleared the trees and laid the gravel."
2,Not very helpful for a traveler,"I was hoping this would be a good overview of things to see on my trip in Hong Kong. But it didn't really offer much information.The host is nice enough, but there wasn't much info about things to see, places to go, what to expect, etc...If you're looking for something to help plan your trip. Save your money. On the other hand, the Frommers guide is quite helpful."
4,Today and Tomorrw,Book is great for anyone who is interested in Project Management or just manufacturing and life lessons in all. This book teaches one so many different things that it's hard to say where to classify it under. Put it under the must read section. Jdv.
4,"Good CD, but the Song Choice Ain't The Best","Nicole is amazing!!! But, like Jaci Velasquez she's missing a few hits. I think to myself why does she have two live songs instead of her hits ""Witness"" and ""Everyday People"". I mean those got on the WOW Hits CDs. And if she really wanted a live song why not her hit ""Victory Chant"" which was on WOW Worship (Red)? She is truly an amazing singer! She has so many beatiful songs like ""Call On Jesus"", ""Come Unto Me"", ""Music of My Heart"", ""Talk About It"" and the title track. And it was very clever to have her ""End of the Spear"" song ""Always Love You"". Pretty good CD, but missing a couple hits."
5,Unbelievable gift this young lady has been blessed with,I just can't say enough about this CD. It is simply awesome. The selection is varied and all top notch.
4,Broken case,I was VERY disappointed this CD was not packed very well. The CD case was practically crushed in the corner of the CD. The CD does work just fine.
5,Lots of variety,"I'm a big fan of ""Best of"" or ""Greatest Hits of"" CD's, because it gives you the most bang for your buck (I don't own an IPOD). I just love some of Nicole's songs but didn't want to buy an entire CD for one or two singles. There are two versions each of ""Reedemer"" and ""Call on Jesus"", one studio version and one live. I love them both. The most surprising thing was the variety of music Nicole has on this CD - slow, fast, hip-hop, rap. But the core message remains the same - loving and praising the Lord."
5,This CD is awesome,"This is a great CD. I play it often. Some of the songs really energize me when I'm driving. When I'm at a red light, I really ""get down."" Some great worship songs too."
3,OK,This will be able to help some people learn the basics of the Arabic alphabet.You will definitely need a much more comprehensive study program if you need to use the language for any practical purpose. This program might come in handy if you use it in conjunction with a grammar book.
3,cute shoe,Don't buy if you are looking for comfort. There is no support at all. Not the best made shoe somewhat disappointed about that. I do like the way it looks. And I will wear them.
3,From the back cover:,"Prince Jefri of Bahania had just been bested by a woman. And not just any female, but Billie Van Horn, his gorgeous, take-noprisoners flight instructor who was more than a match for this ultramasculine male. Well, she might be an ace in the aire, but when it came to romance, Billie was determined to keep both feet on the ground. So why did the sexy sheik make her feel as if she were soaring high above the clouds? She knew that when royal honor called, her high-born lover would fly from her side forever - unless Jefri defied his destiny and chose love.Watch how passion flares under the hot sun for this rogue sheik"
5,This Book Should Be On The New York Times Best Seller List!,"I loved this book! Written by a truly Southern writer drawing on her heritage, Sometimes There's A Dove is an absolutely fabulous read that you can - and I certainly did! - get lost in. It chronicles the life of a little girl growing up in the South during the late 1930's - early 1940's. It is fabulous, and I'm looking forward to more books by Cynthia Ward. It's been a long time since I've enjoyed a book this much."
5,Great Floor Cleaner,"First of all I am allergic to fragences, but this lemon scented if very mellow! Also, the cleaner work great because you do not have to rise the product off and it shines!"
5,Great product,"This is a great product for the new flooring in my new mobiles. And it actually smells good also. Thanks, Judy"
3,"good product, bad service",this is the second time I have ordered this porduct. The product is good. I received it in a timely manner the first time I ordered a few months ago. This past experience was just the opposite. I ordered it March 13th and after an email to the distributor and a complaint I finally received it almost 3 1/2 weeks later.
2,ink yeild,"Sorry very disapointed I only got 280 copies out of my ink cartridge .When I purchased my Cannon 1000 Printer I was told I would get approx. 1000 copies,when I got home and read the manual it said 500 O.K. but I only got 480. am disapointed"
1,ink cartridge,I ordered and paid for a new cannon ink cartridge. I was sent a refilled viking ink cartridge. Not new! Not Cannon! I got less than I paid for. Sent it back and have not recieved credit yet and it's been over 2 weeks.
5,WOW,I can't believe how fast I received this order. I just hope there isn't any difference in the BC-02 and BC-01 -- lol
1,"Re-manufactured Ink Leaked, Ruined Printer!","The ink cartridge had been installed for about two weeks when found leaking. Printer is ruined. Forced to buy a new one. Never bought re-manufactured ink cartridges before. Purchased these, Canon BC-02 Black Ink cartridges, because the Canon ink is very difficult to find. Good bye to what had been good printer!"
4,what I have to say about Master Strokes,The book master strokes was very well. It made some very good points about how lots of people need to know there boundries in golf as well as there own relationships with god. Some people cant hit the long ball but are excelent putters. So people cant preach but can support and pray for the ones who can. I think the book helped me realize what I can do to evangelize and have more fun within my own boundries. Over all I think this book was excellent
3,A Fading Golden Oldie,Lewis Wolpert is one of the scientific community's great communicators. This book was a classic in promoting public scientific literacy to an earlier generation. It still has much to offer but has faded due to lack of revision and lack of illustration. I think if Lewis Wolpert gave this book 3 days revision and added some of the beautiful pictures available on embryological development at his disposal it would speak again to a new generation. Perhaps he could give it to an aspiring young colleague who he trusts with its revision if he has not the time. I also think he would be kinder as he has aged to former generations of researchers for the ideas that turned out to be incorrect. He has been an absolutely outstanding author preparing the way for the current Evo Devo revolution.
3,Great Customer Service!!!,"I am a HUGE fan of the VHS version of this instructional resource, but the DVD version has very grainy video quality and bad audio. You will be better served to buy the VHS version. It is a shame, because this is the BEST resource for slapping on the planet. UPDATE: Video Progressions contacted me and exchanged my bad DVD for a fresh one. The new copy loks and sounds PERFECT! Thanks Video Progressions!!"
1,masterpiece,"I haven't gone through the whole DVD yet but I've learned more from this than any other resource..... it's excellent, he really breaks things down and takes the mistry out of those licks that you never thought you'd get :-)"
5,One of the best purchases that I ever made.,"The Slap Bass Program with Alexis Sklarevski is an excellent video. I wish I had bought this video ten years ago. I've always had problems with my slap bass style and this video has already helped me to iron out my problems. It starts you off with the very basics, the a b c's and this has helped me eradicate the problems that I had with slap bass technique. The video then progresses into some very complex styles. I have had this video for about a month now and I am just about a quarter way into the video, there is just so much here to learn and practice. Excellent product, I got my money's worth. My one gripe is that I wish that this product came as a DVD."
1,I feel deceived.,"I thought this was a CD, not a book.. oh well.. i will be sure next time to determine, but the picture looks like a DVD. not much time for reading.."
3,Children of the End,"I was disappointed in the quality, compared to the advertisement - will probably not use this particular service again. I've used other services which always exceeded my expectations - this one didn't. The contents of the book are exceptional though."
5,Mind blowing book!,"Clements is one of the most innovative and original writers of his genre. CHildren of the End, may start slowly but once you get a few chapters into it... Look out! A non-stop roller coaster ride of thrills and chills awaits. I loved everything about this book. The prose, dialog, pacing was first class. THe characters unique and inventive. The monsters on the other hand (without giving too much away) will make you never look at television or religion the same way again. Clements has a lot of ambition by combining horror, suspense, and science fiction and he gets away with it to create one of the best books I've read in the past decade"
3,Lighted Tetris is a let down.,"Slightly larger than the pocket version of Tetris, I was very disappointed in this version. The hand controls are almost impossible to use and there are 4 controls now! Too many. The plastic cover is nice, but for kids it will most likely break off in no time. The light feature is nice, but since it's so difficult to play, it will probably not get much use."
2,Not a good repair manual.,"Its not complete. Lots of maintenance/parts replacement omitted, one example is the coolant flange. Only contains very basic things."
1,waste of time,Do yourself a favor and buy a bentley manual and not this. A little better than the users manual that came with the car.
2,Old Tarzan Fan,"When I was a young man, I liked to see Tarzan in the movie. I think it was Less Barker, who played Tarzan. He was the right Tarzan for me. Unfortunately he is not on this DVD. But Gordon Scott, who followed, is onone movie. He is ok. The other Tarzans on this DVD are before my time.Unfortunately is this DVD in black and white and I misordered 2. I hope tofind some in colour from 1960-1970.Best regards from Birger Lundsfryd, Denmark."
3,Tarzan No,"I'm a Gordon Scott fan, his Tarzan's were the ones I remember from my childhood. I thought he was the 'ideal' Tarzan, but unfortunately they don't have his good color versions available on Amazon. The funny thing is that the famous Tarzan yell is Weismuller, not any of those after him. I do think his Jungle Jim movies were good, but again, if you want good Tarzan you need to find ""Tarzan's' Big Adventure"" with Gordon Scott."
5,Awesome!!!,"This laptop is so awesome. I've always had a desktop, so I'm excited that I was able to purchase a laptop at such an inexpensive price. First of all, it's advertised as having 512MB RAM and a 40GB hard drive. Well, I got 1G of RAM and a 60 GB hard drive. Secondly, it works so well, as if it's new. And thirdly, for this to have been a refurbished computer, it looks good with very little to no scratches. Several people's comments have not been to pleasing, but I would blame the seller, not the laptop. I didn't purchase the cheapest one. I read all of the sellers' comments and chose the one I thought would give me an honest buy. I am very happy with my purchase."
2,Product good but Do not buy it from BRAVTEK,Decent product however I bought the laptop from BRAVTEK and I got cheated on the deal. He sold me a defective product and refused to fix it. Be careful shopping for laptops and by all means avoid the above vendor.
4,great for school,"I adore mine.I'm not a gamer or anything of the sort, I just use mine for internet purposes and college, and it's perfect. It lags a bit, which is annoying, but should be expected with the low price. Overall, I like it a lot."
3,Functionable Laptop,"I got this thing used a few years ago; now, I'm a 16 year-old, and my primary use for computers is writing, storing my photos, and gaming. This laptop is pretty decent (especially for the price) for the first two of my purposes, but for gaming, it was way, way below par. We had to buy numerous upgrades for it to even run World of Warcraft on top of my pictures (they take up a lot of memory).BOTTOM LINE: If you're looking for a low-key laptop and you don't need much memory, this is a nice little piece of hardware."
5,del,"this computer is working great, my cousin is happy with, it has a lot of programs and he is using them, thanks"
3,Review of Dell D600 laptop,"I was happy to get the computer, and it was packaged securely and safely, and it arrived timely.However, it came to me with the wrong power cord.I weighed the cost + time involved for me to contact the company to resend the correct cord vs just simply ordering one from someone else. It was just more cost effective for me (time and money) to simply order one from a local company."
1,Computer was not capable of being internet and media ready,"We bought this for our daughter who's going to college this summer. It was to have all the bells and whistles so nothing was needed... She opened on christmas morning and couldn't connet to the internet, couldn't listen to music and couldn't watch a dvd. We will now have to pay just as much to get it up to speed as it was to buy the computer in the first place. Very sad considering it took all we had to get this for her! One income house hold and 6 kds to buy for, getting a laptop at a discount was a dream and as dreams do, they disappear."
3,good,Its good I would recommended it.great for the price and in great condition you should buy it.screen was good not a scrach on it
4,My Latitude,"I got this Latitude at a fair price,the laptop is fairly old but it works fine I have put upgrades in it and the system runs well(somewhat slow)but for the age of this laptop I am more than happy with it and glad I made this purchase!!!"
1,dissatisfied,"I am totaly dissatisfied by the product recently purchased. The discreption was given about the product on the web isn't much after I purchased it. I purchased the laptop for my brother lives in Africa, so I sent the laptop to him as soon as I received. he said the laptop doesn't work at all. I used to trust Amazon very well. I purchased many products before, everything was accurate. If I had the product with me, I would have returned. I advised the company to put the correct information about the product to avoid lose of customer.Thanks,Mulugeta Damamo"
1,Dell D600 purchase,"This laptop was supposed to be a Christmas present for my 10 yr old. It didn't work fully for the disc drive didn't work and the video card was outdated. I ended up having to buy a new one for my son, and donated this laptop to St Vincent DePaul of Tucson . I am very dissatisfied for my son was devastated. I feel that something should be done for me because of this! Tyvm"
2,Dell D600,Seems to lockup a lot.And has since day one.Thats it.Dont know why you need to fill in so many words to fill this out
1,my laptop where is it,i have not recived it yet i have been waiting on it i was wonder where was it i have not got nothing yet
1,Should have cancelled when i had the chance.,"It took two weeks longer than planned to get the computer delivered and I have always had problems with it: to slow, couldn't connect to some websites, and some of the keys fell off shortly after I received it, but I thought that it was so cheap that I could handle a few problems. Now I cannot even get onto my work website to check my schedule and the time is almost up for signing up for insurance with my job and since I can't get onto the website from this computer I have to go into work early and use their computer. So I have to leave my son early to do this, and being a working single mom any time that I get to spend with him is precious. So thank you for nothing."
4,Solid System,"I purchased this for my daughter who is a junior in college.It has a Solid System and Enough Good Hard Drive Space.Its not for Gamers, Its for your Education."
2,slow,"slow,, battery does not charge so you have to keep it plugged in and you can't up grade the system at all but hey you get what you pay for"
4,ALMOST PERFECT,I LOVE ITS SIZE AND POSITIONING OF EVERYTHING AND THE LARGE PRINT. I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS - ITS GREAT! I JUST WISH THERE WERE MANUALS. OH WELL!
2,Stay away from this laptop...,"This is one of the worst laptops ever made. Its a tempting price but not worth the hassle afterwords. First you should know that Dell came out with several more models later because this one had major hardware issues. The internal on-board ethernet/wifi chip or card will go bad in a few months, the signal would get shorter and shorter. There's a major battery chip problem as well which was supposedly fixed in later models. Hard drive problems, audio problems ...horrible.Just stay away, buy anything else but this."
1,dissappointed,"This computer sucks, the dvd drive does not work, I had to buy a special internet card plus an ethernet cable to get the internet to work, It does not have wifi and now the computer wont even turn on, it flashes a blue screen then keeps starting over. It does this repeatedly. I tried to have someone fix it, but it would not even open in safe mode."
2,Dell d600,Didn't realize until avg was installed that it was missing standard drivers.Slow moving. Overall not crazy about it. But it is an older laptop.
3,my dell laptop experience,the all over apperance of the computer was great however the speed was slow battery life not so great and the mouse started going out only after a few days guess thats why they sent a mouse with it.. other than that the seller was great and had great communications skills.. would recommend people buy from this seller there great goodluck
5,Very Nice,I got this for my fiance's Bday and he loved it. We had a couple of issues with it but the sellers were very polite and helped us out very quickly fixing the problems. Customer service was great and he loves using the computer. There has been no issues with it since and it works great.
2,sellers= good...products= fair,"Its not a bad laptop at all, my only disapointment is that it wont play dvd's, a file or program is missing. This was a letdown because I take long bus trips and wanted various ways to spend my time.It was a low price, In a way I wish I would have waited and got a more up to date laptop, but hey its still new to me.It is rather sluggish at times, it could have something to do with hot spots.I think I was exspecting more, but hey it was only $240.00 and it is 6 yrs oldat the time I was desperate, and you get what you pay for.one good thing it arrived fast, and I was able to track it."
1,"Huge EMF, No Support From Seller","The laptop that I was sold in general is fine. However, (as maybe is typical for Dell computers), there is a huge EMF that is puts out; horrible for health ([...]). I in paticular have a GI health problem that it makes much worse.The seller. I asked for a refund. No reply (after some days now). I would not buy from this person in the future."
1,worthless laptop.,This Laptop was worthless for the day I got it. everything was erased on it to make it look good. it already had a virus when I got it. very slow. I was suppose to send it back to the seller at my expense. it was expensive enough for a used worthless laptop and on top of that I was going to spend more money sending it back with no guarentee that I was going to have another.
1,Rip off !!,"We purchased a used dell laptop on 11/27/10 for 204.00 and all we had was trouble with it .It was covered with scatches & dents, the mouse didn't work properly,the screen was so dim you could hardly see what your working on.So I ran the recovery disk that was provided to fix the problem's and the computer froze up solid.My 14 year old daughter was then without a christmas gift. I just don't think it is fair that this happened.Anyway I scrambled into action and purchased a new acer netbook for her as this was all I could afford.It wasn't what she wanted so her xmass was wrecked!To top it off i've yet to recieve a refund & i'm stuck with a spare battery & cable for 30 bucks.Thats a total of 234.00.With the 300 I spent + 234 I lost I could have made her day.Instead I was the rat.I will never buy from discount 18 again.Robert Fletcher : As of 12/27/10 i'm still waiting for a refund."
1,DEL D600 LAPTOP 40 GB HARD DRIVE,I have not received this Laptop yet and want my Money back NOW!!!! I have been using Amazon.com for years but this is the first time I have not gotten my Item. If I do not have my money back on my Visa you will be having leagle actions taken!!Walterene Morgan
2,dell,"Don't waste your time spend a hundred dollars more for a much better machine.They sent a recovery disk without a product key.You would do better to build your own with parts of other machines than to buy from these people.I will never make apurchase with them,again"
2,Not so great,"My laptop arrived with obvious signs of use, a non-functioning AC adapter, and no frills whatsoever... such as installation disks or user manuals. All you get is the laptop and a power cable (that didn't work, in my case). It was cheap, though."
1,DONT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY,"I order a $153.oo computer from this company on Dec 2, they took my money from my account. It is Jan 2 and I have yet to recieve my computer. They have also changed their company name from 5 Stars llc. to Radaration since I sent my first email. BEWARE!"
5,Amazing product looks exactly like the picture,"I was flabbergasted by the price. After I received it I learned it has a built in wifi capability i connected to my wireless router without having to add an additional attachment. looks exactly like the image. no scratches, dings, anything, It came on the 31st dont expect it any earlier though. Worth the purchase i'm going to buy one for my girlfriend!!!! this is a real post if you dont believe this testimonlal lolololol ahahahahaha xDDDD"
4,GOOD SCHOOL LAPTOP,THT IS WOULD BE A GOOD LAPTOP FOR ANY STUDENT READIALY CONNECTS TO INTERNET ENOUGH SPACE FOR YOUR PAPERS.NANCY SANTA ROSA
1,Returning this Laptop It was overrated.,"I 'm not pleased at all, laptop shuts of every 5minutes. Now I have to spend additional $15.00 to ship it back I'm dissapointed. I want my $$$ back."
1,DONT BUY THIS COMPUTER,"I got this computer for Christmas and it is horrible. My keys are popping off and the computer is super slow and freezes up all the time. Do not buy this computer at all. I wish that I new how this computer was going to turn out because if I was the one who bought it I would have not purchased this at all. This computer is out of day and it will delete things as well. An sometimes I cannot turn it on. Also, I have to leave it charged up because the person who I got this from sold my a crappy battery. So I will be looking for a new computer and it will not be one like this."
3,Dell Laptop,My daughter was quite surprised to get her laptop computer. She started using it right away and now I can't get her off of it.
2,a little disappointing...,"I was really looking forward to getting my Pedrini Mezzaluna. I've been in the market for a good mezzaluna for a while, and when I was unable to find one with two handles and two blades, I settled for this one.I've used mine twice now, both times with disappointing results. The blade isn't very sharp and it's very difficult to find balance due to the way the tool is constucted.Also, the mezzluna comes with know instrutions for care whatsoever.I am seriously considering returning this producting and resuming my search."
2,get a double bladed one instead,Try Williams-Sonoma for their double bladed mezzaluna- much better than this one!
3,It's basically hockey tape!,"I thought this was a larger version of the waterproof band-aid material you would find at your local pharmacy store but it is exactly the kind of tape I use to tape my ankles up before a hockey game.I bought a roll of it to keep my nicotine patches on while I do lap swimming at my local pool. I bought it for $8 bucks but I could have bought it much cheaper at my local hockey shop.To stay on point though, It works as waterproof tape but as expected leaves a sticky residue that is tough do get off afterwords.It would work fine if you had a cast on your leg or arm or even stitches where you need to tape a plastic bag over the cast or wound so you can take a quick shower."
5,Will Use Again,"I used this tape to wrap the arches of my feet for Tough Mudder. I needed something that would last for at least 3 hours in thick mud and a great amount of water/swimming. Despite all of the grit that got in my shoes, this tape did not unravel throughout my entire race. I highly recommend this tape, especially if you are used to just using regular Mueller athletic tape!"
3,Ball,This was a decent gift. I do not think I can write twelve words o. This product decent craft for kids
3,blah,"If you need this for a class but want an older edition, go for it. Almost all the research is 30+ years old. Also, I'm all for women empowerment, but this book is definately biased and makes the research conclusions unreliable. There are better options out there."
3,good,The book came quickly and in good order. It was cheap enough that I didn't have to spend a ton of money on books this semester.
2,The Devil Scene gave my toddler a nightmare,"this movie was decent...it tries to go from Isaiah's prophecies to the Ascention in 28 minutes so the scenes are all very short so you get a decent overview but you don't get to go deep in any part of Jesus' life. Also, there was a scene with Jesus in the wilderness when the devil comes to tempt him that is kinda intense for a child. The devil was a very scary grim reaper type of character and my toddler acutally woke up 3 times the night after we watched it scared from the images of the devil. Animation is better than some other videos out there, but I probably won't let my child watch again till he's older and I will probably fast forward through the devil scene."
1,Disappointed,"Quite disappointing! The stories move so fast that it leaves out important detail from the biblical account. The story appears to be based on a modern interpretation of the bible instead of the more classic King James version. Some important parts of the stories of the Savior are not even depicted. They use very stereotypic depictions of Satan, Judas Iscariot. Satan reminds me of the Grinch with green skin, dagger-like finger nails and red eyes. My 6 year old grandson even said, ""...that's not the way the bible tells the story."" To me it doesn't matter if some children like it if it's innacurate."
1,Totally inaccurate!,"I bought this movie for my kids and I was sorely disappointed. It has many inaccuracies. If you want to know the REAL story of Jesus, please read your Bible. Don't purchase this for your family."
2,Not great,"Kids didn't like this one much. It was pretty dry, no humour, nothing to strike their attention. They did not like it."
5,The kids love it,i wanted something that was not from the Nest Group. I did'nt want to support the Mormans. This was cute and gripping for the kids and adults.
2,Drives Parents crazy,"Being a Christian, I wanted to have this for my granddaughter. She is 2 and she loved it for a while but it drove my daughter crazy. Miss Pattycake spends her whole time staring at the camera and I would not want to be a kid doing a show with her. She seems overly whatever. Annoying for adults, loved by 2 year olds."
1,No ac information,Never again will I buy a book without loo0king first. What no information to fix car here
3,Better than nothing,"This book is organized in a way that I do not think is logical, other wise if you are going to replace the engine this book would be a good choice."
1,AC plugs break off quickly,"The first one broke off the AC plug the first time I tried to push it into the AC socket. The company did send me a second one after few emails and phone calls, but that one only lasted couple of months and AC plugs broke off."
2,Was looking for the music...,Heard a couple of cuts from this on Pandora and decided to purchase.Love the music but the recordings are less than desirable.
4,fresh italian songs,this a new italian folksinger native of piedmont near the french border. he is a station-master with a great sense of humor and really enjoyable lyrics. this is his second album recorded in france because he wasn't allowed to publish it in italy . he won a national song contest - festival di castrocaro - and he signed for a record company that forced him to write a different kind of songs...after refusing he moved to paris where after becoming quite popular he recorded his first album. if you're looking for a genuine italian product miles awy from the stereotypes this is your man.
1,Nothing to do with Gunsite,This books has little or nothing to do with Jeff Cooper's famous Gunsite training range and appears to rely only on that famous connection to sell itself. Do not be fooled. Most of the stories are reprints from other sources and vary from histories of the old west to modern times. Cooper's personal philosophy is much in evidence but few of the stories are actually about shooting and those which deal with hunting are few in number. As someone who admires Cooper's other books I feel like I was trapped into buying this one as it is both mediocre and boring and I wound up just leafing through looking for the few good stories it contains. Not worth it.
2,Disjointed,"While there are a few good essays in this book, the whole is disjointed. For fans of Cooper it'll be an insight into the man they will likely enjoy."
4,So it's on DVD in America!,"A few years ago, I drove about 25 miles especially to buy this movie (used, on VHS) from Blockbuster. I wanted to see everything Heath Ledger had ever acted in, and I couldn't find Two Hands anywhere else.I'm not a big fan of black comedies, but this is a pretty good one. There are some funny bits (particularly the parts with Heath's character's dead brother--Jimmy?), some intriguing bits (parallelism between a couple characters, for instance), and some nice little pieces of continuity in the plot (the way the plot traveled actually reminded me a little of the movie Go).I'm glad I got the movie and watched it, but I don't think I'm going to buy the DVD; I may even sell my videotape. I just don't watch the show that often, and I'm not sure I want my kids to have access to a show this dark & violent at a very young age."
2,Two Hnads movie,I was so exited to get this movie....then the last 15 minutes of the DVD were damaged and unwatchable...so disappointing. I went to youtube and watched clips of the final scenes.
3,Two Hands,I have collected all the Heath Ledger films since his unexpected and untimely death. This one was a bit odd for my tastes.
1,Not even Rose Byrne can save this,"A pathetic attempt at a gritty street life story with Heath Ledger playing a dim-witted working class man hoping to move up by working for gangsta Bryan Brown (who killed Ledger's older brother -- whose corpse occasionally talks to the camera! -- I kid you not!).The main reason this failed for me was that the criminal behavior of Ledger's character and of two young boys' somehow made them virtuous. If you like to root for stupid people, this is your film.I only rented this because I recently discovered Rose Bryne who has a supporting role as the love interest. This was not a promising start for that talented actress."
4,NEgotiations Book Review,"Its a good book for knowing the different topics that enroll the negotiation topics. The difference (and advantage) of this book instead others, is that meets various papers about negotiations, from important writters."
1,Terrible conditions,This was in very bad conditions as half of the book had water damage. Half of the book had wrinkled and stains of water damage. I would of preferred to pay more and get a book in good conditions.I was very disappointed.
2,Adult Student,"The book was in fair condition. The cover was ripped. I purchased the book 3 weeks prior to my class start date because the estimated shipping time was up to 14 days. It shipped sooner, which I was pleased with, but once my class started I found out I had ordered 1 of 2 parts of the required text books and I couldn't find the second book. I was unable to return the book because my 7 day return window had passed. I was not happy with the return policy. Other than that the transaction was satisfactory."
2,Needs Updating,"Not a very good textbook. Out of date material. Several passages in the book refer to predictions in 2010 which does not make for interesting reading in 2012. The real-world illustrations are somewhat helpful. There is no useful index. Order it on Kindle if you can so you can search for material. You won't miss anything in the Kindle version because the book is black and white which makes for a boring read compared to colorful textbooks filled with illustrations, pictures, charts, graphs, and case studies. Most of the illustrations are merely filler and serve no useful purpose. This book needs a major overhaul. Universities can surely find better textbooks to use. One of the most boring textbooks I have read."
3,Less than Pleased,"Book was functionable, no pages were missing and very few highlights. However the cover was pretty badly worn and the corner of the first ten pages was ripped. I would have expected the book to be in better condition given the price."
2,This is great Salsa that desrves better remastering.,"This was an early Sonora Poncena release and includes some great tunes like ""Pano De Lagrimas"", ""Na Na"" and ""Africa"". Vocalists Luigui Texidor and Tito Gomez give some dynamite performances here and the band's musicians give it their all. Unfortunately, the sound quality is appaling--it's all too obvious that this CD was not made from the master tapes but from a worn-out LP. Great Sonora Poncena music...horrible-sounding CD."
4,quick read!!,For all those looking for the why of life bia has been there done that. love don;t bring love if you don;t love.
4,"Frankly, I was disappointed","I expected a book that would move me emotionally as well as intellectually, like Abby's Desert Solitude. That's not what this book is all about. It is well written, yes, but it only shoots for the intellect, not the heart, or at least it did for me. It is still an important read."
2,buyer beware,I am informed by an expert on Aldo Leopold's writings that this edition contains editing by the publisher which introduced a scientific error in the treatment of evolution. The editors replaced some of Leopold's words with their own.
3,Required reading,"Was assigned as required reading for a college class, found I actually enjoyed it. Good narrative in daily journal form, paints a lovely picture of a snapshot in time. Good read for anyone interested in conservation or natural resources."
5,PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF THIS BOOK,"I am a long time student of Leopold's Sand County Almanac. I am also fortunate to have Michael Sewell, the photographer of October 2001 edition, as a friend. I witnessed the dedication and the results produced by his efforts. Michael closely researched the places talked about by Leopold and photographed them in a way that deepens the experience and the understanding of the reader of Sand County. Ken Brower, son of David Brower, provides a wonderful introduction. Together, Sewell and Brower have honored the fact that this is Leopold's journey and message for all of us. I'm certain this will be the edition that stands the test of time."
5,Love Your Mother !,"This wonderful classic is required reading for residents of Mother Earth. In the endless quest for more profit, we are destroying the earth and it's become (unbelievably!) necessary to remind ourselves of the priceless gifts right under our feet. Profit can buy manmade Stuff, but the life giving sustenance and the matchless beauty of our lovely blue planet can't be bought and anything that can be bought is a pale and lifeless substitute for what we have at our finger (and toe-) tips.Love your Mother!Live Green!"
5,Corrected reveiw.,"Team player was more than helpful to correct the problem. Unfortuantely, since this was the first time that we had used Amazon and not sure how to handle a misunderstanding we gave them a rating of 1. They really are willing to correct problems.Sorry for the rating."
5,Simply the best,"Aldo Leopold wrote these famous words: ""There are those of us who can live without wild things and those of us who cannot."" For those of you who cannot, this is your book. Aldo Leopold was a great man like a great old tree, with roots anchored down to earth and an intellect branching out towards new ways of thinking and looking at the world. The combination results in keen observations highlighted by elegant prose. I usually can't read too far into this book without getting a lump in my throat."
5,Breathtaking Book!,"If you're looking for a Holiday gift, look no further! A Sand County Almanac, re-photographed by Michael Sewell, is a nature-lover's gem. I've seen earlier versions of A Sand County Almanac, both with sketches and photos (done in the 70's), and neither compares to this new edition. The photos are spectatular, and unlike earlier versions of the book, the explanations of the wildlife are captured by the photos. It's as if poetry is both literal and visual and unite to form a complete whole, giving the reader vivid clarity into Leopold's descriptions. This is a must-see for nature-lovers and Holiday shoppers alike! I know it's on my Holiday shopping list!"
3,A sand county Almanac: and sketches Here And there by Aldo Leopoid,was not a hard covered book recieved a paper back. I kept it only because I wanted to read it. arrived in good condition and in about 10 days
1,A San County Almanac,This book was required for class but I have not been able to find interest in the stories told by Aldo Leopold. The book can in good condition however the content is so isolated and depressing and in my opinion my textbook for Environmental Science class is much more recent and familiar with the issues of the world in 2012.
1,TERRIBLE TERRIBLE DO NOT READ,"This book is possibly the stupidest I have ever read! No story line....just some idiot writing about a bunch of b.s. It is unfortanuate how he views the human race on the same level as plants, animals, and dirt. Terrible book written by someone who was ignorant. AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID"
1,Read Better Books,"Had to read this book for school. I have definitely read better books. Leopold repeats things a lot in this book, and drags out the book. He manages to go on for over 5 pages about cutting down one tree. It was really hard to keep reading. He dragged the book out for endless pages."
5,"An eloquent portrait of Sand County, nature in our lives","A wonderful read--Leopold teaches us how to be more attuned to our environment and how to be a realistic conservationist. The essays are wonderful, and Leopold's tricks (such as narrating the history of Wisconsin through the cutting down of a tree, description in living color and surround sound) make the reader feel as if s/he is actually sitting with him as he tracks deer, watches geese, and recalls his youth and conservation ethic. A must read for anyone interested in the environment and the world around them!"
5,One of the loveliest books I ever read.,"Thoughtful, beautiful writing. Put a log or two on the fire, start a kettle of water for tea, and cozy up to this wonderful book. Pause between each chapter to watch the snowflakes fall outside your window."
5,I Really Enjoyed This Book!,"Sand County Almanac has always been one of my favorite environmental books, but this new edition is by far the best. Sewell's photos match Leopold's writing so perfectly that you feel like you're right there on the farm. The new introduction by Kenneth Brower gives lots of interesting information about how this edition was created. The design is clean and makes for easy reading. I would highly recommend this book, especially for those new to Leopold's writing and those who appreciate beautiful visuals!"
2,A Sandy Almanac,I purchased the book that is shown in the picture and received a totally different book.I'm not to happy that i didnt get the book it showed.
1,Cheap,The socks don't go over my ankles & the shipping costs were the same as the price of the socks. Not worth it.
2,They didnt really do anything,You may as well just buy a cheap pair of white socks and put some lotion on. Its really the same effect.
4,Kabbalah Explained,"I have been reading some primers on Kabbalah and most of those books are difficult to understand for a reader that is not well versed in Judaism.This book has been the exception.The best attribute of this book is that the author explains the sefirot in understandable terms. The connections and combinations of the sefirot are discussed effectively also.The Tree of Life diagrams were very helpful.The meditative visualizations have been an aid in calming the mind.The Glossary is excellent for explaining terms on the subject and the notes for each chapter are also very helpful.While this book is easy to understand its also one of those books that you need to keep handy and re-read it to fully appreciate the material in it.I wouldn't categorize this book as a ""primer"", its more detailed.I also recommend this book for a reader of any persuasion that wants to know what Kabbalah is and how it applies to everyday life in this age."
2,For Serious Students of the Somme Only,"I found this book of interest only as a contemporary description of the Somme battlefield as it existed shortly after the battle. The language used is poetic to be sure, but the description is repetitive and frankly a bit boring. There's only so many ways you can describe a tree-lined stream. The introductionary chapters contain a brief history of the battle of the Somme, and Masefield's tour guide makes up less than half the pages."
5,Awesome! A Dreamweaver MX User's Template Bible!,"As a Professional Website Designer/Developer, it is my job to make sure that I offer my clients a well designed website that they will not only be comfortable with, but proud of. Templates make things a lot easier - but not everyone knows how to use them.The best way that I've found to learn the ins and outs of Templates in Dreamweaver MX is this book. It is written in a language anyone can understand. It offers hands-on projects to show you, not just tell you, how things work. Whether you are an experienced Dreamweaver User or Website Developer, or a beginner, this book can walk you through the process of using templates to design your websites easily and effectively. It's insightful, well-thought-out, well-written, and an extremely useful tool that I would recommend to anyone at any level. Thanks Brad and Murray for writing this awesome book!"
2,DreamON,"I bought this book with some hesitation, but decided to give it a shot. I really want to learn more about templates, and be able to use them on future sites. What a big dissapointment!! I received the book today and just finished reading the majority of the book.I followed the examples, did the exercises, but to not much avail. The book makes vague references such as see previous chapters, when refering to instructions such as ""spawning child pages."" Rather difficult to understand!! Perhaps I will give it another try, but for now, I am going back to Dreamweaver 4 and the previous versions of templates.Definately not recommended!!"
5,Excellent!,"This was the third book by Adrian Plass I read and it's just as good, probably better than the others. The humour isn't quite as silly and it's much deeper. A wonderful, heartwarming book."
5,I LOVED IT!!!!!!!!,"Adrian Plass' Sacred Diaries are hilarious! I was concerned that the sequel would not be as good as the first, but my concerns were soon put to rest as I began to read the first few pages. I became very attached to all of the characters in the first book and was grateful to find them all there. Plass is a comical genius in my opinion. These books are laughter therapy for any Christian."
5,Great Pearl,"I got this for my girlfriend for Valentine's Day and she loves it. The pearl is very high quality and the price on Amazon was unbeatable. The chain is quite thin, but it's not too long and looks nice. Overall, I would recommend this pendant for anyone who wants something nice but is working on a limited budget."
3,"nice pans, poor packaging.","The pans works fine, but someone put made in china stickers on the bottom of the pans and they don't come off very easily. Does someone not know what these pans are used for?"
2,low price and low quality,"You cant do much more with these than boil an egg or some rice, the material will start to scrape off with a wooden spoon after the third use. Nice for temporary use, but you will probably need to get something with more quality eventually."
3,metro pans,These pots are ok. They are worth what I paid for them. Not a dime more. I would guess they will last a year.
3,Does the job,"It's really hard to find a 1 1/2 quart saucepan without buying a large, expensive set, so for my needs, this three-piece set works. This is the second time in about a year I've had to purchase the same set because the first set rusted and wore out rather quickly with a lot of use. If you're not a gourmet chef and just need something to get you by, this is the set for you."
5,Perfect for Student Travelers,"As a prospective AFS exchange student to Europe, I found this book to be of more help than any other. Student travelers don't have many books as resources; ""First Time Europe,"" while not geared exclusively toward students, has a wealth of information that is useful to us. What to pack, what to expect, places to stay, attitudes...they are all contained here. This is highly recommended to any student, or others who are on a tight budget and want the most for their money. Written with a perfect balance of anecdotes and practical information, the book is interesting as well as informative. Buy it, buy it, buy it!"
1,First Time Europe - Rough Guide,"As a European living in London I felt this book gave very misleading information. I would not recomend it to anyone. One example is to ""use McDonalds because the toilets are always clean"". Great... $5.00 to use the worst toilets in the UK after the ones in Trainspotting."
3,Nothing Special,"The information in this book is very general. If you have ever done any traveling and already know the basics (Passports, planes, trains), even if you haven't been to Europe, skip this book for something more detailed."
1,This is not widescreen,"Lackluster plot aside, please note that this DVD is a 4:3 aspect ratio.The widescreen version will have a silver moon in the background, the standard definition will have a green moon. Amazon is displaying the incorrect cover art for this DVD.It boggles my mind that DVDs are still stamped in anything but 16:10 minimum. I can't find a widescreen version anywhere on Amazon so buyer beware!"
4,i love this movie,"This muppet movie was hilarious, especially great for little kids. The previous ones had a few more classic muppet stuff in them, but this one was still great. It was more serious, too. But it's a really funny movie, and anyone would probably enjoy it, especially if you're already a fan."
3,For the kiddos.,"I can't say I was very disappointed with this film, because I wasn't expecting much of a movie. I am not really a fan of the Muppets and the only reason I saw this is because there was nothing else on.But anyway, Gonzo reckons he has a family from outerspace and he is right because they are looking for him! So then Miss Piggy, Kermit and Gonzo himself set out for a journey to look for the family beyond.......This totally has an all-star cast including Dave Goelz, Andie MacDowell, David Arquette, Rob Schneider and cameo's from Dawsons Creeks' Joshua Jackson and Katie Holmes.I totally recommend this for the kids, and it is pretty fun and cute, so older muppet-goers will enjoy it too!"
5,Gotta Love,Muppets what more needs to be said. Fun fuzzy creatures that will take you to a time animation was simple.
5,Finally Muppet Blu-Ray,My husband is a blu-ray and muppet junkie. I am glad they finally came out on blu-ray! I only wish they would make more muppet movies on blu-ray so I have more gift ideas for him.
3,Somewhat Fills that Empty Muppet Void,"As a movie, Muppets From Space is good, entertaining, family fun for the young at heart. As a muppet movie, it's definitely low on the list - but far, FAR above anything they've done like ""Kermit's Swamp Years."" I suffered through that one, while I actually enjoyed MFS. Like many have said it lacks the original muppet songs, but it has a fantastic opening sequence and features a lot of the less common muppets, like Clifford from ""The Jim Henson Hour,"" and many more. If you're a die-hard muppet fan, it's still a must have."
5,Muppets from Space,Hello..After looking everywhere for this movie I was giving up. I went online to Amazon and found it. WHY didn't I go there first I would have saved myself lots of frustration! My grandson loves it and so do I.Thanks for making our life happy!CT
3,Ho-hum,"At least kids may like this. I liked the talking sandwich-very surreal. And you'll never look at breakfast cereal the same way again either. Overall, though, it was kind of boring."
2,There are better muppet movies,"While i appreciate the attempt to make more movies staring the loveable muppets, i must say i was disappointed by this movie. It seemed to lack that magic that Jim Henson was able to instill in the first three movies and that was present in The Christmas Carol as well (i am not a big fan of Muppet Treasure Island either). A great movie for the kids i guess, but i think you diehard Muppets fans will be disappointed."
2,Not Jim Henson,"This is just the perfect example of why Muppet movies should have been left alone after Jim Henson's death. He was a great man who brought meaning and love to children's movies. (""Life's like a movie, write your own ending, keep believing, keep pretending..."") Disney movies and the like have very little substance when compared with one of Jim Henson's films. He could bring a serious theme to his silly, zany cast of characers and make it work. This movie doesn't work. Not only have original songs been abandoned, but it's a meaningless spoof of every sci-fi movie ever created. It can't possibly compare with Jim Henson's gems, where all the gags, music, and pupeteering worked towards a truly optimistic, American theme."
4,im still a kid at heart,"what can i say about the muppets?? i grew up with these wonderful creatures, from the movies to the muppet babies then to the show that bombed on network tv...and i never saw muppet treasure island cause i thought it was just the stupid muppets...well im a firefighter with no kids and i loved this movie....it was funny in all aspects from the adult comedic stand point, the hippies that gave bunsin and beeker a ride, to the crazy antics of pepe...where did they get this guy and why hasnt he been around longer, ""i am going to slap you....slap you like a bad, bad donkey...ok"" that is just the best...well it may not be the best muppet movie but it did touch the heart of this long forgotten fan.."
5,"Meet the Gang of ""Muppets Tonight""","As a devoted fan of both the original Muppet Show (no quotes necessary -- it's not just a series, it's a concept) and the short lived revival ""Muppets Tonight"" I must say that I think that ""Muppets from Space"" is the best Muppet movie since the original (""The Muppet Movie""). Not only does it feature classic Jim Henson muppets such as Kermit, Piggy and Gonzo, it also ""introduces"" some of Brian Henson (and company)'s new Muppets, such as Clifford the rastafarian catfish, Dr. Phil Van Neuter and my personal favorite, Pepe the prawn (I think he's from down on the bayou, ok?). The film's only lack is the relative abscence of Muppet songs from both movie and soundtrack. It's good, I promise."
3,"Actually, just one star","UPDATE: Since getting this bracelet, I've had multiple problems with it. The toggle slips loose easily, so the bracelet is prone to falling off. And the sterling wire linking the pearls is VERY weak - my bracelet has broken several times in different places. I would not recommend this bracelet to anyone!*******I love coin pearls, and really liked the alternating circle-and-square design of this bracelet. The actual item I received, though, was of slightly inferior quality to the one pictured; the square pearls are more irregular in shape and have lumps and projections at the sides and corners. In addition, the 7.75"" length (as opposed to a standard 7"") makes the bracelet a little too big for average wrists - I had to have a pearl removed from mine to make it fit properly. Overall, the round and square pearls are matched well for color, and the design is striking, but it would be a better value if offered in different sizes and included better-quality square pearls."
5,"Good story, good motorcycles, good acting","We rented this dvd and enjoyed it so much that we bought it. We've watched it several times over the years. The available audio languages are Cantonese and Mandarin. We used the English subtitles, since we don't speak any Chinese. This is one of the best Chinese movies that we've seen. We enjoyed the street racing, the plot, and the development of the relationships. It's one of those rare movies that doesn't depend on violence and sex to keep the audience's attention. This movie is not rated and it is certainly no more than a PG rating."
2,Propaganda,"What can I say, these must be a leftover from the cold war.The government must have exported these to China to scare the military.The damn things are not only too tight, the length is also inadequate.They must have struck fear into the poor communist solder not to fool with the big Americans.Can't say I would recommend these as the leave indentation marks on my pickle."
5,Lucky me,"Recently divorced, my new boyfriend had not had to deal with the issue of condoms until we started dating, and I noticed that Magnums were just not working for him. After doing some research I discovered Magnum XL and ordered them from the Amazon site. Great fit, great performance. I'm a lucky, lucky girl!"
1,"Great Idea, Bad Design","This grinder did make a great cup of coffee BUT only worked for 5 months. It had the ""Spin Free"" sickness. The motor ran but nothing else happened. I mailed it back to the factory store in NY City ($12.00 in shipping) only to find out that they didn't have any crome models in stock and would not for several months.They refunded [the cost of the grinder] very cheerfully but no mention about any shipping charges ($27.00 total, $15.00 Express shipping from Amazon and $12.00 to NY). I'm not a happy camper. I would not buy this product again."
5,A fine grind,"I have had no problems whatsoever with this grinder. When beans fail to grind it usually means you have to clean the machine as the oils have prevented the beans from moving down into the blade area. Cleaned it out for the first time in over 2 years the other day. Took all of 5 minutes to take apart, clean and reassemble.It really has worked well for me and the only thing I could want would be a doser model. So eventually I will upgrade, but waiting for it to die does not seem to be working!"
1,Quality control problems,"On the recommendation of a friend, bought two of these, one to replace my Braun which was noisy, messy, and slow; the other as a gift for someone without a grinder. The ""gift"" grinding range went from drip to very course It could not grind fine enough for espresso. Then after about 6 months the clutch mechanism broke so the motor continued to run but grinding halted. He got frustrated and threw it away. Mine is still running but unlike the other, the grind ranges from powder to drip. Can not get a grind course enough for a french press. I continue to use it but am looking for one that can grind a full range from espresso fine to french press course. The Solis Maestro Plus is so advertised but appears to be made by the same manufacturer as the Bodum so gives me pause. I'll live with it for now, but am not happy with mine and embarrassed over the one that broke."
2,Quinteto de Buenos Aires,"It is a brave attempt by recently deceased Spanish writer Vasquez Montalban to depict the post-dictatorship scene in Buenos Aires. The country was economically ruined, and despite cosmetic democracy, the hard liners still very much in charge. His detective Pepe Carvalho makes a circuitous attempt to make contact with a former revolutionary, now underground to persuade him to return to Spain, his adoptive country. Montalban description of Buenos Aires is almost cinematographic. He captures the flavor of Buenos Aires like no other non-Argentine writer could. The narrative is however rather repetitive and at times painfully slow, punctuated by moments of gruesome violence. Montalban, one of the late 20th century best mystery writers, could have done some serious editing on this particular work to improve readability. For those readers familiar with the Buenos Aires of the 80's, the book will no doubt bring back twinges of nostalgia."
5,END OF EARLY PONCENA SOUND,"This is the last Sonora Poncena album produced by Larry Harlow. It was always great to hear Ysyo el Indio, Adalberto Santiago and Marcelino Guerra on coro. It also has an augmented rhythm section with Nicky Marrero on cowbell. Awesome arrengements and Luigui Texidor is great on vocals!"
3,some good imagery but no substitute for lessons and improvement program,"spearman is a great teacher. i know this from seeing him on the golf channel and also firsthand from some people that have taken lessons from him in the nyc area. however, this book doesn't come anywhere close to the caliber of his personal instruction. there's a lot good imagary, but it's not a system for improvement you can really sink your teeth into like others would offer. what's lacking is at least some discussion of swing theory. the good side is that if you find just a couple good images that make you play better, then the book was worth the cost. but don't buy it thinking you'll get an organized program."
1,"Manufactured, assembly line thriller.","James Patterson and his latest co-writer have written a novel that appears to have been compiled from a crime novel cliche bin. Dozens of murders, overly-dramatic descriptions, and a climax that it is anything but. His leading character hardly spends more than a few moments investigating yet miraculously solves a baffling crime. Patterson has really stretched himself thin on this one. It is a true page-turner in that you keep turning pages to see if anything interesting will ever happen."
4,Keeps you guessing!,"I thought this was a good book that kept me guessing to the end. The chapters are only a few pages each, so the action shifts all over the place. The one unrealistic aspect of this book that I did not care for was the trial. She had this trial hanging over her head the whole book and yet she never really seemed to worry about it, at least not in the way that most normal people would."
1,This is a sorry example of good fiction.,"Yes, the authors are creative in keeping suspense alive, and they build on this strength by packing more suspense into 344 pages than you'd think could be done. But to accomplish this they move the story along at a fast clip (at times readers have to gasp for breath!), and dropped character development for the bane of today's popular fiction: the overuse of metaphors.But the book's real undoing is its unbelievably at critical moments. Whenever the suspense reached its apex the story became preposterous. Or, if you prefer: implausible, cockamamie, dubious, far-fetched, beyond belief, flaky, incredible, kooky, phony, or screwy. For example, try explaining the jury's verdict in light of its questions to the judge, and how a ""pretty, dark-haired girl of about eight"" inexplicably acquires wisdom and courage seldom even seen among adults.- John Ambrose, Falls Church, VA"
4,4th of July,"A very good book, fast reading. This book continues the Ladies Murder Club. Patterson's characters are well developed and quite believable as well as likable. I look forward to his next foray with Lindsay Boxer et al Recommend to all mystery/detective fans"
5,Thanks To Maxine Paetro,This is an excellent mystery story and I can only say thanks to Maxine Paetro. She obviously wrote a great deal of this book because Patterson has never written this well. Of the four books in the series this one is the best. If you liked Patterson's other books you will love this one.
4,Goor Read,"I have not read the previous books of this serious, but I want too after reading this one. I really enjoyed this one and found it easy to get through quickly."
2,Patterson has lost his zing.....,"the best in the murder club series, but still not great. got good towards the end."
4,Good Summer Read,"I enjoyed this book very much, as I did the other Women's Murder Club books. They are a good fast read!"
3,Okay read,This book was an okay read. I didn't enjoy it as much as the first two books. I knew who the culprits were nearly from the beginning.
1,Disappointed,"I have loved reading James Patterson books, and I've read quite a number of them. This book, 4th of July, however, was a huge disappointment. I am convinced that James Patterson did not write this book but it was written primarily by the other name on the cover, Maxine Paetro. First of all, the story is written from a female detective's point of view. Then the ""love scenes"" appear to have been written by a female. I've read thousands of books and I truly believe that Maxine wrote the majority of this book. There were even some areas where the chronological time line was out of sequence and I had to read and re-read those parts then just go on and ignore those parts because they never did fit in. This was the first book I've read in the Women's Murder Club series and it will be the last. I will, however, continue to look forward to books that James Patterson has actually written himself."
2,I learned a lesson!,"The main thing I got from this book is to NEVER again buy a favorite author's book which has been co-authored with an ""unknown"".I find it hard to believe James Patterson wrote or even okayed the ending of this book. The plot held my interest up to nearly the end. When the first killer was revealed, I accepted it because I suspected him myself, and his psychosis was fairly well brought out. But the other two? I actually laughed (in derision) because it was as if the writer decided, ""Oops! I'm running long on this story...better wrap it up NOW!"" The ending is so poorly done, with no explanation given for the murders being so excessively brutal; and what is the likelihood of three ""psychotic"" killers working together?"
4,Another good one,Couldn't put it down. I was determined to figure out the killer but was totally surprised in the end! Another great book!
5,Good book,I enjoyed the book very much. This was the 4th in this series that I have read. This one is a favorite.
4,4th of July,"As with all the Women's Murder Clud, this was was fast moving and an easy read. I really enjoyed the twists that I did not expect."
4,Terrific read!,"Can't recall the exact plot at the moment, which sounds odd, I know, but I do know that it was fast-paced, very enjoyable,with likable, co mpelling characters"
4,4th of July,This book i must say wasn't the best JP book i've ever read and i found that about half way through it slowed down a little but like all JP books the ending was thrilling and i was and i was glad to have read it.
5,uncerebral reading,I liked it. This is a fast paced light read which was perfect for bed time reading (don't get the idea that it put me to sleep). Better than night time tv. His book Lifeguard comes in a close second.
1,patterson's worst book to date,"What a disappointment! 4th of July read like a junior high book assignment. Worse, it was written in the fashion of an Encyclopedia Brown ""mystery investigation."" and ended much like a Scooby Doo cartoon! James Patterson's only contribution to this novel was his name. The writing (which seemed to be an attempt at an adjective/analogy lesson) was so inferior to many of his past novels.Honeymoon, another of Patterson's recent mysteries and co-authored by Howard Roughan, is another example of why great authors should stick to doing the writing solo.I'll pass on any future book that Patterson simply lends his name to!"
1,In the trash can. Really. Just tossed it.,"I got this book for free. But I would never be so unkind as to pass it on to another unsuspecting victim. So, I just put it in the trash (recycle bin). What a waste of a tree.Patterson, shame on you."
3,Losing me,"I have to say that this series started out great but is definitely not holding my interest. Most significantly, this series is supposed to be about a woman's murder mystery club, however this installment was seriously lacking in that department. Claire showed up occasionally and Cindy was completely insignificant. I have only 10 pages left and am in no hurry to get get back to it."
5,Excellent condition and service,"I was very pleased when I received my audio book. Not only was it in excellent condition, I received it promply."
4,Pretty good.,I thought that this series was quickly dying out but this book manages to not only put may faith back into the series but it could be James Patterson's best book in quite sometime. Much better than the 3rd book in the series and it has a great climax that really grabs you.I hope the fifth book is just as good.
1,The Worst Yet,"Occassionally I am prompted to write a review whenever a book is either brilliant or pathetic. In this case, it is the worst of this series that has been written. I quit buying Patteson books over a year ago due to the lack of substance in them. I only read them if someone gives them to me free which in this case is about what it is worth. Do not waste your money and start getting them from the library until he starts writing good books again."
5,Fourth of July,James Patterson lives up to his reputation as a suspense writer with lots of angles.I could not put the book down. I read it in one day!
5,Great Series,"Usually when an author puts out two series at the same time, both suffer. That's not the case with James Patterson.While Alex Cross is starting to get a bit stale simply because of how long he's been around, this series is picking up where he left off. Lindsay is a great lead character, and most of the supporting cast enhances the stories, though they're not very present in this installment. And, you can't go wrong with any story that features a herding Border Collie!"
2,Not A First Edition,"This is a Book Club Edition. I would not have purchased it if the seller had not advertised it as a ""First Edition"". I will never purchase an item off of this seller again."
3,Gory and Sadistic....Why do I love it?,As the previous reviewer mentioned Patterson is a love him or hate him type of author. I fall in the latter category. I find most his books to be by an almost nonsensical level of violence and other less specific types of mayhem. I keep reading them because in spite of the lack of character development in his books he is just one of those authors who's work is hopelessly addictive.Overall-I have to grudgingly admit that this book is better then Big Bad Wolf.
1,Rating the Presentation not the Story,"I hate these new taller books. Supposedly they are easier to read....actually they are just more money for the publishers. The reason I buy paperbacks is because they are less expensive. Then the publishers all got together and decided to shaft the paperback customer by offering some releases only in the taller size for 2 dollars more. I read 3 books a week, so I can't afford to waste money for a larger book with the same story. Does it add anything to the book? No, just more cost. I refuse to buy this book on principle. Maybe if my library has the hardcover I will borrow it from them, but I refuse to put more money in the publishers' coffers when they aren't offering this in the normal paperback size. If it was really for the reader's benefit that they offer the larger size, they would offer both sizes to better serve the consumer. I have seen only the taller book in every store I have visited, there is no regular paperback of this story."
4,A nice quick read,"When I read this book I did not know it was the fourth installment in a series. It was just fine as a stand-alone story. Not one of Patterson's better works but it was okay. The book made a little more sense after I read book #3, but at the time I did not realize I had missed anything."
5,Another wonderful one,It is a really great book. All of his books are great. The way the women in the club all get together is something else. They move on to find several things that have happened in the book that they have to clear up.
5,Woman's Murder Club series,"I have read all 8 books from the Woman's Murder Club series so far. I find them to be interesting, exciting stories, with wonderful Characters. I like James Patterson's other books too. Generally don't want to put them down and end up not doing errands, because I ""just have to finish reading a few more pages""!"
2,No excitement on the 4th of July,"Not the usual James Patterson book. I was disappointed. The reader was excellent, but the story seemed to drag...seemed like every other paragraph was a new chapter which broke the story up so much it was difficult to follow while driving."
4,"Great Addition To Series, But, Amazon - Shame On You!!!","The 4th installment in the Women's Murder Club was fast-paced, interesting, and filled the missing-member gap nicely per one of the major plots. The 'bad guy' revelation at the end could be intuited fairly easily, though, but took nothing away from the reading experience. My beef with Amazon, per the review title, has to do with revealing the resolution to one of the major plots involving Lindsay's trial: readers should be allowed to find out that she is acquitted, not told directly in the Publisher's Weekly blurb! Her fate could have easily followed any one of several courses, and that keeps the reader on edge. But thanks to Amazon, you don't have to worry about the trial's outcome! Gee - THANKS A BUNCH!! Duh! :("
2,4th of July,"Someone should have done some research - there is a difference between a civil trial where a defendant is sued for damages and a criminal trial where the state brings charges and a defendant's freedom is at stake. In a civil trial, there is full discovery - both sides get to look at and examine the other side's evidence. This book was commically inacurate and amatuerish."
4,Super good book,"I got this book yesterday from the library and could NOT put it down! James Patterson is so articulate in his writing, he puts you there with the characters. I will recommend this book and Mr.Patterson`s works to everyone."
2,Maxine Paetro is no Alex Cross,"I enjoyed the Women's Murder Club until I read 4th of July. It's a quick read, but that doesn't necessarily make it an enjoyable read. This book is predictable and it just was not as good as 3rd Degree. I was disappointed. BRING BACK ALEX CROSS!"
4,4th of July (Women's Murder Club),"Hated to put it down; hated it worse when I reached the end of the book! Thought about starting over, then decided to look for another by Patterson. I've found all his books to be excellent reads."
4,Patterson's Back!,"James Patterson has found his fastball again with this one. After the last horrific Alex Cross novel (London Bridges), I was worried that Patterson was writing too many books, too quickly. Well, he recovered nicely and returned to form with 4th of July. It is the typical Patterson that you will read so quickly(because it's that good) that you are disappointed it is over before you know it."
5,4th of July,James Patterson's books are truly great. I particularly enjoy the Lindsay Boxer and Alex Cross series. This one was just as much a spellbinder as the others. I couldn't put it down
3,Just so-so...I miss Alex Cross,"I just finished this 4th installment in the Murder Club series, and I feel it was the least engaging and fairly predictable. Lindsay is a great character, but Joe is very weak, and Claire and Cindy seemed to be after thoughts this time around.My main compaint this time was that the overall writing didn't feel like Patterson. The dialogue tags were cheesey. Sometimes the language was over-the-top dramatic or sing-songy. I just found myself laughing at times at how silly the wording sounded. I'm wondering if Paetro was writing more and Patterson's name was selling it? Any thoughts? Do share.Still worth-while read. I guessed one of the killers. Too bad the two story lines were kind of jarring--not woven together intricately enough.Terra"
3,4th of July,"I enjoyed the 4th installment of the series. As usual, the plot and twists and turns were exciting and compelling. However, this book deviated from the usual style and really had nothing to do with the rest of the Women's Murder Club. I felt like Cindy and Claire were thrown in as afterthoughts. I think one of the reasons that Yuki was a central character was to eventually replace Jill's void. I'm curious to see if she'll be in the next book. I felt that the ending was wrapped up too quickly, though. After the killers' identities were revealed, the story never elaborated more about the story behind Bob being Carolee's son, and what about Allison? Overall, a decent, quick, poolside read. Hopefully #5 will be more like the previous novels."
3,James Patterson - Just As Expected,"This was the first James Patterson book I have read. After seeing his books on newsstands for years, I finally gave one a try. As expected, the chapters were short, the story moved fast, and the main character saved the day. This wasn't a great book, but I disagree with some of the reviewers who thought this was a horrible book. What else can you expect from this genre of writing. I was satisfied because I found myself with a limited period of time over one weekend to read and did not want to start some of the lengthier books on my ""Must Read List"". So I chose this book for what it was - a fast-paced thriller. Readers who expect more should think about changing the type of books they pick up to read."
5,4TH IN THE SERIES IS TOPS!!!,"In this fourth novel of the Lindsay Boxer whodunits, readers are greeted with a shocker in the opening chapters. The events that follow find Lindsay facing a civil trial which could destroy both her personal and professional life. To escape the media in the afermath, Lindsay heads to sister Cat's house in Half Moon Bay, agreeing to housesit while she's away. But Lindsay is never far from a wrong needing to be made right or a mystery screaming to be solved...and such is the case here. Someone is killing couples in Half Moon Bay..in a particularly gruesome manner. And the killings bear a striking resemblance to an unsolved homicide that Lindsay investigated over a decade ago. Who is killing these people...and why? Teaming up with the local police chief, Lieutenant Boxer is anxious to solve the mystery...too anxious. Suddenly, she finds that she herself has become a target.......Just as entertaining as its predecessor, this novel is a true pageturner.DYB"
3,Not Patterson's Best,"This is a typical James Patterson book, but nothing really special. As in most of his books, 4th of July is a good read. It held my attention throughout and I had trouble putting it down as usual. However this is not his strongest offering. I found some of the events in the book to be a little contrived in that so many things happen to be inter-related. I also was able to quickly figure out some of the major ""twists"" fairly early on, so I wasn't constantly trying to figure things out because I already knew mostly what was going on.All in all, I would recommend 4th of July to Patterson fans, especially those that are following the Women's Murder Club series. It was an enjoyable book, but let's hope that The 5th Horseman brings us back to the normally high standard of thriller that I'm accustomed to from Mr. Patterson."
3,Good book for the beach,"I read this book during the week of the 4th of July and found it to be a good beach read, but not one of Patterson's best. There were some interesting twists and turns, but it wasn't a nail biter like so many of his other books are. The dialogue between the characters was less than stimulating, but fortunately the storyline was better. And as always, the surprise ending was a surprise. Not in a knock-your-socks-off kind of way, but a surprise all the same."
4,great read,I enjoyed this book I love the series and can't wait to see it on TV this fall great idea! I just hope this contuines.
3,Not bad,"It's a mystery (which is good) and it involves women (which is great). It could have been a little better. James Patterson has written some really great mysteries. I don't think he has quite found his niche with this group yet, but it's not a bad beginning. Has a way to go to match his Alex Cross mysteries."
5,Coming Back for More!,"This series just keeps getting better and better. After just the first paragraph I couldn't put the book down. Not often do I find a book that holds my interest so intensely. With such great interaction between writer and reader the only way to get more is to read two at the same time while waiting for the next one to come ""hot"" off the presses. Please keep them coming. S.L. Chessor, Author of Poodlums, Boogeymen and Booglers and My Tongue Fell Out.Poodlums, Boogeymen and Booglers: A Poetry CollectionMy Tongue Fell Out"
1,Bathroom reading,"Here's a behind the scenes truth (cause I work in a bookstore and know this) about some of these books that Patterson ""writes"". This was not written by him, sure he helped plot out the story, but he did not actually write the book. It is actually written by Paetro. Just because his name is in big print on the cover, don't be fooled. Maxine Paetro deserves a larger font, cause she actually penned this book."
4,Enjoyable reading,"Well, I'm in the process of reading the 4th book of this series. I find them very enjoyable. As soon as I finish, I'll be ordering #5."
3,Good read,Good book. Lacks some of the grip of previous books.This one took me a little longer to finish this one.
5,2nd time reading it,"I have read all but the 11th book. When it came out I decided it has been long enough and I could re-read all of the women's murder club books. This time I am buying them on my kindle. I am so addicted to James Patterson as an author. There is always more than one story to follow, no way you can get ""stuck"" on a page or two with this series. I have been reading in my spare time or before bed and I am purchasing these books about every 2 weeks. Buy them you will not regret it."
4,Totally gripping,"I don't normally like these kinds of suspense mysteries -- I like things more in the classic style. But there's no doubt that James Patterson knows how to keep you turning the pages. And this series isn't quite as gritty as his Alex Cross series. Love that it is in San Francisco, one of my favorite places. Highly recommended for anyone who likes fast-paced thrillers, strong female protagonists, Bay Area scenery, or just a fantastic beach read."
1,Damien Storm couldnt even write decent muzak for elevators,"This is awful. After reading the wonderful reviews written by ""A music fan"" I found some of his music on the soundclick website. I listened to some of the tunes excited that I found them to listen to. But ""a music fan"" was painfully wrong. Seeing as damien storm is from louisiana, and so is the person writing many of his reviews, i think hes writing them himself so that suckers like me will check out his product. This is not music. I would NOT recommend anyone to waste their time on this, unless you do not have hearing ability and want to annoy others for kicks."
2,The Singing Sucks,"I'm being generous and giving this 2 stars for the music - the singing should have been left off though, or at least a singer with some degree of talent brought into the project."
4,A good squirrely book,"This book is useful as a reference work for the backyard wildlife enthusiast. I maintain a web site about squirrels, and I often refer to my copy to answer online questions from people around the world. My only criticism is that some of the artwork is not entirely realistic. Some of the drawings have the squirrels' heads shaped more like a seal than a rodent."
2,Old Magazies: Identification & Value Guide,"Nothing against this publication, but it was not what I was looking for. I thought it would give the value of individual issues of specific magazines which it did for what I would consider antique magazines. However, there was very little information provided on old issues of contemporary magazines."
2,Informative magazine about magazines.,"This magazine gave me an idea of worth for my old magazines. It is nice & quite colorful. Lots of magazines listed.Buyers are scarce. Shipping is horrendous.I was glad to find this on Amazon, but it was of no value in selling my cartons of collected magazines.Ended up donating a few to local library & recycling the rest."
3,Decent Portugal book,"I went on a trip with a bunch of friends and between all of us we had every travel book on portugal that's been published so I had the chance to compare Frommer's to the other guides.Pros: Great restuarant/bar and hotel tips. All the restaurant tips were spot on. We used this guide almost every night to find places to eat and go out. Very informative about the historical/architectural significance of the sites.Cons: Poor maps - not much detail and street names and sites are not labeled. The book could also use a bit more description on how to get places. We took a side trip to Sintra and the Let's Go guide was much more useful for getting to and from the sites.Overall the book caters to a wealthier traveler than some of the other guides. Restaraurants that were listed as ""moderate"" in Frommers were listed as ""Expensive"" in some of the other guides. However, Frommers was very accurate when giving price ranges for the restaurants."
3,Should be more up to date for a 2012 edition,"This is a good source for hotel & restaurant choices, as well as sights to see. Pricing is a bit out of date for sights & museums. The description of the view from the terrace bar in our Madeira hotel is either totally inaccurate, or 15 years out of date due to tree growth."
3,could have been better,"Well, I had higher expectation for this collection. It's far from bad, but I'm puzzled by some of the selections. I really wouldn't call this a ""Best Of"" or a true retrospective because it leaves out too many of what I consider to be the band's best material. Studio albums like ""Gone to Earth"" and ""Everyone is Everybody Else"" (both of which now have bonus cuts) might be a better starting point for the beginning BJH fan. In any case, this is a band that should have been bigger. Where I grew up in the US, almost nobody had heard of these guys. A real shame, because they made some very memorable music."
4,It Does Numb You...,"I tried these not because of any problems controlling myself, but more to just try them for the heck of it. Something different. And yes, the Benzociane certainly does numb you which makes it both good and bad. On the good side it does make you go longer so if that's a problem, then this is a worthwhile thing to try.On the other side the benzociane dulls even further the pleasure which is already dulled by wearing the condom in the first place. I guess the best way I can describe it is if your tool had fallen asleep. Kind of the numbing, tingling feeling you get when your foot falls asleep. Very different. I certainly cannot say I had any problem with them breaking. I agree with the first review in that they seem even thicker than average condoms.It's not an item that I would probably use again unless I had some trouble but it does do the job that it promises to do."
2,Not my idea of a good time,"I gave it 2 stars because it does what it says it does, but about as enjoyable as eating a really good steak just after having novocaine injected into your mouth. (you know it should be great, but your getting no feeling at all)So if your goal is to brag about how long you can go, then this is the product for you. If you want to have any idea what is going on then look else where. Could not tell if I was in or out, ""at attention"" or limp."
1,One word review: Terrible,"This thing is ridiculous. After about 1 minute of sex I couldn't even tell if it was still in or not. I thought that it was extra small and cut off my blood circulation at first. Trust me, never buy these. I will pitch the other 10 of my 12 pack."
1,not like the picture,"Unfortunately the other review wasn't here when I purchased this. It is not white with opaque bubbles, as it appeared to me, but blue with green bubbles. In addition, it isn't metal even though it says that in the name. It's plastic painted to look like metal. I returned this product because there was a smattering of yellow glue on the canvas shade for some reason, that I couldn't really get off."
1,picture is misleading,The photo of this lamp makes it look as though the shade is a pale peach/rose color with a bubble pattern on it. It is in fact blue. Terribly disappointing. Just a warning. It would be cute in a little boy's room.
4,Only the truth,"Though I can be called biased, I believe that what I say about this book is true. Leila Hadley is, I believe, one of the greatest descriptive writers of our time. I know her personally, and despite what some may call a ""haughty"" writing style, I can confidently say that this book is a gem and true to her experiences. Every sentence leaps off the page with an explosive vitality and zest that shocks, delights and inspires. This is truly an exciting and delicious read."
2,a good idead with disappointing result,THe dust jacket of this book promises more that the book gives - I fault the editor more that the writer - This book has wonderful potential - Travel and mother /daugher relationship struggles - but there is not enought meat to sustain the length of the book.. The travel is wonderful and the mother and daughter both grow - but it dragged and got boring -Needs a nip and tuck- I broght it to India to read - and felt it captured some of the magic - but needed more.
1,The book is a chore,"This is the only book, in my entire life, that I have not been able to finish. It's a chore to read. I've really tried too. I've tried reading it on the flight to India, reading it on the beach, even soaking in the tub. It's pretencious and, in my opinion, without merit. It's unfortunate too because there are always glimmers of promise in the pages."
1,"Couldn't touch ""Beloved"" with a ten foot pole!","I fell into this book head first as it was highly recommended by my best friend. About halfway through, it just lost all momentum and sputtered to a dead halt. I wonder if the author was bored with all her money and spare time and decided to become a writer to ease her rich b**ch boredom! To be fair, there were some good descriptive passages of India, but that's about all I could say of redeeming value. Because I had put out my hard earned money for this tome, I forced myself to finish it. Lord have mercy on Ms. Hadley's poor daughter if she inherits her mother's neurotic philosophy of life."
1,Hell than no fury like a mother scorned!,"This book is an affront to the sacred trust between a mother and daughter. Ms.Hadley has no idea of how monstrous her betrayal of her daughter is in the self-serving, whining journey. I am skeptical as to the facts of this book and feel that it should be classified as fantasy/fiction.I can't imagine what would motivate a person to write such a book about one's child. I have a daughter and I would never in a million years write such an obscene and innapropriate book.I think Ms.Hadley should take the proceeds from this book and get a better therapist or psychiatrist. Obviously, for all the therapy she supposedly has had and which she brags about in the book, it doesn't seem to have done her a bit of good.Shame shame shame."
3,"Not sensational, not bad","I got this because I'm a Kiefer Sutherland fan. Rebecca DeMornay was in this much more than Kiefer - that was a little disappointing because he had lead billing. It was kind of an odd story with bizarre flashbacks. Interesting, though, with twists and turns. Worth watching, but don't go out of your way for it."
2,"Unrealistic, cheapo movie...","Not exactly a high-budget blockbuster here, despite the three high-profile main actors. Rebecca DeMornay plays a complex character who seems to be juggling toughness, street smarts and independence with a vulnerability and sensitivity to the idea of relationships. Interesting enough, but then she just ends up being DUMB in the end. In fact, the whole end is dumb, with one eventful (but predictable) scene and the rest of the movie just fizzling out--blah. Keifer Sutherland plays the macho main role who handily takes on five gangbangers at once with a crowbar (and conveniently for him, none of the gangbangers had any knives or guns to defend themselves with against the 160 lb. businessman Sutherland character--yeah, right). He would have been wasted in a flash in real life, c'mon!Just a pretty lame movie, overall. The story was overall pretty good, but some of the more farfetched scenes and the weak ending just kind of ruined it for me."
2,Sadly Mediocre Film Noir,"Promising cast let down by frankly awful screenplay. Poor directing meant that dramatic tension was noticeable by its almost complete absence, and character development was also weak. I think most of the people reading this review could have made a better job of this movie than the people who actually produced it."
3,Cute and quick...(3 1/2 stars),"Laura Hamilton is a pampered sheltered girl. Finally, at the age of 25, she is given permission to travel. While on a train to her destination she comes across the dark, dangerous, and oh so dashing Sam Duncan. Together Laura and Sam go on a wild journey and wind up falling in love along the way.""A Wanted Man"" started out very slowly and I wasnt sure if I was going to be able to read it to its finish, but it eventually picked up its pace and its characters became more enjoyable and well fleshed out as the story deepened. This is by no means a book that I would consider a keeper, but it was a fun book that I am glad I read."
5,Funniest Show on TV,"I was first introduced to this show by a friend in the USA (I'm in Australia) who asked if I'd seen it. No, I hadn't. Then I saw an episode on cable in a hotel and I knew what he was talking about.The situations are great - lots of improv but you'd never know it - it's very natural.This show is the funniest on tv, I bought a multi-region DVD player just so I could watch this. I know some Cops who have seen it and they say it's funny as hell. You can't get much better than that. Lot's of ""in"" jokes for real Cops too. If you know a cop, buy it for them!I love the start of shift briefings - quickdraw to see who has to go out and buy lunch. THAT is funny!"
5,the state,hey reno 911 fans. a few reno cast members did a show called the state in the 90s. it was hiliarious. they did like three seasons. look into it. youll love it.
5,one of the funniest shows,"this shows pretty much just a funny spoof of cops. For example after weigel's(sp?) accident, that looks like a suicide and its and hows she plays the suicide angle is very funny. When one of the cops (i don't know the name off-hand, I just know is was one of the guys) takes some kids on a tour of the station is very funny, and others that are just two many to mention (...)"
2,Disappointed,"I purchased both seasons, started watching the first season and never finished it. (It is still in my carousel DVD player) I thought it would be funnier than it was and I don't know when I might bother to go back and finish watching it. Others may disagree with my assessment but I think I may give my second season (unopened) DVD away as a gift."
2,Mildly Amusing,"RENO 911 is a mildly amusing parody of COPS. The batting average for jokes is about two out of ten are laugh out loud funny, but the rest of it does generally make you smile. Like all of Comedy Central's other shows, the thing is low budget, but I suppose that's part of the charm. As another reviewer has said, close on the heels of this release a true classic police parody is finally being released on DVD: SLEDGE HAMMER!"
2,Typical Comedy Central Fare,"Reno 911 isn't original, but it is often funny. It reminds me of Police Academy in many ways as well as Mad TV. The show is an improvised spoof of the reality show Cops, but if you really want to see a police show satire that rocks the house then buy Sledge Hammer: Season One! After more than a decade, Sledge remains the politically incorrect cop who can't be beat."
5,Reno's Finest,This DVD should be owned by everyone that likes to laugh that's all I have to say. Get it! or get a friend that has it. hahaha
4,The Mediocre Show That's Funnier on DVD,This show was funny on TV but it was viewed a lot less than shows like Chapelle and South Park. I rented the first season and it just seems so much better. This show is still not the funniest thing ever just because some some of the jokes arent great and it repeats itself a lot but you should still watch it.
3,-but Nick Swardson's 'Terry' character is the funniest ever!!,"The only reason I'm reviewing this is because, I swear, that Terry character is the funniest I have ever seen -painfully funny!!The only thing funny about this show (and yes, I sat through every episode) is the Terry character. They really need to release a Reno 911 of ALL the Terry moments (-Complete Terry Reno 911- PLEASE!!!???) and then it would be the funniest thing I have ever seen!That Terry (or Nick Swardson) made me laugh so hard I could barely breathe. And yes, there were other funny moments too but, after a while, the show was a chore and I realized I was only going through it just to see what Terry woud do next. He was that painfully funny for me."
3,"Funny, but not as good as season 2","The acting on this show is superb, every single charater has will leave you in an uproar. Right away, their random encounters with incompetence begin, as do the long-running gags, and recurring deviants. Their interations as a whole cast are a little disjointed though, something that is much improved upon in Season 2.The real reason I gave it only three stars is due to the less-than-stellar packaging. This season is not uncensored on the DVD set, which is kind of silly. Also, there are very few extras, and only 14 episodes.All together, Season 2 is a much better deal. Of course, there are jokes that run the entire series, but this set is not necessary for understanding the show."
5,Brownstone bowl,Pfaltzgraff bowl is my favorite of the Brownstone dinnerware. It has many uses and is very attractive.
3,"Laddie, A True Blue Story","This book was an old favorite of mine from childhood. I was happy to find it at Amazon and the book was as good as I remembered it, but the type was so small it made the book--a long one--less enjoyable. If I had been looking in a store I would not have bought this edition."
1,Misleading,It was slightly misleading that some of the grapplers mentioned in the description we only get to see for about 7 seconds. They were the whole reason I bought it.
5,A Phoenix defined.,"A great read. The main character finds peace at the end of his lengthy journey. Watkins posesses a wonderful feel for use of symbolism in flight and the exotic landscape of Morrocco and France. A powerful journey from nothing to rebirth. In the Blue Light...possess great imagery and movement of time.Never have I thought I could identify with a pilot from World War I. Much like Robinson Carusoe, Charlie Halifax, pushed towards the end of his moral and isolational limits, has estblished a friendship with a foreigner friend, becoming travel partners, like Crosby and Hope. Halifax remained passaionate yet myopic on his goal until the end, finally realizing new horizons lay ahead.This book is every bite as unique as his Archangel. Also look for Peter Gadol novels."
3,Sex and Zen II is one of the better Cat III movies,"This is one of the early adult movie that Shu Qi did and one of the more erotic ones. Like most Cat III movies, the story is silly. Kin (played by Elvis Tsui) is worried that his daughter, Yau, (played by Loletta Lee) will be taken advantage of by other men and forces her to wear a 'Chastity Armor'.Kin in the meantime has numerous wives, affairs and even seduces his own mentally challenged son's wife, Siu Siu (played by Shu Qi). Unknown to him, Shu Qi is an evil spirit in disguise.The movie climaxes in the murder of all of Kin's household. In the end, Yau, aided by a handsome swordsman she has fallen for and her fellow student with a mechanical manhood -attempt to seek revenge and save the world from sexual domination. I told you the story was silly."
3,Typical sequel - not as funny as the original,The original movie was excellent & humorous. The sequel is a bit disappointing -- a very typical sequel but it has a few funny moments.
2,don't buy these for a chevy silverado,I bought these for my husbands 2009 Silverdao and when he went to put the firstone in it fell through never to be seen again.
1,Blech!,"Browne's been quite successful, for decades, in getting starry-eyed college girls to sway along to those three chords he plays. And the lyrics? Well, Browne is probably the only person who can rhyme ""pretender"" with ""ice cream vendor"" and get people to think it's poetry. This master of the insipid and banal had the gall to say that Joni Mitchell is ""a bitter old woman who never had a great album"". Gee, Jacko, I think Blue is better than any of your pablum by a factor of about a zillion. And I'm not even going to MENTION Daryl Hannah. Oops. Don't support creeps, leave this drivel on the shelf."
4,As Good As They've Always Been,"This is the first CD from Jackson Browne of acoustic live material, in what I hope becomes a long running series of volumes. His voice is still as crisp as when these songs were first recorded. The sparse sound of only a piano or guitar really highlight how well written and thought out the lyrics are. The production is perfect with great sound quality, and they gave the introductions their own tracks. This avoids having to listen to a minute or more of Jackson talking. If you are fan you owe it to yourself to pick this is up. Jackson Browne is timeless!"
4,almost perfect,"i saw jackson Browne do an acoustic show a few years ago, and it was one of the best concerts i've ever seen. So i was really looking forward to this cd. And it was really satisfying, until Jackson Browne got to the political parts. It almost ruined the experience for me. If he had left that part out, and just concentrated on the music, this would be a perfect cd. As it is, parts of it sound like another disgruntled LA musician, which is disappointing."
5,Illuminating,"Like some of the other people who have reviewed this CD, I went to see JB perform during his live acoustic tour. I think the music on this recording is very true to that experience. You get a really good sense of what it was like to be there. More importantly, I think this CD gives you an idea of what the core of each song is, without the extra instrumentation and added background vocals. You feel like you are hearing the songs as they were written. Whether this is true or not is, of course, impossible for me to say, but you do get new insights by listening to this wonderful and intimate CD. This one is a must for JB fans."
5,"For Everyman, woman and child!","This is a truly special live disc that every Browne fan should own. Don't be turned off by the petty right wingers fetching and moaning about political commentary, it's practically non-existent and in the end, all that matters is the music, and the music is terrific. ""Lives in the Balance"" sounds as if it could have been written yesterday, not 18-20 years ago. Not a bad track on the disc. This CD is worth every penny....can't wait for volume 2."
5,Quality Jackson,"Very nice compilation of classic Jackson Browne music in a live setting. HIs stories between songs are entertaining without being overwhelmingly ""live"". Any fan of Jackson will love this pure sound."
4,"Intuitive, compelling, relevant and applicable","Dr. Boice's ""Two Cities, Two Loves"" intuitively hilights how Christians can influence the society in which they live by recognizing and lovingly addressing the candid realities of the society in which they live. Dr. Boice uncovers compelling evidence which reveals many shortcomings of the church at large and discusses relevant Scriptural truths which are necessary for every person who calls themselves ""Christian"" to embrace. He binds everything together with applicable exhortations to ""pick up the torch"" of genuine Christian living in a secular society. The point? To make America, town by town, a better place to live through living virtously, drawing people to inquire about the God we serve."
5,A Voice for the Ages,"This is the third of Dane Vannatter's three solo albums and maintains the same excellent vocals displayed on the first two, Dane's voice actually seems to improve with time, as one can tell from his more recent quest tracks on two Bob Levy CDs: ""Me and My Best Friends"" and ""Out in the Cold."" This one contains a similar sophisticated mix of songbook standards, broadway and pop tunes with a unique jazz flavor. My personal favorites are his beautiful version of Sondheim's ""Loving You"" from Passion and the bonus tract ""Paint Me a Leaf"" which is a special treat for anyone familiar with the O. Henry short story. As another reviewer stated, it is a rare treat to see him in person, and fortunately all his CDs capture his amazing voice."
4,Tangible descriptions of White resistance to Apartheid,"Jo Anne Richards has a superb knack of describing not only the climate of Apartheid, but also the colours, textures, and other sensory perceptions of the times. Her characters are an excellent precis of the types of people involved in those resistance circles. The frustrations and meagre triumphs, and then their inevitable marginalization are so tangible to the reader."
2,Alice really captures the spirit of a dying empire.,"Shute has a fluid writing style, and keeps the reader moving along, but to what purpose? It is such a period piece, celebrating the stiff upper lip to the nth-degree. Disparaging those silly women on the death march who weakly gave into showing their suffering. The good children never whimpered once Mother is laid to her final rest. This book is a touchstone for understanding the romance of the British middle classes at mid-century. It perfectly details the arrogance of the Great White conqueror."
1,Monotonous,"Although this book has its interesting points, all value is totally washed away by the drudgery of facts completely insignificant to the story. It drags on about very boring things that have absolutely no relevance (how good she is at making shoes, etc). The romance is quite artifical also, as Joe and Jean knew each other in the war for a very short time. Undying love as shown in the book cannot convincingly develop in this short span. There is no chemistry between these characters; they are in love with the symbolism that the other provides. Painful to read, utter dribble. As I said, its has good points, but by the time the book was over I wanted to shoot myself from boredom. Avoid this book."
5,One of many great reads,"One of Nevil Shute's more popular books (even made into a TV movie here in the States), A Town Like Alice is a consistently good read, and especially priced right in the Kindle version."
5,"Truly wonderful writing, not depressing like ""On the Beach""","A very gentle book, starting in abject despair for prisoners in Singapore during WWII and ending in beautifully in the Australian outback six years later. Nice to see Nevil Shute wrote a book that wasn't a downer (after On The Beach, I was worried). Best book I've read in a while"
5,the story is a sensitive reflection of historical events,"Of the collection of Shute's works that I own, there is not one that I have read only one time. Some have been read a dozen times--especially those that tell of England and the English at the beginning of WWII; the simple telling of stories of individuals and families about whom Winston Churchill spoke so eloquently ""we shall never give up"". Also intriguing are the stories of early aviation, like ""No Highway"" and ""Rainbow and the Rose"" that detail the ordeals, sacrifice and experimentation in early aviation. Many of these titles I was only able to find in Australia or England; many can be found on the internet at amazon.co.uk for United Kingdom."
5,This book is actually based on the World War II.,"My name is Danyal Ahmed. I am currently in class eighth. 'A Town Like Alice' is includes in our English Literature course. This novel is a masterpiece. I have also seen the movie of the novel. This book is actually based on the World War II. The book visualise the condition the women were facing in Malaya. The soldiers made the women march to different places. They thought that women are of no value. During the war, Jean Paget, met a guy named Joe Harman. They started to like each other. But Joe thought that Jean was married. But she wasn't.After the war, things turned differently. Jean went back to her home country, England, & Joe was back to Australia. After many years Joe came to know that Jean wasn't married. So he went England to find her. In the meantime Jean was in Australia finding Joe. So both couldn't find each other. But after sometime they were reunited & married."
4,"Transition, Contrast and Love in Colonial Times","The style of writing is the refreshing aspect of the book, it has a strong narrative and a 'calm', yet intense, passion. The characters values, both pragmatic and caring, the steamy life that is the tropics and the rugged 'outback' are clearly created, giving warmth and depth to an interesting and enjoyable read. It is a testament to many of the uncelebrated lives that survived WW2 and what they went on to create. The only critisicm, if any, is that the development of the plot seems a little fanciful at times, aside from that, this book will stay with me for a long time,I will give this to friends for christmas and birthdays. Read it, you'll be pleased you did."
5,Audio Book Review - Robin Bailey,"The listing here refers to the audiobook version, a recording narrated by Robin Bailey, a well known and respected British actor.His reading of A Town Like Alice is absolutely wonderful.He captures Noel Strachan, the protagonist/narrator, perfectly.The book is a well known classic, and this Bailey's reading brings the simple characters, extraordinary events, and rich geography, vibrantly to life.[...]I added scans from the audiobook to the listing."
3,Wartime Romance and True Heroism - But Flawed by Racism,"I sought out this book after watching the Australian television production of the novel, starring Helen Morse and Bryan Brown, on video. The book is not nearly as good. Yes, it's the same riveting plot, and yes, the main female character is a true hero, as well as a heroine. But the main male character is merely a cardboard cutout, and the thoughtless racism in the author's and the characters' attitudes toward the Australian aborigines is horrible. This is one instance where the movie is much better than the book. Watch the five hour video production, instead. It's great."
2,I don't care how this book ends!,"OK, the first 100 pages were great. It was a very gripping story. But when the tension ended, the plot ended. Who cares if Jean wanted to make shoes? Who cares how many stops her plane made, going all over Australia? Who cares what the people looked like, and what they did? If I wanted a book called ""People and Places in Australia,"" I would have checked it out. Meanwhile, back in the outback, there's no plot left. I can't make myself finish it."
3,A town like Alice,Delivered to me in good time. Nevil Shute has done better.I have difficulty reading this very small print!
2,do not judge a cover....,"I ordered this copy of ""Alice"" because of it's unusual cover.... I have other copies..This picture did not portray the book I received at all. The book I got was of poor binding quality. I sent it back. If I could purchase the book shown, I would.As far as the novel, it IS a wonderful story, and very worthwhile reading!"
4,GREAT!,"This was an ordered by my wife. She loved it.I found it boooring. So, not to be sexist, butI think women and men generally tend to togarvitate to cerntain novels. We usually readthe same stuff, but in this case, it's a ""women's""book."
5,A town like Alice,"My comment on this book is that we can learn a lot from this story and the difficult situations refugees have to face and fear. Nobody in the book liked the refugees and the people kept saying that there was no place for them. In our school there are many refugee children, and it's really not easy for them to adjust. So everyone should try to make the best of the situation he/she is in. I think it's a great book for pupils who like adventure stories and books about war. I enjoyed the book very much and I hope that other students will read it too."
4,A nice Love - Story,"I like the book very much because Jean, although a very young woman, was able to survive the war. She was very helpful too and when you read this book you can imagine what a selfless but confident personality Jean was. The book also shows that you should never give up ifyou are down.Amela Bukvic"
4,a wonderful historic read,"Since I am interested in civilian survivors of WWII Japanese concentration camps (those survivors in or around Indonesia), a friend recommended this book to me. The sense of time, eventual romance, detail, a different world, all transported me. There were surprising twists, which fortunately were undetectable in advance, and kept my interest. The era, characters, values and slices of life in the Pacific, Australia and Great Britain were well established. The sadness and horror of great trauma and how one survives was also well covered. The book did have a slow start, by today's standards, and was hampered by being told from the point of view of the solicitor who knew the other characters. This book would have been even more intimate and meaningful without this literary device. However, as the story built, the reader is rewarded by wonderful details, triumph and love."
5,Capitalizing on what Fate throws at You,"Written on two levels,this tale has much to offer. Superficially the Australian novelist and aviator, Nevil Shute weaves a suspenseful roller coaster story energized by life altering events that happen to ordinary people in little known locales in Malaya and Australia. Beneath the surface if you care to look for Aesopian conclusions there is a feast of commentary on the British character. Without revealing too much let me simply say that more respect is lavished on those who fully adopt the land they live in when compared to those who don't. Complacency in the face of danger, inability to adapt as conditions change, and unrealistic hopes contrast with courage, perserverence and ingenuity. Read this book; the journey is intriguing.And if you're like me you'll add a number of remote destinations to your ""bucket list""."
2,Be patient after page 235!,"When it comes to WW II, I have no idea about the troubles that happened in Asia. The story was very different and interesting to me. I read up to page ~ 235 very fast. I did not even sleep, it was so engrossing. But after page 235, there is almost nothing about the romance, it is only about stuff that have absolutely no relevance. I read the rest in 2 or 3 days, it was so boring. At that point, I only wanted to finish the book. I can't believe how such a nice story turned into a nightmare.I don't agree that the description of Japanese soldiers is racist. It is so obvious that the author is careful and emphasizes how humane they really are by repeating ""doing their best"" and ""carrying children""."
4,Very nice and an easy read,"It's hard to synthesize the plot without giving away a shocking surprise that occurs midway through the book. But the characters are all sympathetic, the plot captures and keeps the reader's attention, and the writing is fluid and easy to read. Most of the story takes place in the Australian outback, and my only criticism of the book is that I wish the author had provided a map (including the presumably fictional towns where much of the action takes place).The novel includes a love story that is satisfying without being sloppily romantic, as well as the successful efforts of a woman to turn a rough frontier settlement into a modern town with an ice cream parlor, a grocery store, a movie theater, and other amenities. It includes a heroic story (based on fact, according to the author) of survival by female prisoners of war in Indonesia.This isn't a deep philosophical work of art, but you'll feel sorry when it ends. Very pleasant reading."
4,A Town Like Alice,"Its a wonderful story, a good read! Book was a re-print tho and a few of the pages were out of order...but it did not detract from the story at all."
2,"Good start, no knockout ending","This book caught my attention cos part of the story is set in my country. However, I did not finish reading it. Like reviewers Jean and Belle, I found the beginning and middle interesting but there was no -- to borrow a term from James Scott Bell -- ""knockout ending."" After Jean and Joe met in Australia, the pace started to bog down. Also, I'm puzzled how a London typist can fall in love with a cattle station manager -- considering not only the differences in their backgrounds but also the limited time they had spent together while being prisoners of the Japanese. The author also used several fictitious towns in Malaysia which puts off Malaysian readers like me. He should have consulted a map to bring more reality to the march by Jean and the other women."
4,A Town Like Alice,A very easy read. Characters you care about.A slice of a time gone by. Chance encounters and extraordinary events shape our lives.This story tells how one person can make a difference.
5,"Another place, another time","Read this when I was a teenager (in my 60s now) but recently visited Alice Springs and wanted to revisit my earlier reading and also Alice in the late 40s/early 50s. This book stands up to the test of time - it's inevitably somewhat dated and slightly mannered, and terribly politically incorrect, but it is a delightful read. Loved it the first time around, and the second."
5,"Loved the book,story is timeless","I have read A Town Like Alice at least ten or twelve times. I discovered it while in high school and continue to pick it up at the ripe old age of 55.Every time I read it I find something new in it. Courage is timeless,love is timeless. Great writing is timeless."
3,Misleading Title,"Perhaps a better title would be ""Nixon Juxtaposed."" A standard biography focuses on the person,up close and either distorting or ignoring the context. This text pulls the camera back to a distance where the lense incorporates the events and other personalities which were operating simultaneously, giving Nixon a context. And with the broader lense of context comes further revelation. ""Nixon and His America"" should be read after two or three ""hard"" biographies. When you think you know Nixon up close and in detail, step back and understand him in bas relief.If you are of an age that you can remember Nixon as Vice President and forward, then you can participate in this book by comparing your recollections of events with this account. You may or may not adjust your perception. We are all products of our environment and the age in which we live. Nixon was no exception. He, as all of us, had many facets. ""Nixon and his America"" reveals yet another."
1,Lab chewed up ball first day,Our Lab puppy loved this ball but chewed up the outer ball the first day.
5,Jordan was a jerk,I found that I do not like him as much as I did after reading this book. He was a bully and felt that he was the star and the other players did not matter on the team.....what a jerk......learned a lot about his personality and I can understand why the other players did not like him and his wife divorced him....what an egotist.
2,"Great book, terrible Kindle edition","Beware of the Kindle edition of this book--tons of typos, missing and duplicate chapters, incorrect table of contents. I wish i bought the paperback."
3,Behind the scenes look at MJ and the bulls,"The book shows just how tough life in the NBA can be, especially when you have a guy like MJ, a selfish ball-hog and control freak. After reading the book, any liking I had for MJ has since vanished. Behind the scenes, the guy is selfish, narcisistic, hyper-competitive person who must win at EVERYTHING he does, and have things HIS way all the time. He even went so far as to never lift weights in the same weight room as the team for fear that one of the players might be able to lift more weight than him. Boo hoo! Imagine that Michael! There might be someone actually stronger than you."
5,The MOST OVERRATED PLAYER EVER,"This Book was very Good.But I Believe that Jordan is The MOST OVERRATED WALKING, TRAVELING, PLAYER EVER.he came out at a Good Time for The African-American Player.With Marketing&all.but He will never Mean what DR.J was.DR.J did everything before Jordan&did it with Class and Dignity.But DR.J was On The Real.He Didn't Front For Nobody.this Book Shows all The Vanity Of Jordan.He can't stay out of The Spotlight? Tacky Commercials etc...and Bad Movies Space Jam.He was a Great Player but Not as Great as The Hype.without Pippen he wouldn't have all the Juice he has."
4,Great book but Kindle edition is awful so stick to hardcover.,"A great read for any basketball fan who wants a view of a team beyond the court. That being said the Kindle edition of this book is poor. Repeating chapters and paragraphs, poor TOC. I highly recommend sticking to the hardcover."
2,No where near as good as the real shows,"The real shows of this were far better. This is a butchered, sanitised, half-baked version despite the DVD claiming to be 20 minutes longer. Many of the performances are no where as powerful as prior efforts and some content is cut down to small portions of the prior pieces heard on DEMOCRACY NOW and found on YOUTUBE. Kilcher's reading of Chief Joseph is murdered on this DVD for a better version see the link on my website [...] links to a youtube from Sundance 2009.There are huge topics watered down or omitted by this presentation. Where is Haymarket ? Where is Alexander Berkman? Why is Ellsberg included ? So many other thoughts ran through my head watching this. Go to youtube watch Sandra Oh's performance of Emma Goldman on Patriotism so much more powerful than what seems like a rehearsal take on this DVD."
4,Would love to see this live...,"This is the sort of thing students need to experience. It drags a little toward the end, but overall it is well done as well, as enlightening to watch."
4,Some factual US history Impersonalised,Educative to a reviewer US-doco-data is combined with performing and commenting by artists and activists. Sometimes it's quite boring but useful anyway as lessons of history were.
2,Just read some of his books instead!,"I have no problem with Mr. Zinn I have great respect for his ""People's History,"" but this DVD sucks! It about as watchable as a goth poerty jam at a community college. I found watching famous airheads dramatically reading the words of the dead interspaced with weak musical preformances unbearable. This is the kind of thing that makes people hate the Left."
2,"America bad, socialism good","A movie that celebrates the downside as if it wasn't something no one knew about. You have to love America bashers recycling of old news and presenting it as ""secret history"". Yes, this is the history you'll also get to see in the upcoming Stone flick. ""The People Speak"" is propaganda designed to influence young minds into believing the country has no redeeming qualities and must ""change"" to socialism. Ironic that people like Matt Damon puts his money in projects like this instead of projects to actually ""help"" his target audience. If you're a big fan of Che and Fidel though, then this is for you. Enjoy.If you're a teacher looking for propaganda about the evils of America, maybe you could help the kids load it on their IPODs so they can watch it in their spare time."
5,The People Speak,I was astounded by this dvd! Powerful and important. Have I been living so long with my head in the sand - ignorant of what the poor and unprivileged people experienced through out American history? Sad how so many relevant voices from the past have routinely been squelched by the powerful and inconsiderate. Thank you Zinn for giving them voice and doing the research to bring a bit of equality to our understanding of history
1,Howard Zinn is just another privileged academic,deploring the country that gives him the very right to speak as he chooses. I wonder how brave he would be in Communist China or Iran? Because he certainly isn't bucking any trends here -- all the folks who hold power are the very ones kissing his a@@ and vice versa.
3,"Too much candy coating, not enough almond","Sure they look nice, but the coating is so think you just suck and suck and wonder why, since they should be mainly almonds, after all.Grecian Imports Brand - Jordan Almonds - Super Fine (Best Grade) - Assorted Colors - Polished (shiny) 1 pound"
1,JUNK,JUNK!!!! DO NOT BUY IF YOU LIKE YOUR TRUCK! DO NOT FIT WELL! Don't get your hopes up thinking these will look good!
5,You can change without self-improvement.,Terence Grant describes a process of personal change through self-understanding and God's power. He describes how we struggle to attain some ideal and yet we are unable to attain the ideal through our own power. Instead we can gain freedom by learning to live in the present moment and listening to God in prayer. Mr. Grant provides a viable way of personal change without self-improvement.
4,Strong but deelish!,"By looking for an affordable substitute to the big coffee chains, I found this. It's excellent and more healthy because it is not full of sugar like other powders. At first I kept making it WAAAAY too strong because I've tried many other types of powder that required 2-3 tbsp per cup. This powder is pure green tea and a little goes a long way. Because a little goes a long way, it is definitely worth paying a little more $$ for this product...the other ones might be cheaper but you need a lot more in your cup to make a good quality green tea latte."
1,Worst packaging ever received.,"Matcha tea is not cheap, even on Amazon. I was slightly confused when I opened the bag to find another sealed and labeled bag inside. When I removed it and got Matcha tea (which is powdered) EVERYWHERE, I realized the company had just shoved a split bag in another bag. When I'm paying this much for tea, I don't expect third rate packaging and short of weighing the product I can't be sure how much had spilled before they decided to shove my bag in another bag.I will not buy my matcha from such an amateur company again and I suggest you look elsewhere for your matcha needs. This company obviously is not concerned about customers."
1,Ordered the item on the 7th.. wasnt shipped until the 14th!! WAY BEHIND THE ESTIMATED ARRIVAL DATE!,"Ordered the item on the 7th.. wasnt shipped until the 14th!! WAY BEHIND THE ESTIMATED ARRIVAL DATE! They did not offer any compensation for my inconvenience. When asked if they would express ship the item, they responded ""since we use proirity mail there is no guarenteed arrival date"". RIDICULOUS. I got this item FINALLY on Friday Oct. 17th (10 days after it was ordered... 5 days after the promised time frame) Product is just so-so. It only comes in a silver packaging, with a home-made looking logo on the bag. No Nutritional info, no ingredients. The communication was also very poor. took 2 emails befoe i got a response."
4,Good but not quite starbucks,"I bought this item based on the good reviews it got and for the price. I think this is a product that is more useful in baking than a hot tea - it seems to require a lot of careful mixing that is too much hassle for a quick cuppa. It was green and not brown like one of the reviews here stated. I just bought an ice cream maker and am planning to use it for that or just to add to my morning smoothie for a boost. I recently got a bag of the Starbucks version that is mixed with sugar and it blends very easily with hot water. They don't sell it in their stores in powder form like you can buy coffee, but I know enough people in the Starbucks biz to get it on a regular basis. I think I will stick with that version for a hot tea, but I think this 1lb bag is good value for my baking purposes. Hopefully the ice cream will be as good as I want it to be!"
4,Great value...,I have had other matcha powders before and for its value I think you can't do any better than this. I have my matcha every morning and I love it..
5,Good Quality,"It definitely met my expectations. I thought the quality was great for the price I paid. I would definitely buy this again, from this company."
3,Ok Matcha for the price,"Tried matcha green tea powder for the first time and this one is actually not too bad. It doesn't taste muddy and I taste the matcha green tea flavor. So far, I've only tried this with hot water and as an ice tea. I will try it in smoothies next week. Satisfied with the product and price but the only drawback is the packaging. I cut a slit on the side and fold it after using, but a lot of the powder came out! So I had to pour it all in a tuber ware. You gotta change the packaging to a zip lock bag or something. I wanted to order more but in the 16 oz, but the only thing stopping me is that there is a shipping fee AND it's sold by another company, why is that??"
5,great for baking,"I use this matcha for baking - green tea muffins, cheesecake, etc. It is great and really flavorful. I would recommend."
5,Delicious & Nutritious,I am so happy I purchased this. I put it in my morning green smoothies in addition to drinking throughout the day. I prefer the taste over regular bagged green tea. We also use ut to make home made mochi.
3,Hood lock for Jeep Wrangler,"After 2 yrs, the rubber seals have cracked even though my Jeep has not been left out in the harsh elements. During a long road trip, one lock became loose so be sure to travel with the right sized hex key. Dry lock has prevented this from happening since that episode. Also, after having your Jeep serviced, be certain to check the hood locks making sure they are truly locked as one side of my hood was whipped up by the drive-by wind of a semi trailer truck. That was frightening! It is not obvious that my hood is slightly warped until I open the hood and attempt to re-lock it. These locks are not theft-proof, but at least they would slow down someone trying to gain entry to the motor. I would buy these locks again but I am disappointed that I can not find replacement parts for the cracked rubber seals that protect the painted surface of my Jeep."
3,DECENT...,"i gave this 3 stars cause only half the album is hot.the beats on the first half on the songs really aren't all that good.plus with the way these cats spit,the songs kinda sound the same.about half way through the album picks up.the production gets better and the lyrics just seem a lot cleaner.this album is NOT amazing,but worth a listen."
2,Turkey of the Year 1999,"This makes WILD WILD WEST look like a masterpiece. God! A superhero wannabe spoof sounded like a great idea, but, oh dear. The movie starts off amiably enough with a slapstick fight scene, and our wannabes try to muscle in with Captain Amazing, a corporate-sponsored superhero(this gives the filmmakers a chance to advertise . . .). But after then, the jokes are so lame and this movie is done with such glumness that the cast look positively embarassed and depressed throughout. Any laughs engendered by this turkey are at it rather than with it. However it gets two stars as it is such chronic trash it is somehow entertaining, a bit like HOWARD THE DUCK from 1986(remember THAT! ). And to think LAWRENCE GORDON, the man behind EXECUTIVE DECISION and the DIE HARD movies produced this nonsense. I suppose in a few years it'll become a cult classic!"
3,Silly movie...,"Silly, fun movie. I rented it since it has some stars I like. Glad I didn't buy it. - Wouldn't want to see it again. (Got all I could out of it the first time)"
1,just about the worst film ever made,"This has got to be the worst movie ever made. Plenty of money and talent in a film dubbed as a comedy. Timing was abysmal. Some of the concepts in the story were brilliant, but the comedic timing was the worst... a full cast of chimpanzees would have had a better chance at getting laughs. The only way this film would be funny would be if one was totally under the influence of alcohol... once your senses are dulled enough, the comedic timing should be just about right. Awful."
1,would not play on any blu ray player,"Nice package but I have not found any blu ray player that sees any content...I load the disc in, the player says, ""loading"" then kicks the disc out and says, ""no disc found"". I have tried it on separate machines...so perhaps that one disc was bad? I actually bought two discs and had the same problem with the second! Horrible quality control for this product!"
1,missing scene,The movie was a little anticlimactic because the last scene was not on the DVD... not impressed
4,A bad film...but it's supposed to be.,"I think some people took this film a little too seriously. Yes, it's a bad film, very much in the ""B"" move style, but it's supposed to be. It's a lighthearted spoof on all the superhere films. It's not supposed to be side-splittingly funny, just humerous. Watch it second time. It WILL grow on you."
1,possibly the worst movie in history,"That sums it up. Save your money. This was not a comedy, but it was a farce. Life is too short to waste 2 hours of it watching this dreadful mess."
