4,iTouchless DLX,"The iTouchless DLX is actually pretty good. It's bright enough and lasts long enough. However, when I ordered a second one, the seller shipped the wrong flashlight. Twice. Makes you wonder if all the reviews are actually about the same product. No wonder the reviews are so mixed."
2,Longevity is poor - the light is really dim over time,"The flashlight worked just fine at start, but after owning it for a while, it's unusable as the light is very dim. Not the thing you want in an emergency."
5,Works great with my Manhattan Portage Cornell Bag,Makes the strap on my cornell bag much more comfortable. The small shoulder pad is a great size for me - I don't have wide shoulders and didn't want something huge. This shoulder pad would work well for other messenger bags also.
3,A bit wide,"i bought this to use as strap for my paintball marker but the pad is wider then the size strap then i am using, other then that i the strap its self has good to fair padding and great velcro to hold the strap in place"
4,Part fun...Part romantic...Part nostalgic...a nice mix.,"A friend lent me the CD to listen to several years ago. I really enjoyed the fast songs, but one song, ""More Than The Stars"" really caught my ear. So much so, in fact, that it was the song that my wife and I requested for our ""first dance"" at our wedding reception. It was nice. :-)"
4,Natalie Cole in her prime...,"I bought this album on cassette years ago and have been looking for the cd version for awhile. I'm glad to have found it at Amazon and so cheap. Yea! My favorite tracks are ""Everlasting"", ""More Than The Stars"" and the remake of her father's classic ""When I Fall In Love"". There is no fillier on this album and each song is well thought out and arranged. For Natalie Cole fans this is a must have and a nice addition to anyone's collection who is a fan of smooth grooves and pop."
1,If only the editor would have followed Charlie's advice.,"When an author has great material, the quality of the resulting work is usually hard to diminish. This book is a rare example. Peter Kaufman's editing is so disruptive (repeating text, annoying graphics, irrelevant photos) that I can't believe Munger (who's mantra is ""I have nothing to add"") ever vetted this compilation. But then Munger did predict such events in number 23 on his list of the Psychology of Human Misjudgements -- ""The Twaddle Tendency."" If you've already bought the book, go directly to page 139 and just read Munger's talks, trying to block out all of Kaufman's distractions. If you haven't bought the book, save your $60 -- Munger's stuff is such that someone else will have to write a better book."
3,Silent partner,"Most billionaires have a stellar silent partner, Warren Buffet is no exception. The speeches chronicled in this book may take more than one read but they're insightful. Munger's deep analysis doubles as life's lessons as well as financial advice. Refer to it often, it's worth every penny!"
1,caveat emptor,"if you are looking for a book written by or even heavily influenced by deepak chopra, this is NOT it. he may have had some input into original concept for the story, but the book is thouroghly steeped in western philosophy. chopra's other books have an eastern point of view that is missing here. this is unfortunate, since this story, if told from his cultural vantage point, might have provided unique insights into the basic concepts developed in the story."
1,I found this book to be confusing and choppy.,"Although I had great expectations for this book, I was thoroughly confused and disappointed with it. The plot is difficult to follow (going just too far in jumping from here and there). The characters are very flat and I found that I really didn't care what happened to them at the end of the book. Finally, the ending was disappointing--difficult to accept after all of the happenings within the book. I found it difficult to accept that Ishmail could be fooled in such a way."
2,Fragmented / fragmenting,"I bought this book with great expectations because of previous books written by Deepak Chopra that I had read. I did notice the Ash Wednesday slip and a 'to' that should be 'too', but more than anything I was sad that I could not grasp what this book was about. I have a great respect for Deepak Chopra and his wisdom, but whereas I can usually grasp the message of his work and learn from it, this book was beyond me. It was generally a disappointing experience, though I did enjoy remembering the places I have been to in the old city, and at times felt that I was actually walking through those streets again. If it means that I need to be more spiritually evolved to understand this book, then I look forward to the day. Maybe Deepak could write an explanatory volume so that people like me could understand the message and images and metaphors in ""Lords of the Light""."
3,Not bad,"This new genre of ""spiritual fiction"" has many more misses than hits. I would call this one a near hit. Near because it starts out great and had me right with it until the last few chapters, then I sorta lost interest. The story takes some odd turns and although it does make some important points, it seemed to miss others. If you are interested in a good spiritual novel, check out ""The Destiny of Miro"" by Julie Rae Rickard. It is a great combination of spiritual ideas in a fictional format. A great read."
1,Chopra's Lords of Light... Extremely boring and Confusing.,"I have read several books by Mr. Chopra... Some of them very inspiring... Quantum Healing, The Seven Laws..., Ageless / Timeless..., and I'd recommend them to readers interested in that kind of material.I had also read Mr. Chopra's novel about Merlin, and got very bored and confused with it. I don't even know how I could finish it.Yet, I wanted to give him another chance and bought Lords of The Light... It's just as boring and confusing, but at least is shorter.Mr. Chopra... Perhaps I totally missed the point in those two books, but I'm giving you no more chances with your novels.From now on I'll rather read New Age novels from writers such as James Redfield, Dan Millman, Hank Wesselman, Marlo Morgan (""Mutant Message, Down Under""), Ken Carey..."
2,There need to be some consistent rules in any game.,"It's interesting to see the different reactions to the book. I read it first, knowing nothing about it and not looking at reviews. Though I did enjoy reading it, I leaned towards those who found it confusing. My biggest problem was the arbitrariness of the universe we were put in. The rules changed every few paragraphs, so I found that it all became rather arbitrary. After a while I cared less about what was going to happen and certainly gave up trying to make any sense out of it. In the end they somehow got rid of the Prophet but I really have no idea how or why it worked."
3,Something's wrong,I can't review the product. But the price is way off. Anybody who pays $325 for an 80gb hard drive needs to start sending me cash.
3,clean design,"Downgraded to 4 stars on poor selection of included mounting parts for all situations. As stated by others expect to have to buy cabinet mountng hardware and TV bolts that will work best for your situation (included TV screws worked for me). Also be aware you need a deep cabinet to make this viable. Downgraded to three stars on lack of versatility and poor instruction booklet. Mounting plate has three sizes which should cover all mountings for smaller TV's 17 thru 22""; though the mounting bracket can pivot left or right there is no top to bottom axis adjustment so the only way to angle the TV up/down axis is shiming the TV mounting bolts with washers which could cause thread alignment issues.Good quality construction of main unit, good packaging. For the right situation this is a great choice."
5,Very Pleased for RV Use,I needed a mount for my RV that would mount under the cabinet and not against the wall.... After going thru numerous forums to see what most where using this mount came out most. I like the way the mount plate to the tv has the little keyhole notches and can slip the tv out of the mount very easily if wanted.... tv will tuck up under counter and you can adjust the tension to what you want but most have put a little bungee strap under the tv to hold it in place while traveling with the rv...... You won't need to do this if it's for home use. Overall very satisfied with the quality and i would buy it again if needed.
5,Does a good job,"Ordered to use with a 15"" TV for my kitchen. Well made and sturdy. TV able to swivel easily. Can flip the TV up under the cabinet, but I don't like the way that looks so the TV is always kept in the down position. The only problem I have had is the TV seems to work its way down the stand. Nothing major and it can be wiggled back up, but wish it would stay in place. I know the screw could be tightened more, but then swiveling the TV is a little more difficult. Also wish the bracket came in a black or brown tone."
5,Nice Mount for the $$,"Used this on a 19"" wide screen LCD TV. worked good.My cabinets are not deep enough to be able to mount the TVand have it fold up under the cabinet. But I knew this when and bought it.Installation was easy using the T-nuts and screws provided.Had it mounted and watching TV in about 20 minutes total."
3,Doesn't fit Dell monitors,"Well built, but the bracket doesn't fit the two Dell monitors I've tried it with so far. The top tabs stick up too high. I'll probably just grind them down."
5,Does a nice job,"The price of this mount is quite reasonable compared to others I found on the internet. It is well constructed and has a very nice appearance. Just note that it only moves on one plane so if you turn the TV but need to move it to a different angle - move the bottom back a bit to angle the surface of the TV looking a bit down when you sit at a kitchen table - it will only move a corner of the TV up or down. The viewing angle will not improve. Please note that this is not a criticism of the unit, just a limitation you might need to consider. The fact is if the TV I purchased had a better viewing angle, this would not be an issue at all. I would purchase this mount again and would highly recommend it."
4,Good quality but too long for standard width cabinets,"This product was very well constructed. It's a good solid strong metal and not ""tinny"".Unfortunately with my standard depth cabinets I could not mount it under the cabinet because it would not fold up without hitting the back wall. This was the reason I bought it as I want to fold away the TV when not in use. I had to return the stand. If you have deep cabinets this should hold a 15-19"" TV without any problem."
4,works great,"Works great.. a bit hard to adjust and doesn't stay up all the way with the cords for the t.v. on the back.(would be better if the cords for the t.v. went in to the bottom of the t.v. and not the back. I have to keep the alen(sp) wrench handy to keep the tele up when not in use. the swivel part is nice and it works for the small 15"" t.v."
5,great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I cannot say enough about this product. It is truly one of the best buysI have made. After looking at many very expensive tv mounts, this one by far was best. It was inexpensive, easy to install and gives you many options on how to view the tv. I highly recommend it."
5,Excellent mount,"I used this product to mount a 15 inch TV/DVD combo in my Casita travel trailer. It is an excellent mount, easy to install, and attractive. I am sure it would also work well to mount under a cabinet. Swivels and tilts easily. Very sturdy product. Good instructions. Includes all hardware, but I had to get a few other materials to mount mine since it is installed under a fiberglass cabinet in the Casita (plywood to secure the bolts). I highly recommend."
5,Easy to install,This wall/cabinet mount is one of the easiest to install I have encountered. Thanks for the ease of installing this quality product. Excellent instructions.
3,Generally Does what it says it will do,"This stand is more than enough to hold a 19inch TV and holds just fine with the screws provided in the package. However, my cabinets are full wood planks at the bottom to support any screw you install. The TV will swivel to the right and left but does not fit below the cabinet to fold it up. i would still recommend this stand for people looking to hang their TV under the cabinet. it definitely clears the countertops."
5,Perfect for under cabinet mounting,I spent quite a bit of time looking for a decent under cabinet mount. This one is of a very sturdy construction and only requires minor adjustments since it is a tension holding system. Great product!
1,ok,"Can not use, it is bigger than my cabinet I have to see about return it back or find onother use for it"
3,"Perfect, But...","The mount was perfect for my use between kitchen and breakfast area, however when rotating back and forth the clamp slips and the television slides downward. Have to keep retightening. In fairness, I don't think it was designed to swivel. Also, I don't swing the the television up to the up & closed position, but when I tried it would not hold a 19 inch LED TV."
4,Calming Christmas Sounds,"Each year we tend to make Christmas dreams harder to achieve as we place higher expectations on material goods. If you find yourself stressed this Christmas, make yourself a good cup of joe, light a fire, put Ella Fitzgerald's Christmas Album on, and then snuggle with a loved one. Ella's masterful styling mixed with an unobtrusive choir, reminds us that Christmas is simply about family and Love come down to earth."
3,not charming but ok,"Not the most charming or delicate. It looks nicer in the picture. Fast delivery, I guess for the price it was OK, as long as one gets ""super saver"" in shipping."
1,don't bother unless the person wearing it has a tiny head!!!,"I mean really really tiny (think of a teeny tiny head, like after head shrinkers are finished). I returned this the same day but I'm out the shipping charges both ways!! what a rip off!!I wonder why this company makes a product that is not usable."
2,not as described,"I am pleased with the pendant but very dissatisfied with it as a necklace. In its description it clearly says, and I quote, ""Comes ready to wear with a jewelry black rope necklace"", well only if you have an EXTREMELY small head. The small black rope doesn't open nor adjust, making it absolutely impossible to wear it as a necklace! I bought this as a gift for my graduating piano student and won't be able to use it."
2,not for us,"though the stories are well known, are also not well done and more so, another movie is added at the end that you will NOT want your children to see - it really makes no sense that Sherlock Holmes should be portrayed in such and ugly and trashy way....totally disgusting"
5,The Belmonts are true DooWop,"An excellent CD highlighting one of thee finest groups of the DooWop era.Even without Dion, the Belmonts are true classic DooWop at its best."
2,Disappointed for the most part,"While I bought this book with much anticipation of receiving some really hepful info, I was disappointed throughout.In hindsight I wasted my money. Ok, it had a few good points but it was NOT worth the money. Don't waste yours..."
5,Stop wasting your life in front of the box...,"The best thing about this book is that it is concise and to the point. The message is clear, it is not interspersed with lots of waffle just to create extra pages, and it gets the message to you hard and fast that you can create your own business RIGHT NOW! Stephen also has lots of helpful tips and strategies that have worked for him to get him to where he is, and can no doubt work for you too. On top of all that, it is written in an easy to read and fun manner so you don't get bored at any point.Randeeshwww.control-depression.comwww.randeesh.wordpress.com"
2,"more hype, more of the same","As an internet marketer who has been very successful with ebay, online marketing of numerous products, and a consultant for over a dozen fortune 500 companies in the area of business development and internet marketing, I can only warn those that want real online success to take this all with a BIG grain of salt and understand that what Stephen Pierce markets the best is himself, and not much more. His writing is compelling, but those that really understand the online world know that ""when it seems to good to be true, it almost certainly is""...this book is one more example. I have no axe to grind other than to help put a stop to the con men and snake oil salesmen of the internet...they are ruining it for us all with their golden tongues, lies, and books that are intended to make them the gurus and saints they are not."
5,I threw out the third influences in my life!,"Stephen's book has helped me to look at the ""third influences"" in my life and wipe them out! This book is so easy to read. You'll fell like Stpehen is ""talking"" directly to use. Such a short and easy read I highly recommend it! I took the title of a chapter in his book ""Your habits decide your future"" and made a poster out of it for me. It helps me to focus daily on improving my daily habits."
3,Good for reference,"This book is by no means an easy read and I would recommend it for reference only. In his writing, a lot of terms are not clearly explained (if at all) and I got lost many times (despite being very familiar with CSS).If you are looking to learn CSS or just have a guide book, go elsewhere. As a reference book, this would be a good buy."
1,A Book - about sums it up......,"The book is for the really, really just starting beginner. I bought this book thinking that it may answer some of my questions concerning CSS. Instead, it just confirmed everything I already knew. The book was nothing from cover to cover. It not for the compatibility charts in the back the book would be totally worthless (still going to return it though). If I could give this book a negative rating, I would!"
5,"Good reference, right level of examples","This is good material. It is great as a reference and it escapes the danger of being as dry as a W3C specification. The examples are present and they are helpful enough to help digest the content. I used it as more than a reference but I can see that people may have a problem with it. Still, great for what it is."
1,Badly Organized,"Though this guide is chock full of information, he does not build. He right away jumps into a convoluted description of ""selectors"", while including a bunch of things that he says (explain this later), (explain this later). Folks, whenever the author is constantly mentioning stuff that he has not defined yet, it's a bad design for the book. There is so sense of building up--he just jumps into the topic and you feel like you missed something, like there's a chapter missing.I have used CSS for years and was looking for some clarity on a few points of how selectors are used. This book is poorly organized because you feel that he uses stuff in examples that he had not yet explained. For example, on page 9 he jumps into a very complex description of how ""specificity calculation(s)"" are formed. At this point, the reader has not really been exposed to any real examples of simple specificity. So, this is a book for people like me who already understand CSS and not for beginners."
3,CSS is rocket science,"The initial chapters of this book are more difficult to understand than the CSS2 standard, and make CSS seem like rocket science.They assume you have the vocabulary of a member of the team that wrote the CSS2 standard. I know it is difficult sometimes for a writer to imagine himself as a reader of the book, but this book doesn't even try.Skip the initial chapters and go right to the reference."
3,Good quality discs,"The discs are good quality, but over priced. You should be able to find something cheaper."
2,Not a good solution.,"I thought I'd give the iTrip a try, in lieu of installing a CD player in my 1990 BMW 525i.The unit is small, light and cute, and installs easily (a quick software install and then just pop it on top of your iPod). It worked okay with a radio here in the office, but even turning the unit slightly away from the radio would introduce static.So out to the car we go. The unit sits on the center console less than six inches away from the radio -- and the signal is okay until you start moving. Then with every turn, even though the unit doesn't move, there's static.The sound quality is poor, and the signal pickup is so narrow and weak that if you are in any kind of urban area where there are stations all along the dial, you're going to be SOL with this baby. Even though we have plenty of open air here, this was the case for me regardless of how low in the band I went, and how I fiddled with the sound level, position of the unit, etc.It's going back, unfortunately. :-("
2,Cute but very diappointing,"I am using the iTrip made for the old model of iPod. I have found it very difficult to get good sounding music on this thing. I am used to using the iRock (a battery version with only 4 stations) for long drives. It works much more reliably and the sound quality has been excellent. Even when the iTrip works the sound is often distorted at normal volume-- noises from base and unclear sounding. When I drive really far from even a small metropolitan area the sound clears up, but I have much better reception with the iRock."
2,Not very reliable,"I decided to buy the iTrip so that I wouldn't have the hassle of bulky wires that get tangled with the cassette tape adapter for my iPod. Unfortunately, the iTrip has proved less than reliable. It is terrible if you are driving long distances as every 75-100 miles you have to fiddle around with your radio and iPod in order to find a clear station. And, even if you do find a clear station, I have found you only have a 50/50 chance of the iTunes actually picking up the signal. It also seems to drain the battery of the iPod much quicker than usual. The sound quality is mediocre at best and often times tje sound becomes fuzzy unless your iPod is almost on top of the car antenna. I have broken down and bought a cassette adapter...it's just easier. Griffin Technology had a great idea with the iTrip, it just doesn't translate well into practical use."
5,Works really well depending on your car,"I bought the iTrip fm transmitter in December and have had plenty of time to use it under a number of situations. I have also tried a number of other fm transmitters (long before the iTrip ever came out). In my parent's Lexus the sound is excellent. It took a bit of trial and error to find a good station, but once there it sounded great. In my Dodge Intrepid however which has the antenna on the rear of the vehicle, the sound often is poor unless I place the iPod in the back seat or back window. In other cars that I have tried it in, which have an antenna on the hood, the sound is generally very good. Overall I would definitely recommend the iTrip for anyone who wants to listen to the iPod while driving. It is compact, doesn't require batteries, and generally produces very good sound."
1,"pain in the neck, weak signal","I thought this was really a great idea, but the signal is far too weak to sound decent in any car I've tried it in (Chrysler mini van, Subaru Outback, VW bug, Honda Accord). It's better if you're out in the country, but completely and utterly worthless anywhere near an urban (or suburban!) area. Even in the country you'll probably need to change frequencies frequently (ha ha). Additionally, you have to install the broadcast stations on your iPod and it works out so that when you're just trying to listen to your music with headphones these tracks for the stations come on and make a really loud high-pitched beeping sound (same problem just using iTunes on your computer). This could be solved by making a playlist with everything except the stations, but the whole thing is just not worth the trouble. I wish car stereos just had an ""in"" jack."
2,doesn't operate when it's cold?,"I think i've figured something out: I usu. leave the iTrip in my car for obvious reasons, but when the car gets too cold the ITrip doesn't work anymore. Now I keep it with the iPod so it stays relatively warm & therefore functional.Anyone else have a similar problem?"
1,Weak signal,The signal is too weak to work in our car. It doesn't have enough power to play on our car radio (antenna on right rear fender). The only way we could use it at all is to hold a hand over the iTrip so we were the antenna. Even then the signal faded in and out. We finally gave up and quit even trying to use it. For us it was a waste of money.
1,Save Your Money,"I bought this item from a major computer store, and I couldn't be more disappointed. Setup was difficult initially as it kept prompting me for the Windows XP disk (I don't have it, I have a company computer), so I got the drivers from the website and got it running. After playing around with it, I got it working on my home stereo. The sound was marginal at best. In my car, though, it was much worse. I tried many stations, and the signal was extremely weak on all stations. I have a transmitter for my XM radio, and the difference between the two is huge. The problem is not with my radio or with broadcast frequencies, it seems to me that the signal coming from the iTrip is just extremely weak and works best when the unit is literally ""right on top"" of the antenna (not possible in a car). Save your money."
3,itrip for windows,The itrip is excellent if you live in the middle of nowhere. Luckily I do. The initial set up on Windows would have been made alot easier if Griffin simply told you to go to there site and download the windows itrip software for itunes instead of running the out of date CD they kindly supply. Go to Griffin and download it from the support section.
1,Doesn't work with new iPods,"Be warned: this product connects only to the old iPods, that have the firewire port. It does not work with the new iPods that have the dock/USB/firewire connector."
2,"Great at home, terrible in the car.","I have also found iTrip almost impossible to use in a car in an urban area. There is simply too much interference for quality sound, and I have run into antenna issues while using iTrip in both my cars.I must also caution would-be users to not turn the volume up too high on their radio while using iTrip because the device has a tendency to shut off sometimes for no apparent reason (most likely strong interference), allowing the previously suppressed radio static to suddenly come back on and startle you while you are driving."
2,Don't buy from these folks,"I purchased the iTrip but ordered the wrong one. I recognized that fact as soon as I opened the box and saw that it would not fit in the 3G model iPod I have. When I asked the process to return the item for a replacement, the company told me that because I had opened the shrink wrap, they would NOT refund me anything. That is ridiculous! This is the only company that I have ever dealt with who does that. I will NEVER buy from them again and would recommend that you do not as well. They are www.getyourtech.comThey told me I would have to sell it on Amazon.com rather than simply swap out the right product. I should have known since there is no way to contact them other than through email."
2,"Underpowered, better choices out there","As other reviews here suggest, this device isn't very powerful. Unless you are really close to your tuner, it may not work. And it won't work at all in many automobiles. I gave up and replaced it with an IROCK unit, which works infinitely better (i.e. okay at best). Obviously the unit fits the iPod really well and it would be great if it worked well. I also had problems with the station tuning samples--my iPod would often crash playing them, and I eventually got to the point where I couldn't change the channel and couldn't figure out what channel it was playing to. At that point I gave up and tossed it. Don't waste your money."
2,not worth it,"I bought this hoping to use the iTrip in the car, but the signal is terrible. It's so fuzzy its not even worth listening to. If you have a stereo at home and you place the iTrip within a few inches of it, this is the only time the iTrip does anything. Also, having the iTrip stations mixed in with songs is annoying."
1,Dooont buy it!,"Terrible sound quality, the ipod is such a good sound qualityand this product disrespect this same very quality.It gets too much statics. Tried different channels some bettersome worse but never the quality even near to the radio sound.Better buy a cable to connect to the home stereo, quality is perfect and it is only US 7.00. Be away from this product!!"
1,Won't work in a city!,"Dont but this product. Maybe if you live in the middle of nowhere it will work. But you have to find a FM frequency that is perfectly silent for it to work, and even then the quality isn't very good. In NYC or Boston, there are no stations that work well at all. I got this and thought it was awesome for about 5 minutes and then got extremely frustrated as the music sounds horrible on every station around here."
2,Looks better than it performs,"Very cool looking, but I found it frustrating to use. The signal was not consistently good (it worked fairly well in my house, but in the car, with signals coming in and out, it really stunk). I would get it only if there was no other option (no cassette desk, no aux jack)."
2,Not worth it,"The Itrip works very inconsitantly in my car. It takes about 30 seconds with the Ipod out to get it to recognize a station. Then you're adjusting it your whole trip, which isn't worth it for anything closer than 30 mins.Besides half the time your fiddling with the controls unless you're a playlist maniac.Though playing on a home stero next to an antanae is a great alternative to monster cable."
4,Greatest Hits Worth Getting,Not a big fan of greatest hits compilations but this one is actaully worth it. It covers all their best material along with some new stuff thrown in.
5,GREAT JAZZOLOGY RELEASE!,"Here is the tracklisting of this item:* Cherry* Am I Blue* I Want A Little Girl* I Found A New Baby* Baby,won't You Please Come Home* Sunny Side Of The Street* You're Driving Me Crazy* If I Could Be With You* Honeysuckle Rose* These Foolish Things Remind Me Of You* Four Or Five Times* You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You* Jingle Bell."
3,"No bad,...not good, but not bad.","This book is fine for the average person who has no experience with dogs. But for the average gun dog owner, the first half of the book is a waste of time. The last half does have some good ideas, but I would rather spend my money on something more informative such as the writings of Bill Tarrant, especially the Delmar Smith method. It's hard to argue with success and Smith's training methods earned him many national champions. As for this book, I found myself in disagreement with a couple of the training methods, especially gun conditioning. Overall, it's a good book with many great ideas for the beginner."
4,Why Don't We Have More Stories Like This?,"I stumbled upon this book at the 50% off table at my favorite black-owned bookstore. The title was intriguing, the cover wasn't appealing but nevertheless, it was calling my name. I was happy I bought it. It is a wonderfully written story with authentic language that pulls you in and have you believing that you're sitting right there. If Random House or another major publishing house ever gets a hold of his novel, it's going straight to the top!We need more books like this instead of all the hip-hop, gang-banging, streets, drug, prostitution type books. It's a shame that books like this get lost in the shuffle of urban books. A good book like this may never get the exposure it deserves. Like artwork, the author may have to die before his work gains public attention. I hope not."
4,"Lies, Lies, LIes","Brian Egeston's ""Graddaddy's Dirt"" is a must have in the collection. This novel reveals a story full of lies, deception, and broken promises. Egeston does a terrific job setting each scene for the audience.It is like being on a roller-coaster ride full of twists, turns, and stomach clenching stunts. As the lies were told to protect the innocent, a marriage gone sour, and trust broken all in the presence of racism I really had a hard time putting this book down to even eat for fear of missing something. I highly recommend this book."
5,Granddaddy's Dirt Delivers........,"I just finished Granddaddy's Dirt. Congratulations to Mr. Egeston. It's a great piece. I look forward to reading ""Whippins, Switches, and Peach Cobbler"".The author's rich use of metaphors and similes along with his word and phrase choices delivered an entertaining, often funny, and compelling picture of life in the South. At the same time, the story could have been set in Anytown, USA, and it would have been a great story.I have ordered additional copies for friends and I look forward to watching him ""blow up"" in the literary world."
4,"Funny, sexy book, classic Roth!","Roth's alter ego, Zuckerman consoles himself with the company of women when he is coping with a career change. Very descriptive sexual situations with the women he meets. For adult audiences only! Great writing! I fell in love with Roth and read many other books he has written after I read this book."
5,Excellent products and service,"Excellent Products and Service..This is a great company with great customer service-I have been a customer for several years,and very pleased."
3,Its ok,This book was a present. I'm spoiled by the Rouge warrior series so I'm glad I didnt buy this book. The characters in the book go on a series of small missions more suited for the boy scouts than a Seal team.
4,A good read,"If you read the first book, you will love this one.I felt like one of the SEALs in action.Great way to understand the power of these men and what they are about.One of those books you can't wait to get home and start reading.I cannot wait for the next one to be written."
4,"Interesting, but requires effort","This is not a book that is easily read in a weekend. That is not to say that it is not good, or that it is boring; simply that to get the benefit out of it requires a considerable amount of concentration. There are reasons for this, the most important of which is that it is cramed with detail from one end to the other. This is typical of a thesis which has been sent to commercial print, but if you are not forewarned you could be disappointed. For serious scholars of naval or military intelligence (for the book has much content which is not purely naval in character) it is probably worth five stars. For those who want a good read without too much effort, it is probably a three star book."
2,Don't let the cover fool you,"This post is to inform those who may purchase this book thinking it is an IR read with a BW/WM couple. It is not. The cover is not accurate. The female is described in the book as having reddish hair,ivory skin and blue eyes. The male has slightly long straight hair with gray eyes.As for the read...This book is under 300 pages and it is slow. I am an avid reader(3 books a week) and I find myself putting this down because I am bored. The forced connection for the couple is one of the problems. The intrigue is not that good. If you have nothing else to read then go ahead and start this book. If you have something else on you TBR pile then I suggest going for another book."
1,WTF,"FYI THIS IS NOT A BWWM/IR BOOK. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PUBLISHER WAS THINKING OR SMOKING FOR THAT MATTER, VERY MISLEADING."
5,What a nine letter word for...,"Fantastic! A delight for true crossword lovers who like a challenge. When I'm bored with tv, or surfing the net, or just want to relieve the stress of the day, there's nothing more peaceful than a good hot cup of tea and a book of Collectors Crosswords!"
4,"good fit, little long","these jeans are nice. had to hem them a couple inches but other than that i'm happy, 4 out of 5."
3,Too tight in the thigh,"However, if you are looking for a boot cut jean, this is a great pair.They were just too tight on my boyfriend"
2,And your point is?,"Mr. Eliot has done what so many other 'mythologists' have done before him; infuse his ego into every letter of the book. While no one can doubt his grasp of academic mythology/mythological concepts, the elemental portion seems to elude him. He just doesn't seem to 'get it'. Myth shouldn't be only about presenting fanciful stories and then unveiling the obvious metophors within, we need to go deeper and find out why was this particular story created in the first place? Eliot also falls into that other white male scholar trap of limiting his references to Asian and Classical mythology. It seems a near racist act omitting Austrailan, African and Carribean stories and tales. This book has no form or logical progression. While the stream of consciousness style works for some, it did not work here. Buy this book used."
3,good book,"while the book is good, i found it difficult to stay focused. the story is solid and the plot is good, but i found it difficult to keep up with all the names."
1,This is crap!,The luggage handle was broken after 2 days later i purchase. It looks useful but i think the maker do not consider how it get weight. Inside of bag was just cheap ass plastic. I mean It is going to be very easily broken. you cannot put stuff or tools like picture. I literally waste my $50.
3,Yes and then again...,"I was wowed by the first Shaughnessy poems I read -- jazzy, surprising, sexy. But there's not a lot more in a whole book of Shaughnessy poems than there are in a few Shaughnessy poems. Still, she has the tools to expand her range, so this is definitely a poet to watch."
2,Interior with Sudden Boredom,"Typical third-rate Jorie Grahm/Emily D spin-offs masking as profundity and cleverness. Good title and good cover not indicative of emptiness within. Very representative of the new generation of women poets (splorzk, volkman, etc.) who believe that obscurity and a passing score on an arcane vocabulary quiz equals fine poetry. Remember gals that people love Plath for her life story. Without it, she's writing what you write."
5,Nice One Here,"This is a truly thrilling debut! The writer's play with language one senses is not merely ""play"" but a deep interrogating into the uses and meanings and purposenesses of language. her struggles to make sense and meaning out of frangments and nonsense are thrilling and heartbreaking at once to watch. This is what Post-modern work can do. Or Post-Post-modern work. We are soon going to be refering to this poet as one of her generations, and one of the future's, most important."
2,Terminally adolescent....,"....willfully recondite, not restructuring language as much as hawking a private lexicon of buzz words in free association to the admiration of the impressionable. Not for adults, but go for it, kiddies, you could do worse among the glitter hyped as verse."
4,Typical Discovery Channel quality...,"Roy Schieder competently narrates this behind the scenes look at the construction and initial at-sea operational tests of the modern aircraft carrier. Witness the liberal application of elbow grease by the blue collar men and women of Newport News, Virginia as they manufacture and assemble the last Nimitz class carriers of the 20th century: the USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) and the USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76)."
4,Hand and arm shaker,"Very powerful, but heavy and vibrates at full speed. Oversized for my needs, but wanted a blower that will last along time. Don't forget to buy a heavy duty extention cord. Found one for around $50.00 at Wal-Mart, and is even made in the USA!"
4,Toro lawn power vac,"I like the fact that this tool is light-weight and easy to handle in and around the yard and tight spaces. The variable speed feature is a plus. It makes short work of leaf and other yard debris clean-up. My advice is to blow the materials you wish to mulch in a pile and then go to work vacuuming and shredding it. I would guess that this tool has cut my fall lawn work time easily by 50% or more. It sure beats mulching plant materials with a lawn mower; both in time and effort. A bit of a concern would be accidentally sucking up a landscape rock or other small object and then sending this through the unit and breaking the impeller to bits. I would hate to have to replace that. This hasn't happened to me yet, but I would caution anyone to use caution. Perhaps keeping the nozzle several inches off the ground will help prevent this from happening."
4,Good product. Great Price.,Has all the features I was looking for. Takes a bit getting acquainted with the attachments from blower to vacuum. The variable speed function is great.
5,Strong enough,"The blower is a good tool which does its job. However it is almost useless if it gets frosty and leaves get stuck to the grass or the ground. The blower also demands cleaning many times in smaler portions, rather than doing everything at once."
5,Toro Blower/Vac,Very happy with this product. The variable speed feature is extremely handy for our application
4,good machine,"This is my 1st blower so I have little to compare it to. It is quiter than most of my neighbors! It does a good job blowing leaves and dirt off the driveway pavers which is the reason I purchases it. Having a cord is a pain, but that is what you get when you want less noise and inexpensive. ! am very pleases with it."
4,Toro Electric Blower,"I haven't had this unit very long but so far so good. I've used in wet and dry conditions with lots of pine needles and leaves on my driveway, porch and deck. Most of them came off easily. Also the unit is light enough that my 8 year old son can use it. It was easy to put together and simple to use. I didn't give it 5 stars only because the cord can be a pain at times. All in all I would highly recommend this as a very good value for your money."
2,Toro leaf vac awkward at best,"I bought this Toro leaf blower to replace a Black & Decker one that the motor quit working after 4 years of light duty. All the reviews weregreat on this toro, metal impeller instead of plastic and how powerfull this one was etc etc. I found this Toro to be ""Awkward"" to hold, no real balance to it with the bag. The cord was coming out the front (which I kept tripping on and coming unplugged. I found the dial up variable speed power switch to be annoying as well, I liked the Black and Decker 2 speed select switch better. As far as suction power again I thought it had less than the B&D.; If I had to do over i would take a pass on the Toro."
3,Don't buy this if you have big leaves,"The blower part works just great, but if you have big leaves, the suction device gets clogged in the tube. Also there is not as much suction as I would have hoped even for the smaller leaves. I can't say how other brands are for suction, but I definitely would have rather paid an extra $20 for more powerful sucking power."
3,tough conversion,The blower worked well with the variable speed control. The vacuum has decent power. The problem was converting from one to the other. I had to pry the blower piece off to convert.
4,GREAT ELECTRIC BLOWER,"I HATE RAKING LEAVES. I HAVE A HUGE YARD SO I WAS LOOKING FOR THE PERFECT ""PARTNER"" TO GET THE JOB DONE. I AM MORE THAN PLEASED WITH THE BLOWER ASPECT OF THE TORO. IT IS EASY TO HANDLE AND HAS TREMENDOUS POWER. I AM VERY IMPRESSED. I WILL NOT BE USING THE VACUUM AS MUCH AS I HOPED THOUGH. IT WILL TAKE FOREVER TO VACUUM ALL THE LEAVES I HAVE. I DO PLAN TO USE IT TO PICK UP SMALL QUANTITIES LIKE BEHIND SHRUBS, OFF THE SIDEWALK, THINGS LIKE THAT. THE BAG ISN'T USER FRIENDLY AS FAR AS DUMPING IT. YOU MUST UNZIP IT FROM THE SIDE, WHICH IS VERY AWKWARD WHEN TRANSFER THE MULCHED LEAVES TO A BAG OR TRASH CAN. THE UNIT DOES CHOP THE LEAVES AS IT STATES, IT JUST TAKES A LONG TIME FOR HUGE PILES. THIS IS VERY WOMAN USER FRIENDLY AND USER FRIENDLY FOR THOSE WITH WEAK WRISTS. YOU'RE NOT FORCED TO HOLD WITH ONE HAND. THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS TO GRASP IT. I JUST RECOMMENDED IT TO MY MOM AND I RECOMMEND IT TO YOU."
4,Good blower,The Toro is just fine for keeping the sidewalk and garage free of leaves. I've not tried the suction of leaves as yet. It seems to be well made and simple to adjust.
3,Toro Electric Blower,"The item does a very good job of blowing however, the vacuum and the leaf shredder functions are not as impressive as advertised. The vacuum sucks up the leaves too slowly and the metal impeller does not shred the leaves small enough.Except for the blower function, it takes me more time to do the job with this tool than when I use my rake and spade."
3,"OK, a little disappointed","I've never had a leaf blower before so maybe don't know what to expect but this doesn't really live up to the hype. It's a bit cumbersome to operate, but the biggest deal is that if leaves are stuck to brush or plants the vacuum isn't powerful enough to pull them off. Or, if the stem of a leaf is slightly under a rock you have to shuffle the rocks around to free the leaf."
2,Worked great for a week,"I was really happy with it, especially for the price. Just short of a week as I was vacuuming leaves it died. The problem is that this model has a circuit breaker/safety @ 13 amps. or so and when it trips and the machine is dead. The breaker has a shaft that can be seen through a hole on the bottom where the electrical cord goes in through the housing. If the mfg. had made it possible to re set it, you would not have return it to the mfg. or dealer the first two years in warranty and throw it away after the warranty expires."
3,Great to use but didn't last,"I bought the Toro Ultra Blower/Vacuum in July 2008. It worked great for over a year. Then in November 2009, it began to make a few noises and run more slowly. Finally in December, it quit altogether. Toro will replace it, since it's in the two year warranty period, but since it costs so little, it may be easier to just buy another one.jnix"
1,When does advertising become lying?,"I bought this thinking I could easily turn piles of leaves into bags of mulched leaves. No such luck. First you separate the twigs and sticks. Next you make a leaf pile. Then you vacuum them into a cloth bag. Here's where the trouble starts:The cloth bag fills in no time, so you are constantly emptying it.The quoted 16:1 ratio (I realistically only hoped for 8:1) is a total fabrication. More on that in a moment.After filling one leaf bag by emptying the Toro cloth bag about 5 times, I filled a second by hand without the vacuum. After compressing each by hand they weighed the same, i.e., No compression with the mulcher at all!BOTTOM LINE:Vacuum is a waste of time and money. It slows you down and is extra work.Blower is OK, if that's all you're looking for."
2,"Blower rocks, vac blows.","This item is a combo 5-star blower and 1-star bagging vacuum.Comes in very handy to blow leaves, twigs, acorns, dust, etc. off a driveway, carport, porch, patio, walkway, etc.Is pretty much useless as a vacuum for sucking up and mulching leaves. Suction tube CONSTANTLY plugs at the narrowest point mid-tube, so much so that you'll end up preferring to rake leaves up the old fashioned way. Conceptually, sucking up and mulching leaves is appealing notion. Practically, raking is more efficient and preferable, since the tube plugs, and messing with the bag is time consuming and cumbersome. Even if this thing didn't constantly plug up, I doubt I'd use it as a leaf vac. Just too much hassle. I threw out the tube and bag. Blower still going strong 2 years now.Buy a blower only, and take the money you save and buy a good rake."
2,Toro 51599 leaf blower,"This leaf blower cannot be repaired. When the brushes in the motor wear out that's it no one has brushes for this blower, not even Toro. The blower will last for about 2 seasons."
1,Defective switch on Toro 51599 Leaf Blower,"At first I loved my Toro Leaf Blower 51599, quiet, powerful. Then, the switch started to fail. Now, I have to leave it ""On"" and unplug the unit to get it to stop. After searching on the internet I found that many others have had the same problem. I can expect my Toro switch to completely fail in the near future. And, according to others, it is irrepairable. Toro is now selling model #51609. Should I buy it, $75 + $12 for a warrenty? Maybe they've ""fixed"" the problem. Just want to post this to give the consumer a ""heads up"". And Toro, shame on you for not making a replacement switch available!"
2,A better blower than a vacuum!,"Very nice, powerful blower that seems very well made.As a vacuum, you are better off with a rake. It is a slow process and not worth the trouble of switchingit over from blower to vacuum. It's just too much trouble and takes forever that way. I used the powerfulblower to make piles and picked them up with a rake.EDIT: While I was using it for the third time, it made a funny noise and lost 90% of it's power. Got rid of itand went back to a gas powered Echo. The Echo's last a long time and you don't have the hassle of dealing with acord getting tangled up. I'll take the blame for taking a chance on an electric blower. I should have known better!Save your money and buy an Echo instead!"
1,TWO BURNED OUT in NO time...JUNK! DO NOT BUY!,"Wish Amazon allowed ZERO star reviews! Do NOT buy this!First one burned up and DIED right out of the box! First time it was turned on!!*&%!...brought it straight back to the Lowe's where it had been purchased and they promptly replaced it.Used the second one maybe 15-20 times, 10-15 minutes at a time, over 6 months, before it too very suddenly and inconveniently BURNED UP and died. Please note, LIGHT DUTY only, blowing off leaves/pine needles.. it was never ONCE used for the leaf vac function or anything remotely even moderate duty.So it has a 2 year warranty? BIG DEAL, don't WANT another one..DONE. Toro USED to be a good name. Save your money and find something else!"
4,good,"Light and powerful. They should have a better way to secure the power cord. metal impeller is a very good idea,"
5,Toro electric blower/vacuum,"I really like the power and effectiveness of the Toro electric blower/vacuum I purchased on Amazon.com; however, there are two things which I would like to bring to the attention of Amazon and it's readers:1) The Toro box used to ship the blower was broken along the glued seam of the box and luckily no damage occured to the blower, and no missing parts (that I am aware of).2) When using the vacuum configuration, it would be nice to have a wheel on the end of the tube so that the operator could keep the inlet a given distance off the ground. It would save the constant dragging of the tube on the concrete walkways. An adjustable and/or removable small wheel would be GREAT.Overall, I can live with the unit as designed/shipped, but will be improvising awheel assembly in the weeks to come. The box and shipping issue could be resolved by staples along that seam."
4,Good vacuum,I have not used this as a blower so I can't really comment on that. But I have been using it as a vacuum and it works great for that. I use in flower beds with bark so I don't blow or rake all the bark away. It works really well for this. I can adjust the speed so it gets the leaves and doesn't really suck up the bark.
4,Does the job.,"Very lightweight and the price was great! Really easy to use, turn knob adjusts the power; love that.Only complaint, is I wish the vacuum was more powerful.Other than that, awesome product =)"
5,Great little leaf vacuum/blower,"I have been using this Toro for two days clearing my lawn of Hickory, Oak and Gum leaves. It does a great job and, for the life of me, I don't know why I have been swinging a hand yard rake gathering leaves before this. With this item which cost less than $70, I cleared my property of leaves plus mulched them for our flower beds. I'd recommend this Toro to anyone who dislikes raking leaves as much as I do."
4,Review,Over all pleased. Lots of power. Not so sure I would have bought this type because the leaf mulcher can break if something such as an acorn gets sucked up. So says the instructions. They're probably all like that I just didn't think of it. Of course thats all I have is oak trees so I've not yet tried the leaf mulcher and don't know if I will.
4,Easy to use,"I'm very happy with my purchase of the Toro Blower. It is easy to use and very powerful. It does not come with a cord, so you need to purchase an extension cord. Also, the connection to the extension cord comes undone easily. All in all I'm satisfied."
4,mulching ratio,I have a Sears model which is rated for a lower mulching ratio than this model.I think the Sears model does a better job mulching because the Toro didn't shred the smaller leaves of crab apple or forsinthia. It is very easy to detatch the bag and change to the blower option though.
4,Powerful and reliable enough to do the job,"After reading other reviews I figured this was the make and model for me. Having an average size front and back yard, I don't need a commercial solution to leaves, dirt, dust, twigs, and cut grass. This more than adequately does the job with plenty of power to spare for the blower - the variable control works fantastically, although it would be better if there was even a lower setting as well. The vacuum is very good and mulches leaves and grass quite well. All components seem to be well made and fit together nicely and securely. I'd definitely purchase this product again."
4,Toro blower/vac,"I received the product in very good condition, very fast deli. Have not had a chance to use it yet because it is still winter, but going by the reviews is should be fine."
4,Works Well,"This blower works well. The vacuum is easy to install and works well too. The machine has lots of power and really blows the leaves, even the ones that are matted and stuck to the ground and wet. I highly recommend buying this blower/vacuum."
4,exceeded expectation,"the blower/vac had more power then I perceived it would have.jury is still out on how it will hold up, but so far after 2 weeeks of fairly heavey use getting rid of old leaves on a recently purchased yard, it is working very well."
1,switichs wear out,"We have owned 3 of these blowers and none have lasted more than 2 1/2 years, the blowers work great, but the variable speed switch breaks and the company does not offer replacement switch so all you can do is throw them away. If you buy one keep your receipt you will need it. One dealer [ service dealer for Toro told me they were JUNK] Warranty is 2 years do not expect more than that if you have a lot of leaves."
2,"Blower works, Vacuum sucks",The blower works fine. The control knob should be little user friendly and tight. Vacuum doesn't work efficiently. It will take long time to vacuum and crush leaves. You might as well put the leaves in the bag yourself.
4,Toro Electric Blower,"I have had the opportunity to make use of this item on approximately four occasions since it was received. I have been very please with its power and ease of use. The air intake on the bottom of the unit has caused me a minor problem because the suction is from the underside, and it occasionally will suck up my pants or shirt.Can the suction intake be changed to the right side for right-handed people without loss of suction power? Of course, left-handed people would want the suction intake to be on the left side."
3,Good While It Lasts,"I love this blower so much I just got my fourth one. It does a great job while it lasts, both blowing and sucking. I have had three burn out right about the 2 year mark. However, Home Depot always replaces them, so I just keep getting them."
4,Toro 51599 Ultra 12 Electric Blower does the job well,"The Toro 51599 Ultra amp Variable Speed Electric Blower and Vacuum works great! It blows wet and dry leaves on driveways, cul-de-sacs, lawns, and even other trees and shrubs like a pro. The engine is very strong and surprisingly, quieter than most electric yard tools I own. The vacuum is fine for dry leaves especially. The only knock is that it doesn't suck up the wet leaves all too well, so you will still need to get the rake out to put into your yard waste bin. When leaves are dry, the vacuum fairly well and the metal impeller does a great job turning into mulch that you can re-use in your garden."
4,Powerful and Easy to Use,"I have never used a leaf blower before. I have kind of gone overboard and used it inside to blow cobwebs out of corners, dust wicker furniture, clean dust from under the piano, blow dust off the screens. It also works well outside to blow grass cuttings off the driveway, blow dead bugs off the eaves and to quickly clean the garage floor. I have not used the vacuum part yet. I recommend this product."
2,The plastic connnetor on the leaf bag cracked in the first use,"I purchased this Toro blower/vacuum because of good reviews. However, on the first time use, the plastic part on the bag cracked.Very disappointed."
3,OK but not great,"The blower works fine. However, the vacuum/mulcher isn't very useful. It will only take in a small amount of leaves, and it becomes clogged if you try to speed up the process. The small bag fills up quickly, so there is frequent emptying. Doubt I will be using the mulcher very often. The entire unit is a bit too heavy."
5,This thing really Sucks,"I mean that literally. Over a two day period I was able to shred 34 recyclable bags full of leaves. Because of the metal impeller, I was not afraid of sucking up a twig or small rock. I am totally satisfied with this product. Save your money though and pass on the accessories."
5,Worth the extra $$,"After my 4 year old Toro blower finally gave up the ghost, I decided to upgrade and buy the Toro model with the metal impeller (vs. the plastic impeller on the next cheaper model). I've used it twice already, on heavy duty fall clean-ups, and it's doing the job very well. I've used the vacuum attachment both times, and it has sucked up leaves, some light twigs and some small rocks (i.e., pebbles) without a problem. I try not to suck up too many hard objects, but sometimes you can't avoid it. The only thing is you have to remember to feed the tube slowly or it might clog with a lot of leaves, then you have to shut it off for a second until you unclog it manually. But that is not a biggie for residential-type use."
4,second one good so far,"Nice blower, and energetic to be sure, as everyone says--the first one they sent me did actually catch fire under normal use (about the fifth time I used it, after only ten minutes of running), so I did have to waste some time boxing it up to return it--I guess it wasn't actually very dangerous, since one doesn't leave a blower running by itself and is always there to see any malfunctions. The yard smelled like burning plastic for a while afterwards. Amazon didn't comment on my request that they look into the safety issue of it, they just issued me a return label and instructed me that I'd get a free replacement if I returned the defective one within 30 days..."
5,Fantastic Leaf Blower,"I have a quarter acre lot with many trees including two 80 year old willow oaks which produce a huge amount of acorns. The Toro Ultra blower handled it all without a problem. I did not try out the vacuum attachment, but I am sure it would work as well as the blower did. Go for it."
5,Great Product,This is a great tool for light leaf vacuuming and blowing. It's lightweight and easy to use. The vacuum bag can be uncomfortable when it start to get full but I just empty when it's half full. It's a great product for the price. I've had no problems.
4,great value,"very good product so far .lightweight,plenty of power and and a price that is easy on your pocket book,cannot comment on durability have not had it that long"
4,Great Blowing functionality,"Blower is great. Does an excellent job on leaves. The Vacuum does not work as well, as it must ingest not only leaves but all of the other stuff on twigs, gum balls. Each of these objects must go through the motor, and that does not work well."
3,ToroGarden Blower VAc,"This is my third Toro Ultra -I have two homes. I use the Toro Ultra primarily for vacuuming leaves that I have blown into piles using my Black and Decker 18 volt cordless electric broom. I also had a Troy Bilt combo blower vacuum which had a plastic impeller that disintegrated when the vacuum sucked up a stone of about 1 inch diameter (great suction but lousy impeller)I just replaced my first Toro Ultra because the variable speed switch on my first unit lost its ability to shut the machine off, requiring that the cord be disconnected. I'm a fixer and was going to replace the broken switch until I located the part on the internet which had a price of over $40 so decided to buy a new one for $20 more.The vacuum action with metal impeller does a great job mulching leaves and has good suction action even with wet leaves."
5,Super Powerful Blower!,"Really like this. Toro has a super-strong blowing action when you want to really move a big pile of leaves, yet the power is instantly variablefor jobs needing less pressure. Easy to handle and Recommended."
4,"Good leaf blower, mulcher ???","The Toro has good control of the blower speed, is easy to lug around, but its capability as a mulcher is limited. It doesn't handle very large leaves from our walnut tree."
1,Blower died after one 10 minute use,I used the unit on my asphalt driveway to blow away a light sprinkling of leaves and pine needles. It worked great. Only had to use it for less than 10 minutes it was so fast. I pulled it out the next day for the same purpose. The blower would not power up. I tried different extension cords and outlets. Nothing worked. The motor or electrical died. Just a bad unit I guess. I am exchanging for replacement. Will update review later.
4,Toro Ultra big improvement,"As a longtime user of Toro blower-vacs, I am very pleased with the new machine. The most important change is switching from a plastic to a metal impeller. It grinds up debris much more efficiently and, presumably, won't wear down from use the way the plastic impellers did. Also very useful is the variable speed control, especially when using the machine as a vacuum. You can set the suction so that it is not picking up materials that it shouldn't be or raise it higher to catch heavier materials. The only criticisms I have are that the system of switching from the blower to the vacuum function is awkward and difficult - you need a third hand to depress the unlocking mechanism - and having the electrical connection in the front of the machine when you're in the vacuum mode. It would be better to have it on a swivel or come out the side. Otherwise, it's great!"
5,Great Product !,Gives you more bang for your buck than any other blower (gas or electric) I've ever owned. Complete speed control with the variable spped control. I will probually buy a couple more when Amazon get their price at least 10% lower than my local Lowes.
5,THE BENEFITS OF THE TORO 51599 BLOWER/VAC,"THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING WELL DESIGNED.IT IS VERY EASY TO CONVERT FROM VACUUM TO BLOWER.THE DIAL POWER IS ALSO A GREAT HELP IN VACUUMING AND BLOWING. I AM 77 YEARS OLD AND TAKE CARE OF ABOUT A THOUSAND SQ FT OF LAWN, WITH SEVERAL LARGE MAPLE TREES AND A LARGE RIVER BIRCH TAKING CARE OF ALL THIS,SUDDENLY BECAME FUN AGAIN. I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT AT AMAZON .COM THE SERVICE AND PRICE WAS OUTSTANDING"
5,Great!!,"Haven't used it much, but it seems to be a good blower. Lots of power. When the leaves begin to fall, I'll get a better idea."
5,Great product from Toro,"This is the best and cheapest blower I've been able to find. Very high speed blower motor with the option to use a vacuum, all at an unbeatable price. I love it."
3,Good blower but was replacing similar model!,"This blower works well and feels like a high quality unit. I would give it 5 stars, but I was replacing a nearly identical Toro 51592 model that was only three years old and had really been used just two seasons in a small yard with few trees - not to get too technical, but the commutator ring had become rough and had worn down the electrical brushes that feed power to the motor. I'm not sure if this was a ""one unit"" thing or a design flaw. But as you can see, I bought the same brand and as long as it keeps working like it does now, I'll be happy."
4,A sweat machine!,This piece of equipment is just as handy and easy to use as advertised. It is a tough workhorse of a vacuum and the mulching feature is a dream!
5,Toro 51599 Blower/vacuum,This is the first time to buy blower/vacuum.It's working strong blowing by metal blade. I'm happy to have this.
2,"first 1st hour good,","It was working great, I was happy.Then after one hour. The variable-speed didn't seem right from the start.It wasn't Variable at all. It was on slow or wide open. Then seem to lose power. I turned the knob to off. It didnt stop I had to unplug it. I could smell electric short smell. I packed it up and got my money back."
2,Can't pick up pine needles,"Having the metal impeller is nice but ineffective if it cannot pick anything up. Does fine with small debris but cannot pick up long, slender items ( such as pine needles) I ordered this with the intent of not having to rake up my new backyard which is covered with pine needles but ended up having to do it anyway. I like the fact that it is not gas/oil powered and it came with a debris bag.Will keep it, will have to try it out at my mother's house, where there are ""normal"" leaves"
3,Disappointed,"I've had this unit for a while and bought it based on consumer reviews. I've owned a lot of blower/vacuums and the Toro is average. It's a little heavy, makes a lot of noise and picks up leaves and debris when you place the tube directly on top of them which is slightly better than picking it up by hand."
2,Love Toro- just not this one.,"I used it today for the first time, lots of power...it really worked well. Then when I finished and wanted to turn it off, the rotating switch didn't work.Lucky for me it is on when you plug it and I can at least use it."
3,First break after less then 2 hours,"I bought this tool 2 days ago and used it today first time. Mainly I needed the vac function. It is very easy to assemble and the safety features are great( it will not work if not assembled correctly).However, the vac will clog easily if the leafs a just a bit bigger, as its the case with my maple tree.After less then 2 hours of use the plastic tie, used to hold the collection bag onto the connector to the unit, broke.That is certainly an easy to fix problem, but it still takes time, and maybe not even everybody has just in this moment a 14"" tie in the house..I don't know about the 16:1 reduction ratio, but, hands down, it shreds the leafs indeed into very tiny pieces.After all, it did the job, even if not exactly as easy as promised."
4,Great Blower,Great Blower. More powerful than the gas blower I returned to Lowes. ($99 worth ofjunk) The TORO blower is powerful and easy to use. But the vacuum is almost useless.
4,TORO 51599 Blower/Vacuum,Awesome product. Cut my yard work by 2/3.Takes less than 1 minute to switch from blower to vacuum/mulcher. Leaves that would have taken 3-4 big lawn bags full was reduced to fit in the mulcher bag (included).
3,Need a better yard vac,"I kill blower/vacs with frightening regularity. We have desert landscaping (1/2 inch stone). I know ideally debris should be blown off the rocks to a wall or corner then vacuumed up, but I make a worse mess with the blower. The vacuum has too large of an opening to get between large rocks and if I try to clean up stuff on the smaller rocks, they come along and break up the impeller. I do appreciate the metal impeller as it will hold up longer.The new Toro Ultra should have kept the electric cord clip to keep the plug from pulling out of the cord. You can wind the cord around the handle but the clip was better. The variable speed is fine and the bag plenty large. I don't find the unit very well balanced for my short height. And then there is the cord getting hung up on rocks and bushes, %&*#@! Maybe I need to try a gas powered someday."
5,Very happy with this,"When my husband needed to replace the gasoline powered blower he had been using for years, he was concerned that this electric model would not be powerful enough, but he was pleasantly surprised. He likes it better because it is lighter without a gas tank, and because it does not emit noxious pollution."
5,In short works great.,"Does exactly what it says. The blower feature is much more powerful and generally useful than the vacuum, but it is nice to have the option."
1,Piece of Crap,"Don't be fooled by all the great reviews on this blower. I ordered it and used it twice only to have the motor start slowing down and eventually quitting for no apparent reason. you could see the brushes in the motor starting to spark heavily before it died. I sent that model back for an exchange and took my new unit out for a session. Within 5 minutes it started making a grinding noise, and could see sparks under the plastic cover. I stopped it for about an hour to allow it to cool off and tried it again the motor slowed down and quit. So I went to 2 of these units within three trips to my yard. I was not about to try it for the third unit. Either I am incrediblely unlucky or this unit certainly has gone down hill since those reviews by comsumer report was written. STAY AWAY for your stress relief. Good thing Amazon has great Customer Service."
1,LEAF BLOWER AND VAC,Second time my husband used this to vacuum the leaves the bag ripped. The blower/vacumm is good but the bag is worthless. Do not recommend this. The seller was great though.
5,I LOVE IT!,"THIS TORO IS THE BEST MUTIPURPOSE THING I HAVE EVER BROUGHT. I LOVE IT MY HUSBAND AND I USED IT AND IT WORKS GREAT. WE HAVE LEAVES, TRESS, PECANS ETC IN OUR YARD AND IT WORKED THROUGH ALL OF THAT. I AM TELLING YOU IT IS WORTH THE MONEY AND IT IS LIGHT WEIGHT. ALL THREE FUNCTIONS WORKS EXCELLENT."
4,"Very good, with flaws","I purchased this before the leaves started falling this fall. As a blower it has very good power. It also does a nice job of vacuuming the leaves. I think the bag is hard to handle and the mulching is short of the 16:1 ratio it claims, seems closer to 5:1. The bag is pretty small too, I wish it was bigger. Overall I am satisfied with the product, just wish the bag was larger and easier to handle."
5,Inexpensive not cheap,"There's a difference between inexpensive and cheap. I happened to have a long extension cord which is why I chose this blower. If it's just for home use don't know why you would buy anything else. No chain to jerk and low on noise pollution which is important because of our newborn and our neighborhood children. I could use this thing at 6 and not disturb the neighbors. Haven't used vacuum yet so cannot so if that works well but I didn't really buy it for that. Great product, great price."
5,Love it!,Perfect gadget for you if you live in a townhouse close to the woods. We rake more than we mow and this has been a huge time saver for us! Does the job quickly and efficiently. Now we send much less garden waste out to recycling. This reduces what was 3 - 4 bags down to 1.
5,BEST ELECTRIC BLOWER/VACUUM,"Toro Ultra 12 Amp Variable Speed Electric Blower/Vacuum With Metal Impeller #51599THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST ELECTRIC BLOWER/VACCUM THAT I EVER USED, AND THIS IS MY 5th ONE IN 10 YRS.IT BLOWS EVEN WET LEAVES. AND IS GREAT AT VACCUMING AND MULCHING. THE IMPELLER IS METAL AND WORKS GREATI HIGHLY RECOMEND."
4,toro ultra blower,"the blower feature was outstanding and the variable speeds worked well, the bagging feature worked but it didn't shred the leaves as much as advertized."
2,Not that impressed with its vacuum,"I bought this to do vacuuming up of mango leaves. I have no desire to blow things around so I wont assess that. But for vacuuming, the suction isn't very impressive. Only small nearly dried out leaves get readily vacuumed in. Larger leaves or leaves still freshly green are too heavy to be sucked into the tube. So in the end, only about half to 2/3 of the leaves at any given time get sucked in. Unless you like the unfinished look of only half your leaves being picked up, the rest you will have to rake. What's the point of the machine if you still need to rake. I do enjoy its feature of chopping up the leaves into fine particles so it saves on bag disposal and for that I may use it upside down just to feed large amounts of leaves into it for waste processing. But otherwise, the motor seems too weak for massive suction. I realize the limitation on a 15amp circuit can only allow an electric motor so much power, but still this product seems way overrated to me."
4,lackluster vacuum,"Pretty good, powerful blower. Very average vacuum, have to get right over the leaves to suck them up, so cleaning up a mow and trim still takes a while. I like not having to deal with gas/oil, but the cord is a pain. I would easily pay double for a cordless model even if it was slightly heavier."
4,Great yard vacuum for the price,"I am using this tool as a yard vac only, so keep this in mind.The Toro was easy to assemble and easy to operate. It does a terrific job vacuuming leaves while leaving my landscaping gravel undisturbed. I would have rated it five stars if the collection bag for the mulched debris was designed differently. The bag is made from canvas, so the pieces of leaves want to stick to the inside of the bag and to the zipper when emptying. You will also get dust on your clothes where you hold the Toro while it is mulching--it doesn't fully contain the small particles that get sucked up into the tube. For the price I paid, I am happy to ignore these shortcomings because it is making it so much easier to keep my yard neat."
3,"heavy and unbalanced, but metal impeller is worth it","I use the Toro 51599 for vacuuming leaves. It does a great job on dry and wet leaves. It is a heavy unit and the handles make it unbalanced while vacuuming, causing arm and shoulder fatigue in few minutes of use. I found that cradling the unit under the motor housing with both hands make it feel lighter and balanced, relieving the arm and shoulder fatigue."
5,Excellent product,"This leaf blower/vacuum worked perfectly. No problem out of the box. I am glad I chose this one with the metal impeller because when I tried to vacuum some leaves, I could hear the twigs and rocks hitting the blade, and if it had been a plastic blade it would had been broken very soon; but this Toro has a metal impeller which had no problems vacuuming. I plan on buying the accessory that allows you to vacuum into a trash can because the vacuum bag they provide with the unit fills up pretty fast."
5,Excellent - better than expected,I have 4 maples and a narrow strip where they all drop. This leaf blower has incredible power. It does not save time vs raking as much as energy expended. It does exactly what it states and well. I highly recommend it over a gas blower which is a pain to start/stop and much heavier.
3,just ok,its ok for small yards. it does not do wery well with cutting up leaves after a few minutes... the leaves get stuck halfway thru the tube. so if you have a large yard... i would get something more powerful. the blower part works fine. hence the 3 stars.
4,Toro 51599 Ultra is a fine product.,"It's a powerful blower/vacuum. It did a good job for me when I cleaned my front yard with tons of leaves. It saved me hours of raking and bending over to pick up stuff. The only thing about this blower is that you may get very dusty when you use it as a vacuum to crush your leaves. If you're sensitive to dust and don't want to get dirty, you may not want to use the vacuum. The dust blows from the bag and goes all around. A mask and eye protector will help greatly. Over all, this is a good tool to do your weekend fun... :-)"
1,Air Speed / Off switch failed,"I received this Leaf Blower in good time from Amazon but on first use the Air Speed / Off switch failed and the unit will not turn off I had to unplug the unit to get it to stop. That causes some concern for the safety of the unit just be sure to unplug when not in use or away from the blower. Amazon is going to exchange it so good for Amazon bad for Toro. I should say that when working it does very well some minor vibration but less than a lot of lawn mowers. When I get the new one I will post how that one does.This is my follow up. I got the new one on an exchange the service on that was very good, thumbs up. The replacement blower works very well and in my case the high setting is much more than needed in most cases but handy when needed. Thumbs up on the blower. I will not use the vacuums part.JR"
4,Excellent Blower at a Good Price,"I was looking for a strong blower that was also relatively quiet. This electric model from Toro met both requirements. I have used the blower several times and have not been disappointed. While most of the reviews for this product are very positive, several mention the motor burning out after a short time. It is very important to follow the extension cord ratings for both gauge and length when using this product. If you use a light duty extension cord or exceed the length recommendations you are going to burn out the motor."
1,It worked the first time,"The first time I used this Toro electric blower it worked great although is nosier at higher speeds than expected. A week later when I tried to use it again nothing happened. When I called Toro they were very pleasant, and said they suspected a safety switch of some sort had stuck and if I shipped it back they would send me a new one in a few weeks. They do not pay for shipping so I am $22 poorer and back to using my B&D cordless while I wait for a replacement. Not a good intro to my first Toro."
2,Cheap and didn't last,"The bag lasted only 1 year, and the electric motor failed in less than 2 years. For a 1/8 acre yard that is just poor. This is overpriced junk."
2,Disappointed,"I am disappointed with this blower. I purchased this same blower a couple of years ago so it's ""just"" out of warranty. It was used less than a dozen times and well cared for. It still looks new. It stopped working for no apparent reason. To have it repaired would cost more than purchasing a new one. It needs to be replaced but now I'm trying to decide whether to purchase this same model or the Black & Decker which costs a little more. Consumer Reports gave the Toro the highest scores but I feel like a well-cared for, relatively new item should last for longer than 2 years."
2,Not good for extended use,"I bought this blower/vac while living in a home that was on a 40x100 parcel. For that sized area, the vacuum worked well. I recently moved to a home that is on a 75x210 parcel. Unfortunately the previous homeowner did not do a fall cleanup so I had to. The blower performed well for the first 2 hours getting everything into piles. I then switched over to the vacuum and cleaning up the piles of leaves (total of 3 large piles). Halfway through the second pile (3 hours of use), I shut the vac off to empty the bag. When I tried to continue using the vac, it would not turn on. I think I burnt out the motor from exteneded use. It is my opinion that this unit is good for small yards that would not need extended use of this product. It's cheap enough, but buying a small gas version would have been a better choice for me. Hopefully my unit is still under warranty."
5,Toro blower/vac,"I purchased this item as a replacement for a Toro blower/vac that I purchased from Amazon about seven years ago. I was happy with that model and I am happier with this model. I used it mainly for fall cleanup around our pool, shrubs and 185 foot driveway. It works as advertised. I can't imagine a more powerful blower/vac. It even feels a bit lighter than the previous model."
5,This thing sucks (and blows!),"I bought this, based on previous reviews, to deal with leaf litter around my house. It really works! It's much more powerful, both on blower and vacuum mode, than I expected for an electric device. The speed control is continuous, and very handy; on full speed blower, this Toro not only moves leaves, but topsoil too, so it's good to be able to slow it down. On the other hand, full speed is very effective for removing dry leaves from gutters. I am very pleased with this product, and recommend it."
2,Not durable,"There are conveniences with an electric blower for sure, and having a metal impeller when there is a vac function is important, but two things. First, it is wishful thinking to say this is as powerful as a gas blower. Just not so. More importantly, the motor bearings (bushings) just do not hold up. After a year or so of fairly light use, the bearings are starting to go. Such a short life is a disappointment."
4,"excellent buy, product works as noted and is light weight","I was wary of buying this, but glad I did, product is light weight, pretty simple to put together and worked like a charm. Powerful to do the job, even on some of the heavier wet leaf piles that built up from the wind tunnels and left to sit under the snow all winter. I only used it for several days in the spring to get the yard done and will use it again come fall. It made reaching under the front porch easy and fast. Leaves used on were 95% oak and maple. I would buy this product again."
1,Out of Balance,My previous Toro was the same model and lasted four years until the motor gave out (I would have given it 5 stars). I purchased a new one and immediately noticed this one had a vibration and more noise even at low speeds. I returned it for another of the same model and this one is better but still not as smooth and quiet as the old one was. I will be returning this one and looking for another brand.
2,Another one with a defective switch,"As another post stated, the switch has also failed me. It stays on a low setting and doesn't turn off using the switch. I have to pull the power cord to stop the motor. This thing is going back.Other than that, this blower is strong and does what it is supposed to do - except turn off."
5,Just the tool for a woman gardener!!,The Toro Ultra 12 Amp Electric Blower/Vacuum #51599 was a treat to find and use!! In the fall it will pick up the leaves that your rake can't reach and in the spring it allows the fragile new plants to remain intact and not get damaged by use of a rake. I LOVE this gadget!!!! I'm a master gardener with arthritis and the Toro vacuum allows me to get out there and work without strain to my body. I only wish I'd found it a long time ago!!
4,Best One that I've Found,"The first issue is the cord, but you knew it had one before buying it. The second issue is the tapered suction nozzle; it clogs when attempting to such an entire pile of leaves by setting it down on top of them rather than sweeping it by them numerous times. Other than those two small oddities, this is the only way to go for a leaf blower/vacuum. I bought one as a present for my in-laws that have quite a few oak trees, and they loved it; so I had to buy one for myself. Operations are easy and self-explanatory with the speed knob and the steel impeller makes quite the difference in cleaning out jams- it just eats everything up that is smaller than bush branches. It has gone through two falls of operations and still going strong, so I can't complain- especially for the cost! (Much cheaper here than at Lowes or Sears)"
5,Electric Blower - Vacuum,"I am very satisfied with this product. Have now successfully and satisfactorily used it numerous times for blowing leaves off driveway, roof, etc. It is also good for grinding up leaves and using them for mulch. Great product."
4,My wife loves it!,We've used it only as a blower so far but it does a great job. Materials seem to be adequate. Good blower speed.
4,pretty good for the money,"My first blower/vac. I gave the blower a 5 star and the vac a 4 star. I have only used the vac/blower twice - but it performed well. It pickes up/vacs small leaves and branches with ease. The vac did struggle with larger ""wet"" leaves, but the blower does a great job moving about anything smaller than the dog with ease.I would buy this unit again."
4,"Impressive, low cost blower","This blower is quite powerful and seems to be well worth the average cost. It's lightweight and not too loud. The only negative I can say so far is that the electric cord pops out occasionally while in use, but I have solved that by looping the cord at the plug and giving it some extra slack so it doesn't pull out so easily. It's sort of fun to use too, my teenage son seems to enjoy carrying it around and doing yard work for me!I would definetely recommend this product."
5,Toro blower/vac,"What a wonderful product! Lived up to all the reviews I read. Nice design,portable and above all else no gas motor to deal with! Love this product!"
2,Buyer Beware,"I bought this blower in September and have used it 6 times. It is a terrific leaf blower/vacuum, but the bag is already coming apart and this is not an uncommon complaint. Unfortunately, I can't even find a replacement bag online. I had a Black and Decker Leaf Hog blower/vac for over 5 seasons before the bag went. Instead of replacing it, I bought the Toro and wish I hadn't."
3,did not make it a year,I used this to mulch the leaves and deposit into leaf bags. It did not even make it to a year old and the motor burned out. I did not have the bag on my shoulder and I guess maybe the bag was too heavy sitting on the ground and pulled on the plug and all of a sudden it just stopped working. The bag was about three quarters full. I checked the heavy duty extension cord and the outside outlet and all worked fine. I took it apart and found the motor totally burned out. It was good while it lasted but for $69 I wished it would have made it at least two years.
1,JUNK,Blower worked fine under very light duty (leaf blowing only. no mulching) for EXACTLY one year and then burned out. Sounded like a battery operated tool slowing down over about 5 minutes until it totally stopped. I expected way more from a product with the name TORO on it. Just more foreign made crap.
3,Bag lasted 2 hours,"This thing does a fine job of sucking up leaves, even wet ones. But I pulled mine out of the box, and got two hours of vacuuming in before the bag developed a small tear near the nozzle. I emptied it probably 5 times. The rest of the product seems pretty well made, but I'll bet I only get another session out of the bag before it needs to be replaced. Not cool."
1,Built in problems,"So, I was excited to get a new blower and this variable speed Toro looked like it was perfect for the job. It was less noisy, it had power, a nice plug, was light, but problems soon took place after a few weeks, The variable power control started going out after a few uses and it is now intermittent and rendered the blower useless. So now I am back to using my old unit, I would suggest the two speed unit model a standard switch.."
4,So far so good....,We have recently moved to San Rafael and this has been a season of lots and lots of leaves... I had purchased a new vacuum in September and the bag blew-up within weeks. I purchased the Toro 51599 after reading reviews and it is doing leaf duty on a daily basis. The bag is a bit flimsy but not like the other... So far I'm only using it as a vacuum (I still have the other blower) and have difficulty taking the bag off to empty it. Leaving the bag on makes emptying it very awkward. BUT it gets the job done and I'm satisfied.
3,The Toro 51599 Ultra 12 amp,The Toro 51599 worked fairly well for me. I still ended up racking a lot of the leaves into a pile before attempting to suck them up. I would have preferred the bag to open on the bottom instead of on the side. The side zip makes it a little more difficult to dump the leaves.
5,It's the best!,"I've enjoyed this blower so much, I've given it a few times as gifts to family and friends, they LOVE it as much as I do!Way to go Toro for engineering such an awesome reliable product! I loved the last Toro blower for ten years, this one - with the variable speed ... is 'wicked good.' Love it!"
3,too heavy for us to use,"It may be powerful good blower, but for us it is just too heavy to use especially vacuum parts. Actually we did not try, we just assembled."
5,Great Leaf Blower,"I usually go to [...] for product recommendations and they said this Toro is the best, so I bought it. This is a great leaf blower. Plenty of power and light weight. Worth every penny."
3,Better blower than a vac,"Prior to this, I had the B&D; blower/vac that I bought locally. After about 2 years, it just sort of fell apart. I bought the Toro because of the metal impeller. As a vac, I liked the B&D; model better. The Toro doesn't do much to grind up the leaves - important IMHO for more rapid composting. Also, the suction tube narrows about half way up. Leaves tend to plug there. After about four uses, the connection between the bag and the bag attachment is leaking bits of leaves and dust.On the other hand, the blower function is great. It move lots and lots of air. The variable speed control is handy. I wasn't expecting to use the blower feature at all, but have found it quite helpful.All said and done, for my purposes, I'd buy the B&D; again. It's less money and does a better job of reducing leaves. However, if you're looking for a blower, this seems to be a good one. If you don't need a lot of reduction, the metal impeller has sucked a lot of leaves without any signs of wear."
1,Toro Leaf Blower -- Addendum,"I purchased this Toro Blower through Amazon in February 2008. Amazon did great job with delivery, but the blower just died! I used it about once a week to blow off the sidewalks and driveway for about 30 minutes each use. Yesterday, it simply died. I am very dissappointed in the short life of this product. I only used the blower funciton, never as a mulcher. In fact, bag and hose are brand new. Very dissappointed in Toro, and of course, the 90 day warranty has long since expired. UPDATE: November 2008. Since my original comments, I learned there is a two year warranty. Toro graciously replaced my broken blower with a new one. Thank you Toro -- good produce and excellent service. I now give 5 stars *****, but Amazon's feedback system won't let me change the rating. Joe"
4,My first leaf blower -- what a great tool!,"I have 4 mature oak trees on my property, and for the past 4 falls, I have manually raked the leaves. After reading about this blower in Consumer Reports' August or September 07 issue (it was ranked best), I decided to give it a try. I am really happy with this blower. I mainly use it to vacuum/mulch the leaves, and it does a good job. My only real complaint about this is that the vacuum attachment is a little too long for my 5'5"" stature, so I'm somewhat clumsy with it. The shoulder adjustment strap also drops the bag a little lower on my hip than I would like. Other than that, I haven't had problems with it. Because of these two nuisances, I'm giving 4 stars."
5,Indispensable tool for fall cleanup!,"I bought this since last fall. We have been very happy with its performance. We were going to hire a contractor to do fall cleanup. Instead of wasting hard-earned money, and with the added benefit of burning calories, we are doing it ourselves this year. This little sucka works simply sucks up everything in sight. Thicker branches are minor annoyances, but a couple tap usually clear the pathway rightaway.We use the blower to gather the leaves and the vac to sucks them up. The trick is transferring the content from the vac bag to municipal leaves bag. If you compressed the filled bag sideways (zipper closed, of course)before the transfer, the vac bag fits in much better with much less chances of tearing the bag. I hate raking leaves, this tool saves me lots of time!"
5,Electric Blower,"Toro Ultra 12 Amp Electric Blower/Vacuum #51599It is the best blower I have owned. It is even better than the 4 cycle gas powered Ryobi I am replacing. Ligther, much less noise, more power and I can adjust the air coming out. I would recommend this to my neighbors and family....! I have not tried the vaccum feature yet, but I feel it is going to work as good."
3,JJ's,Good quality but very loud... when you start the motor you can hear anything at all also you can't use this for more than 1 mins continuously because of so loud noise...Good quality product but Price should be bit less and better to find some way to avoid the noise like (by using ear burd) :-)3.5 out of 5 ( this could be 4 or 4.5 but because of noise I can rate more than 3.5)
5,Leaf blower,I have used this item several times since it was purchased and it has always done a good job!Best electric blower I have ever owned.
5,Leaf Master,"What a terrific machine. Saves my back and takes no time at all to mulch all the leaves. I thought maybe the power would be minimal since this item is electric, boy I was wrong! One of the best items I have bought. Thanks for a helpful addition to my yard."
4,Best of the three I've owned,"I've owned three blower/vacs (Two were black and decker) and this is clearly the most powerful and best at mulching leaves. The others had hard plastic teeth and this one has metal ones. Like all the electric powered ones I've used, it is best on dry material, but the Toro did handle the damp leaves better than my other leaf vacs (fewer clogs, leaves chopped up better).My main reasons for not giving 5 stars are these two:1) Many of the electric yard tools I've used have some way to secure the cord so that it physically cannot unplug itself. This would be useful.2) Though I can't say any have been terribly comfortable, I've yet to find a way to hold the vacuum and bag that is very comfortable. The end that exhausts into the bag tends to kink if I hold the bag in a way that is most comfortable."
5,toro blower,Excellent product...very impressed with the power it had..light to hold and just as powerful as the pros..Liked my neighbors so much that I bought one!!!
4,Nice product,"Made light work of 2 pickup truckloads of shredded leaves. Easy to assemble, lightweight, good power. A bigger bag might be my only suggestion."
3,"Works as a blower, not as a vac.","I had hopes for this because from looking on Amazon this seems to be the most powerful electric blower/vac you can buy.Alas.. I am disapponted. It works great as a blower and hence the 3 stars. However like every other electric blower/vac sold, it works horribly as a vac. It has less suction than my dyson vacuum and easily gets jammed.It can pick up a leaf but doesn't have the suction to pick up sand, or the tiniest twig, or an acorn. It is faster to bag leaves by hand.This isn't a comment on the quality of the product though. I've tried numerous electric vacs and they just don't work. Still.. I hoped for more.It seems to be good quality and if you want an electric leaf blower than I recommend this.Just don't expect to be using the ""vacuum"" portion of this. I really think these should be advertised as blowers only."
3,"Good vacuum for some, bad for others","I suggest if you are buying this for a leaf vacuum then be careful if you have small twigs/branches on the ground. It would have worked great if I didn't have twigs and/or branches laying on the ground by the leaves. I am sure this would have been fine to use if it is leaves only. I gave it 3 stars for it's quaility of build, but unfortunately not practical for me to keep. In my case it jams up every 30 seconds."
2,the good and the bad,"This is my third Toro blower in the last 5 years and it might be the last.the metal impeller is a great ideal and so is the variable speed. But the darn thing does not last ,motor keeps burning out. Next time I will look for another brand."
1,GOOD FOR TWO USES AND NO MORE.,"THEToro 51599 Ultra 12 amp Variable-Speed Electric Blower/Vacuum with Metal ImpellerBLOWER WORKED WELL TWICE AND THEN NOT AT ALL. PROBLEMS WITH THE VACUUM WOULD ALMOST BE UNDERSTANDABLE, BUT THE PRODUCT DIDN'T LAST LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO TRY THAT FUNCTION. TOTAL LIFE TIME: 30 MINUTES. IT IS A DISAPPOINTMENT."
4,Toro vac/blower,"Blower is fine, vac is slow with large leaves and stems. Good buy and simle to use. Metal impeller helps."
4,good value,Works very well as a blower although the knob to turn on the power is not as efficient as one that you could press and control that way. The vacuum has to be on high to really work. The price is rigfht.
5,Toro Ultra,"Very easy to use. Parts easily changeable. Can get a bit heavy, particularly when bag fills up, but then again, I'm fairly small. Shipping was very timely. Would highly recommend."
2,"Great leaf blower, for as long as it works.","With a few big trees on my property, the leaf blowing cleanup routine is a weekly chore at my place. I found this leaf blower for a reasonable price at Home Depot, and right out of the gates was very impressed- Easy to use, strong force on the blow, it got the property cleaned up in a flash. Loved it! However, fastforward to 3 years later- My 2nd Toro leaf blower just died this morning. Started smelling melting plastic, and then with a choked, coughing, wheeze it died. Cue billows of smoke coming out of the unit. I'd call my use of this product ""average"". Weekly cleanups of a 9000 sq.ft. property. And with the my 2nd unit, I didn't even use the vacuum function (seemed to put a lot more wear and tear on the unit). That said- I've burned out 2 of these in the last 3 years. So, so long as you're happy with maybe an 18 month lifespan of your purchase- Go right ahead! This thing did work really well until it died..."
3,It's OK,"I bought this Toro as the pack rats chewed up the bag on my Yard Man whichI hav had for a few years. Sort of disappointed, you have to turn the powerknow all of the way up to pick up anything. Seems it is awkward to hold when using itas a vacuum and it gets heavy pretty fast. It's usable but my Yard Man was a betterunit and easier to switch between blower and vacuum. Should have just bought a newbag for the Yard man."
4,Good Machine but poor quality bag,"This performs quite well, however if you suck up certain items (such as small pebbles or sticks, twigs, etc) they can blow through the bag, the zipper side is what fails, there seems to be some design flaw/weakness, so I would buy a backup bag or two if you can find one. I use it for cleaning my garage/driveway/sidewalk and it does a very good job, plenty of suction."
1,It lasted for 3 minutes,I purchased the Toro Blower/Vacuum last fall. I assembled the unit and turned it on to see if it worked - it did.I assembled it again on April 5 this year to really put it to work. It worked for about 3 minutes before stopping with a strong electrical burning smell coming from the motor housing. It never came on again.I returned it to Toro for repair or replacement.
3,worked good,but it didn't last long. The motor burned out a lot sooner than it should have. I enjoyed it as long as it worked ok.
3,Not very powerful,"My previous product experience was with a Toro. It has good power and has lasted for many years and is still powerful. I felt that I needed a second blower for a different home and so I checked Consumer's Guide to see what was one of the best products - that was how I chose this Toro blower. I am very disappointed. It simply does not have the power to do a great job. I would describe it as very mediocre. Perhaps this one item is a ""lemon"", but I will refer to the Best Buy Products listed in Consumer's Guide with greater skepticism in the future."
4,Great Power,Powerful Blower/Vac!The variable speed is a great feature since you can control the speed you want.The only Con is the way the the Leaf Bag empties out. It should have been on the bottom instead of the side for easier disposal.
4,"Great, but don't cords suck",This is a great product best in class. It's just a shame no one can make a great cordless blower that lasts more than a few minutes without a recharge.
4,3 seasons and still going strong,"Bought this blower/vac 3 years ago and have used it each year to clean up mostly maple leaves. It works very well as a blower. The vacuum is a bit tricky to use and is time consuming, but the benefits for mulching and composting make it worth it, in my opinion. We can save more crushed leaves in a limited space than if the leaves were just raked and piled. And they break down quicker, making for a nice soil supplement. It helps to vacuum the leaves when they are dry and have been sitting on the ground a week or more. If they're wet, then it's important to move more slowly and pick up only a few at a time to avoid frequent jamming. All in all, a good lawn tool for the money."
3,An annoying change to the product,"I bought Model 51599 as a replacement for an older model 51591 Toro that died after about 5 years of use. The 51591 had a molded ""bracket"" (for lack of a better term) on the back of the blower where you could loop the extension cord to keep pressure off the connection between that cord and the blower. I found a reference that described to this as a Lock-Cord and a reference #100-9088 in the manual. This reduced the number of times the extension cord would be pulled loose from the blower. It didn't stop them completely, but did so a large percentage of the time. The new model does not have such a bracket and the connection pulls loose ALL the time. This is VERY annoying."
4,The little red engine that could!,Liked it well enough to order a second unit to keep at our cabin in the mountains. Watch out for one thing. I accidentally pulled the extension cord loose from the wall plug some 75' away. I set the unit on the gravel beside the driveway and went to plug it in. I neglected to turn the dial to the off position!!! When I plugged it in it started up and began sucking up and spewing out gravel. It looked like a little gatling gun and the noise was horrendous!! I made the 75' sprint in record time!
4,Plenty of Blow Power,"Toro Ultra 12 Amp Variable Speed Electric Blower/Vacuum With Metal Impeller #51599This must be one of the most powerful electric blowers around. And if you ever want to pick up and grind leaves it does a good job of that with the metal impeller. I did find the suction tube to be too small for large Magnolia leaves, but it works well with anything smaller. I found it a bit difficult to manage with the bag slung over your shoulder. It is a bit heavier than my previous blower, and the handle configuration also made it more difficult to handle, but then perhaps with more use I'll get the hang of it. For blowing power, however, it can't be beat. And best of all, it is much quieter than its gas powered brothers which I find to be soooo... annoying when the neighbors crank them up in the morning."
3,Toro Ultra Blower / Vac,"This is a great light-weight powerful unit. I only have used to blow leaves into piles and then shred. It does a great job on shredding leaves (until you suck in mulch or sticks). It is light and easy on the back after doing your average sized yard.I would recommend for yards with a lot of tress.UPDATE:Just over two years later the unit died. I wish I could say unexpectantly, but it was the mulching activities that did this unit in. The unit as a blower only is great, it can not handle the stress of crunching an acorn or twig here and there. The motor shaft literally got out of balance and burned out."
4,Impressive,"This lightweight blower/vac is very nice. I just used it to clean up my yard with leftover leaves and it really packs a punch. The vac is also nice and mulched a everything that I through at it. The only problem I have is that the bag is starting to pull from the plastic insert piece. And this was noticed as soon as I took it out of the plastic bag.All in all, a great buy."
2,Doesn't last,"I've been through two of the 51599 models. I can't comment on the vacuuming. I've only used the blower function.They work great for 12-18 months and then die. The two-year warranty requires mailing the entire unit back to Toro. You cannot take it to a local dealer.Due to the expense of mailing and the effort required to package the unit (and my laziness) I haven't tested the warranty service.It's a great blower if you're prepared to buy a new one every year. If not, look elsewhere."
3,Good Little Blower!,The Toro 51599 Blower is a good product for small jobs. The blower works great but for large amount of leaves it is probably quicker to use a rake. When using as a vacuum this product is heavy and awkward to handle. Is great for blowing grass clipping after weed eating and works well for cleaning up flower beds and small amounts of leaves.
4,Toto 51599 Ultra 12 amp Blower/Vac,"This machine is everything reviews have said it was or would be. Plenty of power, vacuums leaves without any problems, breaks leaves up so they are compacted, easy to handle even though it has an electrical cord, and no smelly exhaust fumes. The only reason I cannot give 5 stars is because I think the plastic body of the blower could be sturdier and the leaf bag should unzip at the bottom of bag, not the side. This would make dumping leaves easier There is a clip to hold the leaf bag in place and it seems a tad weak. I have used it 4 times so far and I am very pleased. Could recommend without hesitation."
3,meh...just okay,"Relatively quite. ""Mulched"" leaves - not even close...and I was was vacuuming paper thin, big, yellowed poplar leaves. 50% leaves made it through unscathed, 25% torn, 25% mulched. Lots of stopping in the second half of my four hour first/only use to unclog sticks/mud/debris from propeller area. Worth the purchase price but not all it was cracked up to be."
2,Doesn't have the power it did new.,"This is the first item I have ordered from Amazon that I haven't been completely happy with.I ordered this blower to replace a Black and Decker brand that was falling apart after years of use and then didn't use the new one much at first. When I did try it out it seemed to have a lot of suction, more than the old one. I was beginning to think it was just my imagination after using it for a while and having to go over and over leaves and clippings to get it to suck them up. But then I found my old blower in the shed and realized I was right. The old one (with the plastic impeller) works better and is lighter. It's probably been two years since I bought this one so I have no hope of returning it. I'll keep using my old blower until it dies completely.This tool may work better as a blower, but as a vacuum for leaves and yard clippings it's very frustrating to use."
4,Electric blower/vacuum,"We got the blower when expected and the service was excellent. It was our first electric blower, having used gas for years, and it works great."
4,Handy Toro Blower/Vac,"The Toro Ultra Variable Speed Electric Blower/Vac is a handy tool. Overall, it has the power needed to handle vacuuming and blowing leaves. My only complaint is that the leaves clog the tube a bit too often."
4,Toro Ultra 12 Amp Variable Speed Electric Blower Metal Impeller,"Good price, free S&H. Noise and vibration at high speed-- a bit higher than I'd like. Good points-- highest speed is not required most of the time, has a metal impeller which is very important if you bag. I had to replace a plastic impeller on another Toro blower after just one bagging. Toro recently had a recall on some of there blowers with plastic impellers. Given a choice-- I'd never buy one with a non-metal impeller! No gas, no oil, no maintenance! I have used blowers with 200 Ft. 12 gauge, extension cords; 14 and 16 gauge cords will work depending on current draw and plugged into a GFI outdoor outlet. Of course the only inconvenience is dragging the cord!"
2,Hard to change-over,"I bought this product based largely on user reviews, which were overwhelmingly positive. My experience doesn't match. I find the change-over from blower to vacuum a fingernail-busting struggle. Vacuum power is poor - it would be easier to get out the broom. Blower performance is only so-so. The unit is somewhat ergonomic when blowing but vacuuming is a hassle. It does pick up poultry feathers, but doesn't chop them - they pass right through. Not terribly noisy, and doesn't vibrate, but not the best purchase I've ever made."
5,Easily one of my favorite tools.,"I bought this blower over the summer and couldn't believe how well it works. It's the most powerful blower I've used (limited experience) and the vacuum works great as well.I've actually been using it to remove stone from the front landscaping. It blows them out of the divits my rake won't work in, and has made that task a great deal easier.I have no complaints, and I'd suggest this to anybody in the market for one."
5,So Easy,It has met all my expectations. Easy to use and operate. Reduced the number of yard waste bags we had to use to dispose of our yard waste. Should have bought one sooner.
3,Christmas gift for wife. HA!,"Leaves on the lawn bother my wife but I could not care less about them. She likes working in the yard and I want her to be happy. This was a great idea and it works well. However, it is quite dirty if you get down wind while using it and that limits it's fun factor. It really is fast and effecient but just a mess to use. If you wear contacts or have hayfever, I would recommend you wear eye protection and a mask when you use it."
5,"Lightweight, Quieter than a Gas Blower & No Stinky Fuel Required",My husband has gone through many gas blowers & I was tired of them not working after one or two seasons. Plus they made a lot of fumes when he used them and I would need to close the windows. He was skeptical when I purchased this one for myself and now he uses it all the time. It is lightweight and powerful enough to meet our yard clean up needs. I love it because it is light enough for me to use & it is not as a loud as a gas blower.
5,Back saver,"I was a little hesitant to purchase another TORO product after an electric snow blower I purchased 2 years ago failed totally to work and customer service had no explanation (Home Depot provided a full refund). However, I just used this machine on leaves that had been felled by a 3 day rain storm. Despite the leaves being waterlogged, this machine in blower mode moved the leaves into a pile and in vacuum mode sucked them up, shredded them and bagged them for me. Moving these heavy, wet leaves with a rake and bagging them by hand would have broken my back! Instead, the TORO allowed me to clear my lawn with little physical labor. Thanks TORO!"
4,Happy Buyer,I am very impressed with the Toro Blower/Vacuum... The Blower is VERY powerful and is adjustable. The vacuum is also very impressive. The only down side so far has to be the cord.. We have a huge yard and the cord only reaches so far. (I suppose I can solve that by buying a longer cord) Also the vacuum is a bit time consuming versus just picking up the leaves by hand. You do save a lot of time by blowing the leaves in to a pile instead of having to rake them though.Overall we are extremely happy!
1,Vac Dies After Only a Few Months,"Bought to use as vac only (have another blower). Worked pretty well (not great) for several months. Then it all came to a screeching halt (literally) when that seemingly powerful metal impeller was stopped forever by an acorn or a tiny pebble. After paying $75 for the thing it died quickly with just normal, residential use. Took it to have it repaired by the firm that services our other yard equipment, and were told that it would be cheaper to buy a new one. We are going to buy a Black & Decker vac, with the leaf collection tube, as our neighbors' B&D product has worked well for years. They are in the market for a new leaf bag for theirs. That's the kind of reliability we need."
2,worked good for around twenty times used,"I bought this same style blower a couple years ago. Only used the blower, not the mulcher. Maybe used the blower 20 times. (I have a Weedeater blower that I also use) The toro worked great until the brushes, that still looked new, started arcing and the motor slowed down and then quit working. The comutator actually came apart. I liked the variable speed control and it had plenty of power but I certainly expected a longer life from the machine!"
3,Vacuum Bag Wears out Quickly,"This is a very good, fairly light weight blower and vacuum. I use it more as a vacuum for leaves than a blower. Unfortunately, the seam on the underneath side of the bag where it attaches to the plastic fitting rips out. I took the first one I purchased back after the seam failed completely after only 2 months of use, and the dealer (Sears) replaced the entire thing (I just wanted a new bag, but they said they had to replace the entire unit).Now I'm on the second bag, and it is failing in exactly the same place and in exactly the same way. Its out of warranty, so I will have to patch it up with duct tape, or purchase a new bag (which runs about $25, which is about 33% of the cost of a whole new blower).Too bad that this very decent leaf vacuum (which is great for getting fall leaf debris out of flower beds, shrub gardens, etc) has such a shoddily constructed bag)."
1,Burn-out,"Used the blower a total of 3 times. Not as good at vacuuming as you might think. Rake and trashcan much easier. Burned out on its third use. Not once used on heavy, wet material. If you have a decent sized yard, cord is a drag."
2,Died twice,"UPDATED DUE TO CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCEBought this in september 2010. It died a month later. Got a replacement in november from amazon, which just died today. It's less than two years old and amazon said toro won't honor the warranty because the original purchase was september 2010, even though the product i got in november 2010 is still less than 2 years old. (Rated 1 star after this)After calling toro, they said that they do actually honor the warranty for 2 years, even for replacements, after you receive the replacement. Thus, I was able to take it to a local service center, they diagnosed it and had toro replace it with a new one. It's nice to know that I will also have a two year warranty on THIS replacement, too. I love this blower when it works, but it's hard to recommend something that's doesn't last 2 years, especially when toro's had two chances to make me think the failure was an anomaly. (Upgraded to 2 stars after this)"
4,serves it purpose,I researched and found the metal propellers in this product a distinct advantage. Not disappointed but a little heavy. Mulches medium to finer when bag is almost full.
1,Toro 12 amp electric blower,The first time the blower was used it lasted for less than a minute and smoke started coming out of the engine. I returned the product to an authorized repair center and still have not received the unit back. It has been almost 4 weeks since it was dropped off. Now it is snowing so it doesn't do me any good...
1,Toro Ultra?,"Well this was the 2nd Toro blower that I've owned. The first had the plastic impeller and didn't hold up well processing the small twigs that are pulled through when using it as a leaf vacuum. I replaced it with the variable speed with the metal impeller. It worked great for about half a season of cleaning up leaves from a quarter acre lot. it started to overheat and smelled of burning electrical parts. I turned it off and it never worked again... now it has a new home in the landfill... I now have a black and decker.. it's a piece of junk too.. I firmly believe that all of these things are built to fail, and the manufacturers make them as disposalable products that are supposed to be replaced yearly."
1,Toro blows and sucks,"The Toro Ultra blows and sucks, both literally and figuratively. It works great, WHEN it works. My first died inside of nine months, and I didn't use it that often, maybe once every two weeks. Its replacement died at just over two years. Learned my lesson, going to another brand next, see if it does any better."
1,Died after first use!,I used this product for a total of 1 hour and then it stopped working. Nothing more to say except buyer beware. When it did work it provided a reasonable level of air flow but dragging the cord was a bit of a problem.
1,"Worked great, for one season","Bought this model about a year ago. Used it a dozen times, it worked great.... until it didn't. Now it won't turn on, even though the safety latch is in place, seems like a circuit issue but I don't know. Now I can either chase a warranty claim all over town or trash it, pretty disappointing."
4,"Best for the money, but design flaw!","It's hard to beat for the price but here are its flaws.Plastic construction seems less than sturdy (probably can't take any drops of any kind without cracking its brittle casing) and it's a little noisy but perhaps that's picky for any blower, notorious for making a lot of wind and a lot of noise that annoy neighbors (like some politician!?).Its most notable flaw is that its propeller faces down towards the ground rather than be entirely enclosed with side vents, as in the Black & Decker BV2500. So, during use in a yard, it sucks up any leaves that happen to be close to its underside (esp. if you tilt it to navigate around shrubbery) which then have to be removed/disentangled by hand to keep the blower happy. In brief, it would have been a AAA product if the propeller was not so exposed so you could tilt the blower around vegetation without accidentally sucking up tree leaves that block its airflow."
5,A sound investment for a blower,"Wasn't sure if I was going to get a corded blower, but it was well worth the investment. Don't have to worry about a gas blower and maintenance. Just plug this one in and it is good to go. Ends up saving me a lot of time not having to sweep up yard debris. Definitely worthwhile to get a blower with a metal impeller as well. Haven't used it as a vacuum yet, but looking forward to it this Fall."
2,Not as Good as I Had Hoped,"This blower vacuum was not as I expected. The motor housing is pretty bulky and heavy compared to a lighter cordless blower (Black and Decker for example which I will likely buy eventually instead). Although I liked the dial feature to control the speed of the impellar with precision, I found the power of the blower too much for my needs in my average suburban backyard with leaves from three medium-large trees. The main reason I purchased this over a cordless blower was for the vacuum. I'm 5'7"" and the vacuum attachment was a few inches too long so that I couldn't allow my shoulders to carry the bulk of the weight when using it. Moreover, it turned out that the time to blow and suck leaves from the patio was not much different from simply blowing and sweeping them up. Lastly, the fabric bag is cheaply made and seems prone to tearing, likely needing replacement or repair after a season of use."
5,Recipient seemed thrilled.,"This was a gift. The recipient seemed thrilled, especially with the metal construction. Hope it works well for him. Toro 51599 Ultra 12 amp Variable-Speed Electric Blower/Vacuum with Metal Impeller"
4,Toro Tuff,"I got my Toro blower this fall, just in time to try it out. I had been shopping for blower vacs for about a year, but did my research this summer. It really is veriable speed, has good suction and can blow damp leaves. Drawback, no way to hang it on a wall in the off season. I love it-no regrets."
1,Aus buyers beware.,Would love to review the product as it looks and seems awesome. But i now find out i have to spend $120 on a current converter!. My fault. Will never know the joy.Tim
2,Don't buy as a mulcher,"I have large flower gardens with shrub borders, and wanted a tool to make leaf removal and mulching easier and faster that using a rake and free-standing mulcher. This doesn't do it."
1,Worked great the first time,"The item worked great the first time it was used. However, the second time it was plugged in nothing worked. Contacting the manufacturer for a replacement."
1,Beware of this model,"I have been in the landscapeing proffession for 30 yr.I""ve used the stihls gas blower backpac. (the best if you can use it)The little toro""s when i can""t use the gas.I used the small toro for years, till the plastic parts on it broke.I upgraded to the red super blower.They worked fine for about a year, then the switch that controls the rpm started to act funny.It was either on or off.I thought well i""ll buy another one, engine ran fine, switch bad,Probably 2 cent chineese part, easy to replace, can""t buy it.I know own three red super blowers, all have bad switches,I need one for my buisness, cause old rich women keep calling up their friend the mayor and complain about the blowers.If they were out of the house doing something usefull, they wouldn""t notice them.I need another blower after about a year of use.The black smaller toro lasted 3 years of heavy use, 15 hrs a week, 52 weeks a yr"
2,Over Rated,This blower vacumn is over rated. It is heavy and cumbersome to handle. Does not do a good job of vacumning up leaves. Don't waste your money.
5,Fantastic value,"I was a skeptical of purchasing a electric blower thinking it wouldn't have enough power to do the job, in this case I was wrong. The toro leaf blower has more than enough power to get the job done, and it does so without the noisy motor of a gas powered leaf blower. The variable speed controller is excellent as you can decrease the strength to help wrangle the leafs into manageable piles, although the position of the variable controller could be better as it takes a second hand to adjust the speed a thumb control would have been nicer but it's not a big deal. The only down fall of this unit is the electrical cord you have to drag around, but for the price and how strong this blower is I can deal with it."
5,Works great.,The vac works great and with free shipping was actually cheaper than Home Depot by $10.00. How can you beat that. Saves a lot of bending over when you are picking up leaves.
4,Performs well so far,"It's still summer so I can only say that it works very well blowing off grass trimmings. In the fall I will find out how it performs with leaves. I did try the vacuum to remove old leaves from a patio area; it worked but it's not very fast. I would not use it to vacuum/mulch lots of leaves in continuous operation that might be overheat the motor. With the 12 amp motor, I am using it with a 12 gauge, 15 amp 100 ft extension cord which does cause a lot of drag in pulling the cord. Much harder than with light duty 14 gauge cord that I used with my old blower. I also recommend using ear protection against hearing loss."
4,Storm machine,"This is a great buy for the money, I was looking for a 13 or 14 amp Like the electric chain saw I have. I wasted alot of time looking around for a better one but, this is the best on the market for the price at this time. Whatever you do don't drop it, it will break. I have a 100 foot heavy duty extension cord I use with my electric tools."
2,Died too soon,"As others have said, it works great as a blower. But you can pay $30 to get a decent blower. As a vacuum/shredder, it fails. Literally. At the end of filling three tall paper lawn bags, it would not start again. Nothing. The Toro website says it has a 2 Year Warranty, but that you need to contact the ""retailer"". What? Not Toro? So, I came to Amazon and can find nothing here about warranty repair. I'm sad to see a manufacturer passing the buck to the retailer on warranty repair, when we all know that retailers typically shrug their shoulders when you bring a broken item in. They always say, ""We just sell it. You have to take it to the manufacturer for repair"". I'm curious to see how this runaround will work out."
5,great leaf vac/blower,"Haven't tried the blower as yet in the month that I have owned it, but the leaf vac works better than I expected. It is somewhat bulky to carry, but I overlook that because it works so well. Noise level is minimal and I know that my neighbors are not bothered by the sound of it."
5,Good Product,"The blower worked perfctly out of the box with a minimum of assembly. I find that if I loop the cord around the motor housing before plugging it into the blower, you do not have to worry about the cord becoming unplugged as you pull a long length of cord around the yard."
2,Motor burned out,"I have the previous model, 51598. I used it about 4 times over two years at my house. I turned it on for the first time this year, and after a minute or two, I heard the RPMs reducing, smelled something like burning plastic, and saw smoke coming out of the motor vents. The bag was empty, there was nothing in the tube, and the impeller turned freely and was undamaged. I called Toro and they said it was probably the extention cord's fault. It's out of warranty, and they don't sell a replacement motor. So at $70, that comes out to $17.50 per use. If you're going to throw it away and buy a new one every two years, you might as well get a cheaper one."
4,Good so far,"So far this blower/sucker is working as good as I thought it would.Much less noise than my gas one, which is why I got it.I had hoped the blower low speed would have been a little lower, but just have to remember keep the nozzle farther away and all is good.I was thinking of getting another blower nozzle and cut it shorter to solve this shortcoming.No problem with the sucker except the bag does fill up fast.I don't think it mulches as much as stated.It's way lighter than my gas one.Easy to carry and move around.Converts from blower to sucker very fast and easy.Overall I rate it very good.Only had it a short time, so we'll see how long it keeps working."
2,Great but gets you dirty....,The Toro was bought for me to use in cleaning up my rose beds. I used it and it had good vacuum pressure and did a good job the only thing was it filtered dirt all over you.
4,Absolutely fantastic,"It is just as described, Just make sure you get a power cord for it, and it was delivered in great shape, Just that being in the city I was not too keen on it being left on my front entrance, so that anyone could get at it, However thankfully I was home, I did my neighbors lawn and mine as well, Bag was a little heavy with the leaves but figure your picking up allot more than you would if you was bagging them yourself, No problems and would recommend it to anyone, Neighbor wanted to borrow it but not out of my sight, I will go and do it for him as he has a small lawn, It was everything it said it was, and amazon is the bomb let me tell you. I only gave it a 4 star rating as the fact it did not require a signature when dropped off no other reason."
4,compared to B/D 4500,"I purchased the Toro 51599 and universal leaf collector and compared it to my neighbor's Black and Decker 4500.Toro is a bit awkward to handle and doesn't have a very good shoulder strap (it's connected to the collection bag). Luck it is lightweight, otherwise, it's bulky design would be difficult to handle. The variable speed knob turned on at the slightest touch so be careful! If you pick-up wet leaves (all of mine are wet) the impeller housing gets clogged with ""mud"" easily and impedes the turning of the impeller. It needs to be cleaned regularly.Even with those problems, it seemed stronger than the B/D and the bag was much easier to empty.the universal leaf collector with collapsible 42 gal bucket is a wast of money. It can seal well enough for the vacuum to work well. See other reviews for how to make it work with a regular garbage can.This is an inexpensive garden tool that has made my battle with leaves much easier. I spread the resulting mulch throughout my garden."
2,Not impressed,I selected this electric Toro mainly to pick up oak leaves from a large oak in my back yard. Machine may be satisfactory as a blower for larger leaves but it is a failure in suctioning up oak leaves. Even at highest power you have to hold the suction nozzle against the ground and still it does not gather all the leaves. It just does not have decent suction power. I realized after using it five times now that it is actually easier and faster to simply rake leaves into piles. It is also far more efficient than repeatedly going back and forth over a tiny area with the nozzle of the vacuum.I realize many have given this item a good review but they could not have been dealing with oak leaves that cover Florida from Nov. till spring. Also the handle arrangement is poor.
2,Poor shredder,Poor shredder. I have had three of these machines that failed just at warrantee time. The shredder reduces about 10% at most not hat is advertised. The blower and vacume is adequate but not very good. Raking is quicker. Next time I will not replace this with the same product and seek another make.
3,"Slight quality issues, might return","Only used this item once in the vacuum/mulch mode. The bag was not fully sealed to the plastic coupler where it connects to the unit, which caused it to spray the debris back onto me. Also where the pick-up connects to the unit is not very secure. Using a back and forth motion to push the leaves around caused some flex to occur at the secure point. Besides that, the unit does have good suction and the metal impeller seams durable. I wouldn't rate this item as good as a lot of people have. I will have to keep on searching for a better replacement possibly."
4,As Expected -- Good blower,"I like it. Converting from a blower to a mulcher is quick. The noise level is a bit high, but as expected. The device is pretty light weight and easy to maneuver. I've had for almost one year and have had no problems."
3,Toro 51599 Ultra 12 amp Variable-Speed Electric Blower/Vacuum,"Assembly was easy. I bought this to use just for vacuuming leaves, since I have another unit for blowing leaves. It's not good for large cleanup jobs, since you have to keep emptying the chopped up leaves. It's good for small cleanup jobs. It doesn't chop the leaves fine enough, so I end up putting the leaves in the garbage instead of my gardens. My mower does a better job mulching the leaves, and much quicker. I didn't even use this thing this year, because it's easier to pick up the leaves with my rake and garbage can cover. Hovering over a pile of leaves makes my back hurt after awhile. The connection of the bag to the unit isn't very good. I had to use duct tape for a proper seal, or breath in dust and dirt. Manufacturers should try using these products before selling them to get the bugs out, and in order to create a better design."
5,Great Product,"Easy to operate and change between blower and vacuum modes. Weight is not a problem. Have to remember to stop and empty leaves in bag. Might want to consider attachment for collection of more volume. The job was so easy I got inspired to get the leaves out of both neighbors front yards, too."
4,Good Blower,"This was my first leaf blower. I bought it because of the price, metal fan blade, vac / blow combo. It doesnt really have ""mulching"" benefits but it does do a good job at picking things up and blowing them around. I've had it about one year and havent had a problem with it."
5,THE BEST BLOWER MONEY CAN BUY! PERIOD .,"I have heard and read so many horror stories with blowers. Smoking, sparking, making crazy noises, breaking down, not starting, etc. NOT WITH THIS ONE! The metal impeller is great! And you are good for I would say 200'. CONSUMER REPORTS BEST BUY! Now I see why, I really wanted a gas unit, but after reading around all of the review sites I was scared, and why pay over $300 for a decent gas blower?(that will break down) when you can HAVE THE BEST FOR UNDER $70?Very easy to use and very powerful, I have no complaints, it even moves wet leaves, I have yet to try the vacuum kit, but judging from the air this thing moves I don't think there will be any problems, so unless you need to blow 30 acres, this is the way to go."
4,good value for the money,"This machine is fairly easy to use, very easy to change from blower to vacuum function and back, and does pretty much what I hoped it would. I've used it mostly to blow leaves into piles and then to mulch them using the vacuum mode. I've been careful to avoid sticks but it handles small twigs fairly well, and the few times that it's clogged, it's been easy to clear. I didn't notice the vibration while using the machine, but the next day had some achiness in my hands. This machine cost me a fraction of what the lawn guy charged to clean up my leaves last year so I've been very pleased with it."
4,Blown Away,"With the on-off/adjustment on the top of the unit, you can use as little or more blower strength. The force this unit creates will move almost everything. I've not use the vacuum/shredder attachment as yet, but autumn is around the corner. Having said that, it is the ONLY reason I didn't add the fifth star to the rating. To say the least, I am very pleased with this purchase thus far."
3,Costs a Little Over a Dollar per Use,"For residential use, this unit will last a little over one year before the bearings start to go out. If you consider what it costs and how often you use it, it costs about one dollar per use before it starts that 'precession vibration' so common in today's 'budget' products."
5,Good product,"I've not tried using it as a mulcher, simply because I live in the PNW where everything is wet 10 months out of the year. But it helped me move around tons of wet leaves, and the apples off of my neighbor's thrice-be-damned tree that fall in our yard. It's sturdy, light weight, less obnoxious than those gas-powered abominations."
2,variable speed knob failure,"I bought the Toro 51599 in May. Now it's December. While I was blowing leaves for the final time this season, the variable speed switch no longer worked. It won't turn off and it won't change speeds. Now I can turn it off only by unplugging it. Is 7 months the normal time before failure? Bummer!"
5,Very impressed with the performance,"I read nothing but good reviews before I decided to buy, and I wasn't disappointed. It's very powerful, and it even works when the leaves are wet. Must go a bit slower, but it still vacuumed and chopped them. The large bag size makes for less emptying. I highly recommend the Toro 51599 Ultra."
1,Bad Vac / Good Blower,"I bought one of these a few years ago as a replacement for a really old B&D; Blower/Vac based on its consistently high CR ratings. Used it one year before the poorly designed safety switch for the vac attachment developed too much clearance and the unit would constantly cut out while trying to vacuum up leaves or whatever. I tried numerous jury-rig fixes to eliminate the problem without totally defeating the safety function. All to no avail.Bought a B&D; Leaf Hog while struggling with the Toro as my wife just wouldn't use the Toro because of the frustration of the power cut outs. The B&D; leaf hog went 5 years before burn-out. Last year we decided that the Toro was just taking up space in the shed as neither of us would use it anymore. So into the trash it went, though with only a year's worth of real use on it. What a waste of money. What a crappy safety switch design. We decided we'd never buy another Toro blower/vacuum based on our money wasting experience with this unit."
2,Toro 51599,"I bought this thinking it would pick up Acorns. We had a bumper crop this year. I was dissappointed. It would not even bring one 1/4 wy up the extension.Next I tried leaves, I was disappointed in this task as well. I would have thought at 230 MPH it could pick up leaves quicker then this. It would be faster to use a rake."
3,Toro 51599 Ultra 12 AMP-Electric,"I returned this product w/o using it as i mistakenly ordered the electric and my yard is too large to be using 100+ feet of power cord, so I di not use it. Thank you, PLDiehl."
3,Does not meet expectation,Toro Ultra 12 Amp Variable Speed Electric Blower/Vacuum With Metal Impeller #51599The leave blowing performance is the same as the Toro 850 I got 10 years ago. It does not meet my expectation that the newer top electric blower should be much improved from the old Toro 850.
1,Complete Scam,"Another product to prey on the credulous. The people who promote this stuff should be locked for fraud, and their assets seized and given to a cancer research institution. It is incredibly easy to test the claims this device makes, yet all the believers don't require evidence, just hope. For hope, you can spend the $20 and get it as long as you don't seek evidence. Unlike the books claims, these techniques have been studied extensively by researchers and shown to not work. You will also find in the upper levels of this scam individuals convicted of fraud. On the lower levels, you'll find dead cancer patients and broke families. Find any academic search engine and look up ""Rife Machine"". For a cure and hope, seek conventional treatment and save the wish thinking for the children."
1,The Cancer Cure That Worked,"Who knows whether the original machine worked. It does not exist. All other 'Rife' machines are rife-less. Pure quackery. Put your money, heart and hope elsewhere. If it worked, we would all know about it. It might cost more, but we would willingly pay for it. Do we really think that there is a hidden cure for cancer. Ridiculous. There are so many looking for it. We would, collectively find, expose, publicize and pay for it. No problem. This is a money-maker for some sadly misdirected people, who are happy to make a profit off of those who are in desperate need of help."
3,Dining Armchairs,Unfortunatly one box out of 2 arrived badly damaged but Visiondecor picked it up with FEDEX and refunded me the money immediatly! Thank You!
4,Good buy,I bought this penlight and another more expensive one for school and this is the only on that works and continues to work. It was cheap and has held up throughout my clinical rotations. I would recommend this product.
1,Does not work.,"When it got here, it was exactly as described... it just didn't produce light. I guess it is a hit and miss product to buy. Good luck."
4,We laughed out loud!,"We just love the gang! I'm so glad that I bought this! We enjoyed the weekend watching this dvd. We couldn't wait to come home from work and watch some more. Just good funny Sunny stuff! Laugh out loud and belly laughs! They are such funny actors! Dee's character is so perfectly slapstick! They all have a wonderfully funny talent! 3 cheers for comedy! Man, I'd like to watch a lot more funny stuff like this! Any suggestions for similarly funny stuff, let me know! I've seen all 7 seasons of Sunny and love it!"
4,Needs to go to free instant video,"I love this show. So much that I have purchased all the previous seasons. But no more. Why? I bought all the Breaking Bad seasons. They are all on Netflix now. I bought all the seasons of Sons of Anarchy. They are on Netflix now.Netflix does not have Sunny yet, but I am sure they will soon. In other words I am through paying for something that will be soon available (although with a subscription) elsewhere."
3,Diluted Genius,"As a devout fan of Its Always Sunny I am always entertained at how they take current issues (north korea, gas crisis, abortion) and through their brilliant comedic genius pervert it into hilarious episodes. While this one pursued some notions about fear factories of media, obsession with storm and survivalism, overall it wasn't bad and it wasn't memorable. This seasons has seen its share of hits, misses, and soso's. This one falls into the latter but even at their most mediocre I still find Its Always Sunny to be better than any other show out there."
4,"Comedy is patchy, but at least now we know why Mac is fat!","This episode has some legitimate high points, but leaves a bit to be desired as far as a creative and gut-busting plot.If you are a tenured Always Sunny fan and have followed the character development throughout the seasons, you will love this episode simply because Rickity Cricket, the Waitress, and deadtooth all make an appearance, which brings back so many good memories I am chuckling as I write this. The biggest problem I have with this episode is that it is part 1 of a ""to be continued."" The plot here isn't funny or developed enough to keep drawing it out...HOWEVER (and this is why it gets 4 stars), if you have been wondering all season why Mac is so fat, this episode finally lets it slip! That moment alone is worth the price of admission."
4,This Has Grown On Me Over Time-HS Reunion Episode,"The only reason I started watching this show was because Danny DeVito was in it. But then I started liking his sidekick, Charlie Day, really well too. The other three took me a long time to get used to but over time, I have come to like this show. This is one of its better episodes where they all return to their high school reunion. It immediately becomes clear that they were all considered massive duds. They try to become cool at this late date. Dennis has even convinced himself that he once WAS cool. But, boy, it is an uphill battle for this quintet to be considered cool by anyone. Of course, that is their charm. You can reliably count on them to wander into disaster after disaster. If you've never watched it, this high school reunion two parter is a very good place to give it a try."
3,We should not be committing crimes based on beliefs formed 2 hrs ago,"A sleeper, but really good. At first it didn't hit me. But I watched it again, the next afternoon. I was eating penne rosa and almost choked because it was. . .damned funny after all. . ."
4,Wasn't bad,"This one wasn't bad, but I think that compared to the first 2 it was a little ""tame"".Still funny, just ""tame-er""."
3,This one was only so-so,"As much as I like this show and Danny Devito, and Glen Howerton, and Charlie Day, this was not the best episode of the season. . . ."
1,Getting Hard to Watch,"This season started of strong, but seems to be running out of ideas, and humor.I may have laughed once or twice...and that was somewhat forced.I hope it gets better."
1,"Love the show, but this one STUNK","I'm a huge Always Sunny fan and enjoy pretty much every episode, but this one was by far the worst one I've ever seen. It's told in flashback form, about Frank and his brother in the 60's and 70's. There isn't really one funny moment except for clips of Frank indulging in a substance he helps his brother sell. This season has been good so far, but this episode can be flushed down the drain."
1,Not funny flashback,"I have to agree with the other reviewers - this episode wasn't funny. I usually enjoy this show, but this episode couldn't end soon enough. It feels like the writers ran out of other options and so they went with a flashback episode. Is this the beginning of the end? I hope not. I suspect that this episode isn't very funny because Danny Devito isn't that funny when he's on his own. I watch this show for the interactions between the other characters. I could take or leave him (& his character)."
2,"Wow, what a decline in quality.","I loved this show. Seasons 1 through 6 were wonderful.This episode was horrible. Beyond a doubt the worse I have seen.I usually bust out laughing when I watch IASIP, but I just had a couple tiny chuckles with this episode.The whole premise was absurd and poorly acted. They definitely ""jumped the shark"" with this episode.It's a shame. I won't be purchasing any more episodes."
5,Excellent,This is one of the best seasons yet. The trip to the Jersey Shore episode is brilliant! Highly recommend this season.
4,Too Funny!,As always...Great show! The super-witty writing is hilarious and the gang is back to their old antics. Can't wait for the next season.
1,Terrible terrible !!,"I just recently bought season,6 of my its always Sunny, and the qaulity is terrible.. its like its scratched or something.. I want an exchange please or refund . Thanks"
5,ALWAYS love Philly!!,"The gang is still funny, what more can I say? The DVD was shiny. I guess the packaging is a little cumbersome, but you only deal with that once. Why haven't you bought it yet?"
2,"Great show, mediocre episode","I have to respectfully disagree with the reviewer who recommended this episode. As a fan of the show, I really didn't like these two reunion episodes, & when I recommend the show to new viewers, I would advise against them watching this episode as an introduction to the show. I had hoped that this episode would salvage the last one (a to be continued), but sadly, IMHO, it did not. Every TV series occasionally has an episode or two that aren't up to par, & I'd suggest that this episode did not reflect what a great show it's been (& it hopefully will remain)."
1,After 6 glorious seasons they phoned it in.,"I saw the faux family portrait they showed for this season and laughed my ass off. I was so looking forward to this but what a crushing disappointment! This show has been so original and funny for 6 seasons but it's just not anymore. The jokes are flat, they rely on being gross instead of funny (not that gross isn't funny, but that's all they've got this season). It's just plain dull.They should have stopped after 6 seasons and it would have been remembered for the uniquely funny show it was, instead of the uninspired, only-doing-it-for-a-paycheck show that it became."
1,Won't load,"I downloaded a few episodes, but this one in particular freezes on the Loading page and won't procede any further."
3,One Mistake Away From Being a Classic Episode,"I was pleased to discover that this episode focused on the real Jersey Shore as opposed to the horrible show of the same name. In fact, the only references to the show ""The Jersey Shore"" were to deride it. There are some wonderfully classic ""Sunny"" situations here such as Dee getting her hair stuck on an amusement park ride, Charlie being enamored with the Ocean (and questioning its nature) and the return of the waitress in a most unexpected manner.My one glaring problem with the episode was the very graphic depiction of two homeless men engaging in intercourse. This could have simply been implied or even partially shown. I felt that to show one man's butt exposed as he thrust into anothers just went too far. It really makes it hard for me to enjoy the episode overall. The producers should really try and achieve a balance where the comedy itself can shine instead of going to such depraved levels."
4,Raiders of the Lost Ark,"America entered a conservative period after the Iranian hostage crisis. Ronald Reagan became president, and Raiders was the big movie. It is a throwback to the serials and politics of 1936. Harrison Ford is archaeologist Indiana Jones. The Jones character is a fedora-wearing, bull whip-slinging, adventurer who fights Nazis while traveling the world in search of ancient treasures. The Ark is the chest which held the Ten Commandments. The Nazis want it because legend has it that any army which possesses it will be invincible. Indy's droll instincts save the movie. Shooting the sword-wielding Arab was unexpected. The close calls and narrow escapes are numbing."
5,Raiders started it all,How can you have this as one of you favorites of all time? If you are an action here fan!
5,Great CD of contemporary arrangements to classic hymns!,This is the best CD I've bought in a long time. It consists of classic hymns sung by either a male or female singer with minimal accompaniment. They inspire a deep sense of worship and praise. I highly recommend it.
2,Disappointment,"I was looking for old-time hymns to enjoy now and be played at my funeral later this year. They have taken the wonderful old songs I loved in church and changed the tunes, and sometimes even the beat. This may be the modern Christian music, but they should leave the old songs alone. They were beautiful as they were. If you are looking for old songs, this is truly a let-down."
3,Battery Design Fragile,"While I have appreciated the mobility of the LKA10 Headset, the delicate plastic hinges that attach the battery to the headset dialing box are very fragile if the unit slips from your clothing and falls or is bumped. A 3' tumble from my desk that doesn't harm my mobile phone has completely shattered this integral connection piece making the unit unusable until I purchased another replacement battery unit. So far I've bought three over a two year period - well before any of the batteries showed any sign of wearing down. To me this is a hidden cost due to a design flaw that reduces the LKA10 Cordless Headset's value significantly for me."
4,Escape to another place.,"I first became aquainted with Tracy Chapman while listening to ""New Beginnings"". I was instantly captivated by her voice and the mood of the music. I have since bought every CD she's come out with including ""Matters of the Heart"". This CD is quite different from her earlier work but yet still very much Tracy Chapman. ""Bang,Bang,Bang"" takes your mind's eye to the hopelessness of a boy that had his opportunities taken from him due to our cultural fear and ignorance. One cannot listen to this song without being deeply touched. My favorite track on this CD is ""I Used To Be A Sailor"". The melody instantly transports the listener to a place outside the realms of this world. While not my favorite Tracy Chapman CD, it is certainly a ""must have"" for anyone who wants music that touches their heart and soul."
4,Very sturdy and works great,"This is a great bottle jack that has worked perfectly for me on several lifts. The only thing I'd like to see improved is the handle, which is a bit loose when assembled. The release function works very well and is adjustable with a screw, letting you lower the car (or whatever) in a controlled fashion."
4,"Worth $30, but not $40.....",Bought this to lift a porch and it worked pretty good. It is definitely a cheaper item in my opinion. Not sure it would last all that long with regular use.
1,Why did your husband destroy?,Why would masters be destroyed? why not donate these Musical recordings to Smithsonian museum ? If they were of so little value why are they being bootlegged now?
3,"Works OK but ""layers"" are a problem","This bug zapper's 2 ""insulation layers"" supposedly serve to protect you, but they also trap the bug in the layers so that even after it's dead the body is stuck and still sparking. I don't know about you, but I do not want to have to pick the little fried husk out of the layers so I can continue using it. Tapping it on the floor or garbage can to dislodge the body left my zapper dead. I also used the zapper without the ""insulation layers"" and never once accidentally shocked myself so I am going back to using it. Bugs beware! Is it wrong to imagine a little voice screaming as the sparks fly? Nevermind."
2,worked fine until it stopped working!,"I guess mine was also defective. It worked fine for awhile, then stopped working. I changed the batteries to no avail."
1,Cheaply made product,"I bought this item and within 2 weeks the power button stopped working, rendering the product useless."
1,defective,Worked for two days. Now works sometimes. Good idea. Too bad quality is so poor. Battery door falls off and light blinks on and off. Waste off money.
1,Broke apart on first swat.,"I got this as a gift a couple of months ago, and finally pulled it out of the package. I put batteries in, pushed the button on the side, and nothing happened...No light or anything. I figured I would try it on a fly and see if it worked even though the light didn't illuminate. I saw a fly, pushed the button, swinged, and....CRACK....the handle broke apart. I was left holding the batteries, and the racquet fell to the floor. One star is too generous."
4,Okay Zapper!,"Not as strong as I thought It would be!I believe it kinda knock the bigger bugs out,but they eventually comes to.I say it's pretty good at zapping the bigger bug unconscious so you can step on them I guess."
2,Electric fly swatter,"I ordered three of these. Two of them didn't work. Amazon replaced them no questions asked. However they sent conflicting e-mails. One said not to return the defective ones for health reasons and the other said to be sure and return the bad ones so my account doesnt get charged. Still waiting to see how that plays out. I'd already thrown away the broken ones. The product seems to be working, but I don't have high hopes for its longevity."
1,Disappointed,Bought two to replace basic bats that we had had for about six years. Returned one bat for replacement because it did not work. The replacement bat also did not work. Not a very good average. Will stay with the basic in future.
5,100% effective bug zapper,"I bought this bug swatter for my boyfriend to replace an older one he had. It is much better than the older one, has a protective shield from fingers and is more powerful. I am easily able to zap bugs--even really big, fast flies. Even ones that are too fast to swat--I have just held the swatter in the air while pressing the button & the fly usually flies into it on it's own within a couple minutes!!! GREAT PRODUCT!"
1,Waste of Money!!,"I ordered two of these bug zappers and neither one worked!!Later, I bought a different brand (from a completely different manufacturer) and they work great!I'd never recommend the iTouchless 3-Layer zappers"
4,swatter,"this is a fun product ! it is much better than a fly swatter, and fun to use. works ok with small flying insects. would not try it with a moth, Just imagine what it does, not my kind of thing.keeps the little gnats out of ones face."
3,Happy Daddy,"Not the safest item. If you touch the center you can get a shock. Nonetheless, my husband, and all men who have seen it, love it, as they bat away at bugs. Kind of tennis on the patio.Kills bugs effectively.iTouchless 3=layer portable electric power bug fly swatrer"
4,"Good fit, easy to install.",They were easy to install and look good. THey do make cleaning the windows and drying them after washing a bit more tedious.
5,"Very secure fit, and Great looks.","I'm so glad I went with the in-channel type. They look so much better and are much more secure in there fit than the outside channel ones. Easy to install. The look great, and after a few days seem to ""settle"" in. What I mean by that is that they were a little ""sticky"" at first while rolling the windows up and down. They would make a rubbing or squeaky sound when the window would seat in. But now the windows are seating in smoothly.These cost a bit more than the outside mounted ones but are worth it. I don't have to worry about losing one, or warping because the tape came loose. I see that on vehicles all the time and it looks terrible. I don't notice a big increase in wind noise at all. It did reduce ""wind whip"" in the cab of my truck for sure."
5,Good fit on Tacoma.,Easy installation. Good quality window deflectors. Looks good on my truck. Lets me open the window when it is raining.
2,Product ok if your own a Tundra!,I purchased the deflector set for a Toyota Venza AS ADVERTISED. I was sent a set for a Tundra and thus unusable. I have used Weathertech in the past so the product is good if you get a set for the right vehicle. I guess they don't make deflectors for the Venza. The company was easy to work with for the return.
5,Three thumbs up!,"This lens is even more than I expected it would be. There is no chromatic aberration (the WC-24 did have some). It is very well corrected for a ultra wide angle lens (I get no curving of straight lines), the horizon is straight even when placed close to the edge of the frame. I wish it had a lens hood and you can't put filters on it but it is a great addition to my Coolpix 5000."
4,Cant Beat It for The Price,"I bought this lens on an incredible sale. Including the adapter, which you have to purchase seperately, I spent right around $50.00. Many of my friends have larger, fancier, Nikons (the D-80's etc.) and are spending $600.00 or more on fisheye lenses. None of us are professional photographers. For what we do, my Cool Pix 5000 and this $50 lens take shots comperable to theirs. The bennefit of mine is it is much more compact. The lens does add quite a bit of wieght to the camera, but it is still much smaller and lighter than than a regular digital SLR. Very easy to use and assemble. Comes with a protective sack, though I think a sturdy carry case would have been nicer, still for $50.00 I'm not complaining."
2,It is good wide lens but not enough,"I bought it because I read that it did not gave any distortion when you photographed straight skyline.It is not true, you always get the horizon curved and that is a real pain.Same when you want to photograph a high rise building, you will get a curved line.Please do not buy if you are very serious about it.ALso I tried to return it and I could not get any answers from Amazon. Beware."
2,Be sure to keep your sales receipt!,"My experience of this disk may or may not be typical, but I found track 3 (out of 3 tracks total) unplayable. The physical disk showed scarring which matched the segment of the disk where track 3 would be, so I computer-copied the disk, hoping that the problem was surface quality and that my computer could read and copy the disk, which it did. Unfortunately, even the copy will not play track 3. The disk was brand-new and had not been handled (by me). I'm personally not too bothered, because it was track 1 that I really wanted (""Mysterium"" -- the longest piece on the disk), which is magnificent, well performed, well recorded, and playable without flaw. But I warn potential buyers to keep their receipt if track 3 is one they want to play."
2,Screamin' Jay did much better than this.,"Largely same material as ""Portrait Of A Maniac"". Compilation of Hawkins late 70's studio material. The lows far outnumber the highs, although there's a couple of good ""typical"" Hawkins numbers, with screams, snorts and snuffles. Bad disco, lukewarm blues, mostly forgettable numbers. so bad it's good cover of ""Itty Bitty Pretty One"", a very ominous cover of ""Portrait Of A Man"", even an attempt at gospel on ""What's Going To Happen On The 8th Day?""Hawkins did MUCH better material than this. Pick up the Rhino Compilation, THEN ""Best Of The Bizzare Sessions"", drop this one to the bottom of your priority list.NOT RECCOMENDED."
2,Tui Shou,"Nice book to have, but classic example of how a book really cannot teach you these techniques.Unlike mostkarate styles, in tai chi many years are spent in the form only and only after very solid mastery of the form do you reach the contact stage and even when you do one usually spends a few years with tui shou only (you do not move your feet)As with any martial art it cannot be learned through a book, but books can give some good ideas once you have considerable experience. In this case , because of the art it deals with, you really should have many years under your belt before you can get much out of this one."
5,One of Natalie's best albums,"The title song says it all--Natalie, it's good to have you back! All of the songs on this album are catchy and well produced. Natalie is at the top of her form. ""Someone's Rockin' My Dreamboat"" is my favorite, along with ""I Do"" and ""Rest of the Night"". A must have for any Natalie Cole fan!"
2,Tries too hard to sound like Everlasting.,"This album wants to sound like her previous hit Everlasting. But it tries too hard at most times. Some ballads want to sound like I Live For Your Love too much, especially Miss You Like Crazy. But there are some songs like I Do with Freddie Jackson that succeed. I heard both albums and surprisingly, Good To Be Back copies Everlasting's hit making formula way too much. Starting All Over Again is like that too. Natalie should have given this album its own identity and that's why it didn't perform as well as her previous one."
2,NOT SUITABLE FOR MOST SMALL ANIMALS,"I purchased this ""cage"" , hoping it would be a small, conveneient way for me to transport my hamsters from their regular cage, to the vet, and so on...this thing is tiny, and is def not suitable for animals such as hamsters, gerbils, rats, or mice. Bugs and hermit crabs would be okay, but thats about it. I do not reccomend this be used as advertised. Other than that, is of acceptable quality."
1,Disappointed,"When i unpacked the box and got ready to wrap it for christmas, found it was busted up... the lid was cracked (cheap thin plastic) and even the container itself was busted all up."
1,Great box but it came without the lid,"I wound up buying this at a store because the seller through Amazon sent it twice without the lid! The one I got is great. Its nice and snug. I paid about $4.50 for it in the store. I found it near the fish rather than the hamster/mice cages. I am using this for a toy, so I dont know how well it works with live animals. I would say that mice and dwarf hamsters and small snakes or lizards would fit nicely in here for a trip somewhere. it would work for insects otherwise. It seems pretty sturdy. The lid is a very snug fit and you need to put the handle down the right way to get it open. That is good since the animal couldn't easily knock it open. The handle also feels pretty sturdy as well."
2,Product description is misleading.,"While this product is suitable for quarantining small animals or transporting them to veterinary care, this is not nor ever could be a permanent housing choice for ANY fish specimen. Given its size it cannot be heated safely so tropical fish would not fair well for long.What I have used this product for was to provide temporary safe harbor inside my reef tank for a recently purchased cinnamon clownfish so that my existing clown didn't immediately tear him limb from limb and the two could familiarize themselves without injury.This product is certainly useful in some aspects, but certainly not as it's advertised -- as a permanent fixture/home for a live animal or fish."
5,MAS CANCIONES,"THIS IS A WONDERFUL CD, I ALSO HAVE HER FIRST CD CALLED CANCIONES DE MI PADRE, BOTH ARE GREAT. SONGS . I AM A MARIACHI FAN. IAM ALSO MEXICAN AND LINDA SINGS GREAT IN SPANISH. I TOTALLY DISAGREE WITH ANYONE THAT SAYS ANY DIFFRENT. WE HAVE ALOT OF SPANISH (MEXICAN ) SINGERS. THAT CALL THEMSELF SINGERS AND DONT EVEN COME CLOSE TO THEY WAY LINDA SINGS. I HAVE PLAYED THIS CD AT PARTYS AND MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY WANT TO KNOW WHO SHE IS, THEY LOVE HER SINGING AND THEY LOVE THE SONGS THAT WERE SELECTED."
4,Mas Canciones brings back memories,This album is a collection of great Mexican folk music that brings back so many great memories of generations past.
2,Bland!,"I really expected more from this artist given her past successes, but this CD was too too ""romanticos"". It was a little on the dull side."
2,Mas Canciones = More Mediocrity,"I applaud Linda's choice to make a difficult cross-over and bring mainstream attention to the genre. However, now that her marketing dollars got your attention, you have the opportunity to buy a better product. Linda is a fine singer, but if we compare her to others who spent their entire careers in this genre then she falls short. Her voice is monotonous...she only has one color and one technique (open with lots of vibrato) & her phrasing is quite poor (in Spanish). Do yourself a favor and buy Lola Beltran, Amalia Mendoza or Hermanas Padilla instead. Further, she cannot even claim to be the best Chicana in the genre...that honor would belong to Alicia Juarez the last wife of Jose Alfredo Jimenez."
4,Good,"Books on composing music for film abound these days. We read so much about the art of composing for film and television, we forget that it's a job, same as any other. This book has some nice info on cover letters and the contracts seem sound. Some of the marketing material is schmaltzy, and the book is fairly expensive for its content. (Many pages are full-page ads.) But I give it four stars for having examples of contracts and some good suggestions on introducing yourself to directors. One important thing I've learned from this book is that the same job skills go into looking for work as a composer as any other job. This book gives you the nuts and bolts."
1,Picture shown is not the item,"The picture shown here is the handlifter assembly. Part No. 63014-01 is not the handlifter - it's only a couple of extra parts. The picture should depict the parts, not the actual lifter."
4,very good,"I am very happy with this product. I wish it would have come with better directions, however was able to unload them from the internet."
1,A Not So Great collection of early teen idol performances,"If you are expecting a vintage collection of original 50s and 60s teen idol performances as I was, then avoid this DVD. Most of the content is poorly shot in the late 80s at a live club performance featuring a collection of aging 'idols' singing well past their primes. A few vintage clips from the early rock movie 'Rock Rock Rock', the best featuring Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, provides some redemption, as does a longer early retrospective of Paul Anka. For those who enjoy listening to inferior performances by once great recording stars, this collection is for you. Avoid disappointment and seek out other collections containing the vintage material we all love."
3,rock & rolls teen idols,I have mixed feelings about this dvd the live concert was good but there was some black & white taped songs I think from one of the rock & roll movies of the late 50's. The songs were mixed some hits some not with artists singing other artists songs. If your looking for the teens greatest hits you won't find alot of them here. you might be disappointed as I was.
1,DISAPPOINTED,"DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE THINKING, BUT THIS IS A MESS QUALITY AND SOUND, NOT GOOD. SOME PERFORMANCES NOT COMPLETE AND THE END OF THE DVD IS A MESS OF ....WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT.WASTE IF MONEY, NOT SATISFIED!!"
2,You Can't Go Back...,"Watching this dvd simply made me sad. It's soooo true that, ""You Can't Go Back"". One ""star"" even came out on stage with his cane. You're best playing this dvd with your eyes closed."
1,Wonder why my hat is too loose....,"....My brain must be shrinking! Never have I been so violated by a product. This is a tiny roll, maybe a foot long, of ordinary foam tape. You can buy a HUGE roll in the dollar store. It is not a specialty item made just for hats. Some genius repackaged this stuff and is making big bucks...And I thought that I was a savvy shopper; must be getting old.HAT ADJUSTER TAPE ROLL - REDUCE THE SIZE OF YOUR HATLuxury Divas are high-priced crooks, right down to their blown-up shipping fees!Oh, why the 1-star? They did ship this junk quickly!"
1,yes i know this is bad,What a load of garbage. STOP listen to this gore metal trash. Its ruining true heavy metal.
4,ultraviolent gory grinding death metal,"Exhumed are a great band because they take that unholy distortion and violence that typically you associate with grindcore but they don't fall prey to the short monotonous songs that grindcore bands sometimes turn out. Instead they rely on more musically sound death metal songs (since death metal in general places a much stronger emphasis on solid songwriting compared to the simple but direct violence of grind). So what we have here is music that contains that immediate and highly aggressive feel of grind but the songs are varied, interesting and don't all sound the same. Plus everything is about gore and thats always worth a mention. It's decently long too with thirteen songs and some great coverart. Fans of death and grind will like this"
1,"Orphan Train Quartet, Caught in the Act",I was charged for a hard cover copy of over $22. and was sent a paper back valued of about $2.35.and could not find a way to noteify the sender . And if they have gotten any of my attemps I ha ve not received anyreplys. Needless to say Im very disappointed in the service of this sender.Diana Strub
3,Shakespeare without poetry,"Given the two leads, I had high hopes for this production, especially since its only two competitors--the Welles and the Polanski versions--butcher the text mercilessly; while another with Piper Laurie as Lady Macbeth has been universally panned by critics. Sorry to report that this low-budget, studio bound production (no harm in that per se) is a prosaic reading of the text with not a single Big Moment, as they say in theater. We can easily blame the director, but the Macduff was allowed now and then to raise his voice and pose a bit. Jayston's Macbeth was so low key that one had the feeling this was a dress rehearsal and the fire would come on opening night. We still need a good version of this play on video (the BBC version is nearly awful). Until then, this version can help some student who has a test the next day bone up on the plot."
5,These are very good... I love this product,I made a french onion soup and added these to it for protein. It tastes great! Wooo...I'm especially glad these are high in protein.
3,No Directions for Cooking Included,"I just received my order for French Lentils from Barry Farms. There were no directions for cooking the lentils. Now, I am doing additional research so that I know how to use them. Not something I am excited about!"
2,Plantronics Headset for S10,I will give this headset a poor rating only because its performance without the amplifier is extremely poor. Otherwise a very good product.
2,Fragile,"This is the second time the wire caught in my chair and pulled out of the plug, there is no way for me to repair it as it is smaller than the regular phone jack plug."
2,People can't hear you,"I purchased this for use with a ShoreTel IP 230 phone. I could hear other people just fine, but everybody kept saying they could barely hear me (unless I almost yelled or held the mic against my mouth, which defeats the purpose of a ""hands free"" headset). It was comfortable to wear and seemed to be built with quality materials, but it did not work for me. Maybe it needs a phone with an amplifier? I'm going to try another brand of headset and see if I have the same problem."
2,does the job poorly,"Headset is cool and works, but outbound volume is poor. The headset is nice looking and works but I have to work with it, which is a pain. Mic is too far from my mouth."
3,headset,Well I thought I was getting complete Plantronics T10 headset but I was wrong so I am having a lil bit of problems but I guess it was my fault for not knowing the produsct. They work okat though.
4,Comfortable and clear,"I work for a call center from my home. I have the Plantronics T-10 phone that I use for 10 hour shifts. I ordered this headset as a replacement for my phone after my cat yanked the first cord out of the phone, but left the plug in the phone. Dangling wires, NOT good. The headset is comfortable for long periods, no one seems to have any problem hearing me and overall it's held up well. I would recommend this headset, although I wish the cord were a little sturdier."
1,Headset review,This product is not expensive and the sound quality reflects the cost. It was very difficult to hear or be heard with this product. It might work well with an amplifyer or something.
3,Could be Louder on Polycom,"I got a couple of these for staff members who use a Polycom SoundPoint IP 550 HD VOIP phones and while you can hear perfectly, you will sound a LOT quieter to the person you are talking to. We tried all settings on the phone and they all were basically the same. I guess with an external amplifier it may work better."
1,Not worth the money,"Was excited to get this product, as a few of my co-workers have this brand name, but sadly found out no one could hear me. Back to the handset."
2,Did not work on Avaya phone 1610,This headset although is at a great price - did not work with the Avaya 1610. I think it might work with a Cisco phone or a home office phone.
1,PODEY,I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS ITEM BECAUSE IT DID NOT WORK. I WOULD LIKE MY MONEY BACK FOR THIS ITEM ASAP? THE SELLER WAS GOOD BUT THE PRODUCT WAS BAD.
5,very nice,this hat is nice but not for people with hair. it a small hat my husband has long dreads and this hat just sat on top of his head so if you are just starting to grow your dreads it will be fine.
5,I'm Addicted,"My husband and I eat popcorn most nights. Popcorn was on the core food list at Weight Watchers. We'd rent a movie and have one flavor at a time with 2 tsp of olive oil, and non-stick spray to make the seasoning stick. They make popcorn so much better. We went from microwave, to original method in a pot, to a machine, to an air-popper. Each time we used one of the flavors. I love them."
5,Great debut!!,"For those of you who gave this a bad rating...you obviously are Pantera fans and not Mudvayne fans. Just because Vinnie is on drums doesn't make this band Pantera. For the rest of you that may or may not be Mudvayne fans, you won't be disappointed. Pick it up..check it out...and enjoy!"
5,HELLYEAH HELL F-ING YEAH,THIS IS A GREAT CD FOR WHO ANYBODY THAT LOVES METAL THIS A GREAT NEW BAND NOT ONE BAD SONG ON ENTIRE ALBUM CANT WAIT TO SEE THEM LIVE IN PERSON
2,HELLNO!!!!!!,what the hell mudvayne i thought that u guys were'nt going to split i guest wrong why HELLYEAH
2,Lacking!,"I have to say that I'm pretty disappointed with this release. I was hoping Vinnie Paul would come back with a vengeance after the terrible death of his brother in arms Dime. The fact that he was there for the shooting, must have been tough. I would imagine that something like that would be hard to recover from.Overall this cd just lacks good tunes and that's really all you can say about it. The mix is ok and the vocals are alright. But again, if the songs were really good, the entire experience probably would have been better.I'm glad Vinnie's back, but he can do better. Maybe he should call up James in Metallica and get Lars booted out. Can you imagine Vinnie in Metallica? maybe he could save that band and help bring it back to it's former glory!Overall I found this to be a pretty boring listen. I was hoping for so much more and this release unfortunately does not deliver the goods!"
2,eh i can take it or leave it,it sounds like watered down mudvayne. just go buy albums by the bands this superground consists of. you'll get less disapointing results...
2,This album sucks....straight up,"If you think this album is any good at all, you are seriously trying too hard to like it. The first 3 songs are the only thing they have going for them and they get old fast. Not what was expected from them. You want to hear a good album, buy Doomsday Machine by Arch Enemy, they are at the top of the game right now and are only getting better."
5,HELLYEAH,"If I heard this CD without knowing who it was, I would say it sounds like a cross between Mudvayne and Pantera. I disagree with people who think its different from either band as both the Mudvayne and Pantera styles are obvious. I have yet to listen to nothing face so I won't make reference to their style.The CD is mostly fast paced with a couple slower songs. Even the slower songs are good but have a different mood than the rest of the CD. The band is appropriately named because the song HELLYEAH is by far one of the best songs made.Don't buy this CD if you're expecting Pantera or Mudvayne. Buy this CD if you can appreciate both styles blended perfectly into 11 songs (not counting in the mood)."
4,Skull Crushing Entertainment,"This album delivers a supersonic punch right into the skull of the listener. In a world where many bands must try real hard to define a unique sound, these guys (all from various influential metal backgrounds) deliver an authentic metal recording that sounds better with every listen. So, take a shot of Jack, chase it down with a cold brew, and turn the volume knob to the max and be prepared to have your face kicked in. Hellyeah stands and delivers! I cannot wait to see them live at the Family Values Tour this summer."
4,Better than I thought it would be,"Let me start by saying I am not a fan of Pantera or Mudvayne so here you get a byass opinion of this album.if you are a fan of either band you may not like it as its not as hard driven as either.if you are a fan of metal and am tired of all this nu metal wanna be stuff than get this and give it a try.I am fan of COC,Zakk Wylde and Brand New Sin..Hellyeah is not as good as any of them but I would put it up there and above most other nu junk."
2,piec of trash,this cd sucks. it is worth about 1 dollar. if you can download do it... dont waste your money on this garbage. if you want a real cd buy the new DARK TRANQUILLITY in about a week. this cd sounds like boring metal riffs that have been done before....
1,HERE'S WHAT THIS REVIEWER IS THINKING...HILARIOUS.,"The name of the band says it all. Is this hillbilly metal or redneck nu-metal? I hope they name the second album COWBOY HATS AND JACK DANIELS or BUCKAROOS IN HELL. The riffs are dull, the vocals bland, and the song writing is uninspired.I was never a fan of Mudvayne. Maybe this why. And Vinnie, what the hell were you thinking? You can't be serious. I guess rednecks need some headbanging anthems too.YUCK!!I need to listen to the new Machine Head album to wash this bad taste of stinky Southern wrangler nu-metal, or whatever it is, out of my mouth.Or, if you need something with a cowpoke in the title get Pantera's COWBOYS FROM HELL."
5,Hellyeah,"I've read a lot of reviews on this band both on here and on other web sites. For the most part they all seem negative. These reviews were in part why I simply stayed clear from this band. Recently I had the chance to hear for myself. Here is what I think.It's a mix of Mudvayne and Pantera. More Mudvayne then Pantera, but still a nice mix. That being said if you like both bands I don't see any reason not to like this band. I really love Mudvayne's vocals and Vinnie Paul is one of my favorite drummers so needless to say I really enjoy this band.Lyrics are not anything special, however that doesn't concern me. I'm not interested in meaningful lyrics I just want something enjoyable to listen to.As far as the guitar work is concerned, it's no dimebag. Then again, is anything other then Pantera?To sum this up I will just say this. I really like this band. Buy it."
4,well sure!,"Vinnie Paul and the band delivers solid music and their own style on this set. Real solid. Great mix of styles. Hard southern, metal, alt metal? Its all good."
4,Stopping listening to the critics - just buy it!,"Excellent CD! So glad I finally bought it. Don't buy it expecting Pantera, Mudvayne, or anything else. Just expect a kick-your-butt CD that is great metal, with pretty good vocals and a punching bass/drums. Possibly considered more of an old-school (90's) sound, but if you're a fan of it then this is a CD for you.The only complaint I have is that no-where in the product description on Amazon did it state that the CD would come in a little cardboard sleeve, as opposed to a plastic CD case with a booklet, lyrics, etc. That really ticked me off at first, but the music made up for it."
2,Barron's needs an editor...,"I am appalled by the errors in this book - and I have only studied the Math and Science sections so far. Some of the answers are glaringly wrong. Some of the statements are completely inconsistent with each other or with the quiz answers. That said, on the bright side, researching the science inconsistencies has taught me a lot. The breadth of the subject matter is actually helpful and there were some beneficial explanations in this book that I did not find in others - but don't always trust the answers given and do research the inconsistencies."
2,who did your editing?!?,"I concur. I was pretty disappointed with this study guide. I sent the Barron's editing team a list of errors and typos that I found over the course of my studying. Wow--certainly not something I would have expected from a reputable name like Barron's. I will say that I rather liked the way they broke down the information in to bite sized pieces and I also liked their tips and timelines on how to study...but it did not make up for the seriously careless editing of this text. A quick proof read could have caught some, if not all of the stuff."
1,ZERO STARS FOR A ZERO BOOK,"Forget the 24 hour analog clock example (which is correct, 6:30 PM would be 18:30 military time, no?) there are so many other typos to contend with that I am half-crazed at this point, and I can only assume that this careless lack of proofreading carries over into every section. The math alone has errors on EVERY SINGLE PAGE! Give me a break. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS BOOK. The extra time you spend proofreading the text to determine who is correct, the book or yourself, could be better spent learning from another text."
1,Don't buy this test prep.,"This book is rife with inaccuracies, typos, answer numbers that don't match up to question numbers... The number of mistakes makes you question the accuracy of the rest of the information. If you are looking for a test prep book it might serve you better to find one that includes the right answers."
1,Got this book pulled from my campus bookstore....,"As everyone else has said, this book is beyond a simple editing error. I'll give my favorite example - Draw a picture of an analog clock representation of the time 6:30 - simple enough....The book's ""solution"" is a drawing of a clock showing 9:30. I don't think bad editing can even describe the inaccuracies in the book. The thing was supposedly written a Dr. I called Barron's on it, got the book pulled from my university book store, and reported it to my school's credentialing department so that they could pass the word on within the College of Ed."
1,Terribly unhelpful,Luckily I only checked this out from the library. It's almost as if they didn't know the test content at all. Plus there were several glaring mistakes. I recommend everyone stay away from this. Cliff's 2nd Edition was the best CSET Multiple Subject guide I found.
1,Worst Exam Review Ever,"The book is not only filled with silly typos, but blatantly incorrect information. For the Subtest 1 review, names of historically significant individuals are wrong and grammar in the grammar section is incorrect. At the most basic level of review via the sample CSET exams, Barrons screws this one up as well with countless typos citing wrong answers. Had I not been using another study guide in conjunction with this text, I probably would not have caught many important errors. Like another reviewer noted, on the bright side, you can learn a lot by double checking and researching all the misinformation in the book. What a waste of money..."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK,This is one of the worst books I have ever used. It is filled with typos and substantive mistakes. It would be a miracle if anyone using this book actually passed the CSET.
1,Pure garbage!!!,Severals errors in this book particularly in the math and science sections. I haven't looked at the history and language arts sections but assume that they are bad as well based on what everyone else has reported. I am just glad that my background is in science and could identify the errors. Just don't buy this book there are plenty of others to choose from.I now have to go out and buy a new prep book. At least I have something to throw in the fireplace to get it going come winter time!!!
4,Effective Preparation Manual,I've worked through most of this book and I found it to be an effective preparation manual for the CSET. It gives many study options for the test and it shows how most people can prepare in a reasonable amount of time. The book contains annoying places that show the book was not properly edited. But this book is meeting my needs for good CSET test preparation.
4,I love this CD,"I feel that this group is fresh and new from whats going on right now. It has a hiphop feel with a strong message of Gods faithfulness to us. On the days your feeling down this CD will lift you up and let's you know to hang on in there. I look forward to the next album Khesha Becton and New Day brings out! My favorite songs are ""he's the one"","" Rhapsody in praise"", and ""New Day""."
5,I would like to say,"The album is great and I listen to it every time I get a chance. Khesha can sing and she is super fine and that is hard to find in the gospel industry today not that it matters but it sure helps. All the save brothers in New Haven thinks Khesha is representing ""SHOW NUFF"" The video is great hope to see more soon and a tour of khesha in our town soon"
5,"""And the Grammy goes to""","Khesha Becton and New Day is breath of fresh air. With a new exciting sound with the never ending message that Jesus saves. The sound is so urban yet its like a church worship service. Khesha voice is awsome and full of Holy Ghost power. I've just taught my church choir ""Rhapsody in Praise"" and they all love it.Detroit MI can not wait until Khesha Becton is here live. I'm so taken with this project. I first purchased the album because I also like Willam Becton's music and thought that Khesha would carry the same music flavor that he has, but to my suprise, Khesha has brought with her a whole new flavor that is a begining of a new trend in Gospel music. If you don't have the album you should get it, and if you have it buy a copy for someone eles. God Bless you Khesha and Keep on working for the Master. I can not wait until the next album. How can I get on the Fan club List?"
5,Praise and Worship,Khesha Becton and New Day is a wonderful album. I enjoy it very much. When I get into my car every morning to go to work It's the first CD I listen to. It is very uplifting and powerful. Khesha voice is amazing she has her on style but she still puts you in mind of Kim Burell and Kelly Price. The message is strong and the praise and worship is outstanding.
5,Encyclopedia of the Cat,"I only glanced through this, as it was a gift for someone else, but it is by the same person who wrote the Encyclopedia of the Dog, which I own and love. Even though I am not an animal owner, the pictures and descriptions of the breeds, as well as the historical data, is great fun. This is terrific to have around the house, and a good gift for the animal lover."
2,Sounds nothing like KMFDM,"Tribute albums have earned a generally warranted bad reputation, and this one, while slightly better than the average, still pretty much blows. A lot of the songs sound nothing like KMFDM, so they aren't really remixes or covers. They're different songs with KMFDM lyrics in them. This would be an album I would only recommend for someone who wants everything with the letters KMFDM on it.Plus side: ""Disobedience"" - Raymond Watts turns that song into a jazzy lounge song like ""Angel"" from Praise The Lard.Die Krupps' remix/cover of ""Power"" is cool.The cover of ""A Drug Against War"" by Razed In Black is pretty good.The horror, the horror: The disgusting remix of ""Juke Joint Jezebel."" It's an atrocity!""Sex On A Flag"" by Interfaith vs. Rick Sitter...I think you ""blew your cover"" if you can't even get the title right."
4,"For a tribute album, it rocks.","Two of the tracks are done by fromer members of the band (being the first two tracks actually). And I must say it is one of the best tribute albums that exist out there. If you can find it cheap, BUY IT! IT IS WORTH IT!"
2,Duck and cover!,"Help! It's another bad tribute album from the the people who brought you such stinkers as ""The Passion Of Covers: A Tribute To Bauhaus"" and other worthless titles full of terrible bands (Rosetta Stone) doing terrible covers, and even some good bands (Sheep On Drugs, Julian Beeston) doing surprisingly terrible covers. Now why did I give such an insulting CD 2 whole stars? Well for one thing, Sheep On Drugs' ""Money"", while lacking all of what I was expecting them to give the song is pretty cool (if you don't think of the original while listening to it), and, the new remix of ""Light"" by Gunther Shultz (ex-KMFDM guitarist) is a treat that extends from the songs single, and ""Disobedience"" is more of a loungy remake of the original than a cover (Mr. Watts did sing the original as well). So if you like the bands on this CD, get it, but only if you know the originals very well. And if you don't but you are a completest (like me :( ) go for it. But just remember this ""YOU WERE WARNED""."
3,Repairing DVD Scratches,"Nothing really in my experience will truly repair DVD movie scratches, particularly on NetFlix or Blockbuster DVDs. However, this product may let you get past a single bad point that is causing the movie to freeze. It works as well as any we have tried."
1,Poor Sound Quality,This recording was made in 1968 (AAD Stereo on the CD). Sounds like it was recorded in a 40 gallon drum. The performance is good but the recording technology lets it down severely.
5,change the way you teach,"This book truly helped me to understand the Habits of Mind. It was a new concept in my graduate class, and I feel much more up to date now."
5,A faded actor has a series of hilarious misadventures.,"This is a FANTASTIC read. Film critic Roger Ebert is also a gifted weaver of the absurd and what-happens-next serial. Not only is the book hilariously improbable, Ebert also uses his passion for London and the eccentrics that populate it to great effect. The result is compelling, surprising, and always riotous. This book shows a side of Roger Ebert that readers of his reviews and fans of his popular TV show may not be familiar with. Do yourself a favor - buy this reasonably priced book, enjoy it, and tell your friends. It's a real treat!"
5,best live recording by this band,"This cd is definitely superior to Once In A Livetime by a longshot. The sound quality is much better and this show was performed very close to perfection. They do a lot of stuff on this show that wasn't done on the rest of this tour, like the choir on ""The Spirit Carries On"", and of course the live narrator on those parts from Scenes From A Memory. Also, very well-played complete live versions of ""A Mind Beside Itself"" and ""A Change Of Seasons"". It's 3 cds long and it's all the same show, which is one of the things I look for in live cds. If you have to choose between this and OIAL, I recommend this one. If you're a Dream Theater fan, you definitely won't be disappointed. If you don't know much about Dream Theater, get their studio stuff first."
4,really cool,"i love Dream Theater, and this is a really good CD. What I hate about it is how much LaBrie uses that high-pitch voice that takes away much of the beauty of Metropolis Pt. 1 and some other songs."
2,Boring!,"The first part of this triple live CD set, Scenes From A Memory, is great (except for the backing vocals of Mike Portannoying). But after that the rest of the live performances are boring and terrible!Jordan Rudess is an amazing talent. However, he sounds awful performing songs from Awake, Images and Words AND Falling Into Infinity! His solo spot is equally atrocious.James Labrie is a studio singer. He just can not pull his own live, unlike Geoff Tate or other more talented singers.John Petrucci sounds tasteful and intune as usual.Mike Portnoy overplays and should not be allowed to have a microphone.Finally, the band's bass playing session puppet, John Myung, keeps on keeping on.Save your money and buy the studio albums instead!"
3,"Talented, yes, but the vocalist, er, um, well","Dream Theater is an extreamly talented band, but the vocalist sounds too whiney. Other than that, you get your moneys worth."
3,"Great music, LaBrie sucks though","The musicians are good and James Labrie is great on studio tracks....But live he is just TERRIBLE, and it's true for all the Dream Theater live albums. (just listen to Once in a Livetime - Caught In A Web, the worst offender ever). Get this live take for the music because it's a great buy for that, but don't expect good singing though....it's really painful to listen to him."
3,Instruments Great...But..JLaBrie's vocals pleaaaseeee!!!,"Unlike a lot of people, when Images & Words came out I thought that James La Brie's vocals were perfect, and the band was perfection in a 100%. Next album, Awake, the same thing and so on...until Once In A Livetime. The live performance of all DT members was awesome on that recording, with the only exception of JLB, he seems so tired and he screams with a completely out-of-control voice sometimes. Well, i'm a big DT fan and thought ""OK, the guy was probably running or jumping or whatever"" (though i have the video)A couple of years later this album came out... And JLB's voice it's even worse than the other live recordings. And i mean, WORSE i can't stand it. really, i love DT, but JLB live performance it's so un-satisfactory."
5,Fun book,My 4 month old loves this book. The bright pictures and rhyming prose make this a hit with him. Love it.
2,Not Practical,"The colors, style, and theme of this book are excellent. It is one of the few I found that is simple enough for toddlers just beginning to identify shapes. However, I found it to have a huge flaw. The shapes inside the book are ""puzzle pieces"". For example, there is a picture of a baseball, and underneath the baseball is the word circle. Except instead of lifting a flap, each of the cardboard shapes actually comes out of the book. They don't reinsert easily. I can just imagine after one or two readings that the pieces would be everywhere but in the book."
5,Amazing Book,"My 2 year old loves this book (he loves all Baby Einstein stuff - videos, books etc.) more than any other book/toy he ever played with. He learnt all the shapes in this book within a few days and recognizes these shapes anywhere he sees them, but it remains his favorite book even after many weeks."
2,Buyer beware,"Initially, I thought this was a great product. It kept our son entertained with educational games through two long hot summer afternoons. However, the game is designed so that when you pass level two, it directs you to their website and informs you that if you want to continue, [...] Unfortunately, my son was already excited about earning the ""badges"" and was upset that he can't earn all of them without a subscription. NO WHERE on the box is this explained to the consumer. On their website, other parents have complained; yet, the company feebly replies that it is sorry if subscription requirements are not made clear. Still, it appears as if it has made NO effort to change their packaging. Considering the initial price combined with a yearly membership is close to $100, I would not have bought this if I would have known my son was going to end up disappointed, and I would end up bamboozled."
2,Product is misleading,"We recently purchased this program & my 5 year old was immediately engaged and excited. Once she got to level 2 out of about 12 it tells her to ""get her parent to log on to jumpstart.com and buy a membership"". I'm not interested in a $75 annual membership and clearly feel that she can't get the full benefit of the program I purchased. It would be nice to be able to access the remaining 10 levels without shelling out more $$. We've gone online to use their ""free"" games to see if this allows her to pass to the next level but that doesn't work either."
1,Jumpstart is EVIL!!!,"We've been fans of the jumpstart games for years now as our kids have enjoyed the ""edutainment"" experience. However, this latest jumpstart ""business model"" is EVIL!As others have stated, they only give you the first two levels when you purchase this product for [...]. After that, you are required to purchase an online membership to unlock the other levels.No where is this limitation or ""requirement"" specified on the box. [...][...]"
1,Too many script errors,"Also frustrating for kids. Claims to use some kind of adaptive process to alter difficulty of the game, but this just results in a long list of repetitions of the same game before you get anywhere. Very frustrating for little kids."
2,Requires internet connection,"We were very dissatisfied with this product. It is a form of Jumpstart World, and VERY different from the other kindergarten products.My child liked the games inside the ""arcades"", but walking around the ""world"" was not interesting to her, and they kept commanding her to do things she wanted to do later.Also, it requires an internet connection to start up even though you supposedly are not playing over the internet. Very suspicious in this world of predators. I do not let my children connect online at all, so this game only gets played when I am in the room also."
4,A little deceptive,"My five year old was first introduced to Jumpstart by a Chic-Fil-A kids meal prize. He loved that game so much that we asked my mom to get this one for his birthday. He loves the game and wants to play it all the time. My one problem with it is that he cannot play the entire game unless we buy a membership to the jumpstart website. While it looks like there are many many games, you can't play them without the membership. I still can't find anywhere on the box where it states that this will happen. I feel a little deceived."
4,My Daughter love it!,"My daughter loves this package of games. She especially loves the arts and crafts because it allows her to print things out and make them herslef. Yes, the games do tend to repeat as one review stated, but that is how kids learn. I think this game package is well worth the money."
2,19 bux to be an involuntary captive to internet connectivity,4-5 DVDS in this pack...the keypad exercise DVD was good but 2 of the main DVDs needed an internet connection to the manufacturer's website to access...which I thought was not cool... and even then something didnt allow me to have continuos access to the software.. a window kept popping up for me to choose a file in the DVD..and those files that I clicked on lasted 1 min or so..then the program would stop..repeat..
1,Do not buy this!,"My daughter received this as a gift for Christmas. When we tried to install we discovered that is only works on outdated, obsolete operating systems."
2,How Do You Play These Games?!?!?!?!?!,My 5 year old daughter is out there crying right now because this stupid game which doesn't come with ANY instructions just made her little doggie disappear and we can't find it and there are no directions! There are only two games to play on the pet playground game and they are lame. I feel like I wasted my money. And we still can't find that stupid dog. It's like torture for your kindergartener!!!
4,Good Clean Christian song,"This is really a great piece for someone who is searching for peace and craving for something which uplifts his soul. soothing music mix which is handled exceptionally well. I recommend this to anyone , even to those who has got an aversion to Christian Gospel.Give your life a chance. Give some of your time to God."
5,A perfect travel companion!,This book was the most helpful of all the Napa travel guides I have purchased.
3,"Good quality pick, low quality necklace","Absolutely loved the thing the first day I got it at Christmas. The necklace for it broke the first day of Christmas. I was kind of disappointed, but I bought a extra chain to go along with it though and it worked perfectly until the chain broke and I lost the pick. I would recommend buying this only if you plan to buy a good chain to keep it on."
5,Great present,"My daughter chose her own Christmas present this year, and this is what she chose! She loves playing guitar and she loves Jesus, so this was the perfect gift. We ordered it and it arrived in just a few days. Since it was December, we were pleasantly surprised at the prompt service.She was delighted when the pick necklace arrived. Naturally, we let her have it early so she could wear it to all the youth Christmas functions at church.I would definitely recommend this as an excellent gift for any guitar player, especially if they are teens."
1,Do not buy - Misleading subscription service required.,Warning - A subscription service for $8/month is required for 70% of the game. Do not buy unless you want to pay more monthly or have a crying child who wonders why they cannot continue playing the game.See the message board on Jumstart's website for experiences from upset parents.
1,Do Not Buy!!! It's a RIP OFF!!,"We bought this for our 3 year son who is pretty advance for his age. After about a couple of hours of playing it he had already passed the first two stages and complained he couldn't do anymore. When I checked into it, I found out we had to pay a monthly membership online to play the rest of the games!!! What is the point of buying a game when we can't play the entire thing!! Do NOT buy this!! It is a rip off. We just paid $20 for a sample game!! You can bet we are going to get our money back. Anyone who has bought this should do the same. This was a great disappointment."
2,Waste of Money,"This product makes me so mad. My son and I completed the game within a few days. It shows other places that you can visit, HOWEVER, you can not play in those areas without going online and buying an extremely overpriced membership. I will never buy JumpStart products again."
1,"Not for ages stated, boring as well","This says it's for age 1 1/2 but it's way to advanced for a child so young. My son will be 2 in 3 months he has no interest in this game at all. He really loves to move the mouse by himself and I wanted a game we could do together with him playing it under my supervision. My son is interested in the games daddy plays like World of Warcraft which he laughs at all the time and enjoys the graphics of daddy jumping on his wolf, but he won't even look at the screen with this Jumpstart game playing.I expected it to be more visually stimulating for children so young but the graphics are horrid and boring.The learning is for older kids who are 3 or older.Not much content either for a $20 game, should be $10 at most.The game was rather girly with little ducks and butterflys everywhere."
1,Monthly fees,Beware - if your child wants to play all of the games available you have to pay a monthly fee for a membership. Buying this software only gives you access to a limited number of games. My daughter loves to play the ones available but I don't think its worth it to pay for the rest. You also have to have the disc in the drive to play and there are 5 discs. It is a pain to have to change discs whenever my daughter wants to change games.
3,"Decent features for our 2.5 yr old boy, but it crashes too often.","Typically unstable shovelware in the edutainment/education market. I wish this segment of the software market was better. I would be willing to pay more for a viable, useful software product. The engineering in these things always lags traditional games, and the technology (direct 3d, etc) is always many revs behind because their target market is running older PC's and OS's. Doesn't mean they can't improve their testing across the board."
1,Its a scam,"We bought it and found out its a scam... you can't do what it says. You only get letters A-G and have to go online to buy a membership to get the rest of the game. It isn't a one time fee, its a monthly membership. We called Jumpstart and complained, they were rude, nasty, and informed us that they will mail us a non-membership game version, but we have to pay the shipping. No where on the box does it tell you this... they are totally scamming."
4,My Little Boy Loves It,"My 2 1/2 year old has had the games for about 2 week now and he wants to play the ""Ducky Game"" (Toddler) all the time. I love it because I can go off and do the dishes while he plays it by himself with only a little bit of supervision. He has gotten so good at it I let him into the ""Other Game"" (Preschool) and I can't get him off. My only disappiontment is he mastered Toddler so fast he does get a bit bored with it and Preschool is somewhat to advanced for him to play completely by himself - he sure likes to try and he does not want Mommy's help even when he gets himself stuck. Which happens a lot with Preschool. Oh well... I am sure that before I know it he will master Preschool. I am going to wait for a long time before I try getting out the other 2 discs."
2,Too brief for real use,"The book is made up of a collection of editorials from FAIR, the public-interest watchdog group. The articles are short and not particularly incisive, and focus on the usual transgressions of America's corporate-owned media. As a reference source Cohen and Solomon's book is not particularly valuable: the articles are simply too brief to provide much useful depth or information. Moreover the groupings lack real coherent unity that follow through on the theme. Still and all, a revisit of Upton Sinclair's struggle against the entrenched wealth of his day (1920's & 30's) provides useful perspective on today's media struggles. And the beat goes on."
4,Very good,"Good video, great sellerI did not like and agree with the ads, I am paying for DVD, I was expecting free of ads"
4,Great,"If you're a Tom Joyner Morning Show listerner, you will be quite familiar with this one. It is an easy read since it refreshes your memory of Tavis' commentaries and those well known campaigns; like saving Living Single & New York Undercover, Texaco's boardroom racism, Christie's planned auction of slave ""memorabilia?"" and bringing hate crime cases to light. As I read it I could hear and feel the voice and emotion of the original spoken words. I really liked it and read it in just one day."
2,Very hard to understand,"To me, this was poorly written, much of the writing was incomplete or scattered. I had to look up everything online to understand it, therefore negating the need for a textbook. Very disappointed in this purchase."
5,"more like swervedriver, sort of....","as others have said, this is definitely more on the track that was deviated from when swervedriver stopped recording. what would swervedrivers sound have evolved into? i would have to guess that toshack highway, although similar in some ways, really wasn't that direction. while there are many swervedriver cues, this record sounds more like a reaction to toshack highway and the guitar work with sophia then it does to the swervedriver sound. not to say that there is more ""space-psychedelia"" than ""rock"", that would be far from acurate. it is more of a rock record, with more identifiable pop ""hooks"" and melodies then the stuff adam has been recording for the last number of years. great record from one of the more inventive, always evolving (and most uncredited) artists of the last 13 years!"
4,Shocks of Mighty,"Ex-Swervedriver honcho Adam Franklin's Bolts of Melody is a great sounding album that honestly sounds like a more mature, updated version of his former band. Great songwriting, wonderful playing and lots of atmosphere. Hendrix fans will get a kick out of ""Theme from LSD."" I saw Adam live on this tour and noticed a distinctly jazzy feel to some of the new songs. Highlights include ""Sundown"", ""Song of Solomon"" and ""Canvey Island Baby"" although I really enjoy the introspective stuff too, like album closer ""Ramonesland."" If you dig fluid, effect-heavy guitar and laconic yet melodic vocals, you're gonna dig Bolts. Neil Young fans, I'm talking to you."
4,power rangers.,"Hi,I am so glad that they are coming out on DVD for Power Rangers RPM this will be the first time that I will see it they don't play here in Melbourne Fl. I wish they did. They played on toon Disney till they whet Disney XD now they play shows that where stop a long time ago I wish they put the Power Rangers back on. But I am glad to get the DVD real soon.Candy"
4,Great for novices and experts,"This is a great text for everyone. I think Zubaly's Applied Naval Architecture does a slightly better job in presenting the coefficients, but in every other respect, this text is superior. Zubaly and this text are weak in the details of seakeeping, but there are several other specific seakeeping texts, namely Dynamics of Marine Vehicles by Battacharia (I know I misspelled his name)"
4,Introduction To Naval Architect,If you r looking for an entry point for Naval Architect this is the book to do so.A broad overview on Naval Architect topics that will highlight all its various areas of knowledge
2,Use only if you plan to build warships,"The information is through and I assune somewhat complete, if you plan to do a reconstruction of the aircraft carrier Nimitz or may older issues such as the Enterprise. However for anything under 250 feet, the book is virtually not applicable. I am currently refitting a 40' aftcabin crusier that is mahogany and oak. I was hoping to find information on newer reconstruction methods however, this book only deals in theory pertaining to large vessels and classical construction methodology."
1,get the ensemble book!!,"i'm on the net ALL the time, playing aoe. i bought this book & the one by bruce shelly. this one is PALE in comparision to the other, which truly rocks! those guys have been playing AOE/ROR/AOK for ever & so write with a passion & base all their tips on experience. for mark, this is a summer project. he is probably writing something on a playstation game right now. get it from the source. don't waste your money on some ""outsider"" giving you tips!"
5,Awesome game!,"This is an awesome game for anyone who likes constant action...You advance trough the middle ages while making the best military you can. Then with your military you attack your enemy. I suggest this game to everyone. With more than 3000 players online, I think youll like it.It is an awesome gift for anyone."
1,What a waste,You'd think this could have some original strategies or SOMETHING useful. This is like the manual with a walkthrough thrown in. Don't waste your time on this book.
2,A big disappointment,"I am a rookie at AOK, so I thought this book might help me improve. I have played the game for only a couple of weeks and almost all the tips given here were things I had already learned in the course of playing the game. This book adds very little to the knowledge base of the manual and/or that which one obtains by playing a few campaigns. I felt it was a real waste of money."
2,Only for the Most Casual of Gamers,"Definitely a ""corporate"" work. There is virtually nothing here that anyone simply jumping in blind couldn't figure out in a few hours. The ""information"" on the individual civilizations could apply to ANY of them. Very skimpy, and overpriced."
2,weak,"fortunately, this book was part of a bundle and I did not have to pay for it. If you are new to RTS games, then it might be of some use. Otherwise, what person with any brains would not know to put weaker missile units behind sturdier melee ones? I mean, really, it's that basic."
3,Skip this if you're not a rookie.,"Well if you're looking for in-depth strategies you're in the wrong place, it only works if your manual is missing or something like that, this only gives the very basics of the game and if you're a semi-experienced then you already found out for yourself most of the ""tips"" in the book.I give it 3 stars because the Mexican edition of the book (which I own) includes a CD-ROM with additional levels and AI files and many other utilities that will allow you to take more fun of the game."
2,What a joke,"I'm quite certain that ""five star"" review was written by the book's author. Anyone that's played the game online would laugh at this book. For a *real* strategy guide you should definitely get Prima's book or Sybex's book. Sybex's book had substantial input from top gamers and Prima's book was entirely written by top gamers. Who's ever heard of this author? He writes books--he doesn't play games. Good grammar dude! Now go write a dictionary and leave us gamers alone."
3,"Thorough, but maybe-dare I say- too obsessive","I bought this book because it covered all 7 seasons and was written by highly respected authors in the Buffy universe. It was very thorough. I loved the kill count and character profiles. The section I hated the most- the glitches. Maybe its my love of the show and maybe I hate anyone criticizing my favorite show of all time. But the glitches section seemed to be whiny and nit-picky. Especially since their commentary for Season 6 complained about the overuse of obsessive geeks and this book talks about little flaws in the show that are sound like someone really watched this show- again, date I say- TOO much."
3,"Nice, attractive aerator, but doesn't swivel well","Nice looking and works well.However, be aware that the lower part of the aerator must be manually screwed on tight to the upper part of the aerator, or else it will leak when the water is turned on.Unfortunately, though, when it's on tight, it doesn't swivel well."
3,Not a bad book but...,It was not a bad book.But the characters were not really well-drawn. And the heroine was so dense. The hero was so different in character and they had nothing in common. They seemed so mismatched that it was just not believable.
4,As Good as Ever!,"If you are familiar with Shannon Donnelly's compromise series, you will be familiar with A Dangerous Compromise, the second in the six book series. It was published in paperback in 2001, and it is as fresh today as when it was first released. Some have pointed out that it is darker than most Regency romances, but I think that is part of the appeal. I also think Clarissa is an appealing heroine because she is not a typical leading lady. Maybe a little foolish, but at least a little different. If you are new to the series, you will enjoy this one, and if you are an old fan, you will enjoy rereading it."
2,"Stylish,comfortable..but limited durability","These earring are very cute, maybe sophisticated too.They are simple and classic in design.The only flaw of these earrings is that the Hinge cannot take Extended wear.I began to find them on the floor,( my girlfriend did sleep with them on (that's how comfortable they are )I recommend you buy a few pairs, they're very inexpensive and especially if you like the look."
4,useful resource,"This is definitely a great resource for the aspiring mystery novelist since the book helps authors construct realistic plots for police procedurals. This is because it contains crucial information about how investigators conduct investigations. However, some of the material covered is obvious but, nonetheless, there are many interesting facts."
1,Too basic for writers,"This book is subtitled as a writer's guide, but it is hard to imagine that an experienced writer would not already possess most of the basic information contained in this book. It appears to be geared toward the novice who has had little introduction, through reading or whatever, to the crime investigation profession. There are more comprehensive books on the market."
5,Inspiring Music,"Peter Sterling's music is pleasing to the ear and soothing to the soul. I love this CD, it is absolutely breathtaking. I highly recommend this to everyone who enjoys beautiful music; I know you will love this album as much as I do."
3,Got excited.... and then got disappointed.,I bought this as sort of a fond memory gift to remind me of long ago... got it and watched it only to find out it's not the entire two part film. It's just part one. SO BEWARE if you're looking for the whole set.
5,Brilliantly Written and Acted,"Forget about your traditional Bollywood song & dance routines; this film has none of them, although its early scenes' background musical score is hauntingly beautiful. This is a very serious, intellectual, psychological De Maupassant-type drama based purely on sharply understated dialogue and rising emotional tension, as two former lovers, both miserable with their lots in life, meet and try to bridge the gap that has grown between them. The scenes are almost claustrophobic, taking place in only 3-4 very closed-in locations. It is the evolving relationship between Rai and Devgan, and their brilliant acting (try to imagine Aishwarya made up to look like a slightly frumpy housewife) that makes this film so enjoyable. A truly different milieu for Rai, who demonstrates an acting ability that few might have imagined she had. Slow-moving, episodic, sad and completely riveting."
1,This movie sucks,"I know it go awards in India, but I can't figure out why. It follows the storyline of the movie, Somewhere in Time .If you want to watch a movie where the entire film is set in one room and it's all dialog, then go for it. Being an Aish film, I expected more. Love Ajay Devgan too, but hated the character he played in this film. Do yourself a favor and watch these two together in Hum Dil De Chuke Sanaam instead. Which is a five-star film in my opinion."
4,question for those who read thatcher's books - not a review,"Hillary Clinton has mentioned that she went blond after reading Thatcher's autobiography.Why did Thatcher go blond?Thatcher's books don't list blond, bleach or hair in the index.I wish more books were in digital form.thanks."
4,Interesting,"Very good reading for any of us who want to understand international relationship a bit more. All throughout the book it is clear the subjective and partial view of the world that this Prime Minister had. One the other hand, it is book written by her and not a historical account created by a historian.Very educational!"
3,Downing Street Years,I should have been more careful reading the contents of this book. This is more about herlater political years. Not about her self and her beginnings.
4,Nice!,(2-EDITION) This book does contain some errors but is really easy to understand and read. I got the sybex book at it was harder to understand for a beginner. The information in this book is to the point. Finish it off with Exam Cram and you'll be fine on the test...
4,Looks Fantastic,This is a good chess set with very unique pieces. It is definitely a conversation starter. The set also folds up and is easy to be put a way when not in use.
4,Eclectic,This is an eclectic and well-performed collection. Something a little different and worth many listens.
1,Worthless...,"This... broke down the first month I had it. The most strain I placed on this thing was opening and closing the lid. It sat on my desk and worked okay for about a week. Pretty soon, I noticed the playback beginning to deminish on longer CD's. The next thing I know, everything is skipping...."
2,Short Lifespan!,"As other reviewers have mentioned, sound quality is quite good...but the this discman has no longevity! After only a couple of months of minimal use and no damage caused to the unit by me, the remote control simply ceased to function. Sure, it still plays CDs, but many of the useful features, navigation, etc. are completely lost without the remote. Go for a more durable brand like Sony."
2,Good for a short fling,"This mojo has an amazing sound and the remote is a very nice touch. It is very easy to navigate. (This is my second MP3/CD player). However, it died after only 3 months of use. So, purchase it with the extended warranty or you will be [cheated]."
2,It is not a tarp,"It is not a tarp, no grommets or attaching devices. It is a plastic film, cut out with the shape of the tent floor.If you are looking for a robust lining to protect your tent's floor from roots and sharp rocks I'll stick to a regular tarp. If all you need is a plastic film to keep humidity in check this is probably all you need."
5,Highly Amusing and Right on Target,It is amazing how little has changed since this book was written. The changes that have taken place are interesting to note. A great light read and a good joke gift for the snobby Bostonian on your list.
5,Great product!,This was exactly what I was looking for! It is an easy to use device with easy to follow instructions. You can also find great instructions on how to measure yourself (the included instructions need someone else to help you). Overall a great product at a great price!
2,My wifes dietician says it's not good,"Honestly, I thought this was a good unit, it seemed to do the job. But according to theDietician my wife saw, it's not good for these reasons.The calipers do not fully close, the jaws are misaligned and the spring is too strongso it isn't accurate and gives false readings.According to this caliper my wife has 7% bodyfat!Now if I as an unexperienced caliper user got these readings I'd think ok, so I'mdoing it wrong. But when a dietician that does this sort of thing all day long usesthem and it reads 7% you know it's off.My wife measures 13% bodyfat using the dieticians calipers.That's a 45% difference. So I'm returning it and buying the one her dietician uses.I'm hoping Amazon sells it, her dietician does not sell calipers."
3,skin caliper,The caliper works fine and the delivery was quick. I down rated this because it takes more than one person to use it.
5,Great Product,I am very happy with this product; It works as advertised. I recommend this product if you want really good skin-fold caliper.
2,It hurts,"This instrument feels really uncomfortable. For a sensitive person, it will leave red marks on the skin. I do not recommend this product."
1,Not accurate for body fat %,Do not buy this or any other impedance scale for body fat percentage. Just not accurate at all. Buy a simple digital scale for body weight only and save money.
5,Chapter 8 -Cause Stalking,"Length:: 9:59 MinsI made a slide show based on this book ""Stopping a Stalker"" by Captain Snow Chapter 8 Cause Stalking and includes notes of another bookCause Stalkingby Dave Lawson P.I.Police Officer Captain Robert Snow is the only police officer that we know of who recognizes the existence of stalking groups. [The rest of the Law Enforcement Community still on denial]. There is an abstract of this chapter in the MultiStalk online forums."
2,There really are no solutions here just a bunch of stalking stories,I bought this book because I thought it would provide me hardcore documentation on how to stop the stalkers. It really doesn't provide any solutions on getting the system to work for you. I do believe this cop tried to write a good book but is does fall flat on every level.
5,Take charge,"Transportation authorities may assure us that flying has never been safer. But why is it that pilots still want to carry guns? Perhaps they feel, as Bob Holt certainly does, that you can never feel too secure. A former Marine pilot, Bob wrote this book to share his own insights into the responsibility we all have to help make travel safe for everyone.I know Bob Holt personally, so I cannot be objective about his book. I watched him put everything aside in the months after September 11 in order to write it. His passion and his sincerity are real. His suggestions are certainly worth knowing, even if you don't agree with them. Who knows? They may be life-savers."
5,A life changer,"I attended a week long retreat where we used this book as a guide. I am not a very religious person at all, but this book changed my life. Merton challenges us to die to our false selves, to open our hearts to God and to accept contemplation of the mystery of God and his creations as the center of our lives. As an introduction to Merton and as a daily spiritual guide, this book is priceless."
2,Nothing to do with NIN,Nothing to do with NIN cept for the title. It's mildly humorous but pretty stupid nonetheless
3,Pictures and all you could want to know about a some guns,"A great guide to weapons, good statistics. tells everything about the weapons listed. only problem is that there is not enough guns listed. good pictures and descriptions. i like this book"
3,Rear portions too short for VW Jetta wagon,"Although the fit list said it would fit my VW Jetta Sportwagon, the rear vents are about 2 inches too short. I tried to return, but with shipping, restockinand getting something else in its place that may/not fit I just ate it and used the front vents which did fit nicely and are typically the set of windows I crack anyway. I am sure they fit the sedan which has slightly shorter rear windows."
4,Miraculous Reading!,"I found this book making me LOOOOONNNNNGGGG for planning a trip to Cabo & the Sea of Cortez and all along Baja. I ordered this book so that I could help my daughter write a paper for one of her marine biology classes. It had all the perfect ingredients: habitat and ecology discussions; cultures that affect the marine life; whimsical and historical accounts of people, places and events; and a most interesting narrative. I recommend this for a summer reading!"
5,"If you can't see Rembrandt in person, this is the book",This box set is the most prized possession on my bookshelf. I could not possibly do the pictures and information in this book justice with words. Some of the most amazing detail photographs of Rembrandt's surfaces that I have ever seen.
2,You get what you pay for,The lighted dial failed in less than a month. Try dealing with Timex on a warranty. It cost more than the watch. It does keep time. Not reccomended.
5,Men's watch`,Very easy to set the time and the day. Watch band feels loose on my wrist and that's the way I like it.
5,Who's a Control Freak?,"As a previously self-diagnosed Control Freak, this book is a real eye opener. Good for both the CF and those who live or work with CF's. An honest appraisal and reading of the suggestions was very helpful."
4,It's helping me,"A good book, especially if YOU are the control freak. I'm still working at it; it's a day-to-day struggle to realize that overcontrolling only hurts those you love."
4,Finally someone who understands!,"My mother is the biggest control freak I have ever met. I never knew there were other people out there that were just like her. Granted, I have known other control freaks, but they paled in comparison to my mom, so they were tolerable. While the message I got from this book was a little frustrating (you can't change a control freak), it was still reassuring to know that my father and I are not the only people in this world who have had to deal with this type of person."
1,Buyer Beware,I found this book simplistic with frequent calling on religion to automatically solve presupposed conditions. I also question the morality of teaching religious superstition as a method for permanent behavioral change. The author used Bill Gates and Walt Disney as prime examples of control freaks which to me indicates if you want to be very successful and make a significant contribution to American society you should hone your abilities as a control freak. Buyer beware.Ronnie.
1,WWWWAAYYYY Too much god talk,Entirely too much god talk for me. Telling people to relinquish control by realizing god is the only one who can control everything? Not sufficiently in-depth for my taste.
4,decent pizza pan,Recieved this pizza pan and used it to make a chicago style deep dish pizza. The pizza was great and the pan did a fine job of holding the pizza. My only concern was there was a lot of metal residue (from the manufacturer?) that needed to be washed off of the pan before use. I'm looking forward to trying it again.
5,Dani,"Great! Bought for my boyfriend, very happy with the product :)ATB never lets you down. This album has some great tracks on it and I think everyone should add this to their personal music collection."
5,my favorite album from this dj-,ATB does it again- this is my favorite album of his- great dvd- one of those albums I can listen to over and over again
5,Great Example of what ATB can do,Wonderful mix of vocals and that mind numbing sound that ATB brings to the record. A great pick if you are a ATB fan
5,Incredible,"But has anyone noticed the inconsistencies with the bonus disc?First, where's the Marrakech [Live @ Nowhere Mix]?Second, why are there two Alex M.O.R.P.H.'s Synthetic Empire Mixes? They've even listed it twice.I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything."
4,Very Strong and Consistent,"Most dance/techno artists seem to have awesome music and super cheesy lyrics that often times are random and make no sense at all. However I was astonished at how stong the lyrical content on this album was. The first 5 tracks are very consistent and strong, and I really enjoyed the third track, Autumn Leaves. Excellent song. Towards the end of the cd there is a little bit of filler, maybe just two songs. But then Intencity clocks in and is the second or third strongest track on the album. Overall, its a great album and unfortunatley I cannot same the same for the dvd portion. The video for Extacy is lackluster, and the Andre seems a little vain in having himself plastered all over the place. But overall, this is a great album."
3,Learn & Sing,"I actually bought my video in the UK where it isn't called Fun With Music. It's called 101 Notes Of Fun, and the only noteable difference between the US and UK version, is the UK's addition of the song ""Cruella De Vil"" from 101 Dalmations.Of all the Disney Sing Along Songs videos this is probably the most mature. In it, Mr Owl teaches you quite a bit about music, as well as allowing you to have fun singing along. A commendable collection of Disney songs are here- my favorite was ""Good Company"" from Oliver & Company- very sweet."
1,Frustrated by Junk,"This machine will only frustrate you.The instructions are poorly compiled and written. They do not link with the software and ..., you find that the machine cannot deliver on its advertised speed.I would NEVER buy another thing from this manufacturer."
1,Save your money,"Upon removing supposedly ""new"" unit from box, discovered marred ""level"" adjustment screw indicating prior misuse. Unit did not work because of poor transmission and faulty female jack plug on transmitter. More than 30 days elapsed between the time I bought the unit and when it was first used and the vendor selling thru Amazon refused to honor a refund or replacement citing their obscure return policy. This device is poorly constructed, cheaply made, non-functional and, in my opinion, misrepresented as factory new when it appeared to be otherwise."
3,El Cheapo!,"Your get what you pay for... bag is made of patch leather, really cheap although it still is holding up well after a few years but not a Pro Bag you take to the office.. its for casual use only! Made in china!"
3,It is too simple and basic,This is really for a beginner of backyard players. It is not for beginner of serious players.
4,Everyone should read Bret Lott,"Many of these stories are so short and spare that you feel you may have missed something along the way. But they linger with you long after you've finished reading. They are about normal people much like ourselves, and they face problems and heartbreaks the same as ours. Mr. Lott is a masterful writer"
4,very light...,"I love my golf bag - it is very light (only about 3.5lb) and has plenty of compartments. However, I won't give a 5 for the quality. After about a year, the club dividers have started to peel off and giving me a bit of a problem whenever I try to pull or put my clubs back in the bag. It is not something that could not be fixed with some glues, but I expected it would lasted longer."
4,This is great,"The only negative I have for this product is the knobs that you ajust for angle and height of the stand. They tend to slip, but, not by much. The positives, if you do a lot of data entry, your work is in front of you and your no longer looking off to the side trying to locate your line. I love this product..."
2,Not up to 3M usual high quality products.,"I do like the fact that this stand has adjustable angles but am taken aback by the price/design ratio. The way that the legs attach to the sides of the support makes the stand wobbly if you are putting heavy books on it. The 3M engineers did not do their usual excellent job with design on this product.The elastic band is basically like a rubberband my daughter uses in her hair, with two plastic attachments to it. For this price a few extras should have been included. I had envisioned my kids using it to hold up textbooks when working on homework and this stand simply cannot handle the weight.Overall, it works ok, but for this price it should be much sturdier and be nearly perfect."
1,cumbersome and heavy,I was looking for something to hold up my papers as I was writing at the computer. It was supposed to fit between the keyboard and the monitors but it did not. And it was quite heavy to move.
2,Seems poor for the price,"For the price I expected better (as did some other reviewers). I shouldn't have spent so much money on this. The quality & design is worth about $25 in my opinion, not what I ended up paying, even on a lightening deal.I'm worried this thing won't last and that it will break at what seems like a weak point where the supports hold the clear plastic piece.So based on the poor value & that it seems it will break at the ""weak point"", I only feel comfortable giving this 2 stars."
3,Very good for large books,"This stand is really good for large books, like albums or something like that. However it does take up a lot of space and therefore it's too much for anything smaller and when I tried it with my 14"" laptop it didn't hold very well. Maybe something like a tablet would be a better fit..."
4,Only one complaint...,"First of all, I LOVE this product. It is well-consructed. It uses quality material. It is a great size for most books, and it just looks beautifully professional on my desk.It tils back easily so you can read at a couple of angles. However, as useful as the ledge on the bottom is for stopping the book from slipping off, it also makes page turning difficult because it cannot be removed nor is it mobile.The base/legs cannot be set in a perfectly straight angle, but that's probably just me being anal."
2,Clunky,"When I got this product I realized it was extremely heavy and complex to put together. Not exactly what I thought I would be getting. Then unpacking I realized it took up a huge footprint on my limited desk space. This thing is just too big for a regular person's desk and more fitting to be in some kind of industrial fabrication plant. Seriously, the design is old and not very useful. It's also severely overpriced."
2,"Might be good for holding books, but for papers it's a bust","This product weighs a ton, or at least way more than a document holder made for sheets of paper. Also, unless your monitor is well above the desk, anything you put in this will block the screen, plus you need room front to back room between your keyboard and monitor. Buy this only if you have the space and need the holder for heavy items. For papers (e.g., contracts, homework) use a document holder that is longer top to bottom (or tape the pages one at a time to a top corner of your monitor)."
2,Needs improvement and too expensive,"Useful but you need a big desk to find room for this! Also, the price is too much for what you get. Also, kind of wobbly.I would not recommend this for the price. It should either be better designed or half the price. And I don't mean half the list price; I mean half the $60 Amazon price. And even that would be pushing it."
2,Not worth the money,This was a horribly boring video that did nothing to raise my heart rate. I can't believe they call this advance. Even the people in the video looked bored. I am sad I can't return it.
4,The integrity of Soul,"Ohiyesa wrote from his heart about a world for which the western world had no language. Here is a man who was truly caught between two cultures. Raised Lakota, educated as a western physician and fated to be on the Rosebud Reservation during the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre, his destiny was to leave a record of what the First Peoples truly believed, and why.His language swings from simple to more formal. It is obvious that he wants to influence the more well educated western culture of his time. Often, he is awkward. But, always, the soul and integrity of what he is saying shines through.This book is meant for all who have native blood in their veins and for those who need to understand those that do. It echos the humility that is at the core of all our beliefs. It explains the Integrity of Soul that we have been searching for these many years."
3,Nothing special,"I bought this book on a whim and turned out not to be what I expected. It's a nice easy read but it lacks depth. The text is rather large so the 170 pages would be much less if normal. You definately have to be in the right frame of mind and appreciate the simplicity or you will be disappointed. Overall, a worthwhile read."
1,Surf City Teresa - PLEASE DON'T STEREOTYPE GIRLS,"I consider Surf City Teresa very mediocre. I wouldn't reccomend it to children with vicious dogs, cats, or other animals that might choke on the doll's shredded head, hair, feet, or other parts that easily come off. It is not very fun for children with little imagination, as the dolls can get boring and end up either with their heads pulled off, in the ""Barbie Pile"", or fed to the bulldog. As Barbie Dolls go, they can get boring after awhile and are not educational.(...)"
3,Another uneven presentation,"For a clearly talented, world class, singer, most of Jane Monheit's recordings come across as disappointingly uneven, and I found this no exception. The audio quality and every element of production, including the arrangements and playing, are absolutely spectacular, and even more so as a DVD-Audio. And some tracks are almost wholly satisfactory. But one wishes that her sensuous, melodious, and naturally swinging voice and genuine jazz feel were not often marred by awkwardly inserted scat mannerisms, that her portamento did not degrade into the 'searching for the note' syndrome, and that purity of tone more consistently matched being able to hit notes square on. It is very hard to find modern jazz singers who can match the technical and artistic heights reached by the greatest singers of the 40's and 50's, many of whose works are now being skillfully remastered."
1,Runon Paradise,"I agree completely with the previous reviewer. If I did not have to read this book for a course I am taking I would not have bought it. Sentences are obsqure, incomprehensible, internally contradictory, tend to be at least three lines or longer and may not contain verbs.I think there may be some useful information in the book but gleaning it requires multiple readings of sentences and leaps of faith.There is considerable irony here because of the book's title."
1,Faith based enviromentalism.,"This is a faith based environmentalism - that is you must believe in the 'idea' of the free market for it to work. And sorry to say, that faith has been tested and found wanting. Just in the past few years - nay decades - we have seen various ways in which the 'free market' has been co-opted and corrupted - from the S&L scandal. energy de-reg, to the various post-bubble stock market scandals. And now the authors want to place our natural resources into the hands of the free market?No thank you sirs.Better laws and total reviews of suspect agencies like the BLM and Army Corp. than this so called 'free market.'"
5,"Very good quality, worth the extra $","I am very pleased with the quality of the CDs. I love burning my own music, and the previous brand I used would always get rejected by my Beemer's music system towards the end of the CD. Not the TDK's though. Totally worth the few more dollars!"
1,dont use these for the philips cd recorder,I bought 4 packages of these and they were all defective/not for digital audio music recorders. I called tdk which make IMATION media. They told me to check out each disk and send them the defective ones. Well all 200 are defective. So they are gonna send me the correct ones for my recorder. My dual cd philips machine didnt recognize these disks which say tdk music. The recorder rejected every one. Either it gave a error or said insert disc meanwhile it was in there. I dont recommend these model # discs for the philips dual cd recorder. I always bought tdk all my life and since Imation is involved i no longer buy them. I use maxell only for the dual philips recorder. I bought 200 discs and work flawlessly. If you have the philips cd-r dual deck use the maxells they are worth it. They say on them cd-r music for DIGITAL AUDIO 80 min and are used for the philips dual deck.
1,Bum Deal!!!,"Only half of these cd`s would work, terrible product!! Stay away from!!!!!This is a shame because I bought these discs years ago when I bought my cd burner and these discs were the top of the line.....well they`ve fallen!"
2,Disapointed with shipping,the cd's that I ordered were priced right and I had ordered another product that I expected to be shipped together with the cd's.I could have bought the cd's cheaper at several stores locally after shipping was added to the price
1,Garbage,"I recently started using my Phillips component CD recorder again to transfer vinyl to digital. I was hoping that the 1 star reviews were wrong. I took a chance and bought these, relying on TDK's solid name. I remember years ago, before ipods and mp3's were everywhere, that I used TDK music CD-R's because they were better than the other brands. Memorex was notoriously awful. I would put the Memorex music CD-R in the CD recorder and that dreaded OPC Error message would pop up. It was very frustrating. Unfortunately, that is exactly what has happened with about half of the TDK music CD-R's. I might as well buy the Memorex music CD-R's since they are half the price ($9.99) at Office Depot; and they are of the same quality. It's really too bad that TDK is willing to sell this inferior product. Does anyone know of any music CD-R's that are reliable?"
1,These are not the same as the ones I've bought in the past!,"These are not the same as the ones I've bought in the past. They are junk. Already lost half of them, because they will not burn correctly. JUNK< JUNK< JUNK!"
1,Poor quality or not for stand alone CD recorders,"So, these are supposed to work in stand alone CD recorders? Not quite. When the CD's arrived. half of the CD's I tried in my recorder weren't recognized (no OPC) and those that did, I had to put in my machine more than once in order for my machine to recognize the OPC code, so I could record on the disc. Hmm, not exactly what I was looking for, so they are going back. Guess I should have stuck with Maxell. I'll be correcting that mistake as I return these discs."
1,Not so good,"I recently purchased a 50 pack of the TDK music audio CD-R's as well as a memorex 50 pack. The memorex worked great, 100% usable. The TDK not so much. So far I am seeing about 90% failure rate. Either my CR recorder (Philips brand) can't recognize it, or if it does, it won't finalize it after recording. Would not recommend these to anyone. However, different recorders react differently. Mine doesn't like the TDK brand. Recommend buying a single CD-R or two and trying out before investing in a whole spindle of coasters."
1,"""RIP OFF""","THESES ARE NOT THE TDK MUSIC CD-R'S OF OLD WITH THE WHITE FINISH. THESE DISC ARE POOR QUALITY. A COMPLETE RIP OFF. NO BETTER THAN ANY OF THE BRANDS OUT THERE. SUCH AS SONY, ETC. SAVE YOUR MONEY. ALSO SAME HIGH FAILURE RATE. I'M VERY SORRY I WASTED GOOD MONEY ON THIS PURCHASE THINKING I WAS GETTING THE SAME QUALITY OF OLD. BUT THESE ARE NOT THE SAME, NO BETTER AND COST TWICE WHAT THE SONY'S COST AND MAYBE THEIR EVEN A POORER QUAlITY."
5,TDK 50 Pack cdr media for music,Purchased 200 TDK CDR'S FOR MUSIC THERE PERFECT RECIEVED THEM IN A FEW DAYS AM COMPLETELY SATISFIED. WILL ORDER AGAINGeorge New Jersey
2,M60 deserves better,"John Dreger hit it home!This ""book"" is not worth the money! There are better publications covering the M60 than this ""concoction""!Stay away from this ""book"", even the old Squadron Signal is better! And this makes me wonder!"
2,A brave attempt,"This is a brave attempt to construct a praxis of a Liberation Theology for Christian Palestinians. Unfortunately brave and attempt is all it is. The theology falls down because Ateek's exegesis is at best simplistic. While Ateek criticises 'Jews' for their exegesis, he uses only First Testament examples and not particularly well at that. I would have liked to see Ateek use, for example, one of the birth narratives as his base Biblical study.Ateek confuses with his seemingly interchangaeable use of 'Zionist' and 'Jew'. The book lacks the rigour of Gutierrez Sobrino and Boek, and adds little to the litertaure of Liberation Theology. He should be credited though, with raising the profile of Palestinian Christians, a small and often forgotten minority."
5,Israel Brutality Revealed,"This book reveals the abject brutality of Israel towards the Palestinians. The author is a Christian Palestinian who has been a strong voice for justice in the Middle East. However, his voice is drowned out by the propoganda machine of Israel."
1,false and fake,"If you are really interested in the Middle East history, read the documentary study ""Palestine Is Our Land And The Jews Are Our Dogs"" conducted by Professor Francisco J. Gil-White. This is the best published scientific article on the Middle East history.[...]Mark Bernadiner, Pearland, Texas"
1,Horrible! I wish I'd give it zero stars!,Somebody PLEASE take that damn microphone away from Mr. Hung!!!!He butchered one of my favorite Richard Marx songs. You are a complete fool to even like this guy! He's terrible!
5,So bad its good!,"The one star review by Diogenes misses the point completely. This is a novelty album where the performance is obviously bad, but Hung's spirit triumphs over his shall we say modest vocal skills. The cheesiness of the production just adds to its campy appeal. The great thing is that he's actually making money doing this- an inspiration to everyone with a dream. It makes a great gift!"
1,Gong Show Reject,"William Hung is a personable young man. I regret to say that the the only miracle in his ""Miracles - Happy Summer"" CD was that someone actually produced it.I hope that he has other talents besides ""guts,"" because singing is NOT one of them.If he were on the ""GONG SHOW,"" the GONG would have sounded immediately after the first few ""off-key"" notes erupted from his mouth."
1,Oh Willam Hung... I'll BANG ON YOUR FACE!,Willam Hung sucks! They probably got him a record deal cause he was desprite and probably cried like a little girl on American Idol! That's how bad he sucks! Don't buy this CD cause it can probably cause the world to crie of is suckingness then the whold world will be angry tears! Willam Hung please stop singing!
4,A good companion to the soundtrack,"If you own the 2xCD soundtrack for Radiata stories, then you're probably going to want to add this arrane album to your collection as it compliments the soundtrack very well. There are some exclusive tracks here, as well as longer versions of tracks from the soundtrack. Also the inclusion of vocals is on here a lot."
1,Good Book unacceptable Kindle formatting,The footnotes in this title as presented are not hot linked with the text. Getting to them is a very clumsy process. One would need to copy from Kindle all the footnotes into a word processing file (I did it for chapter 1 and it took too long it all!). Since I had a copy of the book I went to the copy machine and did all the footnotes separately from the book. I called Amazon regarding it. They said it would be looked into and they would get back to me by email. That has not happen.
1,Buyer beware,"Readers might want to first read the following review before purchasing:http://www.rabbisaul.com/watersreview.htmI would recommend Frank Thielman's _Paul & the Law_ for a good appraisal of the promise and perils of the so-called ""new perspective."""
4,Partial Review,"I am only commenting on the first three tracks of this CD, which are the Second Symphony of Rostislav Boiko. This is a highly colored, tonal work, which is Russian in its essence. Dedicated to the then Leningrad, it is to me highly evocative and intensely colored.Most amazing is the second movement - clangorous and frenzied with some of the most amazing brass I have ever heard. In the background is a Dies Irae like motive. Alas it is too short, but it is a lovely thing nonetheless.In the final movement, the Andante Cantabile, I found the calm which follows the storm. The brass is again sweeping, and not as frenzied. It paints a epic portrait of a great city and its proud people.I am the better for having heard this wonderful music."
5,Ideal for small animals!,"Make no mistake, you shouldn't try to keep animals in the Kritter Keeper indefinitely if they are of any real size (larger than a few inches) or if they are fish. However, these containers are absolutely ideal for insects and other creepy-crawlies like spiders, centipedes, worms, and any other ""bug"". I highly recommend these for people who catch bugs outdoors in warm weather. Great for kids!By the way, I wouldn't rely on that handle. It looks a tad flimsy. Carry the Keeper by its sides."
3,OK for big bugs.,"The holes in the top make this unusable (without modification) for containing many insects.The slats that you can see in the picture are big enough for many bugs to escape. What you can't see in the picture, is that for some reason the designers decided to add 2 much larger holes on one side of the top...These holes are big enough to allow a Yellowjacket to escape. (Ask me how I know.)"
5,7th heaven - Faces Time Replaces,First CD.. Very Powerfull & Full of energy... Some Songs on this CD were Featured on MTV's Making The Video in July/August - 2000
3,Great Seller. Okay Item.,The seller of this item was excellent! Top ratings. We'd buy from them again. The item itself is good. Not great. Not bad either.
4,Good enough,The velcro for the wire placement is weak and seems to be peeling off just after two weeks. Besides the weak velcro the armband works fine for working out.
4,Wish one thing was different,I consider this a great buy for my old ipod shuffle. It works great for my work-outs or for working in the yard. The only thing I wish was different was the way to tighten it-I wish it had a velcro strap instead of a pull-through buckle. It would be a little easier to pull on and off my arm. Overall I'm still happy with the purchase and would still buy this product again if I could not find one with velcro.
2,A little bit louder now,"I purchased the Clarity w1000 to overcome the noise from a room air conditioner. It usually worked adequately for this task. However, sometimes or perhaps often a little more volume would have been useful. On my phone line, increased volume quickly turns into quite a bit of noise and hiss. This is more annoying than straining to hear the caller. My Panasonic KX-TG 5421 cordless phone with voice enhancer turns out to work better than the w1000. I probably should have returned the w1000."
5,Great for Hearing Impaired,"My mom's hearing impaired and received this product free from the Florida phone company years and years ago, due to her impairment. Although we tried newer phones that had volume controls in other rooms, this is the only one that works for her. Now she has one in the kitchen and one in the TV room. It's not cordless, but it's not necessary that it has that function for her."
2,Not that great,"I work from home and bought this phone based on reviews I had seen in the past saying it was great for making sure you can be heard and understood. This phone is almost as bad as the one I got rid of when I purchased this one. I have tons of issues with and echo when using the handset. I can not find a head set that works with this phone as it has a 3.5mm jack instead of the more common 2.5mm jack. I thought I was getting a great phone that would make all this worth the trouble, but the sound is not any better then a $5 drugstore special. I am very disapointed in the quality."
3,clarity phone,"The phone is fine. As you can see by the picture there are no cords displayed SO I purchased them for extra money. Also per the picture , I thought the phone was white... it is beige. So OK on the phone Terrible on the picture."
2,Questionable quality,"When I tried to set the switch on the bottom to keep the Boost feature permanently on, small pieces for the switch fell off. I had a hard time trying to collect the pieces and get them back together. I ended up holding it back on with tape. There was one small copper piece that was left over. The phone is working for now with the boost on, but for how long I don't know."
1,Walker Clarity W1000 Amplified phone,"Worked briefly, but not well. Soon topped working entirely. Returned for credit, as Amazone said ir could not send another. Useless."
4,Does what it says,"Needed these for noisy kitchens and they work just as advertised. If we need more phones, we will get these."
4,Awesome power to the Amplifier.,"This equipment plays really awesome, the output power it gives out to my amplifier is more than enough than i had needed. I had to turn the Master volume down to 35-40% so i can have normal output power going to my amplifier, My mixers don't even have that much power going to my Dj amplifier and i'm using a Pyramid PZA-100 which is also a very good amplifier for regular gigs and the sound quality from both is excellent. I turned up the Pre-amp to the maximum power just to test the power handling to the Amplifier and it plays crystal clear no distortion. But i had my amplifier turned up to 75% power because if i had turned it up more the amplifier will clip out because of the speakers i was using."
4,"Somewhat noisy, but still a good deal","I use this mixer as a supplement to the power mixer in my rack, for situations where I have too many line inputs. The 15v phantom power is not so great, and it's only on half of the inputs, so I never use it for mics. The mixer adds a noticeable amount of noise if the volumes are up very high, but fortunately for me, I never need the knobs above 2, and everything is fine.For the price, it works well."
4,Great Biography of the Entire Teutal Family!!,"I found this book to be an excellent insight into the Teutuls. It was a refreshingly honest look at Paul Sr.'s drug riddled past and how he has battled those demons. The talks about the beginning of the iron works business and how exactly they began OCC. You get a good background of each of the Teutals, including Jr., Mikey, Paula Teutal (ex-wife and mom to his kids), Grandma Teutal. There are chapters by Rick Petko and Vinney that are interesting as well. I have, for some reason, always respected and found Paul Sr. to be an excellent manager of people and find it interesting that many people just see his argueing and screaming, but at the same time his workers seem to always respect him, which means that we are not seeing the other side of him on the TV show.Excellent read if you like OCC or just enjoy the motorcycle industry!"
5,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome book","If you are a fan of the OCC, this book is a must. It is funny, yet has it's serious moments. I have a totally new respect for Sr., as he goes into the history of his drug and alcohol abuse. What he has made of his life since becoming a Christian and being drug and alcohol clean is nothing short of a miracle. The book has some great pictures, and the boys have written chapters as well. You see the serious side of Paulie, and the silly side of Mikey. I also enjoyed the other employee's points of view and how they came to work for the OCC. Wouldn't it be great to meet them? I just want to shake their hand and tell them thank you for appreciating their fans."
3,The prequel sister volume is better,"i owned this for awhile and it's alright. but volume one i think is a little better...although i'm sure it's a helluva better sounding cd when your ""all ate up""(ha! ha!, u got that one orlando ravers)."
3,Typical Orlando,This is what a typical night in an Orlando club would sound like. Has a few good tunes but most have that cheesy commercial pop feel. Good CD if you like the breaks that are played on the radio.
4,A good album,This is a good album. Their previous album Endytime was a bad album. Here they return to The carnival Bizarre formula with doom songs that have passion. Its not so good as Carnival but definitely an album that any Cathedral fan must have.
2,Lacking in Every Area,"This is the worst release I could've imagined by this band. This band is capable of so much more. Previous releases like 'The Ethereal Mirror,' 'Carnival Bizarre,' and the 'Soul Sacrifice' EP prove the worth of this ensemble. The mood of this release almost seems that this band has run out of ideas. The guitar and bass chords are flat and repetitive, and the drums are less-than-respectable. This release is as much fun to listen to as an insurance seminar."
2,poop!!!,you've got to be kidding!this vocalist is embarresing.he cannot sing a notewhy he attempts to sing is beyond me.avoid at all costs!
4,3/5,"I received 3 of these today. They were in perfect condition except one which had a slight crack at the bottom of the cage. No big problem, and the crack will not be noticeable at all. Other than that I have no complaints. The product shipped fast and was just as described. I'm satisfied with this purchase."
3,Pro's and Con's if used for fish,Pro...the price for three gallon size is greatPro...It's made in the USABut...Con...It's made of very thin plastic and cracks easily so I would not get this to hold fish. I barely bumped the Kritter Keeper and it put a crack at the bottom which means you have to be VERY CAREFUL when you clean this thing out in the sink to not bump it.So I would not recommend this to hold betta fish or any fish at all since it cracked so easily.
3,Only works if using large feeders,"Be aware that the ventilation slates on the lid are wide enough for small crickets,roaches, fruit flies, etc feeders to escape with ease.If you feed your pet large prey items, like large crickets, worms, etc. then this willwork fine.Also, the lid on these are hard to pry off once snapped on.I used a stone sander on my Dremmel to work down the snaps in the lid corners and apiece of sanpaper to work down the edges of the container rim. Now it's easy to removethe lid.You can also hot glue measured and cut pieces of screen to cover the large ventilationslits on the lid, making it escape proof for the smallest feeders, like fruit flies.But this is a lot of work.I have 4 kritter keepers which have been modified this way."
5,Wonderful Seller,"This seller is fantastic, professional and has a great product. The price is good , shipping good and fast. Customer service is top notch!The item is perfect for a class pet mouse it fits an exercise wheel food and place to sleep."
4,Great for Bettas,Don't bother with those itty Betta bowls that they try to sell to you. This leaves plenty of room for the fish to swim. My betta Dawn loves her new home. So much better than what they keep them in stores. The only thing is if you use this for an aquarium don't pick it up by the plastic handles. This holds about 3 gallons of water.
1,Dissappointed,"The item was received cracked with no lid. My niece has to send it back, she has three small children, a spouse, full time employment and attends college. Not the hassle I wanted to give her when I purchased the item for her."
1,Paint doesn't dry,"My two-year old loves the finger paint but it does not dry after being applied. The spots where it wasn't too gloppy dried eventually (after about a week) but were still tacky. The glops never dried. I had to throw away every piece of art my son made. Also, my set was missing the sponges. The colors are very pretty but as another reviewer said, the colors easily get mixed up and become unusable. I intend to throw these away and try Crayola."
2,One time mess,"I will have to say my little one was able to make a couple pictures before all the paints got mixed together, then the paints just kind of became a brown soupy mess. I was disappointed that the sponges didn't stamp on the paper better and that it really is just a one time craft."
2,Don't waste your time,"I was looking forward to this all in one kit to try finger painting for the first time with my 4 year old son. It comes with many paints in closable cups, but its hard to paint out of them, without tainting the other colors and making mud. The paint is gloppy and never dries (its been a week, especially the yellow). The sponges are very small and don't take up the paint or make a clear stamped impression. The ""finger paint"" paper is some small glossy paper, about the size of a half sheet of printer paper. Bonus, comes with two popcicle sticks! Go get the crayola paints and pour small amounts into paper cups, so the whole pot doesn't become icky brown and mixed."
4,"LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!!","I absoultely LOVE this album!! I hadn't heard Saving Jane before and kinda just found them while downloading some other songs. I downloaded Come down to Me and fell in love with it. I then preceeded to download ever song and burned them to a CD, it has been in my CD player for a week now I listen every chance I get!! I LOVE SAVING JANE. Can't wait for the next album!!"
5,Good music,"When i heard ""Girl Next Door"" over the internet radio i right away loved it. I bought the cd and i love every song in it.This rock-pop album is one of my favorites. With this album she became my new favorite musician.I just like every song."
5,awesome!,"oh man..i just finished checking out the new cd ""Girl Next Door"" and wow! it just sent me into awe! she has a fantastic voice backed with amazing lyrics and beautiful music..it makes for one awesome cd! you guys should really check it out..and tell everyone you know about them too! you'll really be glad that you did!"
5,Fabulous!!!!,"If your looking for a fresh new sound, check out Saving Jane's Girl Next Door. Unlike any other band I have heard in a real long time, and that's a good thing! It's nice to hear something so refreshing! The lyrics relate to almost anyone...doesn't matter where you come from I'm sure you'll be able to relate to at least one of the songs. My favorite...Ordinary!"
5,Outstanding!,"Outstanding is the one word I would use to sum up how I feel about this. Not a single bad track on the entire CD! Music,lyrics and vocals it has it all. I hope to start hearing other tracks on the radio very soon.~suzanne"
1,Not worth A million dollars!!!,"I tried this, and after paying $1,000,000 for it, I have to say it's not worth it! There are so many cheaper ones out there. I was hoping for 24K gold dust or something. Boy was I duped!!"
3,Schiff Joint Free Powder,I've ordered for schiff joint Free. My two past orders were already recieved. But when Im trying to place my order again. i can't completemy order when checking out. Its says it not covered by your geographicalarea coverage. I want to order more in the future. Pls advise. Need your reply.
2,Better in Concert,"So I remember years ago going to a few of CI's concerts and they were dope. After seeing this CD I thought it would be just as good but either my memory is fading or something because I was not impressed by this CD. I really don't think my memory is THAT bad so my only conclusion is that they are better entertainers/performers than in the studio. I ain't trying to hate and love supporting local music but it is what it is. Maybe the songs will grow on me, after listening to it more, if my views change then I will update my review..."
5,Hilarious,"Love, love love this series. It is absolutely hilarious. I watch an episode while I'm jogging on my treadmill and the time just flies. I recommend this to anyone who needs a good laugh"
5,Family Enjoyment,"Our family has greatly enjoyed watching ""Psych"" together. We find it funny, clean and interesting."
5,fantastic,i really enjoyed my dvd's that i purchased.they arrived quickly and in the condition promised.
3,Nt bad,"I wasn't the seller's fault but the album only has two songs with Philip bailey on it, The description made it seem like he was a part of the group."
4,A Good Tool -- Book AND Cassette,"I've used this series in Egyptian and other dialects to brush up before visiting various places. It is excellent to get conversational/survival skills up to speed in a short time. It is also good to get an ear for certain dialects and see their quirks.I already had experience with Arabic before using this. Regardless, I would warn that it is ESSENTIAL that you acquire BOTH the book and the cassette. I can't see either as useful separately. The marketing for this, especially on the web, is fairly vague since they are available as a set and as casette and book separately.There is no reason why this wouldn't be a good gateway for a person to learn aural arabic skills. The book is done entirely in transliterated latin text -- no Arabic script. And it works fairly well, especially if all you want to do is get around in Egyptian.I recommend this set. If you have a limited budget, this set and a Lonely Plant or Rough Guide Egyptian phase book would get you pretty far. ..."
1,Good only if you're interested in advanced conjugation,"I am travelling to Egypt and wanted to learn some Arabic. I bought this product because ""colloquial"" sounded good. But I find it completely useless. The words on the tape are read much too quickly, and I find myself flipping frantically through the book trying to find the lessons that are being read. It focuses on very advanced grammar and a lot of weird idioms. There is virtually nothing useful to me on it."
2,Too much a novel,I am afraid I do not like this type of story about a saint. I prefer facts and not supposition.
4,Tasty,"This is very tasty, but I am a little disappointed that there is not more pineapple and nuts in the mixture."
4,Great Crunch,"Udi's has great crunch and flavor. Love the macadamia and dried pineapple addition. It could use a few more of each of these, as they seem to pour out in the first few bowlfuls, and then you are left with none."
5,Best of the bunch,"I bought the sampler pack (this is included) and this is my favorite of them all. I like the original, vanila and cranberry too but if I had to pick one, this is it. The dried pineapple is wonderfully sweet."
1,Well THAT was a disaster...,"Great Gertie's Nightgown! ""The Best Movie Ever!"" You're kidding me right? Either that or you're 12. ""Backwoods"" is yet another feeble attempt at telling a worn-out story. Haven't we beat this horse to death yet?The plot line is something like this: some en-tre-preneurs decide to go paint balling over the weekend. In the country. In the backwoods. Alone. No guns. Nothing to protect themselves. Scared yet? Neither was I. While there, they encounter a bunch of goons who've decided they need fresh women in order to breed with a hatchet-weilding troglodyte so they can keep the ""new race"" up to snuff.What follows is very lame, very boring, and very awful. The movie lasts 84 minutes (you'll swear it's more like 8-1/2 hours), is directed with about as much verve as a turnip, and is rated R. Haylie Duff screams a lot and wears boots. Pitiful."
1,Another piece of trash.,"We've seen this before. Bunch of stupid kids or in this case young guys going into the wilderness on the weekend just to get high, drink beer, get laid and pheraps get killed by a stupid psychopathic. Nothing but crap."
3,Seen better,Who are these backwoods people anyway? Part religious cult and something else? What is with this strange lab. where they have to wear hazzard suits and gas mask making something? Why to they like having captured women impregnated? Too many unknowns for me. Not enough gore for my liking. Just a ok film.
2,It must of sucked...,"I remember renting this movie and watching it. Now, not even an month later I couldn't tell ya a thing about it... Thats how much it stood out to me... If I remember correctly the acting was horrid, it had a couple wannabe stars in it and was just like every other movie thats came before it, only lamer. If it wasn't for the cover art I'd have forgotten all about this movie, entirely!"
3,"For a TV movie, not bad.","Taking it's cue from classics like Deliverence, Southern Comfort, and a little (and I mean very little) from The Hills Have Eyes. Backwoods is a survival horror film with a semi predictable plot, minimal gore, and a decent amount of action to give it enough legs making it into a watchable movie. The only hiccup I have is that it lacks suspense and atmospshere to truly make it an effective horror film. But I like it enough to watch it the whole way through, and would give it another view. Definetly not a film for torture and gore hounds, But for a Spike TV produce film made for tv, it's not bad."
3,beware of the woods...,"When a gaming engineer is asked by her boss to join a company paintball battle in the remote wilderness, she eagerly accepts. But when the woods reveal a hidden band of savage survivalists, the city folks must come to terms with their own brutal killer instincts- or suffer an unthinkable fate.This movie reminded me of the movie ""U Turn"" and the movie ""Hostel"". The plot is sort of a cross between those two films."
2,Disappointed,"The DVD arrived in perfect condition, brand new as the seller stated. The movie itself though is not worth your money. I watched about a half hour of it on the sci-fi channel and decided it looked good so I bought it from Amazon. But watching I whole movie, I realized it is very stupid and pathetic. If you think you're interested in it, I suggest renting it for $1.00 or less from a local movie store. It's definitely not a ""watch again and again"" movie."
2,Get it? ... Backwoods?,"I hope beyond all hope, every time I watch this kind of movie, that something new will be brought to the table. Something I haven't seen before, even if it's just a twist ending. However, when you name your movie after a practical horror genre, it can only mean one of two things. You're either sending up the ""inbred redneck"" genre, or you're just adding to the endless list. Backwoods is the latter. The only shred of plot divergence here is that the group of psycho's are living on a former military reservation, and somehow think the land belongs to them. So when a group of fatigue-wearing paintball players comes walking into their ""territory"", naturally, they take offense. This may be new to someone who hasn't seen any of the hillbilly maniac movies, but the plot is almost exactly the same."
5,Good Movie!,"I really loved this movie! Haylie Duff surprised me with her acting abilities when it came to horror. Ryan Merriman is one of my favorite actors (from childhood movies) so to see him play his role great made me happy.I loved the theme of ""Backwoods"" and how it was actually a cult type- of thing.I'm just sad at how they showed this movie once on t.v. and never again. I've been looking online so i can buy the movie and finally they have it up here on Amazon!"
5,Reading Full Moon Feast,"I loved this book. Part memoir, part culinary history, this book explores our increasingly tenuous relationship to the community, healthy eating, and a healthy planet. Jessica's book is in turns educational, heartwarming, and alarming--try eating white sugar after reading about cane sugar production.Great recipes, too."
5,They should re-release this one,"I found this gem at a used book store. Best dollar I ever spent. Milo is a man's man, and it's good to find a tough, cool book in a world of cat crimes and legal thrillers. Milo is the cowboy version of Travis Magee (sp?) except funnier. A drunken, brawling, bawdy, gritty hard-boiled ride."
5,A classic downer,"Take it from the title, ""The Wrong Case,"" is not a happy story. In fact, private detective fiction seldom gets more hardboiled or as down and dirty as this one. Crumley's ""hero,"" the recently unemployed private snoop Milo, is a man shattered by a terrible upbringing and by alcohol. But despite his cynical and distrustful nature, he takes a case he knows will be a loser in a last ditch effort to both redeem himself and to find love. The results are about what you would expect.Milo is a completely different character than Crumley's other private detective hero C.W. Sughrue, the party animal star of ""The Last God Kiss"" among others. Milo has been scarred far deeper by life and fully expects to lose himself to his addictions at some point. His best friends are homeless winos with one foot firmly planted in their graves. Brooding, violent and with a perfectly shocking ending, ""The Wrong Case"" is one of THE great hardboiled detective novels."
5,Join Milo on an amiable wander through Meriwether,"After having read a string of bad thrillers with stereotyped characters and endings that could be seen a mile off this was a breath of fresh air - an amiable amble through the low-lifes and unfortunates of Meriwether, Montana, recounted in a distinctive first-person style by our narrator, the alcohol- and speed-fuelled Milo Milodragovitch, killing time (and a few, more human, bodies) as a, somehwat inept, private-eye until his inheritance comes through. The best feature of the book is that it is character rather than plot-driven - indeed you may find, as I did, that you don't care how it turns out, just being in Milo's company for a few hours is reward enough!"
3,a little musty,"The book arrived on time and from the initial appearance of the text it seemed fine; however, the book was very very dusty and very very musty. I have tried airing it out - I have taken off the jacket and even wiped down the front and back cover with a bleach solution but it still retains the smell. I had to dust the top of the book to remove the thick dust."
3,Seller Satisfaction,"When I first purchased this item, I was very upset because the company that produced the DVDs was Chinese; their English subtitles used the Chinese version (instead of the Korean) of the characters' names and there were many grammatical and idiomatic errors, so I contacted the seller. The seller was very courteous and understanding and did his/her best to accommodate my desires."
3,Quick but low quality shipping.,"While the whole process was quick, and delivery was speedy, my cd came with it's case broken. The cd case is unusable now, and the packaging it came in was not proper for shipping a semi-fragile item. There was no padding."
2,waste of money !,"About 20 bands in the US, like this one, sound exactly the same!Skeleton's only great song is ""Murder Is [wanking]"", everything else is mediocre. Save the money for something else, cuz this one here ain't worth it! I recommend: Slipknot, Disturbed, System Of A Down, Static X, Mudvayne and Sepultura"
3,Good music but Politics and Music Dont Mix,"Nothingface has talent. This is a great album. The only problem I have is when good bands mix politics with music. When I listen to music I dont like to hear politics...The antiamerican message really turned me off. Politics, Religion and Music do not mix!!! I dont care if its right wing P.O.D./Soulfly or left wing Nothingface/new Pearl Jam & Incubus/System of a Down just give me some raw emotion."
4,A nice surprise,"I bought this CD without ever hearing of the band (I liked the cover). Traditionally I am into your straight forward metal bands like Pantera (the best ever!!) Metallica (before the black album)and Slayer along with several new bands especially Hatebreed and Shadows Fall. So as you can guess by my four star rating this album somehow impressed me. This band combines everything that is good about ""nu-metal"" with some traditional elements to make a very strong statement. Songs like ""I Wish I was a Communist"" and ""Here Come the Butchers"" will leave even the most dedicated headbangers wanting more, while other songs like ""Patricide"" and ""Beneath"" will have Mudvayne and other ""nu-metal"" fans banging their heads as well. Something about Matt Holt's vocals or the intensity in his lyrics set this band apart from the others. Either way it definitely grabbed the attention of this die-hard metalhead. So if you have $15 check it out... I did and it has rarely left my CD player since."
1,Garth Brooks from Tulsa to the Top,"This was not a video promoting Garth Brooks. Instead it seemed to have the soul purpose of promoting a book called The Road Out Of Sante Fe. (Which I have also read.) They constantly go back to the one who wrote the book and has it beside him, behind him and any where else he can place the book. It is not a look at Garth Brooks as a person in country music. It shows him very little throughout the movie. I am an avid buyer of anything having Garth Brooks in it on the market today. To me as a fan I wish I had spent my money on something else besides this movie. Oh yeah and by the way I wouldn't have read the book if it wasn't free for the reading at the library. As for the other videos you have listed for Garth, I would highly recommend them for the true Garth fans but please spend your money on them and not this one!"
3,Very Interesting,"Well organized. Very interesting. A bit tedious to work through, but the only way to grasp the development of thought that led to so many Universalist churches being built across Vermont. Reading these historic letters actually helps a person understand the current spiritual climate in Vermont."
4,"Cheap, works; strong butyl rubber smell, thin cable.","I bought this cable in order to be able to run longer cable runs on stage. It works for that. It's a narrower gauge of wire than some of my other cables, and that makes me a little cagy about its durability. I tend to use it for cable runs where I don't expect a lot of movement (e.g., running a cable to a mic stand) and save my better cables for the belt pack mics.The jacket on the cable has a very pronounced butyl rubber smell, and it really activated my allergies at first. I stored the mic cables in an open cardboard box for a few months before using them, and that seemed to help a lot with the rubber smell. Not everyone has allergies, so this might not be an issue for all folks--but I couldn't use these cables for anything near my face for the first few months.They're cheap and they work fine. I haven't noticed any sound issues at all."
1,Awful cables,I have barely used these cables for Mics in a garage band set up. All 3 cables have now gone bad due to the wires losing connection in the rubber boot at the end of the cable that connected to the Mics.I would not recommend these at all.
5,A Must have Book,"Best Book on Hermit Crab care on the market.Another great addition to the outstanding AVS line. Philippe De Vosjoli presents current information , covering all aspects of Hermit Crab care."
3,Lacks a lot,"This book lacks a lot of important information but it is pretty old. I like Hermit Crabs for Dummies much better. The book does have some good info too. Pretty thin book, fast read. It is worthy of purchase but not the only book you should have on hermit crab care."
2,Disappointed,"I was very excited to find this Chucky Set my son has been wanting one for a while. But upon receiving my package and viewing it I was very disappointed. My son planned on collecting them never opening it, and the packaging is damaged and ripped on the box that holds the dolls."
5,Great for curly hair,"This is a great all natural product for curly hair. My hair gets tangled when it is wet. After I spray this on it, the comb goes right through it."
4,For the WW II buff,"I am real happy with this buy. I bought in the used categoryand they came new in a tin. Two disc with 283 min. of viewing.If you are a WW II buff, you will enjoy these disc and if youget them as cheap as I got mine you will be overjoyed. I amvery pleased with this purchase."
4,"love love love my le creuset, BUT....","I don't think anyone can doubt that Le Creuset makes extremely high quality products. However, the only item in this kit that comes with a lid is the french oven. I don't necessarily need one with the iron skillet or the non-stick omelette pan (shown on amazon as enameled but arrives nonstick...also listed as an omelette 'cover' in the description), but I do not understand why a saucepan doesn't come with a lid. I'm not even sure I can buy a lid to fit it now. Seems like all of the french ovens or stock pots or soup pots come with lids, but in my quick browse through this area of the site, I don't see saucepans with lids! I didn't think it would bother me when I got the kit, but I haven't been able to retire the junky old saucepans, since they have lids and can be used easily for steaming vegetables or rice or other lid-necessary dishes! I'm still on the hunt for the lid to match!"
3,Remastered?,"OK this album came out in 1987 and with multiple re-releases. This album is remastered...WRONG it's not. I compared all the ""Remastered"" versions [About 3 cds] and the only one that sounds awesome is not even a full album release it's the compilation album ""25 Years Of Anarchy & Chaos"", now granted only a couple of songs from DBD are present on the CD but it blows away all the so called ""Remastered"" versions. I know what you're saying while reading this, ""It's punk rock who cares what it sounds like -Bull!! I don't know why the Exploited or Wattie allow this to happen. Now don't let this review of it sway you away- get it. It's more Metal sounding than their previous releases [after Horror Epics] and they've remained with the metal sound. Get the cd anyways cause it's good, not they're best, but good. Just don't expect it to sound like other remastered releases."
4,VERY AGRESSIVE,"An experimental thrashcore crossover album.Very lenghty,(67minutes)includes 2 12''EPs.The mix and sound qualityare somewhat poor,never been remastered like the olderalbums.This,together with Horror Epicsare the lesspopular albums,although fans of the band will find it a musthave for the sake of completion.Artwork is great both onbooklet and CD.With the right amount of signal processing-a lot by the way-GREAT music comes to the surface of an otherwise dulland muddy recording.The Jesus Is Deadand War Noweps are nothing short of memorable.Only thing that prevents this recording from getting 5 stars is sound quality.I will buythis yet again when a remastered version comes out andput the older CD in a frame on the wall.I LOVE THIS STUFF,LONG LIVE THE EXPLOITED !!!!!!"
3,NOT THE BEST OF RELEASES,"I THOUGHT THIS ALBUM WAS OVERALL DISSAPPOINTING AT THE TIME IT WAS FIRST RELEASED.BUT I CONTINUALLY LISTENED TO IT OVER AN OVER AGAIN TIL'EVENTUALLY IT WASN'T ALL BAD. THE BEST SONG IS ""POLICE INFORMER""."
5,"A ""must"" for every traveling cigar smoker","I am a frequent traveller for business and I have to say this is an invaluable addition to my travel accessories. Regular lighters and matches just don't cut it for cigars. Now I can being my butane jet cigar lighter with me on business trips and vacation, allowing me to truly enjoy a good cigar at my destination."
3,Umm not sure !!!,"NOWHERE DID IT STATE HOW BIG THIS THING REALLY IS !!!!Seriously !! I DID NOT expect it to be the size of a beer can( almost ! ) !!Wish I would have read ALL the reviews because It does say in the D.O.T report that it expires in March 2012 as another reviewer stated.It all says that this thing was accepted for checked baggage but I think for carry on it will still be O.K. Hope I am not wrong or I just blew about 20 bucks to not take my lighter with me.The unit itself is pretty tough though and I know I can find alternate uses for it.Also: ALL the stickers that WERE on it were just hanging outin the bag.So it was old or it was stored somewhere VERY HOT!It really SHOULD STATE SOMEWHERE(seller,site or on the unit that it did expire........Just sayin...."
1,Mafia Enforcer,This book was purchased for someone else. I did not read it but the person I bought it for had started it at one place but unable to find it again. He liked what he had read and asked if I could find a copy.
2,I don't really like the lyrics in this one,"All of the other albums made by Helios are all instrumental based, this one he decided to make it lyrically based. I really don't like the lyrics in it at all, and I don't think the instrumentals are nearly as good as the other one's; it's like he just put lyrics in place of good instrumentals. Nothing too dynamic in this album either, the only song that stood out in it for me was ""In Heaven"", but that's mostly just because I remember the song they are covering from the movie Eraserhead. The rest of them all kind of sounded the same to me.I'm sure plenty of people will still like it, just make sure you preview it before you listen. I didn't do this because I figured it would be along the same lines of his other albums, and I was disappointed."
2,Does not last long,Bought one on October of 2008. It lasted 2 and half years. It does not withhold the air pressure which make it useless.
1,Good idea but poor design,"In 2011 we purchased 3 Bean Vac Coffee Canisters, one of which was very quickly replaced by Amazon.com when it arrived with the vacuum not working. Now all 3 have stopped working properly, none of them will make a seal, 1 works very occasionally the other 2 not at all. These canisters are expensive and if they had continued to work correctly we would have thought the money well spent.They were a good idea but a poor design.Cannot recommend this product"
4,Finger crossed,"I've held off writing a review, waiting until the first blush of enthusiasm had passed. This IS a very cool idea: automatic vacuum protection for coffee beans. But can it really work at this kind of price-point? That was the question.I've had the canister for a couple of months and -- so far -- all is well! It keeps a good, tight seal and I've had no problems. It does startle the occasional visitor to my kitchen. It's pumping sound is unusual enough to make someone wonder.I keep as many as 5 pounds of different coffees on hand at a time. If the canister keeps working well, I expect to buy at least one more unit."
1,Nothing exceptional about this Coffee Vac,"I bought three of these coffee vaccums. One for myself and two as gifts for my daughters.I was really excited about this product. I love coffee and felt this was a great way tokeep the coffee beans fresh. All three vaccums stopped working within six months.I had read other reviews about the batteries running down quickly, that was not our problem,even when I put fresh batteries in, the canister would not hold the vaccum for more than a few hours.I would not recommend this product. It was a waste of money. I will look out there for something thatworks consistently."
1,Coffee Lover,"The canister worked as advertised for the first few months but recently I've found you have to push down on the lid while the pump is on or it will not work. I've tried calling and e-mailing the manufacturer to see if I can get it fixed or replaced but they have not returned my messages.With no support from the manufacturer and the units poor reliability, I can not recommend this product."
1,Not worth it for the reason it's advertised.,Mine worked for a week and then it started losing the vacuum seal after about one minute after pumping shut off. Cleaned everything and still doesn't hold a seal. I like the canister size and it will keep coffee fresher if the vacuum seal pump is not used if it doesn't hold the seal because you will be inducing air into the coffee every time it pumps down. I took the batteries out and now I just use it as a regular coffee canister. Disappointed that it stop working right out of the box.
1,junk,didn't work for me. no vacuume. too much trouble to return wasted money. it's back in the box i'll give it away
4,Works very well,I bought it to replace one that had lasted about two years. I hope I have better luck with this one.
1,Batteries Need Frequent Replacing,"When the bean vac functions it does a decent job removing air from the canister. The natural oils on the coffee beans are visible and don't dry out as quickly...so long as the vac actually functions.This bean vac has a serious design flaw: The batteries require replacing weekly or twice a week. Whether the vacuum is set to reseal every 48hrs or 12hrs, the batteries need constant replacing. I've switched to rechargeable batteries and its not worth the additional effort. This is a poorly designed product and I zealously discourage readers from purchasing it."
4,Great for Bean Storage,"This is a great item to store whole bean coffee and keep it fresh. This canister I bought as a gift for my daughter, but it didn't work properly when it arrived. I called Exceptional Design and they immediately shipped out a replacement and didn't even ask to ship the originaly back. I've own one for over 5 years and have not had any problems."
4,Great idea & almost great unit,"I purchased two of these about 1 month ago, one was for a gift and the second for myself. After reading all the reviews, the only problem talked about was the POSSIBLE trouble with batteries. So, I found a small wall type plug in transformer (6vdc) and took about 3 minutes to solderto the unit.......bingo........no POSSIBLE troubles. (You can find the transformers on Amazon). There was a problem with one unit, it would run but would not shut off, or would run , stop for a second, and continue. I called the factory and the nice lady told me she thought the trouble was that the ic chip inside was not programmed as it should be....she said they would sent a new unit to me....no charge. The working unit was given to my brother who loves it. The 4 star and not 5, it because of being run by battery."
3,Works well,I got a Bean Vac Battery Operated Vacuum Coffee Canister because of a friend's recommendation. It seems to be working very well.
1,Only works with expensive lithium batteries?,"I just received this as a gift and right out of the box, the unit didn't work with brand new Duracell or Rayovac [regular] batteries. I then tried my Energizer Lithium batteries and voila - the motor kicked on and worked. I'm not going to use this thing if the motor only works with expensive batteries. I've already contacted the manufacturer. I think I got a dud. I'm willing to update my review upon receipt of a new unit.UPDATE 3/9/2012Received a response from Valerie over at the company and this was her response:""Most will work with regular batteries, (not rechargeable). Any electronic device will last longer with lithium batteries, and we do recommend that you use lithium.We suggest using LITHIUM ENERGIZER AA Batteries. It does make a difference. Thank you.""Well then... that's great. The lithium batteries I used lasted a month with the switch in the OFF position? No way I'm spending that much on expensive batteries a month."
4,Great product IF you do the following,Nice to know the beans are staying fresh..nice to hear the air swhoosh out but who wants to replace the batteries every few days because they skimped on the seal which allows air to enter and requires to batteries to activate to recreate the vaccum. I thought the interior cannister might seal better if it were a bit taller so i put about 8 of those small felt furniture pads on the bottom of the cannister and it seems to have done the trick...no batteries dying for a week now.
2,Not very good at doing its job.,"I chose to ignore the numerous warnings people had about this particular product losing its seal, spoiling coffee prematurely.Well, I should have listened because that's exactly what this thing does. Worked fine for about a month, and then all of sudden, every time I look at the thing, the popper would be up indicating that there was air inside, and no vacuum in place.I've tried cleaning the rims of debris, and even placing heavy objects on top of the sealer to help give it a firmer press. Nothing really works past a temporary period, so you can make the safe assumption that this thing doesn't work.There are some other reviews about the unit needing an update to a newer version. I noticed those reviews date back to 2008-2009. I ordered this very recently in 2012, so if this company hasn't addressed these issues by now. I doubt they ever will."
2,There are better alternatives.,I have owned two of these for 7 months now. One of them stopped holding a seal after about a month. The second one just stopped holding a seal also. I have taken the rubber rings out and cleaned both thoroughly. They still won't hole a seal for long. Everyday when I come home I check to see if they are holding and they just don't. I will not purchase these again and I wouldn't recommend them. I have two Vacu Vins coffee saver sets and they work much better and will hold a very tight seal.
2,Had to send it back,"Unfortunately, this item didn't do what it was supposed to. After the first time, the button that is supposed to go down to show that the air has been vacuumed out stopped working. I called the company and they said this happens with grounds and that I should put the grounds in a bag....huh? Thought that was the point of this was that I could put the grounds directly in the canister. They sent me a whole list of things to do for it to work correctly. Bottom line is I think this would work great for beans....not so much for grounds."
5,Cordless coffee can,"GREAT PRODUCT, WHO NEEDS ANOTHER CORD DANGLING ACROSS THE COUNTER, besides my batteries lasted 14 months opening it 2-3 times per day. I am very critical of products and this one is great, coffee freshness lasts 3 times longer than any other method I have used."
5,coffee bean vac,"I received this for Christmas this year and use it every day and have not changed the batteries yet. It works great and I love the vacuum sound as it lets me know my Kona Madame Pele beans are going to be fresh each day. No complaints here, I have no idea what the others problems are. Best unexpected gift I recieved. KMRN"
1,"Good concept, but does not work as decribed","Item worked for first week without any noticeable problems. Days following the vacuum seal started to fail, noticed that seal would only last a couple of hours. Talked to Bean Vac customer support directly and followed recommended fixes with no results.I would not advise purchasing this item until manufacturer can fix (extended) vacuum seal issue."
5,I love Vieuxtemps,"These are wonderful concertos! Don't sound too terribly difficult, none the less they are very beautiful and highly recommended."
5,A Blistering Music-biz Satire....Or A Nearly One Hour Gay-joke? The Choice Is Yours.....,"The P.F.A.C. walks that fine line between clever and stupid, often tumbling over on either side throughout. Five stars alone for the moral, which is that halfwit preverts may be in charge of any given industry (maybe I'm over-thinking that one...). A must for anyone who enjoys a joke at the expense of Fred Durst, R. Kelly, or chai-sipping music execs."
4,"Hilarious, pointed, and insightful satire",This album is a work of genius as it mocks mainstream music conventions. Very witty and very funny. Somewhat brief and not exactly what many would expect from Def Jux but definitely innovative. Well worth picking up for genuine hip-hop connoisseurs.
2,WISH I WOULD HAVE PASSED ON THIS ONE,"I bought this CD knowing I probably wouldn't like it, and I like it less than I thought I would. Half of this album contains stupid skits, and the songs just aren't very funny. The novelty wears off after the 1st couple of listens, the highlights of the album in my opinion are the 3 that Blockhead produced, ""Beer"", ""Back in Da Daiz"", and ""Chapstick""(which is only like 40 seconds long). As MURS says, opinions are like rap careers, everybody's got one, but I honestly think the average 11 year old would find this CD a little childish."
1,Out of date,Don't study this book if you are trying to pass the PMP Exam. It is out of date. Buy Rite's or some other author's book that is compatible with PMBOK 3rd Edition.
2,Excellent explanations but do not take the practice exams,"I passed the PMP exam mostly due to studying from Kim Heldman's book. This book has some excellent explanations of material that is not covered in Kim's book. However, the practice exams in this book are so out of the ordinary that even after just passing the official PMP test, I was still not able to make a passing score doing the practice exams in this book. It seems that the purpose of this book is to make you think your knowledge is so poor that you absolutely must take the author's training course."
3,"Smooth trade; Received item on quickly. However, why the CD missing?","The description on the product is not so correct. It's saying the book is like a new. However, I found it should be around 80% new only. Also, CD missing from the book was also not mentioned."
2,Customer reviews seem staged,Customer reviews for this book seem staged. Notice how everyone recommends this book be read three times. They also have the same average score. I found this book to be average
1,Not suitable and not enough value for self-study,"This book cannot do it alone. Don't you get the impressions that all these rave reviews are fake plants from people who have taken her $1,100 prep course. All these reviews would have you believe that this book alone will get you ready for the exam. This book has enough errors and ommisions so that you'd be folled into thinking you are ready to take the exam when you are not ready to pass it.If you want this book, do youself a favor and take Rita's course where you get this book for free. I'd recommend a better value is that you buy Pete's PMP Cert For Dummies and Kim's PMP Study Guide instead."
1,Obsolete,"Normally, I would give this book 5 stars. But since the book is out of date, and prepares you for an obsolete exam, I give it 1 star. Amazon should list it as ""out of print"". To prepare for the pmp exam, I highly recommend Rita's 5th edition of this book, as it is up to date with what you will be tested on."
4,Very useful + PMBOK must - Passed exam,Yes this book is good. But ONLY in conjunction with PMBOK guide. The Inputs/Tools/Outputs are not that intuitive in Rita's book. I had several questions that I could answer only with PMBOK's knowledge.
4,I passed- so its a great book,"I was very frightened of taking the exam as I did not take any of the 1000+ dollar courses. Instead I ordered this book, got the flash cards and studied for about a month every day. I found this book to be extremely helpful and I passed the first time!"
4,This book was my key to passing the exam,"I used the PMBOK, this book (the ""Rita Book""), PMP for Dummies, and some ESI materials. In the end, I would say that it is this book + the PMBOK that helped me pass the exam the most. The Dummies book and the ESI materials were nice to present a couple of different viewpoints, but Rita's book is the best overview of the exam and provides the best description of what to expect in the exam room itself.I didn't take a prep class. I didn't buy the $250 set of Rita CD's. I read the PMBOK a couple times, read the Rita book twice cover to cover, took a couple of online exams (free ones), went back and reread my weak areas, and went and scored 91% on the test. Don't make a mountain out of a molehill and spend thousands on this exam. Get this book and one or two other materials (just to keep things fresh) and you will be fine."
2,Not as good as others,"I used three books for examp prep, this was the least useful of the bunch. I don't believe I could have passed the exam with only this text or that this study guide affected my score. There are better materials on the web that cost about half as much. Go with the Sybex book. I agree with the other reviewer that the reviews here seem staged."
2,Hard to get passed the arrogance,"I bought this book because it looked like the most read and used book for PMP Certification. To be sure, the book covers plenty of topics and did get me ready for the exam. But, it was harder to get the content out of the book than was necessary. Rita is clearly an expert PMP - and she never let's you forget it. She ""teaches"" by constantly making you feel stupid, and saying things like ""... and you should have no problem with this because I told you to memorize xxx back in chapter yyy"". It would have been nice if she had backed off of the sarcasm a bit and realized that her audience IS stupid as far as PM goes - that's why we bought the book! If I were to do it again, I would have purchased a different book."
2,Too Light,"The coverage of the topics is superficial. If you need to really prepare, take one of the better organized prep courses out there."
4,Good book but not complete!,"A good project manager will take a balanced view of IT, learn the business and gain mastery of software development disciplines. Would recommend that project managers also consider reading books on enterprise architecture."
2,Highly overrated,This book does present some material well. But it is more of an advertising teaser so you'll buy the whole kaboodle paying several hundred dollars. Or worse you'll be motivated to take her course paying thousands of dollars.PMP exam prep has definitely been a growing industry. The certification is by itself overly hyped up. Sometimes it all seems like a scam. One can pass PMP by just reading a bunch of prep books. Just because someone is a PMP doesn't mean a squat.
4,Get it - Don't waste your time elsewhere,"Very good book - get's you 80% there - combine it with the Hot Topics CD and the PMBOK and you should do fine.There are questions and issues that you may have questions on, that is not in the book, but that is no different any course in a box.Get it! It cost Rita the $1200 I was goin got spend on taking her 2 day course."
2,Book is horrible,This book is a rehash of the previous version. It is full of quick tips without much substance. There are many books out there now that are much better. It seems that Rita relies on her inside information with PMI as a selling tool. Will not help you to be a project manager and is more like a boot camp full of things like study this cause it is on the test. lacks comprehension for understanding PMP principles. As a PMP I find these quick books not worthwhille
5,Bible for PMP Aspirants,I recently passed the PMP exam...all credit goes to this excellent book by Rita. I would also recommend practising the tests from PM FastTrack exam simulation software.
2,Old Version,"Caution! The book with the blue cover is the 4th edition of Rita's book. I misread the title, and thought it was Rita's book for the 4th edition of the PMBOK. I bought the wrong book, and I regret it. Frankly, I don't know why Amazon still sells this version. I recommend that you either buy the 6th edition (which Rita actually wrote herself) or the 7th edition which was published post-humously. (Both of these have yellow covers.)"
3,Buyer - PAY ATTENTION,"The book is solid and full of great information - for the 2000 version of PMBOK. This is the 4th version of the Exam Prep book - which has nothing to do with the 4th Edition of the PMBOK Guide. I have been using this as a study aid, but am a little nervous about relying on it since it is a little outdated. If you are looking for an outdated resource - the price is right."
4,Good Examp Prep,i had this book 1 week before my exam and studied this and PMBOK together which gave me best of both the book.both the book have their pros and cons but together they are bestbtw i cleared it first try :-)
4,Good value at the right price.,"I paid $19.00 for this and at that price it was a good deal. It is a fully functional boom mic. stand. I use it with a heavy side address semi pro mic. and it does just fine. I doubt it can take much abuse, or even hard use but if your just going to hold a mic in your music room this will work well."
2,Essays Miss the essence of Soren K.,"The essays can be helpful in understanding some of K's works, but the pervasive ignoring of the spiritual/religious aspects of K's works individually and taken all together makes the book incomplete and totally unsatisfactory. The secularists who write and edit this kind of collection of essays just can't get beyond their own prejudices. Most essays are difficult to read because of poor writing and a failure to really look and analyze what K. is saying. Also, the selection of topics are arbitrary, and I am sure most of the writers wish K. had only written Either/Or and perhaps Stages on Life's way. Please do what K. would want you to do: read his works and ignore the intellectual blather in this book which he would have despised."
4,Nuevas Lecturas (Spanish Language Hardcover),"Description from the book introduction:This text, intended for intermediate students in colleges and high schools, consists of highly diversified reading material. In it will be found anecdotes, folklore, and mystery stories, as well as ten essays which deal with the historical, political and social background of Hispanic Ameria. Most of the material, original in part and in part freely adapted from outstanding writers of Hispanic America and Spain, has not been available before in a reading text."
2,Not the best...,"After the knock-down, drag-out, rippin, lesser-band-killing CDs ""Wonder What's Next"" and ""This Type of Thinking"" I expected, and hoped for, a lot more in ""Vena Sera"". Their newest just doesn't seem to have either the hooks or the punch of previous efforts, and almost feels glossed over in a way. Their sound is less raw (one of the things that makes this band great), sounds more produced, and just plain isn't interesting. Insane drums and massive, crunching guitars have been replaced with nigh hollywood-like pablem, more remniscient of Disney than Chevelle. Even the vocals just aren't up to par with previous efforts. All this said, there are some rocking songs to be found here and there. But on the whole I just can't give this album my entire recommendation."
2,Major disappointment,"Overheard at a meeting of the new Chevelle: ""We've made some great records in the past. We have a distinct sound, and we have built a strong, loyal following. With the addition of a new bassist, we need to change direction. We need to make a record that sounds like everything else on 'rock' radio today. Sure we'll alienate a lot of our fans, but we should be tired of being unique. We just want to fit in.""In the words of GWB, ""mission accomplished."" This isn't a good record. It truly sounds like the rest of the pap on radio today - from the vocals to the music. All of the previous Chevelle records still receive regular rotation in my cd player. This one will not. What the heck happened?"
4,Chevelle Returns To Form (With Some Bad Friends),"First of all, let me say that this album is a HUGE turn for the better from ""This Type of Thinking Could Do Us In."" It is edgier, mixed more professionally, deeper and flat out brilliant. Usually and album this good is a straight 5 for me, but I feel I need to dock a star for the song ""Humanoid."" I know Chevelle is hard rock and sometimes sing of angry things... but this song is flat out hostile. The f-word was SO unneeded and I think Chevelle should take flak for alienating their more conservative fans.That being said, GREAT album! (Remember you can always self-edit or delete ""Humanoid"" all together!)"
2,"Derivative, boring","This is basically catchy radio-rock that's not catchy. Nothing about this album will offend, and nothing will inspire."
3,Medicore at Best,Chevelle has been one of my favorite bands for a long time. The video for MIA hooked me and I've been a fan ever since. I've been to multiple shows and can say that they are one of the best live rock bands out there right now.Vena Sera is their weakest album to date. Each album has progressed in some way or another and this one has to a certain extent. REMEMBER: This is a three piece band so by default they will not sound as full as most bands. Pete Leoffler's performance is noteworthy simply because he is able to fly up and down a guitar while singing at the same time. Not many three piece (typically three cord) bands can say that.A decent album but it left a sour taste in my mouth. I regret spending $14 on the album when I could have simply gotten the single for $0.99. The majority of the album is forgetable. Vena Sera simply doesn't have that Chevelle vibe that radiated from all of their previous work.Save your $15 and put it towards seeing them live. You'll be happy you did.
3,"Chevelle, what happened","I'm a huge Chevelle fan, I've seen them live about 6 times. Being such a huge fan, it's very hard for me to say this, but, I was kind of bored with this. I'm not saying there aren't any good songs, but, I'm pretty disappointed that instead of stepping it up a notch, they stayed at the same notch for the past 2 albums. I love you Chevelle, but, where's the rockin out that I love you for."
3,"3-1/2 stars -- Not quite as strong as previous efforts, but still good","It seems that I'm one of the only people that enjoyed Chevelle's third album This Type of Thinking (Could Do Us In). And apparently something DID do the Loeffler brothers in -- well, at least bassist Pete, who was traded for brother-in-law Dean Bernandini for the band's fourth album, Vena Sera.Musically, there really aren't any bad songs on here, although I don't find myself listening to ""The Fad"" all that much. The best song in my opinion would have to be ""Saferwaters"", but ""Straight Jacket Fashion"", ""Saturdays"" and ""Paint the Seconds"" are also stellar. Everything else on the album is okay, so pick it up if you're a fan.Anthony Rupert"
5,Great rock album!!!!,"This is, IMHO, Chevelle's best yet. Good old fashioned hard rock. ""Antisaint"", ""Straight Jacket Fashion"" & ""Humanoid"" are strong songs definately worth cranking up in the car or on your MP3 player.I've read some reviews that state that this album sounds the same as their others. I wouldn't say it's the same but, yes, it is similar. After all, it is the same 3 guys that started the band. I like it and wouldn't change anything."
4,Chevelle cruises some new terrain,"The Amazon.com reviewer, in what has become classic inside-baseball music reviewer style, puts down another band that first came to life on a ""Christian"" label [Steve Taylor's Squint Records], and because its vocalist reminds you of a vocalist in the ""secular"" market, ""It's A Ripoff And It's Not That Good."" [See: Chevelle vs. Tool, formerly Creed vs. Pearl Jam and even dc Talk vs. U2.] In truth, this album is quite experimental in a number of places and doesn't appear to qualify as the same old Chevelle...except for those crunching guitars and throbbing bass sonics typifying the ""solid"" sound that, as the reviewer grudgingly admits, Chevelle seems to deliver on every CD. As usual with Chevelle, you'll probably hate half the tracks, love the other half, and as another reviewer noted, that kind of hit ratio is a lot better than most bands have been posting for decades. Enjoy."
5,Awesome!!!,"I own every album that Chevelle has put out, and this album is by far my favorite. They took a whole new approch to making this album, which gives it a variety of different sounds. This is a must buy!"
5,Powerful Album,"I've never been a big Chevelle fan, but this album might change all that! Vena Sera is a brutal and visceral masterpiece. There is no flash or grandiose musical posturing. The music just is, and kicks you right in the face.(In that respect, it reminds me of Skillet's album ""Collide"")The vocals blend perfectly with the music. There is a lot of emotion behind the screams and the music makes you feel what the singer is singing about.I'm going to have to check out Chevelle's back catalog to see if their past efforts can match this new disc."
3,not the chevelle I know,"I thought that the cd was dissapointing overall. I love chevelle, and there one of my favorite bands. But they didn't come close to the previous two cd's."
2,Medio-core,"I have been a fan since their first album. I love the first album, wasn't a big fan of Wonder Whats Next and, again, loved This Type of Thinking...So, I guess what I'm trying to say is, I like every other Chevelle album that comes out. This one seems comletely uninspired. I can't wait until the next one. Based on history, it should be good."
4,Awesome CD!!!,Deffinitely The Best Chevelle CD So Far! Almost Every Song On This CD Is Awesome.I Think That 6 Songs Really Stand Out On This Album.I Would Deffinitely Go Out & Purchase This Album!*Brainiac*Well Enough Alone*Straight Jacket Fashion*The Fad*Paint The Seconds*I Get It
4,Descent album,"It's got that classic chevelle sound we all love, with a bit of a twist since the arrival of a new bass player. A few very good songs, and the rest are descent."
5,Vena Sera,I have purchased past titles from Chevelle but have to say this album is the best. This particular artist and album is so great that you can actually listen from start to finish and enjoy each track. Very Very good
5,Another Masterpiece from Chevelle,"Perfect album... Nearly every song on this album deserves five stars. Every album gets better with these guys. If you liked their previous albums, you will like this one too."
3,"well, well... well!","First of I have to say I am a Chevelle fan, know them since their ""Wonder what's next"".What I want to know is, where are the songs that surprise me? ""Wonder what's next"" and ""this type of thinking..."" even ""Point #1"" had those songs, that didn't really grab me with the first listening but slowly grew on me and finally made me addicted.All I can say is, Vena Sera didn't leave as much of an impression on me as their two previous albums did.my favourites are:-the fad-SaturdaysEdit:I can't change the number of stars I gave this Album.What I want to say though is, the same thing that happened before, happened again. This Album needed lots of time to grab me.Right now I would give this Album 5 stars because it absolutely rocks!!I hear it over and over again. Very nice!"
4,I love this band.,"This band isn't the best band in the world to hear live, but their not the worst either.But anyway, Chevelle's new album isn't as good as 2005's This Type of Thinking Could Do Us In but it is probably equal to 2002's Wonder What's Next. A definite buy for fans of Chevelle. You might want to take a second guess if you didn't like This Type of Thinking Could Do Us In because this album sounds almost like it is just a bunch of leftover songs from when they recorded that album."
4,Just what you'd expect...and that's a good thing.,"Of course it sounds like their previous releases...duh... this is Chevelle's sound. I like it. I think I'd be disappointed if it sounded like NIN or something else. If I want NIN, I'll listen to NIN. If I want Chevelle I'll listen to this. One of their better offerings. Is it ground breaking music? No. Do I find myself listening to it often? Yes. Good solid riffs, in your face Rock n Roll."
3,Ehh,"Loved these Chi-town guys' last two records to death. This one has some of the same elements, but things have changed. And I can't tell what. But for some reason, the number of catchy, memorable songs has seriously decreased. The album has strong points, but a couple more weak ones."
5,good product for students,"I use it to write notes in class that are sent to my handheld. Then at the end of the semester, I throw away all the paper and I can keep electronic versions of my notes. The down side is that after I fill up half a page of paper it runs out of memory and i need to get out another sheet of paper. Bleh. Maybe it's just a Treo thing. It is good for my classes where the teacher requires hand written notes."
3,And your point is?,"It is easy to set up and use. It's clever and portable. I am only using it on pc's and laptops, not pda's. My work requires that I take copious notes on the telephone. My hope was that once my notes were digitized (which it does pretty well) I would be able to use a handwriting recognition program on them and load them into Word (where I could then search for links between my customers). Not an option so far, none of the handwriting programs I found could read the files created by Inklink and translate cursive writing into anything but spaghetti. XP has Handwriting recognition, but I only have Windows 2000. Bottom line, it doesn't do very much that you can't do with a crayon and a scanner, they desperately need to intergrate some kind of recognition program into the mix."
2,Nonplussed.,"This product does everything advertised. I just wish it came with functional recognition software. It's not enough to be able to e-mail jpgs of my notes to someone else; I need my notes reliably converted into text.As another reviewer so eloquently put it, this is nothing that can't be accomplished with a crayon and a scanner. The ""Ooh and Ahh"" factor of watching one's handwriting pop up on the screen isn't worth $.If you want a way to get pictures of your handwriting from point A to point B, stick with your fax machine for now."
2,Viking C01694 1GB PC133 ECC DIMM Memory Kit,"I had to return this memory kit twice - finally for a refund. The first time I ordered this kit was in February and it included two DIMMS. That was expected.For these recent orders, only one DIMM was provided.The Amazon Customer Service person indictated that a stock-pulling problem might exist and would contact me when the problem was discovered. I have returned for refund and have recieved the refund.I will search for another solution..."
1,"Sorry, but I couldn't finish it.","I liked the first couple books of this series, but by the time I got to this one, I'd had enough. This felt like a romance novel with fantasy trappings more than a fantasy novel to me. Blech.It was rushed, stilted, and didn't engage me in the least, which is sad -- the concepts of the world are pretty decent.Fortunately, I had the latest Guy Gavriel Kay novel awaiting me, so I dumped this one about 2/3 of the way through."
1,Big waste of time and money.,"This was the most boring book I have ever tried to read. Magic gets explained over and over in almost every chapter. The author described everything in so much detail, the whole plot is lost. I couldn't even finish this thing, about half-way into it I realized I didn't care about any of the characters and already knew everything that was going to happen. Don't waste your money on this crappy excuse for fantasy."
4,Great Read,"It's not often that I read devotional books. However, when the opportunity presented itself to review Voices of Faithful by Beth Moore I jumped at the chance. Each day, the reader is presented with a scripture verse, a short account from a missionary, and a simple prayer. The book is divided up by date, with each month following a common theme such as God's Word, Prayer, Contentment, Spiritual Warfare, and God Before Me . Each month has a forward by Moore discussing these themes.Although, I would have like to see more entries from Beth Moore - the book was filled with stories of hope. The layout is perfect and the pages are very soft and tender - very different from most books.Would I recommend it to read: If you never read another devotional - you should definitely read this one!"
5,Lots to think about,"The coolest thing about this devotional book is that each month is themed on a different aspect of God. For example, January is God's Character; June is Persecution and December is Christmas Around the World. The reason I like this is because some devotional books feel like they skip around and are hit-and-miss on topics. I love that this one devotes more than three or four pages to a topic.Even the introduction, by Beth Moore, is impressive and really makes you think about missions. She also wrote an intro into each month. The devotions themselves are written by those who are out doing the work of God. It's interesting to see what they write and to try to read it in the context of what they deal with on a daily basis.I think this would be a good gift for a missions teacher, a student studying to be a missionary or even a church mission leader.I received a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review from Book Sneeze."
4,voices of the faithful,"I recently received a copy of ""Voices of the faithful"". This is a devotional book with devotions for every day of the year. The devotions are compiled by many different Christians all over the world. Each month has a specific theme, and all the stories relate to that theme. Each devotional starts with a scripture that pertains to the story. The person's name, who is telling the story, is at the bottom. As well as what part of the country they live in. At the end is a prayer that connects with the devotional. Overall being my first devotional book I thought it was really good. And I would highly recommend it."
4,Inspirational Devotional about those stepping out on their faith,"I did enjoy reading through this devotional, especially when I'm in a season of life where I feel a desire to begin serving in international mission trips. This is a great example and filled with stories of women trusting the Lord and being obedient to Him! (I received this as part of the Thomas Nelson Publishing Book Sneeze Review Program)"
1,sucks,This gun sucks it broke the second day i had it and the clip didn't load when i shook it like they said dont ever buy this gun
1,Horrible!,god this was the worst gun you can ever buy! its all plastic! and shoots 230 fps. clip holds like 50 bbs. battery sucks as well just seriously you will be disapointed when you buy it
3,"Honestly, I haven't heard the comp. yet, BUT...","I haven't heard the comp. yet, but I have heard the two Unsound songs that are on it, and that's the sole reason for me to purchase it, which I'm about to do...Definite traces of emo, as well as yer standard metalcore, but with the ability to stand out. I'm a terrible critic, so I'll shut up now."
5,Good cable,Good price and good cable. It turned out a little short for my application so I bought another one a bit longer.
4,great stove,"I bought my Bosch stove about 3 years ago and have had no problems with it. I especially like the dehydrate feature. I tend to bake a lot (cookies, cakes, pies, etc) and so the oven has been used heavily. Lately I've noticed that cookies don't brown evenly, but I can have an appliance person look at that. Doesn't affect the ultimate product, so am not too concerned just yet! Thought I would use the convection component more than I do, I haven't experimented with it very much."
2,Use as a monitor,Sound quality is below average. I use two of these as floor monitors and thats what they are good for.
2,Good price/value ratio,"Monitors have a good bass and reproducehigh's fairly well if you have enoughamp driving them, but do not come thruwell in the critical voice range."
4,Great for Tarantulas!,"Love this container - perfect size for smaller tarantulas and other arachnids, plenty of room for substrate and easy to access. Recommended!"
1,Didn't ship complete,"The product was what I thought, but it didn't come with the flip lid for the top. Made me wondering if the description said it didn't come with the lid because the price was so good. Nope, looked it up and the product description states it includes the lid and the ""Packaging Contents"" of the product itself said it comes with a viewable lid. Disappointed because I either need to wait 2+ weeks for a replacement one, or make my own lid which is what I'm doing."
5,LET'S BE FAIR TO EVERYONE,"I USE THIS BOOK FOR MY TRADE AS AN ADA CONSULTANT AND HAVE FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE THE BEST RESOURSE THAT I COULD HAVE. THE MAIN OBJECTION IN ADA COMPLIANCE IS NOT ONLY TO CONDUCT A COMPLETE SURVEY BUT ALSO TO UNDERSTAND THE INTENT BEHIND THE LAW, THIS BOOK DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB OF RELAYING THE INTENT. I RECOMMAND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE WHO IS INVOLVED IN MAKING A BUILDING ACCESSIBLE TO THE DISABLED PUBLIC."
4,A First,I have been a fan since i first heard Travis;Ilook forward to anything new that he puts out; I liked the song very much and i am looking forward to the cd comming out. It seems like a long time since we had something new. I really like Travis when he sings songs with a fast tempo; but he does a wonderful job on a love song; and that is what this one is.Keep the music comming.
5,Different albums; both great.,"The song ""Discipline"" from King Crimson is probably the best thing to compare Triskaidekaphobie to. Highly complex and repetitive, with prolonged, subtle crescendos and a general sense of barely restrained tension. Drives co-workers crazy after a while. La Poison Qui Rend Fou contains one of the best vocal lines I've ever heard on its first track. Unlike Triskaidekaphobie, this album has something that, at least very distantly, approaches funk. More of a sinuous thing than the crystalline precision of Triskaidekaphobie."
3,Appendix to Dirr's Manual of Woody Landscape Plants,"Even though I am glad to have these photos to accompany one of the most important books in horticulture today, I consider this book disappointing.The photos are all black & white, often with poor quality printing so that I found it difficult to see what the picture was showing. Also, even though the photo manual is arranged in much the same way as the text manual (alphabetical order of scientific name), I would have appreciated referral page numbers to the original text manual.For good photos get Dirr's Hardy Trees & Shrubs. It is in full color with excellent photos -- top quality in everyway."
2,Series Withering on the Vine,"I've been growing less and less enchanted with the series as it goes along. This continues its decline.Initially, the spectre haunting Rutledge held me fascinated.Was the Rutledge nuts or haunted? However, as the series continues we get no deeper into Rutledge resolving his psychological conflicts. (It would have been better, if he was just haunted.) I assume he's going to have to visit every county in Britain, Scotland, and Ireland (at one book each) before its resolved.Also, this book continues the author's recent perchant for making the least credible character to be the murderer."
4,Great series,"I love this series. The language, the historical accuracy, and a battle-disabled hero with ""shell shock"", a malady that made it's first wide-spread appearance after WWI. Amazing."
2,nice looking but poor locks that they open & loose it.,"I liked it but after wearing it , I lost one for poor lock that I kept my eye on it but I lost it."
5,A Beautiful Portrait of Diana&#65533;s Early Years,"This is a beautiful full color picture book that gives many pages of respectable information that focuses on Diana, Charles and their two precious children, when they were small.It covers Diana and Charles' activities, hobbies, trips, adventures, and their life being the parents of William and Harry when they were small.I bought this book in 1987, and it has held up beautifully. You can see Diana coming into her own, as well as her devotion to her husband and children. From pony rides to speaking engagements, charitable work, and life both at home and abroad, you will find a most beautiful portrayal in this book.Highly recommended as a treasure for your library."
3,Nice looking but doesn't stay on wall,Got this with several other stick on posters from the same manufacturer for my son's room. These were the only posters that would not stay on the wall. One would fall down daily and the other would peel on the corners. I noticed that the plastic on these were more shinier and stiffer that the other posters so that could be an issue with the lack of adhesiveness. I mentioned the problem to Amazon and they were great in sending me replacements and letting me return these for free. Love shopping through the Amazon store for this type of problem. No delay in response. Hopefully I had a bad batch the first time and the replacements stay on the wall.
4,deep dish heaven,"Just got this. Looks good, nice large pan for a serious chicago deep-dish pizza. Looks like stainless steel, thick, probably sturdy (in fact you could run it over with a car) comes with an oily substance that was obviously left over from the manufacturing process so wash it first. Good product for the money."
4,Great pizza pan,"I was very surprised at the quality of this pizza pan. I was happy that it was not a cheap, thin metal like some of the other pans I've seen."
2,Waste of Time!,"Overall the story was okay-it at least kept me interested until the end-only because I was expecting some of my questions (which kept me reading) to be answered. I am more confused now than when I started reading it. I understand that there is a sequel on the way, but I wont read it because I didn't care about the characters and a sequel seems like overkill-she could have easily ended the book.Also, her dialogue is lacking and unbelieveable, and she uses a very irritating form of third person writing. She also needs a decent editor because I am a teacher and I had an overwhelming urge to get out my ""red pen"" and correct the grammatical and spelling errors myself.Don't waste your time."
4,good buy,"The headsets work well and are easy to change from helmet to helmet. I also bought 2 Nady mrc-11x motorcycle communicators. These units have a few problems but work well for the money. The units come with an external ptt button you can mount on your handlebars I had the units replaced once and the external ptt button did not work on all 4 units. It is pretty simple to reach down and hit the ptt button on the unit clipped to your belt. The units do have vox but it is slow to react so it is easier to use the ptt button. The units work both bike to bike and as an intercom, however they do not work very well as both at the same time. When 2 headsets are hooked to the same unit the headsets are in constant communication therefor the wind and engine noise is heard constantly making it difficult to hear if someone from another unit is trying to talk.I would recommend these units to anyone, I think the problems are minor and for the price they work very well."
1,Very Fragile Headsets,"I use these headsets while instructing on open road courses. The wiring is very fragile at both end-points, and I have had to replace the units every single year (Headsets only ... the electronics are just fine.) I am trying to find a headset that works with the unit and is more robust."
2,Cheap wiring and low volume at high speed,The tiny flimsy wires in the cable are not well protected. I have to replace my headsets every year because the wire fails at the end plug. I carry two spares.The volume is not high enough at speeds over 50 MPH. I have to reach up and press the speaker against my ear to hear my passenger. I modifed the mount inside my open face helmet to hold the speaker closer to my ear and to block air entering the helmet. That helped but did not fully resolve the volume issue.
4,testify reveiw,"This is a great single.The first remix of testify is really good, with differant music.The rownena project remix is good.The two live track's are awsome.I have all ther albums but this was still worth getting."
4,Testify,"Darn it! Is it me, or does Rage Against the Machine put out the best singles? I have Battle of LA, and I like Testify and Guerillia Radio. I can only imagine how much money Rage rakes in with these awsome singles. I wish they would just make longer, limited Ep's or something. This is awsome, but Rage should take example of Incubus and make a limited, worthy Ep."
1,Weak effort,"I looked at the book and because Lobo, the Martian Manhunter and Superman were in it I purchased the book assuming that it would be a good story with great fight scenes between the main characters. The book has very little action. It spends much of the time portraying Lobo as a Wolverine rip-off and the Manhunter as a Sap. The first half of the book has no action. Surprisingly (or not with such a week story) there is much inuendo and sexual content which was unexpected because these are characters that teenagers would be interested in. It was truly a waste of money."
4,saw,"the saw works well enough, sometimes the knob gets in the way, but for the most part, an excellant purchase."
1,Look Elsewhere,"If you are looking for a legal reference book, look eleswhere. After purchasing this book expecting a ""legal guide"" I was etremely disapointed. This book is nothing more than a collection of mainly common sense travel tips, most of which are well known to anyone who has traveled a few time. There is no analysis of case law or statutes and the ""legal"" content mainly consists of suggestions to ""see a lawyer"" in certain situations. For example, if you have been discriminated against in air travel, the book suggest you should ""see a lawyer."" If you have any experience in traveling, stay away from this book. Perhaps for a young person going on their first trip, this book maybe helpful. For all others you will be amazed someone could write so much and convey so little useful information."
4,Exactly as advertised and reviewed,"I looked at BestBuy for this cord and they wanted $80. This one works well, was inexpensive and arrived quickly. Per the other reviews it is shorter than the original cord but for the money I am willing to accept that...if, however, where you use your computer requires a longer cord it could be significant for you."
1,Not Worth your Rime,"This looks appealing, but don't bother the item just never worked and if you were in the middle of important work like I was then just move on."
1,Don't buy!,"I ordered this item, and it stopped working after 2 weeks! It started overheating, making noises and then at the end started smoking! The cord material is flimsy, as in not strong enough and easy to bend/break. I should of just ordered one from hp from the start, but hesitated because it was pricey. But i ended up spending more money, because this is a cheap alternative. Which won't last for long! so just save your time and money and buy the hp charger from hp, i got the eco-friendly slim one, it works great!"
3,Works but might not be new...,"They work just fine, and seem to really be original HP issue. But the ones I got were in opened boxes and had clearly been at least uncoiled. I presume, therefore, that they were used, not new. But for the price, I'm not complaining - they work just like new."
4,Got what expected except for....,"Got the correct adapter I needed, but the boxes looked old and looked like they had been opened a lot before. Adapters were in good condition, hope they hold up."
2,Not a Genuine HP Product.,Like others have said on here before this is NOT an HP product. It is a cheap knock off.It is better as it has an LED indicator but other than that it was much worse then my HP Original charger. This charger got much hotter then a true HP charger which indicates to me that it is not as efficient from taking AC to DC conversion very well.Wish chargers would have the 80 Plus standard that most desktops have but they don't. If they did than 80 Plus certified products wouldn't be as warm and you use less energy! I digress...Bottom line: Has an LED indicator. It chargers up your battery but it will get much hotter then a genuine HP product. It may not last as long as a real charger but I have not tested that out.
1,Very Disappointed,"I was very disappointed to find that this ""universal adapter"" was NOT compatible with my laptop, even though the advertisement claims it is. When I tried to return the item because it wasn't compatible, PCUniverse DENIED me. I could'nt be more dissatisfied with my experience. BIG WASTE OF MONEY."
1,One short movie plus lots of archive footage,"The premise about American soldiers missing in action in the Vietnam war still being in Vietnam is an interesting one. But it's not well executed. Not until after watching the movie did I learn that the flashback scenes were archive footage from another movie, (Under Heavy Fire, aka. Going Back). That explains the difference in production values between those scenes and present-day sceness that were actually shot for this movie. The present-day storyline is very thin and seems to be nothing more than a means to connect the flashback scenes, in order to get two movies for the production cost of one and a half. The result is rather incoherent and also quite dull and unsatisfying. Not recommended."
3,Avalon,"The mystical Isle of Avalon, where the Lady of the Lake guards Excalibur and the evil Melwas keeps Guinevere a prisoner underneath the Tor; Nicholas Mann, historian and author, explores its legendary mysteries by examining the physical features of place in the context of its mythology, history, and religious significance. Mann is obviously enthralled with Glastonbury, and while he does a through and creditable job relating the factual evidence, he is also prone to conjecture. Goddesses and druids, magical springs and ley lines, dragons and labyrinths all have their place in this book. But the author generally differentiates clearly between what is known and what is imagined, and this book is recommended to anyone interested in Celtic mythology and ancient religions."
4,Informative and Interesting,"I have not yet finished this book, as it does take awhile to read. It is very informative and has a lot of intersting facts about this Avalon and Glastonbury; however, it can be difficult to read."
4,These guys rock!,"Great mixture of sound throughout the album. And wow, what a bunch of material! They show a wide range of style and dynamics as well. Love the addition of the sax too.....horns always add more depth and interest. In short, definitely worth checking out and purchasing. Hard to find good new music like this these days!"
2,Auto VentShade taillight covers,"Not too impressed. 4 small velcro pieces to hold the shade on. They were not well placed, and not a good fit on my Jeep Liberty."
5,great purchase,these have to be the most comfortable boats I have ever purchased and they are also water proof! but aside from that shipping was very quick and item was well packaged
1,not very inspiring.,"i started reading this book and it so filled with a mishmash of junk, i gave it to the local library for its book sale."
3,A little cheaply made,I purchased two of these mirrors and felt they were pretty cheaply made and easily breakable I have set them up in my car and I don't plan on moving them so they are doing the job.
3,Time to Move On,"This last book in the Amelia Peabody series. TOMB OF THE GOLDEN BIRD, has Emerson ""The father of curses"" watching from the sidelines as Howard Carter and Lord Carnarvon make the discovery of the century with the find of King Tut's tomb.Egypt seethes with politics and wise Amanda knows there are few years left for excavations as the country achieves nationalism. The day of the foreigners working the sites is passing while Amanda and Emerson have grown older.There isn't the suspense of previous titles in this series because we all know how history has written the story, but it is a good read.Nash Black, author of QUALIFYING LAPS."
3,"Better Than a Lot of Product on the Market, But...","I have to confess that I've never been as enamoured of the Amelia Peabody series as most people. However, I've read all of them, & found them enjoyable, if not ones that I buy to add to my own library. (I do, however, own nearly every Elizabeth Peters outside of the Amelia Peabody series.) Tomb of the Golden Bird was well-written & full of interesting historical/political information, and as usual contained a great deal of witty humor. But after 18 titles, I'm tired of hearing about Emerson's ""sapphirine"" eyes, & skeptical that Amelia & Radcliffe are as...um...amorous...as Peters delicately suggests. My biggest beef with Tomb, though, is a factual error: It was not EDWARD II who wanted someone to rid him of ""this turbulent priest"" (aka Thomas ? Becket), but HENRY II. Oops!"
1,Worst of the Amelia series,"I had been looking forward to this book for the last year, as I have always waited with excitment for Peter's books. I felt that this book was a huge let down. Other reviewers have mentioned the ""weak"" mystery, the mystery was so weak, that there wasn't really one. What I've always enjoyed about these books are the daring and sometimes thoughtless escapades the Emerson's are always engaging in. Ramses is one of my all time favorite characters, but now seeing him so absorbed with family life, he's just boring. I hope if Peter's decides to write another Amelia book, it's not focused so much on domestic life. She should work on a new Vicky Bliss book!"
2,"I'm a fan, but this book was disappointing!","Not up to the usual standard, it was slow moving and bogged down a number of times....at the end you wondered what was the point? It lacked plot interest, it just meandered through the story and a lot of plot tie-ins from previous books were not well done. I love the series, but this was a poor effort compared to the others."
4,A story set around the discovery of King Tut's tomb,"In this book we have the Emersons right on the scene when King Tut's tomb was discovered. But they are forced to watch it from the sidelines though because Emerson has managed to make everyone involved upset with him again. But there is lots of other excitement in the lives of the Emersons that we can get caught up in. This book has a really strange group of villains and, of course, Sethos appears to be right in the middle of them. He certainly knows more than what he is letting on, and Amelia is not about to let him get away with that. Things in Egypt are unsettled after the first world war and there are some partisan movements in place to overthrow the British government. The Emersons are of course right in the middle of all this, and it makes for a story that is again hard to put down. I personally cannot wait now until the next installment of the story of this tempestuous family."
4,Tomb of the Golden Bird,"As usual, Elizabeth Peters gives us another fun mystery intermingled with Egyptian culture and archeological methods. However I do miss the young Amelia and Emerson and their romantic and often funny adventures. Always a pleasure to read."
2,Disappointing,"I have read every book in the Amelia Peabody series and was anxiously awaiting this one. The first three-quarters appeared to be painfully written. It wasn't until the last sixth of the book that the quintessential Peters writing style emerged. Given the interwoven tale with the historical events, it could have been more in line with other Peabody novels."
2,Alot of dialog about not much,"The novel Tomb of the Golden Bird by Elizabeth Peters is a long and slow. Frankly, after listening to the entire unabridged version, I am still trying to understand what the plot is all about. This book lacks a conflict or a purpose and resolves nothing at the end.Set in the early 1900's in Egypt during the discovery of the Tomb of King Tut (The Golden Bird), several British characters walk around and talk alot, but, not about much. The ""sub-plot"", the opening of the tomb and the vast collection of treasures contained inside was the most interesting parts of the book, but, again, they were a sub-plot.This is really too bad, it had a great setting with an interesting event to write about, but, just nothing to say. The characters were rather flat and un-interesting. No action, no adventure, no drama, my advise is no read it. This is one you can skip reading."
2,Jumped the shark,"I usually try to be thoughtful and reasoned when doing a review, but this book was just plain bad. This series jumped the shark several books ago, but I keep hoping Peters will realize this and turn the series over to a new generation of characters that *might* be able to breath some new life and new ideas into the plotlines.Alas, this is nothing but a ""clips show"" of old material (Sethos as rogue - we get it! David entangled in Egyptian independence - done! And, PLEASE, no more visions of Abdullah, family Xmas celebrations, councils of war, tea at Shepherd's or Kadija's green goop!) thrown together in hopes of suckering fans of the series into spending money. My advice: if you *have* to read this one, borrow it from the library. I know I won't be purchasing any more books in this series."
1,oh dear!,"This is the first Amelia Peabody mystery I have read and it will definitely be the last. What a bore! The character development seemed stifled, perhaps because of the very large number of them that filled space for no apparent reason. I found no suspense, no mystery, just a vague hope with each turning page that something might improve. Instead this is the first novel which I found myself constantly looking at my watch to see if I had endured enough. I suppose after 17 other stories, the rest of the series must be at least reasonable, but this one has convinced me not to attempt to find out."
5,Great fun!,"A mystery surrounding the discovery of King Tut's tomb, with the usual madcap adventure and convoluted family dynamics. Amelia is wonderful as usual. This book also has one of my favorite secondary characters Sethos, Emerson's rascally half-brother, up to something shady as usual. I am as convinced as ever that Sethos is the great-grandfather of John Smythe/John Tregarth, another of Elizabeth Peters' charming rascals, in the Vicky Bliss books. Hopefully there'll be another Vicky Bliss book one day as well that will reveal that connection."
4,Amelia Peabody rides again!,"This series has always had certain charm as the reader follows the Emerson family and their archeological work from the late 1890s to this current work, set in post World War I Egypt. The charm is still there, as well as Amelia and Emerson's innumerable eccentricities, but as perhaps inevitable with such a long running series, the tension has run out of the story line.The Tomb of the Golden Bird is set against the backdrop of Howard Carter's discovery of King Tut's tomb in the Valley of the Kings. Elizabeth Peters had to put the Emersons on the scene without making them participants to the detriment of the story's dramatic tension. Nevertheless, a fun, pleasant read for anyone who is an Amelia Peabody fan and has been following the Emersons."
1,Buggy Buggy ..... doesn't run in OS X needs classic mode,This product does not run in OS X it only runs in classic mode yet on the order page it makes NO mention of this. I will be returning it. There is no excuse for shipping a product that does not run in the native OS it claims it does.It is also buggy with the audio cutting out between each scene change until you muddle with turning the audio up or down to restore the audio. Shameful.
4,mr cordless,The LeBra is all I excepted. went on fairly easy. looks good and keeps the winter road junk off the front of my car.
1,Short lifetime,The mixer died within a year. The replacement was defective. The third mixer lasted about a year. The company does not let out any service manuals so there's no chance of self repair.
5,Unique Mix of Powerful Sax and Love Themes,"Excellently framed tracks, with powerful beat, especially the seductive sax---yet intriguingly mixed with enlightening religious themes. ""I Had a Dream"" is from the perspective of God lamenting over Mankind, and is quite believable, even frightening. But this is not an overtly religious CD---it's above all an exploration of the nature of Love, both from a Cosmic as well as a close-up, all-the-wrinkles human perspective. ""She's Just Shy"" captures the pent-up emotion of unexpressed love. This is not your run-of-the-mill average CD. It's a rare gem, worth savoring, and listened to over and over."
2,Oddball Covers,"Luka Bloom's previous releases showcase his powerful voice, excellent songwriting abilities and skills with arrangement. While this CD still showcases his voice and arrangement skills, it does nothing for songwriting, as all the songs are covers and most are odd at that.This is a release that even fans of Luka Bloom would not miss if it were not in their collections. It isn't bad, just disappointing. For those unfamiliar with Luka, you would be much better off with the stirring Riverside or uplifiting Salty Heaven."
3,Enjoyable but Lacking in Depth,"If you're looking for some books to pass a rainy weekend or to take on holiday, then by all means pick up the Cleric Quintet. The book has a fast pace that covers for the lack of characterization and emotion involved. Cadderly and the Boulder Shoulder brothers are likable and the minions of Talona are fine enemies. However Mr. Salvatore resorts to the unforgivable cliche of making the protagonist and the antagonist father and son. Fear not, the information won't spoil your read as it adds no dramatic feel. I've said too many negative things here. Let me say a few positive ones. Cadderly's dealings with the dragon were quite well played and avoided the standard ""slay the beast"" device. While many readers disliked the 5th book, saying it had nothing to do with the other four, I liked it very much for the same reason. Sometimes things don't happen in nice packages."
2,Not up to the standard of his others,"Deep character development? A true journey to faith?Perhaps for junior high school students.Perhaps I was oversold by the other reviews, but I found this collection well below par."
4,The cleric quintet,"Salvatore once again delivers big time action, magic, and adventure in this fabulously crafted series. Experienced Salvatore readers wont be dissapointed with the brutal fighting scenes and non-stop action of the cleric quintet. Character development and attachment are trademark Salvatore quality adding to the list of favorite Realms personalities with heroes like the Bouldershoulder brothers and Danica the monk. Salavtore takes full advantage of the shared fantasy genre, exploring and defining new areas of geography and history of the rich tapestry that is the Forgotten Realms. Enjoy!"
3,Interesting but I was expecting more,I give this quintet three stars because although it was an interesting read it lacked the maturity of thought and style that I am used to. The ending really ticked me off and but only partly because it was so sad. The end It didn't seem to fit with the rest of the story. Up to that point the whole thing was light and though the author did try to introduce some conflict it didn't ever feel dark enough to justify such an ending. If any of you have ever read Robin Hobb's assassin trilogy you'll know what I mean. The ending to that series was bittersweet and depressing but the whole thing had been like that so the ending wasn't a surprise. After seeing all the great reviews of this book I was expecting something better. Perhaps I was expecting too much but as it is I am disappointed.
5,Excellent book,"This is another great book by R.A. Salvatore! This details the background of Cadderly and the Bouldershoulder brothers, and gives great depth on their stories."
4,The Cleric Quintet,"Another in a long line of great adventures from R.A.Salvatore. Great read, nice escape. Keep them comming."
3,great ideas but writing style hinders reader's imagination,"in a nutshell, i loved the idea of a priestly order battling an unspeakable evil with knowledge; i was ready to devour the story with pleasure. but i was disappointed with salvatore's portayal of the fight scenes. there is such a thing as being too descriptive: he describes every swing, each turn, each blow with meticulous detail.normally, detail is a plus, providing the reader with the beautiful imagery that makes reading such a pleasure. but somehow, with the fight scenes, i found myself trying to picture every single thing that each opponent was doing. the result was that i could picture nothing at all, and was left with a vague dissatisfaction. it was almost as if i were reading a script...i couldn't FEEL the fight or the action. enough should be left to the reader's imagination, letting him supply the details that his mind perceives.even though i finished the book, i felt as though i ate something without the proper seasoning."
2,much ado about nothing (apologies to Wil),"Such a lot of words to say very little. Long battle scenes, long discussions, long story, weak interest for me. I guess the only thing that I enjoyed was the dragon who had an interesting personality. The bad guys didn't impress me, and the heroes were not overly noteworthy. There are other books out there that I would put way in front of this one. If you are a fan of this author (this books was recommended as a way to sample his writing), read it."
3,"Could be better, boring, but yet entertaining at times",I would only get this book if I really didnt have anything else to read. It was funny at times but extremely boring at others and Cadderly just gets old.
5,Fantasy Fiction at its best,"I may be the only Salvatore reader in the world with this opinion, but I think The Cleric Quintet was better than the Dark Elf trilogy. I have yet to buy this hard bound edition, but the paperbacks were incredible. This is his best attempt at truly developing a character. Cadderly is an epic character through and through. Add a few Star Wars like elements, and some incredible battle sequences, and you have pure good reading."
2,Not exceptional,"Given the reputation of the author - this is the first novel by Salvatore I read - I expected a lot more.""The Cleric Quintet"" is at best average-quality, mass-production fantasy writing, full of cliches, one-dimensioned characters and with a predictable storyline that might be good for a RPG session but is definitely too simple-minded for a novel (series).While I have read worse, I would not buy the book again and am thinking hard whether it is worth giving the Drizzt novels a try..."
3,Cleric Quintet Collectors Edition,"The Cleris Quintet is a nice off-shoot of Salvatores Realms collections this time focusing on Caderly, Danica and the Bouldershoulder brothers. Thoroughly enjoyable! This particular Collectors Edition contains all 5 books rolled into one. The price is exceptional but it is very, very heavy to hold and read. I think I tore my rotator ;)"
2,Top Wing,"My son who is 9, struggles with reading, so some of the vocabulary was a real stretch for him. We use a ""fist"" method, where he counts the words on a page that are too tough, and if he gets the whole fist, the book usually is just that. We were close on many of the pages and though the story was good, as were the messages, this is not a good book for a child who has a ""decoding"" issue. It took almost 10 days for us to get through it. Even his teacher admitted she knew it would be a challenge."
4,How adorable!,"Was concerned that they were not packaged better as they are breakable, but they were just fine.I love the plates and hope they will not chip easily...time will tell. Excellent price!!!!"
1,Disappointed,My daughter purchased this microphone for her karaoke machine. It broke after only a few uses. I contacted customer service and went through the whole process to ship it back for a replacement. We never received a replacement and they claim to have no record of anything. Unfortunately I lost the return number so my daughter is out of luck. Bad product and bad customer service.
3,Works good just not to sturdy.,This mic worked good. I bought it for my girls karaoke machine. The downside is that it broke at the end of the cord where it plugs into the mic. It seems like it could of been made to stand a bit more abuse. But all in all good mic for the price.
1,Wonderful....AT FIRST,"I bought two of these microphones for my karaoke system at home. At first, they were wonderful. The quality was great for the price. But in less than 2 months, both are not working at all. Both have bad wire connection issues. What a waste! I think that most of the positive feedback left here was left before their product gave out."
2,Missing,"I just received this product and it came without the adapter for PC usage. Needless to say, I'm quite upset.i"
1,did not last,"We bought this as a second microphone for a karaoke machine for my son's birthday and within a week it had a lot of static to the sound. Unfortunately I bought it way ahead of time, so by the time he got it and used it, the return window had expired."
1,Broke after 3 weeks,The wire broke away from the microphone after only 3 weeks of use. I would not recommend this produt.
1,Only worked for 10 mins!?,"I thought this would be a good deal becoz a lot of people said it was. However, when i plugged it into my karaoke machine, it only worked for like 15 mins and then stopped working. I am sure it wasn't the problem of my machine, because i could use it with another microphone...but just not this one. Disappointed!! what a waste of money, buying something that wouldn't even work for a longer time, not recommend!! just believe that price = quality, not gonna buy a cheap microphone in the future"
1,Didn't take long,I bought this as the second microphone to go along with my daughter's karaoke machine. In less than a week it no longer worked. Seemed that it never quite had a good connection between the cord and the bottom of the microphone.
2,Loose cable makes teh mic useless.,"This is useless if you are looking at out of the box product. The Cable that plugs into the mic is looses. Someone had complained about it before but I thught it might be just a few that may be faulty, but I happened to be unlucky. Cannot use the Mic unless you buy another cable that would fit into it."
1,Broke after only 1 day of use,"We purchased this Microphone as a Christmas Present. It lasted 1 day before the cable had a short in it. Like always, AMAZON replaced with no hassles. We received an instant Amazon Gift card that we used to replace the mic and ended up going with theBehringer XM8500 Dynamic Cardioid Microphoneand couldn't be happier. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY this microphone. Spend a little extra and go with the Behringer XM8500 and a 10 foot XLR cable. The sound alone is worth the price. I believe the entire setup with Behringer Mic and XLR Cable was approx. $30.00"
3,Solid performer,"I have had this mic for over six months now and have had no issues with it. It is by no means a Shure but for the money, it's a very good buy. It will do the job for announcements that one would make at a wedding, gig, etc. Hard for me to justify paying a hundred bucks for a Shure when this mic will do the job for the majority of my needs"
1,I should have paid attention to the reviews,Neither of the two microphones I ordered for my granddaughters for Christmas worked. Why do people sell things that they must know doesn't work. As many people as reviewed said the cable was messed up. They have to know they are screwed up.
4,No complaints.,"my kids use this with a speaker to do kareokee, they have used it pretty agressively and have had no issues at all."
2,Lasted 3 months,The cable is horrible and cheap. It lasted only about 3 months and then broke. I won't be buying this brand again. We didn't even get to use it all that much.
2,Broke very quickly,"My son got this for Christmas. Less than a month later, the cable can no longer firmly attach to the base, and it's nearly impossible to get a signal out of it. It sounded good for the first couple of weeks he had it. Unfortunately, it now appears to be unusable."
2,Great.......Then terrible,"I bought this microphone for my singing machine. It worked great, and I loved it, and then after 1 month of minimal use, it stopped working. I called Nady and they told me to ship it to them for a replacement, but I had to pay $15 for shipping. I waited a month, and they never sent me a replacement. Finally I called them again, and they said we'll ship the replacement tomorrow. I eventually got it, unfortunately they sent me a refurbished replacement. I used it once or twice, and then it stopped working. My other microphone still worked great with my karaoke machine. I called them today, and they told me they'll ship me another one without me having to ship my old one. They told me that after this one, they can't send me any other replacements. Nady's quality of their products is TERRIBLE. The cheap one that came with my karaoke machine worked better than Nady's. Finally, when I bought this microphone on Amazon, it was $25. Don't waste your money or time on this."
2,Nady SP-4C,"I purchased this as a second microphone for my daughter's Karaoke machine. I bought it prior to her sleepover birthday party. The microphone quit working after an hour usage. The girls were disappointed. So, I ordered a replacement. The replacement worked for a few hours, then it quit.I don't know if we're just unlucky, but I'm not getting a replacement this time. The cheap microphone that came with the Karaoke machine works fine, so I know it's not the kids and I know it's not the machine."
5,Excellent!,"Bought this as a second mic. for my daughter's karaoke machine I had gotten her for Christmas. Wow, the mic. that came with her machine doesn't even hold a candle to the quality of sound this one puts out. I seriously can not find the words to describe how impressed we are with this mic. Even family members who were over for Christmas who sing in a live band were impressed with the quality. I'm very happy with my purchase and am actually going to buy another one to replace the poor quality mic. that came with karaoke machine."
1,stopped working,Mine died too after using it just a few times. I'm replacing it with a different microphone even though it sounded good while it worked.
5,best mic for the price,Works great hooked up to my home theatre reciever! best bang for your buck by far.
3,OK microphone for the price,"Bought this for a small karaoke machine. It arrived quickly, but did not work. I tried another cord and it did work, but I had to return the whole thing due to the faulty cord. Microphone appeared to have decent clean response, and has the feel of a good microphone."
1,"Great Price, bad technology",I purchased this item to use with a small amplifier. After only 45 seconds of use the microphone malfunctioned and stopped working altogether. If you want to actually use the microphone don't buy this one. Also the hassle of returning the product to Amazon is a pain and inconvenient. Maybe somethings still need to be purchased at a brick and mortar store.
3,You get what u pay for,"There's nothing to brag about, it serves its purpose. I expected much more but then again you get what you pay for."
2,alright for the price,"This is an alright mic for the price, it ""feels durable"" and does it job........ but it won't last long. Mine worked for a few months as i was starting my mobile DJ business, needless to say plugging it in over and over messed up the bottom of the 3 prong connector on the mic. NOW i am not saying that this will happen with all the MICs, but i am sure something will go wrong with this unit. You get what you pay for... less than 20 bucks for a professional microphone ..... ill just leave it at that-Good mic for a beginner for the price- DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE A PROFESSIONAL AND YOU ARE GOING TO USE THIS DAILY OR WEEKLY"
3,Good price.....Bad Cable,"I bought this with low expectations. I got what I paid for. The microphone is not too bad for recording, but the cable is where this product lacks. When recording this microphone will make popping and buzzing sounds as well as cut all output from being sent. This can be fixed with a new cable. I used this cable to record vocals and guitar. Overall if you want a cheap mic for just messing around this is it, but for serious recording buy a more upscale brand."
4,great Mic for the price,I bought this to replace one of my broken Mics for Karaoke. ...couldn't find any other Mic with comparable features for the price ($9.99) - it's a nicely weighted Mic with plenty of cable length. Tried it twice for karaoke and it sounds great!
1,Awful,I DJ at some college bars and depend on a microphone to speak to the crowd. This thing broke after two uses. Would not recommend.
1,Worked for exactly 5 days,It stopped working. I guess pretty bad build quality. Pretty much only static and noise after 5 days of normal use.
2,Died in less than two weeks - Seller is great!,"My daughter got this mic for Christmas. Shortly after New Year's, it stopped working. This mic was mangled in shipping, so that probably impacted how long it lasted. Before that, it seemed to work well. The seller (Adorama) was great to work with and took care of the situation completely and easily. I was impressed. So I might not buy this mic again, but I would definitely find another product from that seller."
2,Not recommended,"This low-budget mic really wasn't worth the money. We did get a short bit of play time with it (it was a present for a child with a new keyboard), but the volume/amplification works off and on and sometimes it's static-y. I mean, even for a kid it tries their patience. I give it two stars instead of one because it did sort of work."
1,:(,had to return to factory for replacement did not work from the start...cord did not attach to microphone securely ...disappointed grandchildren on XMas
1,Product failure.,"I regret to Report the non - Dynamic aspect worked briefly, now failed. The Dynamic aspect did not work from Day 1.The Mike will be returned to Amazon, Nady or Goodmans???"
2,Very heavy duty microphone-but cable defective,"This is a remarkably heavy duty, metal microphone with good sound. However, shortly after receiving this, the jacket of the cable separated from the connector nearest the microphone. This was a gift for my grandson. He has taped the cable to the connector. At this price, it is probably not worth returning."
4,Surprisingly good mic,"I was sceptical about this mic, but after reading other reviews gave it a go - and was really happy I did. Using it for band vocals and everyone's happy. It took a while to turn up though!"
5,"Another warm, wonderful poem","The author shows her sensitive/passionate side. In her poem ""Something Extraordinary"" she writes about creation and God. After reading this poem I have to just STOP and stare at the awesome things God has created; especially things like the sunset and the stars. I do hope the author writes another book of poetry, where she can expresses more about herself and her feelings."
5,Great book!,"Great book! Most of the poems should turn into songs. I highly recommend this book, for all ages."
2,bsw maine licensing exam,"The review book seemed like it was a compilation of many different exams some of them not relating to social work at all. There was an answer format that appeared alot in the review but not once on the exam. The answer key would give you options of choosing one or more of the answers as correct. On the licensing exam in maine there is only one correct answer for each question. The review book also seemed to have many wrong answers and really hurt my confidence level going into the exam. In addition to having many wrong answers and typos, there were many sections in which the material or the way the question was worded was much harder than the actual exam questions or content. I do not recommend this review book esp. if you have other reliable sources."
3,OK: Superior rendition of a dime-a-dozen format,"This is a beautifully printed book, in the lavish style that has become the mark of the Timber Press. The general impression is that this is a superior work of its kind, and likely this book will be a big hit with somebody looking for an all-inclusive encyclopedia with very brief entries on tropical gardening plants. The pictures appear to be of a very good quality, although it is hard to be sure given their small size (The pictures are big enough to escape being itty-bitty sized, but not by much)."
3,Too many trees,This is a large lovely reference book about mostly trees and shrubs rather than greenhouse and houseplants that I expected. I was disappointed. It seems well laid out and informative. Somebody else will probably be delighted to add it to their library.
5,Tropical Flower Plants,I purchased this book for my husband because my son had one that he ordered from Amazon and is thoroughlyenjoying it so my husband received his book and will not put it down. So much information concerningtropical plants. We love tropical plants and this book is a great help.
4,Help,"I've read great things about this series, but I'm foggy on how Explode the Code 2 and an Explode the Code 2 1/2 relate to one another? Can anyone explain?"
5,Easy to use & works!,My dog had ulcers in her mouth from an auto-immune disease (vasculitis) and the odor from her mouth about knocked us over. I started using this 2 times a day and I noticed a huge improvement in 3 days. This product helped her sores and her breath. I wouldn't be without it!
4,Got rid of dogs bad breath,After only a week of using this every night on my dogs teeth the terrible smell of his breath from a rotten tooth nearly cleared up 100%.
1,Atrocious recording quality,"I found any appreciation of Richter's phenomenal ability virtually impossible because of the terrible quality of the recording of this CD (and I enjoy his performance of Mussorgsky's ""Pictures at an Exhibition"", even though the recording quality is quite poor there also). But something has gone seriously wrong with this CD -- there is the usual bronchial Russian audience, but I can overlook that. It is the sound itself, which is badly distorted, with digital clicks -- this leads me to believe that the problem arises from a very poor re-mastering. Richter also recorded Beethoven's 3rd Concerto for Deutche Gramophon with the Vienna SO conducted by Sanderling, in the 60's. Surely they will reissue this recording soon -- it is the one to wait for, unless a new re-mastering can salvage the Kondrashin one."
2,Required Text,"This is a required text at my school, but after having read the first 5 chapters there is almost nothing of value that I have read. I have spoken to several people that have used this text for the class in prior semesters and they told me that they had stopped reading it after the first several chapters also."
4,its ok,i like it did pop corn once with it will try it maby on steam corn or vegetable and see if will tase that good
4,The Kid Loves the Legos,"This was a gift for my five year old. Legos are no longer limited to the tub of assorted pieces from which you attempt to craft masterpieces that last just until your mother vacuums the rug. Nowadays Lego has pursued more thematic kits. They come with instructions so that any reasonably bright child can create exactly what is pictured on the front of the kit. That has some inherent satisfaction--everyone can be a Lego master. Besides, in the typical household, the kit will ultimately be blended into the big tub o' Lego and the fire pick-up truck will become but a fond memory with parts visible in much larger creations.Legos are great. In any form. For any age."
4,he will enjoy this,"a small project, and legos are way overpriced, but grandson likes it because it has figure of a person which he uses a lot, he makes many interesting 'things' by mixing these pieces with other sets"
2,Not a fan,I am not a big fan of this. The toy is small and definitely for older children. My husband had to put it together for my kids who are 4 and 6. They broke it many times and kept coming back for help to fix it.
5,firefighter Legos,I love firefighting Legos Legos favorite thing please fire and paramedi I hope to get more soon Legos are fun
5,Great Cable,"I was a little leery about this cable, because of the price vs. length. Guess what, it has been working GREAT! I've used it a number of times in recording sessions that spanned through the whole house and am very pleased with it. Feel confident buying this cable."
4,Nady XC-50,"I was setting up a PA system in a new retail store that needed a long cable with an XLR hookup. I can't speak for the noise quality of this cord because for my purposes low noise is not a big issue. I can say that it delivers a clear voice signal over the 50ft. This cable was reasonable priced compared to most XLR cables where when they get over ten feet they cost a forture. For what I needed this cable was perfect, didn't break the budget, and so far has worked fine."
3,Great price,"This cable is good and the price is even better. I had to knock out 2 star because the connectors while they still perform their duty are not of the high quality as others. This one leave me wondering when it would break. buy a different brand if you can, if not these will get the job done."
3,"Great for the price, not without problems.","This is a really well priced cable for the length, so you will have to compromise on a few things. The connecters are alright, but not the best I've seen. I also think that there is a little bit of noise in the cable. Decent for the price, but if you spend more you'll get more."
2,Cheep,"On amazon, I consistently find great deals that blow other prices out of the water. Occasionally you find a deal that's too good to be true - thats the case with these cables... not worth the $ saved - they're cheaply made - you have to jam them into the receptacles - They fit so snug I wonder if i'm ever going to get them out... or sound guy gently encouraged ""lets not buy these again..."""
1,Don't waste your money!,Piece of Garbage. Purchased 1/31/12 and already is crapping out on me. Going to purchase Monster - you get what you pay for!
4,For the TRUE MONEY GETTAS,"Major figgas is a hot group consist of some PHilly peoples that are gettin down. Check the mixtapes and FLEX AND KAP album for Dutch and SPade on the song ""Dead Man Walking"" with newcomer of the year Beanie Seigal. These two cats are hot, collectively with the other make the song good. The song has calypso beat for the dancers and for listeners, smooth flow with some truthful statements like ya'll pushin same whip I had in 86 and that for you fake ballers.So For the thugs and ballers lets continue to get that dough."
4,"Response to ""L. Calvo""","In response to the alarm activation issue posted by ""L. Calvo"". Look on the bottom on the clock, there is a ""receiver switch"". If the clock is not being used with a signaler, turn the receiver switch ""OFF"". This possibly could resolve your problem. This unit is designed to also work with other Sonic Alert Products for the hearing impaired. If the switch is in the ""ON"" position, the built in receiver will pick up signals from other electrical units within the household, which will create the constant activation. The enclosed manual with the product does state, ""turn the receiver ""OFF"" if no other products (other then the shaker) are being used with it."
1,very disappointing,"Unfortunately, this alarm clock would turn on at random times and would not turn off unless I unplugged it. I exchanged it for another and this too had the same problems. I returned it and was told this item was problematic."
4,Useful remote,"I have a Samsung LCD tv, Sony home theater, Dish network and a sony dvd player.Expect for the home theater remotes works excellent for the other three things. For home thetare - if we are not playing DVD then we use the DVD option on remote and then we get the desired functionallity.Cheap remote and works fine. Recommended"
2,Recommend model URC 8910,Customer Service at 'One for All' was excellent but this model cannot be upgraded by phone. They recommend URC 8910 which is only slightly more expensive. I would recommend that model. This did not have the codes I needed to program for TV or DVD player.
2,Didn't work well for me,"My original remote for my t.v. broke. I bought this one to replace it and thought that if it would control at least as much of my dvd/vcr functions as the original t.v. remote had done, so much the better. But it controls only a limited number of the functions for each and will not allow full use of the devices' menus. Contrary to the other very positive reviews here, I am not impressed!"
4,"Pretty decent remote, but...","The CON's:I bought this remote after returning a URC-8910 from the same company and several unsuccessful attempts to get the 8910 to work with my JVC combo DVD+/-RW VCR unit. My hope was that this URC-6820 was a more modern remote and might natively support devices the 8910 did not. I was wrong. I haven't gotten to it yet, but it looks like I will have to ""learn"" all the functions of my JVC remote to the URC-6820.The PRO's:Packed with features for the price. The unified power on/off is an especially nice feature. Some more excellent features:- More buttons can be retasked than the 8910.- Much larger memory cache for learned buttons and macros.- Runs on 2 rather than 4 batteries and holds custom settings properly when replacing batteries.- Nice ""heft"" and balance in the hand. Controls well placed.- JP1.2 interface for PC programming (haven't tried this yet but it looks like some serious geek fun)."
4,Great Tension!,"Elizabeth Dupres is daughter of Bitsy Dupres, the head of the committee who is protesting the presence of Carnies in their town. Prior to meeting Carlo Fuentes, Elizabeth follows her mother in the protest, not really beleiving in it but wanting to support her mother. At first sight however, Elizabeth and Carlo connect.They each restore the other's faith in certain parts of humanity and help the other grow stronger as a person. The tension between them is amazing! With the book remaining in the PG/PG-13 rage it is very impressive.Definately something different--though I can't imagine people protesting a carnival in this day and age."
2,"""ODD!""","This book was a little interesting, but I also thought it was a bit odd, especially towards the end. I also think that there were some missing pages....I didn't get why his eggs were blue!?"
1,Not for beginners,"There is an explanation section for each dance but it is too fast pace to grasp and not enough details are given for your moves. If you already know the dance moves, then you may already be in shape and won't need the video.I now own a disc that won't do me any good."
4,Very long dvd,Level = advancedstyle = USA aerobics with some latin styling.This is more like a very long exercise class. Very few cues. You would have to watch the screen all the time.There is no instruction on the steps during the sections except at the steps explained section.It is a very good exercise dvd. At over 2 hours it is great value for money.I did find some of the steps boring esp the non latin steps.I did not really enjoy the warm ups or cool down sections. I thought these could have be better done.I did not like how the dvd was divided into sections as I would of liked to skip the warm up sections.But overall it is an enjoyable exercise dvd.
2,Good and Bad,"First the good-I like her teaching style. You learn a move and a new one is added on until you have a whole routine.The bad-The warm up is way too fast for a warm up. The cool down has yoga moves in it which are not appropriate for this video.Finally, each dance routine starts with the same warm up and ends with the same cool down and I always have to fast forward thru each one to continue dancing at the aerobic pace until I am ready to cool down."
4,Fantastic,"I love our Linksys products, especially this one. I would give it 5 stars if it didn't break the connection when I used my Uniden 2.4GHz Digital Phone. They don't seem compatable and I have to reset the switch after I am done with the phone to get the connection back. Other than that I have had no problems with this at all."
1,Don't Try to Use with Linux!,"I bought this card specifically because I found it listed as compatible on the Linux-WLAN project website ...However, Linksys has changed chipsets from the Prism2 to the Realtek chipset (as have most of the manufacturers) without updating the model numbers or packaging, so I couldn't even figure out it wasn't going to work until I plugged it in and discovered the switch! Luckily I have a Windows machine I can use it with. If you want a reliable card for Linux, try the Netgear MA311 instead."
2,Don't try to use it indoors across a brick wall,"I try this and the signal strenght was not enough to reach the router located at mere 40 feets from the WAP11. Like reviewer ""Swimmer79"" I think Linksys should have separated the antenna from the card and allowed users to put the antenna somewhere else via a cable. With the antenna mounted on the back of the card directly, you have to orient the PC with the back (the antenna)pointing to the router to get better signal which is not always possible. Under this conditions (brick walls) I would recommend to use a Wireless USB Adapter (WUSB11 or similar)or a Wireless Access Point (WAP11 or equivalent)which is separated from the PC, so you can place it in the best position to obtain a good link."
4,Firmware upgrade is a must !!,"I brought my Linksys WMP11 on 5/5/02 and installed on a 4 year old computer running Windows 98 on 166 MHz and 96 Mb on board. At first it does not work. But after upgrading the firmware, it works perfect. The procedure is to run the firmware upgrade software, then remove the card and put it back again. The computer will flash the card at this point and afterwards I got very fast and stable connection."
1,Does Not Work,"I purchased this card and the WAP11 Wireless Access Point to connect my ethernet network with a machine I placed upstairs in my home. Even at no more than 40ft from the A.P. the card could not connect (supposedly works up to 300ft indoors). When I called Linksys, the rep told me that the card does not work well when it is between the computer and a wall, and may not work well near the computer's power supply. (That defeats the purpose of having a PCI card.) I decided to return the card and A.P. I purchased Home Phone Line Netwoking equipment and it works fine."
3,Don't even think about ...,"... using this with the WAP11 access point WITHOUT upgrading the firmware first (on both of them!). Unless of course you would like a wild ride through hell during installation. Linksys support for their wireless products is near non-existent. I was on hold for more than 3 hours and then I gave up (good thing I have headset phone!). I tried again the next day waited on hold for 1 hour and then gave up. I was about to return the WAP11 and WMP11, when I decided to upgrade the firmware on the WMP11 (I had already upgraded the firmware on the WAP11). After hours and hours of frustration, and finally, the firmware upgrade, it worked! I have the WAP11 in my basement and my computer with the WMP11 on the main floor, I get 73% signal strength and link quality."
3,"Works well, tough install, bad support.","In the end, it works well. Annoying install problems...the firmware had to be upgraded before it would work at all! And the configuration utility regularly reports that the firmware is out of data and must be upgraded. Linksys Tech Support said NOT to do this under any circumstances. ??"
3,No Linux support,i just got this card installed. It rocks on windows 2000 and works well with Netgear router. But it is based on broadcom chipset. Broadcom has not released drivers for Linux. so this card does not work on linux :-((.
2,Poor Technical Support,"I recently bought a Lynksys Wireless PCI Adapter (WMP11) for my daughter's Dell computer. I installed the card and software per directions. Each time I restart the computer I have to manually connect to my wireless router. I called 24 hour technical support center located in India. I had to ask the person to repeat themselves several times because of their strong dialect. The individual had to ask me to hold on several times while they searched for a solution. After about 30 minutes to an hour of following his directions I am no better off and, in fact, I am having more of a problem connecting to the router than I did before I made the call. Linksys has a great name in network products but before I make my next purchase, I will research companies that have US based help center."
2,Windows XP Compatibility,The signal strength is not very strong and other products have better and many of the firmware upgrades have bugs in them when being used with Windows XP.
1,Does not work with Windows XP,"Contrary to what Linksys state and say on their packaging this product does not work with Windows XP.I am currently pursuing legal action against Linksys as they will not refund the purchase but only replace it with the same product. This has already been done and it's the same problem.Do not purchase any Linksys wireless products as even though you may be lucky enough to get some working, there technical support is useless and they continuously lie to you."
1,Horrible throughput,Tech support (reached after 50 minutes on hold) told me to upgrade the firmware when I was getting almost no throughput. Tried it--didn't work (even after physically removing the PCI card). Firmware wouldn't update correctly. Second call to tech support (30 minutes on hold) said the firmware upgrade was only for WinXP (I'm using Win98SE). Finally sent the card back.
1,This isn't a finished product!,"I couldn't get the Linksys WMP11 to install on my Windows 95 PC. Evidently, according to Linksys tech support, version 2.7 of the WMP11 installation CD-ROM doesn't have all the necessary drivers, despite the fact that the Linksys technical documentation says that Windows 95 is supported. The necessary drivers ""should be ready in a few days"" according to Linksys technical support. They suggested returning the product to the retailer and getting the version 1 WMP 11 product instead. Only problem is, you can't tell from the box what version of the software it contains. Oh, and yes, the instructions that came with the WMP11 were in French. Hope you've brushed up on your French recently....."
1,USED to be good,"I have had this product for a little over a year now and it is terrible. I don't know if it's just a defective chip or anything, but it really got me mad. When i first got it the thing worked fine , but in the last couple of weeks it has been horrible. The signal strength has been either low or very low and i am constantly losing internet. I tried to call tech support once and it gave me some Indian guy that I couldn't really understand. Not only that, but all he did was tell me stuff i already knew like click repair on the connection in My Network Places and restart the computer. If they are all like this one that I have then I reccomend not getting this item."
1,could not install on W2K,"I simply could not get my W2K machine to consistently recognize this card. The Linksys configuration utility would tell me that the device was not installed. On those few occassions that the card was recognized, trying to change the setting would lock my computer. Linksys support was very difficult to reach, and the only useful advice they gave was to, ""send the card back!"""
3,Not compatible with Windows XP,"I might be a bird brain, but I didn't notice this product wasn't compatible with windows xp. I purchased their router which was operational out of the box. However, the wmp11 wireless pci network card won't work. when i called linksys the tech support told me flat out that i needed a different card. too bad for me i already discarded the original packaging. it should be directly stated on their packaging WON'T WORK WITH WINDOWS XP."
1,Couldn't get it to work with Win98 and SMC Access Point,"I bought this wireless PCI card to connect a Windows 98 desktop machine to an SMC Wireless Barricade Access Point/Broadband Router. After getting a solid signal (66%), and updating all sorts of settings in the Windows Registry (MaxMTU), I still couldn't get it to work reliably -- web pages would load increibly slowly and almost never finish. I turned the WEP encryption off and even called Linksys Tech Support, but to no avail. I would not recommend this product unless you have a Linksys Access Point. I returned this product."
2,Disappointed - twice,"I had one of these cards in my kids computer and have fought each time I reboot to connect to my wireless gateway. When I put another computer in the house I purchased the same card ""thinking"" that it must have been improved. NOT!!!I have downloaded the latest firmware on these cards and they still have trouble connecting to the gateway. My laptop with built in wirelss works great...just not these cards.My gateway is all Linkysis products and for some reason I stayed with this brand and am disappointed."
1,Not worth the trouble,"Despite everything I have tried, this unit crashes my XP system. Linksys tech support is no help....they eventually said (in almost unintelligble english)...""Well, there is something wrong, but we can't help you"".I went out and bought another brand, popped it in and it worked perfectly. I threw this one in the trash."
3,DO NOT USE FOR ONLINE GAMING IN WinXP,"The configuration utilities that ship with Linksys wireless products will not install/run properly on WinXP, Linksys requires you to use the WinXP Wireless Zero Configuration (WZC) service. One feature of WZC is that once every minute it will drop the current signal in search of a better one, resulting in constant, annoying interruptions to your online play. Thus, if you try to use Linksys wireless products for online gaming, prepare to be VERY annoyed. Otherwise, the card seems to work fine for normal web browsing."
1,Linksys driving me insane,I have had absolutely no trouble at all with my 2 Linksys Laptop wireless adapters and they work great but the WMP11 PCI card is driving me nuts. On the two occasions when I have managed to persuade the Linksys configuration software that the card is in fact installed I have not been able to get any throughput from my wireless router. Now the configuration utility absolutely refuses to acknowledge the fact that the PCI card is in the machine and uninstalling software and taking out the card and redoing the bizarre installation procedure doesn't help. JMP
4,Hot Tip--call Tech Support VERY EARLY IN THE AM,"I've read the other reviews stating that Linksys tech support is less than stellar. I've had great luck calling on a Saturday morning, very early <about 7am EST>. Got thru in about 3 minutes and was on the phone w/ a woman located in the Philapinnes. After about 25 minutes I was up and running <it would've been a lot shorter but it takes forever to restart my Win 98 PC>. Signal coverage is awesome. I highly recommend Linksys products even though I've needed tech support help."
2,Changing the product without changing the name.,"This product has recently (as of 9/2002) changed to a Broadcom chipset. Despite this relativly major switch the company decided not to change the name, this has caused major headaches. As you can imagine, the firmware update for the old chipset refuse to install on the new boards (as it would ruin them), there is driver problems and inconsistencies, and if you intend to run this card in linux forget about it. The broadcom chipset doesn't work with any of the latest linux-wlan-ng builds. In windows XP this board was alright but still problematic; tech support was courteous but MUCH less than helpful."
4,Linksys WMP11 - easy setup-works well,"Bought this PCI card for my daughter's 5 year old Compaq running Windows 98. Bottom line; it installed easily and works well. Just follow the directions. The router is in the basement and my daughters room is on the first floor at the far end of the house.The signal strength is 87% and the signal quality is 93%.One minor hitch. Although the hardware was working, I could not get any web pages to load until I went into the Device Manager and disabled the internal dial-up modem. (r. click My Computer > l.click properties > l. click Device Manager > l. click plus sign on network adapters > l.click on your internal modem > l.click on properties and check box - disable in hardware profile. Do the same with Dial-Up Adapter.) After that - no problem - works well."
4,Decent card at a decent price.,"This card is very easy to work with. Just plug the card in setup the drivers and you're good to go. I'm running an all Linksys setup so compatibility isn't an issue. My only nitpick is with the antenna, it will only stand straight up or down, there is no way to keep it from dropping if you mount it sideways. My VGA cable is right above the network card so the antenna won't stay up. I lose some signal strength when its facing down, so I have to tape the antenna off to the side to get the best signal."
2,Do you really need it??? Think Twice!!!,You may be better off running a Cable to your PC than using this as a PC is not as extremely mobile as your laptop. Connecting your server with WMP11 to the network is a bad idea. As you will be suffering with low data transfer speeds and your whole network kind of seems to be slow...Not much of a practical use!!!
2,Not as good.... Stick with USB adapters,"This wireless network card is somewhat okay compared to a lot of wireless network products. The LONG antenna in the back of the card is hard to adjust since it is in the back of the computer tower. Sometimes the wireless ethernet card seems to lag or pause while i use the internet.It doesn't seem to have a good range compared to the Linksys WUSB11 Wireless USB Adapter.I recommend the Linksys Wireless USB network adapter (WUSB11) more although it has a long usb cable. And i also recommend the Linksys Wireless PC card (WPC11) and they both work for PC's and laptops.If you hate USB wires or do not have a pc card slot, then get this wireless ethernet card. Other than that, don't get it."
4,Excellent performance - but setup was strange.,"I'm very happy with the Linksys WMP11 PCI Wireless NIC. It has an actual real antenna that sticks out of the back of the PC and which can be adjusted to get the optimum signal strength. The only problem I had was with the Windows XP wireless networking setup utility doing battle with the utility provided with the one that shipped with the card. I suppose I could have let the Windows-provided utility handle the card but, in the end, I unchecked the box that allowed it to manage the card. This let me use the Linksys utility to handle the setup and things were smooth from then on. Signal strength is excellent - much better than from the SMC PCI card I'd been using earlier. Whether this was a function of having the antenna, rather than SMC's back plastic PC-card type protrusion, I don't know.I would like to see better instructions from Linksys on how to set these cards up in Windows XP, but I have absolutlty no complaints about the card itself."
1,Do not use WMP11 with HP Pavilion,"After wasting an *enormous* amount of time (over a week), I found that the Linksys WMP11 causes my HP Pavilion with AMD CPU to freeze hard and neither HP nor Linksys were able to resolve. I even tried returning the WMP11 for a replacement in case it was bad, but the replacement did exactly the same thing. I just changed to a TRENDnet TEW-228PI wireless PCI card that works great! The problem with the WMP11 was complicated to diagnose because it connected fine. If no data was transferred, no problem. But once you start transferring data thru the WMP11, it would crash (hard freeze) the system within a small random interval (2-5 minutes). Buyer beware."
2,No linux support & disconnects frequently under windows 2000,"This card is one of the worst purchases I have ever made for my computer. Even the version of the card is still unknown to me (they have released many different versions of the card under the WMP11 model).Under windows I lose the connection very often (even though singal strength stays at a constant %47 (another computer using a DLink card keeps its connection) and must resort to disabling the device and re-enabling it to restore the connection.When I asked about linux drivers for this card I got this letter from linksys' support:""Currently we don't have drivers for our WMP11 for linux operating system and we do not support linux OS. You may want to keep posted on our site for further updates.""I'm not buying anything else from these novices. I'm going to stick with serious companies like DLink and Netgear, whose products do work."
1,Doesn't work for Linux,"The title says it all--if you're trying to WiFi a Linux box, go with a different vendor (D-Link or Lucent would be a good bet).RedHat 8 doesn't have any drivers, and none can be found on the web. ***Note: you will see reference to Linksys drivers, but they only work for the first generation of this card. The one sold here (and probably everywhere else as well) is version 2, and it has a new chipset that doesn't have any driver support.Unless you consider yourself a Linux guru, enjoy hacking kernels and writing custom drivers, look elsewhere."
2,Backward configuration,This PCI card works only if you install the software first before inserting the card to the PCI slot.
2,Flies like a rock,You'll get lots of exercise running after this so called kite because all it does is crash.
5,Put the forks down.. Use the docker,"I had worked at a couple different pizza joints when growing up around Chicago, so I had memories of this item, especially when I started making pizza at home. I guarantee once you start using this instead of forks to score the dough you will never go back. This product in particular has worked great, should last a lifetime."
4,it is what itv is,"cant fail with sierra parts always less than OEM really cant tell the differencequick turn around on delivery ,note always make double sure you get the part number right"
4,No longer has Nero software.,"I bought the 16x10x40x (actually 16x12x40x) to replace my cd drive. It was easier to install than I had expected. Sadly, the unit now comes with NTI software which is somewhat limited and not as nearly as nice as Nero. It is another [amount] to get the pro version of the software."
1,"Actually, less than one star","I purchased one of these in March. It quit operating in mid-July. I have been trying unsuccessfully since then to obtain technical support and warranty replacement. When I call tech support (long distance, you pay) I get put on hold from 10 to 20 minutes to only end up being transferred to voice mail. When they return my call it is the next day while I'm gone. I am very unsatisfied with their service.As for the drive, you cannot use name brand disks in it. They only recommend off brands. The software that comes with it doesn't work properly. You have to go out to Adaptec to find the missing drivers. Altogether a very bad investment. Buy a CD-ROM or CD-RW or DVD from a name brand, not these people."
1,Possibly the worst book I've ever read,"I bought the book because about 2 years ago I began my own project in the Texas Hill Country. My husband and I own some land there, and we've been working on it and enjoying it tremendously.Mr. Graves' book must be the most boring piece of writing I have ever read, and I'm a serious reader. I don't usually write reviews, but this book was so bad I simply had to respond.So don't bother reading the book; there's much better stuff out there. And please, do not form a negative opinion about the Texas Hill Country based on this book. The fact that the author has nothing interesting to say about it doesn't mean that there is nothing interesting to talk about. The area is beautiful, and there certainly is much more to it than what you'll find in Mr. Graves' ramblings."
1,Nasty Playing,"This CD is complete and total garbage. Do not waste your money on this CD. The playing is very sloppy, the rythm unstable, and it's overpriced. Do not buy this CD!"
4,"Great performance, but rather poor recording as expected","Julian Sitkovetsky's poetic musicality and enchanting tone can no doubt be heard here. The music has a lot of constrast and colors, and actually the recording has decent dynamic range and clarity. The only problem is that the texture of the sound (alas, 50's soviet technology) is quite harsh, which spoils a bit the joy of listening to Sitkovetsky's golden singing tone."
3,Does the job,"Labels either work in your printer, or they don't. These work and hold the ink just fine. I needed to order labels quickly and found these at the top of the list. However, there are other venders that make these labels for a fair price. Searching for ""Avery compatible"" will reveal the more competitive alternatives, although shipping cost may also be a consideration."
5,stickers for preschool,We use these to make stickers for our preschool. We have a letter of the day and sometimes it is hard to find stickers to go along with each letter. So we just make our own. They are also easier for the children to remove than some traditional stickers.
3,Templates could be easier to use.,The labels are very nice but i still have not spent the time to adjust things. The template does not print perfectly.
5,Labels,These labels work well just what i needed to print some of my christmas labes. Works well with my printer.
5,Perfect for what I needed,"I printed ""happy birthday"" in a circle going all around the label and put it in the middle of a scallop edged circle to make a tag. This label worked perfectly. I had to adjust the image slightly after printing out 1 sheet, but the 1st sheet was still very usable. The template sheet that came in the package was very helpful. The labels are ever so slightly see through (not a big deal for me, but maybe for someone else?) but they are a fun size and great for casual uses."
1,I rate this at Zero,"We ordered this product from outside the US, delivered to an address in the US, so that we could use it on our travels throughout the country. Unfortunately it would only charge a little on the first overnight charge, and after using that charge, we couldn't recharge it. It has been a major problem.We are returning the product for a refund."
5,Flame's Finest,"I have heard both of Flame's previous cd's and they were ok. I could skip several tracks on the first and even more on the second. This cd, however, is the BEST Flame has put out. I didn't skip one track on it. The beats were grimmy, the lyrics were passionate and meaningful. This is Flame's best effort and I recommend it to anyone."
4,Good album,This is my first Flame album and I was impressed. First thing I noticed is what an awesome hip hop voice he has. After that I noticed how good his lyrics are and how well they represent the Gospel.Good album to reach out to youth with. Flame and Lecrae do a great job of making music that appeals to the secular crowd but they both rep Jesus in their lyrics. That's an awesome ability.God bless.
4,Joan Crawford letters show she was much more ....,"Joan Crawford's letter's in the book, ""Her Life in Letter's"" shows she was much more that what was depicted of her in ""Mommie Dearest."" This book does show Joan in a new light. It shows she was compassionate, caring, sincere and kind. All of those things mentioned were not shown of Joan in the book/movie ""Mommie Dearest"", that is why this is an important book for Joan's image and a great homage to her fans. The letters in this book are very interesting and leaves room for more books to follow since Joan wrote hundreds of thousands of letters over her lengthy career. I really enjoyed reading the letters in this book and the photos were great as well. Thank you for releasing something positive and insightful about the icon, Joan Crawford."
3,Joan's letters,"I couldn't wait for this book to come out! This book of letters is something that's not been done before. Joan's devotion to her fans is clearly evident. The pictures in the book are wonderful, and it was a rare treat to have Casey LaLonde provide the foreword!I'm looking forward to seeing more from Michelle Vogel. I really enjoyed reading this book. More on Crawford!"
4,A personal look at Crawford,"The personal feel of this book really makes it stand out from the many other books written on Joan Crawford. I felt I got to know Joan Crawford, the woman, and it's rare to find that in a book, unless the book is written (honestly and without reservation) by the book's subject.With Crawford passing away almost three decades ago, this is the closest we're ever going to get to reading Joan Crawford's thoughts and feelings again. Any true Crawford fans will relish the release of this book.A beautiful tribute."
5,Read this one!,Since many people have weighed in on this book I won't ramble on and repeat their thoughts but I enjoyed this book so much I felt that I should give a positive review of it. The only flaw that I had was that it was too short. I didn't want it to end. I was so engrossed with Crawford's letters I found myself wanting more and more.Great read!
1,Buyer Beware,"Buyer BewareBefore you spend your money buying this book you should know that:1) It [appears that it] has not been proofread2) There are inaccurate facts sprinkled throughout the book that any fan of Joan Crawford will recognize immediately (what fan doesn't know the name of Joan's first picture?)3) A great many of the letters are available for free viewing at more than one fan website, and can be seen in their entirety, rather than transcribed portionsIf historical accuracy, original material, and literate writing are important to you, you will be disappointed.If, as a fan of Joan Crawford, owning copies of these freely available letters in book form overrides mis-typed words and facts that you know are wrong, then you will not be disappointed."
1,The author should study English composition,"I gave this book one star for the following reasons. When I buy a book, I expect that its author will have had the respect for his or her readers to have put out an edited and proofread product. This book has far more than a few typos (not ""typo's""). It is rife with incomplete sentences and inconsistent and/or incorrect punctuation. Language, grammar, words, sentence structure, spelling, etc., are a writer's tools of trade, so it's a puzzle why this book is such a mess. Even self-published books must meet some standards. Joan Crawford's letters prove that she used and respected the rules of literate writing and, if she was the perfectionist she was reputed to have been, I can only believe she would scorn this book. It baffles me how her ardent fans can condone it. Surely they should demand better for their beloved Joan Crawford."
2,Rather a joke.,"A bunch of letters copied from online. Okay, but what do you do with them? Author Vogel doesn't do anything but slap them down on pages and create a lot of filler to go with them: a meatloaf recipe (!), a completely unrelated section on ""celebrity stalkers."" And somehow she got Joan Crawford's grandson to write an introduction, which was only very mildly interesting.Vogel's original contribution to the book (that is, the part aside from Joan's letters) was an introduction that attempts to give some insight into Joan's career, life, etc. I've only read it once, but already counted 6 or 7 factual errors. And it's poorly written to boot.(...) It's poorly written, and the quality of the pages and photos is poor, as well."
2,It's OK,"I'm glad to see letters from Miss Crawford to show another side of her but alot of the letters are just chit-chat and don't say that much of interest. There's also a problem with the facts here. I know a little about Miss Crawford, well more than a little, and there's so much that's just not correct. (Some people allready mentioned specifics below so I won't repeat them.) The introduction from Joan's grandson was interesting to read. But overall you can tell that not alot of time and effort went into the book as far as the facts and writing. (I've also read most of these same letters on-line so I was kind of hoping for different letters from the ones I had allready seen.)"
5,excellent,The service was second to none and the product was excellent. Will use Amazon again and recommend to friends
5,Buy it!,Love this cd. It's old so the lyrics are kind of dated but there are some great tunes on it. She's come a long way since then but this is definitely worth buying until her new stuff comes out!
3,Dilana,"Well, loved Dilana on Rockstar, she did the music justice. Don't expect anything like that here, the music is more mellow and focused. Still a good buy, I hesitate to say this but it is probably directed more to the female audience than male.Good stuff Dilana :)"
3,Disappointed,"I really enjoyed Dilana's performances on SuperNova ~ thought she had a great voice, and she does. However, the songs are really bad. All of the songs sound like she's trying to get over an old love. A new song writer with some imagination and I think her future cds will be a lot better."
5,Love this CD!,"I agree that she's the new Melissa Etheridge and then some! For the men out there who thinks she'll rock out like on Rock Star it's not so much the case. I'd classify it as having more ""chick"" songs, but my husband still likes it. :-) There's no escaping Dilana's talent regardless of what type of song she sings."
3,Great Vocalist,"Dilana is an absolute star. The material, production and instrumental work on this recording isn't real good but her vocals make it enjoyable. If you are one of the people who loved her on Rock Star then get this, you won't be sorry."
4,dilana,"Bought this on the back of Rock Star Supernova because I truly believed Dilana should have walked this, I love this CD, the only disappointment was that she only wrote a couple of tracks as watching the show I feel she has great talent but maybe on the next one we will hear more of Dilanas own songs but a fab album would highly recommend this"
1,Very disappointed,"This pillow unlike every other memory foam pillow I've ever had, is not one piece of foam, but a mush of foam in a single pocket. It's lumpy, it's soft, and it stinks. I'd return it if I could."
1,No Cloud for my head,"High and hard; very uncomfortable. It made my neck hurt. And it does have a strong chemical smell that gave me a headache the next morning. I sat on it all day before using it, but it did not soften up.Not recommending it, esp. since it cannot be returned since it is a personal item."
2,tempur-pedic pillows are made very poorly,"My husband and I have tempur-pedic pillows. I personally hate them. They are lumpy and weigh alot. My husband likes the pillows for comfort and neck support, but within 1-2 months, the inside lining that holds all the loose crumbled foam, it rips easily and makes the foam lumpy and uneven and the pillow is very unsightly. Tempur-pedic should have found a way by now to improve the quality of the inner lining to prevent this. We paid $100 for each pillow and wehave exchanged the pillows twice. I just find it very disappointing that this keeps happening for the cost of this product."
1,Way too hard,"Let me start by saying that I love my tempurpedic mattress; I think it was one of the best purchases that I ever made. Also, my husband loves this pillow, would give it 5 stars, so YMMV.Simply put, even though this is supposed to be the soft pillow in the Tempurpedic line, it is way too hard. I used it for 3 months, and every single morning, I woke up with the worst headache. I finally had to give up and go back to my old down filled pillows, which is unfortunate, because this was really good for my neck.If you like a VERY FIRM pillow, you may find this product useful."
3,Perfect...until something spills on it and leaks through to the foam.,"Tempur-Pedic have to come up with a pillow cover that is truly water-resistant without having a plastic cover that makes noise all night(the only alternative). My dog has a weak bladder and peed on it(I know, haha-funny, until later)and it soaked through the pillowcase,outer cover,AND the inner cover to the foam in seconds. I know the directions say not to wash the pillow, but what other options did I have besides sleeping on a pissy pillow?! So I washed it and yes, ruined it.So just be warned when you purchase one of these $150 pillows:don't let it get soiled by something you won't want to sleep on or you'll be out a pillow!"
2,"Great at first, but declined quickly.","I loved this form fitting memory pillow at first. I slept through the night like a corpse, hardly moving; calm, restful nights' sleeps. My girlfriend called it ""the brick"" because is was heavy and felt really stiff, but it did the job, forming around my head and neck snugly. BUT, after about 8 weeks it has lost its firmness and memory and is like a cheap foam pillow. Having paid $130 dollars for a pillow I expect a whole heck of a lot more than this, particularly from a respected brand such as Tempurpedic. VERY DISAPPOINTED. I would NOT RECOMMEND this pillow to anyone. I don't plan on spending this much on a pillow again."
5,hello kitty seat covers,"these were blue and subtle and very well priced. because they were so reasonable i was worried about the quality, but when they arrived they were great!"
5,GREAT,Love the Poster...its looks great and arrived package properly and no damage. Great company to buy from for posters. They even threw in an additional poster of Sunset Beach. How can you go wrong.THANKS
2,peuny,"If you like folks squinting and asking you ""whats that supposed to be?"" then this is the pendant for you. Its rather small to the point where the features are not noticable, and its very light. If it were larger I think I'd of liked it. It would make for a good ""charm"" persay, for a bracelet perhaps though. To each 'is own."
4,Sturdy towel hanging solution,"The rack comes in a lot of pieces, but it's easy to put together. Mounting to the wall is a bit tricky, as the installation instructions suggest a physical impossibility of using a screwdriver where the rods of the top shelf clearly block its path. (just remove a few of the rods and re-install after the rack is mounted to the wall)Once installed, the rack is quite strong. We've only had ours up for a week, but it's handling the yanking of heavy towels with aplomb. It's a pretty bulky unit, and it looks a bit larger in our tiny bathroom than I imagined.Update: We've been using this rack for 2+ years now and still really like it. It takes a lot of abuse and holds up fine. The finish is still like new despite a really humid environment (can't say the same for our chrome shower curtain rod). And I take back the ""bulky"" comment - I don't even notice it's there anymore. Buy it if you like the style. It will serve you well."
1,save your money,"As a big fan of Zeppelin I bought this album thinking that there would be a few good blues/rock tunes on it. I was disappointed. Page's playing on the songs with De Groot singing is pretty plain, almsot just rythm guitar. The second set of songs with the other singer, Sutch, are just horrible. He screams over the music sounding worse than the cheesiest of early 80's hair metal. Don't buy this."
4,This is a fantastic record!,"I disagree with the Music Fan. This is a great snapshot of London rock from that era. It is plain. It is not Led Zeppelin by any means. But the songs are great and sound fresh, not unlike the music being played by the likes of the White Stripes. A really fun record. Worth adding to your collection"
1,Flimsy construction,I've had this set for less than a year and already two of the couples have broken. Very flimsy construction.
4,"Mere Fates ""Light of Day - deserves to see the Light of Day.","This CD is pretty cool sounding in the context of music normality and HAS A QUALITY that the flavor of the day music{jammed in our ears by popular culture and the music bussiness gatekeepers}lacks....so much good music is never heard by the mass's.Yes, these sounds,forms,formats,styles or whatever you label it have been heard before. But in music, there is nothing new under the sun, only new interpretations and variations on a theme.These songs sound like music made by a band that enjoys music creation.Unlike the flavor of the day music which sounds like music made only to make money.Whether you listen to music for rhythm,texture,thought provoking content or rockin out driving music the songs on mere fates cd accomplish what i think the band has tryed to do, and that is make decent music.Give it a listen and discover your own new music.Anthony"
1,Transfer Is A Disaster! That's Why Only 1 Star!!,"Despite my 1 star rating, this is indeed a 5 Star performance, the best performance since Scherchen's early 50's Westminster Mono Lp Set. If this does not necessarily surpass the Scherchen in terms of performance, it is indeed the finest performance we have in Stereo. Unfortunately Russian Disc has totally botched the sound in their transfer. The 2 Lp set which was on Columbia/Melodiya some 20-25 years ago, had much much nicer sound. Fortunately, an alternative CD transfer exists on the Locked In The Vault Label ( Cat # 50 ), which is far superior to this Russian Disc disaster, and also a step or two above the old Columbia/Melodiya Lp set as well!! For details, email lani_spahr@yahoo.com"
3,Half an album,"I'm going to disagree with the other glowing reviews in that this album is half completed work and half scraped together samples. Literally, half the content is salvaged takes, padding on both ends of the track and samples used in the other tracks. A 30 second preview doesn't necessarily reveal this, but listening to the album several times will.The half that is polished is very nice. I'd happily bump up the overall rating if the track list was halved. I really like several of the individual songs, which I suspect is why others have rated the album so highly. Songs like Ghettoblaster Intro, Baleboste, and You Are Never Alone are well blended soundscapes.Overall, I like the artist and music enough to repeatedly listen, and will likely pick up his other album at some point, but I don't think I'll continue to listen to the album as a whole, rather selected songs."
4,Good Read,"Two weeks before the divorce he never wanted becomes final, Lucio Cruz receives a phone call from his brother-in-law Dante. His estranged wife has been ill and has been asking for him. He rushes home to find that Anabella doesn't remember the last 5 years...she still thinks they're about to elope instead of already being married. Plus she has a secret that caused her to push for the divorce in the first place.There was one thing I had an issue with. Ana, at times, acted like a spoiled brat and I just wanted to tell her to grow up and stop acting so childish. Lucio, on the other hand, was a great hero. He loved her so much that he wanted her to be happy...even if it meant her divorcing him. But the minute he heard she needed him, he was there for her immediately.Mad"
3,What is the secret of the latin lover's wife?,"Argentinean wine tycoon Lucio Cruz is not expecting the call that summons him to his estranged wife's side. She's suffering a partial loss of memory, and Lucio discovers that she's returned to being the fiery, affectionate girl with whom he once eloped. Suddenly he can't resist her - but he knows he must. In just a few weeks, their divorce will be final....Unless Ana can recall a secret that could change both their lives..."
4,Useful and interesting overview on EU Enlargement process,"I use this book as part of the literature for a graduate course on EU Enlargement. I find it well-written, informative and I especially like the historical context, of how the 'rules for EC enlargement' were created over time: It shows that many problems and issues of current EU Enlargement were issues and problems of previous enlargements as well. I also liked the clear explanation of the strong linkages between widening and deepening of EU integration over time, and how each enlargement more or less strongly affected the existing EC MS. The book is not very technical and I'd definitely recommended it for students of political economy, economics and political science!"
5,keyboard is now clean!,"This is great wish I had it years ago, should come with every computer purchase!"
2,Dangerous Product?,"The warning on this product states, ""do not get on hands."" It's a keyboard cleaner. Seems odd. I would stay away."
2,okay keyboard cleaner,This is an okay keyboard cleaner. But same thing could be done with a box of Q-tips and some alcohol for under a dollar. This item is way overpriced for what it does.update 5/24/2012I am changing my rating to 2 stars. This item is overpriced useless junk. Fortunately Amazon's refund policy allowed me to get a full refund.
4,"Does a good job, but wears out quickly.","It does a good job of cleaning the tops and sides of the keys. The more abrasive white part did a particularly nice job of getting two year's of oil and dirt residue off of the surface of the keys without damaging the letters. As others have said, it's pointless to expect this to get stuff that's down below the keys. My only concern is that the red foam ends took a real beating by the time I had used it for the entire keyboard. It looks to me like I'll get, perhaps, four cleanings out of the red end pads before they are too ragged to use. Still, it's not all that expensive, so that's not a huge deal. Heck, if I waited another two years before cleaning my keyboard again, I guess it would last a long time, but now that I have it, I'll use it more. Anyway, I'm satisfied overall. If you're looking to clean up that keyboard and get all that dirt off the keys, this will do the job well."
5,Great Product,"I really wondered if I was wasting my money but found this to be a great little product. The kit contains a scrubbing pad, some cleaning liquid and some drying cloths. The side scrubber is great for cleaning the surface of the keyboard and the two ends of the tool are shaped to fit over individual keys so you can scrub their sides. Using it is about a exciting as flossing your teeth. It did a great job of cleaning my keyboard."
5,Keyboard looks like new !,"This cleaning kit is great - it helped me get my 5 year old keyboard looking like it did the day I bought it. The scrubbing brush and foam tips work beautifully scrubbing the tops of the keys clean, as well as the sides of the keys and the spaces between them. Thiproduct actually exceeded my expectations ani I highly recommend it."
3,Only one cleaning inside..,"This kit works fine, but don't expect to get a bunch of cleanings out of it. There's enough solution to do multiple cleanings, but the cleaning tool provided is pretty much toast after one use. Definitely a disposable."
5,excellent cleaner,"This little gizmo worked great with the cleaner for my keys. In fact, the cleaner got almost all of my greasy palm prints off the lower part of the keyboard, when I thought those stains were permanent. Excellent product."
5,It really works!,"I have an mac with a white keyboard.When I saw the box, and the cleaning device, I was skeptical.Much to my surprise and delight, it made my keyboard look like new, and it hardly took any time or effort. It was really easy. I highly recommend it.A little goes a long way, so it should last you a long time."
4,works but,works like it should but it seems that the liquid cleaner might leave residue because the dust seems to stick more. But the tool fits the keys perfectly.
4,keyboard cleaner,I used this keyboard cleaner as directed and it really worked very well. It kept my keys from getting stuck.
4,screen cleaner,I used the cleaner on my TV's and monitors. It seemed to work just fine. The screens are still clean.
2,How 'Bout a Little Burning and Itching?,"I really expected a better product for the high price you pay for Anthony Logistics Hair Gel. This stuff has an odd, overpowering smell that you notice ALL DAY. Worse, however, is that as the day went on, my scalp burned and itched. I haven't used this gel in two days, and my scalp is still itching (very unusual for me).I can't use this product. This was, for me at least, a waste of $15.00. Furthermore, even if the product had been pleasing, 4 ounces is a tiny amount for the high cost."
4,Very good on the whole,"The flip-out prongs are very handy. Makes the unit fit more nicely in a pocket, etc.It gets 4 rather than 5 stars because it makes the same stupid mistake that nearly every charger cord does of putting the main body of the unit right on top of the charging prongs oriented parallel to the prongs, which means it will definitely take up more than one outlet on a power strip or any side-by-side group of outlets."
2,"One worked, one didn't","These come two to a package. Made in China. One worked fine. One didn't seem to work at all. It is nice to have a spare charger, one at home, one at work."
5,Best yet!,"I haven't yet found an Abrahams book I didn't like! This may very well be his best work so far. Like ""The Fan"" and his other books, this one's hard to put down.The plot does take unexpected twists and turns but never once did I feel I was suspending my disbelief. Nick Petrov is likable and evokes a sadness given the state of his life. It's amazing how Abrahams can get into the heads of a variety of characters from baseball players to exotic dancers to private investigators making them all convincing.A must read."
2,struggling,"3/4 of the way through and am just starting to be curious...I hate to not finish a book so i'm determined! I read thru half with nothing gripping me. I was getting annoyed that nothing seemed to be happening....started thinking 'am I missing something?"" will finish hoping for a big bang...."
4,Another EW recommendation,Good story. I'd like to read other books by this author. I'm kind of resenting being told how many more words I have to add to this review.
2,Disappointed,"I probably shouldn't have picked this book right after reading ""Nerve Damage"", which I thought was a pretty interesting (until the end) book. I believe about 25% of this book is about the same as ""Nerve Damage"". The main characters both dying, both with rare cancers yet somehow don't follow their treatment (despite not wanting to die), lie about their condition to friends, other doctors [which in the case of Oblivion, I find incredibly unbelievable that even the most incompetent doctor would not figure something out just based on a cursory physical exam]. I actually was really annoyed by that aspect of both books. The romance part, such as it was, was silly and embarrassing. It was not all bad though. I'll try another book by this guy but if it features a dying character, I won't finish it. Oh, the mystery itself - a lot of hype for something I ended up figuring out about 1/2 way through the book."
3,"Should be entitled ""Obvious.""","This book was a fun, quick read. However, I was hoping that the obvious conclusion was a red herring and that there would be a twist at the end. Not so. The ""mystery"" is clear VERY early on, and the supporting details that come later are inconsequential. Many of the clues that are planted along the way, clues that should be noticed on one's own or enjoyed once one realizes they were missed, are hammered in.The ""love story"" is entirely implausible, but worse - it is entirely disconnected from the rest of the story. And while it seems to be striving to be anti-racist, it has an uncomfortable racist leaning.If you're the kind of person who is usually surprised by the endings of mystery novels or movies, then you will really enjoy this book. It's an easy read and enjoyable."
1,Pure Torture,"This has got to be one of the worst reads I've had in quite some time. Nick Petrov gathers clues, writes down list.......has stroke.......forgets list..........begins remembering bits and pieces.......makes list from scratch.......loses list, starts over. Miraculously runs into people from his pre-stroke investigation that neatly provide all his answers. I have never felt so little for a protagonist in 40 years of reading! Sorry Peter, this was a stinker!"
3,BEWARE OF RIP-OFF SELLERS,"NEKROMANTIK is, without a doubt, one of the most nauseating horror films ever made. The budget is small, but the over-all effect is ultra-real.You will notice outrageous prices for this DVD.These people who are selling this movie for $80-$120 just don't want you to own a copy of this film.They've been sitting on this title for years.Just type-in the title and use the search engine for small, but honest stores selling this for under $20.This is a great, but sick film, but it's not worth the prices these rips are selling it for...BEWARE!"
1,buyer beware,"The way this cable is set up the vga cable is set up as an extention cable, male one end female other so when hooking up from a computer to monitor you have to use a male back to back to make it work, unless your monitor or computer has an male plug connection.For the green and blue jacks there all males ends, when hook into the computer thats ok but for the mouse and key board you can forget it unless they have female ends on there plugs.or you get some form of back to back female coupler to make it work."
5,wow,"what can i say?? this is a great book. i (being a huge raistlin fan)wanted to read this book as soon as i found out it exsisted. i rember reading chronicles, looking at raistlin and going 'here is the most intresting charicter i have ever read about.' the soulforge is about raistlin growing up as a child to taking the test in the tower of high sorcery. in this book u realize that that even as a child raistlin's best friend was his ambition. u could see how and why he became so.. dark.. in chronicles and legonds. u also see that raistlin wasn't always as dark-hearted. he wasn't born wearing the black robes, despite what many may think. in this book u see him as a, all arond ok person. he's not a saint or anything, but he isn't a bad guy either. i highly recomend this book to any dl fan, but i dont segust that any1 new to dl should read this. start with chronicles, and then legonds. that way u get to know raistlin, so to speak. i think that this is an exelent book. enjoy."
3,Wrapped In An Air Of Mystery,"Raistlin Majere has always been my favorite Dragonlance character but this story of his early years was severely lacking. Wrapped in an air of mystery and hacking away with a deadly consumption, this young mage was protected both by his powerful brother and by his cloak of mystery. His ambition, curiosity and sleight of hand earns your interest like no other but he needed a more developed background to fill that vaccuum. I will still love the red robed mage but I might have to accept that his run as a great character ended in a Summer Flame."
5,Raistlin's Background fleshed out,"This book is a retelling of younger years of Raistlin Majere, the most powerful magus of all time. It brings a much more human side to teh mage and lets the reader see how he progressed in his younger days and eventually fell under the influence of the mage Fistandantilus. I would recommend this book for anyone who is even slightly interested in the Dragonlance backstory."
5,The Truth of Raistlin Majere,This is truly the best DragonLance book (next to Legends Trilogy) for all die-hard Raistlin fans. This book answeres a majority of questions dealing with Raistlin's past that many of us (especially me) have been dying to know.I'd recommend this book for newbies and hard-core DragonLance fans.The Soulforge is definitly my #1 favorite DragonLance novel and I think you'd agree with me as well.
5,Great Story!,"I love the story of Raistlin and Caramon the most out of all the Dragonlance Tales. I really enjoyed reading of where the brothers come from, Raistlin especially. He grows from a meager little boy to a broken but very powerful wizard. The most powerful even. I recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy tales."
4,Very good but needs more Raist!,"If you are a fan of the Dragonlnace series and wish to know more about the history of Raistlin than this is a great book for you! I found myself reading this everywhere I went wanting to know what was going to happen next. I will say that the only reason I don't give it 5 starts is because I was a little let down it didn't have more about Raistlin at school and the trials/tribulations he wen through. To me it seems like they could have expanded on that piece and not had so much of the book dedicated to Caramon, Kitiara, Sturm, Tanis, Tasslehoff, and Flint. Fully realize that these other characters are important in the story to come but felt that Soulforge should have been more focused on Raist."
4,Excellent,Really good to read after you've read Chronicles because you just HAVE to know more about Raistlin!
2,A resounding eh,"I am not quite sure why people are giving this 5 stars and a perfect rating. This is nowhere near classic literature, nor is is a wonderous example of english prose.All that aside, I simply found this book slow. If you are a huge Raistlin fan, then this might have something for you. Really all you do is follow his life day by day from childhood to adulthood. Really boring and drab with about 3 pages total of action.The second book in this set was much better, and I would pick up a third if it gets written. By itself, this book doesn't really stand for itself at all. I have liked many of Weis' books, but this one is down there at the bottom of the stack."
5,The 'true' Raist,Finally the story behind the Mage is told. Margaret did a wonderful job!!!! Viva la Dragonlance!
5,"Finally, Raistlin's Test","I never knew that such a book could take over my world in a short amount of time. I mean, it started a little slow, but the reader will get into this book by the time the 2nd part is read. Must read if you have read the Chronicles and the Legends Series. Both will help you to understand little Raistlin better. Awesome book!!"
5,Pre-Chronicles Raist in a nut shell,"For anyone who read the Chronicles and wondered why Raistlin was the way he was, this is the book for you. This is like the kenders guide to raistlin because if you want to know, its in there! From age six up to after his test in the Tower at Wayreth! It is a MUST for any Raist fan! Its only the fourth DL book that I've read, but I've got that gut feeling it will be hard to match!"
5,i fit perfectly with the dragonlance story line,I bought the book and read it in a day.Raistin is my favorite character.The book is a wonderful exstension of the saga.If you enjoyed any other of the DL books read this one
5,TREMENDOUS,This book answered many questions i had about the darksouled mage Raistlin. If you dont think this is the best Dragonlance book ever than your a gully dwarf!
5,Fizban's Book Review,"In the book The Soulforge, by Margret Weis, Raistlin Majere has battled through every bit of his life. He barely made it through birth and is a sickly child. His twin brother Caramon, is the better liked, while Raistlin stays a home. Raistlin wants to do and become something great in life. He has been always interested in magic. One day an arch magus stops in the small town of Solace. He talks to Raistlin and sees that the young boy at the age of six has great potential. The book follows the life of Raistlin with his struggles and triumphs.I think that this book is awesome. It is the best book I have read and I will recommend it to whoever loves fantasy and who is searching for a great read. I would rate this a 10/10.Mrs. Sage's ClassBy Jordan"
