1,Garbage,"I ranked this movie with the worst movies ever made, but what can you expect when Owen Wilson is part of the cast, I don't know how he ever got hired as an actor. The plot behind this movie is among the stupidist I have ever seen and shows just how desperate hollywood is for something to dump on the public. Jack Black and Steve Martin must be getting really desperate for work to be a part of this waste of film. The writers, director and producer should all be banned from film making for life so we don't end up wasting our time watching any more of their crap! I just wish Amazon would allow a zero star rating which would be more appropriate for this thing!"
1,Don't trust the reviews!,"Not sure what movie the other reviewers are giving rave reviews about and giving four stars cause its definitely not The Big Year. This movie was horrible. I rented it based on the high ratings and ""pleasant surprises"" everyone was boasting about and was more than disappointed. Nothing funny about this movie. Save your 3.99."
1,"Delusional portrayal of ""Real"" Americans.","Not only was this bad it was really bad. Poor acting, poor story and too long.What I find entertaining about this little gem of a movie is that every last problem the characters have, can be solved with copious amounts of money, and driving.Rubbish like this portrays a way of life that does not really exist, thankfully the characters in this movie were either wealthy New York ad executives, or had their Daddy cover the costs of their fun when they are 36 years old. I marvel at the level of delusion in this film. Since I am not a wealthy executive I am now out of $3.99, money that would have been better used if thrown in the street."
4,Not just for the Bird's,"I skipped this movie when it was released in the theatres. The whole premise of a comedy revolving around bird watching just sounded dull. But I ended up renting The Big Year from Netflix and discovered it was fun and entertaining.You can read the plot summary for yourself on Amazon. The movie really isn't about bird watching, but rather is about how each of the three main characters, Jack Black, Owen Wilson and Steve Martin, manage a crossroad in their lives while competing in ""The Big Year"", birding's equivalent of the Super Bowl. Many high jinks unfold as do spectacular outdoor backdrops as the three crisscross the country in search of elusive sightings of birds like the Pink Footed Goose and the Snowy Owl. Although a comedy, the movie has its tender moments as each character wrestles with how their obsessive ""hobby"" has caused hardship and loneliness for those closest to them."
3,Owen Wilson all American Guy..... if you dont like him,I thought after this semi perverted girl said she was sick of him. Not like Owen Wilson would be like ( thinking of an all american female counterpart) not liking then it occured to me their really isant any female counterpart all american girl... She is gonners finished. a distant cousin of Mother Mary. I guess protestants have the ideal man in Jesus maybe superman but no ideal woman like the Virgin Mary
2,Pretty lame plot,"I fell asleep on this one. There is no plot other than who gets to see the most birds. Since it has good actors, it was enough to keep me somewhat interested in watching it. But, overall, it was pretty boring."
1,horrible,"This takes one of the funniest humans ever born, Steve and completely neuters him. That alone is a remarkable achievemet in filmmaking. The usually manic Jack Black is somnambulant and Owen Wilson's trademark smarm is kept on a nauseating ""keep warm"" setting. The result is a bland, endless, harmless comedy-in-name-only. The filmmakers also take a Smurf/Smurfette view of the world: birds are almost exclusively male, with one exception, and, you guessed it, she is there to mate with a male lead. Oh, and there's Anjelica Huston piloting a boat. I would pay good money to have this erased from my brain."
5,Big fun,Great to watch at home. Good messages mixed with humor. I would let my kids watch it and see if they pick up the same message I did. Bird watchers are like golfers Your on the honor system.
4,Funny,Great movie and wonderful characters. This film was funny but the plot was not what I was expecting.Not big on birds
4,"the book was great, this version is really pretty good.","We have 3 great actors working with some good material. Even if you know nothing about birding, this is an enjoyable movie."
4,Entertaining,"I liked it. Not the greatest movie I ever saw but it kept me entertained. I never got bored and, trust me, I've watched plenty of other ""better"" movies where I kept glancing at the clock in hopes they would be over soon. Not so with this one. A little silly, mildly humorous, not hilarious, nothing profound, but good clean fun anyway."
5,What's not to love?,"Jack Black, Own Wilson, Steve Martin and the hunt to spot the most birds! All wrapped up to make a great movie. Funny and heart-warming without being cliche. This movie made me want to read the book. Glad I finally bought it! :) Great condition and speedy delivery."
4,Surprisingly entertaining,"This movie really surprised me. My wife is a birder, currently working on a backyard Big Year, and so was eager to see it. I can't tell a Pacific from a Winter Wren and have never been a particular fan of Steve Martin's ""wild and crazy guy"" shtick, so I fully expected to dislike it. I was wrong. This is a very nicely done film about family, friends and priorities. That could be boring, but not here. It doesn't hurt that it was filmed in some stunning locations. A few of the bird models were a bit unbelievable, but the rest of the cast was very convincing. This movie deserved a much better box office reception than it received."
5,This movie always lifts my spirits!,This movie lifts my spirits every time I watch it! An excellent story with engaging characters. I was pleasantly surprised that the story as well as the humor was on the mature side (and not the sort of childish gross-out stuff we get so often these days). A five star film and a new favorite of mine!
5,Near Perfect Film,Wonderful film about three men whose lives are interwoven by the passion they share for birding. Incredible scenery and an expertly written narrative on the lives of birds will captivate viewers. The final lesson of pursuing one's dreams at the cost of losing your loved ones is strongly punctuated by the choices each character must make in the film. Highly recommended.
2,I love Owen Wilson..but this was just zzzzzz,"When it comes to Owen Wilson, it's hard for me not to like a movie he does. I just didn't get this one. Overall it was slow, boring, and most importantly just not funny. Come on Owen, you can do better!"
3,Not really a comedy.,"This movie is not really comedic, unless you are laughing at the irony of what's going on in it (people dropping their life savings to travel all over the US for 365 days to see birds). I don't hate the concept, and the cast was likeable, but it did miss the mark for me. I had high hopes since the rest of the reviews on here were high, but it is not a 4 or 5 star movie. It's a 3 star movie, one that you probably won't love but won't hate spending a couple hours of your time on. Don't go into this looking for a ton of laughs, there are actually some pretty dramatic moments (like when Bostick keeps leaving his wife). Steve Martin was probably the best part, and Jack Black was fun too."
1,Congratulations are in order.,Congratulations are in order to all the people involved with making this film. They managed to get three of the funniest people in the world and make them look like unfunny idiots of the worst kind. This movie is not funny. it is boring and a waste of good talented people.
2,Two Thumbs DOWN,"I've seen plenty of TV used car commercials that were funnier. The plot, if you can call it that, is trite, contrived and boring."
3,The Big Year - Enjoyable,"I enjoyed watching this movie late one evening with my husband. While it will not make my ""top ten"" list, I loved the actors, story, and would recommend it to my friends."
3,Ho Hum not ha ha,"When I heard about this movie I said,"" got to see it! With Steve Martin and Owen Wilson it has to be good."" So I sat down to watch it expecting to laugh a lot. I kept waiting for the funny but by the end it was just ho hum. Oh well."
3,"OK, but not worth the above average price","This movie was OK, but why is it priced above average??? I didn't find anything special about it. It falls in line with any Steve Martin movie, and also with movies like Grumpy (and Grumpier) old men."
3,"Entertaining, but nothing special","My husband and I thought this was going to be very funny based on the reviews, but it fell flat. We both agreed that it was enjoyable, but there wasn't anything overly funny or special about it."
3,The Big Year,"When my grandchildren came to visit they insisted that I would ""love, love"" this movie. They had already seen it several times and wanted me to watch it again with them. It had a positive theme but I did not enjoy it nearly as much as they did on their third viewing."
2,Not funny!,"With the actors involved, how could this not be funny. I love comedy as much as you (sense of humor). I didn't laugh one time e.g. boring. The movie does take on an interesting trip e.g. ak and other places. Boring script/plot. Good day sir!"
3,Mildly funny,"Don't expect to get any big guffaws from watching this. The main thing I kept asking myself throughout this flick was, ""Do people really travel back and forth across the US chasing birds? If I had the money to do that, I think I would find better thiings to spend my money on."" Anyway, on my scale of 1 to 10, 5 being ""Very forgettable,"" this is a solid 4.5."
2,Slow Bird,Good story line but not very interesting. Hard to keep my attention.Not much comic which is strange with Jack Black and Steve Martin
3,Doesn't fit 2002 Dodge Ram 1500,"This product doesn't fit a 2002 Dodge Ram 1500 its to small to install directly, and wont fit into the plastic housing. It was fast shipping and in good sound shape just not the right fit."
5,Works perfectly.,This did the job. We have a number of brocures.. trifold that we need to keep at the public easy to reac. They did the job.
4,"If you are going to buy 1 Warped Tour Doc, this is it!!","Hey, I've seen them all too and this one is by far the best! It's loaded with great bands, some of the best music including complete songs and insider-interviews that the others just do not have. Watching it feels like you have a backstage pass to all that is WARPED! Sound quality is better than many of the other documentaries as well. Set-up the big-screen, turn-up the volume and relive the Warped Tour in your own living room. This is a really fun video documentary to watch over and over again. Stay Warped Everyone!!"
5,Great and from the heart,"A really well-done, not typical documentary that gets to the heart of the performers, the audience, and their world. Good live performances are captured as well. I really enjoyed it and recommend it."
3,Behind the Headline,"As much as I enjoyed the cook as catalyst, solving the mystery while dealing with family and professional issues, there were too many pungent ingredients to create a smooth broth. Longer bits that take us from place to place within the scene would blend the exaggerated flavors."
3,Deadly Birthday,"THE BODY IN THE SNOWDRIFT by Katherine Hall Page is not the best of this culinary series, but it is okay.A weekend with in in-laws is never fun, but skiing in Vermont has a special touch. Faith Fairchild is prepared to make the best of the situation until she finds a body in a snowdrift and from there matters get worse.Fun read for fans.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS."
3,track listing for this limited edition,"whoever wrote the track listing up above must've been amping pretty hard. this disc is a two-cd edition (i.e. includes a bonus disc with some re-mixes of the songs on disc 1).01) black gloves02) british mode03) girl04) bring it down05) slow down06) check07) modern vision08) 3T409) low mode10) everybody11) safari beachbonus track: AUDIENCEBONUS CD1) black gloves (ft Marcus Graap)2) british mode (Jester Remix)3) bring it on (Tronik Youth Edit)4) everybody (dub)5) masters on topit's got a steady dance beat with an edgy synth riding over a lot of it, vocals remind me of remixed depeche mode style vocaling. slightly industrial sounding, but with enough of a rock steady dance beat to keep you involved."
1,"Too much Gulf War Illnesses, not enough military history","I'm sorry to say, but this CD-ROM is simply disappointing from a military-historian point of view. 545 MBytes of the 576 MBytes of data is an off-line version of the GulfLINK web page, which is focused on the Gulf War Illnesses. The remaining data are some interviews, some maps, some photos/artwork and the electronic version of ""The Whirlwind War"". For a CD-ROM that is centred on the history of the Gulf War this is simply not enough. There is another edition from the same publisher centred only around the Gulf War Illnesses for those who seek such information, so there was no need to recycle this data here on this CD-ROM and leave out all those other official important documents about the history of the Gulf War."
2,Not like the girl,"I don't think this book is nearly as strong as Ebershoff's The Danish Girl. I loved the Danish Girl and can't wait for his new book, but this collection didn't do it for me at all. And I am a huge short story fan. You might want to check out Marissa Silver's short story collection instead."
2,"Some good stories, some rambling.","I enjoyed several of the stories in this book. However, many of them were also very pointless and just ramblings that I think were supposed to be poignant, but really weren't. I don't regret buying it, but I'm not going to regret selling it off either."
4,Mileage Plus Program,"Montana Moore, 35 yr. old flight attendent in her prime - pressured to arrive at her sister's Christmas Eve party with her future husband.Mr. Talbert (playwright author) in his debut novel has given us a hilarious story about Montana's quest before Christmas Eve. She has several candidates that she's considering - Quinton Jamison (a sugar daddy multimillionaire who's twenty years older; Reverend Curtis P. Merewether (a Holy Ghost Pastor); Langston Jefferson Battle III (city councilman); Damon Diesel, (a Puff Daddy wannabe); - but will any of these fit the bill???? Or is there someone who Montana just hasn't considered as a prospect?The pressure is on - Montana has ""one"" month and thousands of air miles to solve her problem, with a constant reminder from her sisters and mother that females should be married by age thirty.The humor and laughs in the story is outrageous! It was enjoyment to read this tale."
1,Disappointed over the friendly skies,"Believe it or not, this book was listed as a Christian Romance! If you are not easily offended, this book may entertain you. Montana is trying to get married to please her mother, and she will sleep with just about anything! Her fellow flight attendant enjoys inappropriately rubbing male customers to make them ""happy"" and another friend is a he-male, they all use horrid language and insult each other frequently. I was sorry I paid money for trash like this and I wanted to warn other readers what is lurking in these pages!"
2,I knew the end of this story before i finished it,I was horrible and knew it would be so someone please tell me why i bought this. Man i'm upset
3,Awww,I thought this book was so sweet and ended on a happly ending. Montana is inside of all of us if you let it happen. Must Read
1,False information,The item is described in two separate areas as being made of a die cast metal case. This is not true. It is chrome plated. I brought this to Amazon's attention and got the brush off. This will be my last purchase from Amazon.
4,Guess I've Just Plain Grown Used to Stanley Tape Measures,"I really don't consider myself an old time construction man yet... But I have been using Stanley 30' Tapes for 26 years now. Nothin else feels right. Even when Stanley came up with bigger and better, the Powerlock 30' is what I buy and will continue to buy, for a good piece of time to come. The only reason I gave this tool just 4 Stars is that I can beat tools up pretty bad and they just CAN'T last forever. Stanley will give ya a good run for your money though."
3,It leaks from the lid,"Convenient with a handle on the mug, keeps my coffee hot/warm for 2 -3 hrs, easy to wash and clean the lid -- these are expected from reading reviews.But it leaks from the lid while walking with it in my hand -- major inconvenient. Also, the mug feels hot when the coffee is hot."
3,Timolino PAB-46GRE travel mug,"Convenient shape, good handle; but doesn't hold temperature as long as I would like on a long trip. Good for short commute or errands around town. Fits cupholder well."
5,Great small tape rule,I love that it is well-made and has an easy power lock. It is smaller than the one it replaced.
2,Not Good Enough,"I am a buyer for a small manufacturing plant. Unfortunately, this item does not last long enough in a commercial setting. We prefer Stanley's 33-512, but they discontinued that item. Should be good enough for home use, but not good enough in a manufacturing setting where it is used several times five days per week."
1,Broke after only one month,"I bought this tape measure before moving into my new apartment, and it worked great at first. Very sturdy-feeling, and nice and compact. After a mere 4-5 weeks of moderate use (just a few times for furniture placement), the locking mechanism no longer locks on this tape measure, rendering it nearly useless. How ironic that they call this shoddy product ""power-lock""! If only they made them like they did in the good old days. Do not buy this poorly-made tape measure. I expected more from a supposed quality name like Stanley!"
3,A bit misleading...,"I bought these to replace a pair of non-greaseable bushings, but they were not quite what I was hoping they would be. I expected a zerk on them to actually be able to inject them with grease when I do regular maintenance on my truck; however, there was no grease fitting, but a packet of grease that is to be applied at initial installation. This means that to grease them in the future, I would have to take them off the sway bar, which defeats the whole purpose. I already had a good set of poly bushings, so I was a bit disappointed, but they are an excellent product and upgrade from stock or worn out bushing. Hope that helps..."
2,Need deeper cut,"I've read the book and attended a seminar and walked away with sad feeling because the book/seminar do not cut deep enough to provide any real change. Methodism worked 300 years ago in a specific time and place in the history. As the saying goes, 'You can never step into the river twice!' However, the book does give an overall picture on the current state of Methodist Church."
4,Good story...,"I personally really enjoyed reading the book. I read it AFTER I watched Munich and I wish I had dome the opposite. I twas a bit long and I feel like the story went into painful detail about the simplest things, but for some, that is needed. I often felt like skipping some pages here and there. I feel bad saying that because it's a wonderful story and tells a great perspective on a troubled time. It is well worth the read. As for it's legitimacy, I wasnt alive when all this happened but based on the intricate and pailful detail of some of the stories, it seemed pretty true I guess. Never know, some people have great imaginations."
5,"Avner is now President of Interfor, Inc.","I had a chance to meet Major Aviv, ""Avner"" in the book and the head of the Israeli counter-terrorist unit. He now specializes in tracking down foreign assets stolen by bad guys. It was surreal reading about blowing up a terroist in Paris in the morning and then sititng down with a charming and humorous man. Good book. Tough job."
3,interesting but not too different,this book is almost identical to other books on the munich massacre and the israeli operations. if you have one book on the event and were looking towards this as an addition think twice.
4,a good read,"Interesting book. It's a behind the scenes story of how an Isreali counterterror team operated while avenging the killings at the Munich Olympics. I read the book in about three days, and it was hard to put down. I recommend this book to anyone interested in the workings of a Mossad team, or counterterror operations in general."
5,A better way to deal with terrorism??,"Jonas's book is an engaging account of a special unit formed under the unofficial auspices of the Mossad to track and kill the people they determined were responsible for the Munich massacre of Israeli athletes in 1972.This book is an especially important read after 11 September. That this 5-man unit was able to eliminate 8 terrorist leaders with no ""collateral damage"" in a little over two years is something I hope our security agencies will take to heart."
3,Fascinating,The only concerns of course is the validity of the sources. Needs to be cross referenced with another publication or account. But overall very detailed and easy narration.
1,Beware - this book is a hoax by a known fabricator!,"This book has repeatedly been determined to be a hoax by a known, prolific fabricator named Yuval (or Juval) Aviv. An investigation by the British newspaper The Guardian determined: ""Aviv never served in Mossad, or any Israeli intelligence organisation. He had failed basic training as an Israeli Defence Force commando, and his nearest approximation to spy work was as a lowly gate guard for the airline El Al in New York in the early 70s. The tale he had woven was apparently nothing more than a Walter Mitty fabrication.""This a competently done hoax, but a hoax nonetheless. For the real story, read ""STRIKING BACK."""
3,vengeance:the true story of an israeli counter terrorist team,Good read. Very detailed. I recommend it.
1,Phonier than a Three Dollar Bill,"Complete trash written by a guy who used a pathelogical liar as a source. The entire extent of the source's experience in operations for Israeli security was working for El Al, the Israeli national airline screening passengers and luggage."
5,BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Fantastic reading - true story.I made the sad and sorry mistake of loaning book to a friend, who loaned it to a friend, and then freaking LOST it. Damn!!!!! Great book!"
4,Best Espionage book I've read,"Great read. Very propulsive - and immersive, despite having been written via ghost-writer. Excellent insights into the Israel-Palestine quagmire, and great stories about how great counterterrorism is executed.Also, for what it's worth, if you've seen the movie 'Munich', read this book. If you haven't seen the movie - don't - and read this book. If you've read the book and haven't seen the movie, don't.I can't fathom what Spielberg was thinking when he directed this, but I really feel that he sapped the life out of the book while trying to amplify the drama that the Mossad agents went through."
4,"Thrilling, Intriguing and probably true","Am interested in military topics and have always admired Israeli military teams. Remember the day of the Munich massacre well, like Sept 11 and decided to give this book a try. It is exciting and very eye opening. Some of it reads like a novel but the claim is that it is true so I assume it is. It is a story of intrigue, of the incredible commitment of individuals to a cause, of the underworld of counter espionage and the workings of large organizations such as a country like Israel and what happens in the end ... worth the read"
3,A good read but seems sensationalized.,"Jonas still maintains that his primary source for this book, a man who goes by the psyeudonym ""Avner"", told him a true story when he decribed his exploits as leader of an Israeli hit team in the 1970s. Senior Mossad leaders, past and present, do not deny the operation described in the book took place, but many deny Avner's involvement. That's understandable whether his story is true or not. There are minor discrepancies in details here and there, when compared with other accounts, but in the main Jonas' story seems to hold up. Regardless, the book is certainly readable - you won't find it boring. I've done my own research and have not found any definitive sources who can refute Avner's tale, but in fairness I've not yet read Aaron Klein's book Striking Back which I'm told is more accurate."
4,Vengeance: the true story of an Israeli counter-trerrorist team,"The author deatails Israel's response ot the 1972 Munic Olympic murder of the nation's athletes by Palestinians. The book provides an abundance of information regarding the political origins of this revenge killing, the toll it took on the members of the team, the role of the U.S.S.R. in supporting the Palestian cause, and the group in-fighting within the Palestinian movement. The author's thoroughness leads to some redundacy which causes a degee of tedium in reading. The reader, however, is rewarded by reading through these few sections by experiencing the intensity of the reaction by the group's leader as he has to deal internally with the reality of his and their task. The fact that three of the group members are killed in this persuit of the Palestinaian leaders behind the Munich murders adds to the the books central figure's emotional stress."
2,If it wasn't for the end.,"This album has some pretty good songs, but when I said some I mean four - six and that's not even the half of album's 12 songs. But that's not the big problem. All the bad songs is in the end of the album and all the good one in the begining. That's why I don't like it so much."
5,abba lover,"This album was amazing when it came out in the 80's, and sounds even more amazing on th CD. The songs are beautiful and timeless and I wore out the tape when I had it-let's see how long this CD lasts... :)"
3,I'm Angela,"I would just like to give a more personal review. I'am the person who plays the character Angela. I was 7 at the time and I'am now 17. I enjoyed every minute of being a part of an experience such as this. The book has a great message to all kids who feel discouraged just because they feel ""different""."
4,good stuff,I used to listen to this albun a coupple years ago and always liked it. I finally bought it again and I am sooo glad I did. It's good music for road trips and rocking out to. I definitely recommend buying it.
5,"No moving parts, but plenty of metal",Rather impressive considering that it's the same size as its peers ...The shape is very menacing.
4,Everything you need to know about DV,"Many people have praised this book and I do also. This is a must have book for digital (I recommend reading it with Feature Filmmaking at Used-Car Prices : How to Write, Produce, Direct, Shoot, Edit, and Promote a Feature-Lenth Movie for Less Than $15,000 by Rick Schmidt)And though I don't mean to discourage anyone from buying it, I have to say that the editing section Chapter 8 is confusing.I wish the author had taken the approach--here's how I do it and then followed his own path, then suggested other starting points and gone through those. What he did was put a whole lot of stuff that apply to a whole lot of different methods in a big jumble without any hint of how to follow them (or if you should follow them) to the end.The rest of the book is great, though an index would have helped."
2,Not Worth It,"I was gravely disappointed by this book. A large portion of it is wasted talking about movie making in general-- how to work with writers, write a good script, etc. A small portion provided a small portion of the information I had expected--technical information about the 'digital' part. It is poorly written and poorly edited."
1,Utter garbage!,"Whoa! Let's drop some of those stars, and quickly. This tinkly treacly pretensious junk is exactly the kind of pianistic trash that jazz lovers have nightmares about. I heard of this album by accident through an Amazon cross-reference from a Charlie Haden album, and I was seduced by the rave reviews I saw. Just goes to prove how unreliable Amazon reviews can be. Will I ever learn? Sure, this might be to your taste. My advice is: don't buy before giving a listen. It'll make you nostalgic for George Winston."
3,Lamp review,"I really fell in love with this lamp and thought carefully before ordering it. The design of it is delightful and it was easy to put together. But the three-way aspect of the switch does not work. Unfortunately, I found this out after disposing of the packing materials, making it much more complicated to return (it's big). So I am keeping it and living with it the way it is. It works just fine with any bulb, it just does not switch a three-way bulb properly. So that's a little disappointing. Otherwise, it shipped and arrived quickly and in good shape, etc."
5,Added attraction,"Recently redecorated the spare bedroom with reds, blacks and bronze tones and needed that extra punch that a unique lamp can add. This artistic piece is that special addition that sets everything else off and helps it all work together. Many raves on the shape and the beautiful red shade. Love it! Thanks Amazon for offering such variety."
3,"Cute, whimsical, over-priced lamp","I thought I'd gotten a good bargain on this lamp for 62 dollars (it's currently 125 - they've got to be kidding), but the quality is not at all what I'd hoped for. It is really cute, but I'll be using it in my office, not my home. The quality is borderline - like most mass produced stuff today. The shade is a very pretty ruby red, with tan threaded scrolls, but hot glue is showing in spots and it's a bit 'off' on one side. Based on the photos and description, I was expecting much higher quality - honestly pretty disappointed since I've been watching it for months, waiting for a price drop. Much nicer lamps can be had for half what I paid for it. Cute enough to keep for office use, but would not recommend or order again. Luckily I held off on ordering the floor lamp until I received the table lamp - will not be ordering that."
3,Nice lamp...but,"The lamp arrived today. Finally. Took over a week. Packaged nicely and it's a lovely lamp. For the price I thought it should be heavier, but I like it and therefore will keep it. Ordered the recommended light bulb to go with it. GE Energy Smart 3-way bulb. Not sure why that was suggested to go with the lamp since I was unable to put the shade on with it in place because it was too tall for the product. But then, I got the desk lamp and perhaps it fits the floor lamp. Would have been nice to have that specified. However, found another place to put the Energy Star 3-way bulb. Do note that this shade is burgandy. A very deep burgandy. And note the gold scrolls on the shade. They do not show up so well on the picture. Frankly, I liked them but they are not for everyone so note that the shade is not a solid color."
4,Lovely table lamp,The table lamp is very pretty. I love the color of the lamp shade and the scroll design on the body of the lamp.Very nice!
3,The shade is too big,"The lamp came in a size a lot bigger than the impression given on the web site picture. The shade is extremely big. Nevertheless the style of the base meets my expectation on the product; I had to change the shade to make it look right for me. I recommend amazon to provide dimension and size of this product in more details, so that the buyer will have a realistic assessment of this product."
4,A True Classic,"Definitely an album everyone wanted back in 1970, especially with the rich texture of the LP cover. Only weak spots are Teach Your Children and Our House, both by Graham Nash, by far the weakest member of the group."
5,Simply Great !,This album's songs are as great as I remember them. Still move me tremendously and really fit the times of today.
4,Neil Young's work makes this music timeless,"I listened this music a great deal when it was first released. I was tempted to purchase the cd over the last few years but couldn't get past the fact that some of the music/lyrics have badly dated (especially ""Almost Cut My Hair"" and ""Woodstock"").Neil Young's ""Country Girl"" always struck me as the best song on the album. I heard it again at a music store listening post last year (probably for the first time in over twenty-five years) and it sent chills up my spine. I only hope that he finally includes it in his long awaited career retrospective that he's been tinkering around with for over five years. So much good material was left off his first retrospective (which is now over twenty years old) that it would be nice to have this song, and many others that he did early and later in his career."
5,WOW- How did I miss this?,"What an unbelievable album. I was just looking for one song on this album and after sampling a few of the other songs, I took a chance and bought the album. I was blown away! I don't own any other Crosby, Stills &Nash; so I wasn't sure what to expect. It's like the very best of 70's music- without the silliness or any of the other extremes. Very mellow yet full of passion. Lyrics are awesome,- you can understand everything they say- and they have a lot of good stuff to say.You will Love this album, but it and play tracks #6 and 9 first."
4,A timeless classic,"Had this album in vinyl ... it's a great classic with plenty of great songs. A must for Crosby, Still, Nash and Young fans of all ages."
3,Sum of the parts...,"With the Beatles, the whole was greater than the sum of the parts. Here, I'm afraid, the opposite is true. On this pretentious catastrophe of an album, two ""great"" (??) bands collide, the drippy and mellifluous Crosby Stills & Nash and the astringent-voiced faux yokel Neil Young. Adding to the confusion, one of the best songs on the album, ""4 + 20,"" is channeling pure Paul Simon and one of the worst, ""Everybody I Love,"" is a watered down version of watered-down-white-boy-Three-Dog-Night-style soul. I love this album, despite its obvious defects, for the timeless ""classic rock"" hits (e.g., ""Carry On"" and ""Woodstock"") but perhaps most of all for its early 1970s hippie turned farmer nostalgia value (""Country Girl...""). A solid two stars. Or three. At *MOST* four. All these five star reviewers need to pass me the bong..."
2,Sorry: I'm an honest hippie,"Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young are the answer to the riddle: WHO is the only group that wondered, ""by whom could we do something really... 'heavy?,' and answered... Joni Mitchell?"" Have a nice day!"
3,Am I only one who HATES the song Almost Cut My Hair?,"Don't get me wrong - I like the rest of the album - but I absolutely cannot stand that song!! It sounds so stupid, pathetic, and whiny!! Oh, so you almost cut your hair? Well, boo-hoo, cry me a river!! Why don't you?"
5,Their Best Album Of All Time!,"Deja Vu is CSN's best album. A big reason of this is Neil Young. CSN were great together, but when they joined with Young, the possibilities were endless. This album shows that. Crosby wrote two great songs on the album; Almost Cut My Hair and Deja Vu. Graham Nash also wrote some great songs, including one of the best songs they ever did, Teach Your Children, and also Our House. Stills and Young really shine on this album, collaborating on the great Everybody I Love You. Individually, Stills wrote such classics as Carry On and 4 + 20. Young wrote Country Girl, which is a great song, but Helpless may just top the album as the best song on it. With these four incredible songwriters on one album, how did they ever find room for Joni Mitchell's Woodstock? I don't know, but I'm glad they did, because it is a great song. This album is very essential to any fan of any of the four artists."
5,Short and sweet,"As a 46 year old, to all you younger ones curious, well, its good and like the music you listen to today, you just have to be there - the time and the music are just so intertwined. Enjoy."
1,Lights like pizza delivered with a bite taken out of it,"I've got 3-way table lamps that can't accomodate 3-way fluorescent energy-saving lights, so I jumped at these when I saw that they included harp extensions for lamp shades that could make the lights fit the lamps. The lights arrived today, and not only were BOTH clamshell packages for the lights that I ordered cut open and taped ""shut"", 3 of the 4 harp extensions were missing from the packages. To me, this is the equivalent of opening your pizza delivery box to discover that the pizza kitchen help ate off a few slices, tossed the remains in the box, and delivered it anyhow. I will never order from Greenfeet again...the best thing they could do is give me a refund."
5,3-way flourenscent bulbs,the bulbs arrived quickly and in good condition. It is too soon to tell the economic impact on our utility bills. We will probably get more in the future.
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED!,"This movie is good based on what it really is a fact based drama, but the cover and title imply something more like a Horror which this movie is not. So if you are looking for a traditional horror tale look elsewhere!"
5,Very interesting,"We initially started reading the paperback ""adult"" version. My girls enjoyed that, but this one is even more interesting with the pictures. Fabulous true story that we all enjoy."
4,Teriffic for Travel,I have had the VAIO TR3 for over a year. It works great especially using a wireless card. The small screen is easier to view than a dull larger one. I use it exclusively for travel and it fits my needs to a T!(Pardon the pun!) I am baffled by the poor user reviews. Just to be able to slip it into your briefcase on the fly and not to carry another case is really helpful to me. I intend to buy another one -- TR5 in the immediate future. No problems at all with my TR3.
1,Not worth it,A pathetic attempt at iPod integration. Navagation is a trial and error endeavor. It doesn't remember the last place it was playing between you turn it on/off. The screen of the iPod has a dumb Sony Xplod graphic on it so you can't even use it to find a song and then have it play through the adapter. Deeply disappointed in Sony for this shockingly bad product.
2,major bug,"Unfortunately, this Sony adapter has several bugs in its software (that it loads into the radio when attached) and one of them is major - this unit will not resume play where it stopped when the ignition was shut off; instead it always starts from the first song in the iPod. Scrolling through songs to find your old place is not fast or convenient on the radio, and thus you are pretty much left with suffle play only. Another more minor bug is that when returning from an adjustment mode, the display does not return to it's full setting until something like the display button is pressed. This kind of sloppiness is not typical of Sony when dealing with Sony products, but is Sony's typical NIH (not invented here) attitude when dealing with a rival's product."
3,iPod Resetting - Small Workaround,"OK...I'm pretty much in agreement with the rest of the reviews posted for this product on the internet. I was also becoming pretty frustrated with the fact that the iPod would reset to the first song on the first album every time I restarted my car. But after tooling around with the setup in my car I discovered that the problem is that the iPod adapter does not disconnect from the iPod when the radio is shut off. Once your radio is completely powered off (the clock is not displayed), disconnect the iPod and manually turn it off (or let it shut itself off). This works for me since I have my iPod in a very accessible place. Just reconnect your iPod before you start your car again, and music will continue from the song you left off of. Really, all Sony needs to figure out is how to have the iPod disconnect after the radio powers down."
3,Meh... It's okay when it acts right.,"I have this hooked into my sony cdx gt40w and my 3rd gen iPod nano. The scrolling is really slow and any time you change your sort category (sort by artist, playlist, genre, etc) it resets everything and goes in chronological order. With mine, it usually locks up after 30 minutes of songplay or trying to navigate too much. It was cheap and I thought it would work, but I got what I paid for instead. I'm fairly turned off by Sony products because of their inconsistency of quality."
3,not working with cdx-gt710,This unit 'works' with old iPods and old Sony receivers. My cdx-gt710 shows it connected but it throws everything out of whack. With this unit plugged in it causes the receiver not to turn on with the ignition and also causes my SAT radio to not show up as a source so I have to turn it off and on a few times before it comes up. The iPod always starts at the same beginning song (alphabetically) and it will charge the older iPods such as G1-G3 Nano's but my iPod Touch won't charge. If you have a newer receiver I would suggest buying the xa-120IP. It's newer (replaces the 110IP) and probably supports the newer units. What really brasses me off is that Sony said it would work when I asked their tech support prior to buying this unit. Grrr....
1,It has to be defective because it's Sony,"I installed this Sony iPod Adapter to my Sony BT-5100 and worked for fine for the first day; however, after that the right channel speaker didn't have any sound coming out of them. Of course I played the tuner and CD player and it played music out of both L/R channels. I've owned many Sony products, but I think this has been the first defective product I've purchased. The company told me to return it to them with a copy of the email the sent me. It seemed too good to be true for $10.00 since it's normally $50.00. I'm content with streaming music, through Bluetooth, on my Windows Smartphone XV6800. I would not recommend this product."
3,"Yes, But What Does It Mean?","All right. I've heard enough of the technical brilliance, the vision, the otherworldlines, the how-it-gets-you-there-ness better than Crimson or ELP or whomever, blah, blah, blah... And don't get me wrong, this music can be, well, transcendent. That's why I bought it after hearing the live version in concert in 1976 and about 200 times subsequently on ""Yessongs"" when I was 17. But you have to admit, that's a LOT of words, a lot of getting up and down, and, well, what about it? I don't have a clue. It was all so much clearer when Gerald Ford was President."
1,Poorly Transferred to CD,"This is almost completely unlistenable because the quality of the CD is so poor. This is true of all the YES records. They weren't transfered to CD very well. Re-mastered versions have more recently come out. I haven't heard them, but this is not worth buying and, unlike the other single-star reviewers, I LOVED this record when I was in my early 20s."
5,The Proud Sons and Daughters,"I""m inclned to agree with the majority of reviews here - this is a great remastering of a great album. Every song is a winner and is still played in concert except ""A Venture"" which really isn't a bad song just not as strong as the others. The clairty of each instrument is apparent here. I'm glad I picked this up again and it's once again a welcome addition to my collection of Yes albums."
5,The White Queen runs so fast...she must work out!,"With the joyous exuberance of youth and a symbiotic blend of volcanic musical talent to fuel them, Yes delivered thier most timeless masterwork only 3 albums into thier career. ""The Yes Album"" is one of the least pompous examples of textbook progressive music. Yes proves it is possible to produce compositions that are complex without ""showboating"", mystical and transporting without self-conscious pretension, and at times even sweet and beautiful without becoming cloying. As a jaded music fan/obsessive collector who has ""heard it all"" from ""Sugar Sugar"" to Sigur Ros, I must say that I never tire of listening to this album, and still manage to pick up new things from it after almost 30 years. If you're new to the group, this is the place to start!"
5,Mankind knows no words to reveal the true experience.,It wasn't just a fad or faze I was going thru I still love to listen to YES
4,Their best work but not quite a classic,"An excellent album indeed. The arrangements of the pieces of music(its hard to call these mere songs.) are out of this world. Much effort was put into the song-writing on this one. The instruments( including the vocals) blend in very nicely most notably Chris Squire's bass. Six numbers on an album may not punch everyone's ticket and sometimes it irks me a bit as well. However, Yes has put out a creative disc and it is a worthy purchase"
4,Why!?,"There is very little to complain about on Rhino's reissue of The Yes Album; the remastering is done well, and is nice and clear. However, I do have to fault Yes and Eddie Offord for fading out nearly every track on the album. Nothing sounds complete, and the epic nature of the songs demands resolution. A good buy, but get Keys To Ascension as well if you want to hear Starship Trooper as it was meant to be."
4,a mellow masterpiece...subtle yet powerful...,"Listen. This beautiful music pre-dates the keyboard theatrics with Wakeman...it's my fave.The guitar solos come to life on ""Disgrace"". The piano tinkles on ""Venture"". The drumming is magnificent.Great after a hard day's work.Goes with Lark's Tongues by KC (same drummer on both) as wonderful mood pieces. Buy it."
4,Starship trooping :-),"This album is sometimes underrated by the fans, because it is pre-Wakeman, but, it is one of their best nonetheless. Starship trooper is one of the best songs and fan favorite on shows, and Howe playing The Clap is outstanding."
5,Great CD,"JaBrony here,This is a great remaster. Go buy it. Mostly anything that MoFi does isusually great. Crisp clear soft highs, no forced pushed up/down bass or lows.Great disc.Get it.JaBrony out -"
5,Good Album,Another album for those that want to relive a sound of the past. Yes was a real tight band and this album has some of their really good work.
3,anonymous,This is a very good first novel. The plot is well thought out and keeps the reader interested. More information on the intelligence of the cats would have been interesting. Loved it!!
5,enjoyed,Being a retired sailor (Coast Guard) I am very interested in historical naval books. Very detailed. Good price and shipped on time.
4,LONGARM SEDUCED BY BAD WOMAN,"Yahoo! This is another fun Western yarn, with the bad guys and the good folks both claiming the same land. In this one, Marshal Longarm finds himself right in the middle of the range war, and his fellow law enforcement officer/sheriff is wanted for murder in another jurisdiction. Longarm makes a mistake in the story and ends up in the bedroom with a ruthless widow who turns out to be a cold-hearted killer. Like all in the Tabor Evans series, the story rolls right along to an exciting climax. A quick read while basking in the sun and smoking a smooth cigar (like Longarm)."
5,Excellent Service,The Bible was received before the expected time and was in excellent condition. I couldn't be happier.
3,Psychological Reports,"Book wasnt quite what I needed. That was due to my misunderstanding however, so it has nothing to do with the seller. The book came in exact expected condition and in a reasonable time frame. The price was good. The only downside was it wasnt quite the text I needed but that was my misjudgement nothing to do with the seller."
4,Nice to have metric and medieval on one tape,"This tape measure style has been in use for a very long time. They are durable and always of high quality. I specifically sought out this tape measure for its metric scale. Regrettably, they do not appear to make this tape in metric only, so I had to settle for the mixed scale. Overall, quite satisfied. Glad to finally have a tape with metric, so I can make easier measurements without having to do fraction conversions on the fly."
2,Save Your Money,Considering this album came from Blue Note I was expecting a great album and what I got was an album that had me feeling blue. This selection does not blend well. There are some high spots but with as many songs you would expect more. I personally like to buy compilation albums because of the variety that you can only find on these type cd's. But this song selection is horrible. If I worked at Blue Note I would review the long term employment future of whoever put this absurdity together. These artists on this cd have so much better material to choose from than this. If you are looking for a good compilation this is not it.Check out the series from WJJZ 106.1. This is a great series and sounds so much better.
5,Examines the communities of computer game players,"In Dungeons And Dreamers: The Rise Of Computer Game Culture From Geek To Chic by Brad King and John Borland examines the communities of computer game players that have sprung up over the last 30 years and the role the creators of the games played in forming them. Based on numerous interviews with Richard Garriott, the developer of the first commercially successful online role-playing game Ultima Online, King and Borland tell the fascinating story of the icon's start and ascent in the industry. King and Borland also profile other prominent creators and celebrity players."
4,"True fans and gamers, it's must-read material","Very enjoyable and non-heavy book stretching back to Gygax and his crew of Chainmail folks up through the current crop of MMORPG play (yeah, Carmack and Romero and all those guys are in it too). A great read and a diverse one too, in that it discusses the technical issues of game development and game play, video games in a social context and under fire from concerned activists, and also a cool look at the personal lives of the key players who introduced the games themselves, Never boring, and although it's not a super heavy read it's got definite gems of inspiration and insight. It's well written and engaging. If you're a fan, (especially if you had a C64/Atari/Pong and spent time with the 20 sided die) it's a must have. Lots of fun! I'd disregard the 1-star bad review (if you read past page 14, it gets much more interesting Kathy82...that goes for most books, btw)."
1,Misleading; authors didn't do their homework,"If you want the Wikipedia version of computer game history this is for you. If you want the truth, you're going to have to keep searching.Once again, we have the quick-and-easy blogger-style history effort at work here. Barely any mention of PLATO. Once again giving credence to Bartle's false claim to have created the first MUD.The authors do a major disservice to readers. Such a shame.This book is NOT the real history, it is not the complete history. It is the convenient history. That is not good enough."
5,A Great Album Not Just Great Songs,"MBD had been one of my favorite bands before this album came. But the one problem I always had with them is that they had great songs, but no great albums. Each album would have 2-3 amazing songs and the rest would be, well, of various quality to say the least. Kings is simply great from start to finish. If there is a week link, it's ""Deeper Down"", the song they released as a single.Overall this album flows from song to song creating a mood and atmosphere that moves from aggressive to mornful to reflective to defiant. You can't go wrong with this album."
5,Masterpiece,"I must say this is the first MDB album ive heard. Now ive gotten most of there other albums, but this is one Doomy, Heavy, Beautiful piece of music. Highly recomended for anyone who likes heavy melodic music."
2,Nothing new,"I've got a chance to listen to this album, and I'm disappointed.I listen to MDB since '93. and have all of their releases. I'm in a great dilemma if I should buy this one. If I buy it, it will be when the price of this CD drops under $10 and just for collector's reasons.After The Light at the End of the World, MDB hasn't progressed a bit. Most of the material is just copy/paste getting lousier. This album is the bottom (so far). I can find no real emotion here. No depth. No melody. It looks like the whole album was written in a week, just for fulfilling the contract obligation to the label."
2,MDB ?,"What the heck? this band as chanced and not in a good way, do not waste your money on thisbecause if you do you be will sorry"
1,Poorly Constructed...,"I have the iRiver iFP-390T which is very similar. It worked great for a while and could hold around 5 full length CD's. My problem with it is that they fall apart easily. I now have a non-working MP3 player and nothing to show for it. The warranty is only 30 days, I have had mine for around 90 days. The buttons on the top no longer work they are broken. If you push to hard or to often on them they will snap and break very easily. Save your money and get a better made and more durable MP3 player."
1,Flimsy,"I've had mine since October. I never dropped it, and always kept it in a drawer when not in use. Despite these precautions, the play button stopped working, and the casing is falling apart.Save your money and get something sturdier."
3,Pretty good little device,"I have only used this device once, however it works pretty good. In recording from an FM band which is the main reason I got it, it does a good job. At times the buttons are a bit erratic, and you do need to download the instruction manual or you will be lost. However overall I got what I wanted."
5,"Review of ""His Special Little Girl""","""His Special Little Girl"" is the most extraordinary book on incest that I've ever read, and the credibility in the book makes it undeniable. In addition, the outcome of the survivor is absolutely incredible, and the book's focus on forgiveness and hope is truly amazing. If Dr. Phil doesn't have this author on his show, I'll be very disappointed."
4,My First,"This was the first Bette Midler album I ever heard. (I checked a copy out of the library many years ago.) And since then i've been hooked on her voice and her inventive choice and interpretation of material. Stand-outs on this LP are ""Shiver Me Timbers"", ""No Jestering"", ""Tragedy"", and ""Let me Just Follow Behind."" A timeless classic from a timeless classic."
4,Songs for the new depression,A more quirky Midler album. I especially enjoyed Mr. Rockefellar and the duet with Bob Dylan.
4,I don't want this disc to end,"One of Bette's early gems. This may not be her finest album, but there is so much to recommend it that no true Bette Midler fan should be without it. My favorites on this disc are ""Old Cape Code,"" ""Mr Rockefeller,"" her classic reading of Tom Waites' ""Shiver Me Timbers"" and her irresistible duet with Bob Dylan on ""Buckets of Rain."" A great little disc."
5,Extremely pleased with purchase,"I rev'd cd in 3 days.....in perfect condition, packaged properly....couldn't ask for more.....my family would like me to stop playing it over & over again....."
1,STUPID,Saw the first third of this on a plane to the UK. Too stupid to continue. Think Pink Panther cross with James Bind but not nearly as good. Also some really off racial jokes... Forget this.
1,Kiosk Rating <1,"Doesn't even deserve the honor of being called a parody. An obvious Bond 007 takeoff that was just dumb, not funny. Had that silent movies slapstick feel in which the viewer's time is better spent in watching the originals. Slapstick was funny the first time through especially since movies were still a novelty and anything that appeared on the screen was capturing, but reruns just get old. Basically the plot is of an MI7 agent who continuously makes stupid mistakes that help the bad guys more so than if he did nothing at all. Not to be confused with, or even in the same conversation with, the Peter Sellers' Panther movies although there seems to be, politely stated, a lot of borrowing from his movies."
1,Johnny English Reborn,"Because the world was simply chomping at the bit to get more of bumbling secret agent Johnny English back in 2003, he made a return to the big screen eight years later and Johnny English Reborn was... born. I, however, found the sequel only slightly more bearable than the first film and another unfortunate waste of Atkinson's comedic talents. Reborn finds our wacky hero off the grid and training deep in Asia when he is called upon once again by MI7, this time to help thwart an assassination attempt on the Chinese premier; double crosses and pratfalls ensue. If you're familiar with Rowan Atkinson's previous work, then you know what you're getting here. Expect a lot of broad, slapsticky humor in service of well-worn spy spoof clichés, and if that's your thing, then have at it. But, there's no guarantee this will appeal to anyone outside of its target PG demographic."
5,"Humorous, with the classic ""Johnny English"" genius","This movie is a well written, action packed, dimwitted flick with the characteristic Johnny English intelligence (literally.) His adventures and misadventures alike will leave you chuckling throughout the whole movie. But beware, you have to like the persona of Johnny English if you want to enjoy this movie, otherwise you will just think it is stupid."
5,awesome! so funny!,"I really enjoyed watching this movie. It is really truly funny, with lots of hilarious scenes, has great action, and Rowan Atkinson, who plays his role as Johnny English very well. It also has a great plot in the story. I think that this is a really awesome movie. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a really entertaining movie that will make you laugh."
1,What a group of talented people the writers and producers of this film,"The reason I called the writers and producers of this bomb of a movie: talented is because they have taken the funniest man alive and turned him into an unfunny, nasty, slow and unlikable character.The movie is slow, unfunny and a waste of good talented people."
3,Bit disappointed....,"I agree that the deleted scenes were way funnier! I had been so looking forward to the sequel but found the movie a little boring. Tried a little too hard, I would say.Gillian Anderson is horrible here! Looked pretentious with a pretentious accent that keeps slipping! And what happened? She looks so dried-up and skinny - lost all her gorgeous curves! Her face looks wasted and ill.Rosamund Pike is lovely but I find her role underdeveloped and she could have been more interesting! Only Agent One, the baddie is somewhat watchable.. And yes. They should have brought back Bough instead!All in all, kind of stilted."
1,Terrible,"I am amazed that this movie was filmed and distributed to the public. It's terrible, in my opinion.The movie was not funny at all and the acting was even worse."
1,Boring,It's a shame I wasted $3.99 to rent this movie... I made it about halfway through before I finally threw the towel in and turned it off.
5,Bought it for my daughter,She loved it anything bean is for her she laughes so hard at his antics that she has tears running
3,"Pretty Good,yet corny.","It's great to see Rowan Atkinson back,but they could've done a better job.It has all the great elements that the first one had,but it seems to be missing humor.Some of the jokes are a bit to corny.Overall,decent."
3,Front Exhaust Pipe from Amazon.com,The exhaust pipe was in great new condition. The problems started when I bolted the new pipe to the factory catalytic converter. The new pipe flange was welded at the wrong angle. When I tightened the bolts the exhaust hit the car body. I had to remove the newly installed pipe and bend it out. Now the exhaust vibrates. The rear exhaust pipe is now hitting the heat shield. Buyer beware!
1,This is a review of the .99 Kindle edition,"The free version has fewer errors, typographical errors, and bizarre marks than this one does. I don't know why, but I think it's disgraceful.Download the free version and give this one a pass."
1,Navet,"L'auteur narre ses aventures sur le terrain des conflits mondiaux. Il souffre du mal qu'il constate et des nombreuses injustices criantes, de la mme faon que le téléspectateur devant le journal télévisé du 20h00 s'écrie: ""que la guerre est moche!"".Ce qui surprend, c'est la teinte ""philosophique"" qui colore le reportage, non pas qu'il soit hors de propos de vouloir réfléchir sur le mal, entre la soupe et le fromage, mais parce que la réflexion de l'auteur est uni-dimensionnelle. Hegel est à l'honneur dans ce livre ainsi que son disciple Kojève. L'auteur semble donner l'impression qu'en dehors de ces deux référents, malgré les limites qu'il pressent parfois, rien ne saurait tre pensé.Si le livre était un film, il aurait rang de navet recuit. A éviter."
5,"Versatile, Dark, and LOUD","This Chinese cymbal is perfect for my tastes. It's got a great sustain that is bright and has a long duration, and it's a versatile cymbal. You can hit it towards the edge with a shank for a trashy sound, or if you hit it with the stick flat against the cymbal you can obtain a more metallic sound that you hear with many Zildjian or Paiste China cymbals.And, of course, as an acoustic drummer, my favorite part about any piece of my kit is the volume. My whole kit is loud, but this China really stands out about the rest of the kit. Everyone and their mother can hear this China from my home, even with a light touch. The volume of this China should really preserve it for any drummer. You can lightly hit this cymbal and get the volume of an 18"" medium crash at least, so you shouldn't have to hit this hard at all. Should keep it in pretty good shape."
3,A distinguished lone nutter's mind at work revealed,"A single good example of Richard B. Trask's ""thinking"" in this book is his observation that the bunched-up appearance of President Kennedy's jacket in a photograph that Trask is describing allows the single bullet theory to be correct. If this kind of lone nutter sensibility doesn't bother you too much, there are things here to weigh and consider. This book is far superior to the moral imbecility of a Posner, and is worth dipping into now and then."
5,"Alban Berg Quartet: Beethoven String Quartets, Vol. 3","Alban Berg Quartet: Beethoven String Quartets, Vol. 3.I had purchas before the vol. 1, and I anjoyed very much, so this was the razon to buy the other two volumes."
1,Not happy!,"The quality of the transfer from old tapes to DVD is very poor!I've seen other copies that are as good as watching the original ads,so I know it can be done. This time it wasn't!"
5,loved it,"An amazing, haunting pageturner. Beautiful writing and a moving, impressive conclusion. I fell in love with the characters and with the author's sensory descriptions of Iran."
4,The book that made me travel in time,"I opened Suzanne Pari's novel ""The Fortune Catcher"" and immidiately found myself back in Iran. Smells and noises, colors, the trembling hot air on my cheeks, a bubbling samovar, the beauty of the saffron mountains, they all appeared in front of me, surrounding me with the one and only atmosphere, the ""ab-o-hava"" of Iran. Ms. Pari created wonderful characters, such as that of Maman Bozorg, a cunning and manipulative family matriarch, who in her urge to control her loved-ones will not stop at anything. The book is beautifully written, so we forgive certain discrepancies, deftly concealed by the voil of the author's imagination and her profound knowledge of the country and its people. The touching story of Layla and Dariush follows in footsteps of traditional Persian literature with its romantic love poems and epics."
4,Fascinating while sometimes exaggerated,"When I first saw this book at my cousin's house, I wasn't particularily interested, but since I was bored I read it and after the first sentence I was hooked. This book is a tangled web of stories and people; colorful and dark characters. I loved the book once I was through, despite the exaggeration in it. (One character is tortured like political prisoners are, for commiting a crime that no one could be arrested for, according to my mother)I also learned a lot of Farsi, which was fun. I definitely recommend this book!"
4,Great Novel!,"A wonderful book from beginning to end! Although there were some slow sections, I found myself looking forward to reading more. I have never heard very much about Iranian culture and found this to be a refreshing change to the current books out there. I was caught up with the psychology of all the main characters and Susanne Pari does a great job in creating so many diverse personalities. I look forward to more novels like these."
4,"Loved it, loved it, loved it","This book reads like a Sidney Sheldon novel set in Iran. I loved the character sketches of the wacky Mossad agent and the fundamentalist granny. The hero and heroine struck me as ""too perfect"", I wish they were given some more depth. Overall, a highly entertaining read--I can't wait till the author comes out with another book!"
2,Not for new coaches,"I was very disappointed. This book is very confusing, and not a good guide for beginning coaches."
1,No luck twice,"Yard-Man QuickShift Gas Blower/Vacuum model # YMGBV3100Bought one, loved how it worked,lasted 1.5 year, thought I try another ,second one lasted less than the first, motors junk"
4,Janine is also a great chamber musician...,"Perhaps because of growing up in a musical family, Janine is also an outstanding chamber musician; but you have to look for her under ""Spectrum Concerts Berlin"" where she is first violin in albums of Dohnanyi, Harbison and Robert Helps."
5,"Pure gold,really awesome","To tell the truth I bought this CD just because of the only Foreigner's song I had heard till then,Urgent.Now I can tell you that this is one of the best CD's I've ever bought,a CD that will stay for years in my collection.Only the people that have heard the CD can understand me.I guess I was really lucky because I bought this CD withouth knowing any of these songs,so don't just trust your luck us I to find a GREAT CD,buy this.I'll rate the songs from the songs I liked most to the one's that I also liked but not so much: 1.You're All I Am 2.Spellbinder 3.Double Vision 4.Tramontane 5.Blue Morning,Blue Day 6.Back Were You Belong 7.I Have Waited So Long 8.Love Has Taken It's Toll 9.Hot Blooded 10.Lonely Children N'joy!"
3,Not as strong as their debut.,"The second album by Foreigner is ""Double Vision"" #3 in 1978. This album was a little louder, harder edged than the first one, but the material isn't as good. We still get some good numbers in the title track #2, ""Hot Blooded"", #3 and the meloncholy ""Blue Morning Blue Day"", #15. A few other songs still get played by me in , ""Love Has Taken Its Toll"" and ""Lonely Children"". In 1979 they released ""Head Games"", which I think is their best overall release.""Double Vision"" *** 1/2 stars overall."
3,Double Vision by Foreigner,Double Vision by ForeignerI felt the urge to get some Foreigner to add to my Computer collection. This is fun to go back and listen to these old Pop Rock standards. Glad I got them.
1,Lame,"This should ONLY be used as a reminder of how bad the 70's worst excesses were. Avoid. BTW, 'Hot Blooded' blows chunks."
4,I'm chanting as we speak,"I'm sure that most of us AB FAB fans agree that series 1,2 and 3 are the absolute best. Series 5 was better than series 4. As always, the bloopers are hillarious. I was disappointed that ""Wheels On Fire"" was instrumental in series 5. It's a great song and could have been done in a Junior Vasquez version by Bette Midler or Joan Jett. I am just thankful that Jennifer Saunders keeps AB FAB going. The woman is just brilliant. The things that come out of that mind! I hope there are many more series to come. Nothing makes me laugh as hard. Jennifer Saunder's Edina just blows me away. Her mannerisms, her facial expressions, her impatience with people. I could be in the worst mood, down and out, depressed; I pop in AB FAB and it instantly cheers me up. It almost works just as well as an antidepressant! If you have all the other series, naturally you have to have series 5!"
3,High Quality episodes. Poor Packaging.,"The episodes look fabulous. They're in widescreen, and the picture quality is top notch. Unfortunately, there is a lack of extras. The only extra is an amusing blooper reel. There's no commentary and as mentioned, the Chicago spoof has been excised. This is a disappointing set considering how great the season four package was."
2,Series Five,"Hi,I love Ab Fab but I am mixed about this season. I think many of the skits were mean with no real humor.There were some fun parts in the Christmas skit like when we meet Bo and Marshall again-their new line of work is so fun-and when we see Jackie for the last time! Buy if you love Ab Fab, but I fear in the end you will be left with one thought: mean."
1,Dissapointment,"Wow..It' pains me to have to rate Ab Fab my favorite show for years, this low. It's so upsetting to see your favorite show go down the drain.This series (5) was terrible. The show should have ended with series 4. Series 4 was still Ab Fab, this series is just ab fab pushed beyond it's character limits. The characters have become stale, and Jennifer Saunders has replaced lack of script with Celebrities. This show is still my favorite, but series 1-4 only. I was so dissapointed..some shows should stop while they are ahead. It really saddens me..so be warned, do not expect the ""real"" ab fab from earlier series."
2,Ugh,"What a disappointment....Yes, there are 8 episodes, but they are only 30 minutes in length (BBC sitcoms usually clock in at 40 minutes), and the first 6 are shockingly unfunny....Maybe they cut out all the funniest parts (which we know they did with the ""Chicago"" bit in one of the episodes)? I think the departure of Dawn French may have contributed to this season's weaknesses. Even Season 4 was showing signs of wear, but Season 5 will hopefully be the last. Sad, really, considering how hilarious the first 3 seasons were."
5,the best ever,I love the dvd's i purchased. I love AB FAB it's the most wonderful comdey i've ever watched I want to purchase more and maybe even purchase benny hill also he's another one of my favorite actor's
5,Best ARS CD,"This recording was from the height of their career and the most polished high energy southern rock other than 2 tracks which are love songs,song another mans woman and police police are the most rockin' tracks,one other CD that I would rate as high as this is Rock & Roll Alternative,follow by champagne jam, dog days, quinella and underdog being the other best recordings by far.You must get a few of these on CD if you are a southern music fan!briandj77@yahoo.com"
3,Red Tape,This album is good. This band is wondeful so all ARS CDs are good but not a Colections. I have one ARS Colection its 1 star. If you want this album its very rere so you can't find it in the stores.
3,Color is off,This turns out to be more of a ketchup color than a vibrant red and it's really sized more appropriately for juniors/older girls.
5,Great item,This book is full helpful information. Will be looked at time and time again. A must have for all American Character collectors.
5,misunderstood,"Leroy's essay on the abandoned man is too real and too devastating. The film starts with our hero's return from War and his struggle to re-enter society with a whole new set of values with no support from family, church, community or country and in one mistaken identity of motivation his life is ruined! The last moment in this film, is by definition the most harrowing I've ever seen! It stayed with my consciousness for months!The video transfer is very nice."
3,Yesteryears Chain Gangs,"A true story of a man sentenced to a prison that kept the prisoners shackled 24 hours a day. AKA (chain gang). Robert Burns played by Paul Muni, was sentenced for a crime he didn't commit. In this day and age he probably wouldn't have ever been found guilty and definitely not punished in the fashion he endured (ie) chain gang. The movie starts off a little slow but picks up a little. Not really like the type of prison movie made today but good for it's day"
4,A fantastic film !,"I watch this film when I was kid on TV and although it has passed a very long time since that ""first sight"" I was still amazed by the realism and darkness of this film. Paul Muni -as always- does a fantastic job and the ending is a one of the most impressive ones in the history of cinema.I highly recommend this film..."
5,paul muni was one of the great actors . this is a great film !,"i've seen Paul Muni in a number of roles now (including the also excellent ""The Good Earth"") and just wish to add support to the good people who are writing about this timeless , superb film . one more vote strongely in the Yes column . for what it's worth , my wife is not nearly as fond of older pictures as myself . she was riveted . as was i ."
2,Did not like this game at all.,"Heard a lot of good things about this game, but once i played it in my personal opinion I have to totally disagree."
3,Decent Read,"I agree with Fathom that there was way too much backstory here. Took too long to actually get to the real story. I enjoyed it for the most part, but found part the ""explanation"" of what happend 25 years ago so unbelievable I can't beleive the author didn't catch it. Or did she not care? Otherwise a pretty decent read. My first book by Ms. Brand; in looking over some of her others, might be my last. No interest in her other subject matters."
2,confusing set-up,"i finished this book only moments ago. i had to work hard to continue reading it because the set-up took way too long and was very confusing. the set-up had too much detail, which overshadowed the ""good part"" of the book -- when i FINALLY got to it. if the author truly felt the set-up was absolutely necessary, she could have interspersed flashbacks throughout the whole story (i am not a fan of that technique but it would have been better than how it is handled here). the intro does not fit with the description of the book -- and the description is what triggered my interest. i had to wade through a lot of stuff (hard to keep characters straight)in order to get to the primary story.i would caution a prospective reader. the book was finally good, but it took a lot of effort on my part to stick with it until then. i have plenty of books and so it wasn't as though i was desperate for a book, either."
2,"Eh, ok, but has not lasted.","This has not held up, and I cannot get the company to respond about replacement parts. The black plunger warped in the dishwasher, and one of the latch arms has broken off in less than a year. It's now a really expensive paperweight. When it worked, it worked well."
2,Review of Juicer,"The opening to put the food in is too small.For that reason, I sent the unit back and bought instead a Hamilton Beach BIG MOUTH-which I like, but already burned up one motor. Walmart exchanged it and the new one has been OK. So this blender may be great, but really didn't ever try it."
3,"Average juicer, hard to reassemble","In general, good yield if you used fruits such as Apple to make juice. Average yield for vegetable juice such as carrot. Somewhat hard to clean, juice & pulp can get in some crevices. Easy to disassemble but harder to reassemble, the blade needs to be fitted carefully on the nut, if it is not all the way down and completely flush, it will cut & damage the bottom of the cover & the plunger. Small feeding chute, you have to cut fruits into smaller pieces. Not diswasher safe, can warp the plastic parts. I found this out the hard way, after I put it in the diswasher, the plunger swelled up and no longer fit in the chute due to the high heat of my diswasher. Fortunately, Omega send a replacement plunger."
3,"Not bad, but not great.","As a die-hard Blue Rodeo fan, I could be a little biased. If you don't like their music, you may not like this particular album. Having said that, it's pretty good for their first shot. One of my personal favourites, ""Rose-Coloured Glasses"", has some very 80's type riffs, but the overall song is extremely catchy. ""The Joker is Wild"" is an up-tempo tune that is tough to get out of your head once you've heard it. By far the best tune on this album, ""Try"", has become a Canadian classic. Slow but beautiful, it showcases the vocal talents of Jim Cuddy and is a favourite at concerts. If you love Blue Rodeo, you'll want to have this in your collection."
3,Ecclesia Consulting Group,"Although a handy reference guide on various types of church policies and procedures, in our opinion, there could be more detail (particularly for beginners) on how to actually create the policies and procedures referenced."
5,Brings back good memories!,Awesome CD. Brought me back to my High School days. I haven't heard most of the songs since then. I put it on my iPod too!
3,spare yourself the expense,"I bought this to replace another mat breaker when I didn't know better. If you need this tool, then this is definitively much better than the one available in one of the chain pet stores. I rate it 3 stars because it cuts too much good (not matted) hair, which may destroy the coat . I also found out through experience that appropriate scissors (small, sharp, with rounded ends, used carefully) and a good brush can do a much better job than any matbreaker."
5,Worked like a charm,"This tool works well, but you can find it elsewhere for less than $39.00. PetSmart used to carry it for less than $15.00, but it's out of stock. Look around for it on the internet or further on Amazon.Safari De-Matting Comb for DogsThat's just one on Amazon. E bay has some, too.Good luck."
1,Useless for my Maine Coon,"My Maine Coon has developed some pretty bad knots on his sides, and after reading the positive reviews we decided to try this tool. It doesn't really do anything for our cat. It's not sharp enough to cut through the mats, and just ends up pulling his hair and skin underneath. I think the best way to go is with scissors! I would strongly recommend these also sold on Amazon:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0053V5VKK/ref=wms_ohs_product"
3,Old English Sheep dog,"This may be a great dematting tool, but not on my Old English. It ripped his hair out and was too painful to use. I ended up just cutting the mat out with scissors."
5,Fantastic Dematting,"I have three cats, shorthair, but they are indoor cats so they shed consistently throughout the year. This tool considerably reduces shedding. The cats do not object to combing with the Fuminator. It removes excess fur well beyond my expectations. This tool works. I would recommed it highly to anyone, whether dog or cat owner."
4,Cool tool,"I like the product, but you need 2 people to help dematt a cat. From what I used of this it works pretty cool. I would highly recommend it to anyone."
4,"Good tool, tough cat!","Tool is just as described. She hates all brushing, combing and dematting so this isn't magic."
1,DID NOT RECIEVE WHAT I ORDERED!,I would like to say the Mat Breaker Grooming Tool worked well but I was shipped a totally different item (some lawn and garden tool handle) and this company with no customer service concerns at all wanted ME to pay to return it. That would mean I'd pay for sipping 2 ways on an item I never ordered. I'll never do business with them again. I've never had such lame customer service considering it was THEIR obvious mistake in the first place.
3,ENTERTAINING SHOW,"3.5 starsWhile a formula police/FBI procedural show, i find it to be entertaining enough to watch the entire series.Thus it gets 3.5 stars as being above average in terms of entertainment.I particularly like to connection to real world concepts [math, physics, etc] to help solve complex issues. The writers do [did] and incredible job interweaving the particular math concepts and while the cutaways to illustrate the examples often got annoying [visuals], I think they did a great job showing that there are a lot of real world practical applications of complex mathematics. The only question I have is why we do not see this applied in more real world settings. My guess is that what is shown on this show [Charlie creating and running some algorithm] seems like it takes him a few hours and with no real obstacles [computers, manpower] actually would take a year with 100 people working on it.Anyway, I watch and feel it is a decent show."
5,As solid as any season,"Season 5 may be the most in depth of any of the seasons. After a shortened season 4 (for the same price), this full season is worth the money. Between the off the wall, but always helpful remarks of Larry, and the interactions between Colby and David, this season is at the top. If you are a Numbers fan, pick this season up, you won't be disappointed. The one change that some fans may not like is Meagan left the show, and is replaced by a somewhat irritating (in my opinion) former LAPD officer. The transition works. It allows the LAPD to become a slightly more important (and different) aspect than it once was."
5,"Love the show, miss the commentary","I love Numb3rs - it's one of my favorite shows ever. I was excited for the fifth season, but disappointed at the lack of audio commentary available. There are a few episodes with commentary, but not enough. This would not affect my decision to buy it again; it's just something to know ahead of time."
5,Numbers season 5,It's was the only season I was missing.could not find it anywhere.It clear up a lot of unanswered question I had about what happen after season 4.
4,Me encanta la serie,"Esta serie es muy interesante, podemos ver el como las matematicas son parte cotidiana de nuestra vida, es formidable.Tengo las otras temporadas y por eso me gustaria comprar la nueva cuando este disponible."
4,"A good old murder mystery, with surfboards","The brothers Eppes start out investigating a surfing accident to humor the victim's father and end up finding murder - and more. We also get a does of surf, sand, physics and mathematical modeling. They haven't run out of ideas, and I hope they never do ;-)"
4,Excellente,"This product , may be his manufacturer is good , but the product his self is very good, I recomended"
3,Wristband too small,"This watch is good value for the price provided that you have a very small wrist. I have an average-sized wrist but there were not sufficient holes to fit it, so be careful about that as they do not specify the length of wristband!!"
2,Too small,"Ordered this for my wife, but returned it because she said the numbers, and therefore, the watch were too small.This might be the right watch for someone looking for a very traditional look, but it's not large enough for today's style"
3,overpriced,"I've been looking for a watch for a long time so have a bit of an idea of what's out there. Most of the timex watches sold on Amazon sell for a lot less at Target or Walmart. The one shown here is only $24 in these stores and I once I saw it even in a dept. store. After reading the review of the woman who had 3 in a row stop working and could not return them, I would ask you to think just how easy it is to return anything at Walmart or Target if you have one in your area. The other thing is that the face of this and the easy reader is a full 1"", which to me seems too large for most women. I have a narrow wrist and I tried one of these on in a store and it looked pretty silly."
3,timex watch and game,"nice looking watch but strape to short.i am handicaped and sentson for a longer one charged me 20.00 and still to short. ride on outside of wrist. no more. Also said free shipping but was charged over 4.00 for that. i need a watch band that does not make my skin sore, that is why i ordered leather. so the gamehoyle will not work it comes up part way then all fogs out. can we chatt please? thank you and a very happy holiday."
3,SIMPLE,"If you are looking for an everyday wristwatch that stil looks classy,then this is your best bet.The leather is quite authentic and flexibleCool"
2,Disappointment,"I bought this watch 3 years ago and loved it. With a small wrist it's always a challenge to find a watch that fits, but this one did. It was very attractive and particularly the backlight was practical at night. Last week it stopped working. I took it to have a new battery installed and to my surprise I was informed that the battery was working just fine. Something else had failed. To find out, the watch would have to be sent in for diagnosis and the cost is unknown in advance. So I decided not to have it repaired and look for a new watch. Too bad, I really liked that watch. This time I will look for a different brand than Timex."
2,I watch for really small arms!,"This watch was disappointing.The band is quite small, more of a child size or petite adult.The watch face is nice, but also small... and the date is TINY.I returned mine as it did not work at all for me."
4,Very clear,"I have found over the years that the most important thing in an origami book is clear diagrams. This book, in addition to clear diagrams has excellent photographs.The pictures were taken in such a way as to let the reader see exactly what the folder was doing. Each project has reminder sketches of how to fold its base. This elimanates flipping around through the book from project to base to project. Its a very nice feature for beginners and forgetfullers. I would have liked more projects, but that is always the case. The star box and the butterfly were my favorites in the book. Definitely worth the price."
3,origami for beginners,"it is really for beginners. i also think there should have been more pictures. some of the folds are tough to make out. there is a section in the beginning on general fold types. when referenced in specific figures later in text, it is not apparent how general fold fits in."
3,Nice book but did not receive the practice paper.,"The book is well laid out and well written. Disappointed that it did not come with the advertised practice paper. Had to make my own for my daughter. It was a Christmas present, so I am a little let down."
5,Get Pissed,"You're probably already upset about the way the 2000 (and now 2004) election(s) went - I don't blame you.This book goes through the whole nasty tale bit by bit. Trust me: you'll get angrier and angrier as you get through it. But, like most of us, your anger will eventually subside, and you'll go back to being a passive-agressive Bush hater. You'll be in good company (I'm sure).Good read - it'll keep you warm until 2008."
4,An Eye Opener,"Great investigative reports on various political, economic, and religious national and international topics.Names such as John F. Kennedy, Bush family, Pinochet of Chile, Pat Robertson of the 700 Club, Ken Lay of Enron, Putin, Clinton, Tony Blair, Margaret Thatcher and others are mentioned and discussed. This book tends to give more focus to the Republican's policies, but it also discusses the Democrat's mischievous ways.All in all, after reading this book I understand better why I don't support the dual party system that we have in the US (both parties are sell-outs to big money corporations and special interest lobbyists) and why I support third & fourth party independent candidates."
3,worth the read,"worth the read..another great work from Greg mocking our USA democracy system (corporatocracy)..the filth at the capitol hill, the lobbyists.."
5,The truth is there for all to see,"Greg Palast uncovers the truth and exposes it without siding or leaning with any political party. This is what true journalism is, we have too many ""news programs"" digesting the news for us and showing us their interpretations about what really matters. Most journalists nowadays are afraid to expose blatant injustices perpetrated by our government because those news are not what sales to the lethargic majority. Because this disinterest politicians made decisions for us that favors their pockets without any benefit to the communities and the people who they represent. We criticize other countries for being corrupt, meanwhile here corruption also reaches the highest levels of government, the only difference is that here we change the laws to make corruption ""legal""."
3,Learned response,"There are some very learned responses to this book in these reviews, so I thought I'd add my own. Apparently the author has a problem with the capitalist ethics that are supposedly increasing their hold on the world. He apparently investigates some figures and statistics, and then reports about them in this book. My main question is, does the author expect to be paid for doing this work, and if so, how concerned can he really be about Tanzania's crippled economy? I guess some people are interested in this kind of thing, and I'd recommend this book to those people. So in conclusion, I'd give this book a 3 out of 5."
1,"Physician, investigate thyself (and the BBC)","While some of the public acquisations that Mr. Palast might make are true, and common knowledge, he fails to mention some of the connections to socialist organizations that have shown corruption, such as the BBC and their failing to report atrocities committed by the Hussein regime, or the forged BBC letter from Florida. Or how about the connections to Ramsey Clark and the World Workers Party and other pro-socialist groups?We are all begging to know Greg. Enlighten us..."
1,More left-wing lunacy,"More left-wing lunacy from one of America's most notorious socialists. Filled with hate-spewed ideology against open markets, globalization and just about everything else...Greg Palast's book is yet another illogical screed by an indiviual who loves Karl Marx but hates Ronald Reagan...Unless you've already consumed copius amounts of Moveon.org Kool-Aid you won't enjoy this ridiculous book. SAVE YOUR MONEY."
1,Stealing Elections?,"I think it's telling that those who accuse the Bush brothers of stealing the election in Florida totally ignore evidence that the Gore team was engaged in the same tactics. Neither side has clean hands here folks. Many illegals voted in Florida, military ballots were excluded and an early call sent panhandle conservatives home. That Palast ignores all of these facts reveals him as a partisan. That he glorifies socialism while completely ignoring socialism's WELL DOCUMENTED ills and evils heaps more discredit on his work."
5,A must read for Progressive thinking people,First hand knowledge and great insight from a good Reporter. The section on the 2000 Florida voting scandal should be required reading for all High School students.
2,"Good book, but....","Thanks God there are people like Palast who still can write about the ugly truth. So, although I agree with most of the points exposed in the book (that are very well researched), my two stars rating is not about the text, but it is due to bad writing style.The book lacks cohesion and a smooth flowing of ideas. It seems a bunch of previous articles put together in a rush. The result is that it's not an easy reading or logical reading."
3,"Good points, egotistic reporting!","Let us not kid ourselves, Palast is a braggard. Some of his facts, I've found, are erroneous and/or subjective. Sure, the democratic deblacle of the Florida 2K shennenigan was an era-marking issue, and his reporting was good, but his writing about HIS OWN reporting was just too much for me!Chapter 1 and 2 are unreadable; he talks more about his abilities as a reporter than of the issue itself. I recommend, instead, Molly Ivins' BushWhacked and Shrub."
5,"incredible, informative, wonderful style","Palast has achieved somthing with this book. A small paragraph in its honor will NOT do it justice. Most importantly, if you care about America and it's future, you have to read it. This book will enlighted and move you. It's a great read."
5,amazingly well documented,"It is telling that Palast's most vocal critics are quickly reduced to slinging barbs like the ever-handy ""anti-American"" slur. Palast has an obsession with documentary evidence, and his book is full of photicopies of reports, direct references to interviews, meetings, and fully reported incidents. What is even more amazing: when Palast doesn't have documentation, HE TELLS YOU HE DOESN'T HAVE IT (can you imagine Fox news bing that honest??? They would be bankrupt in a week.)The truth of the matter is that Palast's critics can't refute him -- he has done too fine of a job mastering his craft and documenting his sources."
4,Bold and Persistent Journalism,"The claims made by Greg Palast in this controversial book appear at first to be so over the top that no one could believe them. Then, as time and investigations continued, much of his early reporting about the Florida election fraud turned out to be right on the money. The result was another black eye for the mainstream media who was so afraid of being wrong that they said nothing at all. Greg's notes were so revealing that I took them to heart when writing my own novel about the six year long Florida election scandal. After a year of study I was unable to disprove a single thing he wrote. If only America had an atmosphere that rewarded his kind of bold and persistent journalism."
5,Should be on the 25 best seller list,"Having just finished Chapter 1, Jim Crow in Cyberspace, The Unreported Story of How They Fixed the Vote in Florida, I was standing in front of my hotel in Miami Beach. A taxi drove up and 6 Republican Party Members with signs saying such got out; to attend some sort of event I guess. I wished I had Greg Palast's book in hand to hold out as some sort of protest or protection against their illegal shenanigans. I was shaking and outraged as I got in my taxi and I was shaking and outraged as I read Palast's book.Read the book, get in the know, and do what you can."
5,excellent piece of work,"this is a great book, fantastically well researched with loads of telling details about everyday corruption - not just in the US (especially the shameful episode in Florida in 2000), but also Latin America and the UK (new Labour's relationship with lobbyists was exposed to scrutiny well before the ""taxi-for-hire"" expose some years later)."
2,"seller neglected to post actual sock sizes, which you find out along with the package day of","what an incredible waste of time, did not want to try on the socks afterward. it looks a lot thicker in the picture, but when you get it, it's panty hose material on top, and styrofoam on the bottom. super light weight, and WRONG SIZING, now i have to go back and order a smaller size, and pay for shipping if i want a refund from this person. p*ssed off."
4,Lifesaver on hot days,"I've been playing beach volleyball in SoCal for almost 10 years. My sand socks stay in my bag all year round. During the hot days of July and August, the sand can get up to 120 degrees, making it impossible to play unless you want to end up with a foot full of blisters. These socks make it possible to keep on playing, especially during all-day tournaments. You still feel the heat, but it keeps blisters from forming. The socks stay on even when you're diving all over the place, and they keep the sand out as well. You can even wear them during the winter when the sand is freezing cold to keep your feet warm.With enough playing they will eventually develop tears and rips, but for the price, you get a lot of usage out them. I just bought another pair for the next couple years of playing."
2,Ill-fitting for large-footed thin people,"I bought a pair of sand socks for a beach ultimate frisbee tournament. I wear shoes normally in a size 13, occasionally 14, so I purchased the extra large (listed sizes 12 1/2 - 14). While they fit my feet fine, the fastener around the calf must have been designed for enormous, overweight people. There was no way using the socks' fasteners to keep it high and tight on my leg, which in turn led the foot portion of the sock to become extremely baggy with every step.I wouldn't buy again, but with an pair of easy fixes (more elastic up top and a longer velcro-faster, it had the adjustment range of about one half-inch), I'm sure they would be a fine product."
3,Sandy only,"I bought these with the hope that I could diffuse the heat from cement swimming pool decks at public pools. When I got the package, only then did I find out that these socks are meant for ONLY for sand-based volleyball games, or general walking through the sand and in the water at a beach. They are probably great for that, but the product material didn't mention that other usage would destroy the socks.So, if you are going to the beach and want to wear foot protection in the sand and in the water, these should do the trick. If you want to protect your feet on anything else, then the socks will probably get torn up and won't provide much protection."
5,Great for Toddlers,"My 4 year old son loves to watch people play PS2, but can't seem to control most of the games. We bought Dora and the purple planet and it was great! He has no problems controlling Dora or figuring out what to do. What's great is that Dora can't just fall off cliffs or anything. It goes from level to level so it keeps from being boring. A great buy for a toddler just getting into video games."
4,GOOD GAME,"This game is great my 4 year old daughter loves it. The same day I ordered this game I ordered one from Disney also, I recived this game a week after I ordered it (which is a week before christmas) and as of January 1st I still have not recived the one from disney. I am very impressed with the quickness of the shipping."
3,Dora the Explorer: Journey to the Purple Planet,We got this game for our 3 year old daughter. I wanted it because she loves Dora. She loves the game and understands it well. I think the animation could be a lot better. It's not as clear as I hoped it to be. Unfortunatly there aren't very many little girl ps2 games and my expectations for this game were very high.
5,All Dora fans unite!....,"As with any Dora collection when this game first came out, I bought it for my daughter. I played it first with her, and she ended up taking the controller away from me because she was too eager to play. Easy to follow through, don't worry about Dora falling off a cliff, because the game doesn't allow that feature. Even though she has mastered the game, she still loves to pick a planet and play. As with other reviews, just limit the time that your child plays with the game, and remind them that the good ol'outdoors also has adventures just waiting to be 'explored'."
3,Fun but too short....,My just turned 4 yr old fininshed this game in 3 days. You think they could add some mini games or something. Not really worth $30.. It would be better just to rent it.
3,Just Replying to the Disc Read error.....,"This happened to my sons original PS2 twice. I called Sony, and they repaired it free of charge both times. It happens because the reader goes out, and since it's a defect in their product, they'll fix it."
4,The Seventh Season,"If you're contemplating buying the 7th Season, you're obviously familiar with the series. This edition is just like the rest...Very funny. Aside from the annoying traits of the characters which at times can madden a saint, you'll do as you always have...laugh out loud. It's worth every penny."
4,"Great episodes, not so good bonus material",I am a big of ELR and have all the DVD season sets. Each year the show seems to get better and better with funny episodes and great writing. Each actor seems to bring out more in their characters and make them funnier and more lovable. Season 7 is no exception. There are many hours of very funny entertainment on these DVDs. My only dissappointment is with the bonus material. The blooper reel is only a scant 6 minutes or so long. In the other seasons it has been on the order of 15 minutes. The bloopers are some of the funniest material on the DVD so I would love to see as much of that as they can squeeze on the disc. Otherwise a great DVD to add to the Raymond collection.
5,Super Seventh Season of Everybody Loves Raymond,"This Seventh Season of Everybody Loves Raymond is just super as all theothers were, it is too bad that the show went off the air, as the castbrought a lot of laughter to many households. I highly recommend thisSeventh Season for anyone that wants to enjoy some good laughs."
4,THE HOLIEST CRAP OF TV SHOWS,"This is clearly the first season of ELR where the quality of the show's writing started to take a dive and even though my dislike of Chris Eliott had me swearing I would never purchase it, a little lowering of the price plus the great ""Baggage"" episode made me give in. I also loved the episode where Debra ends up in jail as well as the ""Robert's wedding"" double feature but I thought ""She's the one"" was way to outrageous and unbelievable, no matter if it's suppossed to be based on a real life ocurence (or so they say). At any rate, ELR is one of my all time favorite shows and even though I think the quality of the last few season wasn't quiet as good, none of them lack at least a few terrific episodes."
3,copys,some the shows are on the other season its the same showsis #8 going to have the same shows I have on the other once?
5,two nights to down the whole season,"found this in the mail on saturday evening, went to watch it, and by sunday evening, i was done with the whole season. 25 episodes of non stop laughter. I wish they had released season 8 and 9 as well instead of making me wait :) As soon as season 8 is on pre-order, i'm getting it!"
4,I love this show!,"Great season and still very funny. (Fred Willard is hilarious).I admit it's not the best season of Raymond (4th or 6th for me), but it's worth having. Laugh out loud funny!"
1,Not exactly what I was ordering,"DVD's look to be copies of the originals. I have ordered the past 6 seasons, all came in boxed sets with the cast pictures on each DVD, this was some hearts and the name ""everybody loves raymond"" printed on each. Very weird, feel like I ordered them from some bootleg site or something. Not sure what to do now but try and return them so I can get what I wanted. Make sure you read the post when ordering from this seller and might want to ask for more clarification on the item before buying."
4,Just like our own families,"As an italian-american,I can relate to the humor and family relationships. The Barone's are the greatest."
5,Season 7,"What's not to love about all Raymond shows? Most of the shows are fabulous, but a few of the episodes with Amy's parents and brother are on the wierd side."
5,"Raymond, Raymond, Raymond",Received this and gave family member as a Christmas gift. We watched it together. Hillarious as usual. Love it
3,Just a regular combination square,"This product is not delivered as advertised. It is advertised with a black blade scribed with yellow color in the scribes. The blade is neither black or scribed. The blade is plane steel with black ink markings, no better than any square you can purchase at the hardware store. Oh well, I hope Amazon updates the description on the website. The square was average in all other respects. Not quite square but as good as any other construction grade square."
2,Incorrect product description,"I received this product for Christmas and was disappointed. The product description provided is wrong. The ruler is regular steel colored with black etched markings, not ""Unique high visibility black blade with deep etchings filled with yellow paint"". At first I thought they might have just shipped the wrong version, but it came with clear marked package labeled with the model #46-123.Yes, the square works but it isn't nearly as easy to read as I had anticipated. I'm very disappointed."
3,Wrong photo,"Alas no black and yellow blade. Product number is correct, photograph is not.Customers have been complaining about the inaccuracy of the pictured square since 2005!Surely Amazon can correct this discrepancy?"
4,Works fine,"Nice, average combo square. Not a high precision or heavy duty instrument but good value for the money. Easy to read. Yellow makes it easy to find in my toolbag, and it is easy to know that it is mine when working with others."
2,"cheap, yet overpriced","My wife had one of these and I used it for some rough construction work outside. It was not perfectly square but it was close enough for building a fence. The level was so far out of plumb so as to be useless. Besides, it broke when I knocked it off my bench. The blade came out, the holding pin was lost, so it can't ever be used as a square again. For less money, you can buy the Empire ""pro"" square, which, although it is no Starrett, is still accurate and much more robust. I keep the Starrett inside my shop. The empire is in the traveling toolbox. The old Stanley blade will make a great scraper or paint-can opener."
4,"Not Quite Great Enough, but Close","I've been a Legion fan since 1973, and I was really looking forward to this.I thoroughly enjoyed the story, but two things forced me to knock it down a star. First, the coloring: the modern colors on glossy paper looked horribly garish in comparison to my singles.The second thing that bothered me is that the backup story from issue 291, which was originally illustrated by Howard Bender, was replaced by the Giffen-drawn version that was included in the original trade. Giffen's art had changed drastically in the intervening period, and the redrawn story looks completely out of place.I think this book would have looked much better on matte paper and without the redrawn sequence.The story is still great, the packaging leads something to be desired."
2,Did not hold up over time,This story arc was one of the most memorable of its time when I read it originally back in the day. I couldn't wait to reread this and boy I coudn't wait to finish it. God awful dialogue made it unreadable. The memory was better.
5,Deluxe Indeed !,I'd forgotten this old gem. This is a real good looking edition of the classic 80s Legion storyline. Perfect gift for Legion fans and interested newcomers.
3,Not THAT Great!!,"When this story came out, it was many times better than the awful Legion stories that faithful fans had to endure in previous years. To watch Giffen's artwork get better with each issue was a treat. Levitz and Giffen understood Legion lore and knew how to entertain the old fans.The problem: Darkseid. Prior to this story, Darkseid had made NO previous appearance in Legion stories. Because of this, when his identity is revealed, I was left confused. Not having any prior knowlegde of this character, I wondered who the heck he was and how he fit in the continuity. Its as if Lex Luthor showed up in a Sgt. Rock comic."
2,Hummmmph.......!,"Although I have heard about this story since I started collecting comics in 1987, as it being a classic for DC Comics and the Legion of Super Heroes in particular, I could not came to enjoy it while I was reading it.The art if nothing to write home about. I could understand that maybe at that time, the art was considered good or great, but there is art from the 70s (Neal Adams' Batman, or Marshall Rogers') that is way better that this. Also, the build up to reveal the ""ultimate"" villain behind all the troubles in the story is definitely killed by know, as everybody know who he is, without even opening the book.I just like that this is a Deluxe Edition, as I have other deluxe edition books on display in my house, so it serves as a nice companion. But, I think it will be maaaaaaany years until I re-read this story again, in hopes of finally enjoying it."
2,Intriguing but.....,"After completing this book, I was horrified to discover that the author is an editor for a major newspaper. While the story is intense and intriguing, the writing was pitiful. At times, I found it difficult to continue reading because of the lack of fluency and transition. The story plot is original and clever but I fear the author needs to revisit grammar and sentence mechanics 101."
3,Original and superficial,"""The Serpent Club"" is a strange mix of fiction and thriller.Its language is spare and broken, the thoughts and dialogue mingle in a forced alliance. Newspaper reporter Ted Lowe, an unlikely hero, is obssesed with the tragic life and death of 12 year old Megan Wright. He is an odd and disturbed man and I found it a major difficulty to identify with him. The excessive violence doesn't help much, and L.A. seems like a place where bad people should go after they die. This is deffinitely original and creative book, but little schlocky and superficial in the same time. Three and a half stars for this picky reader."
1,Poor Attempt...,"I don't care if this book is supposed to illustrate the moral deprivation of the modern world... it is terrible. Other books that deal with the same sort of ""essential human sickness"" that The Serpent Club deals with usually have some sort of resolution; that is, something that makes you put down the book nodding your head in agreement and fulfillment. This book leaves you shaking your head in disgust. I found no pleasure in this novel, becuase it is a case of depravation triumphing over reason and good, even in retrospect. Usually I have great respect for books: this is the only one in memory that I have tossed straight into the trash when I was done reading it."
1,This may be a SPOILER so only read if you've read the book,"Here's my problem with this plot (which has more holes than Ollie North's testimony): If a man commits a murder and the female victim has his DNA under her fingernails, but the authorities think his son actually committed the murder so they check the son's DNA, then wouldn't that still be a match? It seems the son in this book was glad to give up his DNA sample because he knew his father did the deed. I'm no expert on DNA testing, but I think that the son's and father's DNA would match so closely that the son would still be a suspect, even though in the story the DNA didn't match and that was part of the evidence used to exonnerate him. I could go back and reread some of the story, but there's nothing good about it so I'll just spend the rest of my life wondering."
2,Are people really this callous?,"The very most shocking and disapointing event in the book is when the main character fails to save his ex-girlfriend and her daughter from inevitable death. As a matter of fact, this character failed miserably. Lots of people stand by and let bad things happen - fail to get involved - believe they can't make a difference. Sadly, that's sort of what this book was about. I hope our culture produces better than that."
2,A let down. Obviously a first-time novelist.,"The book starts well, pulling you into the situation. As the story progresses, it is easy to see certain connections early. Most of the side stories are unbelievable and have nothing to do with moving the story along. I did not find myself identifying with or liking the protagonist in the story. Very unsatisfied."
5,Gripping you until the last page,"This is my kind of book. To be held until, literally the last page of the book. Tom has a gift for writing suspense thrillers. I read this book in one sitting. It is absolutely amazing stuff. I am eager for his next page turner. GREAT WORK! It is scary to think this fictional crime actually does happen in real life."
1,"This ""air cooler"" is a joke! Don't waste your money!!!",This is nothing more than a tiny humidifier. It doesn't cool the air even if you stick your face right in it. Any fan would do more than this. It was a total waste of money.
2,The Man,"Product arrived early. It was a little worn and yellowed to be called ""good condition"" by my standards. The price was 4 times higher than the original purchase price. I started to read this book when I was younger and wanted to know the story, so I purchased the book."
2,This is not likely to help your survival,"This book feels like a hodge-podge of powerpoint presentation slides: bullet points and lists, but not much in the way of insights.It is also hard to understand whether the focus is truly on a start-up, because the book often reads as a management textbook for mid- to large-size corporations.It is also very UK-centric - especially in the beginning - which may or may not be what you need."
5,If You Only Play One Game EVER...This Should Be It!!!,I Think that about sums it up... It's a point and click mystery... great everything... one warning... timing matters on the vines... (you'll see)
1,these thermometers do not give accurte temps.,maybe two out of the 10 will give the right temp all others will range from about 30 to 40 degree differences
1,Yikes! Don't get these,I bought two boxes to use with my sixth grade science class. NO two of them agree on a temperature when they were put into a tub of room temp water.Some of them registered a temp below freezing in our heated classroom.
3,Just works,"The Thermometers:- work well ..- use no mercury (alcohol-based liquid)..- are easy to read from near distance only ..- very light-weight ..- are easy to hang on the wall ..- not durable at all .. (and I didn't expect them to be!)- cheap (that's exactly what I wanted!)..- useful ..Buy them for educational purposes, or to distribute them all over your company's rooms ..For personal use, better to look for something like one of these:Timex TX1001 6.5-Inch Tube ThermometerTimex TX1007 Suction Cup Wall Thermometer and Hygrometer"
1,not worth it,"plastic tip was broken, very poor prduct not even worth $2. Seller charges shipping too much, if you order two of them shipping fee on each item and comes in same box!"
4,Much fun!,The Pirate King was fascinating - the costume and the unique mannerisms were astonishingly like Johnnie Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow. I wonder which came first? Surely one modelled on the other!
5,"The best ""Pirates"" production I have ever seen.","If you love Gibert and Sulivan, you will love these productions by Opera Australia. They do an excellent job. This is one I will watch over and over."
4,The first three books of the Long Tall Texans series.,"Although I enjoy reading DP's books, I get tired of the repetition. Sometimes I think if you have read one of her books then you have read them all. The heroines are usually naive virgins who don't know how to dress and put up with too much from the heros. The heros usually behave badly until they quit fighting their feelings for the heroine. And all the jewelry stores only sell emerald solitairs. Reguardless of all this the stories are usually good. Some are better than others. But I do wish the women had careers, backbones, and didn't need a makeover. Justin was my favorite in this book because Shelby didn't need a makeover or seem so naive."
3,Something to kill the time,"I bought this book to read on the beach and got sunburn because I couldn't put it down. More than once I found myself wanting to slap the heroines (even calling them that is a stretch) - all three are proper and meek to the point of frustration. The men are equally as frustrating, but to the other extreme - they are all male testo-pigs. But, to feel as strongly as I do about the characters, they must been well-written. The dialogue at times is unreal but the settings are vivid.This book will kill a few hours, but more than likely you'll wish you'd been doing something else."
4,must read if you are long tall texans fan,"i was enjoyed reading this long tall texans series. the story brought me into jacobsville world that create by the author. each story i red really entertain me and blew me away, although it just a fiction. but the romance felt real for me. looking foward for next purchased on this series"
5,Nice & Slow Brian Culbertson,"My brother asked me to order this cd for him recently an he told me to check it before I give it to him. This is a great recording,every track is outstanding. I have listening to Brian`s recordings on a local jazz radio station but had never purchased anything he had put out, but after to Nice & Slow I have to place an order so I can have my own cd."
5,Super Read,"I've enjoyed Lordon's mysteries in the past, but this one is just a super read. I loved it. It's characters are interesting and fun, it's plot exciting, and it's tone refreshing.A must for anyone who loves to read and anyone who loves to read mysteries."
4,not just an American culture phenomena,"I've read this book and found my mom written in the pages. The author also gave excellent advice on how to deal with our ""mama drama"" without breaking our relationship with her. However, I feel I need to say something about one of her points, namely her claim that ""mama drama"" is supported by the American culture, but not the Asian culture. As someone who has grown up with the Asian culture in the American society, I know this is not true. Personally, I have often found the American culture to be more respectful of a child's or a subordinate's dignity than the Chinese culture. Respecting the elders is a wonderful value, but it can also mean the elder can abuse the child and the child can't protest or fight back, because doing so is considered disrespectful."
2,disappointing,"I found this book very disappointing. It kept repeating that we should let things go, that we should reestablish a good relationship with our mother, with no guidance whatsoever. It either oversimplified things, or just said things like: after 20 years of work she had the relationship she wanted with her mother...To begin with I don't want the process to take 20 years, and second, what do you do? Women who buy books like this are looking for specifics, not anecdotes."
2,crying in toledo,"I am going through a divorce after being married 9 years. I was looking to this book for help in dealing with my emotional upheaval and was pretty disappointed. Most of the woman in the book, who were sharing their stories with the reader, were never even married to the guy they were breaking up with. Alot of them had never even lived with the guy! I felt it mocked my pain listening to people who had been just dating a guy for four months cry there heart out over how awful they felt. They can't imagine what awful really is at that stage. Also I was very surprised at the number of letters that were about lesbian breakups. Not that they aren't having pain, I just felt it should have been addressed in a book just for that purpose."
2,Disappointing quality,"For the price, I thought these would be closer to sterling, or that the ""crystals"" would look like glass, at least, but the ""crystals"" looked closer to plastic, and the metal was nowhere close to sterling, or so it appeared to me."
3,africa and its animals - a humerous historical insight,First of all - you have to rememebr that this book was written several decades ago...and that things ahve changed a lot since then in Africa.The scenery is graphicaly portrayed - and the incidents that occur in Durrell's animal collecting adventures are classic Durrell humour!A great book for anyone who loves African animals with fantastic descriptions not only of the animals - but also their temprements and traits!A good read for a rainy day.....
5,fast shiping,"The shiping was really fast and the item is new like said. Everyone should have one, it helps out on everything."
5,WONDERFUL,"the numbers are easy to read, the readings are very accurate, it is very durable, and it unique color makes it easy to distinguish from everyone else quick square. just a great buy"
4,Speed Square,"This is nice with the yellow on black, it makes it easier to read. Besides that, it is just a regular old speed square. Nothing like the Dewlt speed Square."
1,Not square at the end,"I will be returning this as the flanges at the 90 degree end were ground off and that would make it useless for my purposes. I liked the bright markings which is why I ordered it, but when it's not square everywhere it needs to be it'll have to go back."
5,nice square,"its Aluminum frame makes it lightweight, the yellow on black make it very easy to read. makes a great square."
1,It's not Good performance att all,"Well i purchase this antenna thingking that they were gonna increase the signal of my router, they dont do it. So dont even think about buying this things, if you want something that works buy the real ones Linksys brand, this WiFi World Quality is not good at all, so i recomend not to buy this becuase it doesn't work, i fif not return them because i Live on Costa Rica and its to expensive to retun them for what i was gonna get back. use something real not fake antennas."
4,Great!,"I love house music. And to be honest not many people appreciate house music for what it really expresses. House is music to soothe your soul and make you open up your mind. It is like a drug, a very addictive drug, but only this time it is a good one. This 2-disc CD expresses underground house. Such as Armand Van Heldon, GambaFreaks, C.D.K. and others. Wonderful mixes from the top house DJ's around the world. All I am going to say is that if you love underground garage, 2-step, and/or trip-hop, you WILL love this"
5,A FantasticCdForAnyoneWhoBelievesThatLoveIsStillOutThere.,"If you believe that somewhere out there True Love waits for you or if you are waiting for it, or if you are just moved by romantic soulful music, then you should get this cd.Also, if you are feeling lost about what to do about Love, Eric and Lesly Ludy's book ""When God writes your Love story"" is an excellent addition to this soulful cd.I absolutely Loved the cd and the book."
3,Flightcrank - Beyond All Reasonable Doubt,"Flightcrank produces slightly off-kilter Bristol trip-hop reminiscent of the sadly missed Cup of Tea label, but you have to wonder if it's a little too late. On their debut BEYOND ALL REASONABLE DOUBT, there's an interesting injection of folk-rock into the mix (such as on the uplifting ""Amazing"") and a Tricky-esque track (if Tricky suddenly decided to go uptempo) in the sexy and funky ""What U Need."" The live feel to the instrumentation also give a vibrant quality to the music. Flightcrank reminds me of Monk & Canatella during their mid-90s highpoint, with indie-rock-tinged male vocals. While that's not to say that anything on this album is bad or that there's nothing of value on this album -- it's just a little behind on the times, I'm afraid."
5,True Story,This is a true story that takes you back in time to the early day's of Bush Pilot's in the Great White North! These guys were the astronauts of their time.
2,...Don't let yourself be fooled,"As a casual Yes fan who has loved ""Roundabout"" and ""I've Seen All Good People"" since I was a kid in the 1970's, I was thrilled when I came across this for a bargain-basement [$$]. How disappointing it was to listen for the first time and not even recognize those favorite songs of mine. Sure, the band does a highly-professional job in the live versions included here, but neither even approaches the genius of the studio version. The recorder on ""ISAGP"" is barely audible, and the singing on Roundabout is altered from the arrangement I know and love. If you're a generic, know them from classic rock radio Yes fan like I am, steer clear. Leave this one for the Yes anthropologists who want to own these obscure versions.There. That review should offend every serious Yes fan."
2,Not what I was expecting,"Yes is a great band, but unless you want the live versions of ""Roundabout"" and ""I've Seen All Good People"" do not buy this CD. The CD cover does not state that these are the live versions, which I thought was very misleading."
2,Sometimes taste changes....,"I liked this band when I was a kid. They are incredible musicians, but it seems the songs are a reminder of when music was more about the spectacle. The lyrical content is often struggling to keep up with the grandiose musical visions and generally failing miserably. The Roger Dean cover is appropriate; fun to look at, but basically a cartoon. That equates fairly well to the music on this CD."
4,Still the best single disc compilation of YES's career!,"By now, there have been numerous YES greatest hits packages, including two large box sets; yet this is the compilation I keep coming back to because it captures YES at the heart of their progressive stardom from 1971 through 1977.You get full-length versions here, including ""Long Distance Runaround"" immediately followed by ""The Fish"". You also get ""And You And I"", which has managed not to be featured on many other YES compilations. Pity, because it's one of their most enchanting songs; although I believe on the YESYEARS box set, there is a live version recorded during the Trevor Rabin years.The only down side is that ""Roundabout"" and ""I've Seen All Good People"" are live versions taken from their 1979 tour. While they're still enjoyable tunes, the original full-length version would have made this CD perfect."
4,Some Really Good Stuff,"If you want one Yes collection-this is the one to have. This is a good album to put on in the car or if you're at home doing chores or reading a good book, as most of these songs are well over 5 mins. long. Get this & see why Yes was ahead of it's time way back when. Highly recommended."
1,Not delightful,"Typical christian scare tactic book... Fanatical christians, as is true with fanatical members of any religious sect or cult, tell stories to scare people into becoming followers. This book is no exception....Read this book if you want to be reminded of the fact that fanatical christians are some of the scariest people on earth."
5,Brings the Shakespeare concepts to life,It's hard to peg the age range for this retelling of Shakespearean drama: Stephen Lambert's color drawings break up the text and Birch's modern retellings makes it accessible for a younger audience than the traditional stories would; but much print makes it an unlikely picturebook choice. Parents will want to consider Shakespeare's Tales for read-aloud to kids beyond the picturebook age: Shakespeare's Tales brings the Shakespeare concepts to life with modern tellings and accessible plots.
2,Horrible~,customer service was fine but the shield lasted 4 days then shattered in the car wash ...horrible product.
3,Yep definitely Contractor Grade,"Background: I'm a weekend woodworker/furniture maker. I needed a large square for large pieces of furniture I'm making.Pros- Very light- Very Easy to read- The measurements I tested with a high precise rule and the markings where dead on.Bad- The square I purchased was not dead on square. Saying that, square enough for rough work but not even close for precise work.My thoughts: If you need a square for Contract rough work...excellent. Looking for a square for woodworking...stick to your engineering square."
4,yummy snacks for both kids and adults,"One of my adult students brought me a pack of these banana nibbles, just so that I could try them, and I am now hooked. This price that Amazon has is also superb.What's so great about them? They taste like banana bread, and I love banana bread! Also, they are not overly sweet. The organic ingredients are a real plus, and I'm more willing to pay what these cost just because of that. I think the fact that each little bag has only 90 calories is the biggest draw of all because they make a great snack with very little impact on my diet (unless, of course, I eat a whole caseful, which is tempting, since they taste so yummy).The only reason I gave them only four stars is that I think they are still a bit pricey. Each small bag has only .85 oz of product in it, and even with superb Amazon pricing, that's expensive per bag. But. . .but. . .factor in taste, ingredients, and relatively low sugar content, and I'm there.Enjoy!"
5,Awesome Review!,I needed to take Calc II and it had been eight years since I took Calc I (and almost failed). I read this book a couple weeks before my Calc II class and ended up with an A!
5,Excellent for review,This book is well written and the author explains the material in an easy to understand manner. I haven't had Calculus for over 10 years and a lot of the material is coming back to me because of the author's style of presenting it. I whole-heartedly recommend this review for those who have been away from Calculus for a number of years.
5,Perfect for Calculus Brush-Up,"I took Calculus in college and I got an A. But I went so long without doing it that I became rusty, to say the least. I eventually reached the point where I wanted to teach Calculus but I was intimidated by the 500 page (or more) books out there. I came across this book by Gootman, and my problem was solved! The book reads like a novel. The topics came back to me immediately due to the clear way he presents them. While this book is certainly not AP level, I was able to use the foundation that this book gave me in order to teach myself AP Calculus. So I can honestly say that I would probably not be teaching AP Calculus right now had it not been for this book.I only wish there were books out there like this for EVERY topic in existence!"
2,Too many textual errors.,It is evident that the book must have been translated into English because of the frequent misuse of grammer. This English version of the book also contains too many textual errors. The bond graph novice will not find this book of any value because the large amount of errors beg the question as to whether what was written is an accurate representation of the bond graph methodology. The book is better suited for the person who understands bond graphs and can sift through any errors that might exist.
3,Too much filler,"For ""mature"" acts with ties deep into the 1960's singles were passe while albums were considered the be the true art form. CSN do not prove such a philosophy valid with this album which has two great songs in ""Wasted On The Way,"" and the spectacular ""Southern Cross,"" (both hit singles - coincidence? I think not) a pair of passable album cuts with ""Into The Darkness"" and ""Daylight Again Suite,"" all surrounded by forgettable filler. But then again, whether with Neil Young or not, this ""supergroup"" has always hand a tendency to follow this same formula. Perhaps they should have stuck to singles after all."
3,Stills at his best and Nash energetic as all get out,yes - seeing David sweating bullets due his drug abuse is very disconcerting and it is obvious that Stills and Nash have to carry the day and limit David's contributions (how little they may be)...watch the CSN Solo Acoustic Concert from the early 90's and what a relief and a joy it is to see and hear Crosby back among the living and performing at a level not seen since the late 60's and early 70's heyday of the boys ...I saw CSN last summer at the Orpheum Theatre in Minneapolis and David was the strongest singer and performer of the three ...I respect and appreciate Stills for his gritty effort at performing at the level that he did and it is too bad that his vocals have not worn well - get his Just Roll Tape from 1968 and re-appreciate what a virtuoso songwriter and bluesman that he was back in the day
3,"Oldie but Goodie,? I don't think so!",Very disapointing and Stils was the worst. No voice left for this one. I guess that they needed the money. I will watch it again but with my finger on the jump button. They really needed Neil Young. Buy Woodstock and see them at their best.
3,No Nash,"Graham Nash is no front man. I can see from this production that is why Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young ended. It should have been Crosby, Stills, Taylor, and Young. Remember Dallas Taylor?"
5,Another Great CD From Three Righteous Singer/Songwriters,"DAYLIGHT AGAIN is yet another great CD from Crosby, Stills & Nash. Many of the songs here have lyrics that describe the horrors of ANY kind of addiction (these were clearly aimed by Stephen Stills and Graham Nash at bandmate David Crosby, who was at his drug-addled worst at the time), and inspired me to hang up pictures of attractive female celebrities as a deterrent to self indulgence. Other songs are about escaping the past, and inspired me to make looking good for these celebrities a higher priority than food-related reunions at my old school. The fact that CSN (and Y), like virtually all 60s/70s/early 80s rock artists (except Cat Stevens) believe that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia since 2005 for drug-smuggling was wrongfully convicted makes DAYLIGHT AGAIN an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."
2,What a disappointing album,"The band had splintered. Crosby was in full crash and burn mode. The trio's harmonies had always been their greatest strength, but they felt it necessary to pump up the vocals with ringers (Tim B. Schmidt and Art Garfunkel). The songwriting was their weakest yet as a trio. There is a total of three good songs (""Delta,"" ""Southern Cross,"" and ""Wasted on the Way""). The fact that their subsequent albums are actually worse isn't much of a recommendation.Skip this one. Buy their first album, Deja vu, 4-Way Street, and CSN. If you want more, pick up some of their solo albums."
3,Manufacturing fault with DVD,"The DVD is exactly what I expected, except during song 14 ""Suite : Judy blue eyes"" The sound and picture freezes for about 10 seconds starts again then repeats then moves on to the rest of the material. If you are prepared to replace the DVD I would be gratefull if you could have it checked out before sending it because this could be a fault on the master DVD/TAPE it was copied from. There absolutly NO scratches or faults I can see on the DVD and I have tried it on several DVD players with exactly the same result.Regards Ed Colley"
5,better sound,I have a few scratches on my copy and needed a new copy so I got this one which is called a HDcd copy with 4 extra songs. I had both in cd changer and WOW the sound difference is big! the old sounds tired this is alive with highs and base.
2,no fun,"well, I love hanoi rocks old albums, and I love twelve shots, but this album is below there standard, sounds like a decent mike monroe album not a hanoi rocks album, best track is a cover of phil lynotts dear miss lonely hearts and worst is reggea rocker (the worst song they have ever recorded), I really wanted this album to be great, but it's not, sorry"
5,Excellent product,"I was worried about the physical size, this sodimms are a 1/4 of inch taller than the originals on my HP pavilion DV1000, but they fit perfectly, were recognize immediately and going from 512 Mb to 2 GB made a huge difference in my Laptop, just remember always to increase your paging size also."
5,THANK GOD!,"I am incredibly pleased with this product!I have a very old computer, and this made the speed a whole new experience.I only purchased one, but I will be purchasing another, because this product is great.I highly recommend IF IT IS THE CORRECT RAM FOR YOUR COMPUTER!Sometimes you have to do a lot of research to find the correct RAM (I had to!), but you need to be sure it is the RIGHT one."
4,Great memory from a top manufacturer,Just a solid chip from a major maker. I've always had great luck with Crucial products and would definitely buy again!
5,Worked like a charm,Bought it for a Dell laptop. It recognized the new memory right away. No problems.
4,1GB DDR SODIMM,"I ordered and installed two of these modules into a Compaq Persario notebook which only had 500 MB (2 x 256MB) previously.After installing the two Crucial 1GB modules, the notebook booted right upand runs much faster when I have lots memory hungry applications running.Now, if only I could upgrade the CPU..."
4,Like a new system,"I upgraded my Compaq Presario V5210US with a total of 512mb RAM, replacing the two 256mb units with a couple of these 1gb modules. The difference was immediately obvious. Start up has never taken less time & multiple internet pages, even streaming media, are no problem. My only complaint is that from the time I ordered until the time of shipment, the price on this & similar items fluctuated by the day. At one point, the Kingston model went from $12 more to $7 less than the Crucial I went with. That would have saved me $15 on my order!"
2,might as well have installed banana chips,"I recently installed the CT 12864 into my iBook G4 laptop. I see no change in operation. Does the emperor wear no clothes? Have I installed something fake? My computer recognizes it, and says the GB are increased, but alas, no improvement."
2,"Good product, good price but awful purchasing experience","I ordered this product on September 29, selecting the free super saver shipping option. The product finally arrived on October the 16th. Tracking the shipping of the product was not easy either since some of the links did not work as anticipated. One of the puzzles of this ordeal is why the product spent close to one week at a post office less than 50 miles from my home. The product works fine and the price was excellent but the whole purchasing experience was not worth the hassle."
1,50/50,i bought two off these one is working fine and the other stooped after 6 months.the choice is your to buy or notM
1,Very risky,"about 5 months after I bought it my computer started getting blue screen errors. I didnt know what that meant, i thought it was a virus, and i tried to run my virus scans, but it kept on shutting off earlier and earlier so that i couldnt even start windows. Now i was really desperate cuz i thought for sure my whole drive was corrupted so i formatted the c drive (I thought i had my important stuff backed up, but it turns out I lost many important things). still didnt help. then i found out that crucial memory is famous for this. To be honest when i called crucial they did exchange it for a new one, but i wasnt willing to risk it anymore so i got a different one. Beware!"
5,Crucial 1 Gb DDR memory upgrade,I received this product inserted it into my computer and have been running without problems ever since. Excellent product.
5,Exactly what I needed!,"Prompt delivery, the right product and exactly as described. What more could I ask for!"
2,Fitting Problem,"The device was specked correctly, but when I tried to fit it into the socket, I found that the memory module was keyed incorrectly and would not fit the socket. I had to return it due to not being physically compatible. Later I purchased a PNY memory module with the same specifications and it dropped into place with no effort."
5,memory upgrade for dell inspiron 5160,"Works great! Easy to install and inexpensive. Made my laptop run much faster. I couldn't be more happy, and I plan to do the same to another laptop."
1,Bad For Powerbook,"Do NOT use this chip in G4 Powerbooks. Causes constant kernel panics, makes the computer unusable."
5,Works great & makes my old laptop a lot faster.,"I bought 2 of these for my Dell Inspiron 9200. Originally, this computer came with 2 512MBs (1 GB). 1 GB just got too slow for me. Thanks to these it now has 2 GB (1GB x 2). The security programs scan a lot faster. Great price. These 9200s don't need the ram that Dell sells on its web site for almost twice as much. Crucial works just fine.I would not call myself a computer expert by any means, and even I could do this. Just make sure you know what fits in your computer and the max upgradeable ram it takes before buying. I researched this for a while. This ram works great!"
5,Great value,Memory works great and is an inexpensive upgrade that made my old laptop quick again. Very easy to install.
5,Great product,Does the job great; my old laptop is running much faster these days. Hard to believe it originally only came with 256mbs when I bought it. WinXp is a memory hog!!!
5,New RAM for computer,This it has worked great. My first order was for the wrong item and Amazon's return policy is flawless. I am very satisfied
5,Well worth it!,"I installed this memory chip in a 5-year-old Toshiba laptop, and it made a world of difference. The difference in speed is very noticeable, and the overall stability of the computer has increased. I can't even tell that the memory is used! Upgrading memory is a very simple task, and it is a great way to breathe new life into an old computer. Amazon was also a great place to buy, as always. I was not able to find the type of memory required on other computer parts sites. I would recommend Amazon to anyone."
5,A World Of Difference,"I installed two 1GB pieces of this memory in a Dell Inspiron 8500 with 512MB of RAM, and it made a world of difference. The memory was reasonably priced and came very well packaged."
5,Almost perfect,The only negative was some difficulty getting it out of the plastic container. It was wedged in so tightly I was afraid of damaging the module.
5,Perfect for my 2005 G4 iBook,This was exactly what I needed for my old 2005 G4 iBook. It was very easy to install and it increased my computer's speed.
4,works fine,"I needed to extend the life of an aging laptop. I wish this model of RAM cam in more than 1GB, but I'll take what I can get. It was enough to prevent some of the crashing I was experiencing with some programs. Definitely improved the responsiveness of Adobe Acrobat. Alone it isn't enough to keep from needing to upgrade soon."
3,Polishing cloth is not that great.,I recently bought this polishing cloth and all I can say is that you get what you pay for.It is large but it is very thin and doesn't have much of the polish in it. It works ok and is worth the money. I'm just disappointed and should have spent more money to get a better one.
5,Great for me,"I use these cloths for polishing my 22-250 rifle brass, as I am too cheap to buy a tumbler lol. You can polish a lot of brass with one cloth! These work good for me to polish brass while sitting around watching TV."
2,Outdated Polishing Cloth?,"The item arrivied quickly in a matter of four or five days. The quality of the cloth is suspect in that it appears stale and does not perform as I had hoped it would. I am still using a liquid product, BRASSO, and then polishing with the cloth. End cost of the cloth was $10.00 with shipping. A can of BRASSO is a buck and a half and old T shirts cost zero. Perhaps the cloths have out-lived their shelf lives."
2,I've used Better...,"This product worked ok, but I have used Polishing Cloths that clean better then this one. I guess it does a good enough job. Although I don't think I would buy this particular cloth again."
4,Great for removing tarnish from jewelry,I finally wore out another cloth I had been using. This is a large cloth - so I expect it will last me quite awhile. I use this cloth to keep the jewelry that is on display in my store bright and shiny. We are near the beach - so things can tarnish quickly. It is easy to use and doea a great job.
3,Good size cloths,"These are nice polishing cloths. I did not like how they were sewn together and dont know why they were. But i only gave it 3 stars because they claim one cloth has chemicals already on it for cleaning or polishing .. and i did not see any difference when just using the cloths with no actual other cleaners.. There are white and blue colored cloths , one that suppose to have a cleaner on it and the other to polish, BUT they dont clean or polish alone.. They are however nice cloths as they are, they are big and if use a brass cleaner with (for example) they work very great!"
5,These guys are fast!,I ordered these cool silver polishing cloths to be sent ordinary mail two days before xmas and received them the very next day. Pretty impressive!
3,It's okay,"Reasonable price and okay product. as information shows , I thought this is a large cloth. However, doesn't look large."
3,two pieces sewn together into one bigger piece,"Two pieces sewn together into one bigger piece, it's OK product, but I didn't find it to be very effective"
2,"Sort of works, sometimes.",I do not recommend. Silver foam and creams work MUCH better than this polishing cloth.
1,Horrible,"Not worth one red cent. Don't bother, only made jewelry WORSE! Wish I could get my money back for this. Now I'm stuck with a smelly blue rag that does nothing!"
2,Not as great as using the liquids,It essentially rubbed off the tarnish from my jewelry onto my hands. Once used there doesn't seem to be a way to reuse the same areas. Can't get into the nooks of some of my more detailed jewelry and actually left a piece of cloth wedged in my Tiffany mesh bracelet :-( The liquids seem to work better.
4,Viewing the total experience,"The Battle for Wake Island inspired a nation after the horrendous loss at Pearl Harbor. This is a remarkable compilation of first hand experiences, both by the author and the men of all ranks who fought alongside. The smoke and haze of battle prohibits any one person from experiencing the whole. Cunningham cleverly weaves the stories and memoirs of his fellow Wake Island defenders into tapestry that gives a remarkable vision of this heroic defense.Taken as prisoners, the men were enslaved in the highly profitable Japanese War machinery, enriching companies like Mitsui and Hitachi. The savagery and endless brutality of the Japanese against the POWS became an a living hell. Truly, Cunningham has written the personal answers of so many to the question: ""What really happened to these gallant men?""Regrettably, little is said of the gallantry of the civilian construction company employees, many of whom were equally gallant defenders."
2,A fair read with a new Twist on the Atlantis story,"This is the first in a a series or may be a trilogy about Atlantis' discovery. The Gods are alive and well living in Atlantis, but need a human( the descent of Hercules, no less) to save them. Enter one of the Gods to provide ""guidance"". The ensuing tale is light hearted and moves rather quickly ( read the book in a few hours, but then I read alot) I am not sure if I will pursue this series, not enough substance for my taste. Give a whirl and see what you think."
4,It was a very pleasant surprise!,"I really enjoyed this book. I wasn't sure what to expect when I got this but I have say I was very pleasantly surprised. The book was very fast past and kept me turning the pages. I was captured by the imagery of the adventure, the exotic locations and the excitement. The ending is left open for an obvious sequel and I will definitely be looking for that one. This was a great discovery! I recommend you give it a try."
2,Overall a disappointment,"This book seems pretty one dimensional to me and characters lack depth and the events in the plot just seem to work too well with the characters making huge leaps in logic and the rest of the characters just say OK and go with it. This book does have a few interesting ideas , however they are not enough to save it. This is the first book in a series and as such the ending left purposely open, but I am left with no desire to finish the series... overall I would not recommend this book."
3,Good and Bad,"The good - so far I have been using this software a short time and I really like the practice section.The bad: Hey, I have a high powered PC - what is the deal with the choppy voice audio?And where were the QA testers? The little certificate after the subtraction practice has subtraction spelled wrong... subtarction. It prints it wrong on the screen and the printed output. Come on guys that is an easy one. :) Makes me wonder what else I will run in to that was missed."
2,Big Let Down,Lots of math content but the slow interface and choppy voice reminds you of an early 90's program. Turn the speaker down or leave it up and pretend you are on your old 386 pc. I think I will stick with text books.
2,The light doesn't match the picture,"The plasma ball was definitely small. It was also slightly cracked. These things are very delicate. Lastly, it doesn't give off as much light as the picture says. It's actually quite dim."
2,These two are supposed to be adults?,"This book was about a man who was injured in a mountain climbing accident and his relationship with his physical therapist. Lilah and Adam had been previously acquainted and hated each other tremendously. You'd think this would be a good prelude to a steamy romance, but it was not. Adam speaks to Lilah in such a filthy manner it's a wonder how she ever falls in love with him. It's also a wonder how he ever falls in love with her ~ her character is unbearable. Her ""tough love"" approach should have applied only to his therapy, but it didn't. She had a chip on her shoulder throughout the novel and was obnoxious, angry and downright hostile to Adam. I saw hate all over the place, but never love.This novel was a huge disappointment. I felt the story was rushed and underdeveloped. Brown is a good author, but this wasn't one of her better books. If you're looking for a good romance by Brown, buy SUNNY CHANDLER'S RETURN or LED ASTRAY."
4,as always an excellent read,I always enjoy Sandra Brown. Her characters are funny. I really loved Lilah and Adam. I read the book and it was great I also purchased the tape I just wish this was tape unabridged. Adam and Lilah really learn a lot about themselves. This is a book I will read again and again.
5,adam's fall,The book was very good and I would recommed this book to my friends. Sandra Brown is a good writer and story teller and I will continue reading her books
5,A Favorite,"This is one of my favorite books ever. I really liked Adam and Lilah, and the story about him maybe never walking again touched my heart. I've read it multiple times and I'll read it again, I'm sure. I recommend it to anyone."
2,A Disappointment,"I loved Sandra Brown's ""Mirror Image"", but was extremely disappointed with this effort. This book offered some witty bantering between the two main characters, but the romance was unsatisfying--not nearly enough build-up of believable tension between them. Some of their behavior seemed ludicrous--almost like Brown was forcing conflict. And the writing was not very discriptive. The story is set in Hawaii and yet I had no sense of scenery. A disappointment all the way around."
2,VERY OLD STORY,"DID NOT CARE AT ALL FOR THIS BOOK, sTORY WAS OLD AND YOU KNEW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN BEFORE YOU TURNED THE PAGE, i DID NOT EVEN FINISH THE BOOK,"
3,Misrepresented product,"Beware Amazon and Brennanelectronics product descriptions. I just bought and received an Olympus camera. The sellers descriptionOlympus Stylus 80 Quartz Date 35mm Camera Kit w/ 38-80mm Zoomstated that the camera was new and packaged in a sealed factory box and came with battery, remote and case. When the camera arrived in the mail it was repackaged in a Fry's.com box (the factory is Olympus), the battery was the wrong size and there was no case or remote. I have no way of telling if the camera is new or used. I have not tried the camera yet because I have to go out and buy the proper battery. But I suspect that anything is possible from this seller. Beware!"
5,Exvellent value,"Great music great playing was originally released on three vinyl disksFunk and jazz yet with no cliches. Brian is the original all tried to copy, and in a way you might say that AWB came close, but if you look at the material here(:herbie hancock, marvin gaye, eddie harris and Brian's best tunes) you can begin to understand the difference. I could go into the individual players and cuts, but, if you like Brian you like this. My only complaint is Brian should have taken over more vocals, as Alex Ligertwood,who went on to join Santana, is too hyper. But the grooves are great and keep me moving, in part because of percussion, and Brian proves it is possible to play jazz with a funk accent, without becoming ""jazzy"" or having funk take over."
5,Completely Tranced,If any spin takes the prize it is this one. This is so far the most incredible trance I have ever heard. Smooth and celestial yet poweful and addictive. A must have.
2,Square is not manufactured as described,The square was not manufactured to the described specifications. My square did not have the black etched blade with yellow in the etch marks. It had a plain steel blade with printed on markings. These things are going to wear off. I do not recommend this square for this reason. I don't know why the description on the website is wrong. I guess Stanely has recently changed the design. The square otherwise was just ok. Not perfectly square and a little rough sliding. I buffed the blade a little to get it to slide. I started to file the body to square it up but stopped when I saw the blade changed square when I flipped it over. If I flip it around I can find one side that makes the thing pretty square when checked on the inside square but not to good on the outside square. Flipping it the otherway makes it pretty square on the outside square but not so good on the inside. I have to put some thought into how to remedy this.
1,Not good for me,My phone always came out and fell on the ground. Now the clip itself just broke when i was adjusting my phone! I would recommend a leather case.
3,mick j r,Never saw this series ever until l purchased it not as good as pawn stars Harrison family though l never expected it would be still liked it
4,Donkeys and Dollars,"We like this show, I think I like it better than Pawn Stars, I like the down home folksy people. I will continue to watch. Nice clean entertainment."
5,Perfect for Vulcan800,Obviously made for the application and great when using an upgrade exhaust and K&N air filter. Much tougher to install than the instructions lead you to believe.
1,"Looks nice, but does not work","I installed this light, ran test as per instructions, put all my tools away, then left home being glad that upon my return later I would have light to help me choose the correct door key. After dark, upon returning home, the light would not come on but the led flashed indicating it was seeing movement. It did not respond to the switch either. After 30 minutes of troubleshooting, and reading the manual, it mysteriously came on with the switch but would not turn off automatically. It is now back in its box ready for return. What a disappointment to spend the time on this light; I wish, in addition to swapping the light or refunding my money, that I could get something for the time I spent on the installation."
1,Poor light fixture,The lights have gone out and there is no way to replace them without completely dismantling the light. I am not pleased with this fixture and will not purchase another one ever!!! BAD FIXTURE.
1,DO NOT BUY,"I bought 3 of these last summer and now only one works, and it comes on all the time by itself. I figure the sensors are faulty, the light comes on even in bright sunlight at noon, and sometimes just decides to stay on all day. I absolutly despise this company now and will never purchase another thing from them seeing that I have tried 2 other Heath Zenith models as well. NO GOOD!"
1,I'd give it NO stars if I could!,"This thing is activated by wind, rain, snow - you name it. It's on most of the time unless I shut it off manually, as a result. Called customer service and was told very firmly that this could not be happening. ""It's not built to do that, ma'am,"" or some such nonsense. I'm never buying anything made by this company again."
2,7 Chart Patterns Is an Advertisement,"7 Chart Patterns is an advertisement for their black-box trade idea generator. The software they are selling is about $1,500 plus data feed. If you are going to trade based on chart patterns, the software would save you time. I tried to trade from technicals in the charts for about 3 years with no success so I did not think that method was for me. This book did not change my mind on that. However, it does give a good, although brief, overview of the patterns that it does cover, so if you've never looked at technical charting before, it is a good intro to it. If you are familiar with support and resistance, cup and handle, and the like, don't waste your time."
2,It lasted 4 days,"I received this holter on a Saturday and by Tuesday it fell and the small upper tab that holds the phone in its place broke. Ok, I know I'm not supposed to let this kind of objects fall (specially because it was holding my cell phone when it fell), but come on! 1 lousy fall and that's it? I could make a holster out of Legos and it would last more than that... And it's just not worth the effort to try and return it.I only give it two stars because it was very cheap and while it lasted it achieved the purpose of holding the phone firmly in its place, although a couple of times it cost me a little more than it should to take the phone out of the holster.Now, if you'll excuse me... Where's that super glue tube??..."
3,Cheaply Made!,"I really like having the holster, but the little tab to disengage the phone easily snaps off, rendering the holster useless. I take great care when handling the phone, yet I have still broken two of the things! I am purchasing a third one, and I am not thrilled about it. Without the holster, I must put the phone in my pocket, but then the camera automatically starts snapping pictures..........HOW ANNOYING!While I wouldn't recommend it for durability reasons, its functionality makes it a necessity to have."
3,tv lover,"I just purchased the sony 36"" KV36fs100 and am looking for a stand. I actually saw this one in the store. It LOOKS great and seems very high quality and sturdy, but not if you have children. The silver metal details to the left and right of the front of this design are flimsy pieces of plastic that pop on and off. If you even touch it to examine it, it wiggles and bends. I am dissapointed with Sony, and have been looking into other alternatives, as a curious kids would have those pieces popped off and broken in a matter of moments. But if all you care about is looks, fit, and a sturdy place to rest your tv, I think its fine."
2,A personal memoir of the author,"This book was not a complete waste of time. You do learn about the author's experience in a particular type of fantasy baseball league, but it leaves a lot to be desired. He does not really instruct the reader in how to make themselves a better fantasy baseball owner. This was my first year in fantasy baseball and had to really learn as I went. This book was not a big help. I could find out how to play from the rules of the game I played. I need a book that covers various types and variations of fantasy leagues, Challenge, Roto, 5X5, Sabermetrics, and fantasy point types. If you are new to fantasy baseball I guess it gives you a look at one owner in one league, but you really have to talk to other owners, and read all kinds of tip-sheets and articles on ESPN.com and other fantasy sites. It's a lot bigger world than the author lets you in on."
5,Great Value,"It's a great durable square. The numbers were very easy to read. I purchased this item as I am a new homeowner and I think it's perfect for homeowners to use when performing carpentry tasks that the wife gives you. Amazon had the best price for it. I like buying products that were made in the USA too.On a side note, I'm not sure who shipped it, but they put a sticker on it that read Amazon but didn't peel right off. It was more of an inconvenience than anything."
1,Marking is poorly aligned,"The markings were punched in roughly 1/16 off from the corners, so it is impossible to make precise measurements. I should have just visited a hardware store to be sure the tool wouldn't just cause headaches."
4,Carpenters Square,"Nice square, a lot of info on it, but lacks the 1/12 markings and no hole to hang. Very light and easy to handle. Hope it is sturdy."
4,45-300 Aluminum Square,"Good light weight item. Be careful not to bend as it is not ridgid enough to withstand much pressure. Otherwise, a good tool to have in your possession."
4,Light Weight,"My old steel squares needed some help!I had cleaned them up, but moving,rust and some not so tender handlinghad left them hard to read.Love the light weight, but remember tohandle these aluminum with care."
4,Lightweight and square..and cheap,Does what it's supposed to do. Arrived square and still is to this day. I think it's a must for any DIY inventory.
2,Arrived bent,"This carpenter's square would be fine if only both arms lay in the same plane, but the packaging didn't protect the long arm against bending. I've straightened it out well enough for the job at hand (assembling shelves) but if I expected to need it for more than this job, I would return it."
2,It's all downhill for Ted after this album,"Take it from me...Ted Nugent is my favorite guitarist. But this album was a turning point in the wrong direction for him. ""Ted Nugent"", ""Free For All"", and ""Cat Scratch Fever"" were classics, when Derek St. Holmes was with the band. ""Weekend Warriors"", ""State of Shock"", and ""Scream Dream"" were also great, although you began to hear a little bit of the pretty boy 80's lyrics that were about to ensue. ""Intensities In Ten Cities"" was the last good album Ted put out (it's live). Then came ""Nugent"". Don't get me wrong; this album is better than ""Predator"" (1984). That album was so bad I sold it halfway through the tracks. I am going so sell this one soon. The only good song is ""Tailgunner"". The rest sounds like Lover Boy, Poison, etc. Interestingly, in changing his style, he did predict the raunchy bleach-blond 80's mainstream rock. Unfortunately, it sucks. This album sounds way too sober for a rock star."
4,still sounds good,"I just bought the CD, popped it in, and the memories of twenty seven years come right back. This is great guitar, vocals, etc. Sure, each track isn't ""Stranglehold"" , but come on, you got ""Tail Gunner"" ""Bound and Gagged"", etc.Great stuff, thanks Ted!"
2,MOTORCITY GARBAGE,"THE ONLY REASON THIS ALBUM GETS TWO STARS IS BECAUSE THE SOLOS ARE GREAT. THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE END, WHY DID HE CHANGE HIS SOUND? THIS IS GARBAGE, AVOID AT ALL COST"
4,Great Game for Grand Children,"The Wooden Game set Checkers, Chess is great, its made of solid wood and very strong for young children to knock around."
1,Lies. This is NOT Staunton brand,"I was ver disappointed by the outright lie. It is called a Staunton Set but in fact it is no brand. I would not have purchased it. As I live overseas, postage is too high for me to return. Amazon has a lot to answer for."
1,"Don't buy this, you will not get what you paid for...","This thing is advertised as a ""Stafford"" padfolio. I have purchased Stafford items before, and their quality standards are very good. HOWEVER, what I got in the mail when I ordered this, was a very cheap chinese made imitation, it doesn't even have a brandmake on it. What a rip off."
3,Not bad,"The book was not bad. I am not sorry I read it. I thought the character, Gail, was a bit ridiculous in her search for her daughter's killer. She was willing to lose everything, including a wonderful husband and daughter, over this obsession of hers. It was really getting to me. The ending was merely an ending. I felt it was anticlimactic. Like I said, the book is fine, but it is not one of those books I would say to someone, ""You have GOT to read this!""."
2,Disturbing,"This is the first of Ms. Fielding's books I've read, and it will probably be the last. I found the characters to be pushing the envelope of unbelievability, and the plot line was nearly disturbing. While I'm sure the pain of losing a child to murder in unbearable, to me it seemed like the book came very close to promoting suicide and vigilante justice. Granted, the book was written in 1984 and much has changed since then. I just couldn't get past the yucky (for lack of a better word) feeling when I finished the book."
2,"Oddly gripping, but mostly just bad.",I didn't dislike Gail-- I actually think that one of the things Fielding did decently was create a portrait of a woman gone mad with grief. Hence the extra star on what really is a one-star novel...What I did dislike was that it was poorly written. It was often wooden and jerky in style. It read like it was written far too quickly.Skip this one.
3,"Easy read, terrible ending","""Life Penalty"" was a fairly easy read, although a little far-fetched. Jack was too patient, Jennifer to perfect, and Gail just plain too obsessed. I was pleased to see that the police knew what she was doing and that they weren't portrayed as incompetent, but didn't Jack ever phone home during the day and wonder where his wife was? Didn't Jennifer mention coming home to an empty house to him? I also thought the ending was terrible - I understand why she did what she did and even that it wasn't important to the reader to know what the results of her actions would be, but I thought it unreasonable to expect that the reader would accept the fact that other characters reacted the way they did. I enjoyed the book to the extent that I would read future books by this author, but not enough to give it a ringing endorsment."
3,Not bad,"This book was OK. The way the mother looks for her daughter's killer, I thought, was a little far-fetched. I liked the way the book ended. On the whole, the book wasn't bad, I would recommend it."
4,"Gripping, well written......","I picked this hardcover up during the 80's when it first came out and I enjoyed the read. Sure some of this sounds far-fetched but Joy Fielding along with Mary Higgins Clark were at the top of women writers in the 80's given readers chilling suspense and a good fast read. It seems now a days all these stories they wrote about so well, have been put through the mill and rehashed a million times over. I guess when you look back they may seem somewhat tame and maybe even dull compared to what they write about these days but I still remember this story and reading it till 4AM till finished and enjoying it, thats what readings about. Its really not as bad as many of the reviewers claim."
5,The way a blues voice should be,Len Here!I don't have this record but have many of the song's.He's one of my favorite pre-war blues singer's.When itcome's to true raw blues he is the man. For me T.JOHNSONE.JAMES do it the way it should be done.Bless the Blues! Len
4,"Great, and almost complete","Recording heartfelt music like this was a real gamble back in the 78 rpm era - we owe a debt of gratitude to the folks at Paramount who recorded blues singers like Johnson, as well as the folks who reissue these priceless recordings so we can enjoy them today.That said, in a recent record auction (Nauck's, specifically), a test pressing of a heretofore unknown Tom Johnson recording has surfaced. Whoever was high bidder hopefully will share this with the reissuer and they can augment what is already a great collection. Until then, just know that this particular CD was complete as far as they knew at the time of issue."
5,One of the Most Unique of the Early Blues Players,"Tommy Johnson and Charlie Patton are perhaps two of the most unique and innovative rural blues players to have ever lived. As where Patton's style is coarse and rough, Johnson's style (at least when he is at his best) is incredibly smooth. Also Johnson's unique falsetto (which is yodel like at times) is amazing. These recordings bare witness to his talent even after nearly a century. It is a shame that these recordings are all that there is."
1,Disappointed,"I bought, what I thought, was a real DVD of the Dean Martin Roasts. Turns out it is just someone who made a homemade DVD off of a tape. Extremely disappointing and misleading."
2,not so great,Forgets the time and date often (which is a problem inasmuch as the whole point of a programmable thermostat is based on time and date)....and does so for no appearant reason.After 1< service it threw up an error code and died.Bought another brand (non-programmable) and i'm pleasedWould not buy this one again.
1,Temperature hold.,"I purchased the Hunter #44110 from Lowes hardware May 1, 2007. The first control, which was replaced within weeks, did not hold the temperature set for a given period. In other words, if set to AC to come on at 80, the reading could be much highter without it having turned the AC on. Same for the heat. If set to say 76, the reading could be much lower without it having turned the heat on. Didn't experience this problem through testing the setting with the second Hunter right away but now the same situation is being experienced. I do not recommend this particular control module by model number."
4,easy as 123,I found it very easy to install. Programming is a breeze. Works great. The only thing is it didn't fit on the wall exactly like my old one. I did have to very slightly patch the wall.
3,"Good, but very poor ESD protection","This is a decent thermostat. It is easy to install and fairly easy to program, but if you live in a dry climate like Albuquerque, you should think twice about getting this thermostat. It has very poor electro-static discharge (ESD) protection. I have ""killed"" three of them just by walking up and touching the buttons. I have two installed in my house and I like the horizontal form factor. At first it seemed easier to just buy another one to replace a dead one without having to instal a new bracket, etc. Two days ago, I killed another one and am tired of it. I will be looking for a different thermostat."
4,Basic Thermostat,This is good basis thermostat. Nothing fancy but it does the job at a good price. Like the preprogrammed energy savings.
3,Great product for the price,"I received it in a timely manner, and the install of it was very easy. Works well."
1,Worked for a week,"This product was great for a week but hasn't worked since. The thermostat won't cool my house anymore. I even had the A/C guys out here twice b/c I thought my A/C unit was broken. It's not. I'll set the temp. at 75 degrees and the temp. in the house will read 83. It'll maybe cool the house to 80. It's never cool in our house anymore. Also, the display doesn't light up. I can't recommend this product."
1,I wouldn't install it if it was free,"I've replaced two of these. The way the thermostat snaps into its base is a bad design. It doesn't necessarily make good contact with the base. Our fan would come on, but not the rest of the AC. They're controlled by separate wires, one made contact the other didn't. If I pushed on the thermostat with my thumb, the AC comes on until I let go.There is no reason to buy a defective design. Other brands have similarly priced similarly featured units without the removable thermostat that might not turn the AC fully on."
1,Pain in the neck,"I do not like this thermostat at all. At my other home, we had a Honeywell which was much easier to use. I wish I had gone with a Honeywell this time."
4,A Gripping Thriller!,"""Dead Of Winter"" is a great movie to view on a dark, lonely night. Steenburgen is marvelous as a would-be actress trying out for the part of her life in an old house in upstate New York. She soon finds herself a pawn in a blackmail plot, and later, realizes that her captives have no desire to let her live to tell of her experience. During the entire movie, a blizzard swirls and the wind moans outside the old house where she is being held, and this erie atmosphere, together with the periodic plot twists will definitely make your skin crawl."
3,Mary Steenburgen gives a good performance,Mary Steenburgen's performance in this film is good.The scenes in the movie are dark with some filmed duringa snow storm which gives the picture a creepy feel. Strongstory line and a surprise ending. A couple good scares duringthe movie make it worth buying. This film is one you will watchmore than once.
4,Dead od Winter,Great movie...came out years ago and watched it all the time..Mary Steenburgen plays three different caracters and Roddy McDowell is priceless.Be sure to settle in and watch this classic thriller on a cold winter afternoon.
4,Classic Mystery/Horror Genre,"Dead of Winter is what a cross between the horror and mystery genre should be. It is the kind of movie that keeps you on your feet every time that you watch it and it has an in depth mystery which has a complexity to it that involves plot turns that makes one think. The characterization is one fitting for a movie of this genre.The story is about a young actress who is hired to play a part. However, the person who hired her happens to have kept from her some very important details about what here role really pertains. Slowly, the secrets behind the fact that she looks like a very particular person comes to light and she finds herself fighting to stay alive.This movie is not for younger viewers, due to the fact that the movie does in fact have its violent elements. The cinematography has dark lighting which adds to the effect and is on par to what is expected of the late 80's. It is worth ones time simply because it is a classic."
3,Body Triple...,"Mary Steenburgen (TIME AFTER TIME) plays multiple roles in this somewhat clunky thriller. Her various characters face off against the nefarious duo of Roddy McDowall (PLANET OF THE APES, THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE) and Jan Rubes (BLOOD RELATIONS) as scheming sociopaths. While DEAD OF WINTER isn't the best suspense story ever committed to film, it is a lot of fun to watch. Everyone devours the scenery, w/ McDowall hamming it up to beat the band! Rubes gets his chance to shine during the finale, especially during his death scene! His histrionics surpass even the great Bill T. Shatner! Amazing!..."
4,Wonderfully Entertaining,"As a recent ""come-here"" to the Virginia Hunt Country, I found The Middleburg Mystique fascinating, entertaining, and even enlightening. Thank God I read it, because some of its real-life characters are now my clients. It was good to have some insight! And for those interested in the lifestyles and history of the Virginia horsey set, it's a must-read!"
4,sweet and gentle,"This peek into Middleburg is extremely entertaining. It's as sweet and gentle as a maiden aunt and even the scandals are touched on with delicacy. So, if you're looking for another Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil this is NOT the book for you. I really enjoyed this lighthearted peek into the Hunt Country."
3,So So,I enjoying visiting Middleburg and had hopes for this one but for some reason it didn't keep my attention. The section about the Kennedy's was interesting and of course what would Middleburg be without a few sex scandals. Ended up just browsing through this one instead of reading it cover to cover which is surprising because the other reviewers mostly seemed to like it.
5,Lyrical Tale of Beautiful town,What a lovely story of a small town and its big-named and ordinary residents!
4,Saves the good stuff for part two,"While Works 1 was a long drawn out affair, Works 2 is much better.The songs on '2' are much better. Emerson tracks such as 'Maple Leaf Rag' and 'Down' are instantly more enjoyable than what was offered on '1' while the ballad 'Watching over you' is instantly mroe touching than anything on the previous album. Also, 'So far to fall' and 'Brain Salad Surgery' are much more fun than any of the ""rockers"" that Lake came up with on the first installment of works. The Carl Palmer tracks are good too.Highlights include 'When The apple blossoms bloom...', 'Brain Salad Surgery', 'Down', 'bullfrog', 'So far to fall' and my favourite 'Watching over you'. They help cap off a fairly diverse set of enjoyable songs."
3,A few good tunes but a lot of filler,"I bought this in conjunction with Works 1, which I would have to say is clearly the superior album. It is nice to have the set, but if you only want or can afford one or the other, pick Works 1."
2,Not really into it,"Although Works is a masterpiece, I was not attracted to Works 2 in any way. ELP is a trio that you must either love or hate, but I somewhat manage to be in the middle.I like their early stuff, specially Tarkus (who doesn't?), and Works is a great album (have it on vinyl and CD). But Works 2 is not at the same level, IMHO. I won't go into details here, just will say that it is nice to have it in my collection, but not an album that I'll be going back any time soon."
1,Works 2,The beginning of the end for ELP. When a major band can release a mediocre album and get away with it shows how little they actually care for the audience.
2,Not much of a followup to One,"I'm sitting here listening to this album after lord knows how many years. It is not ELP at its best if you like the psychedelic/progressive rock that these guys are famous for. It is a collection of, as another reviewer mentioned, ""outtakes"" (if you will), of lesser stuff than they were capable of. It has a nice collection of ragtime music and honkytonk piano, but it ""ain't"" ELP for me. But lets face it, not everyone loves prog rock. The intent of Vol 1 was to highlight each artist individually and then do it as a 3some. It worked for me in a big way. I saw them on tour after vol. 1 and it worked great live too. This vol2 falls well short for me. So if you like the honky-tonk sound and the ragtime beat, pick this up. If your looking for the ""big and deep prog rock"" sound ELP is famous for, pass this one by.Ciao"
4,Like their music,"I am enjoying their music, and decided to purchase both Works albums. I am happy with purchase."
1,Waste of Vinyl,"I confess to being at a disadvantage writing this review because I didn't finish listening to the record. I couldn't. It just made me so depressed. I thought, this is one of the great bands of the 70's, reduced to pablum? At that time I didn't realize that this was an ""outtakes"" album. That might be an excuse, but it doesn't make it any better."
3,Gilbert & Sullivan buff,"I enjoyed the presentation but it was a far cry from the Doyle O'Carte version. The voices are good, but the staging was quite different than I expected."
4,SWEET SOUND OF THE SEVENTIES,"Roberta Flack's presence in the 70s established her as one of the prime divas of that decade. You couldn't turn on the radio without hearing such smash hits as KILLING ME SOFTLY, FIRST TIME EVER I SAW YOUR FACE, THE CLOSER I GET TO YOU, JESSE, WHERE IS THE LOVE and FEEL LIKE MAKING LOVE. Flack sang from the heart, with little drama or bombast. Her soulful voice endeared her to millions of fans and she had a dominant presence at the height of her career.This collection includes her biggest hits plus a few lesser known tracks and is a solid representation of Ms. Flack's legacy."
4,"Good book, bad price.","I intend to major in Biochem, so this book might not be enough, but so far it's suit me quite well. Sometimes I feel like the book doesn't go deep enough into some areas, but in the other hand it covers a wide range of things..."
1,Cannot turn and overheats,"The item sits in one spot. I was hoping that it would be able to turn. Also, my laptop overheats when using this product."
4,COOL!,"I really like this pad. It's very effective and portable. It goes wherever my NETBOOK goes. Sometimes I use it....sometimes I don't, but it's still handy to have just in case."
1,..HMmm I don't really know,"Be careful when ordering this item. If you leave in the NJ area don't expect to get this in the mail. I ordered it twice and both times got a flat, electricity-guzzling USB powered cooling pad that was not anywhere close to being the item I ordered (this one, with the three adjustable positions)!! Way to go amazon. I can't write a review for the item because I've never been able to use it!"
3,can't use it on lap,"can't use it on lap, does work to reduce heat very welll, does not swivel but the description never said that it would but would be nice for desktop"
4,Cooling Pad does as advertised.,"This product is just as advertised. It is lightweight so goes with you easily and definately keeps the laptop cool. The only thing I haven't liked is that the little rubber pads on the bottom that keep the cooling pad from sliding when used on a tabletop, have fallen off and will not restick."
3,Is the cooling pad hot?,"This is a decent little cooling pad. Why do they call it a cooling pad though? It doesn't cool anything--it should just be called a riser pad... but I digress. This pad fits my 15"" Macbook Pro just fine. A nice surprise that I didn't see on the description is that it rotates which is a nice little touch. The riser bar on the back is a bit flimsy feeling, and startled me when it cracked into place raising it the first time. There are a couple of springs underneath that pull a bar toward the center of the pad to adjust the height on the bar in one of three grooves. This makes it a little awkward to get it to the right setting.All that said, I just bought this for those occasional times where I like to watch a movie in bed and believe it will be perfect for that."
4,Good movie,"This movie was fun to watch although rather predictable. The cinematography seemed a bit on the ""cheap"" side but kids wouldn't notice. I do not know the rating of the movie, but I would say it is appropriate for all ages, even the wee little ones if they can manage to sit still long enough. Our tween daughter loved the movie, along with every other tween girl in the country, I bet. Glad to see it is available on DVD for Xmas gift giving."
4,A cute movie,I thought it was a nice family movie. The troubled teen finds passion and commitment in a challenging and eco minded way. It was interesting to see the issues faced by an animal trying to addapt to a loss of part of their body.
5,Dolphin Tale,"This is a wonderful movie. The story line is beautiful. The actors were marvelous. This movie should be viewed by all audiences. Children of all ages will fall in love with this movie. It is funny, sad, loving and an excellent movie. I would highly recommend this movie for all ages."
5,Dolphin Tale,This is a good family movie and is based on a true story. It is a heart-warming story about a dolphin that has a severe injury and how people working together help the dolphin and in turn it helps them.
5,"A dolphin, cute kids, and hope","What happens when students become engaged in learning? Miracles, that's what happens. Providing a child with a focal point outside of themselves and what how much they will push themselves (and others!) to do the impossible. Bringing love into a life is just one ingredient in happiness. Watch the movie and begin a love affair!"
5,Great film and great memories,"Watched this movie over Christmas while my daughter was visiting me and since she lives right down the street from Clearwater Marine Aquarium, we agreed to go see Winter when I came to visit. Flew down last month and we did just that. Just like the movie - well, that figures since most of it was shot at the marina. Winter was soooooo cute! She whistles all the time and LOVES people. I even got to hold her prosthetic tail, which is her 18th one they told me. Anyway, the movie just brings back such good memories. And it's a really good movie - not just saying that because I've been there. I always love anything Morgan Freeman does, as well as Ashley Judd. All the actors were excellent! What an amazing story - you will not be sorry you purchased this DVD."
4,Good family movie,"Good story line based on a true true event, but a little deep for the younger kids. These are my thoughts."
4,Family film fare,"This is a great family film. Gets you involved and knowing it is based on fact, makes it even more interesting. Real nice film"
4,Great family movie.,"My kids aged 11,9,8 loved this film and so did my wife and I. If you can find it on sale like I did purchase it you won't be disappointed."
5,Dolphin Tale,"My grandchild, age 7, was completely entranced! Sawyer became her hero. Emily was rooting for the dolphin to move its tail in the right way. She actually stood up and moved her arms up and down."
4,Christmas gift,How can you go wrong when the kids put exactly what they want on a list! This is a cute movie.
4,A Good Story,Dolphin Tale is wonderful story. The movie touches your heart strings. It gives you a sense of what can be accomplished with a little effort and imagination. I highly recommend this movie to all who have an open mind and have a love for animals.
4,PICTURE QUALITY,"I heard about this movie and also got a chance to see the trailer online; thus, I ordered it. I was not aware that it was actually a copy from somewhere else. The quality was very poor."
5,More than a story,"The Dolphin Tale is a quiet movie with a loud message, but one has to listen to hear it. Filmed in Clearwater Florida and the adjacent area, it is a story of a Dolphin in trouble; a young boy goes to to save him and gets some adult help to achieve the goal.The story goes further, it is about the disabled being helped and placed in a productive role for a return to their community. Sitting with Winter, the Dolphin's name, I had the pleasure of sensing the spirit that soared as I say near him. He was ""free"" and he could return to being a positive member of his community once again. Life should not be that busy for you, sit down and take in the good side of life for a moment.Ken Strafer"
5,Fantastic movie,I love purchasing blu-ray disks since a DVD of the movie is always included along with the blu-ray disk in the package. This movie was used but in absolutely perfect condition. Excellent family movie. The blu-ray disk has some special features that are very fun. The special feature pig cartoon is hilarious.
3,good story,"sometimes real life is ssllooww....so is this movie. :) Beautiful filming and exciting for my grandkids. Glad I bought it, will share with other families."
5,Good Movie,This was a good movie for all ages. Sweet story and held my 3 year old's attention for the most part.
5,True story of a dolphin rescue.,"This is a wonderful movie about the true story of a young dolphin in Florida that was rescued from fishing nets but had her tail amputated due to the injury. She was successfully fitted with an prosthetic device and brought back to health. My grandson can relate as he has had some serious surgeries to both legs to enable him to walk and run about. After receiving this DVD from Amazon.com, he earnestly told me, ""Nana, you melt my heart."""
3,Dolphin Tale,NEVER RECIEVED THIS ITEM which was purchased 3/22/2012Order # D01-6247664-6585543Would like to know what has happened with this particular order.Other items ordered that same day came in very quickly.
3,Amazing Story of Adaptation,"This is a heart warming story of an awkward boy who helps save a dolphin from certain death. Although it's a great story, it falls short on the acting end. I think they could have found a better kid to play the lead role as it just felt forced and took away from the story. Mostly poor acting all around, but the saving grace is that it's based on a true story. Good movie for kids."
5,Great family movie,This is a great family movie. It is worth watching. It is an inspirational story. We enjoy the Blu-ray version along with the grand-kids.
5,Great movie for the whole family,"This is such an inspirational movie, especially beacuse it is a true story. The whole family loves it, esp. my 5 year old daughter and 3.5 year old son."
3,Not worth buying 3D version,The movie itself was a good movie which we enjoyed. However we paid the extra money to buy the 3D version as we just purchased a new 3D tv. It was definitely not worth the extra money. There was very little content in the movie that brought out the benefit of 3D. Several times I checked my glasses to make sure they were still on as it would look like 2D content for long periods of time. Would not recommend buying this movie in 3D.
5,"Wonderful, inspirational movie.",I bought this movie after I had watched it and loved it. I wanted my mother and good friends to see it. It's special that Winter is a real dolphin.
5,A true 'feel-good' tale... well done.,"My granddaughters liked it so much they watched it twice. I watched both times with them and shed a tear or two each time. The boy's kinship with the dolphin was genuine and heart wrenching and his perseverance, first to replace the dolphin's damaged tail, then later, to save the hospital/aquarium, had wonderful consequences."
4,family movie,This was a good family movie a little slow at first. However the price was good and the shipment fast. The quality of the tape was excellent.
5,Dolphin Tale,I really enjoyed watching this movie with my 5 and 6 year old daughters. My 6 year old instigated watching it and I am so glad that she did. It was such a great family movie!
2,GREAT MOVIE. Unhappy with Ultraviolet digital copy.,"I purchased this movie which came with a digital copy, I always choose to buy the version that comes with digital copy so I don't have to worry about my kids scratching the disc and can put it on the family iPods/Apple TV. The movie is great my family loves it! I would give the movie a good 5 stars and the digital copy portion a 0 since it's useless for the purpose we purchased this item. The digital copy doesn't work with iTunes which stinks that I can't put it on the iPods. Anyway, I wish I would have purchased this item from the iTunes store, I learned I have to stay away from any kind of digital copy that says Ultraviolet."
4,"Good, Solid Kids Movie","My wife caught the movie on a flight and, a fan of movies she can just switch off and feel good to - exactly what kids movies should be - she loved Dolphin Tale.I've tried watching it, myself. It does nothing for me. It's not bad, just nothing stimulating for those who look for great movies. But then that's not what you need in a kids movie. Well, OK, you can really benefit (Shrek or the original Muppet Movie, just like Animaniacs, are elevated to a whole other level by having one level for kids and a lot of subtle jokes for the parents) but it's not essential if it's just something to put on for the kids."
4,Touching,This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.It's a great family movie and it's even better because it's based on a true story.I liked all the actors in this movie including Harry Connick's Jr.'s character.I thought he was great in this.I'm glad they didn't have the boy's mom and the girl's dad have a romantic realationship as they usually do in these type of movies.I thought for sure that's what was gonna happen.Maybe they wanted to make the movie as close as to the real story as possible.I'm glad that the dolphin had a happy ending and that there are so many people that care about animals as much as they people did.If you love animal movies or dolphins and you want a movie that you can watch with the whole family and leave you feeling good at the end then I highly recomend this movie.
5,Very Good Movie,My granddaughters are 6 & 4 & they enjoyed watching this movie with me. Makes me want to travel to Florida to see the real dolphin. It kept our interest the whole time!!! Enjoyable!!
1,Ultraviolet sucks!,"I won't buy this until Warner Brothers adds the iTunes Digital Copy back. Good movie, crappy Flixster App and limitations of Ultraviolet. I can't stream it to my Apple TV, or easily sync it with my iPhone or iPad. Pure crap."
2,"The movie bit ""flat"" real story is amazing","Our family LOVES movies about rescuing animals or when the animal is the hero. However, this movie let a lot to be desired. It was really predictable and then seemed to drag on and on to the point of bordome. Does not measure up to Flipper, Free Willy, Zeus and roxanne, I can go on. Also, I am not going to give the movie away but if you are going to take GOD out of a movie as so many movies do today, why have someone ""pray"" to someone that passed away to ask for their help instead of our All Mighty God???????"
1,Is this a joke?,Is this some kind of a joke? Give me a pack full of GREAT films that will really rock my collection with great cinematography and great sound and I'll gladly jump on it.But this Hallmark collection of TV movies is an offensive offer. Are we supposed to buy this collection just because of the price of each disc? Since when is starting a collection a reason in itself to buy just any disc?Is this the way to kick this new great format? TV movies with nothing of exceptional to offer?
1,Don't waste your money,"These movies appear to be copies, they are definitely not from the original Manufacturer since they are not factory sealed and have no UPC code but instead state that they are not for Individual resale which means if you ever want to sell them you can't unless you sale them as a 20 piece set and use the UPC code provided for that."
1,wow,this is the stupidest thing i have ever seen. i'd buy a richard simmons video before i bought this.......
1,Joke.,Clicked the link to see what movies were in here. Complete joke! Has anyone even seen more that 5 of these movies?
1,Made me laugh,I couldn't pick more losers if I tried. Suggested price to move thisinventory out= $12.99
1,Some of the worst i've never heard of!,"Why suffer through these horrible movies in standard definition when you can see how truly horrific they are in high def. If this value pack were a joke it would be pretty funny. The fact that its for real makes it twice as funny! And for anybody that doesn't know; Artie Lange's Beer League is a very funny movie! It is the only keeper in the bunch. Hell, its the only one of the bunch I've even heard of. I doubt it really benefits from being on blu ray so pick it up cheap on dvd or rent it."
1,This HAS to be a Joke....right?,Shannnon Doherty? Luke Perry? haha IS this the Beverly Hills 90210 has been blue ray edition? I cannot believe someone actually packaged this junk and attempted to sell it...Lifetime wouldn't even play these movies...this is sad but funny.
1,LOL,"Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!Sorry, I'm wondering how dumb whoever put this set out thinks we are. Let's put Robin Williams real big across the front and everyone will buy it no questions asked!!!! No ... just no."
1,These tiles are not were the money - never heard of them,I'll keep it brief. The titles that come with this package are titles I haven't any heard of. Most of these as others have said are films made for TV and are not Hollywood films. I would have your money and skipped this one unless you want to buy another trash can.
1,BlahCube,"Worst movies of the worst genre: Made for TV disaster movies. Perhaps the highlight of this motley collection is the biggest disaster of all: Kim Delaney on BloatLoad. Man, she could miss a meal."
3,Good Value for the Money,"Being 50+ years old. I enjoy the titles included in this package, especially for the money. I am sure the younger crowd will not appreciate any of them (can't please everyone all the time). Again, good value for the money."
1,"""Blu-crap"" would make good kitchen stool",I probably would buy this if there were a worldwide shortage on kitchen stools and I needed something to stand on to help me reach the cabinets above my fridge that are hard to get at.
1,Are You Kidding????!!,"I clicked on this hoping it would bring up some great titles and this is what I get??? Horrible, I agree with all the other reviews on this page."
1,Wow Look How many I Have !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I know, I know. I got all excited when I first saw this bundle myself. But after further review, I guess this bundle is for the person who likes to say ""Hey, Look how many Blu-rays I have""!These movies are a poor version of audio/video quality for blu-ray. Kind of like dubbing your 8-tracks tapes onto CD. Yes they will play in a CD player but, they will sound like poop.And let's face it, the movie selection is ... well ... you know.Have you heard of any of these movies? No. And you know why, RIGHT?!Pure poop, That's why!!"
1,I wouldn't even buy this for someone I hate,To give this as a gift would be really cruel. And I wouldn't even buy it for someone I really hated as a gift. Pathetic to say the least.
1,Wow. How sad.,"Maybe these movies are all actually amazing, but I'm willing to bet there's a reason that I've never heard of them. I don't think I've ever seen such an assemblage of digital garbage in all my life. I want to see the moron who actually spent $300 on this package. I love the Blu-Ray format, but if anyone I knew saw these movies in my collection, I would never hear the end of it."
5,Good History!,"This was a well balanced DVD. Mixed with history of every monument, and some modern day video. I am pleased with my purchase."
1,Not quite,"I like the music of Charlotte Church and Enya, as another reviewer commented. I fail to find a comparison between those artists and Cecilia. She lacks range, and I find her intonations rather monotonous. Save your money and go for Charlotte Church."
5,Handbuilt Pottery Techniques,Excellent. I'm looking forward to using this book as a guide for my own pottery handbuilding. A good book to get started with this craft.
3,Not what I expected... I was looking for 'dinnerware',"I purchased this book for 'dinnerware' ideas. But there were few of these items that are featured in this book. There are alot of 'artsy' or sculpture-like ceramics that are featured. If you want to know about handbuilding and working with molds, this is a great book for you.Overall, I'd have to say that this book has alot of great information, great instructions, and pictures. But the information is not what I was looking for. I will keep it incase my interest changes to work more with the featured type of ceramics."
5,Outstanding,I bought this while taking a class on hand building. This was an excellent supplement and would recommend it to anyone learning hand building pottery. It has lots of great projects with step by step instructions.
5,"No wheel, no kiln? No problem!","If you're a frustrated potter, with no wheel, no kiln, no tools and no room...lift yourself out of your depression. All you need is a few pounds of polymer air-drying clay, a sink, and a table. Anything else you might need (a rolling pin to flatten the clay) you will probably find around the house. But before all that, you need to get this book! It is the clearest exposition of any artistic process I have ever read, and loaded with tons of crystal clear photographs. You will learn how to make pots, (large and small) bowls, garden sclpture, baskets, boxes with lids and much more. You also get all the decorating techniques as well.Although the book was produced in England and deals with firing clay, the same procedures can be used with polymer air-drying clay. Polymer clay comes in several colors and can be fired as well (check the label). So, what are you waiting for? Now is the time to fulfill your lifelong dream. You too will be able to say: I can do that!"
5,great ideas!,"I love this book! A co-worker/co-potter friend had this book and after glancing through it I knew I had to have it. Many ideas for projects, detailed explanations, simple and fun to make projects. Great for teachers or if you just need some inspiration."
5,Great Reference,I really like this book. Full of photos and great ideas. Also great on tecnical aspects of building pottery.
5,Entirely Memorable!,"Paul Simon's songs are all special and memorable and are beautifully performed in this video. I saw this performance first on TV and was so happy when it finally was offered on DVD! Mark Anthony just about brings down the house with his performance; Simon and Garfunkel singing the classic ""Bridge over troubled waters"" brings back so many memories. The African singers, Lyle Lovett, etc. all were exceptional. This is a must get AND must play often!!"
2,Paul Simon and Freinds,"I saw this once before and Net Flix and I enjoyed the show. Allison was great when she sang ""The Boxer"" shortly after that the show droped from Net Flix, I found it on Amazon! Great, however when I played the program the audio was terrible, I had to shut it off, that bad, tried another show on Amazon, just fine. I know it was not my system, that works just fine. If you can find this show any where else, watch it. Worth while"
3,Watched it,It was just Okay. Love the songs but would've like to hear from Paul Simon more than the other performers
4,review of Paul Simon and friends,See my Video review on You Tub. Put MrWm2800 in the You tub Search box and you will bring up this as well as several other concert reviews
1,Better Paul Simon elsewhere,I found this tribute to the music of Paul Simon severely lacking in satisfying my love of his music. Most of the music is done without Simon and there is something missing. It is sort of like having George Bush juniors portrait on the dollar bill instead of Washington. It may spend the same but it isnt. Even with Simon it really isnt that good. If you want spectacular Paul Simon get the 25th anniversary concert for the rock and roll hall of fame held in 2010 at madison square garden. Save your money on this poor example and get the other concert. You will be alot happier with the result. Even Garfunkles performance was light years better at the rock and roll hall of fame concert than here. I can watch Simon again and again with the hall of fame concert and it is always great. This dvd is a watch once and throw it out. Nuff said
2,Friends and Paul Simon,"This is not worth the money you pay ... It is not a Paul Simon in concert disc . Out of the 25 songs or so in the Blu ray disc , hardly 7 or 8 features Paul Simon . Some of Paul Simon's ""friends"" are no way near the maestro when it comes to singing his tunes. I would give this disc a 2 / 5 rating"
2,Paul Simon only in the end...,"Could be better! No Paul Simon till the end of the concert. But, it get worse, the piano version of The Sounds of Silence... TERRIBLE!!!"
1,Won't play in PowerDVD,"I just got the disk today. Unfortunately, when I play it on my computer (using legally bought Cyberlink PowerDVD), the FBI warning stays over the middle of the screen even after the program starts. I just paid for a disk that I cannot play because someone thought it necessary to tell me not to steal the disk! How frustrating.Fortunately, I bought the DVD at the same time and I am watching that right now. Had I not done so, this would be the moment I would go online to ""illegally"" download the show. Thank you very much FBI/MPAA/RIAA and associates. :-("
2,"A Disapointement, really","Could've been a great concert if only better friends had been on hand.James Taylor is the worse of the bunch: I didn't know SLIP SLIDIN' AWAY was a FUNNY SONG until I watched him perform it here! Man, was he constipated or what? Only the great Steve Gadd on drums plus Stevie Wonder and the quite numerous background musicians save the day.There are good moments indeed, like Art Garfunkel's heartfelt finale on Bridge Over Troubled Waters (only due here). So buy this thing if you're a completist. Otherwise, let it pass."
3,"Nice, could be better...","Honestly, we got this because of one song on the album. She has a great voice and a ""Best of..."" is as far as our collection of her CD's go.You should get it if you like strong vocals but it does not seem to be a good overall selection for a ""Very Best of"" album to me."
4,Very fun and very fast.,"The Geography Club is a fun book. Very fast pased. Russel is an interesting carector, but I was just wondering where the parents were through all this. He never had a conversation with any of his parents, or adults for that matter, except the coach, and it was very brief. But besides that, I enjoyed the story. Can't wait to read the sequel."
3,Decent but not rich!,"This novel is quite well written .. it flows and the characters are real -but they all lacked enough depth. I wanted more from this book - I wanted more real feeling and more real emotion. I kind of felt like I was reading a police report - just the facts and nothing more.It's a simple little book that is easily read in 1 or 2 sittings. Although not perfect, this book is worth reading and can be enjoyable enough. Not a stand out novel but not something to forget about either."
5,Amazing,"After just having finished reading Geography Club, with still that bitter sweet feeling that you get accompanying a happy/sad ending, I write this review. To put it simply, I loved this book. It was my first from this author and I am pleased to have stumbled across it. This book will make it into the select few I strongly reccomend and will read over and over again.Well done Brent Hartinger for writing such an excellent book."
3,Geo club review,I bought this book because someone recommended it to me. I thought it was okay. just okay. At tmes it was a little too cheesy teen angst for me. It was mildly entertaining. decent quick 3 hour read. Prepare to be disapointed though.
5,one of the best books ever,"I couldn't put it down. The truth, fantasy, and romance make for an exquisite read."
5,Amazing Book,This book captures all the feelings and emotions and fears that go with growing up gay in a high school setting - brilliantly depicted and wonderfully written - a definite page turner. It's hard to put this book down once you start. Highly recommended!
5,Geography Club blazes a new trail,"A theme of discovery runs through Brent Hartinger's Geography Club, just like explorers discovering a new land. So the book and the club that five high school students start at their high school is appropriately named, too. And even though the Geography Club doesn't have anything to do with geography, since the gay and lesbian students who started it didn't want others to join, it has everything to do with a kind of map to understanding what it's like to be a gay kid in a typical high school, or an outcast. Hartinger brilliantly captures the voice of his teen age protagonist and story teller. He also captures the heart and mind of the reader. You don't have to be gay to learn something from this book; what that is, I will leave to each reader. I think it has a lot to do with who you are and the geography of your own mind. --Ronald L. Donaghe..."
3,Disappointing,"An ok book but a disappointing read. Very teenage in the tone. usually books for teenagers can also be read by adults, but I don't recommend this one for adults."
4,interesting,Middle - end got my interest...its sad at the end in my view...It is pretty good.you may think this leads to sex or what not.. but doesn't it's a short romance and friend ship..
5,"Awsome Book, must read for all gay and straight teens","This book was great. The idea oh having a gay club and putting a front up of it being a geography club so no one wants to join it, is a very cool idea for a very close-minded place. This is a must read for all gay and straight teens alike. Everyone can put themselves in the spot of these teens during high school."
4,Good Teen Fiction,"Russel is in high school, and secretly gay. He keeps it a secret because he's sure no one else is gay. But, after discovering a gay classmate in a chat room, the two band together with other gay classmates in a group called The Geography Club, purposefully named so that no other students will want to join because they figure Geography is as boring as it gets. This paradise for the closeted gay students quickly bonds the students, as they open up and learn more about each other and themselves. Soon, though, this halfway point between ""in"" an ""out"" becomes a problem, and problems crop up in these new friendships. This book is a well-written example of YA literature with a gay protagonist. Russel is likeable and funny, and I like that he shows how easy it is to be both masculine and gay. I think this would be a great book both for gay teens, and for teens that come from homophobic backgrounds, to show them how easy it is to relate to a gay teen."
5,Geography Club by Brent Hartinger,"This should be a MUST in high school -- for ALL teachers and English classes -- WITH discussion groups after the book has been read. Keep it up Brent. Not a preachy book -- but a book about feelings, not just [alternative lifestyle] teens, but all teens who are pointed at, joked about, isolated by others. ... Every library at least MUST HAVE one copy -- public and school libraries."
5,Absolutely Amazing!,"This book is truly one of the best books that I've ever read.With that said, I'll say that the book seems geared towards young adults but I'm 25 and I can still relate to the book. This book actually brought forth a lot of emotion within me - especially since I've dealt with many of the issues that this book deals with. There were points throughout the book where I found myself actually holding my breath and reliving part of past experiences because all of it was so real. Brent is an amazing author with a mastery of words and a rare talent for imagery. I absolutely respect him for what he has done with this moving story that truly is a part of all of us whether we're gay, straight or otherwise."
1,NOT THE ORIGINAL STORY BY R.D. BLACKMORE!,"This book is not the original story by R. D. Blackmore. Instead it is a very abridged children's version of only 175 pages of large type and pictures. It is designed very deceptively with R.D. Blackmore on the cover, but inside it says ""A new version of the favorite classic by Archie Oliver""."
1,Don't Bother Buying This Book,"This book is so limited it's not even worth the amount Amazon.Com asks for...save your money for a better book like ""A Practical Guide To The Runes"" by Lisa Peschel."
1,Not well researched.,"The first sentence in the book shows how poorly researched this is.""Runes are an ancient alphabet that was used by pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon, Germanic, and Norse peoples over three thousand years ago...""(Runes did not exist until about 2000 years ago & Anglo-Saxons were not around until half a milennium after that)Further in, it does not get any better. You could waste your money on inaccurate New-Age twaddle, or find a factual bargain like this:Rudiments of Runelore"
5,Only if you like comedy,This movie is so bad its funny. I like these low budget movies with a good line. I purchased this movie for the artwork and found it to be entertaining enough for five stars. Don't hateme if it is not what you expected. At least its funny.
3,it's ok,this movie is ok i seen better i seen worst only spent 1.99 to watch it and thats what it is worth to me...i do agree with the other's this movie is a rip off from jaws but on the other hand can u really compare the two?
2,poor,"I love shark movies, but this one is not one of the best. I did not like it at all. I wasted my money on it. Not worth buying in my oppinion. Two headed Shark attack is better."
3,About this product...,"As noted above, this is a burned-on-demand DVD-R, not a mastered DVD.The image quality is actually amazing. Sharp, clean, excellent color, letterboxed. The audio is another story. A lot of the dialogue is at low volume and is hard to understand, and drowned out further by the much louder music and sound effects. A disappointment, especially considering the surprising video quality, but the film is still watchable (listenable?)There are 9 chapter stops, but no menu (the movie just starts playing when you pop in the disc), no subtitles (a shame, considering the audio issue), no extras."
3,The Last Shark,"Hahahahahaha......well it IS a shark movie....I was disappointed with some of the acting. And the music was very, very bad....it didnt set the mood for the danger a shark truly brings forth."
5,Great Price!,My dad used to have this record. I cant believe it was so cheap. You can find anything on Amazon!
4,A Great Album for any Blues Brothers Fan,"""Briefcase Full of Blues"" is full of great songs such as ""Soul Man"" and my favorite, ""Rubber Biscuit."" I always enjoy listening to the Blues Brothers' music, especially this album. The only song I didn't like so much was ""Shot Gun Blues"" because it sounded really depressing (which was different from the usual up-beat music that they usually played). Because of that, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. If you're a fan of the Blues Brothers, I still recommend buying it."
5,Love this album!,"I love these guys not only are they funny, which we all know, but they can really play the blues!!"
5,R & B Classic,This is a must-have for any R&B collection. Some great onstage moments from a few truely talented rythm and blues artists.
4,Blues Brothers Soundtrack,"Good, but does not include some songs that I would have liked to have on the soundtrack. Tracks are not arranged in the order in which they appear in the movie."
3,briefcase full of blues,"amazon send me 2 of this one but no-one of ""the blues brothers complete"". there was a mistake. haow can you fix it? my best regards waiting for your prompt response"
1,"Not worth a penny, even though it cost a little more.","2 songs out of 12 isn't good. This isn't even worth the cheapo price. I really liked the movie and the soundtrack. The only thing I like about the CD are the songs: Rubber Biscuit, Soul Man, and the photo of Dan Ackroyd. Digitally remastered doesn't matter if the songs aren't any good to start with. This doesn't add anything to the soundtrack, so save your money."
1,Worthless,"Great R&B songs reduced to mindless frat boy hedonism. The SNL skit was amusing at times, but recording albums was an insult to a vital American tradtion and art form. Shame."
4,It never was and still isnt a joke,"I think these guys really did love the blues and they have some talent. They assembled a good band and the performances are worth listening to again and again. The songs they chose are mostly humorous, so listening to these blues will not drive you to drink or something worse. When I first saw them debut this Blues Brothers act on SNL in the 70s, I thought it was a joke. Especially because i recall Dan doing the Rubber Biscuit song, which is humorous. Soul Man was the only cut that got (maybe ever got) any radio airtime, but it's probably my least favorite song on the album. I had the 8 track of this, and before I finally bought the CD, it had been maybe 27 years since i had listening to the whole album. Still as good after all these years!"
5,Wonderful,"Product came much quicker than I thought it would. Definitely worth the purchase. Perfectly as described in the item information. Quite the set of tunes, as well~"
5,Fun!,Great fun listening to Briefcase Full of Blues! What a great sound from a once in a lifetime ensemble! Duck Gunn's recent passing made me think of the Blues Brothers and their energy! Thanks!
4,NO WINGS IN THE AIR,"This is a great idea for people like me. There are no technical details, and a very good explanation on how a helicopter works. It is a great idea to learn how the helicopter flies and see it in action. I would like this video must have contained more natural sounds included, very specially the scene where a crew is ready to board and start the engine. I consider this video a good form of entertainment for both adults and children. The contents are nice and enjoyable. If you enjoy aircrafts this video is ideal for you."
4,'Fasco,exactly what i needed to repair the fan in my bathroom and easy to install. would puchase this product again
4,Venice as it was - and very little has changed,Very old book which I needed for a study of his paintings so it was perfect in content with no missing bookplates. The pictures (paintings by author) are wonderful. Really caught the spirit and atmosphere of Venice at the time
1,Roger the whole damn band!,"Really just a terrible disappointment for me. I love psychedelia, I love hard rock, and I should have loved this, right? Unfortunately, almost all of the songs have extremely weak melodies, and the trippy sentiments, poorly thought out to begin with, have aged very badly, reminding me of something that Neil from ""The Young Ones"" might sing. The singing is probably the worst I've ever heard from any ""major"" band - its terribly whiny, nasal and thin. Its clear that the band thought that the instrumentation was far more important than the singing, but the singing is so bad I can't even listen to the instruments. And it didn't even deliver the all guitar chops I was expecting. If melody, tightly constructed songs, or good singing is important to you in your '60's blues-rock, there's nothing here for you. Check out ""My Friend Jack"" by The Smoke, the Who's first album, the Stones' ""Aftermath,"" ""Nuggets,"" or Jimi Hendrix."
5,No need for endless irritating repetitions...so buy this version.,"The Yardbirds/ Roger the Engineer (Warner Archives - 14 tracks): This is the CD version that gives you 12 tracks in stereo and the last tracks two in mono. This CD does not repeat songs, does not analyze the difference between mono and stereo of the same song and, in short, does not irritate me. This is a great Yardbirds album and this CD gives it to you without running it into the ground."
5,A Composite Classic!,"This 1966 LP was originally titled ""Over Under Sideways Down"" in the USA. It's an excellent album! Jeff Beck is playing up a storm here! The classic tracks ""Psycho Daisies"", ""Jeff's Boogie"", ""Lost Woman"", ""What Do You Want"", ""Happenings Ten Years Time Ago"", and the title track make this a milestone album in rock! The mono version of this LP originally had tracks that the stereo version didn't, and vice-versa, but all tracks are combined into one album for the CD release! Don't pass this one up... it's a must!!"
5,A GREAT record!,"The Yardbirds were a fantastic band during all phases of their career. They are noted for having arguably the three greatest rock guitarist (Clapton, Beck, & Page) pass through their ranks and while this produced some great music, it also caused problems. Their first albums featured a Clapton and the blues vs. Beck and his experimentations dicotomy. Their last record featured the transition from Beck to Page and hard rock. This record is all Jeff and his fantastic, experimental guitar style. Every song on this record has his stamp on it, even ""Happenings Ten Years Time Ago"" which has Page playing a second lead. ""Lost Woman"", ""Over, Under, Sideways, Down"", ""Jeff's Boogie"", etc. are all terrific. This recording is always with me on road trips and just listening to what Beck can do on the guitar helps make the trip easier. I love Clapton and his blues and I love Page and his hard rock but in my opinion, Jeff Beck is the best rock guitarist of them all. No one has challenged him yet."
4,Classical reference for thermodynamics,As other reviewers of Gibbs have said this work is the origin of physical chemistry. It is challenging to read his material but worth the effort to see how thermodynamics developed.
1,Warning Notice,"For 7 bucks you can't expect a high quality product even if it's Stanley branded. This square DOESN'T have metric scale!!! Only English scale, so I wasted my money. This fact isn't mentioned in the product title nor in the description. They mention ""Available in English, English/Metric and Metric"" but the title just says ""Stanley 46-222 Combination Square"" with no reference of which scale this square is. Better, I will buy a Starrett square from my local store, which is much better than Stanley and they don't cheat customers."
5,Low Standards,"Interesting and to me an obscure group and make note the title is not reflective in any way the quality of music or level of the musicians. Quite the contrary, there are great players on this and fine musical exchanges between all the the band members, sound quality and choice of tunes nicely laid out and killer vocals. I play it frequently and as hobbyist jazz drummer wannabe enjoy playing along to this one with headphones. Great background for a late afternoon cocktails!RegardsDon"
4,Suunto Mosquito,"This dive computer might not have more functions than the others on the market but it has something that none of the others have, user replaceable batteries!!! and its smaller than the other ones!"
4,Sorry Martin,"I hate argue with my compatriot but I think this is great CD from start to finish with the possible exception of Babyface, III Wishes is a good introduction to the album, Hypnotised will have you shouting along with the chorus ( I've got it playing while I type this review), the 2 versions of their UK number 2 Tequila will stick in your head for hours after you stop listening. This is the first Terrorvision CD I have listened to so I can't compare it to their earlier material but I have been playing it whenever I can for the last 2 weeks. I would say this is Englands answer to The Offspring (another great band to listen to loud)."
1,No Braclet in box!,"I received the box timely, but the problem was it was empty, I have not found a way to let anyone know that I was ripped off!!! This was for my daughters Christmas and we were both really disappointed...I want a refund!!"
2,Cute but not what I expected.,"The info says that you can use Blue's paw as a stamp, to put paw prints (that wash off easily)on the bathtub walls. We got soap ink and attempted this and it does not work at all. Blue is cute and fast drying, but his paws don't stamp at all."
5,Incredibly durable,We bought this when our son was hating bathtime to lure him into the tub. That was over two years ago and Blue hasn't missed a bath since then. We use her to demonstrate hair washing and let him have fun getting the water in her eyes so she can bark at him (enormous giggles). He loves her still at 3 years old and even brings her to the pool and an occasional beach trip. We love that she's wearing a life vest so we can get him to wear his too!
2,career filler,"This Jansch album comes from his ""depressed period"" of the 1980s. That pretty much sums it up, unfortunately. Both the material and the performance is very lacklustre, and I would recommend *any* other Jansch album over this one. Why has this album been made available on cd when much better ones--e.g. ""L. A. Turnaround,"" ""Avocet,"" and ""A Rare Conundrum""--haven't? The world is just one big puzzle..."
2,A llitle bit interesting... Nothing else...,"Wilson Phillips was a short-living female vocal trio: Chynna Phillips plus sisters Carnie and Wendy Wilson.These gals are very good singers, have fantastic voices... Then I suspect they hadn't a good promotional support, &/or a very good manager.All allong their musical career they had two or three major hits only, included in this album.In addition, there's a nonsense track titled 'A conversation with Wilson Phillips' (not interesting at all), but definitely there are two other tracks worth more than a try... These are the covers of Elton John's classic Hit 'Daniel', the other one is a live in Japan performance of Eagles' megahit 'Hotel California'.If you really, really love to hear music and add new funny things to your music collection, maybe this CD will make you happy."
5,My first Wilson Phillips CD! I am hooked! Woo!,"After all the ... from britney spears and christina, I found a Cd worth talking about and listening to. On the very first day I bought it, I told myself it was ..., but when I opened it, put it in my cd walkman, I was like Oh, my God! This is the most beautiful music I ever heard! I listened from start to finish! What I think: This was the best music since I heard Celine Dion's That's the way it is. My favorite song from this was Hold on and The dream is still alive. I bearley even knew this, but the girls put their solos on this thing too. I love Chynna's naked and sacred. It's beautiful. None like Justin Timberlake's stupid ... solos."
3,Just OK,These foreign knock-offs prove disappointing. Never know what songs you're gonna get. Cover is from the issued cassette but isn't what i thought I was getting. Amazon should always publish what the tracks are. Started using a used record store where at least I can see what I'm getting.
4,Bought this because of bridesmaids,"I bought this for my wife as a gag gift for her birthday because we saw Wilson Philips in the movie bridesmaids. Not a bad CD, remember 3 or 4 of their songs from the 90's on the radio."
4,But they only did TWO ALBUMS!!!!!,"....But they only made TWO ALBUMS!!!!! However this album makes up for the period when they didn't have no newer music out. Liked the liner notes inside. The music and song lineup is very well done. I've noticed a trend of these kinds of albums lately when artists made two albums for a label. Wait a while before you put out one for them. Hopefully, their new album will get them back out there big time--it's good to hear that they're back!!!!"
3,Greatest Hits Plus Some Misses,"I love Wilson Phillips and thought this would be a great CD to buy. I liked it well enough but it had some pretty terrible songs in with all their great ones. For example, their version of ""Hotel California"" was awful. I did like their cover of ""Daniel"" a lot however. I would stick with ""The Best of Wilson Phillips"" instead because it has all the real greatest hits without the obscure songs that are on the end of this one."
4,Great choice!,"This book covers everything you need for the 2 related exams. It's very thorough, and explains things well."
5,a must have for the new low salt dieter,This book is great because it has a wonderful variety of low sodium dishes that are easy to prepare and taste great. After I was recently diagnosed with Meneire's disease I had no where to turn to for low sodium dishes. This book has given me the courage to explore this new lifestyle - and enjoy it!
5,Delicious food,"Just got this book a week ago and have made three recipes, all were delicious. My family did not have to add salt, because the recipes had flavor thru spices. For someone who needs low salt this is a great book."
5,Cooking without a grain of salt,I have found this book to be very helpful. I am glad that someone has compiled the information and submitted it in book form. Very good!
4,Same complaint I have with most cookbooks.,"This book is wonderful for cooking with low or no sodium. I bought this because my parents needed to decrease their sodium and potassium. This book does list the potassium count in the nutrition breakdown which helps me. I highly recommend it for people looking for healthier recipes.I keep wondering why nearly all of the cookbooks have to be in book form. Use spiral bindings, please. Make them easy to use!"
3,Great but book code was missing,"Book was great but the book did not include the code it was suppose to have in the front of the book, so when you went to the web site to do certain assignements; the code was not given like it was suppose to so I had to pay additional $10.00 dollars to get to the assignement. Once you pay the ten dollars, the web site is not friendly and still could not find some of the assignments that were suppose to be on the web site with this book. The book is the only thing that is readable and friendly."
1,Careful about what you buy.,I bought this brand new and it would be a good book if it wasn't poorly manufactured. In the book it skips chapters 4 and half of chapter 5 and makes up for the lost chapters by repeating chapter 3 twice. Sure it's good for getting by in class but it'd be nice to know what chapter 4 and the first half of 5 is all about.
1,Poor Quality,The quality of printing in this edition is extremely poor. The drawings are illegible. Looks like it came out of a fax machine. The textual content of the book consists almost entirely of arithmetical computations that even a professional engineer would have a hard time following. I returned this book as defective.
1,Same of stuff - blah,"You've heard this all before, 500 times. I think this book was written after they read other books on the same. Don't be fooled, this really doesn't work, as a matter of fact this is the type of mindless nonesense that actually holds up the work flow of companies."
5,A New Age Splatpunk Western not to miss,"Recovering from addiction is not about peace. It is about war. It is about calling out obsessions and saying ""it's either you or me"". Siren Promised is about this showdown, about what it takes and what it takes out of a person. The book's protagonists are slaves to their obsessions and desires, deprived of the things it takes for them to be healthy, decent human beings. No excuses or apologies are made for these people and yet you cannot help but love and pity them as they prepare for the confrontations that will change their lives forever. A junkie and a pedophile are revealed as human, lonely and beautiful in their repugnance. Illustrations by Alan M. Clark complement Johnson's style perfectly and make this book into a must read. It's like if Cormac Mc Carthy wrote Diary of a Drug Fiend. With Siren Promised, Jeremy Johnson called addiction out into the street and fired a blazing pistol of a novel at it. I cannot recommend this enough."
2,Amazon's description is off,Don't get me wrong--this is a wonderful book! Shedd is a preeminent author on dogmatic theology. So this review is just for Amazon's representation of the book.I bought this for my graduate Essential Doctrine class at BIOLA. The syllabus called for the 3rd edition of Shedd's work.This is NOT the 3rd edition of the work. This is a copied facsimile of the Supplement for Volume 3 of the 1894 work. NOT Shedd's entire work.So be careful! Make sure you buy the correct copy for school work! Hint--use this link:http://www.amazon.com/Dogmatic-Theology-William-Greenough-Thaye/dp/0875521886/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid;=1359506871&sr;=8-3Hope that helps!
4,I was dissapointed with the quality of the book...,"I ordered this book because a friend of mine recommended it.I waited with anticipation for its arrival.When I finally received it and opened up the box I was saddened.This is one of the cheapest books that I have ever held in my hands.The quality of the book is second hand. The pages were falling of as I skimmed through it. The font is an ugly type, about size 10, so it is not a pleasant read. Also, some of the pages were blank. I tried to get a refund or an exchange, but I was told that all of their copies were in that condition. Also, the introduction made me fall asleep. It is so monotonous and illogical."
3,Not as described in the advert ...,"...at least in terms of the color. True to the ad, this is a small, magnetic, travel backgammon board. Functionality is good although the zipper is pretty lightweight. However, the case IS NOT brown leather/vinyl as appears in the amazon.com advert. The case is basically a minty green ""lizard"" fabric; only its edges are wrapped in brown vinyl. Similarly, the inside playing surface is mint green not off-white as appears in the advert, and the dice cups are also the green lizard skin fabric, not brown as appear in the photo. I think it looks tacky, but my wife likes it so I guess we're keeping it."
1,Not What I Expected,"I choose this product for it's design. The burgundy coloring and lizard looking appearance. I searched long and hard for a small attractive set. Excited to find this one in particular, I purchased it. To my extreme disappointment the product I received did not match the product's image as shown. It was Pewter lizard top and bottom with burgundy vinyl along the seams and pewter lizard dice cups. Not cute at all! (personal opinion)Customer Service was great. They sent a replacement immediately, thinking an error in style selection had been made. I was let down a second time. My end result was having to return both sets."
3,Unfortunately not winning friends and influencing people,"Though the subject matter is near and dear to my heart and the topics were well conceived, Paulos was often distractingly abrasive in his recommended ""solutions"" to the problems of innumeracy. I can't help but feel that he spends too little time with non-mathematicians; the lack of perspective from which dilutes his well intentioned message. One's time is better spent reading Martin Gardner or Carl Sagan."
3,Needs a bit of direction,"This book is very good, but it seems that he could have done a better job by giving specific examples that were found in real life. On one hand, the topic of debunking is something done-to-death. On the other, it is nice when you read a book about something that disproves something that you've always thought wrong and you can say ""Oh! That's why that is so!"" This book does not go in that direction. Thematic organization would have been immensely useful to an otherwise very good idea.Also, some of the topics that he brought up were not supported by numbers. Like his mentioning that math education majors were the worst in all of his math classes. How *much* worse were they? Was their score 2% below the average or 20% below?On the good side, it was a short book. There was not much wasted space in the sense that he didn't simultaneously write and assert *nothing* (as anyone who's ever read an Ayn Rand book knows is possible)."
5,Not an error!,"In response to a previous reader's ""glaring error,"" I note that there is a condition in Paulos's statement of the ""two children problem"" which makes Paulos's answer of 2/3 correct. The problem is a well-known one and very sensitive to phrasing."
5,"a real classic, yet fun","After four years of college, I'm packing up and heading into the real world. One of the few books I'm keeping is Innumeracy. It was required reading when I was a freshman and again when I was a senior and I loved it even more the second time around. Few books lead you to an entirely new way of looking at the world and I, for one, would never think a math book would do that. It provided me with a more healthy way to think about chance, science, and even politics. A real classic that is fun to read. Paulos' wit makes the ride enjoyable all the way through."
4,Interesting applications,"Delighted by the latest Paulos' book (a mathematician plays the stock market) I was really interested in reading more of his books. This one is a non-technical introduction to the main concepts of probability and statistics. While the concepts themselves are not new for many people, the applications of these concepts are very interesting and entertaining. Paulos provides from a deconstruction of pseudoscience, to an optimal algorithm for finding your spouse..."
3,Good ... but starting to show its age,"I have read several ""mathematics for a popular audience"" books as a high school math teacher who has done graduate work in mathematics. This is considered a classic, but I felt like it was no longer up to date at times. Also, I had the feeling I had read many of the better examples and such in other places - again this book is now a classic. It is good, but I have read similar books that I enjoyed more."
3,This book is good but overrated,"Paulos became a hero with this book, but the book is overrated. A couple of the examples are just plain wrong. If you like Allan Bloom, you'll like John Allen Paulos, but I think both of them are a bit whiny.Henry Troup"
4,Some interesting info,"Not quite as good as I expected, but some good material. He does point up some good illustrations of not understanding what numbers mean. Some v ery good info on coincidence, happenstance, chances of things happening, etc.Worth the read."
3,A Sem-Decent Read,"In my math class at school, we read this book as an addition to our yearly curriculum. Had it not been for the class, I wouldn't have been bothered picking up this book. My feelings on this are rather mixed. Though the book was interesting to read, I felt that at times Paulos seemed to overstep his boundaries with explaining events and how they're not mathematically correct and in the process, seemed to boost his own ego. As previously mentioned before, the book was interesting and had many tidbits in it that made me raise my brow, but other than that the book isn't something I would recommend to others nor would I ever read it again."
1,a review from an iliterateon innumeracy,"paulos is full of himself. after a couple of pages, i got tired of reading his jibberish which amounted to nothing more than him showing off his vocabulary. i found the book choppy and hard to follow. regret buying the book, at least it was paperback and cheap. stay away.... dont buy the book."
3,Are you innumerate?,"This book was a pretty quick read, and while it covered a lot of ground, the book generally dealt with the issues on a pretty basic level that should be easy for almost everyone to follow. There are important issues in here, dealing with people's inability to properly comprehend probabilities and statistics, as well as the common problems associated with comparing relative magnitudes. The inability of people to grasp some of these concepts has an impact on their ability to make good decisions, and leads them to develop beliefs that aren't strongly based in reality. A worthwhile read, if only to emphasize the importance of these concepts."
3,"Interesting book, bad style","Paulos' book Innumeracy explained basic probability theory very well. However, Paulos' passion for numeracy is strongly manifested in his condescending attitude towards the innumerate. I believe that Paulos would have succeeded in getting his message across without the condescension. Paulos' passion aside, Innumeracy makes for an interesting read."
3,Only okay,"I wanted to get a library started for my Blu-Ray player and thought this would be a good way to kickstart the library. I did not realize the made for tv movies had choppy parts where the commercials should go - and in movies that spread out over 2 nights (like 10.5) the movie ending showed, and a bit later the second night part of the movie was shown. It is okay - but if I had paid full price for the cube, I would have been sorely disappointed."
3,You get what you pay for,"A 10 pack of B-flicks. For forty-bucks, you can't really complain too much. You get 10 BluRay films... for forty-bucks.First, none are worth paying more than five-bucks for. But since they're four-bucks each... not too bad. These are straight to BluRay movies. Skipped the theaters all together.Only buy if you're a collector of movies. The average viewer shouldn't buy these."
4,A Rare Pleasure,"Lugosi makes this film worth it for me. His performance as the religious zealot, Anton Lorenzen is a touching, disturbing effort. He endears himself to you, you love him in a sense. Even when his shipmates are being murdered and suspicions are being aroused, you can't help but enjoy his company with each appearance he makes on screen.The whole cast is dedicated and enjoyable. Everyone gives it their all, and you can see that. The story moves at a steady pace and the dialogue keeps you interested. Even without the intro and concluding footage, the story is fascinating and beautiful. It draws you in with every body that turns up, and keeps you on edge to the very end.A fscinating, brilliant effort. And certainly worth watching if you are at all intersting in thrillers or the great Lugosi."
3,"Not bad, but annoying hero","This book wasn't awful, but not great either. Like another reviewer, I listened to the audio book, and therefore finished it. (Dick Hill's reading improves even the most boring books).My complaint was the character of the hero. It's hard to care about such a blatantly selfish person. There was no one in this novel to really care about. There was some decent action, though."
2,Yawn.,"If you're interested in the everyday life of a cop, maybe this book will be of interest. But remember, each day in their lives can't be filled with action and adventure. To that end, this book delivered -- there was little action and the ""adventure"" was ...well, yawn..... The cop, Jack, was a selfish man that was always thinking of himself first, his wife and everyone else, last. There was some action, but not enough to satisfy my taste, and the adventure...well, was there ""really"" any? If you've got nothing better to do, and I mean nothing, this book may be worth the read. I only finished it because I had paid for the unabridged audio version and it was thus, being read to me. Otherwise, I think I would have given up on it. If you're wondering why I rated the book a ""4"" instead of lower, it's because the book had it ""moments."" A few, but they were there nonetheless."
4,Daley has the cop-thriller genre down to a fine science,"The character development in this novel rates with the best of Daley's works. By the conclusion, one can almost feel the bullets flying at the protagonist and the results are virtually palpable. Daley has the ability to transform what, in many ways, is a rather pedestrian environment into an exciting and adventure packed story, with a heavy dollop of sex and romance thrown in to add to the mix. In this novel, he contrasts the gritty world of the New York street cop with the very different world of the French Finance officer, while showing the real parallels that exist in any law enforcement environment. As an ex-cop himself, he really knows his subject matter, but makes it immensely readable. It is a treat to be both entertained and educated in the workings of the police world. A great read"
3,Kinda average,"This is a fairly hard movie to find, and was only looking for it as a hardcore Blair fan. Blair is barely even in the movie: just a few minutes at the beginning and a few at the end. A inadvertently humorous exploitation flick using the women in prison/women in chains motif. Was wondering why this hadn't been updated to dvd and is only available on vhs. Well, perhaps because it's, mmmmm..........not so good."
5,Hunter plays again,"Charlie Hunter is simply one of the most interesting jazz musicians around today. This album is just as intrigueing as past efforts. The music grooves and embodies that classic jazz feel as well, which is great compared to the droves of smooth jazz musicians that give the genre a bad name. Realize that this is one man playing a guitar and not group containing a bassist and organist. Worth a listen."
5,His best effort so far!,"I just bought this today and I have listened to it three times all the way through. I own all of his past work and I beleive this is his best yet! This CD has more depth, diversity and balance than his past recordings. The use of horns and additional percussions adds the depth and balance. He is still the leader and this is still vintage Charlie but this time the other players balance the overall sound. If you dig Charlie...buy this CD and get your groove on! Also, if you have not seen him live, you should!"
2,c.h. is loosing it...,"...that funky ,hip jazz sound that bridged the gap between old school jazz fans and a younger audience, without beeing unstylish or too technical. I think that with bing, bing, bing (and the following two albums) he took the classic blue note sound into the nineties. this latest release sounds like a couple of music college graduates showing off what they've just learned(the sidekicks that is).sureley they are doing fine playing their instruments - but that's it! gone is the groove and the freshness of the old releases,especially when it comes to the horn lines and improvisations. I mean charlie isn't bad, don't get me wrong. what he does is still unique and I don't mind if an artist grows into something else, but this is the wrong direction!"
4,Groovy jazz,"Charlie Hunter is indicative of jazz's ongoing identity crisis. He doesn't cast the kind of extended lines that burn with forward momentum, but his laid-back restraint has its own kind of appeal."
4,UNDERRATED GEM,"Why doesn't Roberta Flack get the same attention as so many other singers of the 1970s? Is it because she never wrote many of her songs? This is a lovely album from start to finish. The title track, for Don McLean (although not written by Flack) takes on a more powerful lustre in its proper context. 'Jesse' is tear-jerkingly glorious, and 'Suzanne' an unexpected treat."
5,Best album Foreigner ever did!!!,"I have heard Foreigner say that this was their weakest album, but they are wrong. Head games has probably been the most played album on my stereo out of my huge music collection. It never grows old on me. It rocks from the first song until the very end. I love every album by Foreigner, but this one is my favorite by them."
4,"Foreigner does it again, this one rocks!","Head Games was Foreigner's third album in just as many years. It opens with the kick @$$ hard rocker Dirty White Boy, Head Games also included Women, Rev on the Red Line, and the title track. While this is the weakest of Foreigner's first 4 albums it is still a great album. If you've enjoyed the other Foreigner albums you'll also enjoy Head Games."
4,"Nice, large, solid, easy to use",I bought this quick square along with Stanley's contractor grade aluminum framing square. The two together form an awesome team for measuring up square cuts that are too large to do on the table saw and must be done by a straight-edge and power saw. The quick square butts up nicely to your work at any angle and tucking the framing square inbetween the quick square and your work give you a nice extended line to draw or clamp to. I'll reserve the 5th star for longevity of the pivoting arm but it looks solid as most Stanley products are.
5,A Carpenders Greatest Tool,There is an unlimited amount of uses for this large adjustable square once you learn how it works. Get the correct angle of anything or make your own angle.
3,K&N 33-2125 Replacement Air Filter for my 2001.5 Audi S4,"I know K&N has a very good reputation and there cold air system did increase the hp greatly on my 99' F-150. But, there always seems to be a fit issue. For my truck their engineering documentation that was sent with the cold air kit did not completely jive with my truck. So, I had to add lib a bit at times. For my S4 the fit was less than perfect. It just didn't fit in the stock air box the same as the Mann brand filter that I had been using. But, I am looking forward to not having to buy anymore filters. They are very easy to clean."
3,Be careful of your fit!,"Product works and does seem much more durable than the cloth air filters but do be careful. Amazon's fit guide isn't necessarily the most accurate, go to K&N's website to make sure you get the exact model. I ordered this one and it was too small but Amazon did a great job and issued a refund accordingly. Not sure about the claims for better mileage and more hp once you install but it will definitely last longer than the stock air filters."
5,Fantastic air filter,"This filter surely makes a big difference, the car just flies on the road, I've got a turbocharged Audi A4 and this filter booste up the performance along with lowering the mpg. Great filter, for real."
1,K&N 33-2125 Replacement Air Filter,This filter was supposed to fit my 2005 VW Passat 1.8T. It did not. It was too large for the slot making the sides bow in which made the filter useless. It was practically impossible to replace the cover. Stay with the fiber filter used by VW.
2,Cross stitch patterns vs advertisements,"There are no enough cross stitch patterns in thi magazine. When I first subscribed to this magazine, about 3 years ago, it was full of patterns, now it is mostly advertisements. If this continues I probably will not renew my subscription next year. It's not that I don't like the magazine, they just need to consider what the magazine should be. If it is for ads then fine, but not what I expect."
4,"Handy, but too small for all uses","Some have complained about the lack of 'rewind' on the tape-measure-- saying it was almost a manual affair each time. I was able to fix this in .5 seconds after receiving the tape measure: pull the tape measure out about two inches, initiate the tape-lock, then manually push the tape back into the housing (with the lock still activated). Check to make sure it works. After the quick fix, my rating went from 3 stars to 4, since now it works as expected. 1 star dropped because it is simply too short to be useful in basic everyday measuring-- granted it is very small in size, and I can just measure 3ft at a time...big deal. Overall, pleased."
5,Great Handy Measure for a Key Ring,"I had mine for about 5 years before the spring recoil broke. It measures up to 36"" long and is so handy to have in one's pocket! Whenever I go hardware shopping at the home depot store, I have this with me. Invaluable for measuring on the fly! You will not believe how often you use this day to day. Quality product for the most part. Expect the recoil spring to fail after so long, as pocket lint and debris clog the spring.kone"
3,Size is convenient. It could close more easily.,"This measure is light, small, and handy. My only gripe is when it retracts sometimes the tab on the end hangs up and to completely close the tape it must be moved a few millimeters by hand."
5,Just like big brother,"This little measuring tape is just like it's bigger siblings. Locks up well, and stretches to 38 inches so you can measure a full 3 feet without running out of tape. It will hold the extended tape out to a foot without collapsing (if that's something you even need with such a small measurer). Overall just what I expected from Stanley"
4,"Very very good, but the top knotch quality is missing","We all knew Geri would have some success, given her tremondus popularity with Spice Girls. But knowing Geri, she has some better stuff up her sleeve. But it is a smashing song and absolutley marvelous."
5,Awesome CD!,"This is the kind of CD that makes you happy whenever you are down. It has songs that people can really relate to. The whole entire CD gives nothing but positive messages. Also, if you really weren't into the Spice Girls' music, this CD is a lot different. The lyrics are very clever and each song on the album has it's own little style. So you like every single song on the CD and they don't all sound the same. So, this really is an awesome CD. If there was such thing as 6 stars, this album would deserve every single one of them."
1,Poor product and poor costomer service,"I purchased this PCI board a few months ago and It didn't work. I called and talked with the tech support people who eventually said they would send me a new one. Two months later, after multiple emails to them, I have not received the new board and haven't even heard back from them.Don't waste your time. Go with another company."
5,Pokemon Figures Rock,"These little Pokemon figures are beautifully made and were a big hit as a goody bag item for my son's Pokemon birthday party!! The fact that they came in their own little plastic egg made them perfect for the goody bags and extra enticing to the kids. If it were up to my son, he would have loved to keep them all."
5,Pokemon Buildable Figures Gashapon Collection Complete Set of 6 Series II,Fast deliver and good shipping condition
3,Talking About Memories,"I remember getting this album after the stinker skeezer/pleezer and was like dang, this joint is hot. Ya Cold Wanna Be with me was definitely the jam of that summer in D.C. The radio stations played the cover off this song and Mo Bass was getting heavy rotation based on it's go-go flavor (before it was fashionable for N.Y. rappers to even have that sound on any of their singles and albums). Of course the love affair with this lp lasted shortly as I bought Doin It and I didn't even make it past three songs before I pulled the tape out of my tape player in the car and toss it out on I-95. My buddy laughed me outta the car all the way home from The Wiz as he was smart enough to purchase NWA's new album ""Straight Outta Compton"". Hmmn, wonder how that album worked out for him?"
1,They dropped the ball on this one,"After two excellent albums, UTFO put out this piece of tripe. The only thing that would remind you of their ealier stuff is Diss. On everything else they started experimenting with their sound. Now normally I'm a big fan of acts moving beyond their traditional boundaries and exploring new musical routes, but UTFO blew this one big time. It's absolutely horrendous."
3,just one more great cd from the blues brothers,if you dont have this one in your collection you have to bye it
1,Amazon's Mistake,Amazon has made a major mistake in listing this item. If you are looking for a PCIe x1 slot gigabit card you wont get one. I ordered this card and recieved a regular PCI card. the one listed on the title the 9521 is NOT PCIe x1
3,Rescue gets a solid 4 stars to Hero's 2 stars!,"Having both of these releases on vinyl for years, I've really enjoyed the clear, crisp sound of both on CD. The raw strength and R&B power of RESCUE certainly outshines the pop commercialism of HERO. Clarence's rock and roll saxability is starkly evident on both, but a little too bubblegumish on HERO. J.T.Bowen's raw vocals on RESCUE wonderfully complement Clarence's powerful sax. One can only wonder what else we may have gotten out of the Red Bank Rockers (a superb ""bar band"" on the Jersey music scene in the early '80s) had they assembled a second collection of their rock/R&B fused sound."
1,Should not sing,"I got the cd for the sax, which he doesn't play much. Most people who sing on the cd, can't."
4,A truly revealing book,"I have to say that I was very fascinated with what the book had to offer. Learning some of the things that Disney animators get away with in terms of hidden messages and pictures forced me to become aware of what goes on ""behind the scenes."" Being a true Disney fan and an aspiring writer, I loved reading about the actual stories and the final Disney products. While I was not very interested in the ideas for the theme parks, I found the book to be very informative, increasing my excitement to read on. Using the hidden images sections, I actually studied Aladdin and The Lion King to see how acurate the ""accusations"" were. I was truly impressed and would recommend this book for anyone who enjoys ""studying"" the origins of and concepts behind the Disney films"
3,Decent book to have in a Disney or Film fan library,"This book is filled with lots of trivia and behind the scenes stories on almost every Disney animated film from Snow White to Tarzan. However its writing style has trouble following the format it sets up for itself in sorting its information. It does do a great job on explaining the transistions that occur within Disney and how it translated to its film and theme park work.I reccomend Koenig's other books ""Mouse Tales"" and ""Mouse Tales 2"" which for me were much more enjoyable reads (although are more ""gossip"" and storytelling based than a history)"
1,Good- but nothing special,"This book was a bit of a let down, I was lookingforward to a bit of ""inside"" information, but whatwas between the covers held no details of great interest.Info regarding Disney's animated features and parks did not reveal anything new that most people with an interest in this subject wont already know"
4,Disney Cookbook!,"This book immearse u into some of the most memorable stories that Disney ever Produced. The infomation is wriitten perfectly and with lots of transition words too. But even though the title says "".. theme parks"" only a few attractions are showed/ written in the book. This book is great for a movie triva fanastic but not good for a theme park fanastic *_*"
1,HELP! GET ME OUT OF THIS!,THIS SONG MAKES *ME* LIVIN' LA VIDA LOCA! I HATE THIS SONG SO MUCH I WON'T TALK ABOUT IT NO MORE! I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW I HATE IT!
4,Ricky Martin is a great singer &has a great singing career.,"i htink Ricky Martin is a great singer esspecilly, Liva La Vita Loca! i love to watch him on MTV and listen to him on K104. not only is he a great singer and dancer he is also a hottie with bodie. thank you for reading my letter!!"
2,the songs was fast and you can dance to it,the livig la vida locait is very good song to dance to and to sing along with the music
1,"Short on Talent, Long on Hype!","I bought this disc as a novelty - hoping I might find more than that. Nope. The album version is just so-so, but the remixes are a joke. Stick with the true talents in Spanish artists like Javier Garcia, Alejandro Sanz, Shakira, Gilberto Santa Rosa, Manny Manuel, Albita, Ricardo Montaner, India, Olga Tanon, and Eddie Santiago, to name a few. ""Ricky"" will disappear quicker than a dew drop in the desert."
5,Livin in la vida loca ;always gets stuck in my head,The first time I heard ricky martin at the music awards ;I almost died.I ran to the stores and bought all of his cds.I don't care if I can't un derstan latin music I just think it sounds so great.Then I heard livin in la vida loca and went crazy and started to sing along.Now I always call the radio station and request it.
1,Ricky Martin==New Kids On the Block,"On this new album of Ricky Martin, he definitely proves to the public that he is the Revival of the New Kids on the Block. His songs make no sense at all and have no meaning. 'Livin' La Vida Loca' is simply a catchy tune to dance to and by this manage to get teenage girls attention."
1,very dissappointed,Such big hype for this cd. He needs better songs and less noise and a singing coach.
5,"Hot guy with hot music,perfect combination!","I have never seen such a cute guy in my life! But thats not what its about! His music just makes you wanna get up and dance! He has this thing about him that gets you pumped up!! The first words that come to mind when i hear his name or his music are:""Now there's a guy who's got it going on!"""
3,skip the maxi-single,"The remixes on this maxi-single suck. Try and find the 2 track single instead. The Scissorhands remix starts out very promising and then falls flat on it's face when the vocals come in. The drag out his vocals and make him sound like a drag queen. The Pablo Flores mixes of the track are alright, but pale in comparison to the original. Save yourself some cash and buy the single instead of the maxi-single."
2,Signing Naturally,"This is a comprehensive book for American Sign Language. However I am rating this book on its condition, which was very poor for the money paid. The back binder was falling off and the entire book was marked up with side notes in pen. Be careful buying used books!Sharon"
3,"A good ""Starter"" for travel planning","This book covers three main regions including Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia and therefore does not go into too much detail on each region. I would recommend using this book as a good starting point for travel planning, but not if you are looking for lots of details. The book includes items that it describes as being ""hidden"" or off the beaten path, which could prove interesting for many travelers. The sections on lodging could be enhanced more to include additional suggestions. The book does include some useful maps that are very helpful. For more detailed travel information, you may want to read a guide book that covers one state."
2,Hardly Hidden - Nearly identical to Fodor,"I found this book quite frustrating. For a book that billed itself as ""hidden"", it was hardly anything of the sort. I bought it in the hopes that I would find out obscure places, foods and shops. Not only were most of the items identical to Fodor, like Fodor, I found both the restaurant and hotels listings mediocre (who does the food reviews, are they people who think Mac Donald's is the height of gourmet food?). I had better luck searching on-line with my cell phone and picking up the local weekly mags."
2,Very disappointed.,"I had the previous edition, so wanted updated information. In comparing several entries, including my own town, there was no new information. And, on top of that, it is printed on cheaper, newsprint type paper which makes the book bulkier and uglier."
4,Review of this book on Pacific-Coast-Highway-Travel.com,"One of the most thorough guides we've found to Pacific Northwest travel is Hidden Pacific Northwest by Eric Lucas, published by Ulysses Press. See the rest of our review here:[...]"
4,"Like, It's a Total Smile Flick","Simply one of the best Romeo & Juliet re-tellings in film history. More than a teen flick, this is one totally awesome, and very funny movie. A time capsule of the early 80's in all its pretentious innocence."
2,"Horrible movie, great soundtrack","As a child of the 80s, I have heard how awesome ""Valley Girl"" is. I had never seen it so I bought it thinking that it would probably go into my permanent 80s DVD collection. Well, it was a HORRIBLE movie. Poorly written, poorly acted, and it seems to drag on forever. Half way through I was wondering when the plot was going to begin. The shining ""star"" is Nicholas Cage who could not act and still can't. He should have won a razzie for this performance. Rippin' soundtrack though. Very reflective of the early 80s musical climate."
1,only interesting as a 80s study,"This movie is just awful. I bought it because I was curious about the young Nick Cage. Well, he has less wrinkels. The plot of thismovie is: boy falls in love with girl. Its not even clear what he likes about her, but hey, its teen love. Had I seen this movie 10 years earlier I would have thougt all the setting is plain fiction and totally made up but I am afraid that is what was (is) true life for US teens in the 80s. Its not even romantic. Its not funny. Not even her Hippi-parents. Its just shallow. Mightbe useful if you are a teacher to show it in class. It is interesting as a 80s study and shows your children how innocent they ought to be.The only thing worth mentioning for me: I was suprised that Sushi got IN that early. But hey, I am from Germany and compared to LA thats the other side of the moon, right?"
5,A Classic Love Story,"Valley Girl is a fantastic piece of work that showcases the best and worst of the 80's like no other film. It is also one of the best of its genre. Have you watched a teen movie lately? Valley Girl has heart, soul, and a true love of its characters. That is unique for ANY film today.It's a travesty this isn't available on DVD!"
2,"Great Movie, except for the sound transfer by MGM!!!","This movie is a GREAT 80's film. I saw it on HBO the other week, and went and ordered the film. As for MGM, they usually transfer films from the 80s great. They transfered the picture great again with valley girl, HOWEVER, whoever remastered the music in Dolby 5.1 Surround put the music to low, and ruined the way the movie was meant to be shown. However, if u goto Features and change the Sound to English Mono, It plays normal and can watch the movie like it was meant to be seen, to bad without stereo, but hey, sometimes u cant always have what u want. If it wasnt for the sound the movie would get 5 stars. It got 2 just because of the sound transfer. Shame on you MGM! MGM should exchange these discs with fixed copies, like Universal is doing with Back to the Future(WIDESCREEN)."
3,Great movie - production quality sucks.,"This is def one of the great teen flix of the 80's. So why is it packaged like a cheap second-rate pirate copy? MGM have totally let this gem of a movie down. The disc has no label and there are no leaflets or other material that you'd expect with a DVD entitled SPECIAL EDITION. I thought that would at least warrant a disc label. Pathetic for a major league film studio. Makes me wonder if they're going to replace the MGM lion with a hand puppet.NEway, the film quality is clear and sharp, the sound OK and the songs are great to hear again. The disco bathroom makeout scene blows the doors off Enrique's Escape Video for sheer steaminess. How is it that low budget indie movies always look that much more credible?The xtras are good - interviews etc., well worth a look.If you like this film, get the DVD for posterity.If you're looking for great production and packaging, save your money."
4,"Heartfelt story, one MAJOR problem","Valley Girl is a gem from the 80s. There is only one major problem: it's missing the MIDDLE THIRD of a plot. We see the first date, and then Randy shows up at the health food store. Then, we're off to montage land, for what seems like a long series of dates (only to find out it's a week). But then, out of nowhere, our heroine decides to just dump him. WE miss any of the scenes showing the growing pains of their love, the awkwardness of their backgrounds....come on, Martha, gotta pay attention to that now! Could have been a wonderful classic teen film. Instead, it's as good as the sum of its parts."
5,Great.,I receive my movie early. The quality was the same as describe in the internet. I will recommend this buyer.
2,Got the movie but it was in FRENCH,"This is the best 80's movie ever! My sis loves this movie so I was so excited to give this to her for her birthday but when it arrived, it was in FRENCH. Everything about the description implied it was in English. So be cautious when ordering that you're getting the right language!"
5,Valley Girl,It was great to finally get to watch this movie again after so long. Its my girlfriends favorite and weve watched it 5 times already. It brings back alot of memories.
4,Happy :),fast shipping. very good packaging. :) nothing but good things to say about this seller. loved that i got this movie for such a low price
3,Not as pictured.,"I LOVE this movie. SO I was sad to see the real dvd sleeve in the photo, but not on the copy I received. It's some weird, junky, computer printed cover. Totally bummed. Hopefully its legit."
4,A Must See For Fans Of The 80's,"""Valley Girl"" is a gem of a movie. While the dialogue is stilted and the acting is pretty questionable (except for young Nicolas Cage), one cannot help but smile at the film's utter embodiment of everything early 1980's, including clothes and catch-phrases. The plot is a familiar one: two kids from different social groups fall in love and noone wants them to be together (ala ""Pretty in Pink"").Nicolas Cage is good as Randy, a loud but sweet punk rocker who falls for the girl from the Valley, Julie. His is the best performance in the movie by far.The movie is almost worth watching for the soundtrack alone. The soundtrack features Modern English, The Plimsouls, and Josie Cotton. Josie Cotton is the singer at the prom in the movie, too.For those who grew up in the 80's, or are just fans of the decade, this movie is a must-see. And, hey, any movie that has a food fight at the prom can't be all bad."
4,Cage succeeds where Val-dude fails,"Saw this movie ages ago and after many years it still holds up well. Nicholas Cage is awesome, whatever he's in. The story makes me feel young again, and hope that someone can feel about me the way he felt about Julie. Julie and her pals are totally believable Vals."
1,Where'd all the music go? horrid mix on the DVD,"This is a classic for me(for what it is anyway) but this is a horrible version of it. They really changed the feel of the movie by putting the music so very low in the mix. The music is a very important part of this movie, and now all impact it had is lost. It's sad that they would butcher this movie like that."
5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE,"IT WAS SPECTACULAR..I LOVED THIS MOVIE AND I AM GLAD I WAS ABLE TO FIND IT HERE,..THANK YOU AMAZON"
5,Valley Girl,"Twenty years ago, this was a great movie and it still is today. It brings back an easier time to everyone. Nicholas Cage and Deborah Foreman are so cute together. The music is fun and just puts you in a great mood. My favorite quote is when Fred tells Randy that he has a plan to get Randy in with the love of his life and at the same time achieve the grandest form of retribution to the guy that kicked his ass!! Go back to the 80's for 2 hours and enjoy this movie!!"
3,Hilight of 80's flicks!,"Like, Valley Girl is, like, totally, a cool movie! It's all about this guy who falls in love with this girl, who is super popular @ Valley High. He is kind of, uh, not her type, but they manage to work it out in the end. The plot is simple, but this is another one of those movies that you just fall in love with for absolutly NO reason!! :D"
1,stinky stuff,This stuff is awful. It stinks. It's supposed to be unscented. Why does it smell worse than body odor?
4,Frustratingly Good,"While Spring Snow remains my favourite book in this amazing series, The Decay of the Angel is the most... elusive. Mishima's message decays right along side his characters, and that in itself is a work of great artistry. To introduce us to interesting, well realized characters and to slowly over the course of four books degrade them and pull them out of the realm of literature into a kind of near-tabloid reality is as cunning as it is disturbing. This book has a lot going for it and it has a strong message, but what exactly that message is remains to be seen.Trivia fact: After mailing the manuscript for this book Mishima led a failed nationalist uprising and comitted ritual seppuku following his failure. (Or maybe just to save himself having to asnwer: ""what does this mean?!"""
1,???,"I do not give this a one star on the basis of the writing. It is impossible for Mishima not to write brilliantly. But having read the ending multiple times, I confess I cannot comprehend what to make of it. Very frustrating.Unless of course that is precisely what Mishima intends: Sometimes even the most well-thought out human attempt to interpret the meaning of a life (or multiple incarnations) end up blown sky high and we never get to find out what, if anything, was behind it all. Is it possible that, despite the gruesome finish of his physical life, Mishima ended his literary life with a Zen smile?"
3,quest for satoko,"Although a big fan of Mishima's work, I found this, the conclusion to the Sea of Fertility, to be quite an anti-climax. Mishima completed this book on the day in which he finished his own life, not a coincidence. However, by this time in his career he was focused on politics more than literature, a trait that shows through in the sometimes didactic work. Stick to the first two in this series and try to forget this slim volume."
3,needs to specify,I bought this sb not knowing it could only be ran as 2ohm. Unfortunately I bought a 4 ohm amp that was not 2 ohm stable.. Good sub when the amp wasnt in protect mode.. When you buy this sub makesure you get a 2ohm stable amp to run this sub..
5,Reading and Eating with Eileen,"AFTER SAMPLING THE MICROWAVE CRANBERRY PUDDING WITH BUTTER-BRANDY SAUCE(YUM) AT A BOOK SIGNING, AND THEN HAVING THE GOOD FORTUNE OF TRYING THE CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE TART AT THE NEW YORK CHOCOLATE SHOW, I WAS HOOKED. THIS LADY BAKES AS WELL AS SHE WRITES. BUY THIS BOOK AND SEE FOR YOURSELF."
4,I LIKE IT,"I have been using this juicer for several weeks and have to say that it does a great job of juicing a wide variety of fruits, veggies, and grasses. I've done hard and soft items and once you understand juicing order to extract the maximum juice, it becomes very easy. I use it 2-3 times daily and have other family members using it as well (no small feat). My only criticism is the smaller feed chute which means more prep time, but for me it's not a deal breaker. thanks to all who wrote reviews upon which I based my choice of this juicer."
1,5 stars until it broke...,the juicer itself is excellent and does exactly everything it is supposed to do. I found it easy to clean and it made great juice. But then the juicing screen broke last week and Omega's customer service is useless. If they even exist. No answers to my e-mail and they never answer the phone. They keep saying they are experiencing high volumes of calls please hold on and then finally they state to leave a message because no one is available. We only had it 6 months -that is ridiculous and we cannot find a juicing screen to replace it. So we just bought a Breville and I will see how that does. Do not waste your money - I am so upset that we cannot juice wheat grass anymore.
1,"Delivered beginning of April, used 4 times & BROKE beginning of May!",What are my options here?I was juicing wheatgrass when the product broke.I only had this product for a little less than a month - it was delivered to me at the beginning of April.It is only the beginning of May and I have only used it a handful of times. This is ridiculous!You pay this much money for a product - you expect it to work for more than 4 times.I hope I won't have to write about this on my business blogs!
1,Dissapointed,"I was very dissapointed with this model. I had been using the Juice Lady juicer and it produced great juice. The only thing negative about the Juice Lady is that it is a little loud and for optimum juice production you have to clean out the spinning screen part every couple of items. I bought the Omega 2005 because other review I read said that it was extremely quiet - which it is. But, I have found that it produces slush instead of juice. I tried mostly carrots and apples and I got very little juicer.. about a fourth of what I would have gotton from my Juice Lady."
5,Brilliant,"Super easy to break down, clean and put back together compared to centrifugal juicers. Great at extraction - very dry pulp! Works very well with daily juicing. Brilliant."
4,solid and simple,"This is the first veg. juicer I've ever used but after a bit of research I'm very pleased with it so far. It is quiet and very powerful, what ever goes into the chute will be juiced. The amount of product that I can juice before cleaning out the workings is not all that much but then again it also depends on what types of foods I put into the juicer. Mushy foods such as tomatoes, bananas and such just don't turn to juice very well. I've heard that freezing them prior to juicing helps but I've not done that yet.Overall, very satisfied, I'd recommend this to a friend."
5,"Great Jucier, Amazon rocks.","I'm not sure why i'm still amazed by how quickly I get orders from amazon. Placed this order a little over 24 hrs ago, and with prime shipping, it was on my door step by 5pm today.That being said, time for the juicer, I want to eventually use this juicer for everything it can do, initially I wanted to try out ginger root, carrot and spinach. I used hole spinach greens, with the large stems. 90% of the waste was drier than i am used to coming from the JE98XL Breville. I didn't have to use too much greens to get a good amount of juice, and clean up was much much easier than the JE98XL. The omega 8005 comes apart very easily and simply seems like a very well made machine. Very happy with the product."
5,Fantastic!,"Perfect juicer!!! Easy to clean, quiet and super dry pulp. Having a great time grabing greens from the farmers market and juicing them up. Who knew spinach juice with a bit of honey could be so delicious...even my husband agrees!"
5,For the Juicing connoissuer.,I wanted to add that this juice tastes better than the juices ive made with centrifugal juicer and the Champion.The Champion made my juice hot and it took tons of space on counter. This one looks like a showpiece on my counter. The Omega is not bulky.It actually is easier to clean than any juicer ive had.I am amazed that it can juice carrots so well. I thought only centrifugal ones did that better. The pulp maybe a tiny bit bigger with carrots but its a negligible amount of juice.If you care about juicing greens this is the best to get. I dont regret spending the money. It was actually worth it.Also it does oxidize less as i can leave it sitting longer and it still tastes great. which means i can rinse all the parts and then drink my juice. Hah!If you have a business get the Breville as it is a little faster but if youra juicing connoissuer then you would choose the Omega.
2,Juicer not good!,"Pulp has tongs of juice, I am very discouraged with the waste, when juicing large quantities. I do not recommend it!!!"
1,No Power!!! Did Not Work!!!!,Yeah it arrived on time but I would rather it be late in good condition and WORK! It had 0 power and I tried it in different outlets. No success. Complete waste of time and drama with Amazon. Yes I got my refund back promptly. I got the Breville instead and i'm very happy with it!!
2,Like this juicer for veggies but---,"This juicer does a great job with veggies, but the fruit does not juice properly. Fruits do not process correctly and a LOT of the juice collects in the chute and is not extracted--thus--a lot of expensive fruit is wasted. I contacted the company via e-mail for help in correcting this problem, but they did not even respond. I would probably not buy this brand of product again---since company will not help me--I will go elsewhere for my next juicer."
5,omega,great product. Fantastic jus. Easy to use an easy to clean. We would recommend highly to any consumer either experienced are inexperienced in juicing.
2,Way too much of a pain in the neck to use,"I normally use a centrifugal juicer and decided to try a masticating juicer because I have heard they extract more juice and the juice has a longer shelf life, but after using this juicer I found that I didn't really get any more juice than I normally do with the centrifugal juicer and it was such a pain in the neck to use that it would never be worth it to me to use this on a consistent basis. If you are looking for a juicer that is easy to use, this is NOT it. The chute was incredibly small so I literally had to cut everything just to feed it down the cute."
4,A Good Buy**,"I do recommend this juicer, But - do your research before you buy. This is just what I need, but it may not be what you need. I'm happy with it's quality. The discarded pulp from apples and carrots (hard to juice) is very dry. Those fruits didn't produce much juice, but my 8005 sqeezed 'em out for sure. I wish it was a bit easier (faster) to clean. But good things come to those who wait, i guess. I'm happy with this model and would buy it again if I wear it out in 10 years."
3,RELIABLE REVIEW,"I bought this juicer a few months ago.ADV- making juice from carrots and similar vegetables- fast clean- silent and can crush nuts etc.DIS- you cannot use it for making juice from apples or siilar fruits because they are so soft.- price in winter was 229 $ but now is 259! WTF?- 8006 and 8005 are the same but if you buy 8005 you have to put some plastic on the turn OFF/ON button which is located on top of the juicer.- sometimes it wastes your carrots. It so small amount of juice from them.- totally not for grapefruits, lemons and oranges."
5,lovely juicer,"voila and it came..I tried it a couple times since I have it, and I love that juicer., so noiseless and works pretty cool.:))"
5,great juicer,"I had a centrifugal juicer, which left the pulp wet. The Omega's pulp is much drier. Although you must chop the produce smaller for this juicer, the taste and quality of juice from this masticating juicer makes it a superior choice. Much quieter when running. Very easy to use and clean. Not that I'm very likely to be juicing wheat-grass, it's still cool to know my juicer is kick-butt enough to handle that job. :o)I would highly recommend this juicer."
4,The best juicer I ever had,"I love this juicer, I use it 3-4 times a week. Very satisfied customer. The only thing concern me the drum is cracked and to return or replace is already expired????!!!! I bought it :Dec 19th 2012 and expire date to return is Jan 31th this year? I need to replace the drum..."
1,"Terrible product, save your money","I'm terribly disappointed. The feed chute is tiny (barely big enough for two fingers), the tray above the chute doesn't hold anything (most things fall out), clean-up is a nightmare, and it takes forever to get a usable glass of juice.Stick with a centrifugal juicer like the Breville Elite 800, unless you enjoy torturing yourself."
5,better then expected,"not much of a juicer personally, but I wanted to try a cleanse. This bad boy destroyed everything it came in contact with including lettuce and kale. Seems to juice everything just fine and really easy to clean.Not much else to say. Five Stars"
4,I like it a lot so far.,"I'm hoping the level of work this machine puts out continues. I've used it about 4-5 times and most recently its been making odd sounds. I wondered if I was using it too long? The directions said don't use it more than 30"" at a time. This was not more than 15"". I'm hoping it was a good choice. Otherwise I love it."
4,Great but lots of pulp,"Very powerful, creates a lot of pulp/waste when juicing vegetables.Made penaut butter from Virginia salted peanuts - very dry paste, had to add some oilve oil when grinding otherwise the grinder cone stalled and had to reverse slightly to get moving."
5,Omega Juicer,I love this machine because the pulp is dry when I finish juicing. I didn't realize it until I juiced one time; I was throwing a portion of my juice on the compost pile. It doesn't compare with the commercial juicers I've purchased in retail stores in the past. The noise level is low compared with the commercial machines.I would recommend this juicer to others that juice.
1,Broke in less than 45 days,"This made juice great, but it would only work in reverse after just 45 days. Also, it has a very small mouth to put the fruits and vegetables through. Because the mouth is so small, it requires a lot more preperation in cutting and pushing through in order to make the juice."
4,Easy chilling,This was a very nice machine easy-to-use easily clean very nice strong motor easily put away compact goes nice with other appliances
4,Quiet but strong,"I have purchased this juicer after buying at least 5 different juicers that have let me down. This is the first masticating juicer i've purchased and i am happy with it. Easy to use, easy to clean, your fresh juice will be ready in no time. The omega juicers make it easier to incorporate more healthy options in your diet. I highly reccomend it!"
2,Wish I hadn't purchased this,"I had a Champion juicer for 15 years that finally wore out, so I bought this one. I've been using it for about two weeks. It's ok for juicing if you just want a little juice at a time, but I like to do juice fasts and drink 32 to 64 oz. of juice per day while on them. It will take me an hour to make that much (at least). It is also hard to take apart and put back together. For the price, I would have thought it would have more power. Very disappointed."
5,Omega Juicer,The Omega J8005 Nutrition Center Single-Gear Commercial Masticating Juicer works great. Happy to have it. Arrived perfect and on time.
2,Not the Best Juicer Built,"If you are in a hurry, this is not the machine you want to purchase. The attachments are cheaply built with thin plastic; and, I just hope that it doesn't break before I get my value from the money I paid to Amazon. The juicer waist is not as dry as they should be....and I am not going to push the scrapes through to get more juice. The motor is quite, but the plastic attachment makes noise when it turns. It also doesn't hold stiff in the machine housing and cycles in an up and down motion as it turns. As cheap of an attachment it is, I would fear placing any downward pressure on the food items as I loaded them into the machine will snap off the Auger/drum assembly"
1,Sent it back,"Don't waste your time, I expected it to at least work, wont even grind coffee beans 1 at a time, and jams up with one small piece of carrot. I really tried hard and finally said forget it and sent it back for refund. The worst part was I was excited about getting it the last 3 days since I ordered it."
1,This product is highly dangerous! The engine is burning!,Item ordered few week ago. A white smoke and a burning smell appeared immediately after switching it on. Then the juice maker switched off. I returned it and ask for a replacement. The second item was delivered today and the same problem happened. There is a major defect with that product. This is highly disappointing as it shows that no action was taken after I returned the first defective product. Also Amazon reimbursed only $ 20 for the return cost from Hong Kong to the USA while it costed me 9 times more.
1,very slow and heats up,"I bought this a couple months ago, first time using it this past weekend, extremely slow and it got hot."
4,Pretty fab,"This is an awesome juicer. I really can't think of anything bad to say about it, all ""issues"" I've had have turned out to be user error and I can get juice out of ANYTHING! The only thing I'm having issues with is tomatoes, and I think I just need to separate the tomato out so it doesn't all go through at once. Seriously, it looks nice, it's quiet, it juices like a dream, you can't go wrong!"
1,Do not buy,I've been juicing wheatgrass and the Juicing screen cracked within the 2nd week. I ordered another juicing screen and that broke also. I definitely do not recommend this item.
5,Wonderful cookbook,"I am giving this cookbook five stars even though I have not tried all the recipes, and although not all the ones I tried came out good. I have a son that has many food allergies, and I am a mother who only feeds my family whole grains and whole foods. My children love, love, love, all the pancake, waffle and muffin recipes in this book! They are wonderful, and extreamly healthy for you, and I feel so good about feeding them to my family. We like the pancakes and waffles drizzled with a little flax oil and organic butter, or Ghee if there is an allergy, and pure maple syrup. I use buckwheat flour for the buckwheat pancakes instead of grinding white buckwheat flour and they are fantastic! The recipes that I mentioned didn't come out, I can't recall now, but they were a few of the cookies. Also, we love the crockpot chicken and veggies, you make gravy out of the drippings with ground oats...awesome!"
5,Great~,"My step mom just found out she's allergic to wheat, corn and milk. So, like, everything. This should do the trick!"
4,Allergy Help,My wife needed help in preparing meals after I showed sensitivity to many foods. The Allergy Self-Help Cookbooksolved many problems. I have found I am most sensitive to wheat products.After consulting the book several times my wife has established a routine for preparing wheat free meals. It has been very helpful because my negative symtoms have mostly disappeared. There are other foods that showed sensitivity when I had the allergy sensitivty test. Have not had time to isolate several other foods that showed sensitivity!!
1,Food allergy support group leader,"""Yeast free"" not, ""nut free"" not, ""soy free"" not, allergen free like the book claims -NOT. There are allergens throughout the entire book! There were only a couple I could use out of the 350 recipes!"
1,Misleading Name for your book,"I was VERY disappointed when I received your book, the title indicates that the recipes are wheat-free....etc. In actuality some of the recipes are wheat free, some are milk-free, some are egg free, some are corn-free, etc. I was (past-tense) excited when I saw your book, as my daughter and I have to avoid these ingredients plus many more and I was tired of ""making up"" recipes on my own, I thought finally someone has done the footwork for me, however I was sadly mistaken, I have to modify theses recipes as much as my own, so I'll continue on my own.Signed,Disappointed in Wyoming"
2,Not that impressed,"This cookbook is not very helpful, as it contains a lot of ingredients that I don't normally keep in my kitchen. Also, yeast is in a lot of the recipes, and yeast is one of the things my son is allergic to. I'm better off reworking my own old recipes around his allergies. Thanks but no thanks."
3,Not free from EVERYTHING,"My sister was diagnosed with MS last year and her diet had to change significantly. No gluten, yeast, sugar, meat, eggs, the list goes on and on. Purchased this for her to help her in her struggle to find things to eat. The front of the book states that all the recipes are free from these allergens, but inside there are some recipes that included eggs and other things that it stated the recipes were ""free"" from. Maybe it was my mistake, but I was a little disappointed. I am giving it 3 stars still because there are a ton of recipes that she CAN use in the book, I was just upset that now she has to carefully read each one to make sure she can consume all the ingredients. With MS, a full time job, and 3 kids I was hoping to make her life a little less stressful. Wishful thinking I suppose."
5,Perfect,I got this for my wife and she says it is perfect. She wishes it was a little bigger but loves it.
2,unstart,Ihad one before that worked fine until it would no longer take a charge(about 3 years). The replacement did not have a power plug that fit my phone.
2,Only Lastest 3 Years,Unit only worked for 3 years before it developed problems which caused my base unit to not function.
4,"Light works well, bulbs were bad","I replaced four outdoor lights with two light units. Two units (four lights) came with bad bulbs. Disappointing that so many bulbs were either broken during shipping or defective.Lights work well. Dusk to dawn setting works well.These lights allow for bulb access from the front too, instead of the back like some lights. Makes screw driver access much easier and comes in really handy with so many bad bulbs.In summary - I like the lights, would order more, but would also order extra bulbs at the same time."
1,Too Sensitive,"This light is WAY too sensitive. I adjusted it to ""MIN"" and it was still going off constantly throughout the night. The next day I adjusted the angle of the sensor and the lights. It made no difference. There is nothing but trees and bushes behind our house where the light was set up. I took it back to the store and bought the Heath Zenith SL-5408 and it is working fine. The downsides of the SL-5408 are that it only provides 110 degrees of monitoring vs 260, it does not include the bulbs, and the detection range is shorter."
4,Worth the price,"Only complaint is that the lamps don't adjust vertically. I mounted the fixture about 15' up on the gable. The lamps come on with motion, as they should, but the lights are aimed way off in the distance."
2,Security lighting not!,"Purchased 3 of these security lights several months ago and they have been nothing but a pain since. The sensor settings will not prevent a breeze from setting them off. The end result is blown T3 lamps in a very short time because of the on/off routines. The fixtures I replaced were more than 10 years old and made by the same vendor. They worked flawless and lasted. So much for modern improvements.If you do buy this model, plan on extra T3 bulbs and plan on it continuously going off/on all night long. I would not recommend this product anymore. The quality has nose dived into the dirt."
1,security light,"This light does not function properly. After dark,the light goes on and off at will.Cannot adjust it.Also the bulbs last only about 6 weeks."
4,Motion garage light,Very good light. Works exactly as promised. Easy to install. Slightly confusing instructions regarding set-up.
1,Waste of money,"I actually purchased the round like version of this model but have the same problem of 23 other reviewers of this product. Purchased 5 lights for new home construction, and like others, light will NOT turn off after sensing motion. Lights stays on ALL night long, read other reviews, light has hidden flaw that Heath Zenith knows about but continues to sell light...I cannot return anymore, took too long troubleshooting light thinking home wiring was the issue, turns out its the light all along. Too bad, concept is good but flaw is HUGE problem that I cannot live with. Will throw these in trash and purchase new lights from another company. Quality engineer for this product should be fired..."
1,lasted 5 days,I had the same problem as some other reviews here did with the lights staying on all night. Even after adjusting to the minimum sensitivity setting the lights still stayed on all night long. after the 5th day I noticed one of the two lights no longer worked. sure enough one of the halogen lights had burned out. It's been two weeks now and the 2nd bulb is still working. with the light staying on all night it's only a matter of time before the second light burns out. do not buy this product!
1,Big problems! Don't buy.,"I have 5 of these lights. I have had to replace everyone of them several times, some of them when installed during testing phase. They fail to turn on when motion is detected. I can see the red light on the motion sensor flashing which indicates motion sensed but lights do not come on. I got these as an alternative to leaving lights on all night because of robberies in the neighborhood. It's obvious that a light turning on gets your attention better than looking outside every 10 min which I find myself doing now since these lights don't do what they are supposed to do. I have 4 of 5 on ground fault protection but all act identically. So far the only benefit to them is the low profile. As soon as I can find a similar profile light these will be scrapped."
4,The wind sets it off,"Not really happy with these motion sensors, we are still messing with the settings because the wind sets it off."
4,"Easy to install, does a good job","Installed these in place of my old porch light in about 15 minutes.These work as advertised, and so far work quite well (I've had my unit for a few days now).The motion sensor however is least sensitive to motion headed directly towards it, and in my small fenced yard, a person walking from the gate towards the door falls right into this weak-sensing-area. It still does pick up the motion, just a second or two later than motion elsewhere in the yard.Overall I'm very pleased with the product."
2,Open Box/Refurb???,"The product showed up quickly, but I was immediately put off by the condition of the box. It was beat up and had holes punctured in the side, and the lights inside had scuffs and markings on them. It is not working and this seller appears to send open box products and refurbished ones and tries to pass them off as new. Just a warning. I will update the outcome."
4,Very Interesting!,"Very interesting book and easy read. If you are in the field of sleep medicine, this is a very interesting enhancement as to the historical view of sleep. Be aware that it was written some time ago so not all of the facts are up-to-date."
2,The lines demarcating each temperature are to close together for the age children shown in their ads.,I bought it for my preK class so I could put pictures showing people at the given temperatures so they could see what the mercury level means. There simply isn't enough space between 32 degrees and 70 degrees to accomplish that.
2,Interesting but incorrect,"Hannie, D.E., et al. have demonstrated that Chen's approach is correct only for angles that are multiples of 90 degrees. For all other angles it is incorrect, deviating systematically from an exact trisection. Nonetheless, Chen's approach provides food for thought, and might be the basis for other work. Note: this book clearly was written by a non-native speaker and would have benefitted from further editing."
3,He may not offer proof but . . .,"Though his theory of trisection may have been proven invalid, Chen does offer evidence against entirely algebraic proofs for geometric problems. Need I remind the mathematicians out there that numbers are representational? Since numbers represent measurement (in geometry) and since some measurement cannot yet be fully represented by numbers (i.e. pi), number-based theories may not be adequate descriptors.[By the way, only a fool offers lack of proof as proof of a lack. Either come up with a purely geometric proof of impossability or do not speak ill of those who attempt to solve the ""impossible.""]"
5,A great album from beginning to end,"With this album Pete Townshend shows us what he's capable of on his own, which is every bit as good as anything he's done with The Who. The hits are good but so are the songs you'll never hear on the radio."
4,Excellent solo effort that does NOT give me the creeps!,"I agree with the previous reviewer (Sanity Inspector) that this is a musically glorious album. However, I am dismayed that someone open-minded enough to enjoy this music would get the ""creeps"" from the album's more introspective numbers and somehow find this album ""adulterated"" just because Townshend recently suggested that he is bisexual. Why would any enlightened individual be bothered with a man (or woman) expressing his (or her) love or attraction for another adult human? For me, this adds even more depth to an already wonderful album. The previous reviewer would probably do well to avoid exploring the meaning behind the music of his other favorate artists. The Sanity Inspector needs to inpect his own."
3,Better with the Who together.....,"Although this is only one of a few of Pete Townshend's solo works, I personally feel that Pete was a much better songwriter with the Who than without. As a solo artist, there are only a few songs on this CD, ""Empty Glass"" that caught my attention; namely ""Rough Boys"", ""Let My Love Open The Door"", and ""Gonna Get Ya"". While Pete can still rock on this CD, he doesn't show the bravado as he did on the early Who works, like ""Live at Leeds"", ""Tommy"", ""Who's Next"", and ""Quadrophrenia"". In my mind, THAT was The Who I want to remember; that had consistently good songs throughout the album that qualified them as mega-rock-stars. Pete can still rock on the few cuts from ""Empty Glass"" I mentioned, but doesn't do as well elsewhere on the CD. Dang, I miss the old Who...."
1,poor product,"this was not CE Ferulic inside the bottle. I took it to a skin doctor practice, they advised me it was a different product. NOT VERY HAPPY since i paid alot of money for it. thanks for asking???????????"
4,All is great except...,"The thermostat works great. The only beef I have with it is that the batteries fall out relatively easily. There isn't a guard that keeps them in, only a couple of 'teeth' on one and the pressure of the spring holding the other. It's a pain when you spend 10 minutes programing it, the batteries pop out and then you have to reprogram the entire thing over again.As a thermostat it works as advertised, just a design issue."
2,"Does what it claims, but.","Easy to install and turn on.A pain in the buns to program, that takes some time.The real kicker is if you have carpeting in your house you will spend several hours resetting and reprogramming the unit. Thought it was just an issue with mine but my buddie has the same trouble with his.When you have static electricity built up on your body and touch the thermostat it shocks it hard enough to go blank or do some weird things with the screen. This resets the darn thing and you have to reprogram it.I suppose if you were to set it and forget it you would get along just fine. Just remember to write down your settings the first time you set it up, that might save you some time."
5,Easy to Install and works like a charm,Easy to install.Easy to program.Has been working smoothly since last 3 months.
4,good value and nice set of features.,"ONe of the few programmable thermostats that has energy monitor, in its price range. The unit cycles between +1/-1 degree F. It does not keep the room temperature as constant as some other similar devices. On the flip side to this- it does not cycle the furnance as often (less wear and tear or the machinery). The battery retainer in mine unit is a bit loose, requiring a bit of tape to ensure they do not fall off, when the cover if lifed to make adjustment of the controls."
4,Great Price,We purchased four of these for our church to program A/C and heat on an Energy Saving schedule. Each was easy to install; program and they operate as stated.
2,too many bells & whistles,"this is a pretty good product except that the programming functions are way too complicated with features that are hard to implement and rarely needed. otherwise, a good buy for the price. if you're willing to spend a little more, consider the honeywell...very user friendly.after having lived with this thermostat for a few years, i've decided to replace it with one thats more intuitive and easier to program and use."
2,Not a Replacement,"Be careful if you are trying to buy a replacement. Hunter Fan Co told me that they do not have a replacement for my old thermostat. My old one has a 7-pin (wires) connection coming out of the wall & this thermostat (44360) has 6 pins. My old one works, but I wanted to buy an upgrade....no luck. I guess I'm stuck with my old one and mailing back the new one."
1,OVERPRICED GARBAGE.,"After years of dealing with this super-sensitive electro whatever, and having it work correctly 1 out of 10 times, this was finally tossed in the garbage and replaced with a basic scale that does not require 3 different types of hard to find batteries and have different times for needing replacement."
3,Bad news,"It is too complicated to set up, and I have it stored in my garage in case a GENIUS wants to buy it from me."
2,well designed unit but a little installation clue,"I like the value of the product and the function built in it.However installation is little difficult for an average handy man like me.The wall plate and the body does not fit easily. the body comes loose after closure, which may cause to disconnecting the circuits and causes malfunction of heating and air conditioning system. I will try to solve the problem with the Amazon and Hunter but feel like I may end up returning of the unit."
2,Cheaply made,"The one piece that keeps this unit attached firmly to the mounting plate on the wall is a very flimsy piece of plastic. As soon as I tried to mount it for the first time, the piece snapped. Now my fancy new thermostat is accented by some fancy new duct tape. I have a hard time believing this model tested for physical quality."
4,Very reliable thermostat for the price,"It was hard to decide whether I should pay more to get the touch screen type or save money with this one. After reading others' review, I decided to try this thermostat, since it has such a good price and ships free from Amazon.My husband teased me how long the manual was; however, it wasn't that difficult to follow. Now that the thermostat is all set to exactly how we like, I realized that we really don't even need to touch it again. We are glad that we didn't spend the extra money for the touch-screen type."
2,Does not go down to 32 degrees as advertised,"The technical details on Amazon specifically state that this thermoset has a range of 32 - 99 degrees F.Upon installation I found it would only go down to 45 degrees. I confirmed with Hunter technical support that all Hunter thermostats have a minimum temp setting of 45 degrees, not 32 as advertised.I needed a low temp thermostat for a vacation home where it occasionally drops below freezing. Because of this, this thermostat will be returned. Other than that, the thermostat appears to work well and looks good, and is a pretty good deal."
1,Worthless,"If you like a thermostat that forgets that it is on vacation mode 2 days into the vacation, get this one. There is nothing like refrigerating an empty house! If you like your ""smart"" thermostat to forget the time or date, but usually not both, every once in a while, get this one. If you like your thermostat to read 3* warmer than every other thermometer in the house, get this one. You can get all this even with fresh batteries. But really, it will work perfectly for about 6 months. If you are moving soon, the new tenants will live it."
1,Can't program and save both (Heat and Cool) individual seasons.,You can't program individual seasons and save both which makes no sense. Every time you change seasons (from Heat to Cool or vise-versa) you have to reprogram it. I called their technical support to confirm and sad to say it's true. What was Hunter thinking??
2,"AC works well, could never hook up heat","I like this thermostat for AC use and the programmable feature save me money, since I could program it to turn to 80 degrees when no is home. Hoever I could not get the heat to work with it. The AC tech that I called said I have a straght heat unit, no Heat Pump. When ever I turned the heat on, the AC and the heat worked at the same time."
2,Door won't close,I have the product but when we tried to install it the cover won't close and therefore it won't operate.
4,"Easy, breezy!","I needed one of these because I was concerned with my unnecessary power usages. I was intimidated at first, but this is one of the more simple projects I have done and it paid off. You can program this device to suit your personal needs and it will bring your energy costs down and that's good for the planet!!! The instructions are straight forward and everything is simple. Do yourself and the planet a favor, get one of these!"
2,Only covers Tokyo and Kyoto????,"I like most of Rudy's travel guides, but this one is really limited. It has a limited amount of information on Tokyo and Kyoto, to the point of being almost useless. This would be the equivalent of someone making a travel guide for the US, and all it included was 15 minutes of Seattle and 15 minutes of Detroit. Think of any place that you really know and like; how much could you show them in 15 minutes?Kyoto and Tokyo both need their own 40 minute plus video, and that is only two major cities of Japan, and no smaller cities or countryside.If that isn't bad enough, although Kyoto is known for its gardens, instead of showing as much footage of the gardens, he spends most of his time talking to one gardener about maintaining it."
2,I was disappointed,"I bought this Blu-Ray and I was expecting a show that actually took a look at what makes Beautiful Japan. Sure the locations are pretty and beautiful but without any cultural insight it is lost on viewers. Some effort to provide genuine cultural insight would have been appreciated. He shows you a traditional Japanese inn but instead of following the tradition of donning a yukata (Japanese summer kimono) he just plops down and eats. Japan is not a place where you go and just look around. You need to immerse yourself and leave behind your Western culture. I was disappointed at what appears to be a lack of interest on Mr. Maxa's part where it seems like he is there because he is forced to. For a true look at beautiful Japan where the gem that is this truly unique culture is genuinely displayed, try Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations (Season 4 Episode 16). One hour of what a travel series should be like."
3,Stanley Chalk line,"The product is of the quality that Stanley has had (very good), however I selected one in the color yellow and recieved a silver one. The shipper never stated or informed me of this and am disappointed. The finish of the silver item is lacking the long term endurance that I've noticed from the yellow enamel paint (previously owned) and (silver) will make this item difficult to see, as this item is also used as a plumb bob. I've also used this item (previously) with a transit in a pinch."
3,Not bad,"This chalk box is metal and is tough, will hold up in a tool box. The down side is it looses chalk out the string hole when box is full of chalk."
3,"HIUDINI, TARZAN AND THE PERFECT MAN","INTERESTING BOOK, MY HUSBAND PLAYED TARZAN IN A 1959 MGM REMAKE OF TARZAN THE APE MAN. SO HE IS ALWAYS INTERESTED IN ANYTHING TARZAN. WE ALSO GAVE A COPY TO A FRIEND/TARZAN COLLECTOR."
5,very cute duvet cover,"This duvet cover is perfect for girls of every age! I agree that pictures don't do it justice. The colors are very sweet - not too bold, not pastel- it is well made and the most important to me it's soft at the top so that you can sleep in comfort. The twin size fits just fine. I bought two for my daughters and i recommend it to anyone who wants something to keep for years."
3,Messed up by other reviews,"After reading the other reviews stating these were mini sticks, I ordered them, since that's what I need. THESE ARE NOT MINI STICKS. ""Mini"" and ""Standard"" are labels referring to the diameter of the stick, not the length. These are 4"" standard-sized. If you have a gun which needs a 10"" stick, these will not work. If you have a mini gun, these will not work, since the diameter is too large."
1,Misleading description,Glue sticks said to be regular were in fact mini. Spent good money on a product that was useless to me.
3,"A bit condescending, but interesting","I found the book interesting, but there was an undercurrent of snobbishness. The author ""tries"" to be ""fair and understanding"" to romance books and readers. However, the underlying theme I got from this study was ""I only read these books for my thesis, I would NEVER personally enjoy them!"" which is a great pity. This is a book that is interesting to read for the background and analysis contained within. But, if you are a romance reader, as I am, you will be tempted to contact the author and educate her. Don't try, it never works."
3,Strongly Feminist,"I found the responses of the individuals interviewed interesting, but the analysis rather uninteresting. Unless you are a proponent of feminist theory the authors thoughts and interpretations of the women's reasons for reading romance novels is bound to seem pretty suspect. She does own up to this in the introduction, and the material is still interesting, I just got sick of hearing about patriarchal marriages mighty quick."
2,Panasonic Refurb KXTG5673B,"I chose Panasonic because of its great reputation for quality products. This product is not what I expected. It lacks many features, such as lighted keypad, mute button and a clip for when you want to use your headset. My first set of phones, same model, broke after 2 months. I do not recommend this model. I gave it two stars because you can make and receive calls."
5,refirbished panasonic telephone,Product was in mint condition and was sent and received within a weeks time. Extremely satisfied with purchase.
3,A brief look into life in the age of knights,This is a very funny book because it tells you much about the way people live and think long ago. You may find that the people in that era view things in a very different way.
4,An inspiring account with a minor flaw.,"The Passing of the Armies offers readers the opportunity to experience the trials and triumphs of the Civil War through the personal recollections of an authentic American hero. However, it is my opinion that the introduction by Brooks D. Simpson serves to disrupt the first hand experiences of Joshua Chamberlain by calling into question Chamberlain's accuracy of events and his personal motives. Passing of the Armies should stand as one man's first hand account of his life, leaving his critics to write their own book."
2,EDITOR NEEDED,"THIS BOOK WAS PUBLISHED AFTER GENERAL CHAMBERLAIN'S DEATH, AND WAS EDITED BY HIS CHILDREN AND OTHERS- IT IS ALMOST UNREABLE, AS IT IS FULL OF MISSPELLINGS AND INCOHERENT SENTENCES. I KNOW CHAMBERLAIN WAS A COMPETENT WRITER, AND IT WOULD BE BETTER TO BUY HIS BOOK ""BAYONET FORWARD"", WHICH COVERS THE APPOMATOX CAMPAIGN, AND MANY OTHERS. THAT BOOK IS CLEAR AND READABLE, AND CONTAINS FASCINATING HISTORY."
4,Very Good Record.,"This is the final record Jean-Luc Ponty made with suites, and he goes out with a bang, putting 2 on this one. The first suite, Mystical Adventures, sounds like the title. Mystical. I love it. And each part smoothly goes into the next. It's a very mysterious piece, almost like the album cover. I imagine a forest with fog. And then the 2nd is Final Truth, a short but sweet melody. He also covers Stevie Wonder's ""As"" on this record, and does a good job. Overall, an excellent album."
2,"Okay, but waste of talent","I've thought Shanice was talented ever since 'I Love Your Smile', but was disappointed by this mediocre song. It borrows way too much from other r&b songs and the lyrics are unoriginal, even though Shanice sings them well. The Snippets sound good, though."
2,"Okay, but a waste of talent","? ught Shanice was talented ever since 'I Love Your Smile', but was disappointed by this mediocre song. It borrows way too much from other r&b songs and the lyrics are unoriginal, even though Shanice sings them well. The Snippets sound good, though."
3,This book has two subjects,"This book has two subjects. First, it explains how, when, and why the company has considerable political power in Washington state politics. Second, the paradox of growth is examined. A highly desirable area will attract a large number of people - and then become less desirable. This is when the anti growth coalition becomes powerful.In many ways the Boeing Company is very good for the area. All of its production goes out of the area - hence all the money that it spends locally on wages and supplies is pure gain for the area. Furthermore it pays well and employs 50,000 to 75,000 people in the area.Yet, the anti growth forces can be just as powerful as the Boeing Company."
4,very very good....,"This cd is so good! It contains a great variety of different electronic groups showing that Depeche Mode has inspired many. The version of little 15 is amazing, God Module(ebm) makes it a bit creapy. For the most part though you get a lot of synth-pop groups that I myself have gone out and bought their stuff at adifferentdrum.com. This cd is a good eye opener to the great music that's out there, but not so well known. There are a couple songs that one wouldn't dought being Depeche Mode themselves. Get this cd. You won't regret it and if you do then that would be a bit odd..."
4,Good first video game,"We bought this for our 3yo for his first video game. It is a really good starter game (learning how to use the controls, basics of game play...). The story line and pace are good for this age. I imagine a more experienced video game player would get through it fairly quickly but this game isn't really for them. This is an early childhood rated game.The activities that the child needs to do are pretty age appropriate. Some are a little easy, even for a 3 year old, but most are just right or a bit harder.A good game for a new gamer. Our son really enjoys watching us play it as he still hasn't mastered video game play."
4,Good for little kids,"My husband bought this for my 3 year old. He thought it would be good for him to be able to play the GameCube too. He likes it, but can't always get where he wants to go, though I must admit, he caught on pretty quick. He likes to have help sometimes b/c he gets frustrated. For those who like Dora, they will like this game. MY 3 year old prefers his Pooh Bear game b/c it's geared a little more towards pre-schooler's. He does play this game too. Maybe he'll do a little better when he's four."
5,great game for young children,"I agree with everyone else, a child will love this game and it also helps develop hand and eye skills. Problem solving, not on a level of any difficulty but will also help a child develop a desire to explore which is a prelude to learning. A 3 year old will love this."
1,Safe you money!,I dont think this was a vary good game at all.I saw it on the shelf at toys R us and thought it whould be a fun game for my 5 year old.Wean i got home he beat it in about 20 minuits i whatched him play it thare wasent that much to do in it expect bulid a rocket avoid swiper drive a car and fly to the purple planet.After the game my son was vary upset so we went back after lunch and we saw a game called sonic the hedgehog it was alot more callengeing for him and it didnt take about 3 minuits to load like the other one did we also got are 30$ back wean we returend it.We have had to other dora games that wernt so good ether I think that Nick.Jr jest wants your money on these sort games that get you so upset.I think you should choose something else besides this
5,In the shadows they lurk,"After months of anticipation, ""Cloak & Dagger"" has arrived. This work reveals, for the DM of course, some startling events in the lands of Faerun. This source book is filled with a myriad of realms lore and information, as well as hooks for bringing these nefarious organizations to play in your realms campaign. For many of us, this is what we've been waiting for, and calling to the powers-that-be about. Finally, these intrigue riddled organizations are made flesh for the cunning game master: The Shadow Thieves, The Knghts of the Shield, The Iron Throne, and the Night Masks to name only a few. But more importantly, it reveals a great shift in the balance. What is it? I won't ruin it, but I'll tell you it has to do with the Zhentarim, and Manshoon himself! If you're a Forgotten Realms DM, and you want to spice up the intrigue in your campaign, even if you don't like using power groups in your games, you owe it to yourself to pick this up. You will not be sorry!"
5,A great teaching aid,"I found this book to be a wonderful resource for both study and teaching. The author provides great insight as to the apparent and deeper meaning of the ""bible's book on education"". The application commentary sets this book apart from other Proverb commentaries."
2,Not their best,"This was very much a transitional album for Genesis, and it shows. Some of the songs -- ""Undertow,"" ""Burning Rope,"" the lovely ""Follow You Follow Me"" -- are as gorgeous as anything else in the band's enormous catalogue, but a good many others seem underwritten, overplayed or forgettable. Genesis recorded this album quickly, and did so in the wake of guitarist Steve Hackett's departure, so it's understandable that the album doesn't measure up to early masterpieces like ""Foxtrot"" or their later self-titled collection of pop gems. For new listeners, this wouldn't be the first -- or even the fourth or fifth -- Genesis album that I'd recommend, but it does have three or four excellent songs that make it worth coming back to."
2,No wonder Steve Hackett left the band,"Ugh. No wonder Steve Hackett left the band. An uneasy attempt at mixing prog rock musical elements and pop music. Nevertheless, the band members' musicianship is still much in evidence."
2,Weak and insipid,"This album lacks the kick and stamina of A Trick of theTail. Only two songs are worth listening to, ""Burning Rope"" and ""Deep in the Motherlode"". Otherwise, this album is quite bland and middle-of-the-road."
2,New furniture,"Imagine inheriting a beautiful old house in the county, full of antique, timeless furniture and art. But times get rough and all the stuff has to be sold, to be replaced by replicas. Do't worry, the interior designer says. It will look genuine. But of course we'll have to use more current materials. ATTWT is the moment they started bringing in the new furniture. Well, eventually you get used to it (Duke). But not now."
3,Let The Decline Begin,"The first album as a threesome. Not as good as Wind And Wuthering, but better than anything else they'll do in the future. With the exception of Duke, which I like more than this one, and the self-titled album, which I like a lot, Genesis has the unique ability of making an album that's a little worse than the one before it.Don't get me wrong. This album has its moments. ""Many Too Many"" and ""Snowbound"" are hidden gems. Still a worthy collection."
1,Why this people hold the name genesis?,"I tried to listen this album from begining till end for years, but I never succeed. I give up on the third or fourth song because this music horor is absolutely unlistening. Boring, stupid and all in all the worst Genesis album ever."
2,Computer Catastrophe!,"I was very excited to hear the remastered sound of this CD by first playing it through my computer speakers on my iMac and then hurriedly transferring it to my iPod. One major problem: the CD would not even load in my computer. I tried three times but it ejected the disc every time! Anyone else having this issue............?By the way, I did give it two stars in place of the four that I thought that I would be giving it based on my familiarity and happiness with the music."
2,Mediocre,"And Then There Were Three was the final album of Genesis' middle period (1976-1978) and first album without Steve Hackett. Steve was the final cog in the wheel of Genesis as a glorious prog rock band. With this album Genesis made an album with only 2 highlights Burning Rope and The Lady Lies and 3 ok songs Ballad Of Big, Deep In The Motherlode and Down And Out (a critical stab at Steve Hackett for his departure due to the more commercial and less creative sound cropping up in Genesis). The rest of the album is awful."
3,The weak point before Duke,"Although this album has some fine songs (Burning Rope, Down And Out, The Lady Lies, Snowbound), it is overall a bit 'weak'. They were trying too hard to make accessible songs. The mix is overly-compressed, making Collin's drums barely audible. If Duke, the following album from 1980 is considered as the last treasure of the progressive era, then I would leave And Then There Were Three out of the progressive catalog. As a fan of the old Genesis camp, I find Duke (despite it's strong hints for the 80s Genesis)a stronger album than this one.If you're an 80s Genesis fan trying to give a listen to the 70s Genesis, start with A Trick or Wind & Wuthering. Overall, this CD leaves no staggering impression...."
3,The trio's first together is a welcome return,"In their first recording after the departure of Peter Gabriel, Genesis was left with the personnel that would take them until the mid-1990's. Phil Collins, Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks continue with a very similiar sound to their previous albums; it's an interesting mix of progressive rock (although the songs are shorter) and pop. The last track, ""Follow You, Follow Me"", is terrific, but seems separate from the rest of the album, since it's the only love song. Whether you like the Gabriel sound or the later Genesis sound, this album should suit both types."
3,The End of the Genesis Era,"This CD clearly shows the influence that both Gabriel and Hackett had on the band. After Gabriel left (post -Lamb lies down), the band was still interesting but slightly more commercial. After Hackett's departure, it was top 40 time. Don't get me wrong, I like this CD a lot but this more than any other Genesis CD shows just who the adventurous musicianship was coming from."
4,And Then There Were Three...Still Alive And Kickin',"Now that they were down to three members, most people thought that Genesis was doomed. However, this turned out to be an enjoyable album. And Then There Were Three really seems to have Tony Banks' stamp written all over it - the songs are very keyboard driven - yet you can tell Phil was making Genesis his show. This enjoyable balance really works best on Follow You, Follow Me (my favorite Phil Collins-era Genesis track), but all of the songs are worth the price of admission, especailly Down And Out, Scenes From A Night's Dream, and Many Too Many. It was very clear that Genesis were on their way to superstardom."
2,Audiophiles Beware,"The compression scourge has struck again! I was really looking forward to this remaster series coming out, but I'm totally disappointed. As with any compressed audio, it is harsh and fatiguing to listen to. The '94 remasters sound better, so there's no need to buy this unless you want the videos. Don't bother thinking about the European hybrid SACD's either because they're mastered by the same person that did this one - I know - I bought them too. The remix, on the other hand, clears up the muddiness of the previous mix, allowing you to hear things that were buried before. This could have been a revelation with less compression."
2,A couple of good songs and many boring ones,"I am a fan of Genesis, from both era, Gabriel and Collins. This album is a bit weak, the band is searching for its new identity, without success.This album is an in-between, between prog and pop.The good songs are ""Undertow"", ""Snowbound"", ""The Burning Rope"" ""Deep in the Motherlode"", and ""Many too Many""The weakest are ""Ballad of big"", ""Scene from a night dream"" which are really bad cut for a band so talented. ""Follow you follow me"" has been listened too often, I can't hear it anymore. The rest are just ok, but not memorable cuts."
3,Best Genesis Trio album,"With Hackett gone, the creativity was getting spread a little too thin. Musically, the album is a masterpiece and would be acceptable to the casual listener. It has a variety of colorful ballads: 'Ballad Of Big', 'Deep In The Motherlode', 'Little Nemo', 'The Lady Lies' but it just seems kinda empty and ""plastically routined"" with Collins singing by himself even with vocal overdubs. I give it a 4 for the effort, but a 3 for reputation from the previous albums. Two noteable presences of the album that are nothing lackluster are Banks's lush polyphonic synthesizer arrangements and Phil's drumming prowess.If you're a 70's Genesis fan, it will most likely be your last album to recommend. It does makes a good album to start with if you're not willing to take quite a plunge into the art/progressive rock scene of their earlier material, but your curiosity drives you to hear their sound before their huge pop era."
4,Three is the Charm,"Genesis enters there middle era with just Phil, Tony & Mike. This is a great album - songs, arrangements, etc. Down and Out starts the album out with a bang. There is some beautiful music in Snowbound, Undertow and Burning Rope. Epic progrock in Ballad of Big. I find a few moments of unneveness, notably in ""Say It's Alright Joe"" - not my favorite. But all in all, this is album is a great effort - one that I keep returning to as the years go by."
3,Great bonus DVD with a classic Genesis album,"And Then There Were Three (because Steve Hackett left during the mixing of the previous album) marks the real transition between ""old prog Genesis"" and ""modern pop Genesis."" It has a lot of the elements of the older style, but Phil Collins finally sounds secure in his lead vocals role and writing contributions. My favorite track is the last song, Follow You Follow Me, which previews the stylistic changes to come for this band. This reissue includes an excellent DVD featuring Three Dates With Genesis, a documentary about the 1978 European festival tour. Great stuff. And the standard Reissue Interviews provide good insight from the band themselves about the recording of the album and what was going on at the time."
3,And Then Steve Left...,"Melodic, haunting, but a bit boring, this album was definitley a drop-off from Wind and Wuthering and Trick of the Tail. Steve Hacketts absence is a major hole in this record, as Mike R. had to pickup where Steve left off. I have it on cassette, and every once in a while ill dig it out for a listen, but I try not to make it a habit. The songs are bucolic and, some might say a bit soft in places. They probably weren't ready to make this as a threesome, but i can feel the ""transition"" between the Gabriel-era prog and the Collins-80's pop here. It's okay, but im glad they rebounded with Duke and Abacab!"
5,Great devotional!!!,"This beautifully written book is perfect for use as a daily devotional. There are 31 wonderful ""stories"" (parables as the title calls them), one for every day of the month. The author pulls you in to the Cotswolds (an area in England that is breathtaking) with his charming reflections and draws a comparison to many of life's journeys -- your life, my life, everyone's."
3,Smaller than anticipated,"My fault that the accurate dimensions were hard for me to envision clearly, so it doesn't serve the purpose - to store a large exercise ball - that I had hoped."
3,May be good for some women,"If you are looking for info on Cortisol, you should read Safe Uses of Cortisol by William McK. Jefferies instead. This book mostly focuses on estrogen & progesterone and how they can cause PMS and depression in some women. It does not have in depth info about DHEA, Cortisol, Aldersterone, thyroid hormone or testosterone. Jefferies book would be better than this one for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome also."
4,Love the colors,I brought this rug because all the colors were what I needed in my room. The rug arrived true to color and earlier than estimated. The only con was the rug had several snags. I decided to keep it anyway because the shade of blue was perfect and I had been searching for a rug with this color for a while.
1,Product looked nothing like the picture,"This product looked nothing like the picture of the black DVD boxes. Instead, I received unwrapped, unbranded, clear CD cases. I thought I just received the wrong item so I had amazon send me a replacement. Returns are easy and quick, but upon receiving the replacement, it was the exact same item. I endedup returning both sets and taking a refund. They did give me a credit though in exces of the price since it was going to be a gift for Christmas, the credit permitted me to upgrade shipping on a different item at no charge.Long story short, inaccurate product but Amazon handled it we'll."
4,Useful and economical,"This tool works as it should- it adjusts to an angle, tightens to retain the angle, and helps to transfer the angle to your miter saw, table saw, etc. It could be more nicely made, but it would be silly to pay more for something that had better wood or nicer looking angle bar that worked no better- save that money to put it where it would make a difference."
4,Another Guy Ritchie?,"I caught this on Cinemax and thought it was another Guy Ritchie sequel to ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"". I was surprised that it wasn't, but no matter. It's good fun, especially not knowing what's really happening until the very end. Its plot may be implausible -- and having a kid smart enough to pull off something like this, but still only a punk car thief -- but you'll believe every twist and turn."
1,Poor quality...,"Be very careful if you really want this CD. There is way too much noise to hear the delicacies of the guitar playing. I can suggest other Titles by other artists in the same style, but with much better recording."
5,Awesome Accessory,This is the perfect product for someone who travels with portable computers. You don't have to tote around long phone cords it retracts with no jamming! Excellent travel accessory!
1,Useless - does not retract,"I agree with the previous review. This phone cord worked twice. Now, it only retracts about half way, and keeps getting worse. I'm returning it for a refund. Don't waste your time with this."
1,Phone Cord not high quality,"When I use this phone cord, the person on the other end is always saying that they can hardly hear me. Not good for business use."
1,Does not retract,Agree with the prior reviewers. I can not get it to retract any longer and that was only after 3 uses!
5,Excellent!!!,"I use the Denon unit to up-convert older DVD's for play on a 60"" SONY HDTV. It does a great job, better than the up-convert function of the SAMSUNG bluray player (which is also quite good). The picture quality is not as good as the true HD when playing a Bluray disc, but the differances are subtle and my investment in the older discs is preserved. I have been told that this unit is the ""standard"" and I can see why."
2,"Unreliable, in the shop again",I've have had mine for 9 months. Already it's been in the shop three times. And two weeks it stopped operating again. My brother had the same experience but he bought an Oppo after six months and twice in the shop (he is the smart one).Audio is good - I liked the DVD Audio quality. Picture good but not remarkable.I don't like that this is a vampire appliance. It always consumes power even when you turn it off.This unit does not play Blu-Ray.This is my third Denon - 1 receiver and 2 dvd players. In the last six years the quality is just not there. And price is way too high for what you get.I recommend you check out Oppo.Tom Morris
3,The transport is noisy,"You will hear the motor of the transport as it spins the disc if you sit too close to this DVD player. I sit about 3 to 4 feet from the player, which is on a rack and connected by long cables to the rear projector about 12 feet in front of me. During quiet parts of movies and music, I would hear the player grinding away.Most of the front-loading players these days seem to have this problem unless the builders of the player pay special attention to mechanically isolate the transport sonically so the listener does not have to hear this, what I find to be, very distracting noise. (And my other DVD player needs to go on my desk about 2 feet from my ears - and this 3910 ain't gonna be it!).That said, many audiophiles swear by the sonics of this beast - especially after a 3rd party modifies the electronics some (usually adding a tube to the output stage). All I can say is they must be sitting far, far away from it at the time."
4,Love of soundtracks,I went to see this movie b/c I love historic drama's. I loved the movie and thought the music was pretty interesting. Before reading other reviews I honestly never heard of Wagner nor had I seen the opera. I just love good soundtracks and I bought this cd b/c I thought it would be one of them.....so I obviously can't compare the music from the opera to this soundtrack.Although I found the soundtrack a little slow I think the music fits the movie very well. My only dislike is I thought the music for the big actions scenes could have been approached differently (#8 was a bit like fingernails on a chalkboard...but to each their own). All in all a very good soundtrack and I would definitely recommend.
4,Good music,"*Newsflash* This is not a Wagner opera CD, I don't know why people would expect it to be either, Wagner didn't invent the story- and of course it would be totally out of place in this film....So, as a soundtrack it is lovely music with a celtic influence .(which is more true to the story than a German composer's music)"
5,Great,This is a great soundtrack that weaves the story of Tristan and Isolde perfectly with the various scores.
4,The reviewer below doesn't know what he is talking about.,"Instead of writing to show how much I know about classical music, yet know nothing about the fact that this is a movie score, I am going to tell you that the soundtrack was quite enjoyable. It is above average and compareable to that of the Kingdom of Heaven Soundtrack if you liked that one. The music a good listen when you want to just work and have something pleasant in the background to listen to."
2,Arguing with a composer about music is like arguing with God about morals,"I can respect that the composer for the motion picture wanted to create her own musical adaptation for the epic, but it's almost ignorant to not even acknowledge Wagner in a simple thematic context. It's not to say works shouldn't be reinvented, but it's also hard to say anyone stands up in comparison to Wagner when it comes to opera. I believe it was Ad Girl that didn't know what she was talking about, considering the reviewer below her was simply making some observations for people who listen to actual music. Not people who assume all instrumentals are great works of art."
5,Do I Dust Or Vacuum First?,"When I don't feel like cleaning, and I usually don't, I get this book out and browse. Something in it will get done. Don makes it so easy and fun."
2,Oh please.,"You do NOT ""dust first"" ....this book is full of really ...obvious stuff..and much of it just plain wrong. This is clearly a case of titling a book with a question that most people think they know the answer to (and I have news for them - uh - they DO) and then ""surprising"" the reader with an apparently non-intuitive answer that goes against popular belief. And the reason given for dusting FIRST and then vacuuming is laughable and rather disgusting all at the same time. How dirty is your house if you have chunks of stuff on surfaces that you need to sweep off to hit the floor and then vacuum up? I mean really!! Dust and chunks of things/bits/pieces are entirely different things. One (the latter) is debris, and dust is not something that ""falls to the floor"" as you dust. Do not waste your money on this book. It's ridiculous."
1,A monumental failure,"If anyone has read all of the 1,000 plus pages of this book they deserve a medal.Powys' philosophy of writing is why use one word when you can use ten!Even after drastic cuts he could still produce monsters like this one.A few see Powys as a mystic, but it is a sham mysticism,heaving with overblown yearnings and posturings that lead nowhere.He has an annoying habit of inventing pseudo Dickensian names for characters, such as Crummie Geard, Tittie Petherton, Abel Twig, and Tossie Stickles.These people are as unreal and unbelievable as their silly names.He writes of matters of great interest to himself, no doubt, but they fail to interest us.This book is unreadable.Powys has produced a concoction of half baked ideas, served up in bad prose, and the result is well nigh indigestable."
1,Robertson Davies fans - beware!,"Wow - if you're determined to buy this book and haven't read a Powys yet, save a few bucks and buy a used one to see if you can stomach this stuff.I couldn't - and I'm so sorry I paid full price for this! After 200 pages - surely a fair test sample of a 1000+ page book - I hadn't found one character to root for and couldn't bear to plow through 800+ more pages with these ""people.""From Robertson Davies' glowing review in ""A Merry Heart,"" I felt like I really had to read Powys right away! I love Davies very much, but this book is nothing like his work - it's m-u-c-h slower and much less far-ranging. It's dull, dull, dull. And the characters are one-dimensional -- either they're pathetic or corrupt.Just goes to show once again that what deeply moves one person can leave someone who loves the first person cold. Maybe you had to be born in Canada to Welsh parents at the turn of the century and reading this book in the 1930s to get it. I tried, and I couldn't."
3,"Light years away from ""A trick of the tail""","The previous effort, A trick of the Tail was really a great cd and tookeveryone by surprise, including the members of the band I think.Wind and Wuthering is light years away from ""A trick of the Tail""The sound is flat, too much keyboard, not enough guitar solo.There are some great tracks, for instance ""One for the Wine"", Unquiet Slumbers for the Sleepers...In that Quiet Earth and the emotional ""Afterglow"" are amazing cuts. Eleventh earl of Mar, Your own special way, and Blood on a rooftop are good but not great.Wot Gorilla is a pale copy of Los Endos and All in the mouse's night is not far from boring."
5,INSTRUMENTAL MASTERPIECE,This album is a great mix of the old and the new. It is truly a instrumental masterpiece!
4,Almost a masterpiece,"This is the last truly great Genesis album.The album opens with one of the band's strongest songs ever, the exuberant, dynamic ""Eleventh Earl of Mar."" The last three songs are also excellent, from the elegant dramatic ballad ""Blood on the Rooftops,"" the brooding, mysterious ""Unquiet Earth,"" and the hauntingly beautiful ""Afterglow.""Unfortunately, the songs in between are flawed: ""One for the Vine"" is an epic marred by substandard composition. ""You Have Your Own Special Way"" is a sickeningly sweet foretaste of the commercial Genesis of the future. ""Wot Gorilla"" is a pointless fusion instrumental. ""All in a Mouse's Night"" is - no pun intended - a bit cheesy.But the highlights are clearly among the best Genesis songs ever. If only the band had stayed in the studio a bit long longer, ""Wind and Wuthering"" would have been a 5-star masterpiece."
5,Epic and poetic,"I remember when this first came out in vinyl in December 1976. I bought it along with The Missing Piece by Gentle Giant, and spent all afternoon progging out on both splendid records. Both epic and poetic, Wind and Wuthering is the last Genesis album with Steve Hackett on Guitar. It is in a way the last of the truly British folklore albums by Genesis, dealing with historical epochs like 11th Earl of Mar, or fantasy tales such as All in Mouse's House. The production quality on the re-master is superb, whether you play it on surround sound or a portable player. Wot Gorilla is a clever jam tune, and of course Your own Special Way was the single for this record.Blood on the Rooftops seem to be the consensus favorite of the band itself, according to recent interviews in Prog Magazine this last summer. This song is still timely today, in light of the Mid East situation.This is must own for Prog rock fans, and will appeal to devotees of fantasy and mythology as well."
3,"Sound and fury, signifying ... relatively little?","Wind and Wuthering is not that bad, really. But it's one of the two weak transitional albums between Trick of the Tail and Abacab. Wind and Wuthering attempts to be the same kind of concept-driven excursion into fantasy that Trick of the Tail was, but the edge isn't there. Nor, really, is a whole lot that's new. The album seems to get lost and dawdle a bit, especially in the longer pieces--whose lyrics are on the sappy side.Wind and Wuthering is a decent musical effort, but it comes up on my ""Genesis play list"" very infrequently. I'm not saying you shouldn't own it. For fans of traditional Genesis, it beats the heck out of the latest whatever it is that they're doing now."
3,The beginning of the end,"Wind & Wuthering was the 2nd album of Genesis' middle period (1976-1978) and it featured two bad commercial pop balleds Your Own Special Way and Afterglow and 2 ok half pop and half prog songs All In A Mouses Night and Blood On The RoofTops and these bog it down from greatness. On the plus side Tony Banks further expands his palate of keyboards, Steve Hackett provides some nice kalimba playing and Phil uses the cymbals to good effect. Songs like Eleventh Earl Of Mar (featuring Steves kalimba) and Wot Gorrila (featuring Phils cymbals) are amazing. As are the other 3 highlights Unquiet Slumbers For The Sleepers, In That Quiet Earth and One For The Vine but with Afterglow and Your Own Special Way this was clearly the beggining of the end end for Genesis as a quality band."
2,too quiet,"Simply- the sound is bad. OK there are some good songs, but all in all previous albums are much better."
1,Genesis At Their Worst,"This is the one Genesis record I can't listen to. The production is flat and lifeless, the tunes boring. The desolate looking gray and brown of the cover art sums up perfectly what's inside. Only ""All In A Mouse's Night"" comes close to what you would expect after the brilliant ""Trick Of The Tail"". Pass on this one."
1,weakest 70s effort,"This album sounds uninspired, has long boring songs on it and even the band itself must have not liked it that much since only ""afterglow"", appeared on the next release, the live ""Seconds Out"" (which includes 4 tracks from the previous release ""Trick of the Tail"", to prove that point) Phil Collins when through an emotional low at the time of this recording and it shows, he is squeezing out Banks' out-of-this-world lyrics as if he has just ran a marathon. Most of all near the end of the 70s Genesis decided to follow up on classic ""Trick of the Tail"" with a forced more prog-rock sound (we can do it without Gabriel! ) and fails miserably. While other bands try to freshen up their sound in the era of disco, punk, the police, blondie among others, genesis decided to put out an album that makes Pink Floyd's Animals(1978)sound uplifting!Fastforward to ""Duke"""
1,Think of your own W's...,"I have to fall in with the negative reviews on this one. I remember when this album came out when I was in colege. My roommates and I were Gabriel-era Genesis fans that were quite pleased with Trick of the Tail--then this sappy, limp-wristed followup came out. We had a game of making up alternative titles for this album--Weak and Worthless, Wimpy and Withering...you get the picture. ""Your Own Special Way"" was particularly ghastly. For wusses only."
3,Too soft,"Songs on this album show great potential, ""11th earl of mar"" and ""blood on the rooftops"" are very good songs, but production-wise nothing is done to beef it up a little. Phil Collins' voice is too soft and lacks a hard edge, which is also not provided by the music, the drums sound soft too. (Compare this ""One for the vine"" with the three sides live version) Although I like the album, it kinda whines at times (""Your own special way"" in particular)"
4,The last great Genesis Record,"This is truly the last great Genesis record. Except for the live Seconds Out record, this is guitarist Steve Hackett's last gasp in a band that was going from interesting & creative to pop superstars. Play 'Blood on the Rooftops' followed by 'Follow you, follow me"" (And then there were three) and I think you'll agree.This record is the last one to feature the interwoven magic of Hackett's guitar and Bank's keyboards. A GEM!"
5,High water mark,"This was Genesis' high water mark. This is the last album with Steve Hackett on guitar. when Steve left, he took a certain ethereal quality with him that the band has missed ever since. The music here is intense and intricate with long instrumental passages in most of the songs. If you haven't heard this album and you like this band, get it. It's all Genesis and then some."
4,bath soap,I got tired of the small curved bars of Dial available in stores now and ordered the 4.5 oz through Amazon. The shipping charges added to the cost of the product make it expensive but I was willing to pay it to get the larger bars of Dial. I have used only Dial for many many years so changing brands was not an option for me. I use only the gold Dial because the other colors have offensive perfumes added. This is my story of personal preference.
5,Thought-provoking and inspirational,"If only we ""sighted"" people could see as well as Kathleen O'Donnell! She has written a rich treasury of thought-provoking and inspirational poetry from a deep heart and a stunning memory. The reader can ""see"" the majesty and grandeur of the Rocky Mountains, the timeless beauty of the changing seasons, and the vastness of the heavens, all through the brushstrokes of finely chosen words. From the fragrance of apples in autumn to the singing of crickets on a warm summer night, her poetry creates vivid images that transport the reader to a comforting place, far from the frantic chaos of our day and age. And to think that all this was given to us by one who will never see her own work in print! I hope that I never see the world the same, through dull eyes that grow weary by the things that should forever capture my attention, my appreciation, my soul."
5,The new edition is excellent,"I have no experience with the previous edition, and until now I only used the Lonely Planet on Morocco, but I did some tests on issues I had found missing in the Lonely Planet and the new Rough Guide passed the test excellently.For instance the Lonely Planet had hardly anything on the nice road between Taroudant and Ouerzazate, in between two Atlasses, so almost fully skipping saffron paradise Taliouine and carpetters paradise Tazenaght, while the Rough Guide does not assume you will pass that road through Marrakch, which requires crossing the High Atlas twice.And even on the road from West to East behind the Anti-Atlas through Tissint etc. the Rough Guide has a feature.It is more weighty than the Lonely Planet, but that is because it has more information, and that is what one eventually needs.Neil in Amsterdam"
2,Unfulfilling,"As we loaded our backpacks hours before our jet departed Vancouver, my partner and I debated about whether to bring Lonely Planet's Morocco guidebook, or the Rough Guide. In the end, mostly due to weight considerations, we left the Rough Guide at home. I would advise any first-time traveller to Morocco to do the same. It's a tired, rambling, incomplete guide, full of inconsequential information and generic descriptions. Hotel prices, strangely, are not listed. There is scant reference to Morocco's massive social ills. And there are too many references to writer Paul Bowles, who, I admit, is the be-all-and-end-all of western Moroccan ex-pats. But enough about him, already. Lonely Planet gets all the promotion it needs from other reviewers, so I was hesitant in writing this review. But for those looking for a more concise, insider view of Morocco, LP's the way to go."
2,Bad BAD mix,"Whoever mixed the original tapes for this album is an idiot. The reason to listen to ANL--and the thing that makes them great--is the vocals/lyrics, and these are buried as deep down as you can get. Plenty of obnoxious drums and guitar ""in your face""--who needs it? Is this some Gen-Yer's idea of what ""punk"" was supposed to be all about? Animal is far off in the wings shouting into a mic and you can't hear a thing he says. And he HAS something to say (which is why the 2-star rating, not the 1). Good luck! Frustrating (and insulting), to say the least. Don't waste your money. You won't listen to it. Only for collectors."
4,Interesting,"I enjoyed this film although it was not as hard hitting as I expected. It presents a balanced view of the use of subliminal messages by those who desire to influence our thoughts, habits, and actions."
5,A great overview!,This movie will show you how our modern exposure to marketing everywhere we look has death grip on our lives. Not a great movie for children to see
2,Nothing We Haven't Heard Before,"I looked over this book for about an hour while at a bookstore recently and was not all that impressed with it. There are some helpful hints but nothing I hadn't already seen in the Chic Simple's Women's Wardrobe. It is a good overall guide if you don't already own any of these kind of books but if you do, you could probably save your money and stick to what you've got. Women's Wardrobe may be a little outdated but I believe it is a better organized book.Also, it would be nice if some of these books also addressed woman who have multiple problem areas. Sometimes the tips given for one area contradict those given for another area."
2,Secrets of Perpetuating Self-Hatred,"Like most women's magazines, this InStyle book makes the twisted assumption that all women hate the way they look and must ""camouflage"" their countless flaws. Its persistent notion that anxiety is our key motivating force is, in a word, depressing.As well, in an effort to be a comprehensive primer, it tends to be patronizing and ridiculous. We KNOW what a turtleneck is, thanks.I was amused to see the rave review here from ""Tracy Lawton"" who is obviously related to InStyle's editor, Charla Lawton.Disappointing."
2,Who CARES what celebs look good in?,"If I looked like Halle Berry I wouldn't need a guide like this one. This book is so full of posed photos of celebrities looking wonderful in their size-2 clothing that it doesn't have enough room to help me figure out how to camoflage my less-than-perfect derriere. The focus is SO heavy on the celebrities -- not nearly enough time is spent on what to do when you have two figure flaws that work at cross-purposes to one another. For instance, I'm short and small-busted. Short women are advised to avoid double-breasted styles...but small-busted women are advised to go for double-breasted. There's not much in this book about how to solve these sorts of issues. Instead of showing me Nicole Kidman in a $10,000 suit, why not show me a woman with a figure problem in side-by-side photos showing clothing that enhances her positives and hides her flaws and clothing that doesn't?"
2,Not really helpful,"It's easy to be impressed by all the gorgeous outfits they've put together, but I found this book short on helpful advice on how to do this oneself. I was hoping for more basic suggestions for what shapes and styles look good together.And some of their advice about ""must-have"" basics just isn't universally applicable. Half of their ""6 figure-flattering classics no closet should be without"" are not great. As a curvy woman with tendency towards pear-shape, I have yet to find straight-leg pants than don't make my legs look like tree trunks; I do much better with bootcut. A straight-cut turtleneck? Completely hides my waist and makes me look boxy. And flesh-colored pump? Yuck: double yuck. How about you show us *one single example* of an outfit in this entire book with flesh-colored pumps, and then I'll agree that this is an important basic.So after buying and reading this book, I feel like I wasted my money. I didn't learn anything I didn't already know from reading fashion magazines"
5,Impressive array of model business plans to adapt,"With more than 60 model business plans to choose from, the reader can readily draw up their own, made easier by the accompanying CD-ROM. The sample plans include retailers, small service firms, small manufacturers,home-based enterprises, research organizations, educational institutions, franchises, nonprofits, importers/exporters, and others. The book also contains an extensive collection of small business resources such as SBDC lists and Internet search results."
5,Perfect Oatmeal in the Morning,This automatic rice cooker has been great. I set it up almost every night using the time delay function to have my oatmeal ready in the morning. I use 1C of steel cut oats to 3 cups of water using the brown rice setting. Perfect oatmeal every time. It also worked great for both white and brown rice.
5,Completely Satisfied.,"I have had only good experiences so far with this rice cooker. It hasn't burned the rice at the bottom, it is easy to clean, and isn't too big so it isn't in the way too much on the kitchen counter."
2,annoying clicking sound and rice is no good after a few hours,"I bought this less expensive model after reading reviews that it was ""just as good as the Zojirushi."" When the rice cooker is on, it makes a clicking sounds every few seconds. Not loud, just enough to be annoying. I always know when my rice cooker is on. Better brands can keep rice warm with spoiling, scorching, or drying out the rice. Not this one."
4,Good rice cooker for the price.,"Very nice rice cooker, easy to use and clean. The white rice it cooked was very good. But I am kind of disappointed that I couldn't set delay timer to cook porridge. Otherwise I am happy with it."
1,This is a six cup rice cooker in disguise...,"We thought we were getting a great deal on a 12 cup rice cooker, but read the description carefully. It makes up to 12 cups of rice from 6 cups. All rice cookers other than Aroma list the size based on the amount of uncooked rice you can put in the cooker.We have a 4 year old ten cup Aroma and it clearly says it is a 10 cup right on the machine. And it takes ten cups of uncooked rice.To add insult to injury, the company says it is a 6 cup rice cooker on the manual INSIDE the box.Don't buy this until you see it. It is about half the size of our current rice cooker."
1,Incorrect description,"Amazon advertises this as a 12 cup rice cooker but the inner pot is only marked as a 6 cup. They said they go by the manufacturers data and that they would edit the description to reflect the inner pots measure but they have not. I sent it back. I was also promised a $20.00 credit to my account for my troubles but have yet to see it. In all fairness, this was my first bad experience with Amazon."
1,Nerf meets destructo boy,"I bought this toy for my brother who is Autistic becasue it came HIGHLY recomended. It's a good concept, a ball that can stack and has a smaller ball that can be placed within in it. Good, simple fun for much younger kids. Small problem; it's made out of nerf like material so lasts about five seconds. So, the kids can't play with it becasue it's destroyed."
3,Not worth the money.....,"I thought this toy looked cool from the beginning. It's neat that it can stack and the little ball pulls out from the big one. It is a weird foam material and has no bounce to it. It's a bit smaller than I realized, probably a bit smaller than a regular grocery store bouncy ball. My children have not destroyed their balls, yet. Only my 15 month old is interested in this toy and she does enjoy pulling the smaller ball out. The 4 year old was fairly underwhelmed. You also pretty much have to get 2 to enjoy the stacking effect and then you can mix and match the smaller balls. All in all it was not really worth the price at the $14 I paid for it. I reconsidered...after a few months use one of the inner balls is falling apart. I emailed the company a week ago about this issue and have not heard back. It is outrageous that an expensive ball would fall apart so quickly with minimal play."
3,way overpriced for what it is,"it's just a ball. my son enjoys any kind of ball and you can find one ranging from $1.00 to $100. well this one is designer ball and the price is higher, so if you want to impress your friends you can buy one for their child as a special gift.from the practical point, it's not ment to be used outdoors, because it damages very easily. it's made from some polymer foam that is very soft and a child can easily bite off chunks. it's not attended for children under 2."
5,important,"A very important book for understanding the current debates about the nature of consciousness. W distinguishes between being certain of something because it is certainly true, and being certain of something because nothing would make sense without it.Very readable, for W."
3,Honest but thin,"This work captures some of Wittgenstein's last thoughts. If you are a student of this philosopher's work this is a msut have, I believe. However, it depends on earlier concepts to be understood, especially those found in ""Philosophical Investigations"". It is a very small book, with almost no commentary besides the origins of the original manuscripts, that Wittgenstein never published. If you are interested in the base text, without any commentary, this is for you. The fact that the original German text is given besides the english translation is also nice, because Wittgenstein's thoughts can easilt be misunderstood if translated badly."
3,Not bad but I wonder about durability,"Was surprised that this backboard is made entirely of plastic! It is very light weight. My existing brackets connected right up to the holes, but the screws were sunk into the plastic supports on the rear of the backboard. I'm really questioning how long it will take for those screws to become un-threaded. The rim is identical to the one I bought 13 years ago. Not entirely sold on the slam-it rim, especially with what I've said above re: plastic connections.Not a bad purchase for kids, but I can't believe I will get anywhere near the 13 years I got from my previous Lifetime backboard!!"
5,replacement back board,Nice replacement board but you have to make sure it is a lifetime pole or you will have to get a adapter for it. I did not have to do anything like that and was able to use some of the hardware off my old one including the mounting hardware that came with it and I had it installed in approx 1 hr.
2,Feels flimsy,"This backboard feels flimsy. It looks ok, appears to be well-made, etc; it just has a lot of flex to it.As a result, when the B-ball hits the backboard, the backboard flexes and this results in an unpredictable rebound.I mounted it to a brick wall using Lifetime's universal mounting kit and 5/16"" Red-Head masonry anchor bolts. It's not the mount that's the problem, it's the back-board itself.Don't get me wrong, it's not a terrible product for the money. But if you can afford something better, and basketball really matters to you, you can do better."
2,Nice But....,Kit arrived in good packaging. I also ordered the mounting kit.The hoop and backboard kit was missing a pair of grommets and springs for the lower bolts to the hoop.There were no directions included with the hoop and backboard kit.I believe the quality of the parts supplied was good but not all the parts were included.
1,just a cheap backboard,save up for something of better quality. plastic housing around plexiglass is not going to hold up. was shipped the next day if ya live in the phoenix area was the only plus
2,Price was phenominal,Price was good. I didnt even mind the previous owners notes. Un fortunately this version of the book was missing several key elements I needed for class study. I wouldnt recommend this version to anyone. Sorry!
3,A Little Disappointed...,"I am surprised to see such positive reviews of this book. While the historical element of the text was enjoyable, I felt that the book was heavily weighted to support a certain opinion. While I typically consider myself and Independent I got a little tired of the liberal rhetoric that appeared again and again in every into. In addition, I do not feel that the articles were chosen to represent what was actually occuring during the 60's but rather to paint a very deliberate picture. To portray the U.S. as being so black or white (good guys and bad guys) is a disapointment and it ignores the complexity of us as individuals. My biggest complaint is the portrayal of the Vietnam War and veterans in general. To ignore the soldiers who fought believing in a ""nobel cause"" is an injustice.Again, I do not support either side but feel that this is a misrepresentation as a whole...I hope that if you do read this book that it is not the only one that you read on the sixties."
1,Health Hazard,Do not purchase this product unless given specific instructions from a physician. This supplement exceeds the upper limit of the daily recommended intake for zinc and therefore could potentially cause health problems if taken for a sustained period of time.
5,Terry Pratchett is awesome!,"This book is amazing as it brings about a great many comments about society! Terry Pratchett is the best social commentator and critic of this decade! He writes about socially controversial issues in a way that both separates is from the real - thus allowing the reader to look at it in an objective view AND brings it so close to the bone that you cannot avoid but see his meaning. It is amazing. The characters of this novel are awesome, and the issues that are dealt with are interesting and it is written in a way that is fast, entertaining and just crazy =) awesome and worthy read."
4,A great light read for fantasy lovers,"As far as vampire parodies go, you could do better. But you could certainly do worse.Pratchett isn't at his funniest here, but the read is entertaining, insightful and jaunty; a 'good' reader should be able to get through it in a few days worth of casual reading. It has some religious themes in it that manage to be insightful without being offensive, and the book ends cheerfully. I think that might be it's key flaw: It almost ends TOO cheerfully, as if none of the conflicts ended badly for anyone. I mean, even the characters who die don't have it bad.At any rate, it manages to be a more relevant vampire novel than 'Twilight.'"
2,Not his Best,Terry is probably the funniest author alive but this work is nothis triumphs.Quite frankly it often came over more like Chelsea Quinn Yarbrothan vintage Pratchett. In the first half of the book I couldnot tell any difference between what was written and a standardfantasy. By the time the comedy overcame the tripe this bookwas ruined for me. What a shame.
3,One of the weaker Discworld books,"The villains are a family of vampires, who move in and take over Lancre and its royal family, while Granny Weatherwax and the other witches try to stop them (and eventually succeed, of course). As my wife says, it just seems like a rehash of Lords and Ladies."
4,Cover Art,I'm sorry to say that having realised that the cover art on the US released Pratchett books are not the classic Josh Kirby stuff I'm used to. I will have to buy my Pratchett books here in Australia to keep my colletion looking uniform.
4,The WeatherWax Waxes and Wanes,"This is another Granny Weatherwax book, but in fact she shows some human failings in this one, which is startling, and is nearly turned to the dark side. There are, of course, only a few puns per paragraph, and the whole book is as entertaining as always.But there was a bit of a serious thread here, or seemed to be, that startled me. That's not negative, it just is."
5,Cool,"I have just finished this book - it is a return to form for the witches after the disappointment of Maskerade. It is certainly better than Pratchett's new book ""The Fifth Elephant"", which is about the dullest I have read.Just one question though - what is Kirkus going on about above? This book is the Australian one? - I thought The Last Continent was the spoof of Australia. Does Kirkus actually read the books - or do they just read the back cover?"
5,"Ace stuff as ever - in the Pratchett ""vein""!",Any of the witches books seem to be a hit for me - Pratchett's skilled use of metaphor and his wicked insights in the contemporary world are woven into a rich tapestry of fun filled fancy! Loved the allegory* relating to sacrifice that was played out by Granny Weatherwax.* Al. E. Gory was once a politician but decided to give it up in favour of a more honest profession as a forger! He wrote stories with optional insight..
5,Very fun--even surprisingly so,"[For context's sake, I have been reading the Discworld books in publication order. Carpe Jugulum is #23.]I'm not sure that the book was cohesive enough throughout to warrant a five-star rating, but it was so enjoyable that I can't help myself. It was a nice surprise to learn that the Nac Mac Feegle make an early appearance here; I hadn't known or expected that. Pratchett did keep ahead of me twist-wise a few times, which is always fun. Everything was convoluted but not overly so, the plot moved along well for the most part, and the humor was great as always. Nanny Ogg was a bit more restrained in the humor department than in some past books, but that ultimately didn't detract from anything."
4,"Witches vs. Vampires -- not a chance, with Granny involved","Pratchett takes the wonderful whimsy of his famous Discworld and mixes it with a dash of nasty horror. This time out Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg and the other witches of their coven must protect their homeland of Lancre from an incursion by a clan of vampires who have been training themselves to be immune to such things as garlic and religious icons (it's all psychosomatic, you see). Pratchett, as always, is brilliantly funny and biting with his satire. No target is safe. As the title of the book implies, Pratchett's motto seems to be ""carpe jugulum... go for the throat.""I must admit, as far as the series-within-a-series Discworld books go, it took time for me to warm up to Granny Weatherwax. She and her coven have become some of my favorites among Pratchett's creations, though, and this book was perhaps their best outing yet."
4,A great plot with a little too much talking in it,"This book is a MUST for all who love Pratchett and/or vampires, especially for those who loved the philosophical talking in Small Gods. If you ask me, maybe just a little too much philosophical talking as Granny and Mightily Oats the Omnian Priest hasten though the mountains, but the Vampire's are lovely: Meet young Vlad and forget you ever dreamt of Lestrade ... Lestat ... whatever his name may have been, he doesn't matter any more. These are simply the best vampires I've ever met, and I must know, since I am one myself (well, at least part-time)."
5,Very good product,"These envelopes are a little longer than I thought I was ordering but they are the same very light, good quality product that I expect from Jiffylite mailers at the best price I found on the internet."
5,Interesting and revealing of the man,"The book is well done and Hitler's work from sketches to oil painting is much better than I had expected. Most interesting is his paintings of great old buildings. This book certainly shatters the myth that Hitler was a terrible artist and the crude distortion that he was a ""house painter."""
2,Only a two star,"It was interesting how her relationship with Edward developed in their letters. It was great to see her encourage him through this forum. And it was interesting to see the morsals of advise given throughout the novel.However, I fail to see how this novel was nominated for awards. It failed to maintain my interest, and I doubt it would be interesting to children."
4,"Love from your Friend, Hannah","I liked how Hannah wrote to President Roosevelt because it sounds exciting to write to the president. But, I did not like the bad words because I thought she would get in trouble.Hannah learned to be patient with her family and friends. For example, she thought Edward would be mean in the beginning of the book. Hannah found out Edward was not really mean, he was nice.I learned about the 1930's. President Roosevelt was nice to everybody. I would have voted for President Roosevelt."
3,What does this mean?,"This is a good book because she is telling about her life when she gets in trouble. This could really happen! How many of us would like to have the pen pals that she had? I am stuck on a word from the book on page 162. What does ""chinik"" mean?"
5,A Really Cool Girl,"Hannah, the main charictar of the book, writes tons of letters. Her best friend, Aggie, just moved away and promised to write even though she thought Hannah would forget to write back. It turns out that Aggie is the on who forgets to write to Hannah. Hannah starts to write to a young boy named Edward, from Kanses. Hannah writes to a ton of other people including the presdent of the U.S.A.!My favorite part was when the presadent actually wrote back! I won't tell you the end though"
3,"A good storyline, but not the best...","This was a good foray into the world of Dick Grayson's crime fighting, but not the best I've seen. Some of the characterization seems off and the story is a little uninteresting but overall it is passable. The art is average, better than some but far from the best. Overall this book left me wanting more out of it but not utterly unsatisfied. For a great Dick Grayson as Batman storyline see Batman and Robin by Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely. Quitely doesn't do the whole run, only the first 6 or 7 issues, but he continues with the cover art and the artist who takes over is great too."
4,"Interesting, but somewhat pointless","This book is sort of a companion to the new Batman & Robin series. Both of them have Dick Grayson who use to be Nightwing trying to fit the role of becoming the new Batman. However he must change everything about himself from small things like his clothes, to his attitude and fighting style. Of course other villains have gotten suspicious of the new outgoing Batman and wonder if its the same man behind the mask.While I find this book entertaining its pretty pointless because DC is rushing out the return of Bruce Wayne because they were late on the ball with the death and resurrection of Captain America. Seeing a story like this makes me want the return of Bruce Wayne to be delayed because this is a fun story."
2,Disappointed,"If you want to learn english, buy this book. It had far too much english in it in the practice exercise and not enough clear explanation of the more complicated verb tenses and when and where they are used."
2,"great exercises, terrible index","this book, part of a series for several languages, is probably my least favorite: the verb index at the back is in english, so there is no way to quickly look up verbs in spanish. one has to know the english translation, and then what's the point? the exercises are thorough, but someone desparately needs to add spanish to the english verb index (the index works this way: to make... hacer; however, there is no entry for hacer, so if you want to look up hacer you can't -- you have to know it means to make)."
2,Treats verb conjugations too much like multiplication tables.,"I knew it had some mistakes, but I didn't realize how many until I saw that other review, so I knocked my review down a star. I used exercises from the book to test my 2nd year Spanish students. I don't recommend it for trying to learn Spanish. It is far too decontextualized. I realize the title is, Spanish Verb ""Drills"" but I need more context in order for the verb tenses to make sense."
1,Too scary for children...,"This book should come with a warning label -- may be too scary for children. The graphic information about shark attacks is just too much for children under 10, unless you want to encourage nightmares and fear of the water. Parents -- carefully preview this book before presenting it to your children. Even though it is very appealing for the young, it may be too much information for the targeted age group."
2,loved NZ...not the book,This book was somewhat helpful during my time in NZ.The town/street maps were helpful in navigating--large enough to cover most of the city while still being readable.The reviews were less than accurate. Most of the restuarants I tried to go to from this book were closed (I understand places close...but the majority of them???). The few restuarants that I found still open were drastically different than the reviews. I wonder if the authors/contributers had been to NZ! One of the places that I stayed at (highly recommended in the book) was sooo horrible that I felt unsafe and cancelled the rest of my stay there.I was lucky to be travelling with people who had other books on NZ.
3,Good Story -- Bad Acting,"I liked the story line, but hated some of the acting. The daughter was just too bubbly, too sweet, and totally unbelievable. The actress that played Helen Morrison was even worse. In one scene when Stella is telling Helen her plan for the daughter, Helen just stares at her making weird faces and grasping her strangely. If it hadn't been so disturbing, it would have been hilarious. On the other hand Stanwyck gave an excellent performance as well as Alan Hale."
5,STANWYCK'S GREATEST PERFORMANCE!,"Barbara Stanwyck never gave a bad performance. She was consistently good in everything she did. But this performance tops all the rest! Her Stella tears the heart out of you...she gets on your nerves, yes, but the love she shows for her daughter is genuine and Stanwyck shows all the multifaceted dimensions of this character. She truly shines in every scene, particularly the final fadeout! She deserved the Oscar nomination she received for this and she should have won. The DVD is remastered beautifully, both picture and sound. Unfortunately, no extras are included. But Stanwyck alone is worth it. Equally fine is Anne Shirley as Laurel, her daughter. John Boles is a milquetoast character who does what he can as Stephen Dallas. No wonder Stella finds him a bore. Enjoy this one folks because they truly don't make them like this anymore! And they never will again!"
4,Nice but not the best,"The movie itself is the best,,,Barbara is awesome but the quality of the movie is not the best..Otherwise I love it."
4,Mother in-law was ecstatic!,"Wife said she had fond memories watching this movie with her mother! She only had a VHS version, so she was very happy to upgrade it to a DVD."
4,Photos galore,"There are photos on almost every page, but they aren't as varied as I had hoped. Photos are sized well, but many of them lack contrast. Text is mostly limited to captions of the photos. I wanted to learn a lot more about this extraordinary wooden plane, but this book wasn't too helpful in that respect. I had expected to give it five stars, but I have to give it four now that I've received it. (And maybe that's being too generous.)"
3,Strings & Scales,"I'm an Adult Student and very interested in Beginning Cello Instruction books. If you don't know how to read music well - I found this book to be very helpful in explaining obscure things needed to read music. Other nicities the symbol for up bow and down, learning rests, etc. No book is as good as a teacher but this helps compliment them. It includes all those minutia but crucial points they seem to cram in a lesson and in the beginning we seem to forget."
2,Bueno,"Es un buen libro pero no comparto el hecho de enseñarles a los chicos a tocar números en vez de notas en un pentagrama. Justamente cuando tienen todo un mundo desestructurado por delante, enseñar números de dedos no me parece correcto. Hace tocar melodías totalmente escritas con números, sin figuras."
2,Don't waste your money -- Good songs drowned out by shrieking fans,"If you want to feel thoroughly cheated, buy this album. Why didn't they edit out the screaming girls?? This live concert album couldn't appeal to anyone except those who attended the concert and want a memory of the event. Bruel sings his most popular songs, which are indeed lovely, but he's frequently drowned out by his screaming fans, who sound like a bunch of hysterical high school girls. Don't bother with this one. Collect these songs from other (studio) albums instead."
4,Views from ordinary lives,"The book contains three stories, all set in Vienna. The third story is about the strange love pact of a painter and his model in the past and another strange pact (but not really a love pact this time) of another painter and her model at present. Although the first two stories do not tell us such an interesting, disturbing and misterious tale like the third one, Steven Kelly's use of the language makes it a pleasure to read.All the heroes (if that would be the word...) are just ordinary people with nothing very special about them. On the other hand, they all have interesting personalities with their own obsessions and fears, and the author's easy-going way of telling the story makes you feel like you are among them and living through their lives."
2,Sitting Bull,I made this purchase hoping I would be invited to Indian lunches but I haven't got past the hot water part.
1,"No need for forks when using a ""forked tongue""",The chili that was listed by Lizzie Warren gave me heartburn that was about as intense as the burning the liberals and Mass must feel in their soulless pits for nominating her. Nothing is more delicious than seeing a liberal hoisted on her own petard....yummy.
5,5/32 American Indian,"I drove a Jeep Cherokee through a Creek in Seminol Fla. while on my way to visit Choctaw to see my friend who is Chickasaw. Pow Wow!!! I got them all in in one sentence. That makes me 5/32 of Civilized American Indian. POW WOW!!!Now freed from the bondage of my WASP upbringing I will be able to write my own Indian cookbook, coloring books and survival guide for progressive liberals lost in their own mind.Lizzy you saved me from a life of believing I was just an old fat white guy.Now I can be anything I want...to dream the impossible dream...Do try this book...the recipes for eating crow are excellent!Muzz"
1,Pow Wow Chow,Seems that all the recipes by Lizzie Warren call for a bunch of baloney !Q: Why was Warren refused a room at the Marriott ?A: She couldn't prove she had a reservation.
3,Suggested revision,"This recipe book should be revised for the modern day Occupy protester. After all, the self proclaimed ""Intellectual Foundation"" for the Occupy movement is a major contributor. They should be easy, simple yet filling after a long day of disrupting businesses, bodily functions on police cars, throwing rocks through windows, finding a camera and demanding that some unknown 1% pay for your student loan. This can be tiresome ""work"".Perhaps the publishing company could see the results of these revised recipes when the well fed crowd is smashing in their front window."
1,Worried my cheekbones won't grow,I'm on the fence about buying this book. Will it change my anatomy for better academic and career paths? Books about beer drinking have done the former but not the latter.
1,Sux-ahontus recipes,"OMG, this is great! I myself am an ""Indian outlaw, half Cherokee and Choctaw. My baby, she's a Chippawa, she's one of a kind"". I was never asked to write a recipe in this book."
1,You Make Me Dizzy Miss Lizzy!,"Lizzie warden made a lie,Beat out every teaching guy,Then roused up the Occupy,Now it's time she said goodbye."
3,Would like to read more but,I was given this as a gift by a Massachusetts politician but then it was taken back. I suspect in a perverse and ignorant attempt at proving her Indian ancestry.
1,She stole the recipes,"Paarently, they are not even her own recipes. She actually seems to have plagiarized them...gee, a noted scholar from Harvard plagiarizing stuff? nah..[...]"
2,"OK, but not traditional","No doubt, there are some tasty recipes in this book, but I bought it originally because I was interested in Native American cuisine. Perhaps it shouldn't suprise us that a book published by the ""Five Civilized Tribes"" would have such minimal connection to traditional cooking. Many of the recipes call for cream cheese, graham crackers, velveeta, mayonnaise, etc. But otherwise the recipes are tasty, I admit."
2,Disappointed...,I expected to at least have some wine pairings. Very disappointing to have recipes that don't rise to proper sophistication.
2,My cheekbones got higher . . .,". . . after I began to cook with the recipes from this book. Funny, though--that crabmeat/mayo recipe? Almost like I had seen it before."
3,An Authentic Slice of Native American Lifestyle,"I find that cooking these recipes over an open backyard campfire while wearing the Three Wolf Moon T-shirt (also sold here on Amazon!) really helps me to better understand the tragedy of Native American Experience. Plus, that Cochise Crème Brlée is yummy! When my pissed off neighbors tossed a smallpox blanket over the fence (because of the smoke and maybe the tom-tom, I guess) a tear rolled slowly down my cheek and I looked up toward the Great God of the Sky. I felt just like Iron Eyes Cody when he sees a litterbug."
3,Could be better,"I bought this book to try out some of new food. I was somewhat disappointed in the some of the recipes. Not as good as the cookbook, ""1001 Ways to Wok Your Dog"" by a Harvard graduate, but hey I get to meet Indians with this book."
3,reasonably enjoyable groove confectionary,"Five years of jacked up fireside funk from the tart little Tummy Touch label, all for five pounds (about nine bucks to us folks here). Can't beat that deal, hmm?Possibly not. Tim `Love' Lee waves the banner for sauced-up soul tunes that deftly veer from the smirking cloy puddles most other artists would step into. The smoothly stitched drum loops of `Again Son' and southern fried trip hop of `Go Down Dixie' rise above out-in-leftfield novelty value for surefire keepers. Tutto Matto `Take My Hand,' all horn stabs and falsetto croon, perhaps best exemplifies the label's designs, while Los Chicharrons `Chicharrons n Boogaloo' is pure party frippery waiting for a beer ad.The rest of the bag tend to rely on attitude and DIY cut & paste aesthetic rather than crafting lasting music. Reasonably enjoyable...perhaps an album can indeed just get by as groove confectionery."
1,Beware - This book is not what it says it is...,"There are no 'plans' included - this is merely a compendium of cool house ideas and sketches, that's all. If you want a cute coffee table book, sure - this will do.Useful info like dimensions and design notes? Look elsewhere, like in the Lowes book:Lowe's Home Plans Distinguished Small Homes (Plans from the Lowe's legacy series). It was cheap and has real, usable info."
1,GLASSES PLEASE,The type and drawings in this book are so small you need a magnifying glass to read it. This book might be more suited to the classroom.
3,Small House Designs,The book is interesting but the illustrations are somewhat difficult tovisualize and understand.
2,The cover fools you,Be warned. This book contains only 2D home plans. Their are no photos besides the one on the cover.
2,Colors please,"When I buy a book I either want to learn or relax. In this case I wanted to learn and had to really concentrate because of the lack of pictures in it. Great plans, great book but the lack of pictures makes it difficult to read."
4,Small House Design,"I am pleased with the contents of this book. It was purchased as a gift for a grandson, who will soon receive it. I hope he enjoys it and will put some of the information to good use."
2,Short on information and poor layout,"The layout looks as if the home plans themselves were photocopied from elsewhere, often too small and without accompanying information about materials, why and how certain layouts work in the context, labels, etc; thus even as a catalogue of disparate houses that happen to win an architectural contest, this is not very useful. Further, despite being plans of 1250 sq ft or less, there was little in the way of explanation of how this space is designed to accomodate living. Because of the topic, I expected to see a variety of houses designed to fit various contexts (urban, rural, etc) and living situations within the 1250 sq ft. I'm sure there are better books out there on this topic; not being an architect I don't know if this book would be useful to help brainstorming ideas or whatnot."
2,Not even nice pictures,"A compilation of few interesting ideas and very hard to see illustrations. Poor quality reproductions. No measurements at all. Furthermore the contact information in the back was not cross-referenced with the designs & listed no phone or web contact, just mailing addresses. Seems like the authors took the cheap and easy way out with a good idea.Taunton Press's ""The Cabin"" is a much more inspiring & informational book.I do not recommend this book."
4,"good book, needs overall measurements","good book, needs overall measurements in diagrams, square footage of first floor not always easy to determine"
2,Should have had known better,"I'm in one of the top universities in the US. Thus, the pressure from school made me want to get it. This product just gave me massive headaches, and I would keep focusing on things that I shouldn't."
1,Cruddy Guitar,"This thing is cheap. I was hoping for a good quality in a small guitar for kids. All strings had to be changed, and then the tuners were not holding the new strings tight enough, the tuners were just spinning. Almost every guitar I broke is not right in some way (I gave 6 for Christmas) It doesn't hold a tune at all. Real bummer of a purchase."
3,Nicer if made in US,The belt is fine but I am concerned about the quantity of products coming from China. Will the US become the country with no ability to manufacture anything? I happen to have a buckle that I found for this belt that has 'made in USA' stamped on it and I use it.
3,Not bad.,"I bought this item last yr for my wife for christmas. She loves the floor mates, but they are not as good as the rubber mates. Carpet mates are hard to keep clean in a nice car. Rubber you just take out and wash. Next time I will spend alil more on the rubber just cause they are more durable and easy to clean."
4,REFRESHING AND WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!,"Spike has got it going on with her strong, soulfull voice and infectious beats. It really gets under your skin and you can feel her right there with you, commanding you, ""Talkin' about that deeper love!!"" Spike, if you're out there, you're the bomb, baby!"
5,This is the best bat series,"This set will introduce Batgirl. Ra's Al Ghul will be in 4 episodes and we'll get to see the villians put Batman on trial at Arkham. Even Alfred Gets a Real Good Battle With Red Claw. Plus Batman fights Bane, Catwoman and more. this is a must have.Episode list:557- Shadow of the Bat Pt1558- Blind as a Bat559- The Demon's Quest pt1560- His Silicon soul561- Shadow of the Bat pt2562- Fire From Olympus563- The Demon's Quest pt 2564- Read my lips565- The worry Men566- Sideshow567- A Bullet for Bullock568- The Trial569- Avatar570- House & Garden571- The Terrible Trio572- Harlequinade573- Time out of Joint574- Catwalk575- Bane576- Baby-Doll577- The Lion and The Unicorn578- Showdown579- Riddlers Reform580- Second Chance581- Harleys's Holiday582- Lock-up583- Make'em Laugh584- Deep Freeze585- Batgirl ReturnsBuy now"
5,Great Series to add to the Collection!,"Just purchased each volume(1-4), verus the Complete set. Heard there were counterfits from China for the complete set. Saw the video on youtube on the counterfits. I figured it was a safer way to go instead of buying crap. These sets work perfectly for watching old school cartoons."
5,Awesome,This was purchased as a gift for my daughter. She really loved it! It is exactly what she was expecting.
3,Batman,Thought preview was too old for a 5 year old. Did not rent or buy. Need Movie that is alittle less violent.
3,Limited Edition Batman and Robin Cel,"I ordered Super Friends Volume 2 and Batman - The Animated Series, Volume 3. I got the limited edition cel in Super Friends Volume 2 but I didn't get the limited edition cel in Batman - The Animated Series, Volume 3. I saw the advertisement in Entertainment Weekly and it said that there is a limited edition cel in both DVD's. I feel ripped off, if I bought it in a retail store and it didn't have the sticker saying that it has the sticker with limited edition cel, I would of never purchased it. It didn't even have the decoder. This is false advertisement. If anyone else has this problem or know if I can still get the limited edition cel, please let me know."
5,Love it.....BUT,"i loved it but while i was watching the second disk it started to skip :/?, so i took the disk out of the DVD player to see that it had this layer of what looked and felt like hair spray im not a genius so i cant tell you what it really was but it wasn't the DVD player because its never happened before and its fairly new. Im not really upset, the stuff came off eventually after alot of careful clean with my glasses cloth and cleaner with maybe a minor scratch (which i almost missed). So anyway its fine now, the other disk are perfect as well it was just that disk (which was weird :/) I rated this a 5 because i love the Animated series i grew up with but also because this could've happened if i had bought this at say Best Buy or Wall-Mart (CAUSE IT HAS!!!) so its no big its harmless and easy to fix and other than that it was awesome :D and totally worth the money i spent."
5,Classic Batman goodness,"How can you go wrong with the Animated Series? This is just a continuation of one of my all-time favorite series. If you love Batman, this is a must own. Especially for those of you that already have the first two volumes."
5,The Bat,"A definite buy for the Batman Fan and for the comic fan in general. I own Volumes I & III and these DVD collections are tremendous. There are not many special features included in these DVD's but having the complete season at your viewing pleasure is worth while. I defintely plan to obtain Volume II as soon as I can. For those people who think that a cartoon cannot be entertaining this series will prove you wrong. The storylines are strong and captivating. The writers have done a great job at introducing novice viewers and vetran fans of Batman, to their unique style of story development. Volume III is without question the pinnicle to the series which leaves fans wanting the original animated series to continue. Bruce Timm and Staff, Thanks for the Memories!"
2,Awesome collection,"Really awesome collection! Only downfall is, that they probably played football with it during shipping, so the nice US version paper cover didn't resisted much and the corners of the box and inside paper case are badly damaged and as a result, I have trouble to pull it out. Also one error is, that the first DVD in the set is somewhat badly encoded and picture is not sharp, but the lines are blurry. This problem isn't presented on other discs....I love it for the viewing purposes, but as it came this bad and one disc is faulty, I give only two stars.Guys who will steal this for free by download, will get the same thing sans faulty physical thing, which they are forced to look at.Well, Sure I can make a reclamation, but it's painfull process, as I'm living in Europe.When I was buying stuff on Canadian Amazon, the stuff was brought right before my door by DHL courier in next two days (From Canada to Czech republic!!!!). So this is my last purchase from US."
4,"Good standard Batman, but a few things could have been better","This is standard fair for the Batman animated series. All around good stuff. However, a few minor points to make (which lower it from 5 to 4 stars).- Many of the episodes are the Batman and Robin series - basically a slightly revamped version of the original seasons. Nothing against Robin, just the writing on all of them doesn't seem quite as high quality.- There are very few extras - in fact some of the discs have an extras section in the menu, but when you go to that screen, all it says is ""check the other discs for more extras"".If you're just getting into the Batman animated series, get the first 2 sets in the series first."
2,Yawn! Quite boring :-(,"I was quite bored reading this book. It goes on in a higher middle class/lower upper class milieu in the UK. So the people in this book leads a comfortable life, with little struggle. They are simply born into a certain economic status and rank. They are quite uninspiring and doesn't really seem to have any strive or be going anywhere. The novel centers around the females in the families and we hear about the daily humdrum of their lives, walking the dog, arguing with the husband, having tea and so on."
1,IT LACKED THE CONSISTANCY AND EFFORT OF A NATURAL BOOK.,"THIS BOOK WOULD HAVE BEEN AN INTERESTING COMMENTARY ON THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM, BUT IT LACKED THE LEVITY THAT A READER WOULD ENJOY. IT SEEMED BANAL AND AN EFFORTLESS JOB FOR ATTRACTING READERS. IF THIS SUBJECT WAS MORE APPEALING TO MY STANDARDS, I WOULD HAVE SUBMITTED A MORE PRODIGIOUS AMOUNT OF TIME TO ACTUALLY FINISH THIS BOOK. TO THIS AUTHOR'S POINT OF VIEW, HE WAS SUGGESTING THAT OUR AMERICAN JUDCIAL SYSTEM WAS CORRUPT AND CHAOTIC. I FELT HE FALLIOUSLY EDITED AND RESEARCHED ON THIS TOPIC. MNOOKEN STATED THAT OUR CHILDREN WERE ""MONSTERS"" AND I BELIEVE THAT IS FLAT OUT LIE AND A TERRIBLE OVERVIEW OF THE SOCIETY WHICH OUR COUNTRY LEAD."
1,Rip off. ZERO STARS!,"I bought these products for my LG Cu500 phone. They all came in awful packaging saying ""Made in China, Deisgned in the USA"". looked like they had been bought for 10c a piece in some pirated chinese market.the leather case couldnt fit my phone, had some weird plastic thing to hold the phone in place. same for the belt clip. the phone would fall off the clip. the hands free mic was of the poorest quality. i threw the whole thing away.DONT BUY THIS!"
2,poor quality,"The only slightly valuable product is the phone cover and car charger. The phone holder looked used and broke before I even got it put in the car. I tried to go ahead and put it up in the car and the sticky pad provided is worhtless. Does not hold the empty phone holder, let alone with a phone in it. The hands free ear bud is so small and light it won't even stay in."
2,Okay Product,The package deal was a great buy but the cell phone clip broke in less than a week. Everything was great in the deal except the cheaply made clip.
5,"Voice of the centuty, Menuhin","Very good sound and remarkable performance. You can see what a great personality was Menuhin. Very interesting the history of music and country. All my friends came to me to watch this film. And everybody liked it. However, after this film I cannot listen some other violinists at Davies Hall. Nobody can be compared with Menuhin. it is really is voice of the century.G."
1,Doesn't work!,worked for about ten minutes then stopped pulling paint through the jar and out of the airbrush but rather blew bubbles into the paint jar. would not recommend this product unless you can complete a project in ten minutes and are willing to throw away the money you just spent
1,Very bad product,I got this product today and it looks in a bad shape and is not new at all. There is some paint on the plastic box. I was supposed to get a new set but they sent me a very bad used set.
3,Bette in the 80's,"This albulm is real departure to Bette's earlier stuff and is a real reflection of the 80's, and once again Bette has captured the sound and feel of this time. This is not the greatest Bette albulm, but any Divine Miss M fan should have this in their collection."
4,Simply divine!,"I regard Bette's ""All I Need To Know"" as one of the most beautifully sung love songs of all time. I was not pleased at all to hear Linda Ronstadt and Aaron Neville butcher this song years later."
5,One of Bette Midlers most under rated Jewels,"I first bought this recording after its release and it has been a favorite for almost 15 years. It has something for everyone Rock, Country with steel guitar and of course Bettes campiness. Very well put together and thought out to coincide with her tour in the same year DE TOUR. Should command Air Play if her promoters would release singles of her more uptempo tracks."
4,Concise but a bit boring (sorry),"This is a good summary of the history of Japan. It spans all topics and is quite balanced in social, political and economic issues. McClain's book takes quite an academic approach to Japan's history, (without exessive notes of course). It is well founded, he is precise, concise and avoids controversal or journalistic subjects and speculation (such as whether Roosevelt knew about the attac on pearl harbor). In this sense this book can be highly recommended for those readers who look for a no-nonsense textbook. However, this style makes the read a bit boring. Compared to other historical books I have read I found it hard to read and - as a non-english native speaker - it took me a long time. Because the writer never goes deep into one subject, the reader gets only a kind of the summary of an issue. The book is never really gripping and as a more casual reader it is probably not my the first choice. John Dower and David Nathan have left me more inspired."
2,"If you plan on doing more than a little cutting, get a lubricated cutter.","This would be good for someone who only needs this for a one time use and wants something cheap. If you plan on using it for more than just a little, do yourself a favor and upgrade to a cutter that has an oil reservoir and a more comfortable grip. They make them in a ""pistol grip"" style or a straight style. I prefer the straight style which has a fatter grip area. But even then I still wrap mine with electrical tape so that it contours my hand better.This type of cutter will work, but your cut probably won't be as clean and your hand is going to really hurt after awhile because it isn't very ergonomic."
3,A Great Prog Effort,"After Foxtrot, England by the Pound, and Lamb, this CD should be purchased.It's amazing, when this record was recorded, Genesis was virtually living in their van, which was also used to haul their equipment!Contrary to ignorant critics, Phil Collin's first lead vocal appearance is actually on this album (and not England by the Pound) on the tune ""For Absent Friends.""Much of the album is as strong as their later efforts, such as ""Musical Box"" and ""Harold the Barrel"" (what a great tune!), but I didn't like the droning ""Hogweed"" or ""Fountain of Samalcis,"" whose production quality is so poor it affects the listener's enjoyment beyond reason.""Seven Stones"" is brilliant, and I get chills just thinking about that song!Don't be deterred, the good material makes this CD very worthy of purchase, and all of this is better than the Collins-era Genesis pop that was to follow Gabriel's departure."
3,Music great...remastering lousy,"Four stars for the music. Growing up in the early 90's, I wrote off Genesis without hesitation. But recently I was searching YouTube and found a live version of The Musical Box and realized I was wrong all of these years (Genesis actually did make good music once). I tried to buy the Import version of this album from Genesis but was informed it is no longer available even though it is still posted for sale. So I bought the remastered off eBay.Two stars for the remastering. The Musical Box remastering is appalling. The volume is all over the place, the bass is muddy and lost and vocals get lost in the background, making it painful to listen to. The rest of the remastering on the CD gets better but suffers from the same problems.One reviewer here mentioned getting the vinyl version which I will try to hunt down, hopefully it doesn't have these same issues."
3,Flawed but classic,"Nursery Cryme was Genesis's first album with Phil Collins on drums and Steve Hackett as guitarist. It is a radical departure from the pastoral Trespass, but signalled a new, tighter, more aggressive era. Nursery Cryme may not be as consistent and as successful as its successor, Foxtrot, but it has moments of sheer genius. Fountain of Salmacis and the awesome Return of the Giant Hogweed are classics while Harold the Barrell and Harlequin showcase the quirkier, more eccentric, English-whimsy side of the band. One thing: get it on vinyl if you can - the CD does not do the music justice."
2,Peter Gabriel,"This is not Foxtrot. Selling England by the Pound or the Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, I am a Gabriel fan not Genesis. Gabriel with Genesis created some of his most remarkable material vocal range wise. There are inklings of that on Nursery Cryme especially with Musical Box but not much. The album is interesting in showcasing the inadeqaucies of Genesis even with Peter Gabriel. The Genesis Live cd with Gabriel is much better but this one has interest to those music historians interested in progression of artists. It is amazing that the phenomenal Foxtrot followed this sophormoric work and then the masterpiece Selling England BY the Pound followed by an underwritten classic The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway. A dj friend of mine used to assert that Lamb was probably the first issuing in of the punk rock era as we knew it. I would always counterattack with the Stooges and Iggy Pop, the counter-comment was 'I mean intelligent punk rock, new wave.'"
2,A Sign of Things To Come,"Uneven, sometimes unlistenable, but definitely a preview of greater things to come on Foxtrot and Selling England By The Pound. The standouts are ""The Musical Box"" and ""Fountain of Samacis."" Album suffers because of the technology of the day (i.e. very early synthesiser/mellotron.)"
5,A Horror Story,"When I listen to Nursery Crime and specially when I listen to The Musical Box I imagine it as a perfect screen play for a horror movie being produced by Hammer Pictures. It's bloody, gruesome, wonderful. It's the perfect Genesis."
5,Gabriel-era Genesis is best!,"There are two types of Genesis fans: pre Gabriel and Post Gabriel. If you like sell-out ""pop""ular music, listen to post-Gabriel Phil Collins Genesis. If you like good progressive tunes (that weren't written to make money of hit the charts, but for the love of really good music), then Gabriel-era Genesis is for you. Listen to ""Genesis Live"", ""Nursery Cryme"", and ""Foxtrot""."
3,Nursery Cryme - the early days of Genesis,"This is an early album by Genesis, and a far different sound than what came later in the seventies.It's okay, but nothing really memorable. I bought it because I was curious about what kinds of songs they recorded in those days. Not surprised that this album flew under the radar back then."
3,compressed sound,"I have read some other reviews where the Genesis remixes sound compressed (US non-lossless versions DTS, DD and CD it burns me that we (US) keep getting passed over for the lossless recordings). I am sorry to write that the European SACD version sounds compressed as well. I cant recommend this SACD but I do recommend the Japan version of Foxtrot which has far better sound on both the SACD and DTS version."
2,Depends on what comes in the mail!,"Each of the two times I ordered this from this very page, I did get an import, from Argentina, but they sound just like the 1994 remaster. It's probably only a reissue. For the NURSERY CRYME to which the first-seen review here refers, you may have to buy the box set where it's found. I couldn't find it anywhere on Amazon singly. It IS a vast improvement over every earlier pressing. But this item ain't that. Maybe it used to be. If you want the 2008, I'd select a smalltime seller and ask them the details. Don't be fooled if you hear it's a Virgin release. The cover date even says 1971, 1994, not 2008! The liner notes are also the exact same as the 94s."
5,One Of My Personal Faves,"I love this Album/ CD! Everyone should listen to ""The Musical Box"" simply to hear the true genius of Genesis. ""Nursery Crymes"" is one of those recordings that grows on you. I remember feeling that way when I purchased the LP over 3 (!!!) decades ago. It just ""clicked"" with me. Every track (""...Hogweed"", ""Fountains..."" especially) resonates with a feeling that the group was striving to be as creative as possible. I really admire that. Some people have difficulty getting into it because thay claim it ""sounds too dated"". I think anyone who appreciates Prog Rock must have this recording in their collection."
4,A strong effort,Nursery Cryme was the third Genesis album of their early period (1967-1975) and even better then Trespass though thats a four star album too. Phil Collins and Steve Hackett were good additions to the band and the playing all around is quite good. The only drawback is the short throwaway songs For Absent Friends and Harlequin in the absence of a good long song. The 3 long songs on the album are very good as are the fun Harold The Barrel and the more dramatic Seven Stones.
3,"Some things get better with age, others don't.....","Genesis, in the Gabriel era, is one of my favorite band, I have once regard this album as a masterpiece. But time has passed and hearing it again shows that the album has not stand the test of time. I have listen in the same afternoon Nursery Cryme, followed by Yes ""Close to the Edge"" and it clearly show to me that Close to the Edge is a prime example of an album that passed the test of time, but Nursery fails. Still a good album but not an album that I will listen often in the future."
2,Not a good mix,"Too much of a contrast between the old on the new. ToT was a great band, but they're going too far into another direction that will not yield good results. The same techno thing happened to Danzig and Paradise Lost. The strained relationship between the members of ToT and Liv Kristine were obvious in the last few albums. She definitely was not feeling their new music as she's a devout metalhead. If you like old ToT, buy Liv's Leaves' Eyes album.Getting back to Closure, the Aegis songs are great. The techno songs don't fit at all. I was like, ""WTF?"" And I'm open to that stuff. Der Tanz wasn't so great because they played the version that doesn't rock as much.Overall, this was a bland live album and I'll be reselling it most likely."
5,"Great research, wonderful detail","The extensive background presented for the cities and the schools may get tedious to the casual reader, but for anyone involved with the schools and their football programs, it is a wonderful read. I was delighted to find a complete replay of the game. Wallace's description of De La Salle and its program is very accurate, and shows the effort he put into understanding everything about it. I enjoyed the insight into Poly and its program; since Wallace is a Poly grad, I'm sure his description there is even more accurate. It is also enlightening to see the bigger picture, the way competition with St. Louis of Hawaii and with Mater Dei helped to shape the events. I was there for most of it, and he's right on. Bravo."
3,Two Dreams,I bought this as a gift for a teen with reading difficulties. It looked a bit intimidating - maybe some pictures would help.
4,Literary Formation,"High School football stories (fiction and non-fiction) are all the rage this season. BLEACHERS, OVERTIME, even AROUND ELVIS has a great high school football story in the middle."
4,One of the few books that focus on NLP as it was meant to be,"If one would make of the great NLP modellers, Robert Dilts will certainly be part of the list. As well as he would make it to the top 5 list of NLP's great writers. Being one of the sudents of Dilt's Modeling & Epistemology class at NLP University, I'm quite familiar to Dilt's ideas about modelling. Much of the thinking explained in this explains the process I've been going through while writing ""7 steps to emotional intelligence"". The great point of NLP modelling is that it focusses on people that are excellent in a certain area (have a certain competence, supported by certain beliefs)- this book describes how you derive ""the pattern that connects"" by studying several experts in a domain. You get the ""how"" as well as examples of NLP modelling. The only problem is that it takes a considerable level of NLP skills before you can put this book into practice."
4,"But his best work and the classic is still, Sleight of mouth","reading Sleight of Mouth by Dilts gave me a truespiritual epiphany! in the deepest sense and changedmy life forever. this book is a later one. Dilts is a goodCatholic boy as i have heard Bandler suggest who wasamong the first at UC Santa Cruz to learn of NLP. I highlyrecommend his work, ""Sleight of mouth"" to transform yourlife with empathy for not only yourself, but others and showyou how to heal yourself and or others with the techniques inthis book. Michael Hall's book on logical levels is perhapsmore informative and flush, but Dilts here is the pioneer in manyways and in my mind this book is still valid and a classic."
4,the facts,this is a very accurate & concise view into the witness fraternity and the way the rank & file are treated by the upper echelon of what really is a damaging psudo religious cult
3,Does the Watchtower know....,"To the many Witnesses on this site I want to ask: Does the Watchtower know that you are surfing the web? You are not allowed to read anything but approved Watchtower literature. What are you doing on Amazon looking at ""Satanic"" books?This is meant as a criticism of the Witnesses, not the book."
1,Horrible,"I believe that Jehovah's Witnesses have the truth. Anyone who allows themselves to believe rumors and accusations without first speaking with the witnesses are just as ignorant as the author. You need an unbiased approach, not that of the example we have here. They use the New World Translation (not a version) and do not limit themselves to just that. They will use your Bible as well. Plus in addition, they not only print the New World Translation but other translations as well, such as the King James Version. Jehovah's Witness teachings reflect the teachings of the 1st century Congregation and not that of tradition etc. Former JW's are those who wanted power and glory for themselves but they couldn't get it there because the witnesses serve God and not men. So such proud ones are removed to protect the congregation. I would strongly sugest that this book should be considered un-trustworthy."
5,Mandatory reading in this tough economy,"I've checked out dozens of books on resume writing, effective networking and job hunting. Job Search blows them away because it is so detailed and non typical. Not only does it give powerful examples of resumes and cover letters, to preparing for interviews....it goes deep and avoids the fluff. What really makes it special is that Ken and Sheryl delve into the psychology of the job search. From dealing with rejection, specialized negotiating skills (I loved this section), to building relationships with your network. With unemployment so high and with people struggling to find work, reading (and studying) this book would give anyone a hugely competitive advantage over their peers."
4,"BarrettTillman's""Corsair""","This offering by Barrett Tilllman is one of the more readable accounts of WWII naval aviation. Tillman goes into enough depth to give the reader an appreciation for the technology and engineering involved in the F4U Corsair, but rightly devotes most of the book to the stories of the aviators who flew the ""Ensign Eliminator"" in combat. Anecdotes related to the author by veteran Corsair drivers, added to Tillman's own knowledge and experience in flying WWII aircraft lend authenticity to the work. Very well researched, this book is a valuable resource for the student of WWII or aviation,but its style also recomends it to the casual reader."
3,Should have been a pamphlet,"I wavered between two and three stars, and finally went with three because this book does, in truth, address a specific market with specific needs for specific information. The author makes some very valid points and certainly, when one's world is reeling after the discovery of an extra-marital affair, some good, sound advice is exactly what is needed.BUT... the sounds advice does not need to be repeated and repeated and repeated. Make the point, give an example, and move on.The most annoying thing about this book, however, is the very poor editing. It is difficult, in fact, to believe that this is the ""revised edition"" as it is replete with typographical errors. I found the fonts (there are far too many variations of italics, size, boldness) distracting as well -- a good graphics page designer could make this work much more appealing and readable, and a good editor could tighten up the content. The work would benefit and so would its audience."
3,"Goldner with anger management issues, posing as an expert","Inside the book cover reads ""Dr. Rhodes and Dr. Goldner are available for personal coaching"".Dr. Norman Goldner is married to Dr. Carol Rhodes. Dr. Rhodes gives credit to her husband for ideas, ... in the book.I happen to have had the unfortunate experience of Dr. Goldner as a marriage counselor in Rochester MI. He would have major impulsive anger outbursts over such trivial issues. He is a very huge man together with his anger management issues, he was quite intimidating as a marriage counselor. From that encounter, Dr. Goldner as a marriage counselor brings to mind an expression of ""the Odd studying the ID""."
1,poor advertisement,"First off trhere was or is no assortment. I received one bottle of treatment. The ad shows four. POOR, feel taken"
2,One major defect,"I've had this phone for one year. It has excellent battery life and is very reliable but it has one major defect: The ringer volume key sticks out on the side of the phone and is very sensitive so that often an unintended movement (for example, simply putting the phone in your pocket or purse) will change the ringer volume. As if that weren't bad enough, the loudest volume setting and the mute setting are adjacent settings. In other words, pressing the ringer volume key one time takes you from loudest volume to mute. So you often think your phone is set to the loudest volume when in fact the ringer is turned off. I can't tell you how many important calls I have missed in the last year because of that defect."
4,A great funny movie,"Though this is not as universally funny as some of Kevin Smith's previous movies. this movie is a movie lover's delight. Not only are Jay and Silent Bob still as funny as hell, but this movie manages to cram enough in-jokes and movie pastiches into itself to guarantee that there will be something here for everyone. Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back may not be for the easily offended but if you can put your prejudices on the back burner for an hour and a half, you ought to enjoy this movie. Afterall, any movie that features Morris Day and the Time has GOT to be a winner, doesn't it?Bonnnnng!"
5,Jay and Silent Bob's mental laxative.,"It was the weekend following 9/11. If there ever was a time to find a few hours of release from reality, this was it. So, off I went, my girlfriend in tow, to the local multiplex where for the next two hours, I laffed myself into oblivion. We're talking chest pains, tears and rough throat. It was what I needed to deal with that situation. However, when the lights came up and I looked at my dear, beautiful lady, who is very professional and deals with judges,lawyers and minions of the law for a living, I recieved a stern look. She then advised me I was NEVER to tell any of her friends that she had seen this movie. So, ya' know, it's all in your outlook. I recomend this movie. She doesn't."
2,"Great movie, but AVOID the Alliance studios blu ray...","I bought this from ""inetvideo"" and saw mention of a chance that the product might have a bilingual cover. Well, turns out I was sold the Alliance studios release, not the Dimension one. I can't speak for Dimension, but Alliance pulled off a DVD rip of this movie and pressed it onto a BR disc. I used to own the 2 disc DVD and my blu ray looks maybe 5% better. AVOID the Alliance studios release (It's got French all over the back cover you'll know it if you see it) at all costs."
4,Very Exceptional,"This movie ,like all other Jay and Silent Bob movies, is extremely stupid, but this is the reason we love it so much. I mean it's not like it was created to win a Grammy or anything like that. It's was created to entertain the average pot-head, which is exactly as it did in this case;)"
3,Bare bones!,"I love this movie so I'm not going to bother reviewing it, I knew what I was getting when I bought it, except for one thing...My beef is with the severe lack of ""bonus"" content on this blu-ray release, there is director commentary, that's it...nothing else. The price was not bad ($15 at the time I got it) but for a blu-ray disk from a Kevin Smith movie to not have any bonus material is pretty pathetic if you ask me. Major bummer, would have liked more stuff included, I would have paid more for that opportunity as well...I only buy movies I watch all the time, and when I do buy them I prefer for them to have tons of extras for when I get bored."
4,"""Jay and Silent Bob"" rocks","I have seen this movie twice already and I loved every minute of it. It was hysterical. Even though it did have a lot of jokes in it that are really only funny if you have seen all of Kevin Smith's films, there are still plenty of funny moments to keep a newcomer to the characters of Jay and Silent Bob laughing till it hurts.Now, I just recently became a Kevin Smith fan over this past summer and I have seen all of his films. I am a huge fan of his work, even ""Mallrats"", and I think that ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" is one of his best so far. Definitely check it out."
5,Kicks...,"Wow! That is all I have to say. WOW! This movie was the best! Kevin Smith has outdone himself this time. He borrowed from the best and improved on the bad. The gay jokes were light hearted but I can see why people are so sensitive about it. I personally think they were great and totally in character for the dynamic duo J & SB. SB only talks like twice in the whole movie but as always, he shows his underlying intelligence. And J? Well, we ALL thought it was about time for him to get some, so why not let it be Shannon Elizabeth? Oh, and if you have seen the movie already, this next line was indeed long awaited and I'm glad that Kevin convinced Mark Hamill to say it: ""Don't fluck with the Jedi Master!"" :) So in conclusion, Rock on, Kevin Smith! May the Movie Force be with you! LOL"
3,J&SB go out with a bang (sort of),"Chances are if you're a Kevin Smith fan you won't even be reading this because you will own this DVD regardless of what I or anyone else writes about it. But for those not in the know, go rent/buy Smith's previous DVDs: Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, & Dogma. After that come back and watch J&SBSB. Your viewing pleasure will be incresed 100 fold. Only dissapointment on this DVD is we get the worst director & cast commentary of any of Smith's films. A genuine dissapointment as his other commentaries have been more entertaining than most comedy movies."
4,Jay and Silent Bob are back,"Very funny movie and one of Kevin Smith better movies but not his best work because the sexual humor goes little beyond crossing the line but still has lot of good humor and great one liners. Just be prepared for many bad words left to right from the character Jay. It is still an enjoyable movie and very funny but rough in many scenes, so if you buy this movie just make sure no one under 18 watches this. But if you still want to laugh till ribs hurts then pick this movie up and laugh so hard bust a gut."
5,Excellent service,Ordered the movie and it arrived within 3 days. Perfect packaging and prompt service! I am always impressed and will continue to order! Great movie for sure lol
3,"Raucous, raunchy, and very funny","I think this movie must set the world's record for the use of ""the F-word""--not to mention that it's a hilarious send-up of how Hollywood works. If you like Kevin Smith's very irreverent sense of humor, or will enjoy a movie that pokes fun at movies, you'll get a kick out of it.Rated R for ""nonstop crude and sexual humor, pervasive strong language and drug content"". If anything, that's an understatement. No nudity, though--I guess they didn't want to offend anyone *cough* *cough*."
4,Funny but has too much foul language and stupid moments,"This movie is decent, it's funny but it has too much foul language and stupid moments that keep it from being any better. This movie thinks that just because its characters use foul language, it is always gonna be funny. Considering what goes on in this movie, that is proven to be false. Despite these issues, this movie is fun to watch, but it's not for everyone considering the type of comedy that it does. 8/10"
5,Funniest Movie Of The Year,"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is by far the funniest movie to be released this year. As the fourth edition in Kevin Smith's brilliant saga, this movie supassed my expectations by far. Granted, this is not one for the young folks. It is rude, crude, and very filthy, but isn't that what makes it better? I watched this movie in the theatre 5 times, and was the first person to buy the dvd. If you don't get offended easily by crude humor, and enjoy laughing non-stop, this one is for the ages."
1,A Weak Bill&Ted,this is nothing more than a Lame Cameo dropping take on Bill&Ted's Adventures from back in the 80's.the film is cheap jokes&waste of Cameos.Chris Rock had some funny moments.cool seeing the Group The Time because in all Honesty that is the Main reason why I wanted to watch this Film in the first place.the film never connected to me at all.some funny skits but Lame overall.
3,It's a Kevin Smith movie,"As is the title to this review if you know Kevin Smith you know what your getting with this movie. In saying this it has foul language,sexual innuendos, drug references, and drug imagry. As I have said in many other reviews of Kevin Smith movies, if you enjoy his stuff then this movie is hilarious. This is pure adult comedy that harkens back to Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy. Anyone who rates this movie bad just really didn't understand what they were going to watch or what type of movies Kevin Smith makes."
3,stupid plot,The lack of a good plot or dialogue make this movie painstaking to watch. Eliza Dushka and Shannon Elizabeth in skin tight black leather more than make it a must see for geeks like me everywhere.
2,I'm a fan...but this disappointed me.,"Let me first say off the cuff that I worship Kevin Smith. I thought Mallrats was hilarious, that Dogma was genius, and that Chasing Amy is one of the best relationship/comedy movies that will ever be made. I missed this latest film of Kevin's at theaters, and couldn't wait for the dvd release...I bought it right away, without any preview or rental. Such is my faith in Smith's ability to entertain. And I always found Jay and Silent Bob priceless. I couldn't believe what I saw. The movie let me down. It seemed like a two-hour inside joke that I wasn't in on. I kept on trying to look for some redeeming joke or humor in the film, but as the credits rolled I was at a loss. There are some funny moments---Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Jason Lee goofing off. But that just didn't justify a purchase at all. For fans I'd have to say it's a periodic rental at best. If you aren't a fan, don't even think about seeing this film. Hope Kevin makes it up to us in Jersey Girl."
2,Sorry it had to end this way,"If there is one thing that a Kevin Smith movie has ALWAYS had is great dialogue. Real, natural discussion has been the corner stone of every one of his movies until now. I dare someone to find me a single quotable conversation in this movie that compares to the ""contractors for the death star"" from Clerks, ""what designates a food court?"" from Mallrats, or the ""lesbian"" speech from Chasing Amy. Unfortunately all we get instead is a long series of gay jokes.I laughed twice during this whole movie. What a sad way to put these characters to bed......."
1,A huge disappointment for a Kevin Smith fan ..,".. First off, let me say, I adore Kevin Smith - I have Chasing Amy, and Dogma, and will pick up Mallrats when I run across it.I just think he's the greatest. Which is probably why this movie was a huge letdown. Following Dogma, which was pure genius, and geniunely, consistently FUNNY; I can't understand what went wrong with this film. All the premises were right on; I don't think the actors were all ""on"" however. It must have just looked a lot better on paper, than it came out on film.I didn't have any problem with the vulgarity; except maybe it was a tad excessive, and gratuitous..I just didn't laugh through this whole movie. I kept waiting for it get funny, and it just didn't.I'm sorry Kevin, if you're reading this; but you can probably take it."
2,KEVIN SMITH NEARLY STRIKES OUT,"Although they are amusing in small doses, as in Kevin Smith's previous movies, this movie is mostly stupid and annoying. Not that that's a bad thing; some of this is actually very funny. After finding insulting comments about themselves on a film website, the two losers head to Hollywood to stop a movie about them being made with James Van Der Beek and Jason Biggs, ""the pie f**king dude"" playing them. Along the way Jay finds true love with Biggs' AMERICAN PIE co-star Shannon Elizabeth. Put your brain on hold and you might enjoy this, I was in a more serious frame of mind when I watched the movie, but it's still much better than MALLRATS. Watch out for the expected cameos from Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, as well as directors Wes Craven and Gus Van Sant."
1,Failed transmission from the one trick pony! Get away!,"This famed key grip resident of philly. I saw him at Iversan. Iversan had no machine gun, only gunmachine. But how is this fat man so? I axed Gad, and Gad sed this man is not. What the hak! Look at him. He smoke pot, he btter smoke put becaus he is sooo fat. No ph, thanks I get it. Now thois movie is bad cinematorgrapy. There is lights, but highlight? I never sawr it *** Where? Soundtracj was gos buyt Stephon Marbury prodcued. This Jersey Girl, this Jersye Gitrl! Ben Affleck, fdares to defy this Jersey Lopea. I abject to frenumb this largo locution."
2,Kevin Smith finally makes a bad film. Unfortunatly.,"Smith made this instead of the proposed 'Clerks 2'. This film is not a fraction as funny as it thinks it is, Jason Lee has two parts but no funny lines and the cameos from the view askew old skool cast are far too short and all come together when they should have been spread across the film. A bad way to end the trilogy.Nuff said."
2,"so bad, it's funny","I mean, you see a movie like this, you know what you are getting into. It is not so much a story as a series of endless gags. The big setup is the idea of this brainless slacker who swears as frequently as a carrier drinks water on a summer's day. It is funny, and i got a few laughs in there, in between the snacks etc. At the end, on stage, you just knew that Kevin Smith was acting out the fantasy of 'performing' with one of his fave 80's soul bands. Feel good movie about dissing ""the man"", and ""feel"" starts with the letter ""f""...plenty of that here."
5,this is a part of 5 related movies,"If you're wondering why some people like this movie and some don't, the answer is simple: those who don't like it are not familiar with Kevin Smith's work. Start with Chasing Amy then Clerks, Mallrats, then Dogma and then (final) Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. You will love it."
3,Kevin Smith could have done much better than this,"In his constant drive to create a mainstream teen comedy without bending too much to hollywood's whims and cookie cutter desires, Kevin Smith has subjected his fan base to a film that is at moments hysterically funny, and at others painfully stupid. The movie attempts to be mainstream while still being a part of the 'underground' culture that Smith's movies tend to take, and I think the combination is a poor one. A must to own for any Smith fan.
