5,Exactly what I wanted,"This cake topper is perfect! Exactly as pictures but much more beautiful in person. It is a wonderful height as well, perfect for two to four tier cakes, is very lightweight too."
4,A Speaker's Treasure,"""Respectfully Quoted"" is a valuable resource for anyone who need to find that witty or poignant quotation for a speech or writing.Unlike some quotation books, this one is arranged according to topic, with the authors dispersed throughout the topics.The location of just the right quote is facilitated by a List of Subjects, and Indices by Author and Keyword and Subject.I have found this book to be helpful in the preparation of speeches and articles and am sure that many others will also."
5,Cerebral Angiography for neurosurgeons/Residents,Excellent book.If your aim is to learn the cerebral circulation this books gives you excellent pictures and written explanations.It makes it easy to learn normal vascular anatomy and it also gives you an excellent review of all vascular pathologies.It is my personal opinion that it is worth reading every single chapter.
3,"Throaways, But........","XTC's throwaways are better than a lot of bands best efforts, especially most of the bands around today."
3,Hodge podge collection of curious odds and ends,"Most band's b sides and outtakes would be worth about as much as what's swept up from the floor...XTC is an exception to the rule. While not all these tracks are terrific (Officer Blue is a good example. Probably the band's worst song. There were other b sides still unreleased more worthy than this), but even the weakest b side has enough interesting stuff going on to make it fun.It's nice to finally see Mermaid Smiled available again. Andy reportedly chose this song to cut from the album because it was the shortest. It's a terrific song that should have been a bonus track on Skylarking. Heaven Is Paved With Broken Glass and Tissue Tigers are both examples of the b sides that deserved better. Both would have fit snugly on English Settlement."
2,Lukewarm,"For me Extrovert, the first cut on the disc, is easily the best song on the CD. XTC produced clever and instrumentally complex tunes during their prime. I understand why these songs were left off prior albums. Few tracks are memorable, which makes me long for a new XTC record w/ fresh ideas."
4,2nd Rate Stuff from a 1st Rate Band,"These are odds and ends... yeh, ok, rags and bones... of the greatest unknown pop band on the planet. Have had a cassette copy of this for years, great to finally have it on CD. For those who don't know XTC, my advice is to pick up either Drums and Wires or Nonsuch, then move on to Skylarking and the Apple Venus volumes... this collection is more for confirmed fans. Many of these tracks might confuse new listeners."
3,"Mostly Weak, But ...","I was surprised at how ho-hum most of this material was. I mean, it's mostly pretty unflattering stuff. BUT ""The World is Full of Angry Young Men"", a Colin Moulding song from the Mummer era, is so perfect lyrically and musically as to qualify as one of the band's best tunes (perhaps even THE best). So there is some value here. ""Heaven Is Paved With Broken Glass"" is a decent B-side, and ""Looking For Footprints"" is an unearthed artifact from the Barry Andrews-era band that holds up."
3,"Worthy, but Hardly Essential XTC","Ranks slightly above ""Go 2,"" the band's brief nadir, but ""Rag and Bone"" has lots to like. Alas, there's lots to skip over after your first listen, but at such a low price, what are you waiting for?"
5,Great,I purchased these shoes because I read great things about them. The day after I received them in the mail I ran 8 miles and had no problems!
4,great shoe,This shoe is great for running or just everyday running around. It feels true to size and width and is very cushiony and comfortable. This is my second pair of this style and I love them!
5,GREAT GLAZUNOV!,"I decided to listen to Glazunov after reading Testimony (the memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich). One thing you take away from Testimony is that Shostakovich was critical of pretty much everybody. The fact that Glazunov actually gets faint praise from Shostakovich told me Glazunov was probably a pretty good composer (in addition to being a good person as demonstrated by numerous examples: saving Shostakovich's life, protecting his Jewish students, etc.). Listening has proved this to be the case; Glazunov was great! This series of his symphonies performed by Jose Serebrier and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra is very good and this CD is my particular favorite. I love both the 4th and the 7th Symphonies. They are well composed and the playing and the sound are fantastic. If you like cacophony, Glazunov will not be your cup of tea. If you like beauty and skill, he will be."
4,Different but not disappointing,"This story is not as powerful as The Grapes of Wrath, or some of Steinbeck's other works, but this is a very well written and lesser know treasure. I would only recommend it to true Steinbeck fans though. It contains the same basic style as many of his other books. The story moves along quickly so I did not find it to be excessively boring. It was somewhat strange though. The main character Joseph is very close to his land where he has built his home. And on his land there is a great tree. In it he believes is the spirit of his dead father. He believes the tree gives him guidance. It plays a major role in the book. The book itself incorporates pagan beliefs as well as Biblical beliefs. There is happiness and tragedy as well as mystery and lust. Overall I found this book to be very good but certainly not the best of Steinbecks novels."
3,To A God Unknown Review,"TO A GOD UNKNOWN was one of the first novels that John Steinbeck wrote. However, it is not for those who are really into GRAPES OF WRATH or OF MICE AND MEN. This novel seemed to have been written when Steinbeck was dealing with religious uncertainties, as his characters are mostly single-minded caricatures representing what religion does to society. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy a good thinker book, but not for someone interested in a classic Steinbeck novel."
4,mystical novel is quite good underrated,To a God Unknown is one of Steinbecks underrated novel. This story about a youngVermont farmer who moves to California and is later followed by his three brothers has a strong mystical side that is compelling .It originatesin the main characters belief about his dead father and a large oak tree on the family property. One brother strongly disapproves of this belief and it leads to disaster The main characters and the ending are memorable even though the symbolism sometimes is overdone and heavyhanded a good underrated novel
2,Overblown,"I really must dissent here. Steinbeck later in his life made many a pronouncement concerning how it was the duty of the writer to capture the human spirit, in all its greatness and frailty. Unfortunately, in this novel I found few characters that even resembled human beings. It smacks of a young writer trying too hard; so packed with portents, symbols, mysticism, and pseudo-majestic dialog that I almost gave up on it several times. It reads almost like a book of the Old Testament. I feel his later novels, such as ""The Wayward Bus"" and ""The Winter Of Our Discontent"" do a much better job of speaking on the human condition."
2,"""Steinbeck's ambitious second novel""","I read this novel shortly after reading East of Eden and maybe that's why I give a harsh star treatment (I like E of E much more).The story is a strange intertwining of nature, religion, sacrifice, and nature that I'm surprised has not garnered more interest of late due to the present society's obsession with the environment and man's relation to it.Whereas I found East of Eden to be transparent (which I like), To a God Unknown is much more opaque. East of Eden motivated me to read more Steinbeck but I have to say this book disappointed me."
3,To a God Unknown,"The novel To a God Unknown, by John Steinbeck is about a man, Joseph Wayne, moving from Vermont to California after his father dies. When he and his family get to the house where his father lived, his relatives meet him there. One of his brothers starts killing trees because of Joseph's mournings. Joseph is a father of two girls and a boy. Joseph lived in Vermont until he finds out his father dies. When he found out that his father dies, he and his family move from Vermont to California. I didn't really like the book because of the killing of nature and Joseph's brother killing the trees. I would not recommend the book."
2,Boring Toy,"So far my 4 month old baby boy has taken interest in this toy for about 3 seconds, then his eyes wonder off for something more colorful and interesting. He likes the feel of it in his mouth, but I have to literally put it in his mouth for him to even try it. I think because it's white and small it's just not interesting for him yet....maybe soon as he grows."
2,What happen to them?,"'N Sync has done horrible with this new album. I have their first CD and that was great, BUT WHAT HAPPEND? This new Rap/R&B approach is totally different from what they should produce. I bought this CD thinking that it would be the same style of pop tunes from the original. I was misguided. Don't buy it if you want great music."
1,just like any other boy band album,"i wasn't disappointed by this album because i knew what to expect from it. It sounds just like any other album by any other boy band. this album will just be popular because nsync is popular at this moment in time. If you don't believe in me, listen to it. nothing, absolutely nothing (production, vocals, quality of sounds) is good. YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT NSYNC MAKE THEIR MONEY OUT OF YOUR POCKETS, AND YOU BUY WHATEVER THEY RELEASE, EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, YOU CONVINCE YOURSELF THAT YOU LIKE IT. I'm warning you, in a year or so nsync will be nothing. Just like happens to every boys band, like new kids on the block. you will regret you liked nsync at that time."
3,Nsync=Nstink?,"I know many people complain about their sophmore album being a Justin/Jc show, and that they're the only ones that sing the songs on the album. Hm...take a listen to ""I Thought She Knew."" Have you ever wondered how it would sound like if Jc and Justin just sang that entire song by themselves? hahah nice try. and correct me if i'm wrong but i thought that another great group, Boyz II Men had two lead singers and the other two mixed in with great harmonies to create an overall sound. (and i don't hear Justin from 98 ever singing any solos...) believe me, i have been in a youth orchestra for years, and although the tuba or cello never get the melodies and it seems as if only the violins are playing, if those elements of sound were missing then it would sound COMPLETELY different and not......WHOLE. those five guys bring together harmonies that create their overall sound."
5,Still the #1 ALBUM of ALL TIME!!!!,"I love this CD, I am getting another copy because I played my 1st copy out. this shows their talent in writing their own material, vocal, and creativity. They steal everyones heart with ""This I promise YOU"" where they teamed up RICHARD MARX for this song. BYE<BYE<BYE of course has to be the first song. that's the song that started all of this madness!!! then of course you have the hit that everyone loves.. ""IT'S GONNA BE ME""my personal favorite is #11 it has a R&B;/POP feel to it. ahh the best of both worlds. this album represents exactly what the title is, NO STRINGS ATTACHED.. they worked on this alone and with many critics doubting their ability to get an album out and have it actually sell,there first day sales were 1.1 million and in the first week 2.4 million."
5,"What Ya See Is What You Get, & They Got It!","These men have done it again! This album is one wild ride. Compared to their self-titled debut, this album hardly compares. There is something for everyone on this disk. They have a cappellas, moony ballads, continuious dance beats & wild energy. Their fast songs such as ""Bye Bye Bye"" (their first single off the album), ""It's Gonna Be Me"" & ""Makes Me I'll"" are among the most dance friendly & have a lot of great voacals. Their slow songs such as ""This I Promise You"" & ""That's When I'll Stop Loving You"" are full of 5-part harmony & outstanding vocal work, done by the 2 lead singers, Justin & Jc. Their techno songs such as ""Digital Getdown"" & ""Space Cowboy (Yippie-yi-yay)"", which Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes from TLC shines with them during her rousing rap with the fellas. If you like non-stop energy (unlike the BsB), then I suggest you pick up this album as soon as you can! Yippie-yi-yay & Bye Bye Bye y'all!"
1,I WASTED MY MONEY ON THIS CD,"The Nsync No Strings Atached CD is a big waste of money. I used to be a big Nsync fan, but this CD was so bad I went back to the store to get my money back!I mean, what happened to them all of a sudden? One day they were the best group around, and the next:big losers.I will never ever spend another penny on any of their stuff again."
4,an awesome effort but...,"""No Strings Attached"" is a really good CD. I'll review some of my fave tracks.""It's Gonna Be Me""- this is an awesome song. it's totally funky and it's a great dance song. i also like the effects on Justin's voice.""Space Cowboy""- this one took a little getting used to. i thought this was a totally stupid song but now it's kind of fun.""Just Got Paid""- a great party song. perfect for a Friday night.""It Makes Me Ill""- this is the bomb! i love everything about it, the lyrics, the beat. it's totally awesome.""This I Promise You"" - a pretty nice song. a good slow song to be a single.Those are a few of my fave tracks. It's an overall good CD"
1,PLEASE FOR GOD SAKE WE GOTTA MAKE SOME CHANGES!,"This is not music. Boys bands are not music. Britney spares is not music. Spice girls is not music. All this is something totally different. This is what 12 year old girls like because they are to young to appreciate music, which is fair enough.We gotta make some changes! It should be illegal to clasify all this rubbish as music. 'Music' needs to be segregated, south african style. Pop in one corner, music in the other corner. Radio stations, MTV, Amazon.com, record stores should not be aloud to mix the two up.I never want to hear a pop song ever again"
1,A PEICE OF JUNK,"I have always hated N'sync and I always will. Then when my brother got this CD and he always plays it full blast in his room, that drove me crazy! I mean, there just like all the other bands out there! Do NOT buy this CD!"
1,This CD Bites,I am a ten year old kid who lives in Alaska.I think Pantera and Metallica rule.Down with boy bands !Everything on this CD sounds like Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears.
4,Good music,"This CD is good but I am a little disapointed they did not put ""Music Of My Heart"" on it."
3,"To be honest, I really wanted to like this stuff","However, for some reason, it still doesn't cut it. I don't often listen to stuff that gets me too excited 'cause I get too excited. This is the UK re-issue with an enhanced feature backed up with the ""It's Gonna Be Me"" video. But, N Sync ALREADY have ONE ECD in America, you ain't supposed to have more than one during your career. I don't often find ECDs attractive because they have things that are of little interest to me. My suggestion: get it only if you're a true N Sync fan (I for one am not) and you can thank me later."
5,Absolutely Amazing!,"This CD is definitely worth the money. I used to think that NSync was one of those no talent, just looks group, but this CD proves it otherwise. With songs like This I Promise You, That's When I'll Stop Loving You, and their a cappella song I Thought She Knew, it shows that they are really talented. And if you're not into the ballads, they've got upbeat, catchy songs, not just about love but about getting rid of someone (their hit Bye Bye Bye). Another great one is It Makes Me Ill. This song is so catchy you'll be singing it in the shower until you can't stand it anymore. The CD is absolutely awesome. No wonder the group gets all the hype. I even know some of the most popular guys at my school that own the CD! They think that it's awesome too! Trust me, this is worth it. Go get the CD now!"
2,"""No Strings"" won't make it far in this""Millenniuem""...","I bought this CD in hopes that ""No Strings Attached"" would live up to all the hype that's surrounding Nsync right now... man, what a disappointment it turned out to be ! This CD is nothing but a jumbled mess of wanna-be club songs and your occasional boring, over-done love song ! The entire CD sounds like it was intended to be played a middle school dance, so the 6th thru 8th grade crowd will really get a kick out of it ! Nice try, Nsync, but NO thanks ! I'll stick to listening to the Backstreet Boys !"
1,Zero stars,"Take any song by the Rolling Stones. Even take Emotional Rescue. Compare it to anything on this CD. If you have good taste, you will see that the Rolling Stones are beyond better than NSYNC.However, it's more than a little unfair to compare flash-in-the-panners with legendary rock 'n' rollers (I'll leave you to find out who's legendary and who's flash-in-the-pan). So take another band. Try the lesser-known Steely Dan. Even their fillers stand head-and-shoulders above NSYNC's work. Keep going down the line until you've found the world's most obscure garage band. Ya know what? Even that's better than this. Oh, by the way, this is terrible."
2,Completely Bummed,"I am a HUGE 'NSYNC fan and when I heard that they were coming out with a new album, I was so excited and I couldn't wait! I'd heard that this new album was going to be a gazillion times better than the first one. Well, I bought it and I must say I wasn't impressed. I like 4 songs on the album and that's it. They've completely gone down hill. I must say that the slow-songs are WAY better then their older ones but I just wasn't impressed with their fast ones. I really wouldn't recremend this cd to you...unless you're an 'NSYNC lover and like their songs no matter what."
1,A warning from one Mom to another,"This is not your typical 'Nsync album. Their first album was good. All of the songs were clean. This one is not. There are two songs that I will not let my kids listen to. And the rest of the album is not good either. I only listened to the album once. The one song that sticks out in my mind is Digital Get Down. It is about cyber relations. I am sorry but I do not want my girls listening to that. Too bad it could not have gotten a warning label for that.If you are looking for good singing and good music, go elsewhere. This album is full of computer enhanced voices. The songs are blah, the music is blah, the whole thing is just blah.I truly wish that I could have given this album no stars. One star is way too good for it."
1,"These fags should die, die, die","Okay . . . . to start it off, I would like to state that this isn't music. It's not. Plain and simple. Synthesizers and other electronic instruments put together with their horridly silky smooth vocals is not music. It's such a shame that fags like these are polluting the radio air waves.Second of all, this recent flurry of boy bands . . . they're like fireworks. They explode at first then soon die down.Third, umm . . . let's see . . . what else . . . I know this whole review may sound judgemental and hateful, and you early-teen girls out there who like them for their looks and their dancy beat, but, plain and simple, they stink. Music these days has become so bad. We need to get back to rock - straight up good music. God save us from more bands like this."
3,I guess I'll listen to it again,"This is an ok CD. Their last one was much better by far. The only songs worth hearing are: ""Bye Bye Bye, This I promise you, Digital Get Down, Space Cowboys, and It's gonna be me"". All the rest are pretty weak. BSB's Millennium and NSYNC's self-titled Debut are much more commendable."
5,If U Are A Nsync Fan U Will Love It!,"If you love nsync than you will love the cd! If you not I would'nt Get it. It is more for the Nsync Fans. You will go crazy over this. It Has great beats and thier singing is great! I like It's gonna be me becaues it has great lyrics, Makes me Ill becaues It has a good beat, This I promise u becuse It is a great slow song and the lyrics are great and That's when I'll stop loving you because It is another great slow song. But Trust me if you a BIG FAN you will like the cd!"
5,the bomb,oh my gosh nsync is so cool and their cd is like the best. it is so cool and all the songs are cool too and they are like the best band and this is like their best cd ever. so buy it right now man. it is awesome.
1,great expectations---even greater disappointment,"I had high hopes for this sophomore debut and they were all dashed the moment I got beyond track 1--the fun single ""Bye, Bye, Bye"". The remainder of ""No Strings..."" is a hodge podge of lame attempts at urban beats and luke warm romantic ballads. Their is little creativity or inspiration in this effort. Calling most of the tracks bland would be giving them way too much credit for most are simply three minutes of repetative beats and mindless lyrics. I loved the debut Nsync cd. It was fresh and full of energy. This album, however, is stale and a sad indication that ""one hit wonder"" may be how this band is known in the book of music history. One star is being generous. I want my money back, and Nsync should be ashamed for releasing such mindless and uninspired music to their many devoted fans who have waited so long for this cd. Shame on them! UGH!"
5,amazing.,"After waiting so long for Millenium and getting greatly dissapointed, I almost feared picking up 'No Strings Attached', thinking I'd get the same results.I was way off!*N SYNC have proven themselves to be a great vocal group capable of putting out music that appeals to all audiences. The new sound is so awesome. Only these 5 guys would be able to pull off R&B and hip-hop so well on a ""pop"" cd.*N SYNC is not the typical boy band, and this is not the typical cd. I like every song. Don't hesitate, pick up this cd NOW :)"
5,"Hear yee, hear yee, haters be ware!","Okay this album is not perfect but what in life is? Don't hate on these boys. Let them do thier thing.If all else fails if you have nothing nice to say don't say anything at all! I have only one complaint (if you can call this a complaint). There are only 12 tracks, BUT those 12 tracks are flava-full. The beats, the harmonies, they are PHAT (plesureful, hot, and tempting). If you are not a fan of N'sync give them a try, BUT for those of you that love them this IS for you. My fav. pics are: ""It is gonna be me"", ""Bye Bye"", ""Just Got Paid"", and my all time favorite is ""It Makes Me ILL"". I am feeling that one iN every way and I am sure that this will tickle your fancy as well. This album has a great combo for the ""hip hoppers"" and the ""slow jammers"" You need to cop this album. What can I say? Don't take my word for it just get the cd. If you don't like it that is you parogitive. But I LOVE IT and YOU can take that to the bank!"
5,Outstanding sound!,"This album is truly remarkable. I live in New York, where as you know, people are highly disected in style and taste. If you walk around town, here, the word going around is that Nsync has got it all the way. No comparision to Back street boys. Nsync beats all! Just look at the billboards! It explains it all. The Cd is a must buy. Buy two, Nsync deserves the extra money!"
5,The Boys are Back and Better Than Ever!,This album is unbelievable! I love all of the songs and they are all so different. The album touches practically every type of music and N Sync has done it again! They rule!
1,Is there a zero star rating?,"Sorry, but this album is not that good. NSYNC is trying to hard to be someone they're not (and I have yet to figure out who that is.) ""Bye, Bye, Bye"" and ""I'll Be Good For You"" are the only songs worth listening to. If you want a real good album, check out ""Millenium"" from the Backstreet Boys. Now THOSE are guys with real talented voices."
3,A bit of a disappointment...,"As a huge *N'Sync fan for two years now, I eagerly awaited the coming of their new album, ""No Strings Attached,"" with high expectations. Every time the release date was set back I would tell myself, ""That's ok, this just means the cd's gonna be even better!"" Well I guess my expectations were too high. I got the cd the first day it came out, listened to it all, swooned whenever Justin sang, and afterwards thought to myself, ""That's IT? That's all we're gonna get from them in at least a year and a HALF?"" I was ticked. Some of the songs are great but the repeatability isn't too great on this album. I got sick of it quickly, which considering how big of a fan I am, is odd. I love these guys and the hype was just too big because it left me disappointed. Buy it if you want, you might enjoy it, but I personally was disappointed. There are a few great songs but the rest of the cd isn't as I'd hoped. But NSYNC boys, I want you to know that I still love you. :)"
4,This CD is great...,"I am not a fan of all pop music but this CD really stands out. Each song has a sound of its own, and the boys have real talent. My favorite type of music is groups such as Blink 182, Lit, and Creed, and NSync doesn't really fit in with those groups, but i can tell you No Strings Attached has a permanent spot in my CD player. So, even if you aren't a fan of pop, I suggest you check this CD out-you might be surprised how catchy it is!"
2,What Happened?,"What happened to this album? Okay, so a couple of the songsare cute, and fun to dance to, but what about that Digital Get Down?JC wrote a song entirely about looking at a girl touch herself. I don't need to hear that, and I don't want to. The main possitive thing about this album is that they are still cute, but that is about all. 'NSYNC is so proud of this album, bu why? If this is really them,I'm not sure that I'll buy any more albums. 'NSYNC could, if they had stayed with the same, been around when we have kids, but if this keeps up, NSYNC won't be the number one boy band anymore. Anyone want to listen to the Backstreet Boys?"
3,Seakin' of Over-Rated Cds,"N Sync's sophomore album shows a lack of quality throughout almost every track. The vocals sound strained during most of the songs, possibly due to digital enhancement. It was very hard to determine if there were also any actual live instruments used, most sounded like they had been produced by a computer. The new R&B/Rap approach taken to some tracks also seems to be taking a step away from their current teeny-bopper style. All in all, the songs, vocals, and engineering all fall flat and sound extremely hollow. Strong Recommendation to Avoid!"
3,"Catchy, but falls short on originality!","N'Sync's ""No Strings Attached"" is an obvious copycat of the Backstreet Boy's Millenium CD. The song 'Bye Bye' is so similar in concept to BB's 'Don't want you back!' But I know that the teenyboppers will be up in arms while reading this - 'N'Sync is much more talented than BB' - they will say. Mark my words give N'Sync another 2 years, then watch them fall off the face of music!"
1,Hey amazon.com,"Okay for people who want really good music this CD will insult you will its dull lame lyrics and sounds. Remember that just because this CD sold a lot of copies doesn't mean its good. This CD has simple lyrics (take Bye, Bye Bye's simple lyrics for example), crappy sounds that wouldn't even qualify for music and of course those childish voices. Please don't make the mistake of buying this CD. Its just sad on how many people bought this CD. I pity anyone who likes N'Sync or any pop bands like them. That's just sad and I hope you people who like them will get well soon."
5,NSYNC is the Best in the world and this CD rocks!,"I think that this CD is the best that they have done yet because I can listen to it from the first song until the last without skipping any. I am a huge NSYNC fan and think that they rule. They all have great voices (especially JC) and are all really talented and really did a great job on this CD. The best songs for me are ""That's when I'll stop loving you"", ""This I promise you"", ""I'll be good for You"", ""It's gonna be me"", ""Bring'n da noise"" and ""BYE BYE BYE"" I think that any fan of NSYNC will love this CD. And will really enjoy it."
5,I Love It!,"Ever since everyone started talking about how great the new NSYNC CD No Strings Attatched was gonna be, I knew i wanted it! I got it the day it came out and i LOVE it! i listen to it 24 hours a day! I mean, yes, I do get tired of the songs sometimes like Bye Bye Bye but there all great songs! You can really tell the they worked really hard on it and they all have there own say in what songs to do! I love it and i hope all of you go out and get it!"
2,Backstreet Wannabes,While some bands seem similiar to each other the way that Nsync tries to copy Backstreet Boys is just eerie. Some nsync fans will argue that it is the other way around but actually BSB has been around for a lot longer. Maybe that's why Nsync has been getting all this hype lately: they're younger. But that doesn't always mean better. Besides some really whiny songs (it makes me ill) all of these songs sound remarkably the same. Why don't you try Backstreet Boys instead.
1,"HELP ME, I'M IN HELL ...","... This is how i felt when i listened to this album.Music is boring and bland, lyrics are banal and meaningless.This ""music"" has no soul and feelings they express through it sound fake.So how this can be one of the best selling albums today is beyond me.Do yourself a favor and go buy something else.There are many talended artist out there who aren't in your Top 40 list.Be brave and you'll discover the wonderfull world of music"
2,Ummm...,"Boring! Lacks in creativity and just general goodness. Okay for background music...I only heard it once...a friend played it for me...but that's all I want...mediocre, but not a band I can really get into. all the tracks sound the same, except Space Cowboy for it's terrible lyrics (Yippi yi yay yo! ) Puh-leeze. That's the only track that stands out, because it's so annoying. I can't believe they've sold so many records, but I guess that's just the way our society is going...down the tubes. And Digital Get down is bad. I would have given them two and a half stars, cuz they're not terrible, I just think that with all the other bands and choices out there, you can choose something better than No Strings Attached."
2,Very UNATTACHED!,"I couldn't stand the cd, No Strings Attached. I think everyone went out and bought it after the 1st song was released (Bye Bye Bye), which was the only decent song on the album! Songs such as Space Cowboy (a song which makes no sense at all) and Digital Get Down (which should be rated PG-13; it's all about cyber sex) make you do a double take when you hear about 8 year olds buying this cd. The songs are creative, but almost too creative. When you hear the album, you can tell how hard NSync is trying to be the best compared to the Back Street Boys. But NSync hasn't been around as long as the BSB and has some things to learn about the music biz. Once that happens, their music might actually be worth listening to."
5,N'SYNC is in sync,"I think the songs on this cd are very harmonious and have good rythyms. I just read the editorial review and I think it is ridiculus. From what this person said, it sounds like N'SYNC is really bad. Obviously this person is not a teenage girl who is crazy about boys!!! This cd should be number one on the charts because of the amazing vocals of Justin Timberlake and JC Chasez. I recommend this cd to anyone who is into pop music and cute boys."
4,A great step up!,*//\\//Sync has done it again! This is one of the best albums and is a gigantic step up from the first album. It also shows that they have the potential (notice we said potential) to be real artists. Now all they need to do is to learn how to play real instruments.
1,what?,What I thought N synk was where my dirty dishes were last spotted.where are they. I sure didn't clean 'em.
5,AWESOME!,This is by far their greatest CD they are gonna be around for al ong time....great songs...ALL of them are good....not only the singles but THE WHOLE THING ROCKS! GO BUY IT!
2,Not Worth the $$$,"I'll say right now I am REALLY not into pop. But, I have heard the entire CD and I'll try to give a non-biased review of the CD, actually backing up my points...For the most part, it's as though NSync can't figure out what they're trying to accomplish. They switch from the poppy, fun songs of ""It's Gonna Be Me"" and ""Bye Bye Bye"" to some weird dance songs like ""Bringin Da Noise."" I can, however, give some respect for their acapella ""I Thought She Knew"" which proves at least some talent.This is one those albums that I get sick of after listening to over and over. In truth, some of the songs I could get into and they're great for just chilling out to. But if I want music to respect and truly enjoy, I want something more than five prettyboys dancing around onstage."
1,BAD!!!,"I don't like Nsync at all, and my friend played me this cd when I was at their house, and it was terrible. The songs are all bad and have stupid lyrics."
3,Good Points Outweigh Cheesy Ballads,"Despite a few relapses to the bubble gum of their debut album, ""No Strings Attached"" is a vast improvement over the pop filled '90s. Though many songs are an obvious attempt to prove they are more than just another boy band, this album is worth getting purely for it's party appeal. (9 out of 12 songs are dance tunes.) Chasez's first attempt at mixing and writing shows promise. For true music fans however, this album is lacking in depth. Ultimately, if you are in the mood to party to good beats, this is the CD for you."
3,"Tolerable for the most part, but not what I expected","Well, it wasn't what I expected. The slow, sweet songs (All 4) were to be expected, but the best on the album in my opinion. While a few of the upbeat songs lived up to my expectations, some of them went extremely down-hill. (What on earth was JC smoking when he wrote Space Cowboy? ) Also, Digital Get Down completely shattered my vision of the boys as 'wholesome, Christian fellows'. Pardon me if I'm just not hearing it right, but the entirety of the song is just talking about cyber sex. And to think that JC wrote it... *disgusted sigh* Worth getting, but don't kid yourself that you'll love everything on it."
4,I like it,"I must admit, I like this cd. I don't usually like the boy bands but I like the upbeat nature of the songs. Good job guys."
4,GREAT!,I totally love the whole boy band thing that's happening right now and I think NSYNC has what it takes to stay around for awhile. While not as good as the Backstreet Boys they are very talented. I love almost every song on this album but the two I could live without are Bringin' Da Noise and Space Cowboy. They have a fun side in Just Got Paid and I love the phat beat in It Makes Me Ill. This I Promise You is incredibly beautiful and I Thought She Knew really show off their beautiful vocies. All in all this CD is great. Everyone should get it!
3,Disapointing,"I bought this CD, and have to say it's a huge disapointment. N Sync tries to be more R&B and more hip hop, which grealty fails, they should have stcuk to the formula they used on their first CD. The only good songs on this CD are ""Bye, Bye, Bye,"" ""It's Gonna Be Me,"" ""It Makes Me Ill,"" and ""This I Promise You."" There are a lot of songs that made me cringe, such as ""Space Cowboy,"" ""Just Got Paid,"" ""Digital Get Down,"" and ""Bringin' Da Noise."" The lyrics to these songs are just plain bad, and the songs all sound a like. If you truly want a good boy band CD, buy Millenium by Backstreet Boys."
5,*Nsync Rocks!,"Hey everyone, I just wanted to say that *Nsync rocks the world! Especialy Joey, I love you Joey! Please make more CD's! Oh yeah Justin I love your hair and I love your's too Joey! :) ;)"
1,Bye bye bye,I am soooo sick of hearing this song. These boys arent as talented as some of you would like to think they are. I bought the *NSYNC cd for my boys and I could not listen to the whole thing. I'm so glad that they like the Backstreet Boys better. They have a great deal of vocal talent that these clowns cant touch.
3,The more I listen...,"the less I like the CD. Seriously. When I first got it I LOVED it, in fact it was one of my favorite CDs, and I listened to it a bunch. Then, I started listening to it less frequently, and eah time, I could barely stand to listen to most of the songs. Bye Bye Bye was annoying me by this time because of insesive radio play, as was It's Gonna Be Me. Space Cowboy was awkward and stupid, Just Got paid has only one good part (the rap part), This I Promise With You was ok, but it was sorta too slow for mid day. Digital Get Down was much too fake to enjoy. Bringin the Noise was a weak attempt at a party-happy song, and I Thought She Knew bugs me because of all the ooooo ooooooos. So No Strings Attached, It Makes Me Ill and That's When I'll Stop Loving You are the only songs I can really stand anymore. Get BLACK AND BLUE please!!"
1,What's up with the Britney voices???,"Though these all-american boys are relatively talented, why do they feel the need to emulate their far-less talented competitor, Britney Spears?? Their new album is filled with many of the same whines as hers is - voices, themes(Digital Getdown), and the general feeling of ego before music!! Even if you liked their first recording, I would seriously consider renting this one before you spend your money on it - you've got to have a better way to throw away 17 bucks!!"
5,WOW!!!,"My name is Caitlyn, I'm 12 yrs old and I have 2 No Strings Attached CD's I love it so much, nsync's other name for it is ""DIRTY POP"" no not becaue it's nasty (cause it's not) but because of all it's different beat's all I have to say is ""IT'S A GREAT CD"""
3,Tyte: Until you've heard it more than twice,"This CDs got some awesome dance songs. Me and a few friends danced to Bye Bye Bye in a talent show, and I still haven't gotten tired of Space Cowboy. I like their first CD better, but this one is definatly a good one to have if you're going to a party. I gave it three because I like to listen to it every once in a while, but if I never hear It's Gonna Be Me again, I'll die happy."
3,A Real Opinion,"I am a BSB fan, but I still decided to buy this album since I got their debut album also. I noticed some growth in lyrics, beats, and vocals...but the main product (the song) didn't impress me much. The album has 2 good ballads (#6 and 10) and a few good fast tracks (bye bye bye..etc) I thought their move to Jive would make their sound a little better, but I have to agree with the Editorial Review and say that label mates the Backstreet Boys are still better, and will be better for awhile. Congratz to Nsync on their record...enjoy it now, or atleast for a few months until the new BSB album rolls in."
4,Coming into their own...,The cd marks the beginning of a huge change in their style. And I love the extra songs. This cd is a must-have for any fan!
5,very good,"i think its the best out of all their cd's very talente singers my fav. song is this ""I promise you"" very pretty song it has special meaning and its a deep song"
3,"Not the best, but not the worst","Overall, I think that NSync did a good job on this album, but it wasn't all that I expected. ""Bye Bye Bye"" is a good song, and I absoultely LOVE ""This I Promise You"" and ""I Thought She Knew"". BUT! Some of the other songs start to sound EXACTLY alike! It's not that they're bad songs, it's just that it's repetitive. I think ""No Strings Attached"" is a good album, and I'm looking forward to their next one too, but *IN MY OPINION* they need to add a little variety to their songs. Otherwise, great job! :-)"
5,NSYNC: Out doing the rest,"Some may think that pop music can only go so far. NSYNC proved them wrong. Their latest CD, No Strings Attached, proved that teen pop is much more than flowery music. All the songs on the CD are different and unique. They have totally out done themselves. Take it from me, if you love pop music, this is for you!"
3,Fun little pop record,"The reason albums like these are doing so good on the chart partly has to do with the fact that people have grown tired of all the depression/aggression music. People want to be a little more lighthearted and have a little fun, they're tired of being depressed all the time by grunge and gangsta rap. They want something light and bubble gummy and that's reflected in this album. My favorite songs on this disc are ""It's Gonna Be Me"", ""Bye Bye Bye"", ""Digital Getdown"" and ""It Makes Me Ill"". Bob Dylan it's not, fun: it is. I gave it three stars because most of the other songs on the album suck accept the ones I mentioned."
5,Songs and Remixes!,"This is a reissue of no strings attached and has seven extra tracks, making 19 tracks total. The extra tracks are: (not in this particulary order) Bye Bye Bye (Riprock 'N' Alex G Club Mix) and (Sal Dano's Peak Hour Dub Mix) It's Gonna Be Me (Azza's Groove Mix) and (Digital Black 'N' Dub Mix) I'll Never Stop Radio Edit and Instrumental and If Only Through Heavens Eyes, found on another version of NSA, also on the Light It Up Soundtrack. This is totally worth the money if you don't have any of their singles, because the remixes rock. But if you have their singles you have all but sal dano's peak hour dub mix (unless you bought that ridiculous bye bye bye remixes RECORD like me (but I can't listen to it!!)). So enjoy!"
3,No a bad try,"By no means is this an ""artistic"" CD. It is what I call fun music. You don't have to think, you just listen and enjoy the beat. I listen to this CD when I need a good pick-me-up. It keeps me moving and makes my annoy hour-long commute fly by.I think this was a good effort by the 5 Nsyncers, but I think they have a lot of room for growth. It is good to see that they are beginning to write and produce their own music--it shows that they are not just another group of good looking no-talent guys. They will have skills to fall back on when the Pop fad fades.Basically, this is a good effort that deserves a listen. Don't judge the 5 guys based solely on their good looks--look deeper and find that they have 5 amazing voices that when joined sound even better (as heard on ""I Thought She Knew"" in a capella)."
2,Not as good...,"I bought this CD right away figuring that there may be other songs in it equally fantastic and upbeat as ""Bye, Bye, Bye"" (like BSB's Millenium). Well, sadly, there isn't any (except for two, hence the 2 stars). I am really surprised by this seeing that these guys are ""clones"" of BSB (and should at least have 4 to 5 really good songs and the rest being audible) and they have some excellent song writers with them, too. But, all in all, this album has very little longevity. And I'm surprised that Space Cowboy, with Left Eye's help, isn't that up beat and catchy. If these guys want respect, they should hook people with real music (and it doesn't hurt if they write some, too) and not their looks. And, I'm pretty sure it's not just me, but Justin T's voice isn't all that (it sometimes gets anoying). Okay job for the songwriters -- THEY deserve the credit despite how little it is."
2,My Rating,I think Nsync is a great band. But in this cd they have more of a rap funk than pop. I think they should stick more with POP!
5,Rare Bonus Tracks,The European version of No Strings Attached. This CD has two bonus tracks (I'll Never Stop & If I'm Not The One) that you can't get here in the States! Full track listing is: 01. Bye Bye Bye 02. It's Gonna Be Me 03. Space Cowboy (Yippie-Yi-Yay) 04. Just Got Paid 05. It Makes Me Ill 06. This I Promise You 07. No Strings Attached 08. Digital Get Down 09. Bringin' Da Noise 10. That's When I'll Stop Loving You 11. I'll Be Good For You 12. I Thought She Knew 13. I'll Never Stop14. If I'm Not The One
4,An adult N'SYNC fan speaks out,"As an adult interested in a large amount of music, I must say thanks to N'SYNC for a great new album. Everyone knows that the music isn't set out to be Mozart, but for an upcoming group it is wonderful. With harmonies that put the all in unison BSB to shame, and the ability to actually sing live, I loved it. I think the use of a number of different producers expanded thier range and displayed the talent this group actually has. This is the only ""boy band"", if you would call them that, that has the talent for staying power. Good Luck guys!"
1,Meaningless dribble...,"Normally I wouldn't care what nsync is doing, but I can't help but be force-fed time and time again with the same MEANINGLESS DRIBBLE thanks to big corporate payoffs at MTV and others behind the scene.The name of the album is an oxymoron, for you all know deep down in your hearts, that the record company is milking these kids for EVERYTHING they can get.I have no problem with people buying or supporting nsync, as long as you don't live in denial of the lack of integrity these ""puppets"" display.The love of your life cannot be bought, and is probably right where you least expect it."
3,"Catchy, but hollow lyrics.","The tracks on this album are catchy, I'll admit. It is obvious that the band has matured since their last album, but most of the songs still consist of gibberish and forgetfull lyrics. It does, however, have some good variety. The songs are also adequate party/dance tunes. The band does, still, seem like one-hit wonders (especially to young teens), hopefully they'll mature more and evolve. But I guess with these kind of album sales, it doesn't matter. Overall, catchy tunes with good beats, and sloppy written lyrics."
4,"Good CD, but I thought their 1st was better.","This is a good CD especially Bye, Bye, Bye; It's Gonna Be Me, This I Promise You. I think those are the kind of songs N Sync does the best. They are GREAT at those. I personally don't care for Digital Getdown and others like that. I hope that in their next CD we will hear more like these 3 and their first CD."
5,GOOD STUFF,OK...I AM A GUY TO START WITH AND YES YOU ARE ALL PROBABLY SAYING THAT I AM WEIRD...WELL I AM NOT...I HAVE AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD SISTER WHO PRACTICALLY IS IN LOVE WITH NSYNC...SHE BOUGHT THE CD AND I MUST ADMIT THAT THOSE GUYS DO HAVE TALENT...THEY ARE NOT A TYPICAL BOYBAND..THEY ARE BETTER THAN THOSE OTHER BSB GUYS. NSYNC IS PROBABLY MORRE TALENTED THAN BSB..PEOPLE PREFER BSB BECAUSE THEY WERE FIRST..BUT THE ALBUM SALES SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES...AND Y'ALL KNOW IT..NSYNC... U GUYS KEEP IT REAL...
5,The best CD of 2000,"This is the best Cd of 2000. This CD is better then N Sync's first CD. There is more up tempo songs and the guys sound better. I love this CD and give it two thumbs up. If you only buy one CD this year buy "" No Strings Attached"""
4,n'synch again,"Honestly, I liked this album better than their freshman one. This seemed to have a more mature flare to it. The R&B twist was great. I liked all the songs. One was a remake of a really really old song (Just got paid). The only problem was there were not enough songs!"
2,Listened to it twice...now it's gathering dust on my desk,"*sigh* How naive was I two years ago....I thought THIS was talent. The songs get boring FAST! Heck, I remember having to CONVINCE myself to like this CD when I first had it because of my crush on JC (thank gawd that's over with too). The way they organize the songs is also attrocious. Going from a straight up dance club song like ""Brinin' Da Noise"" all the way down to a ballad like ""That's When I'll..."". WTH were they thinkin???? However, I have heard they mature in their new CD ""Celebrity."" Unfortunatly, I don't care enough to buy it."
1,utter trash,"OK, so this is me venting:I find it absolutely appalling that such mass-produced garbage can sell zillions of copies while bands with actual TALENT are struggling to make a living.I hate the fact that America's youth automatically devours everything that they are force-fed by the media. Kids are learning to buy everything that has a pretty face (or five) on the cover. How unhealthy.Here's a thought, boys: Learn to play an instrument. Or at least write your own songs. I might not like your music, but at least you'd be respectable.On the rare and unfortunate instance where I hear a ""boy band"" song, I am literally unable to determine who's singing it. *Nsync and BSB aren't musicians; they're competing products, like Coke and Pepsi."
3,not into them but some songs were alright,"this was given to me by a friend and I accepted it with a forced smile on my face cause I couldn't stand the boyband hype at the time. Sure Bye Bye Bye, Its Gonna Be Me and This I Promise You were ear candy with strong melodies but it wasn't anything worth lusting over like people my age were doing at the time(about 16 then). However I gave this a listen and the only other songs I liked on the CD in addition to the released singles were It Makes Me Ill and Space Cowboys thanks to left eye(R.I.P.), Just Got Paid was alright too though the minute I heard it I knew it had to be an 80's cover and I was right. But seriously this music is really a period piece and not a classic album at all by all means though the singles released are the only memorable ones here"
4,Gr8,"This is the only nysnc cd I've got, and i hafta say it is good. bye bye bye is an awesome hit. This I promise u is sweet. The rest of the songs are pretty good 2!"
3,This I promise you,"I'm not really a NSync fan...but I have to admit after hearing ""This I promise you"" on the radio day in and day out.. I totally fell in love with it. It is so good that I have decided to use it as my wedding song for my wedding in December this year."
1,Too bad it can't go further than ONE.,"NSYNC - ugh. When will people get TIRED of this? It's pure MANUFACTURED pop, and the stuff they wrote, they didn't write entirely. The lyrics were weak and cliche.If you want something REAL - go listen to HANSON. They are real and talented. Something RARE in the music market now."
2,What was i thinking?,"I have no clue why i bought this cd, obviously the pop stage. If u don't like this cd i am fo sho U won' t Like CelebrityYuck"
5,N'sync is the best group in the world!,N'sync's new CD is the best CD in the world. The songs are all very well sung(including the one acapella song) and the tunes are great. It's fabulous and you must buy it! It makes the Backstreet Boys look horrible. I love it!
5,A MUST HAVE CD!,"This CD shows *NSYNC's growth from their first album to their newest release. JC Chasez or Justin Timberlake co-wrote 5 out of the 12 songs. From the slow ballad, ""This I Promise You"", to the jam, ""Space Cowboy (Yippie-Yi-Yay)"", (which features a rap by Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes), shows much growth and maturity. *NSYNC has shown me and everyone else that they are for real...so go buy this CD NOW! You'll regret not buying it!"
2,It's Ok but not as good as the other one,"I was really excited for this cd to come out, but when i got it today, i realized how bad it is. All the songs sound the same. There's only 3 good songs on it: Bye Bye Bye, Space cowboy, and This I promise you. The rest is just the same songs over and over with different words. But dont take my word on it. Go listen to it for yourself. All you *NSYNC fans that are writing great stuff about the cd, when you know it's bad, that's just pathetic. THE CD IS TERRIBLE"
1,Not Worth Your Money!,"First things first, I really liked NSync's first CD, and yes, you could say that I was a fan. But their 2nd CD is a HUGE downfall. It lacks originality and inspiration. NSYNC seems to be straining. NSYNC just don't fit the RAP/Hipp Hop image that they are going for (obviously). The only songs worth hearing are BYE BYE BYE and THIS I PROMISE YOU. Other than that, stay away from this CD.Obviously, unlike the BSB who HAS TALENT AND ORIGINALITY, NSYNC is fan based by those 10-17 year old girls. All NSYNC wants to strive for is to get a certain RESPECT and win over the BSB by album sells. They will be remembered for their FAN-BASED album sells but not their TRUE TALENTS. They have NO talent whatsoever.If you want to hear some good music, check out Backstreet Boys' 'Millenium' or NSYNC's FIRST album. They are much much better. Only wild fans who don't care about the CD's content would get this junk CD!"
2,Disappointed,"This CD has some high points. The first time that I hear it I was going to review it with a 0 (God forgive me). But I listened to it again today and I must say it improved. Some of these tracks I couldn't even bear to listen to. However the ballads are these mens strong point. In this CD I see an attempt at acceptance and credibiltiy that they do not achieve. They became mega stars through dance pop and while I understand that they had to branch out this CD went from pop to two years later rock-ish. I thought that the first single, ""Bye Bye Bye"" was promising, and what I heard of ""This I Promise You"" was great before I bought it. The last three tracks are some of the best of this CD- only half of it is bearable. BsB branched out without losing their roots and it made for a great second effort while 98 Degrees did the same. Both of their second efforts were successful but I don't think NSYNC will have that off the music of this CD. Its just not as good as the first time around."
1,Can you say CACA?,THIS HAS TO BE THE LAMEST AND WORST ALBUM OF THE YEAR. ALL N'SNYC HAS ARE THERE STUPID LOOKS. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
5,It was a GREAT CD!!,I love *N Sync!! There the best. I think that they did a REALLY good job on it. You should buy the CD and you will be impressed!! So get a going buy it!!
3,N Sync's New Style,"Actually this is a totally new style for the group. I give them props for being different but I cannot say that I 100% like the change. I like how the songs are funkier but I can't say that I actually like every song on the cd. After listening to the whole cd, my favorite is 'It Makes Me Ill' I also like 'This I Promise You', 'It's Gonna Be Me' and 'No Strings Attached'. The 'Digital Get Down' was a surprise but a pleasant one. All in all this album is pretty good but not overall comparable with Backstreet Boys. I liked every song on 'Millenium'"
4,Surprisingly good...,"I am one of those people who easily dismiss boy bands. I'm in an older demographic (24), in a top tier law school, and cynical. I even went so far as to tell my little sister (14) that I would eat dirt before I liked any of her listening material.But then I heard NSync on 106.1, an urban station that serves the Bay Area. The station played ""It Makes Me Ill"", and while some listeners objected to the station playing the song, many more requested that the song be replayed. I have to say, I'm in the majority. I borrowed the cd from a friend, and most of the tracks are equally tight.Congratulations, gentlemen. Well done! I guess I'm going to have to chow down on some mud pies after all...:)"
3,Not Bad,"I found about 3 great tracks. The rest was typical boy-bandish stuff that I promptly skipped over on my 2nd listen. In short, not a complete waste of money."
3,What will Backstreet boys do next? Rock?,Only 3 songs really got me going. The rest wasn't so great. I also think that justin and j.c should just pair up because their the only ones who I hear singing..the rest r just like backups. I think they could do better.
4,"Good Boys Turn Bad, (in a Good way!)","I'm sick of everyone saying that these guys blew it this time around. 'NSYNC has finally decided to break away from their fluffy ""boy band"" image and, for the most part, have been successful. The song No Strings Attached is a rockin' track, and I Thought She Knew is probably one of the best slow songs I've ever heard, period. If you're in to heavier, digital pop, go for No Strings Attached!"
1,I thought it was gonna be good,"I got up early in the morningto get this cd,and I shouldn't have.They said it was a growth it wasn't! The songs are immater and so are they.This cd was just a waste of my money"
1,I used to like it!,"I used to like this album so much. When released it had much publicity and it was pushed and pushed and I loved ""Bye, Bye, Bye"" and ""It's Gonna Be Me"" but two years later it sounds extremely dated and you cringe whenever you hear any of those songs. This album sold 2.4 millions copies in it's first week and understandably so but just like other boy Bands like New Kids On The Block and the Backstreet Boys there music becomes dated and is only for nostalgia. Now that the Teen bubble has burst, I don't think they will be around for much longer."
1,not really a review just an observation.,"ive already written a review on this horrible album, but is it just me or nsync lost a lot of their popularity, it seems like some of their ""fans"" have got on the hard rock band wagon because its becoming more popular. In my book none of the music today can ever be as good as the 60's and 70's music. you may not like it but deep down you know its true."
1,WORSE CD EVER MADE IN HISTORY,"YO, THIS CD TOTALLY SUX. I HATE BOY BANDS AND THEIR MUSIC. ITS JUST BORING AND STUPID AND IT SUX!!!!!! LISTEN, IF YOU WANT TO TRY SOME MUSIC THAT IS INTERESTING AND HAS TALENT, TRY DEFTONES, KORN, LIMP BIZKIT, OR EMINEM. THIS IS THE WORSE CD EVER MADE IN HISTORY AND ANNOYS ME EVERY TIME I HEAR A SONG FROM THIS BAND."
2,MY REVIEW ON NO STRINGS ATTACHED,"This is an okay album. There are some good songs, okay songs, and just plain bad songs(digital get down) If NSYNC your thing, you should get this album, if not and you want to get a pop album get BSB."
5,Review for *Nsync's No Strings Attached,"This group definitely redefines the meaning of ""teen pop"". The tracks on this CD range from contagious fast-beated tunes to slow songs that portray the power and the love that these guys have for their music. This is just about the only vocal group that i have heard that sounds the way they do on stage as on this CD. Forget about the Backstreet Boys! *Nsync is the best!"
1,garbage to the max,"Yuck. My brother got this Cd and my hands had a new use, covering my ears. I don't get why everyone likes this Cd. Avoid it at all costs"
1,"i wish they would go bye,bye,bye","My ears bleed whenever I hear a song from ""No Strings Attached""- The songs sound the same- BBB, IGBM, BDN,- all uptempos except for maybe 2 or 3 ballads. ""This I Promise You"" is a good song- but that's all it is- just a typical love song. Don't bother buying this CD- Nsync is on TV 24/7 nowadays- just turn the tube on- and you'll hear them and see them."
4,Not a bad buy,"Out of the top three boy bands, I would characterize 98* as having the most talent, Backstreet Boys as being the best looking, and N'Sync as singing the most addictive songs. Though almost all the songs are sung by either Justin or JC, you won't get sick of the songs. There are a lot more fast songs on this CD than there are slow songs. However, the CD's not arranged in such a way that after a while all the songs sound the same. The only two songs that bothered me were Space Cowboy, and I thought she Knew. The first one bothers me only for the rap part. While it wasn't as bad as it could have been, the rapping was pretty dumb. The reasons I have for not liking I Thought She Knew are that (1) N'sync sucks at a capella (2) What other boy band recently released a CD on which the last track is a capella? (98*. N'sync copied that idea!) Overall, I would say that this is a good buy. Bravo!"
5,The Best Yet1,"This CD is N'SYNC's best yet! They did such a great job on it and it rocks! Hope you enjoy it, it's definatly something to buy!"
5,LUV IT!,"i absolutly luved this CD! this is a must-have for any *NSYNC fan! i read that thing that Editorial Review and it made me so mad! GGGRRR! HOW CAN THEY SAY THAT *NSYNC WILL ME LONG FORGOTTEN WHEN THE BACKSTREETS BOY'S CD COMES OUT! *NSYNC IS HERE TO STAY! WITH ALL THESE HARD FANS, YOU DARE TO SAY THAT THEY WILL BE GONE! you just sit back and watch them FLY OFF THE CHARTS! TO ALL~ KEEP FAITH IN *NSYNC! THEY ARE TRULEY GIFTED. GOD BLESS."
4,No Strings Attached pulls a fast one.....,"No Strings Attached pulls a fast one.... straight to the dance floor! N'Sync's follow up CD to their smash self-titled first CD proves that N'Sync has what it takes to survive in the jungle of the rock world. 'No Strings Attached' has jumpin' tunes you can kick your heels up (Bye,Bye,Bye, Space Cowboy & Bringin'Da Noise) as well as demonstrating their versatility in talent with the harmonius acapella ""I Thought She Knew"". Justin Timerlake and JC Chasez prove they are no reincarnation of Jordan Knight and Joe McIntyre of New Kids on the Block by introducing a new ""flavor"" of tunes that only N'Sync can create. The songs and their beats will keep your body moving and your feet dancing while your ears absorb melodic pleasure for over 45 minutes! If Backstreet Boys new CD is anything like the sleepy 'Millennium' that had only a few tunes that jammed, then N'Sync will continue in their glory as the official successors to the dethroned New Kids on the Block."
2,Not worth it,"I bought this cd a week after it came out since I love the song Bye Bye Bye. The cd though, is one I could say Bye, Bye, Bye to. To be honest, I haven't heard the whole thing. I couldn't bring myself to. I listened to the first 7 or 8 songs and couldn't take anymore. The only songs I ever listen to are the first 2 tracks. I would recommend this cd to any diehard NSYNC fans or people with a high tolerance for boy bands. As for myself, give me a good Jewel cd anyday."
3,"Wow, I've never heard a nastier song than Digital Getdown..","...and that really turned me off to the CD. Ugh! That was completely uncalled for..... I shudder whenever I hear it. However, there are some good songs on the CD- such as Bye Bye Bye (though the music video attracted me to the song much more than the actual song did), It's Gonna Be Me (whose upbeat rhythm keeps you moving), and That's When I'll Stop Loving You (which has some nice harmony and lyrics). Overall, this CD isn't too great, but there are some songs worth listening to...."
1,This is stupid,"*N Sync is the stupidest group I have ever heard. All their songs are idiotic and annoying. ""Bye Bye Bye"" is the worst song ever(Not as bad as anything by Britney Spears). I can't believe that people actually like this stuff. Most people my age have really bad taste. All these stupid boy bands sing about is love and all their songs sound the same. I would suggest buying some REAL music by someone like Eminem."
3,Slapping the teenyboppers with the other side of love.,"I only like half of the songs on this album, but I think it's a refreshing change from the onslaught of sappy love-sick songs that the miriad of boybands have been singing the past few years. The beats are hard, and seem to bring out a darker sense in the guys. It's no surprise that I'm reading a ton of negative reviews for this album...the poor teenyboppers aren't being sweeped off their feet with romantic words; instead they're being slammed to the ground with verses that basically sum up to say ""I'm sick of putting up with you."" To each his/her own with this album. This will make a perfect collection to those not-so-happy love moments in your life. Trust me, you'll enjoy the investment then."
1,Can I have my money back please???,"What the heck??? Why are they talking about being a space cowboy?? Oh yeah, that 'a capella' at the end . . . sounds as if they are slaughtering an animal. Throughout the song, all I kept thinking was, 'stop, stop with the animal killing!' And one more thing, I thought they were a group--5 guys singing and sharing songs, BUT the whole cd was like JC, and the blonde curly haired dude, uh, what's his name?? not important-- oh wait, Justin. It was like JC and Justin's album, with some vocal assistance from the other not so well-known members for the group. It's just an annoying CD. I like NSYNC, but this could've been a better CD."
1,A piece of junk. Period.,"My sister has this CD. Not a sound made by these so called men sounds close to good. With so many people working on this CD you would think they could make something good, not just some teeny bopping hype that ten year olds will buy just to fit in. I don't care how hot Steve or whatever that guy's name is, it is complete junk, when will the suffering end? Listen to whatever you want to, just stop throwing money at these huge corporations bent on taking exploiting you or your children, buy some Hanson or something, at least hey write their own music."
1,True to its name in an instrumental sense,"I listen to teen pop only because my 11-going-on-12-year-old sister does, but it's too pumping for me, and it's just plain UGH on this instrumentally-true-to-its-name album by N'Sync, which sold almost 3 million copies in its FIRST week of release. Boring. The only song I like on there is ""I'll Be Good For You."" Otherwise, the whole album stinks."
1,No Talent and Boring,"I was a kid when this came out and didn't like it then. My opinion hasn't changed. The only decent songs are the first 2. I think the song ""Digital Get Down"" is very creepy for a pre-teen to listen to, and that's the age group this band was supposed to be marketing to. That song bothered me at that age."
1,Ok...,"This kind of processed pop makes my stomach crawl. It is simply impossible to use N'Sync and variety in the same sentence.This has got to be songs that were left over from the last album. If they wanted to keep the fans from the last album by staying with the same sound, they have done that. The song titles even show that this is essentialy the same album as before and as before only two of the five members sing! By way of comparison, The Backstreet Boys song ""Show Me the Meaning..."" features ALL FIVE members singing solo at some point! And the comparisons don't end there. The five part harmony of BSB is far superior, N'Sync's sounds a little muddled and sometimes sound off key!I guess, to make up for these short comings, the ""Bye,Bye,Bye"" music video had to be made into a mini-movie because the song was lacking!Welcome to the new age of the bubblegum popstar. God have mercy!"
4,back off old people!,"ok... why are all you old people reviewing this? this is a song for young people, you are just a bunchs old fogies who have nothing better to do than stick your nose into your kids buisness and come trash there songs. the song digital get down is a kewl, up beat one to keep you moving. while this isn't ment for 7 year olds, they will find it out about this type of stuff anyway, and you should just stop dissin stuff becuase you think your kids have virgin ears. sorry, but I can almost guarenty that they don't. you have to let them grow up!"
2,School Daze,Justin needs to take some of his money and go back to school (see HIS review above). He is apparently incapable of forming a coherent written sentence and hasn't a clue what to do with punctuation. The CD is OK (barely).
2,So-So,"It wasn't the best... it's a totally different flava than their last album but it's all right. However, I was disappointed w/ some of the songs. And the whole album sounds really computerized. There are a lot of up-beat songs and barely any slow songs so it's not possible to be able to hear their true talent because you hear more talent when it's a slow song. Either ways, it was just OK, not my personal fave thou."
1,My boy dog agrees with me.,"My dog is smarter than your average dog. Probably smarter than you fart monkey, brainless morons who love this cd. I showed him the cd after playing all the songs one time each. My dog threw up most of the time the cd was playing. Other times he was busy pooping all over the cd player. I took the cd out and asked him if it was worth keeping. He lifted his right back leg high into the air and peed all over it!"
3,BoyBand I think so,"Nsync is a very talented Boyband, and I like the feel of this album but come on boys lets see what is up your sleeves and pull out something that can be a legend something I would still listen to in 10 years. BYE BYE BYE...Good break up song but gets annoying after hearing it over and over...Come up with a song that doesnt get annoying such as the one song on your album Ill be good for you. Now that is a song I could hear over and over hell I do listen to it over and over."
4,No Strings Attached is almost there,"This album is almost there with Millennium by the Backstreet Boys. NSync's best selling album is this one. They make those songs sound pretty good. Like ""Bye Bye bye"" and ""It's gonna be me"". However, they don't have that many years of experience to make a classic boy band album. The song ""I thought she knew"" was not that good compared to ""I'll never break your heart"". They need to show some growth and write their own songs! (I do mean all five of them!!). Their dancing moves are very good, that I admit. So NSync got some work to do if they want to be at the top of the pyramid."
4,CD Review,"Only ""Bye Bye Bye"" was a good song in it. All the other lyrics were not so good. This makes me think of buying a BS Boys cd instead. I think that they are hot, new, and popular is helping them getting along. I think that it's right that if good bands last a long time like this one. But once a couple of years gone by and they don't look so hot, popular, especially new they'll begin to fade. All I'm saying is that they will last a very long time but not forever. All songs are good but not great but I still urge you all to try it out and buy it. I have my own opinion and you have yours. I'll stick with them for awhile. BS Boys just gotta get another album out quick or they gonna be faded away soon, but this band will live on and last awhile!"
4,NSYNC WHO?,"There is no NSYNC, its all Justin 'n' JC. Take my advice, Lance, Joey and, Chris. Go start your own group. Justin and JC will just get new backup singers. The music was okay, but I was hoping to hear them all sing, at least a line."
5,Good CD!,"I am a huge *NSYNC fan and was in no way dissapointed when I got this CD. True, the lyrics may not be as ""in depth"" as some critics would like it to be, but the songs contain good beats, and to simply put it, they're fun. The songs may take some getting used to, but they will grow on you if you just give them a chance. So if your looking for a CD that contains songs that will sing to you the meaning of life, you got the wrong CD, but if your looking for a CD that is enjoyable and fun to listen to, which is something I look forward to in this hectic world, then I highly recomend this CD."
3,Good for 2000,"Based on hits ONLY, this album would get 4-5 stars. ""Bye, Bye, Bye"" and ""Its Gonna Be Me"" are infectious, and the album maintains a funky, danceable beat until track 6. After that it starts winding down. The acappella track only shows off their talent for singing wildly high notes in a girly manner (aka Chris/Justin) while songs like ""i'll be good for you"" and ""digital get down"" should never have made the cut. This album was good for 2000, and nsync brought about a more uptempo sound into boybands. Nonetheless, the boyband phase is over, would NOT have fared as well nowadays. 3 stars overall."
1,"Thank god they're ""BYE, BYE, BYE""","NSYNC had to have been one of the worst boy bands in history, maybe even the worst.I mean seriously, who wants to hear a song that says bye bye bye a million times? I guarantee that just about every person who ever bought their CDs through them in the trash years ago.The best boy band that ever came along had to have been 98 degrees. Not one of their songs was ever as bad as ""bye, bye, bye."""
1,..................,*yawn* this is complete garbage. certainly nothing special. i honestly dont understadn how they got famous.
4,One great album,"Wow! I was really suprised when I first heard ""No Strings Attached"" and to be truthful I was a little scared. It wasn't what were expecting, but it was the good music they promised. They let us see a little into them. I think that's really brave. Also, they've grown up alot and this album really shows it. Sure, not every song is their best, but if you don't like a song, don't listen to it. We, as fans, have to let them be true to themselves.I, for one, love the album. If you don't like it be a BSB fan! 'N Sync 4 Ever! <lovin' lance>"
2,'N Sync doesn't have N'y talent,"It pains me to realize what the music world is coming to. 'N Sync represents everything that is wrong with the music industry. I remember a time when ""bands"" didn't have to dance around on stage lip syncing. Back in the good old days, band members actually played instruments and wrote their own music. (See the Rolling Stones, the Who, the Beatles, Queen, Led Zeppelin, etc.)With their second album ""No Strings Attached,"" 'N Sync provides more of their trademark: synthesized, danceable pop tunes. Musically, it's nothing special, but MTV propoganda should help it achieve multi-platinum status.There's a big difference between trendy music and good music, and No Strings Attached is clearly just trendy. If trendy is your style, then go ahead and buy this, but five years from now you'll be asking yourself, ""What was I thinking?"" Just ask your older sister about ""Hangin' Tough"" by New Kids on the Block."
1,POP SUX,POP BANDS SUCK! THEY HAVE NO TALENT AND COMPLETLY REALY ON SYNTHESISERS. POP SUX (U KNOW WHO U ARE) POP SUX (U KNOW WHO U ARE) POP SUX (U KNOW WHO U ARE) POP SUX (U KNOW WHO U ARE) POP SUX (U KNOW WHO U ARE) POP SUX (U KNOW WHO U ARE) POP SUX (U KNOW WHO U ARE)ROCK KIXX ROCK KIXX ROCK KIXX ROCK KIXX ROCK KIXX ROCK KIXX ROCK KIXX ROCK KIXX ROCK KIXX ROCK KIXX ROCK KIXX ROCK KIXX
1,"This has so many strings attached, its not even funny...","Ok, ""Bye, Bye, Bye"" and ""Its Gonna Be Me"" are ok, but their voices on all of these are so computerized you can tell! Plus, there are only 3 slow songs, and they're all bunched up near the end. All of the songs sound the same. The music is too digital. If you like their first CD, you will hate this. Too upbeat for me, I'd listen to Britney Spears over this. The only reason this got so many good reviews is because they are *NSYNC. Not because they sound good. Plus, if you have this, listen to the song 'Digital Getdown'. Its about cybersex. Not for little kids, if you are a parent. PEACE, y'all! :-)"
1,The Truth Exposed!,"Nsync does not sing. They whine. The whine in that nasaly tone. No Strings Attached is a phoney account of a boys undeniable love for another girls (or boys) yearning. (isn't that what all the songs are about?). Love has many faces and an innumerable and immeasureable degree of facets to explore. Nsync does not delve into the depths of love, they skim the surface in a disposable kind of way, rehashing the same love games and going through the motions over and over until we all had enough. One dimentional in it's approach, will No Strings Attached be an album that will defy the unforgiving course of longevity? No. With such remakes as Johnny Kemp's ""Just got Paid"", and a slew of other monotone embelishments, Nsync fail to hold a note, even if dropped in a bucket. Style tries to sing but style is fleeting. Good music lives forever. Nsync is style."
5,Crunked Up For The New Blbum,"I am EXTREMLY impressed by the new album. I went to the store half after midnight to purchase this album and listened to ths album for the following six hours. N'sync has trulsy elavated to the next level with there new CD.You see more of the arists flavor and personalities!They have long lost the sterotype of ""the boy band"".More of a hipper,up beat,and with a twist of a party mix!"
2,Not as good as it is played up to be,"I'm sorry, but after listening to NSYNC's No Strings Attached, I was very disappointed. I think that the songs are not from the heart or thought-provoking at all. It is phony and will not last. It is more about sound-effects instead of good songs and subjects. I think that the CD is dumb and I will never understand what the fuss was about. Sorry to compare, but the Backstreet Boys' music is a lot better. I really don't like NSYNC's ""No Strings Attached"" CD."
1,youre_never_right can drink napalm,"[Read the following backwards to understand it]Os ouy era dalg Dime si daed? Fi uoy t'nera gnikoj, uoy nac og kcuf flesruoy! I hsiw nahtan elag tohs UOY daetsni!!![done]As for N'suck, yeah, they blow. Pop sucks! It's all abut metal, industrial, [good] alternative, grunge, punk, and old-school rap."
1,they are terrible,this is the worst album i have ever heard...this shouldn't even be considered music..if you want to hear some real music pick up one of micheal jackson's albums...he is a true musician
2,My daughter thinks their all that! But?,"I've heard preview and so much on this album, but I'm sorry this album ""sucks"". Their first album ""was"" and ""is"" way better than this one! My daughter dis-agrees with me, but to me this album will be saying ""Bye, Bye, Bye"" in the future to come (soon)!"
2,Corny CD with no talent or thought put into it,"Sure some memebers of *N Sync writes some songs on the CD and they beat Backstreet Boys' high debut number. Either way, the songs are corny and it sounds as if their voice didn't improve any. This is a terrible sophmore album but for their time and effort and the legal case they had to go through during the production of the CD, I'm giving it two stars. Still, don't waste your money, download the MP3 instead."
1,Very bad CD,"*N SYNC's second attempt at a CD once again falls short. This CD lacks anything unique and is nothing to get excited over. If you are a die-hard fan, go ahead and buy it, but those who aren't into the whole ""boy band"" thing, stay clear of this one."
3,"Catchy, but hollow.","The tracks on this album are catchy, I'll admit. It is obvious that the band has matured since their last album, but most of the songs still consist of gibberish and forgetfull lyrics. It does, however, have some good variety. The songs are also adequate party/dance tunes. The band does, still, seem like one-hit wonders (especially to young teens), hopefully they'll mature more and evolve. But I guess with these kind of album sales, it doesn't matter.Overall, catchy tunes with good beats, and sloppy written lyrics."
1,It's quite sad...,"Our teenage society has reached a new low. 'N Sync has slipped into the always sad category of self-parody. The album is called ""No Strings Attached,"" While they are the epitome of corporate puppets, a fact that is obviously oblivious to them. I am a 15 year old male, so I am around a large percent of the peppy teenage girls who listen to this drivel, and they have my pity. By wasting their time on the untalented, ignorant, immature ""band"" who makes this stuff, they miss out on a lot of beautiful music. If you wish to escape the fridge buzzings that these little boys, ahem, ""co-wrote"" listen to some Radiohead, or old Pearl Jam, or Moby, or Portishead. But for your own sake, stay away from this. Agree? Dissagree? E-mail me at OKairbag97@aol.com"
1,"1 star, of course thats from a guy","Chicks are just way to into nsync and bsb and 98 degrees, lfo, etc., they all are the same, I think that they should all join a single group and call themselves the bendover boys. cause they are all obviously gay and haven't any talent in them at all. They're only so popular because those girls who buy there cds got bored of doing dirty things with their ken and barbie dolls and wanted something new to play with.Well anyways, nsync= no talent. don't buy cd, if your a guy or a girl. just listen to me. unless your one of those barbie girls. the only good song on the cd is its gonna be me. THe rest, well it seems like they don't try to rhyme or make good lyrics at all, they just produced a cool beat and then just talked normally with no rhythm or rhyming or anything that even the bsb or 98 degrees could've done with such a kickin' beat, so they get 1 star"
5,A little surprising,"While I'm an *NSync fan, even I didn't expect this from them. These guys really have talent. They obviously aim to please in this album, where they definitely have a nice blend of songs, ranging from dance to techno-ish to a pleasant a capella. I think the more someone listens to this cd, the more they'll like it. The effort that *NSync put into this cd is apparent in its high quality and originality."
5,Solid Gold,I think this is the greatest cd I have heard in a very long time. I think it is solid gold. I love the boys they are great.
4,*N Sync Cuts the Strings,"*N Sync's sophomore album No Strings Attached will not disappoint any true blue *N Sync fan. Its funky beats and R&B influenced base lines might even be capable of converting stubborn boy-band haters. Hot tracks like ""Digital Get Down"" and ""It Makes Me Ill"" break from the traditional boy-band sound of polished pop. The boys' artistic influences are much more strongly felt on this album then on their debut album. They have proven that they have the raw talent needed to continue having successful careers. There is definitely room for growth here, but there is no doubt that *N Sync is worthy of their commercial success. We can expect them to only get better with time and experience."
5,No Strings Attached: The Hottest CD ever!,"This CD is the best yet from 'Nsync. I recommend that everyone buy this cd. You will love it. Especially the songs ""Its Gonna Be Me"" and ""Digital Get Down"". I love the CD And you will too."
4,hmmmmm,"Well i dunno what all u guys are talkin about, this cd bringsout a whole new form of nsync. they left there old style and went atottally different way. I mean they still added a few of the slower slongs where they try and show off justin and jc's superb skills. They even give joey a little solo which doesn't happen much. But ""makes me ill"" is like so feakin tight! im a 15 year old male, but i think the acapella piece was great....i wish my talents were near that good. but hey im still hopin. well i think overall the cd was great we could use a little more of chris's extreme falcetto. but jc and lance really have good voices and they need to be used. Overall the cd's great"
1,BYE BYE BYE......AND GOOD RIDDENCE!!!,"N sync, Backstreet Boys, 98 Degrees. Why do this all sound familiar? Oh yeah now I remember. New Kids on the Block ten years ago. Yeah they had some hits themselves but after their third album bombed, they was never heard from again. Do these boy bands today have any idea how bad they sound? I guess a producer can do just about anything when they turn the music all the way up and the vocals down. When the sappy bubble gum music die out (AGAIN), are these no talented-can't sing-no instrument playing, dancing morons going to wake up and smell the coffee? I guess we won't know until two years from now...when they're on VH1's Behind the Music, Where are they now?...or the E True Hollywood Stories."
2,WHY the record sales !,hey NSYNC you maybe going up the charts but you need to be more mature on your songs ! and stop trying so hard ! BSB & Westlife got my vote !
2,what happened?,"I was REALLY disappointed when I found out that ""Somewhere, Someday"" and ""Only Through Heaven's Eyes"" weren't on this cd. Those two songs are really beautiful ballads that show NSYNC's true talent... I like the song ""This I Promise You"", but it lacked the quality of ""Somewhere..."" and ""Only Through..."" ""Bye Bye Bye"" is a catchy song but it gets old REALLY FAST... The rest of the songs are so computerized and they all have this annoying wannabe-techno sound. Well, I know that NSYNC is going to make even more money when they come out with an import album with the only really good songs- ""Somewhere..."" and ""Only Through..."" I am a 14 year old girl so don't get me wrong here, I'm not some anti-pop-music person... I just don't consider this that great... but no one will listen to what I say... all the die-hard fans would still buy this cd even if it was just blank airtime... All I can say is that for me, it's ""byebyebye"" to NSYNC..."
2,Needs Work.,"Now don't get me wrong, I like N'SYNC, and some of these songs are good. But alot of these songs were a big disapointment, and I did not like the rap songs at all. Plus, what happened to ""Music Of The Heart(From ""Music Of My Heart),"" and ""Somewhere Someday (From ""Pokemon: The First Movie)?"" If these songs were on this CD, it would have been a lot better. Still buy this CD if you're a die-hard N'SYNC fan. But if you just like some of their songs, this CD might make you glum."
4,Put this into your shopping cart,This is a great CD with a bunch of hip-hop and dancing tracks. It will get you up on your feet in no time. No Strings Attached also really showcases their fine musical talent. A must-have for any N'Sync or non N'Sync fan. Congratulations to the group on a job well done.
2,Keep trying N' Sync,"N' Sync's new album is definitely many steps behind their debut album... proving that this boy band lacks the talent that other bands like the Backstreet Boys and 98 Degrees have. The major quality lacking in this album is a solid ballad... the ones on the album are decent, but not worth hearing over again. The album's saving grace is their hit ""Bye, Bye, Bye"" and another song with a great beat: ""Gotta Be Me."" Nevertheless, think twice before buying."
2,The First was Better,"Okay, I don't think this CD is all that great. I mean it's okay. It has a couple good songs but the rest stink and sound like they tried to copy their first album. And I waited all that time for nothing!You think since they stalled the debut of the album that it'd be good. Too bad it's not!No I'm not a 50 year old who hates pop music and listens to Bruce Springsteen all day. I'm a teen and usually listens to Pop music.Sorry N'Syncers! It's just not all that that!"
3,No What it was made out to be,"I was disapointed with this album! I am A HUGE fan of nsync and have been since their first album wich I LOVE but now with No Stings Attached I am begening to wonder why. They music itself is good but the message is lost! I guess I just don't hear the heart that I herd with the first album. I, like most nsync fan bought the album the day it came out(I had it reserverd) but I must say I was shocked to say the least with the album! What a change! You have them first sining Crazy For You (from thier first album) then Digital Get Down! I like the image they had when they started! Clean, but still music you could dance to! Now it seems all they are trying to convey is sex and partying I just hate to see another wonderful talented band go to waste! Anyway over all it's a great ""music"" cd but the lyrics and soul leave a lot to be desired!"
4,An Awesome Follow Up Album,"This album is absolutely awesome! It is ten times better than they're debut. Even if you didn't like the first one, chances are you'll like this one. I especially liked ""Its Gonna Be Me"" and ""It Makes Me Ill"". Both have an awesome beat to them and great vocal performances. And the a capella of ""I Thought She Knew"" is an awesome way to end the album. It really shows what great vocalists the guys are. I'd say the only real downside to this C.D. are two songs. ""That's When I'll Stop Loving You"" is too generic, too boring and too long. And ""Digital Get Down"" well, let me just say that I was apalled and disgusted when I heard it. They shouldn't be doing songs like that, especially with so many young kids that look up to them. Its horrible, badly written and too graphic. Its really a shame that they did it, because the rest of the album is awesome."
2,Nothing great,"I never liked all these little boy bands and I never will. I don't think I'll ever know why so many people love N sync. Yeah they're cute but what else? Some of their songs are okay, like ""Its gonna be me,"" but the other ones i'm sick of! Like, after hearing ""Bye Bye Bye"" three times I never wanted to listen to it again! I'm soooooooo sick of these guys. The only 2 other decent songs on the cd are ""This I promise you"" and ""digital get down."" Other than that, i dont know!"
2,Amazon was Right! 'Nysnc Isn't as good as they should be!,"I am totally agree w/the Editorial Review, 'nysnc isn't as good as Backstreet boy in terms of voice and their songs' topics are lame! ""Ditigal"", and some R&B wannabe.... COM'on! give me a break! ""This I promise you"" is the only acceptable song among the rest. I was planning to download their mp3 songs on the web (for a sampling purposes ONLY of course) but u know what, their ""talent"" just killed my interest. I think they invent the best way to kill free music downloading - bad talent and lame songs!"
2,The New N'Sync Album,"My daughter recently received the new N'Sync album, ""No Strings Attached"", and she loves it. I'm not so sure I can say the same, however. The music sounds like it is more geared towards pre-teens and teenagers. I agree with the person on"
1,Nsync better than bsB !,"Not in a million years. My friend Marketta bought the cd and I borrowed it. There were a few good songs but you cant compare any of the songs to Backstreet Boys ""I want it that way"". The songs on ""Millennium"" were songs that adults and young people alike can enjoy. Anyways BsB isnt selling out like Nsync, Nsync has a movie to do, McDonalds commercial and now according to MTV they are gonna have lip balm. Does this remind you of the Spice Girls? Anyways BsB arent sellouts and if Nsync wants to last they better not worry about how much money they make and study more on music. On their next cd all the members should get solos like BsB did on theirs."
5,BEST CD EVER,"Being an NSYNC maniac, i bought no strings attached the day it released. On many cds, you like one or two songs on it, but on this cd, every song was the best!"
4,Pretty good...,"They could do better but this is one of their best CD's, you can at least check it out even if you don't like boybands. If you really dislike N'sync then obviously you aren't going to buy this CD, but you can at least try to like them, not just single them out."
3,"Eh,it's ok","I got this CD the first week it was out in March 2000.I really dug that song ""Bye Bye Bye"" and was expecting something better,but unfortunatly most of the CD was over produced garbage.Bye Bye Bye-The first single and the best song off the whole CD.It's Gonna Be Me-Eh this song is ok.I have seriously heard way better then this.Space Cowboy-Not a bad song.Lisa""Left Eye""Lopes does an amazing rap in this song.Just Got Paid-This song was recored/wrote/ever even thought of,because?Skip this one.It Makes Me Ill-A very much R+B track.One of the good R+B tracks on this CD.This I promise You-The best balad on the CD.Great vocals!!No Strings Atached-Way over produced!Not a good track at all.Bringin The Noise-Good dancable track!!if you really want this CD.Buy it used.If you want a good CD by them buy their latest release,Celebrity cuz that CD is way better then this one."
4,a good cd just not the NSYNC touch to it,This Is A good cd but it just doesnt completely have the n sync touch to it like the other cd but some of the songs of it such as.Digital getdown does have the old touch to it just with a different flavor added to it.Thats when i will stop loving you has a the completely old n sync touch to it and it is a very good song aswell as most of the cd.Some songs dont have the n sync touch to it but a good cd.I would buy it if it was me buying it again but thats just my opion.
1,embarrassing,"My family are thoroughly disgusted by the lack of talent....if they weren't made by the founder in orlando, florida (also did Backstreet boys, LFO...etc) These lip syncing irregulars remind me of Banarama...and other lip syncing sucesses....burn the CD before other girls ages 10-18 throuwup...........terrible album"
3,Nsync CD-No Strings Attached,"I was the 2nd person in line at the store I purchased this cd from, and was eager to listen to it, since the cd release was delayed twice or so. Most people said ""Yeah, this cd is awesome! You have to listen to it, it's great!"" In my opinion, they could've done better. Nsync is great, and they are in fact talented, but they only have 2-3 good songs on the entire album. Other than that, I would'nt get your hopes up ""too high."" I speak for myself and say that I am somewhat disappointed with this cd."
4,Pretty good,"I was surprised by the album after I bought it. At first I thought they were trying to replicate other peoples songs, like Destiny's Child and Michael Bolton, but the more I listen to it the more I like the sound. I really love the love songs, ""That's when I'll stop loving you"" and ""This I promise you."" ""It's gonna be me"" is a great song to really jam to. Really all the songs make you want to dance whether your out on the floor or in your car. Great CD. I think Amazon was a little critical. I am a BSB fan but I think N'Sync's new album is too diverse to even compare it to BSB. Too different talents. Buy the CD. You'll love it by the Third time you listen to it."
4,No Strings Attached,"I got their first album within a week of when it came out, and I was really excited about this one. When I first got it, I was surprised, they don't sound as teeny-bop as they did before, and believe me, it's for the better. All the songs are great. ""I Promise You"" is even better than ""God Must Have Spent"" from their last album. The only low point in this CD is ""Digital Get Down"". But besides that, this CD is surprisingly good and more mature."
1,No Strings Attached,I have listened to the entire cd and I have to say that it is very disappointing! I don't like their songs anymore.
5,its the best,"hey there peoples. its a great cd. it is my favorite cd that i have now and i have like a lot of cd's. i think n sync did a wonderful job on it and it sounds great. oh and if you 5 guys ever read this ""yall looked great on ultra sound on mtv and i love you guys."" i liked the cd so much that today i bought tickets to there concert. but unfortunaly something bad happened. i guess i will tell yall! i got on at 10:00 am and was buying the tickets and a was so happy cuz i had floor seats. i was like about to cry i was so happy. but it just so happened to take me more than 5 minutes to type all the information so it would not let me have them. and so i was there for 2 hours trying to get them. and i did finally and they were for section 345. but oh well, i the happiest person just cuz i get to go.i don't know why i told yall that story but oh well. i guess i just wanted to tell yall they are great and so is their cd. so you should buy it! laterz"
1,Oh my gosh... I would rather bash myself into insanity,"First off, I hate how all pop band singing resembles:**Yowl** **Twang** Oh BAAAABBYYYYY come back to meeeeeeee!!I looooovvvee you soooooo so muuuch **groan** **yowl** **wail**Why do people try to make a bunch of ""hot celebs"" singers? First of all, their ""dancing"" gives me the willies. You knowthat ""Space Cowboys"" song where they try to miserably immitate Cypress Hill? It is so cheesy. The front of there Cd lookes the like the guy on the far right is trying to show off his new deoderant to the guy next to him, (I don't know what their names are, thank god) and they look they are marionetts. I like punk rock, pop rock, and metel, so obviuslly this would want to chuck their stupid cd into the toilet. If you like music buy System of a Down's Toxicity or Green Day's ""International Superhits"" insted of insted of wasting your money to listen to a bunch of cowboys singing love songs.Have I made myself clear?"
3,"No Strings Attached, I don't think so","""No Strings Attached,"" the second effort of the boy band who appereared in the pop scene in 1998, show major improvement in their writing skills, vocals and overall talent. However, the album wasn't as lavish as the first and contains much more of what they call ""dirty pop."" This so called 'dirty pop' puts a downfall on the album, but does conatin catchy rythmic tunes like ""Bye, Bye Bye"" (the first single). The catchy tune is what probably bought the 2.5 million people in the first week out to buy the album and not because of their popularity or talent as a group. The ballads they supplied on this album, like ""This I Promise You"" and ""I Thought She Knew"" weren't as meaningful and allusive as the ones on their debut album. ""No Strings Attached"" is an overall 'OK album.'"
5,give it a chance,"yo, i heard this cd when i was with my girls, and i must admitt, it was pretty good. they aren't hardcore by a long shot but they're definately no angels. if ur open minded 'bout music and are willin' to listen to this, i strongly recommend."
4,These Strings Definetly Attach You,"I am a 31 year old female who was introduced to this band curtosy of my 9 and 8 year old nieces. I enjoyed thier first album, but not as much as this one. Thier sophomore album has something for everyone. I find myself dancing in my car while listening to the disc. I have had the privlidge of attending 3 of thier concerts, and they sound just as good live as on tape! Once you get past Bye, Bye, Bye..you will wan't to stay attached!"
5,Best Album of The Year!,"NSYNC'S sophmore album 'NSA' is definetly the best album of 2000. Finally you can find a catchy beat and pretty good lyrics in one CD. This is totally different from there first album because the songs actually have some more feel to them. They are no longer just sappy love songs. They have songs on the album that you could hear a mix of at a club or play at a party. Lots of boy groups stay in that lovey dovey music but NSYNC has found the proper balance of upbeat and wild, but still don't totally leave behind their wholesome image of sweet romantic music with the ballads that are featured on the album. So if you don't have NSYNC's new album, you better go out and get it, because you won't find a group that is even half as good."
5,* NSync HAS got da flow!,"I think that this album has lots of cool rythm songs that you can dance to and that are something I'll always be listining to in the discman! Some songs I like are "" Bye Bye Bye"", ""Its Gonna Be Me"", and ""This I Promise You"" but each and every song has got that same facsinating rythm that stay in your head ( which is a good thing!)"
1,sorry but these guys n stink.,i was so let down by this album their first one was ok. the lyrics are so dumb! the songs all sound alike and bye bye bye is a total rip off from the backstreet's boys song don't want you back! here i thought nsync got their own style! these guys can't even sing! i feel sorry for all the people who have bought this album. if you want good sounding voices and songs that mean something get millennium by the backstreet boys!
5,"I will never say bye, bye, bye to this cd!","I strongly recommend this cd to everyone! It has unbelievable sounds, lyrics, and songs. I believe *NSYNC has established themselves as true artists with ""No Strings Attached."" It proves all of the critics out there who believed *NSYNC were just products of a bubblegum factory wrong. Just the sales on the first day alone proves how much ""No Strings Attached"" was long-awaited. I believe it would be an incredible asset to everyone's cd collection. I love ""No Strings Attached"" and *NSYNC! Go out and buy the cd! :)"
4,Good CD..,"SOme of the tracks disappointed me on this CD...WIsh they could of put Music of my Heart and Somewhere, Someday on there...Some good dance tunes..I liked This I Promise You, Bye Bye Bye, Digital Getdown the best...Overall a decent cd for your money"
3,New sound,"I'll start out by saying that I am not a NSYNC fan. I just really like ""Bye Bye Bye"". I will say, however, that I was plesently suprised by this cd. Their sound is refreshing and upbeat and a welcome change. ""It's Gonna Be Me"" has a great beat and the vocal styling of the song sets it apart on the album. ""Just Got Paid"" is a great cover. ""It Makes Me Ill"" is probably my favorite song on the cd. It's raw and fun. The rest of the album is good too. I will however say that if you are into bubble-gum pop, you might be dissapointed. The album has an edge that was missing from their fist album. This may be due to the fact that the band had more involvment in this album. I believe that their first cd should be considered an introduction and this should go down in the books as NSYNC's first album because of all the work (writting, collaborating, producing) that they did. I belive that they have found their sound, and there is no looking back."
2,Too much hype - too little substance!,"I like good music. I don't go crazy over a band because of an over-hyped image. I listen to music for the music, period. This CD is okay but not in the league with the Backstreet Boys. As the prices of CDs keeps going higher (even though the cost of making a CD is dirt cheap), I believe that the quality of ALL the songs on a CD should go up as well. This CD has just too many filler songs that are just bland. Save your money. You should NEVER buy a CD because you like the band, you should buy a CD because you like the music on the CD."
2,Bye Bye Bye was all I liked,"Okay, I love *NSYNC, don't get me wrong, but I didn't like this album at all accep Bye Bye Bye, and the song ""Digital Getdown"", which, for your 411 is about ""Cyber Sex"" was just downright offensive. I still can't believe J.C. helped write that! Leave the bad boy image to other bands, *NSYNC, or you could loose a lot of fans!"
4,"NSync says ""Bye Bye Bye"" to Bad Reviews","NSync's latest musical effort, ""No Strings Attached"", is an example of pop music at its fun and fabulous best. With the exception of a few lapses, the CD manages to entertain a diverse audience of listeners. Smash-hit ""Bye Bye Bye"", ""It's Gonna Be Me"", ""It Makes Me Ill"", and ""No Strings Attached"" feature catchy beats and lyrics that can be easily sung along to. ""This I Promise You"" and the beautiful ""I Thought She Knew"" (which is my personal favorite) are slower, and do a wonderful job of pleasing most listeners. There are a few more formulaic songs featured on the CD such as ""Digital Get Down"" and ""Bringin' Da Noise"", and these are not as quick to please. Overall, ""No Strings Attached"" is an incredibly easy listen, and can be enjoyed by a wide range of people."
2,"Except for several songs, 'it makes me ill'...","As a teenager, I bought this album some years ago to follow the trend of 'N Sync's popularity. However, no matter how much I tried to convince myself that it was worth buying, I just could not like it. I have to admit that songs like ""Bye Bye Bye,"" ""It's Gonna Be Me,"" ""This I Promise You,"" and ""That's When I'll Stop Loving You"" sound fairly nice, and few boybands could do acapella as well as they did on ""I Though She Knew."" But what are the other tracks about? Every time I listen to the CD, I have to skip the songs for they seemed harmful to my ears.One thing I have to commend on the guys is that they wrote some tracks themselves. Although they don't sound very good, at least they were willing to create something on their own. Besides, this one sounds much better than their next album ""Celebrity."""
3,"though they are not my favorite group, the music is okay","N'Sync. Most guys hate them. Well, I don't think to highly of their music, and the fact that they have stolen half the girls away from us in 8th grade isn't that great either. Their songs are okay. That is all"
1,Unorganized and Tacky!,"This album, is just like most ""bubble gum pop"" albums. Full of sap and ""ooooo's"" and ""oh yeas"" sounding more like an orgy than a song. On most ""songs"", it sounds as though the boys are chokeing while singing, or haveing a seisure of some sort. The ""songs"" also didn't seem to sound as though they had ANY live instruments in them, as though all of the ""music"", as some wish to call it, was computer made. I found both of their albums, tacky,boring and unorganized."
5,Absolutely Incredible,"Surprisingly, all of the hype has been true. The album has been taken to ""the next level"" with a new sound that mixes pop, rap, and R&B in a way I have never heard. The ""dirty pop"" sound kept my head bouncing and the ballads were incredibly heart felt. There has been definite growth since the first album. Every track is phenomenal. You can listen without skipping a single track."
1,yup...this is crap...,"yup, this and rap are lazy people music...it's crap, because none of the music is real and the singers themselves are borderline homo-erotic...i hate it, and those who really don't care for boy band crap, will agree..i may not remember your review name, but to the person who said that you're glad that dimebag is dead...you can just take your face and shove it dog crap, 'cuz dimebag was what real talent was in the industry...and one more Avril Lavigne 4-star review, and I'll toss my cookies..."
1,What the...,"I think this pretty much sums up the similarities of NSYNC's music. In other words, ALL THEIR SONGS SOUND EXACTLY THE SAME. Here is my example: We were on a long drive to New Hampshire. My dad put on NSYNC, and I fell asleep. I awoke, and I thought I WAS LISTENING TO THE SAME SONG."
1,Dissapointed!,"After seeing all the commotion that Nsync arose I expected NSA to be better. I bought this CD for my niece and I listened to the whole thing and I wanted to skip every song. I thought that if I listened to it a couple more times that the songs would grow on me. BIG MISTAKE! The songs began to annoy me even more. I think they tried too hard to distance themselves from the ""boy band"" sound that they forgot what real music sounds like. The songs are too digitalized you can't hear their real voices and the songs begin to sound repetitive. Some of the songs are even innapropriate like ""Digital get down."" The only song I really liked was ""Bye...,"" but now that one is beginning to annoy me. Even my niece, who is a really big Nsync fan, only likes about four songs on the album. Bottom line- NOT worth buying."
1,BLAH YUCK SO NOT GOOD!!!!!!!!!,"I got this c.d. because my friends said it would be awesome, but i regreat buying it! i like bye, bye, bye but other than that the c.d. is going bye bye bye...let's face it..BSB ARE SO MUCH BETTER!"
2,Disappointed,I didn't like very many songs on this CD - I was really expecting more and so were my kids. Thank goodness for CD players - we can skip to the 3 songs we do like.
4,Taking over,N Sync's finally come into there own with this album. Great catchy releases have put them above the bland Backstreet Boys. They've made their own formula for success on this album instead of mimicking what the overly cocky Backstreet Boys did with their albums. These guys can actually sing while the Backstreet Boys simply can't. It's like comparing Spears and Christina---N Sync and Christina are just simply better than either of these minimally talented acts.
2,My Review,"Classics (expect to hear these on the radio for years to come): Bye Bye Bye, It's Gonna Be Me.Flavor Of The Week Hits (don't expect to hear it again once the single after it is released): This I Promise You.Should-have-been-hits: None.Never-should-have-been-created crap: That's When I'll Stop Loving You, Digital Get Down."
1,Wow! I love McDonalds music!,"can I get a happy meal with this CD?? Pleeeze! NSync is the symbol of the fall of America. Mass Produced music is ""in"" these days, so what more can I say? Long live Britney Spears and N""Sync! long live the priviledged! Super Size my order, and i will have Sumner Redsto-- fries with that TEE HEE!!"
4,NSYNC HAS A HIT HERE,Probably one of their best. A good sophomore CD with various styles such as the bubblegum BYE BYE BYE and IT'S GONNA BE ME. They sure do work the ballads THIS I PROMISE YOU and THAT'S WHEN I'LL STOP LOVING YOU. The rest of the songs seem like experimentation but cool. They experiment and kinda succed here. Not bad at all. JUST GOT PAID is a good remake. A good party song.
1,PUPPETS OF THE MUSIC INDUSTRY.,I cant even put into words how much I despise these trendy commercial bands like nsync.They are a perfect example of the sorry state that music is in today.There are no good songs on the entire album and I wouldnt give this to my worst enemy.This is as commercial as commercial gets.Only naive little girls and people with poor taste in music would listen to this garbage.I pray to god that these cheesy pop bands and britney spears of the music industry will fade away soon.DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP!!!
2,Not So Good,"I honestly don't know why I have this c.d. It's not good at all. I think they could have done more on geting song titles that BSB don't. Then I think it would have made a difference. By the time BSB's new ablum comes out, it is going to be bye,bye,bye to Nsync's album. Although I think this c.d. is one of a kind."
3,Its always about them,"This is an ok album,by an average band. I still dont hear anything that proves to me that the the other members of N sync( lance,joey,and chris) actually are singing on the album. Bye Bye Bye, Its gonna be me,are probably the best songs on the album. Digital get down,is an ok song,about a retarded subject(cyber sex),and Space Cowboy is a little to much for the white boys to handle. Another thing thats not that great about this album is that almost everysong is about them,and a certain girl,or girls.(its gonna be ME, it makes ME ill, this I promise you, thats when I'LL stop loving you, I'LL be good for you,and I thaught she knew). But none the less this album comes through in the end,with some good dance songs that will make for a descent party album."
4,Better than I expected.....,"I have never been a big fan of ""boybands."" I heard this CD through a friend of mine who is really into *NSYNC. I had heard the self-titled debut awhile back and was not impressed, so going into this album, I was expecting the same letdown. However, I was pleasantly surprised. This album has more of an urban beat to it. It just makes you want to get up and dance, for the most part. The ballads show off the talents of the group. The voices of each memeber blend very well which is very evident in ""I Thought She Knew,"" the acapella track on the album. The cover of Johnny Kemp's ""Just Got Paid"" is very different, but it is a fun cover. You can tell that the members of the group had a good time recording the album, which always makes albums a little more fun. All in all, I liked this album more than I think I should. It is worth your time to give it a listen at least."
2,PLEASE TURN IT OFF,"ok, so it's nsync, but really i just don't see how they have sold so many copies of this. i do not hate nsync in fact, i pre-ordered NSA and couldn't wait for it to arrive. but the music just doesn't live up to all the hype. it is almost like they tried WAY too hard to out-do labelmates, the backstreet boys, whose latest cd millennium is a much better bet. truthfully, i wouldn't suggest wasting your money on this album, you'll get limited use out of it (until the next bsb cd). there are i guess 5 out of 12 songs that I can stand, but trust me, they are all very corny and come across as a bunch of 40 yr olds trying to get that one last hit, well technically, that is what it is. sorry guys!"
5,Best Band In The Whole Wide World!,I just wanted to say that *NSYNC is the hottest and most talented band in the whole wide world! All of the guys are great and their music is positive and fun. I went to their concert and I met them backstage and Justin asked me for my number. He wanted to 'hook-up' with little ol' me! He is the hottest one in that whole group. He has a great personality and a smile that melts my heart. *NSYNC should be everyone's fave band because THEY RULE! Ohh yeah..and this cd is the best..Be sure and pick up their new one it's out JULY 24TH 2001!! LateZ! *NSYNC FOREVER!!
1,Blaaaaaaaaghhhhhhh Trash Trash Trash!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This Cd is just another Jive from Jive records in attempt to stab the pockets of teenage girls This Cd shows again and again that in todays music industry will do anything to turn a quick buck . This shows no talent and a band who will not develop any further cuz they got no talent. If you could avoid this cd please do for your sake.
1,fruity pebbles,"um these guys are really rocking.right.311 arent that talented.red hot chili peppers rockthe best metal bands:incubus, deftones, korn oh yeah NSYNC HURRAY"
5,NSYNC IS #1,Hey all!! I just want to let you know that Nsync is seriously the #1 boyband and the best music group ever! They have the best music! i love them and i have forever!! They are great guys that love there music and fans and have a lot of heart! If you dont like them take time and listen to there music. It is aweseome!! They are hott guys (especially justin!!) and they have great voice!! They deserve all the credit in the world!!
3,N'Sync has talent,"I am a fan of good music, whatever kind it is. Although N'Sync might not write all of their lyrics, they do perform them well. Watching them sing live, and then listening to a song (like track 13 ""I thought she knew"") then anyone who knows music, realizes that these cats can harmonize extremely well. Knock them for being a ""boy band"" that was manufactured to put out pop music, if you want, but they have talent. I only gave this cd 4 stars because I only really liked half of the songs, I hope that they continue to put out good music. TCoe if you are looking for love, it's gonna be me!"
3,Thoughtcrime is alive and well.,"""It's gonna be me..."" The words resonate through my brain like a 44-caliber Magnum slug. Five overly scrubbed, polished to a perfect shine, teenage boys, manufactured to bring prepubescent girls to their knees in a mass of confusion, adoration and unrestrained giddiness. This is pop production at its best. Girls, follow the masses and purchase your NSYNC CD. Dissent will not be tolerated, comrade. You MUST purchase this CD or risk terrifying ostracism from your peers. You must conform. And you must mindlessly bounce along to the tuneful composition ""BYE BYE BYE"". Comrade Justin Timberlake has spoken to the proletariat.Customers who bought this title also purchased:Immodium AD"
1,Say Bye Bye Bye to your Money Money Money,"N'Sync's second album. Same songs on a different album and not surprisingly the voices all seem the same. These guys better make all the money they can before their looks go Bye Bye Bye and we start hearing ""paper or plastic?"" Why did I let my kids get it?"
2,Mature music fans be weary...,"When you compare this cd to its success the actual cd comes in at 2nd place. Hype has fueled this mega hit cd in many ways. This cd is definatley not for the mature music listener, but is quite sutitable for the youth. It, infact, is a perfectly produced piece for the young masses. Although, I think that anyone truly into music will find little in the cybersex driven lyrics, and the nice, but quite frankly weak ballads. Many teenyboppers would argue differently. Yes, it may be a hit on the charts, but to anyone mature music listener you will be safer in treading in the shallow waters of the other boy band's- the Backstreet Boys'- Millennium, which offers a more adult look a pop music...however weird it may sound..."
5,A sign of much better things to come!,"Some words of caution to others. Do not compare NSync to BSB. From the way things are going, and both of their last albums, NSync and BSB are taking different musical paths. While BSB have no doubt hit the jackpot with sublime pop and mushy ballads....NSync have opted for a slightly more adventurous route, and they have to be credited for being that little bit more daring. No Strings Attached is by no means a perfect album, but I have given it 5 stars for effort and bravery by the group to venture away from the teenybopper music that seems to be played to death these days by almost every boyband. At least these boys of NSync realise that they will one day not be teenyboppers anymore and are preparing for it. And.....hehehh...I have to mention this, JC is such an absolutely gorgeous guy. I really don't think that Justin is all that cute, but JC is one beautiful man!"
1,1 star for Bye Bye Bye,"I'm sorry to all those *NSYNC fans out there. But this CD wasn't what I expected it to be. After hearing ""Bye Bye Bye"" I was like ""I got to get their album"" and couldn't wait for it. When I bought and heard it. I was so dissappointed that I returned it back. I thought that these guys were going to be in a fast tempo based album. However they couldn't sing fast tempo songs. Stick to your ballads boys. Once again one star for ""Bye Bye Bye"". This CD is strongly recommended to NSYNC fans not for other people!"
4,NSYNC LOVER,"I just love Nsync's new album. My favorites are Bye Bye Bye,Gonna Be Me and Just Got Paid. I am only giving this a four because Space Cowboy has gotta be the worst song ever."
1,no strings attached? I've seen better,"no talent what so ever. There are no meaningful lyrics, no talent, and no work done. Despite the sales, it deserves no recognition."
1,What happened to real music?,"When I turn on the T.V. I usually manage to turn on a boy band. I have to think to myself, where has all the talent gone? Todays artists such as NSync are unable to comunicate skill to me and many others. Their lyrics (If you can call them their lyrics) show no meaning. They are shallow and completely superficial. I worry about today's youth listening to this music. It is not right for today's younger society to think that selling sex appeal is a good way to make money. So all of the critics out there you have a parental label on some CD's, you should put one the boy band alblums reading ""Parental Advisory: We are selling your child the idea that sex appeal is a good way to make money."" But instead, there are ""No Strings Attached."""
2,Expected more,"I am not really a fan of Nsync, but since this album got so much attention I decided to purchase it. In my opinion, the two songs they play on the radio are the best ones. Most of the other songs sound similar and just like one continuous song. Some of the songs are even quite cheesy at times and the singing is kind of annoying. Perhaps this album was rushed a bit to compete with other bands. They should have spent a little more time on it. I think I'll stick with BSB."
3,*N Sync,"While I've never been an *N Sync fan (actually, I've pretty much thought that they are talent-less, manufactured, bubble-gum pop pretty boys), I just bought their CD at the insistence of a friend (major fan), and suprise, I like it! Not because it shows *N Sync's vast talent (how could it, when they don't play instruments, and didn't even write their own music, and their voices are average at most), but because it's a fun, sweet album, that shows, not talent, but at least dedication! So, what I'm trying to say is that, while I don't like *N Sync, the album's okay..."
1,How did this become the fastest-seller in history?,"No, I have not brought this album and I never intend to. However, I have heard it in several music stores and I think it's very bad. I'm sick of the three songs that they've released.They aren't even very good singers. Justin sounds like a rat screeching and JC sounds like a very bad Elvis. I have never heard the other three sing, probably because they can't. The songs are very poorly written and arranged, each one sounds alike.I don't understand their appeal. Could there be 2.5 million teeny-boppers in love with them? I categorize them with Britney Spears as the least talented of the teen scene, but are the most successful because of their looks (what looks?)If you want some good pop music, listen to Backstreet Boys, Christina Aguilera or 98 Degrees. They at least sing."
5,No Strings Attached Rox's,Ok Well Um I don't know what's wrong with Mr. Wright. Cause No Strings Attached Will not be long forgotten. i belive it's the number one all time bestseller in the first week. This cd is soooo awesome. If i wasn't you would know no 2.8 million people would of bought it in the first week. Well second of all there not number 2 on there label there number one. I love the bsb but nsync's so much better. So if you don't have this cd go out and buy it. It's awesome. I lve it and so dose everyone else. Plus you gotta hear space cowboy that song's really kewl. You just don't have to take my word for it take the fact 2.8 million in the first week loved it. Plus there tour was sold out. Which was very good buy the way I went 2 nights ago. SO please buy this cd if you don't already have it
2,Not What it Should Be,"I was a little disappointed in this musical rendevous with NSYNC. It is good, but I think I was expecting a little more maturity on this one. It has good dance beats, but the album simply doesn't flow together. Love the Band, not the album"
1,"N*sync blows it, as usual","I really hated the new cd. well, i hate all their cd's any ways. the songs have no content and they are really pathetic. they could have done much better, compared to the bsb, who will always be #1. if i could have, i would have given ""no talent attached"" a -1000000000000 x infiniy! they seriously need 2 work on their songs and the melodies and they need to stop worring about their image (like they have one)."
1,The new C.D. no strings Attached Rulers,This is the the best C.D in the world because it is from N'SYNC the they ruler the world and I love Justin Timberlake and I till poeple my lest name is Timberlake because I love him so much I me so in love with him he is my baby and N'SYNC Rulers.
1,THE PREVIOUS FIVE STAR REVIEWER CAN BEND OVER AND TAKE IT LIKE A MAN,"PLEASE IGNORE THE PREVIOUS REVIEWER WHOSE ONLY WORK IN LIFE IS TO SLAM GREAT CLASSIC ROCK BANDS AND HE THEN CRIES WOLF WHEN OTHER PEOPLE SLAM THE TRASH (JUSTIN,BRITNEY,ASHLEE,JENNIFER LOPEZ,BACKSTREET BOYS)THAT HE LISTENS TO.N STYNC ARE HISTORY AND THEIR ALBUMS HAVE BOMBED THE WORLD OVER.THE BOY BAND ERA IS OVER SO DONT BE SEEN WITH THIS AWFUL CD.REVIEW OVER.OVER AND OUT"
1,...,I will amitt that I did think that the first NSYNC CD was good so I naturally thought that this CD would be even better. Boy was I suprised. The songs have nothing to do with relality and do not relate to the average persons life. I would not recommend this CD to anyone.
1,How in their right minds would listen to these nut cases????,Ok some of their songs are ok. Yeah right! I think that they are to fill of them selves. Like when jc braids his hair it looks like he got scared. If it was up to me[which it isn't] I would have any of their CD's for sale.
1,YUCK,"i think it would be awsome if they didn""t put didutal get down or whatever it's sooooooo sick my freinds cousin hears this stuff and she's 8. i mean come on people ''baby baby we can do all that we want we can get nasty nasty'' yuck.DON'T BUY THIS CD."
1,Burn the C.D!,"This is one horrible c.d. that it probably fun if you sprayed acid in your face. Anyways, notice that you need a string to attach to heads so you could move it. *nsync is totally no creativity and brains attached."
3,Untied,"Like their first album, I like a few of the songs. Considering all the hype surrounding this album, I was disappointed when I listened to it in its entirety. My favorite song is ""Bye, Bye, Bye."" It's nice that the boys wrote some of the songs (well, at least J.C.). With an album like this, it's no wonder the Backstreet Boys are more popular. If you like NSYNC, you will like this."
5,THIS ALBUM IS HOT!,"NSYNC HAS DONE IT AGAIN. THIS ALBUM IS GREAT ALL THE SONGS ARE AWESOME ESPECIALLY THE HIT SINGLE ""BYE BYE BYE"". THESE GUYS ARE SO TALENTED AND SO CUUUUUUUTEEEEEE! IF YOU HAVEN'T BOUGHT THEIR CD ""NO STRINGS ATTACHED"" I ADVICE YOU TO GO AND GET IT. I ASSURE YOU THAT YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. JUSTIN, CHRIS, LANCE, JOEY, AND JC YOU GUYS ARE GREAT!"
3,N my Opinion,"The greatly anticipated *NSYNC album hit the stores on Tuesday Mar 21st. Like many other devoted fans I barrelled through the doors of my favorite CD store the minute it opened. I rushed back to my car and popped it in. To my dismay I was not to thrilled by ""No Strings Attached"" by no means was this a bad album but for the length of time I waited for the release I would have expected more. I liked of course Bye Bye Bye and my second favorite was This I promise you. BUT after that is kinda falls flat. Everything else seemed slightly adolescent and simple. I know that the age range of NSYNC fans are between the ages of 5 and 16 but there also some mature older individuals like myself who were expecting a more mature sound. BSB album was by far a secondary smash. Nothing like there first. ""No Strings Attached"" was just like NSYNC only with a few catchy beats. There is no doubt in my mind that this album won't do well but I don't think NSYNC hit a homerun with this one."
1,A discrase to music,"First I would like to say that five guys that don't play instruments, dance around the stage, and don't sing good lyics (in my opinion they didn't sing anything at all) is not a band. Thety are barly a music group. Them, like many other groups of the late 90's (the begining of the dark age of music that we are in now as i like to call it) only got popular becasue MTV said you should listen to it. WELL DONT. The music sucks and every time I here Bye Bye Bye I play someone ramdonly come up to me with a gun and pull the trigger. Im glad they broke up (not supprises there.) If you want good music then travel back a bit to the 60's and 70's and listne to the exellence of the music then. The Who, The Beatles, and Led Zeppelin are good places to start."
1,Bye Bye Bye N'Sync!,"After hearing Bye Bye Bye I was quite looking forward to buying No Strings Attached, thinking that such an impressive first single would indicate an impressive sophomore album. Just goes to show you you really CAN'T judge a book by its cover. N'Sync takes the term ""sophomore slump"" to entirely new levels. Overproduced, overprocessed, and utterly unlistenable. They might've broken BSB's record for first week album sales, but I know what true talent is. And it comes in the form of five men named AJ, Nick, Howie, Kevin and Brian. Enjoy your 15 minutes of fame JC, Justin, Joey, Chris and Lance. Your days are numbered."
1,a new low for commercial music,Calling this a bad cd would be an insult to bad cds everywhere. The complete lack of quality and original ideas is impressive. I did not think that it was possible to produce an entire cd as a showcase to lack of musical talent. The worst part is this cd will sell millions and will be the anthem of brainless morons who have given into mindless corporate music.
4,No Oops... They did it again,"They did it again, produced another quality album. The two singles released so far are the best on the CD, but many others are worth listening to. I wasn't sure how this follow-up album would be, but no-one should be disapointed."
3,Not Bad,"im a fellow who listens to pop music (rap is the best) but i went and bought this album on a saturaday when it didnt hit the stores. when i was in the store i took a look at the back to see the song lists. i was disapointed becuz there was no , Somewhere Someday and Only in Heaven's eye. i know the two was on the sdtks but it wouldnt hurt to have it on the album. it took me a month to grow into this album. 98 better than nsync n bsb late"
4,PRETTY DAMN GOOD,'No Strings Attached' is a pretty cool CD. It's got quite a few slow songs on it but other than that it's pretty whack! THe best song has gotta be BYE BYE BYE of course!
2,Slightly Disapointed,"Sorry guys, but I feel that this CD didn't live up to NSyncs potential. While most of the songs were absolutely great, I was not impressed in the least with Digital Get Down. The content of this song was very, VERY inappropriate for many of their young fans. I also had a problem with all the digital enhancements and background vocals that were obviously not performed by the guys. You have such great voices, let us here them like you did on the first album. I'm still a huge fan, but I still listen to the good old first album and am hoping that that their next release will be more like the first. If any of you guys from NSync read this, please take to heart what I said, and consider it for the next album. Let us hear your beautiful voices, which is why many people buy your CD's, and keep it clean. I know many parents who took your new CD away from their kids because of Digital Get Down. Stay 'n sync"
4,edgy pop,"I really recommend this CD for ANY fans of NSync, Backstreet Boys, LFO, etc...and even those who don't traditionally like boy bands. There's no denying it - it's STILL bubble gum pop...(quote) ""when winter comes in summer, when there's no more forever...that's when I'll stop loving you"". However, most songs are upbeat and edgy and do NOT have NSync's name in there....hence ""yes, yes, here we go, NSync has got the flow"" from their debut album. They're even going a little bit risque - 'Digital Get Down' is all about cyber sex and I must admit, there's just something about Justin talking about ""getting nasty"" and JC telling us about gettin ""to freakin"". It'll sure have all the little girls in fits. Overall...it's a pretty good CD - pretty funny too. :)"
5,ROCKIN BABY!,"Wow. That's one word to discribe this album. It's incredible! The songs are great, catchy and fun to listen to. The lyrics stay with you all day until your friends finally tell you to shut up. I don't usually like boy bands, but BB haters WILL like this cd. And if you don't, there's one good thing out of this. Backstreet Boys are in complete retreat after seeing N'Sync!"
1,"Horrible CD, do not buy, do not recommend","I have been to many *N Sync concerts and know their potential talent. Their debut album was great, but this album definitely shows the limits of the 5 guys. I strongly recommend that you look elsewhere for a good CD. Their lack of true spirit in their voices definitely shows on this album."
1,The Worst thing I have ever heard,"These five babies are a disgrace to the music industry. While some of the beats ""sound good"" the lyrics are horrible, no depth and no real feeling in them. Some of the lyrics were just put together to be like a rap/hip hop song when these guys are obviously the farthest thing from a hip hop group. They have a song on cyber sex for God's sakes"
5,The Best of 2000,"All I have to say is this is the best CD out right now. I am not you typical fan being that I am 20 years old. 'N Sync hs out done themselves. If you want a great CD, this IS IT. If you don't believe me, just check out the other reviews. Out of 528 reviews, there are only a handful that are negative. That many people can't be wrong. Granted, I would have loved more ballads on this album, but I really love the up-tempo songs. This is a must-have for anyone."
3,Reattach The Strings,"Just like everyone else, I've had March 21st, 2000 circled on my calender for months. Of course, it was the day that the much anticipated second 'N Sync album came out. What a major let down when I put the CD in my car. The first two tracks ""Bye, Bye, Bye"" and ""It's gonna be me"" are pretty catchy, but it is all down hill from there. Granted that I've only listened to the entire CD twice, but their sound is something that has been down before and is a major disappointment in comparison to their first album. For those 'N Sync fans who are upset about the new one, I'm sure that they will easily forgive the boys for their blunder. Lou is it to late for you to come back to help the boys out?"
2,It wasn't that great.,"My sister just recently got this cd and kept me awake last night even thought it was played in the other room. Now, I don't know about you, but i don't like being kept awake at 1 AM by 5 handsome males crooning about their new and lost loves. As jealous as i am for their looks, fame, and fortune, i guess it's better than being kept awake by my sister's previous obsession, hanson. So thank God for N'Sync."
4,It was great...but you gotta love Nsync,When I first heard the CD I was kinda scared. The music was so much different from the first CD. But I listened to every song and there really catchy. I love how there trying to show people that they can sing other kinds of music...which was great for me because I love all kinds of music. I also thought that it was really easy to relate to the songs. I love it alot
2,Speaking of Sellouts...,"This isn't another one of those reviews that are aimed at only badmouthing a boy band, so please don't immediately label me as such, k?Now that I've got that out of the way, onto the review. I think that 'N Sync's new album is not all that it is cracked up to be. It may be the best selling cd of all time, but it does not deserve it. The beats are all the same, and the songs are limp crap, although somewhat catchy. Songs like BYE BYE BYE redeem this cd, but only barely. Songs like YIPPE YAY or whatever it is make it worth putting back on the shelf and never disturbing it again.I give them kudos for trying to venture out into new realms of music, but I give them an F for results. 'N Sync should stick to what they know best: jumping around in music videos for songs that are completely manufactured."
1,Who do they think they are?,"Oh. my. freakin. gosh. Who the heck does N SYNC think theyare? Holy cow, they should know by now that their main listening group is girls UNDER the age of 18! Do they *really* need to hear songs about cybersex? Get real! Who wants their kids listening to songs like that? All the hype was for no good, because this song (""Digital Get Down"") brings the WHOLE album down. I have hardly any respect for the boy bands, but compared to this album, BSB and 98 Deg. are angels. Spend your money on better things and keep your standards higher than a bunch of guys trying to make money off of hormone-driven teens!"
1,Ugh!!!!!,"Please don't buy this. It will just encourage record companies to start more of these awful boy bands. If you like this sort of thing, you seriously need to acquire some better taste in music."
3,Disappointing....,"The media made this CD out to be the best music ever, don't listen to them.... its cheesy. The fact is that N'sync used less originalty then ever! Every song sounds the same....and when they say you wont have to skip a song on this cd, ITS A PURE LIE! , I skip almost all of them and thats when i listen to it, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1,N'Sync is quite possibly the worst thing to ever hit music,"Yeah, that's right. Horrible, mind-numbingly horrible. If they learned how to play instruments or something, then they might have a fighting chance as a descent band. Do not buy this CD. It will only encourage them.[tom]"
1,What a waste of money,"After all the hype about this cd I really expected something good, what a let down. I wish I could get my money back. The lyrics in some of the songs are terrible. They are not for little kids to hear. These guys should be ashamed of themselves. Their first cd was pretty good but on the second they went down the tubes. If they continue to sing like this they will be gone in a year or two. They need to stick with what they sang on the first cd. I have noticed that the professionals in the music bussiness have given this cd a very poor rating which it deserves. The only good ratings are from the teenagers and a couple of adults but they are basing their opinions on the fact that five cute guys with some fast music are singing not on the depth of the music and the words. If they don't change we will be saying bye bye bye to NSYNC because this type of music from them will get old fast."
1,whatever,"After my lil' insane kid sister brought this stupid album and blasting it. All I'm gonna say is, it's poison. N'sync's music is plain meaningless like the rest of the teen markets. Except unlike backstreet boys or christina aguilera, THEY CAN'T SING. And this album proves that. It's also ironic and funny to see them straining really hard to copy and beat bsb too. If you want quality music, get goo goo dolls or alanis morrisette. Coz CAN YOU SERIOUSLY TELL ME YOU CAN GET ANYTHING OUT OF the repeative words of 'BYE BYE BYE'?"
1,"Enjoy the ride to the city of ""Where are they now""","Pure garbage. Are there any real instruments on this album. Save your money. This is real trash. Looking forward to when these clowns really go Bye-Bye-Bye, which won't be long once the boy-band craze dies! It will not take long until this is in the discount rack and people wonder...HMMM...What do think 'NSYNC is doing now?"
2,NOT GOOD AT ALL,"ok, this album is just awful. The bland ballads (this i promise you is an exception) are terrible. The vocals are all weak and whiny, and nothing special. I don't know why i even wasted my time listening to this garbage! They will alway be SECOND to bsb. nsync just don't have staying power."
3,Not exactly a review......,"...but I'm a bit confused as to how good N'Sync's latest album will be because I love the song Bye, bye, bye but i'm not 100% satisfied with It's gonna be me or I'll never stop- the first one sounds like it's for kids. So basically this 'review' is a request to all N'sync fans to write a review of what each song is EXACTLY like (i.e R n'B/ pop/ hip-hop.....)thanx, it'll be a big help to me!"
5,I dont like jessica simmpson,I wish that NSYNC WOULDO make out with christina aguilera because they smell like caca and they would have 100 babies.
4,michelle durham,I think it pretty good .I THINK they should not compete with the bsb.I do have cd of bsb. I did listen to some of the song of 'n Sync new music from the internet. I think it good from all the song.I wish there best of luck. so the bsb.
3,"""Digital Get Down"" reminiscient of ""Empty"" by JANET","""Digital Get Down"" takes its cue from the jam from the ""Velvet Rope"" from Ms. Janet entitled ""Empty""; it is very satisfying and progressive with the same basic elements of progressive drum and bass/tribal aspects that were prevalent in Janet's ""Empty"", which took its cue from Madonna's ""Words"" from ""Erotica"" . Janet's ponders the relevance of the relationshop based on on-line liasons, while 'N Sync's glorifies the experience of adolescent urges in all its suggestive expression. This may be objectionable to some, but it just an extension of the ear candy-that some consider commercial pap- that 'N Sync offers on the album. P.S. Thanks to Rickey Wright for modifying her Amazon.com review to reflect the fact that it was Johnny Kemp-not Johnny Gill as originally stated- who did ""Just Got Paid"" originally."
5,Why this cd is the best!,"I bought this cd the day it came out, and i have enjoyed ever since. People think that *Nsync is a typical boy band but they aren't. They wirte and perform lyrics that move people. Their lyrics create a since of calm in your mind. All of their tunes are upbeat and funky. You don't have to skip any songs on this cd, it's the best. On a scale of 1-10 I give it an 11!"
2,"A good effort, but not my thing","I've hated poppy music since I was like 8 and my older cousin (a girl) listened to New Kids on the Block; BUT I figured since so many people like it that I'd give it a try. ""Bye Bye"" sets the mood for the rest of the album, but there is some variety, like true love songs and light rap. I give them credit, for what they do, they do better than I could if my life depended on it. As a fan of heavy rock & metal, (Metallica, Pantera, Skid Row, etc) you've gotta admit it was really brave to even try this, my friends would kill me if they knew! The dudes should however try to do something a little harder just so more people can get into them. It wasn't as bad as I thought, but it ain't for me."
5,must have,This cd is an excellent way to get going in the morning. My kids and I listen to it almost every morning on the way to school. These guys are awesome! A must have in anyone's cd collection. ps i just adore justin and joey
2,The New N'Sync Album,"My 12 year old daughter recently received the new N'Sync album, ""No Strings Attached"", and she loves it. She even posted a message in the Kids Reviews page, saying it was ""da bomb"". I'm not so sure I can say the same, however. The music sounds like it is more geared towards pre-teens and teenagers. The majority of the music sounds like hip-hop. I am actually more into the ballads and mature music of the other CD. But if you are an N'Sync fan like my daughter and some of her friends, this CD is worth the money."
4,N'Sync Rocks!,"I recently received the new N'Sync album as a birthday present. I think it's da bomb! My favorite is ""Bye Bye Bye"", and the other songs are good too. I have the other N'Sync album also, and it sounds too much like the Backstreet Boys. I would HIGHLY recommend buying this CD if you like good pop music."
5,Whatever,I think this album is there best yet!It really has more of a beat to it.Who ever thinks this album is sad needs to get over BSB!I'd rather listen to 'Nsync anyday!
1,The apocolypse is upon us,"My little sister insists on putting this in the car whenever I drive her around, and to be frank, it is the most worthless arrangement of sound in the history of modern music. Don't get me wrong. I get the whole boy-band craze. But 'N Sync are so bad, it's comical. One minute, they're heartfelt lovers crooning ""baaaayybee"" and the next minute they think they are RUN DMC.Besides the lame lyrics, and the ""over"" singing, this album suffers from way too much on the production end. It's almost as if the managers of NSync knew that the album was lousy, so they tried to add as many background tracks as they could just to make it interesting. It didn't work The result, is a pre-fabricated collection of boyband-itis at its worst.I never thought I would ever say this...but this is one CD that would actually make me reach for the BackStreet Boys."
1,This Too Shall Pass,"The Four Seasons, the Beatles, the Monkees, the Jackson 5, the Osmond Brothers, Culture Club, we've seen it all before. These bands are like buses, if you miss one, just wait while and another will come along soon.Thanks to 12 year old girls, these guys will make a few dollars, but the problem is that 12 year old girls grow up and move on. N'Sync won't stand the test of time."
1,When did The Spirit J*ck*ffs ever make a record?,"Triple H: N'SYNC should be called XTINKT! Shawn Michaels: You got that right Triple H! Triple H: Is it me or does Justin look like Kenny of The Spirit Squad. Shawn Michaels: Yes and he sounds like him, a wuss who would get beaten up by D-GENERATION X! Triple H: Also, Bye Bye Bye and It's Gonna Be Me are as bad as eating a rotted tuna fish sandwich. Shawn Michaels: Also, Steve Miller should sue these losers and Left Eye's estate for stealing Space Cowboy from him! Triple H: What next, Bratney Sneers calling herself The Gangsteress of Love. Shawn Michaels: We don't have to worry about XTYNCT anymore as they are disbanded, especially after Lance admitted to loving things who had last names like Clark, Cheney, Embersol and Parry. If you are not down with D-X, WE GOT TWO WORDS FOR YA(crowd yells ""S*CK IT!"")!"
4,Rickey Wright needs his head examined,"I would just like to say for the record, Rickey Wright needs his head examined. N'Sync's lastest album, No Strings Attached, is by far much better then the BSB's work. N'Sync has much stronger harmonies, including a great bass in Lance Bass. Their acapella work is totally amazing. It is a really great CD and I totally enjoy it!"
3,OK,"I really like some of the songs on this CD, like Bye Bye Bye, It's Gonna be Me, and This I Promise You. But, most of the rest of the songs aren't that great, which I think ruins the reputataion of an album. This is a funky, upbeat CD that I would reccommend to anyone who likes to dance and stuff like that."
5,DA BOMB!,"I purchased this CD thinking that i would only like the hit song ""bye bye bye"" but when i listened to the CD it was great! GREAT VALUE!"
5,NSYNC ROCK,"THIS ALBLUM REALLY ROCKS AND I DONT SEE HOW PEOPLE CAN DIS IT, IT IS BETTER THAN THEIR FIRST ALBUM. THE SONGS I REALLY LIKE R IT'S GONNA BE ME, IT MAKES ME ILL, THIS I PROMISE U, IF IM NOT THE ONE R REALLY GREAT SONGS. IF YOUR MADE ABOUT NSYNC AS I AM THEN ITS A MUST HAVE. THEY SOUND EVEN BETTER IN THIS ALBUM THAN THEY DO IN THEIR FIRST, ESPECIALLY JUSTIN."
5,Awesome CD!,"This CD is the best CD that I own. I don't know where the editorial review about it being bad came from. But obviously from all other reviews on Amazon.com, No Strings Attached isn't a bad CD. And by the album record sales show that obviously they are better than the Backstreet Boys. This is another great work by *N Sync and would recommend it to every and anyone."
5,Awesome!,NSYNC is definatly one of the best bands out there. There new CD no Strings Attached really shows how independent they are and how they can rule the charts. My opinion is that this CD is better than Millenium. I hate to compare them to the backstreet boys because that is what ewveryone does but i've bought both and i just like one more than the other. My favorite track on the CD is Thats when i'll stop loving you. it's so sweet and there voices are beautiful. My next favorite is it's gonna be me because of the way Justin's voice sounds. This really is a great buy and totally worth the money. NSYNC is awesome and so much more.
4,this is ok,"dude, this is defenatly not as good as the other album, but its still good, ""this I promise you"" is a great slow song! the best! bye bye bye was really good, but people r way overdoing it! they play it over n over n over! digital get down in my mind is disgusting and youde probably agree unless your one of those cyber stalkers lookin 4 sex or u just love anything and everything that n sync does. bringin da noise is a really good party song. its gonna be be is good, but begining to be overplayed like bye bye bye. the last song i dont like much cuz well, just doesnt sound 2 good! well, u see 4 urself!"
1,Blah.,"I don't care what's on the album, Nsync is probably the worst band ever. I'd like to talk to the incomptent imbecile who writes songs for them. They sound like girls. Maybe they are girls.If you want some good music, try Bob Dylan or Steely Dan or the Beatles (yes I really am a kid). Even Nirvana's better than Nsync."
1,N'SYNC or N'SANE,"I do not believe the other views. I find this music utterly depressing or extremely laughable. It depends on what view I choose to look at this pile of dung masquerading as a marketable cd of ""music."" Readers, beware, one listen and you might not be able to recognize ""music"" again once you listen to it. It's the MEDUSA of our era."
2,Not a fan but the album was OK I guess,"I have to admit, I am NOT a *NSYNC fan. I am a Backstreet Boys fan, but the new album from *NSYNC was OK. I thought some of the songs were pretty catchy, but I thought that the guys tried a little bit too hard to try and beat the ""other"" boy bands. To tell you the truth, I would rather grab a BSB album and listen to that, but the *NSYNC album is OK too."
2,hm....it's not bad..but not great,I think like everyone else I expected this cd to be great because of all the hype. I bought it and was surprised how much it didn't sound like nsync. I was a little disapointed. But I have been listening to it and it kinda grows on you. I think they should go back to the old stuff they used to do ...not all the hip hop stuff. It's not them. I hope they go back to their old music...or they might lose some fans.
3,Too much hype,"Yes, I am a teenager and do like Nsync. But this cd wasen't all it made out to be. I can't stand Space Cowboy. The only songs that are good is This I promise you, the 2 other ballads, BYE BYE BYE. With BSB, everyone said they needed more upbeat.. but Nsync needed more ballads. Their first cd flowed quite better. I will say this cd is oh k, but with all the legal suits and the switch over. Was it really worth it? I am glad to see that they are slowly, starting to write songs(JC and Justin). But on there next one(which i hope there will be one). They need to think about all aspects instead of just throwing songs together. I am not dissing Nsync, or anything I am a fan. Just dissapointed with the No strings attached cd."
3,So-So,"this cd is not that great. if you liked bye bye bye, just buy the single. there are a few good songs like just got paid which is the song from the 80s, it's gonna be me, bye bye bye, and maybe a couple more. i really don't recomend it unless your that teeny bopper, nsync obsessed kind of girl. then you won't be able to help yourself. the slow songs are really good but i don't really like slow songs unless im dancing with someone 'cause they're boring.you should just ask your friend with the cd to make a tape of all the good songs for you (pick the ones you like)."
3,An ok CD,"This is an ok cd. The lyrics are ok, but not exactly for the young listener. Parents, if you are buying this for your young child, watch out for ""Digital Getdown"", which could be interperted as hailing the joys of cybersex. But everything else was great. I myself loved the songs ""No Strings Attached"" and ""It's Gonna be Me"""
5,This CD is definitely better than their first one,"NO STRINGS ATTACHED is really good! I gotta admit Bye,BYe,Bye is way overplayed and has lost alot of its appeal, but all the other ones are great. The only one i don't really like is the 11th one, but the rest are great and if u didn't like it the first time u heard it, there's something wrong and u should listen to it again."
5,A Great CD- well worth the wait,"This is a really blazzin' cd and it was worth the wait fir this cd to come out. It is a good cd and none of the songs are bad enough to skip. It at least deserves to be listened to, if not bought. IT is a well written cd and the songs are fantastic because the guys harmonize really well!"
2,Nice Try,"Whenever you fans hear these Boy band albums with all this pop-techno driven divel do you ever think, Hey!, this one sounds familiar, it sounds like a BB song. Those unoriginal bastards! Why, I otta... oh yeah I forgot, I'll like something else in a month.Oh by the way, why 2 stars? Cuz Bye Bye Bye was mildly amusing the first million times it was played."
5,The best of the best of the best!,"This CD rocks! BYE BYE BYE, IT'S GONNA BE ME,SPACE COWBOY,JUST GOT PAID,IT MAKES ME ILL,THIS I PROMISE YOU,NO STRINGS ATTACHED,DIGITAL GET DOWN,BRINGIN' 'DA NOISE,THAT'S WHEN I'LL STOP LOVIN' YOU, I'LL BE GOOD FOR YOU AND I THOUGHT SHE KNEW, are the best songs I have ever heard in my entire lfe"
1,This is bad.... pop should be illegal.,"This music is meaningless! It is bad for the country to have to hear this horrible music. Some people have talents and get nowhere. This group of non talented boys has made millions for not doing anything. Sure its easy to lib-sync and get your voiced changed by a computer to sound better. I could be a pop star and I would not even have to try! It is a shame that a group of guys could get so popular when there are millions of more talented people who have not recieved as much fame as them. Do you know who deserves fame? Our Lady Peace. They are a very talented band who plays their own instuments and makes fantastic music. There is not one song on any of their CDs that I do not like. Be sure to check out their four CDs naveed, clumsy,Happiness is not a fish that you can catch, and spiritual machines."
1,WORST MUSIC IN HISTORY,I cant believe that young people would waste their pocket money on such painful garbage. These boy bands have NO TALENT at all.I feel very embarrased for teenagers who think this is good music.Why isnt there any talent out there today ?Maybe they all killed themselves after hearing this sort of crap.....
4,N'Sync pumps up the beats and style on No Strings Attached,"I have to say I'm not a HUGE fan of the POP market out there but I really like N'Sync's single ""Bye, Bye, Bye"" so I thought I'd check the record out. And after listening to it I have to give them props because I think the tracks are up beat in tempo and have some cool beats. Along with ""Bye, Bye, Bye,"" other tracks worth noting are ""Digital Getdown"", ""It's Gonna Be Me"", and ""No Strings Attached"". So I'll admit it I'm a guy and I like N'Sync! So shoot me."
1,A lack of emotion and effort reflected in this CD,"I am a big fan of N Sync. I was stunned at their capability in their debut album. Their voices in their debut album was amazing, though this album is certainly an exception.Though I looked forward to buying this album, I was definitely dissappointed. Their lack of true feeling is strongly reflected on this album. Their lack of creativity is also shown. It seems like they just want people to hope that they are good, not actually knowing that. I strongly do not recommend this poorly-efforted and produced album."
3,Not bad....,"While the ballads seem strained, unimaginative, and sappy, the faster dance tracks really save this album. It makes sense why Bye, Bye, Bye was released first since it blows the whole rest of the album out of the water. Overall a good effort but keep the remote handy to skip the teeny-bop ballads."
5,Honestly...,"okay, honestly, i don't know why people are saying all this stuff about *nsync. to me, their old cd was good, and this one's even better, but don't take my word on it. just buy the cd and if you like it, then you spent your money well. if not, take it to a pawn shop or sell it. who cares what other people say about it? chances are, not all of them are gonna have the same opinion about them as you. just get it and see for yourself. it's not the end of the world."
2,Sort Of Farty,"This album (even though I admit these male forms of idiocy have a minuscule amount of talent)was a lame excuse for any form of quality music. This is simple bubblegum pop music and all these manufactured bands(includin' Nsync) will blow away in a year or two. These fans claim these dudes are timeless and extraordinarily talented. Honestly. What a load of wasted plastic, paper, and fifteen dollars and ninety-five cents."
1,Blah! What is this?!,"If their is one CD I don't like in this world, this is it! The lyrics are poor and the songs are just plain annoying!! They can't sing at all and it's all I hear on the radio! Avoid it!"
5,WONDERFUL !,"I thought tis CD was the best I've heard in years. I put it in my CD player and I listen to the whole cd rather than switch through the songs I don't like. This is different, I LOVE the whole thing. Buy this !"
3,Just Below the Mark,"N Sync new cd was a little disapointing. I'm not realy crazy about them but I bought their cd, and to tell the truth I expected a little more. Sometimes I didn't like the sounds of the voices and most of the songs were the same. Some were good and had a great beat, but they have to improve a whole lot to beat out the Backstreet Boys. I'm sure we will forget about this cd when their next one comes out"
1,utter dreck,"I'd like to hit one of these guys in the face with a red-hot frying pan. Unbelievably bad. Spengler was right, we're doomed."
2,Grouchy parent,"We have loved previous song hits, and I learned ALL the words along with my 8 and 6 year old girls. But this CD left us flat. The first 5 or 6 songs were loudly orchestrated, rap-strong, lousy tune and words. I rushed to buy it for my girls, but they shut it off before it was done. Next time, I'll listen first before jumping at N'Sync."
3,"Don't get me wrong, I love *N Sync...","...but this pales in comparison to their debut. If they had put Trashin' The Camp on here, it would be more worth it. I can't complain, a stupid friend of mine kept changing whether she likes BSB or *N Sync and gave me this and their debut for free. But... there's just not enough worthwhile songs. ""Bye Bye Bye"", ""It's Gonna Be Me"", and ""Space Cowboy"" (ok, ok, and ""Digital Getdown"") are the only really good songs. If ya like *N Sync, I guess... But I hope Celebrity is better."
4,Good outnumber the bad for No Strings Attached,"The first track of No Strings Attached speaks for itself. ""Bye Bye Bye"" to the whole notion that 'N Sync is a regular, here today, gone next week boyband. The rest of the CD is just as strong, with little slips on the over-produced ""I'll Be Good For You"" and ""That's When I'll Stop Loving You"". They are ballads though, and even though they may not be the best type of music, they are what the fans want. The good outnumber the bad though, as seen by this list of 'good' tracks: ""It's Gonna Be Me"", ""Just Got Paid"", ""It Makes Me Ill"", ""No Strings Attached"" and ""I Thought She Knew"". Not bad from a fan who usually listens to rock, and can't stand pop radio."
4,Pretty Good!,"I loved Bye Bye Bye, It's Gonna Be Me, This I Promise You, and No Strings Attached, but the rest was just so-so."
3,infectious although manufactured pop,"i'm not ashamed to say that i'm a fan of nsync. after borrowing this cd from a friend, i just had to own it myself. i'll admit, it does suffer from drawbacks of popular music, such as overproduction and fluff (i.e. ""space cowboy,"" ""bring in da noise,"" ""just got paid,"" and ""digital get down""), but it also possesses some of the trademarks of popular music.a couple songs are simply infectious. proof is the overwhelming success of ""bye bye bye"" and ""it's gonna be me."" ""it makes me ill"" can also be included with this group once it's released. it also has some fine, albeit obviously over-sappy ballads, i.e. ""this i promise you"" and ""i thought she knew,"" a personal favorite of mine.overall, although i cannot listen to the entire cd without fast-forwarding through a bunch of songs, i did enjoy the ones that i like. plus, nsync is easily my favorite boy band, and as i said before, i am not ashamed to admit it."
1,What a horrible compact disc!,"To say this cd contains music, would be a lie. You cannot say that Nsync is a musical group. Do they play any instruments? I didn't think so, and as far as I'm concerned the term music means to play instruments and create a sound without help from any computers. Pop music will fall, and real music shall rise!"
4,Very good. Definitely worth getting.,"Very good. Had 2 songs that to me were a little bit too sappy. The others were excellent. A great time to listen to this CD is when there's nothing else to do. I've listened to the CD quite a few times with nothing else to do and gave me something to listen do. Even though 2 of the songs are a little too sappy, it's still definitely worth buying."
4,another cd out there,"well, i really don't listen to this boy band pop pallozza trash out there so let me get to the point, take it from me, a non-nsync fan, this CD is great, it's different, and actually has songs with a meaning."
1,"Yes Yes here we go, N sync has got to go!","In this album expect to find black wannabes that can't rap, find remixes of old songs that they can't sing well in, and finally don't watse 13 bucks or more buying this garbage."
5,Space Cowboy,i loved the cd because it is upbeat and has some great tracks on it and it blows millenium out of the water with its strange yet intriuging tunes! i can't wait for the next one that they produce because i will buy it without ever looking back which is what eveyone should do with this cd!
1,Think Twice,"Before you go out and buy this album, you should consider what it consists of. It also depends on what type of person you are. There are the screaming fans who buy their music through anything, and would do so if they began singing country or rap, just because its 'N Sync. And there are the people that just liked all or some of their music for its style. If you are one of those, you should know what you're getting into, since they're songs are not pure pop anymore. They have become more R&B with some rap, and if you're not a fan of this music, you shouldn't get this album, since this is what you'll get. So before you go out with a smile on your face to buy this album, make sure you're not about to become disappointed."
1,It made me ill,"Ugh.I wonder how many N Sync fans are secretly disapointed after listening this album. It's basically just 5 wannabes trying too hard to make a good album. Sorry, N Sync, but you failed. ""Digital Get Down"", ""Just Got Paid"" and ""It makes me ill"" are just a few of the mindless songs on this album. Do yourself a favour and don't buy this."
3,"""digital getdown"" isn't dirty at all compared to BSB's songs","For those of you complaining about ""digital getdown"" and claiming that the backstreet boys are ""cleaner,"" well I'd have to disagree. Ever hear that one BSB song where Nick asks, ""Am I sexual?"" and the rest of the group eagerly responds, ""Yeaaahhhh."" And what about Brian wanting to thank their fans ""in a different way"" in their song ""Larger Than Life""? My point is that everyone has a different way of interpretting the lyrics of songs. Don't be so one-track minded. NSync said that ""Digital Getdown"" is about dancing in a virtual reality night club linked over the internet. (As for BSB's wanting to thank their fans ""in a different way,"" I'm sure they meant that they wanted to do more than they can for their fans. But the other example...I don't think there's any explanation for)."
1,No Talent Here,"Look, i dont know why people compare the boy bands, they do nothing, they dont play any instruments(mabey the piano, but who can't)they have NOTHING to do with the production ( those fake Beats) and they dont even write there own lyrics(that is sad). I could take 5 guys out of a highschool chior, dress them up, through some lame lyrics at them, and they would have as much or more talent then Nsync. Since they don't write there own lyrics, it doesnt take a scientist to figure out everything they sing has no real meening to them. Sure mabey on this albume they wrote like 1 song(WOW) but that isnt nothing to get choked up about, face it, grow up.......there FAKE"
3,"its.... ok, but not all that.","I bought this disc as a holiday present and I tottaly regret it. I enjoy the first two songs and the rest is ...well, garbage. the songs dont have an even beat and they just plain dont sound good. who hasn't heard BYE BYE BYE and ITS GONNA BE ME?! those ARE good songs but the rest dont come even close to those hits. maybe NSYNC should think of playing better , more meaningful songs. I dont want to get all mushy- but something that the listeners will understand and ENJOY!!:]= smiley"
1,"hurry up *nsync, you still got 10,000 more miles.","Enough with this, this c.d. is totally makes me ill and it is a digital letdown. People are just making good reviews so they can help *nsync out. Look at the critics, most of them gave it bad reviews and I for once agree with them. If it is still a boy band fight it is gonna be them who is breaking up first."
5,Aweasom,I absolutely love album because the bonus tracks are just so aweasom.If Only In Heavens Eyes is so beautiful.This album bring music back into me.
2,Loss of Effort,"N'Sync's new album lacks harmony. The freshman effort was 100 times greater than the effort they put into this album. I guess once you've made millions, the quality of your work deminishes. They will continue making a fortune due to the simple fact they are five good looking guys that girls admire, talented or not."
1,I'm not impressed...,"When my sister gave me this CD as a gift, I expected it to be bad. However, being the open-minded person that I am, I decided to give it a listen before completely disregarding it. After listening to the entire album twice, I must say I was surprized. Nsync really exceeded my expectations; No Strings Attached was not merely bad, but rather downright terrible. Many of the beats sounded much too similiar for my liking. Then there was the brainless lyrics of songs such as ""Space Cowboy"" with it's seemingly endless, extremely annoying ""yippy yah yay"" chorus. Also, I really think that the subject matter of the song ""Digital Getdown"" is inappropriate for Nsync's target audience of young teenage girls. Of course I can't say that the CD is completely worthless...I'm sure it would make an excellent coaster...or perhaps a frisbee. :)"
1,True to its name in an instrumental sense,"True to its name in an instrumental sense. That's what this follow-up to 'N Stink's not much better debut is, as there are few strings on the entire album. Nor is there much excitement on any of them, despite the good beats of the likes of ""It's Gonna Be Me"" and ""It Makes Me Ill."" Only on ""This I Promise You"" do these guys even go half as far as the Backstreet Boys did on ""Show Me The Meaning of Being Lonely.""Don't worry, folks. This trend will be over soon `cause Andrea Bocelli in particular is a cute kitty reow."
1,zzzzzzzz...,"""nsync rules!"", ""they're so cute!"", ""they can really dance!"". wow! what convincing arguments!maybe some of you people who listen to these guys, should get a nirvana cd."
3,"Average Group, Average CD","Bye, Bye, Bye is a catchy song, but then gets annoying with the overkill airplay on the radio. The rest of the songs are trite and readily forgettable.How come all the reviews by the teenyboppers give this CD 5 Stars and claim it is the best CD ever! Can't they control their hormones and give it a more well-balanced review."
1,"Parents, be forewarned about the content of this CD","NSYNC may be the current ""big thing"" on the teen market, but parents should take heed that this CD is ruined by the inclusion of a song that is basically celebrating cybersex. (""Digital Get Down"") I was actually going to buy this CD until I listened to this track in a music store, and it disgusted me. Who in the heck does this group think their core audience is? How irresponsible of them, not to mention nauseating. I've noticed other reviewers are saying that those of us who object to this song are overreacting. Sorry, but I cannot agree. If these songs are supposed to be an extension of who this group is, there is no way I would purchase this recording for a child. (Yes, based on the strength of this ONE SONG.) I find it ludicrous that NSYNC would tackle subject matter such as this when they know for a fact that it will be heard by minors everywhere. Guys, you have too much talent to stoop this low."
2,nooooooo,"ok, i knew i liked BSB before 'no strings...' came out, but this proved it. NSYNC tried WAY to hard to make this CD more than it really was. 'bye bye bye' is played WAY to much on the radio, i did like it at FIRST, but now its just annoying me, and the only other good song is 'its gonna be me' and i just KNOW that the radios are gonna over play that too. my advice: dont bother. borrow it from a friend, or just forget about it, no point wasteing you money, or get a BSB CD instead!"
4,CD,I actually had to buy this CD for a gig I was playing. I don't usually listen to N'SYNC but it was really helpful to me. I actually liked some of the songs plus the CD was in mint condition.
3,Not an N-sync fan but....,"I don't like N-sync. But I must say that Bye,Bye,Bye was a good song when it first came out. But it got played out too much. This I promise you is a beautiful song. It is the only song I like from this group. Justin can't sing. I'm sorry. J.C made the song good. They should of just let him sing the entire song. Justin sang the entire Gone song. J.C is the only memeber in this group that sounds good. And Joey on the downlow. It's all about the BSB baby!!"
1,Who wants to play Frisbee?,"This is quite possibly the worst CD I've heard in about ten years. I loved their first album, and I thought this would be just as good. Was I WRONG! Stick with a group who can sing...Backstreet. Those boys have talent. N Sync shouldn't have pushed it; Don't even bother buying Celebrity...It's worse."
4,Downpilot Downsized,"Following 2003's ""Leaving Not Arriving"", which was a masterfully created piece, mixing hipnotic melody and great songwriting, Downpilot return with ""Like You Believe It"" another great effort but more a Paul Hiraga solo effort guided with Tucker Martine's knob twirling and studio wizardry. Every track delicate and deep embued with much care bringing to mind the best moments of many 70's artistic endevours.Paul Hiraga is a major talent whom, given the time and support will deliver a major piece of work that will leave everyone dazed and confused. For now, ""Like You Believe It"" will remain besides those other new releases that require constant revisitng for the soul."
4,Solid Belt,"After several weeks of daily use, I'm pleased with this belt. It is very well made and feels very rugged. I like the fact that it adjusts to all sizes without requiring holes as my weight tends to fluctuate a lot throughout the year at this point in my life."
1,poor poor poor,"I have several of these type belts. This one is worse than poor. The edges on the buckle are very sharp. Leading to scratching of everything: hands,cars, and furniture.The sewn in labels are all in the wrong places for tightening the belt. Junk."
2,Good stuff But for the price get a nice stainless set.,I've had scanpan for a few years now and I'm pretty happy with them except I wish I would have got the all-clad pan set instead. For the money you might as well get the stainless set it has a more durable finish than whatever these pans have. My pans are starting to get deep marks in the bottom of them and the non stick feature they advertise does seem to work for a long time but after a few years it does wear out significantly. Just my thoughts as I'm sure someone out there loves their scanies and probably has an argument to stay with them.
1,Read the books,Read the books. They are awsome one of the best book series ever made. This show is [is bad]. Morphing is only showed half the time. In the books there are intenes battles and an awsome story. In this show there are no battles just sneaking around. There are no Taxxons. The andalites look like weird mupputs and you never see there whole body at once. Ax and Visser three are always in human morph. The hork bajar look right but they don't move anywhere. They just stand there. Remember the witty and smart dialoge of the books replaced with stupid and unrehersed acting of the show. The charactors don't look like the book charactors at all. Read the books don't watch this [show].
3,"LeCreuset cookware does last ""a lifetime"".","I purchased a set of Le Creuset cookware 19 years ago. I, alone, did all the cooking and cleaning. The cookware was well cared for and never abused with burning or improper scouring.My results:The non-stick skillet is beginning to flake off large black flakes now.The sauce pans have lost their ""satin"" finishes and now take hours of soaking in bleach before food residues, especially heated milk, can be cleaned off.My experience is that Le Creuset cookware lasts approximately two decades, not a ""lifetime""."
1,Overpriced and sticks alot,"Eggs and Hashbrowns always stick to this pan regardless of heat intensity, timing of oil addition, or amount of oil. This never happened with my less expensive cast iron that was purchased at World Market. It is impossible to cook in this pan even if add a lot of extra oil adding calories and fat. The LC reputation is greatly exaggerated!"
2,Everything sticks,"Not long ago I bought a Le Creuset non-stick omelete frying pan and was very satisfied with it. The size of that pan was a bit small so I decided to buy a much bigger 11-3/4"" skillet. When I received it I discovered that it didn't come with a non-stick coating, but instead it had a ""Satin black enamel"" surface. It's just horrible - everything sticks to it, even when I use low heat and lots of oil. Now I know why Le Creuset says the pan gets better as you use it more, as it will get a special ""patina"" - probably meaning that this skillet sticks badly. Now I have to suffer from scrubbing each time after I fry something simple until the ""patina"" develops. By the way, the best way to clean a Le Creuset is baking soda! Sprinkle baking soda and add a drop of detergent, then scrub with a sponge - very effective!"
4,I LOVE IT,"This is my first piece of Le Creuset. The 11 3/4"" pan is a great size. I wanted to retire my teflon pan and I don't know why I never considered getting this pan in the first place! This skillet browns and cooks perfectly - I like the way it retains the heat to keep the food warm when it is removed from the burner. It is very easy to clean - almost as easy as teflon! After the pan cools, soak in soapy water. The pan is heavy (it's cast iron after all!) but manageable. Being a lefty I appreciate the pour spouts on both sides of the pan!I would recommend buying a silicone or potholder type sleeve to cover the handle since it does get warm.I hope to buy a Le Creuset dutch oven in the future."
2,Works good for a few months but I found Healthy Legend Ceramic coating cookware to be better,"I bought this fry pan and I hope to replace all T-Fal non-stick pan because of cancer concern from the Teflon coating. This fry pan is very heavy and it is so heavy when full of food that only my husband can handle. I am not sure what kind of non-stick coating is on this pan. I originally think it would last a life time. It only last a few months. The handle got very hot so you have to be careful. The non-stick works well for the first month. However, the surface turned black after a few months and became sticking even more than stainless steel. I had since switched to all Healthy Legend Ceramic Coated cookware with German ceramic non-toxic coating and they work good ever since. This Le Creuset is on the bottom of my storage. It is only useful for a few months."
2,Not worth the money,I own this pan and the 12 inch lodge skillet. I love the lodge pan and I am about to get rid of this one in place of a smaller lodge. I refuse to use teflon so exclusively use cast iron instead. My lodge pan and a smaller cast iron skillet I have from the 1950s get used every day but this one just sits because everything sticks and it is really hard to clean.
2,Everything sticks to this pan!,"I have a lot of Le Creuset items, and I love them all except the two frying pans, this one and another 9"". Everything sticks to them! It's just hopeless. Super difficult to clean too. I wish I could return them."
1,"The worst pan I own, everything sticks!","I love Le Creuset, my first pots were hand me downs from my mom and they've been used between the two of us for nearly 40 years! They're wonderful! And the soup pot is my absolute favorite! This skillet however is a disaster. I honestly think it should be recalled. I use medium heat and some oil and everything sticks. Potatoes or eggs are a nightmare. This morning I tried once again and finally said enough. I'll try to reseason it, but it seems beyond hope. I'm very disappointed in the quality from Le Creuset. Maybe there's an issue with a small percentage of these pans?"
5,"Reviews say it's safe, I say it works great","This skillet seems to work great. I've only used it a few times so far, but each time has been a breeze. The surface has been very easy to clean off.One reviewer was saddened by the lack of a lid for this product. While it is true that this skillet does not come with a lid, you can find Le Crueset lids for sale, even on Amazon. Just search for ""le creuset glass lid"" or click here: Le Creuset 11-3/4-Inch Tempered Glass lid."
4,Le Creuset Cast Iron Skillet,"Lovely pan, but would be nicer if the sides were a little taller. Splatters a lot and makes the bottom a mess to clean."
1,Very male chauvinist,"I disliked this novel. Deeply.The hero is sexist from chapter one to the very end. I found very disgusting that he pretended to be the masseur the heroine was expecting. It wasn't sexy at all.It seems that the novel supports this idea: if you are a woman and love your career passionately, it must be because you have a psychological problem. Apparently, it is great if your dreams get shattered. So you can devote yourself to what seems to be the natural destiny of women, marry and have children.Not to mention the topic of the gay dancer (it is not stated, but it is obvious). Of course, it must be a tragic figure. Really? New York, 1983? And the dancers had to be in the closet?I don't find a good reason to publish again this not-so-golden-oldie. If you have a feminist sensitivity, this novel is not certainly for you. And don't tell me that all 1980s novels were sexist. It's not true. Sandra Brown's are not usually so male chauvinist."
2,Average!,"This was a short story about seduction. I have nothing against seduction. I like it a lot. BUT, you have to care about the characters in order for the seduction to be touching and moving. Ms Brown writed excellent sex/love scenes, but needs to write a good story around them. Skip this book. There are many good books out there to read. Try Madeline Hunter, Mary Balough, Connie Brockway, Jo Beverley, to name a few, if you want good stories with moving intimacy."
2,Way way to predictable and sweet,I found this story to be a bit to predictable for met. It is one of the early romance stories by Sandra Brown. If you are used to her suspense stories this will be a let down.Blair is a dancer who had injured her knees and moves to a small town where a former dancer friend of hers lives. In this town she meets her landlord and a romance blooms....This refers to the abridged audio tape version. It may be better in book form it seemed way to predictable in this form.
1,Five stars for this?,"I am a young adult librarian- and I am stunned this book does not have any negative reviews. This book has a laundry list of inexcusable issues: the character of the mother is as one-dimensional as they come, the dialogue is laughable, the resolution of the story is so implausible and unbelievable. The protaganist fights back against lies, stalking, and peeping toms- by lying, stalking, and turning into a peeping tom. It's all just nauseating trash."
5,Great book for all ages,"I originally bought this for my teenage niece but when it got to my house I flipped through it and then ended up finishing it the next day, it was so funny. Floey was a very believable teenager and I grew up outside Providence, so there were a lot of things in it that reminded me of growing up there (e.g. going into town to listen to bad poetry). It's really worth reading and I'd really recommend it."
2,An expensive plastic bag! Save your money!,"I received the Aquapac yesterday and what a joke! For that much money I expected something a little more substantial and I was actually embarassed to show it to my girlfriend (yes she laughed) It's nothing more than a clear rubber bag with a nice waterproof seal. You stuff the camcorder into it and film through the rubber. Over time I would expect it to get scratched up to the point where the video quality would suffer even more. With proper care and feeding it should live longer though.I would pay $20 for this product and be happy with it, at it's current price though it's getting sent back. At this point I think my solution for a dust/splash shield will be to buy some good quality sandwich bags and a lense filter.The bottom line is if you need something waterproof, spend the extra money to get a good product that will last. You'll be wasting your money with this expensive plastic bag!"
4,Good,"Mine has only three of those ribbons, not 4! in photo it is shown that there are 4 of those ribbons.but in general it is beautiful I love it"
2,"Cute, Comes apart easily.",Charms fall off easyPlasticDoes not stretch wellbeads very tightly spacedcharms do not hang nicely must be pushed into place
1,Good idea... but LEAKS!,"I was excited to finally get my hose situation sorted out. Installed this thing and it leaks like crazy. It's the correct size for my hose 3/4"". Bummed."
3,"Fun toy, darts a little flimsy...","This is a fun toy to have...if you buy 2 guns! The darts are a little flimsy, so after several uses, it's hard to get them back in the gun because they just get squashed. Hard to cock for anyone under the age of 5. Fun toy overall."
2,"Don't buy, not worth it","Although it is a cheap item, I would not recommend it, even for free:- The handle is way too small unless you're 4-year old or younger.- The hole around the trigger is also too small for a typical finger to go through.- The darts don't go very far, maybe like 10 feet. Forget about any accuracy.- The darts are a bit smaller is diameter than the Nerf branded ones so you can't easily mix them all.Anyway, I would suggest you don't buy this gun."
4,A watershed for Simple Minds,"I bought this on tape back in '85 based on the appeal of ""Don't You (Forget About Me)"" and thought that song would be on this album. I was disappointed to learn the band had deliberately left out that song because it wasn't the sound they were going for, but I was pleased this album was still very listenable. ""Alive and Kicking"" is my favorite track as well as being a smash hit. The piano interlude on that song is genius. I also like ""Sanctify Yourself,"" ""Ghostdancing"" and ""All the Things She Said."" Charlie Burchill's guitar work is stellar and Jim Kerr has a great pop voice backed by excellent harmonies. I can understand why this was Simple Minds' international breakthrough."
2,The end for Simple Minds,"Beeing a hardcore fan of Simple Minds for some years, this one was the stop for me. ""Alive and kicking"" is a pretty good track but the rest is nothing special. What a disappointment. Was it the leave of Derek Forbes that did it ? Perhaps we will never know. Maby they got to big through their major hit ""Dont' you forget about me"" and sold their souls to the americans. Played the big stadiums and got commercial. I can recommend all albums before this one though."
5,The best by Simple Minds,"I own a lot of simple minds albums, but this is simply the best one of them all. It would have been perfect if it included Don't you(Forget about me). Still is one of the best albums I own."
5,"Turn all worries over to God, even the little stuff, Funny,","This book is a lesson in everyday life. It teaches us to honnor the difference in people not shy away from them. It teaches acceptance with a smile. Relates to my life in so many ways. Wish I could turn everything, including my selfwill and a sick dog, over to God and have the patients to wait for an answer. Wonderfully sweet and I feel after reading all 5 books that I have another family that lives in Mitford and I would dearly love to go visit them. Wish I had a friend like Miss Sadie, all full of wisdom and starch. A blessing to read and hopefull retain."
4,Enjoyable stories although not really a novel,"Besides his growing feelings for Cynthia, Father Tim's life is complicated by a lustful widow, his young ward Dooley, a killer blizzard, and various town problems.As in the first book, there is no real plot, more a series of short stories. But it's still enjoyable and held my attention all the way through. I particularly liked that both Cynthia and Father Tim openly sought the Lord's will for their relationship."
1,"This will be hugely unpopular, but...","I've read all the reviews posted here and can see I'm in a tiny minority of folks who've read this, but I can't for the life of me see what this book is about. Nothing ever happens, just talk, talk, talk, and a lot of feel-goodism. The word ""leisurely"" has been used a lot, and that's putting it kindly. Books should be stimulating, not stultifying. Sorry to all the Mitford Fans, but I just can't like these books."
2,Prejudiced?,"This book,the second in the series, is mildly entertaining, as is the first. But it seems that the author considers a perfect town to consist of a variety of Protestant denominations, with nary a Catholic, a Jew, or anyone else. In this volume, she has one of the characters say ""My grandpa said he never met a Catholic that knew pea turkey about th' Bible"". Now, this book was written in 1995; I might have expected such an anti-Catholic remark in a book from 100 years earlier, but I was surprised and put off by this sentence in a book from 1995. I guess a cozy little town peopled only by Protestants might appeal to a certain demographic, but it seems a rather closed society to me."
1,Series INCOMPLETE for Kindle ... Don't Start Series!,If you have a Kindle - Best not start this series. The third book is not available for Kindle. Why only some books in a SERIES is made available is beyond me. Either pass on the Kindle or Pass on the Series
1,Overpriced!,"After I purchased this item from Amazon and gave it as a gift, I found the exact same thing, brand new, at an outlet bookstore for $20 less. Make sure to compare prices. I was very disappointed!"
2,Disappointing,"After reading the reviews, I was hoping for a really nice, light read. I found the two main characters in the story to be very self indulgent and whiny. From the titles I assume that they eventually get married. I have to assume that later in the series both Cynthia and Father Tim become less consumed with their own feelings. Maybe some heavy editing would have helped the story."
2,Great story - Bad cover,"The story is great, but the book cover could really use some major improvement. When it arrived, the cover was already curled up before I took it from the box. Since I've been reading it, the cover remains curled and seems to get worse with time. I usually pass my paperbacks on to others for their reading enjoyment, but this one is a bit embarrassing to pass on due to the curled book cover. So, it will probably go into File 13 or collect dust somewhere."
5,The Mitford series is a definite delightful surprise,"Wow, from the first of the series to the end of the last of the four books, I couldn't put the excellent works down. Even the question and answer's with the author were informative. If you want to feel good and feel better about the world then this is a must read series."
4,Just right for the middle aged someone,I found the entire series just right for me at this age.I'm 64 and I identify with the entire village.All of the folks in Mitford are my friends.
5,Mitford is Like Coming Home!,"In this continuing book, (sequel), of At Home in Mitford, Father Tim's attractive neighbor Cyhthia Coppersmith is at his door, pursuing Father Tim with hot casseroles. Then, his cousin Meg has moved into the rectory for the long haul, disturbing his whole household! Dooley, the boy Father Tim has taken under his wing in the first story, is still living with Father Tim and causing problems in school. They can't seem to locate his mother, and his father is a terrible drunkard.This book is truly as enjoyable as the first one was, and well worth the reading time!"
4,A Light in the Window,"I happened upon the Mitford Years series at our local library and promptly fell in love with the stories. Our library had every book in the series except ""A Light in the Window"". thus I was able to read the entire series in a matter of weeks, one after the other. The problem...I wanted more.The stories are beautifully written - I did think Father Tim, the Episcopal minister was more than a little dense when it came to romance but given the fact he was in his 60's and had never been in love nor been married, I suppose it was understandable to an extent. However, he nearly lost his chance to be with this incredible creative lady he belatedly proposed to.The way the people in the town are incorporated into the story is beautiful, you come to know and care for all of them.Beautiful book, beautiful series!"
5,A Light in the Window,"I recently discovered the Mitford Series and have completed books one through 6. A Light in the Window is book two in this charming and captivating series. I had just finished reading a few very heavy books that were wonderful, but draining, and was looking for something light and fun to read. When I began reading the first book in the Mitford Years series I was completely hooked, and now finishing book six I have not been disappointed. I find myself reading and wishing to live in a little town like Mitford."
5,Book,Awesome book series! My sister in law gotted me hooked on this and it is a great book. Would highly recommend it.
3,Annoying connector problems,the power and antenna connectors get loose and loses power and or antenna sometimes when you hit a bump. Quite annoying.
4,a days read,very good and engrossing book. read it over the course of an afternoon. great summer reading
5,Great book!,"I ordered this book for my Dad only to find he already owned it. When I received it I refused the order and Amazon still charged me shipping, even after I called within hours of my order to cancel and they could not help me. BUt I would recommend this book if you are looking for some good trail food?Casey"
5,Great cook book,This book is full of quick and easy recipes that taste good. My family used recipes from this book on a 9-day road trip and saved a ton of cash by not eating out every day. The easy clean up and little need for cooking equip make this a great camping cook book.
3,"Tasty, but not as Eco-Friendly as Expected","My husband was so impressed with the recipes in this book. Most of them (if not all) are easily made vegan. Many of them are easy to prepare and there are simple tiny instructions in the back for copying and taking with you. It makes it very convenient.I was surprised that the author used ziplock bags for holding food (sometimes even for rehydrating it). I haven't purchased zip lock backs in over 5 years because they take so long to biodegrade! I was shocked that a book about exploring nature was so dependent on them. I realize that this is the tradition in backpacking, but I was disappointed."
4,MTX is a great motorcyle game,this game is great ist easy to controll your bike and create trix.its fun as you start a career and earn money and new bikes to make it to the top.
3,Mixed results,"The Aquapaq is a great idea, but in reality there are several issues one must keep in mind. 1- There is no written docs to tell you how deep you can go. 2- For pool use, the thing is tough to keep down in the water. I recommend draining as much air out of it as possible so you can control the buoyancy. 3- In lakes and oceans, make sure it floats so you can retrieve it if it gets away from you. 4- The plastic is not exactly optical quality. It is worse out of the water, because folds created by extending the lens (such as the Kodak camera in the pictures) create distortions. 5- It is VERY difficult to frame. You can't really use the LCD in bright light and looking throught the viewfinder with goggles is almost impossible. Shoot from the hip and hope for the best.After all these points, I was able to get ONE PERFECT PICTURE of my son underwater. Made it all worthwile, but be patient."
4,I think is a good camera for the price!,"I bought this camera a few months ago, and I wasnt expeting too much, this the first digital camera I get. So I was scare about the resolution not being that good. Although, it is not as good as an ordinary camera. It serves its purpose and allow me to have aceptable photographs of my family, to send all over the web. So, I can say I am happy with that!"
4,An enjoyable collection,"I picked this collection up so that I could figure some of these songs out. Its a highly enjoyable record that offers a variety of sound. Usually, I associate hokum songs with sexual innuendo, and there's some of that here too, but there's also songs of gambling and a couple that play out more like comic skits/ musical sampler.The rough, scratchy sound of some of the songs, a result of their having been lifted from worn 78s; really attests to just how rare the tunes are. One must wonder how many songs of the era are now lost forever."
2,I remember this song,"it was a group of 4 women sitting in mens shirts and lingerie singing about putting the X in your sex. The song is OK, the women weren't nothing to look at, too much weave not enough make up. But they had a single and I don't so what does that say...."
5,The bolero on this one....,"I'm just writting this up so you know that the bolero ""reflexionando"" featured in this album is one of the best ever to be put on record. Dalto's piano solo is desgarrante. It kind of hurts to hear him feel that way. He was very ill at the moment and died shorlty afterwards. Listening to this piece you'll find an artist letting go of everything for nothing... Great... The whole album pays... in case you were just wondering."
4,The acoustic track is worth the price alone,Take the time and space to enjoy a smooth groove like this
3,Hear the funky bass and DANCE!,"Funky Stuff ...funky stuff ...I like it, I mean track 2 it's very nice but I coudn't find the other tracks by searching for them(MP3)of these remixes except funky stuff remix & the normal one SPACE !"
1,NEXT PLEASE-,"If you want to get an idea of the types of animals that are available to photograph at the Triple D Game Farm, then buy this book. If you have hopes of learning anything from this book, pass it up. The only thing one learns from this book is that you wasted your money."
5,Don't stop get it get it...,"I highly reccommend this disc from the Groove Collective because of the pure sound from real instruments and the feeling that I get with each play. I own the album from which these singles came from but by far the mixes will leave you wanting more. Saturday Afternoon, Nerd, Rentstrike and Buddaha Head are worth giving a listen to as well."
2,Disappointing Collection from a Talented Artist,"Everyone should have a Brian Kennedy album in their collection, but unfortunately, this is not the one that I would go for. A rather tame and bland affair from one of my most favourite singers sees him drifting into mediocracy. There are 2 CD's here with the acoustic sessions easily the better of the two. The highlight of the album is 'Silver Hearts on Chains' written in collaboration with Eddie Reader, who also shares some background vocals. A beautiful song of lost love and a life wasted to alcohol. Destination, Every Song Is A Cry for Love', 'Turn on Me' and the title track 'Homebird' are all good but do not do enough to lift the album. The voice, as always, is superb, production is a little too 'clean' for my liking (almost like listening to backing tracks)...I felt a little short-changed with this one."
3,Good concept but....,"The idea of a cutter that can have dual uses is an awesome idea. However, it falls a little short. We wanted to use the straight side to cut hamburger buns. The jagged side cuts into your palms until they are pretty sore if you do very many. Cutter works good and is fairly solid. Like the variety of sizes. It will be ok to cut such things as soft cookie doughs. If you want something for a more solid yeast dough I'd suggest looking somewhere else."
4,scalloped and plain round shapes,"I only realized when I took these out of the box that the ""handle"" end could be used to make circles. These are a thin sharp plastic. They are the best price for what they can do of all the cookie cutter sets. I finally decided on these after reading Chocolate and Zucchini's tool reviews. Now my shortbread cookies will no longer be Salvador Dali-esque. Cookies are very unhealthy so I am happy to get this smaller set for ten dollars instead of the larger Ateco metal sets for Round and Crinkle shapes that would have cost $30."
3,good for the price,"They are not the best quality but get the job done.Good value for money. So, you'd surely not regret buying these."
5,Great price for this set!,I am very happy with this purchase. All the different sizes and the two different sides. I really feel like I got a deal. They work well. Easier than the jar I was using for my biscuits.
5,Very nice and love the small space it takes up,"I get scalloped and regular cutters in every size I need in a sweet ""Russian doll"" storage system (the small fits inside the next largest, etc.). They work wonderfully on short bread and regular doughs. The price was great. Love them."
5,"Vintage Rubalcaba, a must!","I'm a long time fan of mr. rubalcaba, having heard him for the first time in his amazing rendition of agua de beber, performed at the concert for jobim organized by herbie hancock...I was mesmerized then, only to be once more struck by the uncanny resourcefulness of this pianist-composer...I agree witht he last commentator, this CD realy is arguablly his best, in terms of live energy , compositions, and soloings..While his latest cd's, inner voyage and Supernova offer a new insight into the musician who is in constant search of new directions and perhaps a more mature Rubalcaba, no doubt this here is the stuff legends are made of.."
4,Interesting and informative,"I found this an interesting and informative look at the Northwest Indians. My Grandfather, Thomas Wildcat Alford, also wrote about our tribe, the Shawnees, (Civilization--University of Oklahoma Press) This book should add enjoyment to a trip among the Montana tribes. Recommended!"
3,Mediocre at best!!!,"My husband bought this car seat for his SUV because it was ""Eddie Bauer"" and it matched his vehicles interior perfectly. However, after using this seat for over a year we have come to hate this seat. The harness is difficult to fasten and the cushioning keeps coming loose. The belt positioner is flimsy as well. I have the Graco CarGo Platinum in my vehicle and it is a much more sturdy and easy to use."
3,NOT GOOD FOR YOUNGER CHILDREN,"My husband and I use this as a spare seat for our 22 month old son. I like how light it is since we travel a lot by air, and how it is pretty easy to install. But I am conserned about how my son who is 25 pounds fits in it. He is constantly slumped in a corner even when the straps are as tight as can be. My nephew who is the same age but heavier has the same problem. It just does not seem safe if an accident were to occur, it seems to lack support. We are now thinking of buying a Britax Marathon as our main car seat and using our Cosco Alpha Omega (which we love) as the spare. Hopefully it will work better when our son is 3 or 4, but I really feel that it is unsafe for a child any younger than that of an average size."
2,it's just ok,I have a few problems with this seat. The first weekend we used the new booster seat my 3-1/2 yr. old had an accident. I had to take the entire thing apart just to wash the cover. It took me at least 45 minutes to put the thing back together. Installation is difficult because I use the latch system and the strap is sewn in so you cant tighten the latch as much as you would like to. The rear strap is too short and extremely difficult to change the length. It takes me forever to install to my satisfaction adjusting here and there. The headrest is in a weird place. The strap which you pull to tighten the five point harness always gets stuck. I would buy a different brand next time.
2,Didn't work for us,"I labored long & hard over which to buy. My oldest daughter is a very tall & thin 2 1/2 year old. We have a Britax Marathon(love it) for her now, but she is very close to being too tall for it & too skinny & young for a regular booster seat. And with the addition of our newest baby, we are looking to move her into a convertible booster.PROS: Easy to climb in & out of, the seat belt guides for when you use the car's seat belt is nice(the main reason I bought it).CONS: The headrest is uncomfortable, the hard rivets in the back of the seat are uncomfortable, the chest buckle is RIDICULOUSLY simple to undo, but the BIGGEST FAILURE of all is the LATCH system: there is a tether that is sewn into the middle of the LATCH belt. Thereby, inhibiting the ability to tighten it down. We have a 2001 Nissan Quest minivan & this car seat was unsafe in our van. I ended up with an Evenflo Traditions."
4,this seat LASTS!!!,"we have two of these, one is for our 7 yr old and we bought it when he was 2 and he still uses it!!! it has held up amazing! so we bought our 3 yr old one last yr and his is great too! sure the pillow is a little worthless but other then that I HAVE NO IDEA why these people complain....the 5 pt harness is great! and for the price??? well worth it! my boys like how they can see out when they are in this..I highly recomnmed this for this price range!"
2,"Nice seat, but the specifications on this site are not correct...","I bought this because the manufacturer's description stated that it is for a one-year old that is 20 pounds. I went to Babies-R-Us and bought it and was told the same thing. After I arrived home, I saw on the box that it is only for children one year old, 22 POUNDS, AND AT LEAST 34 INCHES TALL. This is a problem since most one-year olds I know are not anywhere near 34 inches."
5,Love this carseat!,"I bought this carseat to use in my car for my granddaughter. Her mom and dad bought the same one and told me about it. After searching intently for one, I bought this one after my daughters' suggestion. My granddaughter loves this carseat, it's easy to put in and is very well padded. I would highly recommend this carseat to any one!!"
2,"Excellent delivery, but covered in oil.","Metalgrip LLC 1/4-20 SHCS.Bolts more or less as advertised, very quick delivery. Bolts arrived covered in oil. If you like your bolts in an oil slick, then these are for you."
3,Saint Etienne - Hug My Soul,"The infectiously catchy HUG MY SOUL is buttered up for club use on the American compilation of the two UK singles. Sadly, though, it neglects one of the b-sides. Thankfully, the other two B-sides showcase Saint Etienne's rock tendencies admirably -- and you've got to love the sweet irony of ""I Buy American Records."" As for the mixes themselves, Sure is Pure do an OK job, rather bland, considering the source material. Juan 'Kinky' Hernandez goes for a light and stripped-down house mix, while Motiv 8 pump up the energy. But Secret Knowledge does the most interesting work, making the track into a stomper with some minor key undertones."
2,Poor warranty coverage,"This cookware is supposed to have a lifetime warranty....if you can get anybody to cover it. The manufacturer says to contact the distributor, and the distributor is unresponsive. Pretty expensive cookware that doesn't hold up as it is supposed to do."
3,KEEP THE BOX,I CRACKED TWO EGGS ON THE TOP EDGE OF THE PAN AND IT CHIPPED THE VERY FIRST TIME THAT I USED IT! IT WILL ONLY BE A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THAT CHIP SPREADS AND I WILL BE SENDING IT BACK.I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WHEN I SAW THE CHIP.AN EGG SHELL? COME ON!REAL TOUGH STUFF! I ONLY USE PLASTIC UTENSILS WITH IT AND NOW CRACK EGGS WITH SOMETHING ELSE OVER THE PAN. HEATS EVEN AND NOTHING STICKS. CLEANS UP EASY WHEN WARM. I ALSO GOT A T-FAL PAN AT THE SAME TIME. I'LL USE THEM BOTH ABOUT THE SAME AND COMPARE. SO FAR ALL THAT I CAN SAY IS SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO WITHOUT BEING DISAPPOINTED.
1,"False Advertisement, this pan should not go in the dishwasher","The pan we got started oxidizing on the bottom from day one. The company says it is dishwasher safe but the bottom should not oxidize if it is. One of the main reasons we bought this pan above others was the company saying it is dishwasher safe. I wrote the company and they said that the oxidation was normal, not a defect, just scrub it off with an SOS pad. No way I should have to scrub a pan with an SOS when it just came out of the dishwasher. As expensive as this pan is, you would think it would do what it says."
2,filling up the landfill,"We were really excited when we bought our Scanpan. We had been buying a new nonstick skillet once a year since forever because no matter how expensive they were they still needed to be replaced about once a year. We were tired of filling up the landfill. Unfortunately, after about 4 months, our Scanpan skillet got sticky. Our morning eggs stuck worse than on our $20.00 cast iron skillet. We had followed all the directions, but still . . .We sent it back to the company (fortunately, we had saved the box and the receipt) and for a $10.95 shipping fee we got another. It lasted for about 8 months before it got sticky. Yes, we can send the 2nd one back too - again, and again, and again. This isn't what we had hoped for when we spent nearly $100.00 on this skillet! The land fill gets fuller and fuller and we're spending as much as year as we did before when we bought the cheap $20.00 pan from Costo.Yes, it's nice and flat and heats evenly, but that's about all I can say for it."
3,only 7 songs wtf?,It is a decent CD but they are much more interesting live. I saw them open for the kooks in SF and they killed it but the cd is a little boring and emo. And 7 tracks on a cd?
4,Fascinating but over my head,"Having studied college-level physics, biology, chemistry and calculus many years ago, I thought I would have a bit more than just the fundamental knowledge necessary to understand the scientific language and ideas presented in this book. However, I had to quickly turn pages because I was unable to comprehend most of the ideas. It was a shame because I am deeply intrigued by the topic and was looking for something that would further explain some of my questions. It's likely I took on more than I could chew as the average layman, but I was under the impression upon buying it that a science-minded person could decipher 80% of it. Nevertheless, I will probe even deeper into the subject -- Tiller's book did not cause my interest to wane."
1,Science + Superstition = Nonsence,I cannot believe this man is a professor at Stanford University. I was looking for a book that would present a scientific explanation for unexplained phenomenon. This book is pseudoscience and superstition from a mind stuck in a christian paradigm.
3,Uneven music by uneven performers,Only a mediocre score with too many sound-alike duets and ballads. Betty Buckley and Susan Egan do their best to make it all sound better than it really is. F. Murray Abrahams butchers the score so badly its his worst crime since he killed Mozart in Amadeus.
4,Two of Boradway's finest divas shine,Betty Buckley and Susan Egan are absolutely wonderful in Triumph of Love. This is a fun muscial which is a great avenue for both of these Boradway divas to showcase their talent. Both of their voices are a joy to listen to again and again.
4,A Hidden Treasure,"This production was short lived in NY but it still boasts some of the most beautiful and fun music as well as some of the best talent (Susan Egan, Betty Buckley, Christopher Sieber, and F. Murrary Abraham). A Must buy for any musical fan."
2,Not much to like,"Not my cup of tea. I am a fan of almost every actor and actress on this CD, but I just couldn't get through it. The music is bland and the lyrics try to hard. The end result is disinteresting. Maybe it is better in context on stage, but as a recording it failed to interest me."
3,Slow reading,"This book is a much slower read than the typical Dresden files book. Great book if you are having trouble sleeping as the action is severely lacking until the end of the book. Relative to the concept of Fury elementals, they lacked the depth one would like to see written into them. This first book in the series is a little raw and a little disappointing. Hopefully, the second one is better."
3,Competent,"This book was a competent novel, but nothing really special. It seemed like Butcher had trouble bringing the various stories into their climactic moments at the same time -- it often felt a little bit forced.I'm going to stick with the series, because I hear that they get better, and the same was definitely true of the Harry Dresden books."
4,fun fantasy conflict,This was my first book by Jim Butcher. It's an easy to read fantasy revolving around three primary plots that tie together well at the end.i am looking forward to reading the rest in the series.
3,The Furies of Calderon,"I absolutely adore Butcher's Harry Dresden; innovative and clever with a voice in character that is credible. I found The Furies... to be too predictable. Interesting story line and interesting characters, however no one grabbed me as Harry has done. I am finished with the series and will wait patiently for the next adventure Harry has from the grave."
4,Enjoyed it,"I found the way elementals were used to be rather interesting. I did find the whole Citizen situation a bit confusing at times, but I figure it would be better laid out in subsequent books.The action was a bit slow as some foundation was laid for the reader to better understand what was going on. But then about a third of the way through, it picked up quite a bit.The Furies of Calderon I felt was a fun read and am looking forward to the next in the series. Jim Butcher is a very good writer."
2,Exhausting...,"I actually liked Butchers writing, and thought the overall story line was good, but had to give up this read because I became increasing tired of the non-stop violence on his poor characters. They rarely get any rest or sleep, are almost constantly getting beat up, raped, buried, strangled, punched, burned, stabbed, and attacked by magical creatures (furies) who seem to have no will of their own and are just plain nasty. I gave it up during the rape and domination scene - it was just too much! Give these poor folks a few hours of sleep!"
2,Was this book really a dare?,"I read that this book was a dare to the author to take the worst ideas one could come up with dealing with fantasy and make them good. Well I read this book and I agree and disagree. It was said that he was challenged with the ideas of Pokemon and the Roman Civilisation. I thought that the pokemon aspect of the book was gods awful. I hated the whole notion of 'furies'. The Roman Civilisation however I thought was a pretty good idea and played out fairly well. This book didn't work for me though. I didn't care for the overall storie, nor the characters, nor what happens to them. It was almost a struggle for me to finish. I will not be picking up the second installment, and I would not recommend this one, the first. There is plenty of other books based on bad, or overused ideas that come out much better."
4,Great Read for The Fantasy Addicts,For me this book was like finding a diamond in the rough. There are a lot of good fantasy writers out there and this book has just joined the club. It's a fast and intense read with many twists and turns that keeps you waiting for more. I can't wait for Book Two in The Codex Alera.
2,Maybe it's just not for me,"I like Butcher's Dresden books as an interesting diversion, so I decided to give this series a try. Honestly, I never made it to the end of Book One.I think one thing that's missing here that Butcher managed to instill in the Dresden books is that I never really cared about the characters in this series. Every night, sitting down to read, I'd heave a sigh and pick this book up before finally admitting to myself that I just didn't care about these characters, didn't care whether they lived or died, and was really starting to root for the latter to happen so that it would just end.His writing is still good, but not nearly as snappy as in the Dresden series, and the dialog seems stilted. Okay, sure, older times, more formal perhaps, but I don't buy that.Wife loves this series almost as much as Dresden, so maybe it's just not the genre for me."
1,It's really bad,"The Dresden Files prove that Butcher can write, worldbuild and direct compelling characters. This book has none of these qualities - the action and world are full of holes, with paper-thin characters acting in improbably, unbelievable and cliched patters of interaction.The only reasonable explanation I have is that the books have been written by someone Jim is close to and that he has lent his name to them. If you enjoy the Dresden files and the works of authors like Hobb, Rothfuss or Martin, stay away."
4,Am I over 13?,"Am I over 13? What kind of question is that?Mr. Butcher is one of the best out there, even if he has more hair on his head than I have on my entire body."
1,"Juvenile, misogynistic, and contrived.....","This author has some latent hostility towards women. Things start off fine as a sort of cookie-cutter high-fantasy in a male dominated culture where most women seem to be slaves, sex objects, or man-less feminist stereotypes. Then all of a sudden it's time for the gang-rape scene. One of the main female characters is forced to watch while another is drugged, gang-raped, and then tortured with a magic dog collar. Classy. All of the ""drama"" leading up to the climax is is so forced that it makes no sense. If you replaced all of the bafflingly mean, obtuse, sexist, and poorly written characters with normal people who acted sanely, this story would only be about half as long. The author had such a ridiculously thin plot to work through, that he was forced to pad this story with inane confrontaions and nonsensical arguments to fill the pages. I find it sad that this garbage passes for ""popular fiction"". What a waste."
5,A Great New Novel,"While dealing with a kind of fantasy standard of the furies this book is really creative and interesting. The pace is great and really keeps you involved without short changing the character development. The characters are all very well develped and interesting, even the bad guys. It is nice that the book has a action filled center, but a deeper more evolved intrigue to keep you thinking as things develope. I would highly recommend this book and its sequel to fantasy lovers and novices."
5,"Non-stop action, intrigue, and suspense!","This is the first book I've read by Jim Butcher. I think I'll go by every book he's ever written if ""Furies of Calderon"" is any indication of his writing style. I loved this book!! He had me sitting on the edge of my seat throughout the entire thing. Don't buy into the complaints of other reviewers. Read it and judge for yourself. If you go into it expecting some form of reality based story, you may very well be disappointed. To that I say, choose another book then. But if you love fantasy, as well as action and suspense, then this is the book for you. Enjoy it! I'm going to get the hardback edition and add it to my collection."
4,The land and people of Alera,"A good start on a new series. Wish it was as amusing as the Dresden files series, but I'm willing to be coaxed into the story. Knowing that this is a new series means there's no real resolution to the plot for however long the series goes on. It's hard to keep up with lots of different characters being introduced and no real handle on some of the intrigue that's sure to come.The furycrafting isn't really explained in such a way that the reader ""gets it"" but it does come out more in the subsequent title."
2,Terrible prose destroys a decently realized world,"This is my first Jim Butcher book, and it will be my last. His prose is simply terrible. I understand that fantasy fans have low expectations for writing quality, but this book is in a whole other category."
1,Not even close to description,"I bought this book for over $100 dollars and they said it was new, with a couple rips in dust jacket; I got it and it has had something either spilled on or left by previous owners hands, plus some bent pages. All in all this book was deffinetley not new."
4,"A rough start, but still very good","Like the first Harry Dresden book, the first few chapters of this book are a little awkward. The dialogue and descriptions do not flow well, at first. DO NOT give up on the book picks up and comes together quickly after that awkward section. If this series is anything like the Dresden series, there shouldn't be anymore awkwardness after this first book."
5,FANTASTIC,"So enjoyable! I just finished this book tonight and I cant wait to start on book 2. I absolutely loved this book. Non stop action/ fantasy, humorous.. and a little romance to go with it. All you could want in a good read. Loved it!"
3,Just ok.,"Mr. Butcher does a good job with character development and with a ""magic"" system. And 80% of the way through the book it probably was 4 star worthy. But the end really fell apart. An epic battle that got a little boring and confusing, and a super cheesy, expected ending lost it at least another star (it ended up more of a 2 1/2 to be honest). Let me put it this way. I might read the next book if I really can't find anything to read, and I really want something to read. That's a lot of qualifiers."
3,could be a lot better,"Basic fare for this type of novel. If the characters would only stop doing the old ""now I must go do something noble"" routine (say this in the same voice that John Stewart does his queen of England imitation), it would relieve some of the sugary sweetness. There were so many parts of this book that had me rolling my eyes with the unrelenting triteness. Blech. Characters are one dimensional. Every bad guys either beats children and abuses women or else is an incompetent coward. Every good guy is ridiculously noble. Painful.Because this is Jim Butcher, I read the second book and it got a bit better -- plot points that were begun in this first book were added too in a good way. Triteness level is down a bit. Then the third and fourth books were pretty good. I'm on the fifth book and the author seems to have run out of plot, seems to meander with no particular point. Fingers crossed that it gets better."
2,Meh.,"Since I enjoyed The Dresden Files so much, I gave this a try. I was bored. I give two stars. One for trying, one for making me wish it was better. I suspect this would have been better if written right to the 10-year-olds, and not as adult fiction. Yes, that is how thin I thought it was. Sorry, Mr. Butcher."
3,A Mixed Bag,"There's a lot I really liked about this book. It starts off with a bang by introducing a fabulous Roman-esque world with some neat twists on fantasy magic. But the book never really explores all that good stuff. We're introduced to it, and then immediately plunged into action scene after action scene, culminating in a mammoth (and eventually unrealistic) battle. Don't get me wrong: I love action scenes. But I would have liked them better had the story had a little more character context and a little more world exploration under its belt first. Three and a half stars and I'll be tentatively checking out the sequel, hoping for more of the good stuff and less of the bad."
4,"Apparently, the universal sign of a character's nervousness in this book is licking their lips.","There's nothing else to say about this book that hasn't already been said. I decided to pick this up after reading the first of the Dresden Files and enjoyed it quite a bit. It does it's job well enough in introducing a new world and the characters are likeable. I'll be reading the rest of the series.One thing bothered me though, just a minor gripe. It seemed like every time Jim wanted to convey uneasiness or anticipation in his characters he would use the action of them, ""licking their lips"". It's used so often that I started to laugh about it towards the end of the book."
5,Outstanding,Outstanding book from Butcher in a fantasy setting. I've enjoyed the Dresden Files from Butcher and wanted to give the Furies of Calderon a try. I was cautious how Butcher's style would cross over to a fantasy setting. I'm happy to say I was reall impressed. Butcher delived great fantasy action with an excellent plot and captivating new world.
5,Shepherd-hero's story which worked!,"How boring can be a story about a young shepherd becoming an emperor? Well, this one is not! If you like your fantasy smart and funny and with a lot of twists in the plot, you must read this.First four books were amazing and brilliant, last two were a bit boring - just one long battle with the Zergs Queen and no character development or really smart tricks.Overall 4.5/5 and highly recommended."
3,interesting but abrupt in plot development,"The general storyline is exciting and fresh. Some of the elements seemed forced and unnecessary, such as the fits of passion and lust. The story would have benefited from deeper plot development without these aspects. I plan to read on in the series to see if Butcher evolves his writing to build out the characters and storyline further. It has good potential."
3,Good but dissapointing,"I found the book quite enjoyable, but found the many spacing and syntax errors in the digital copy very annoying and therefore can not give this book the due credit it may deserve based on the story it represented. I only hope that they can fix the errors for future readers of the digital version of this book."
3,Getting his footing,I love the Dresden files and the quick wit and such Butcher plays with but this book seemed to drag more and maybe the reason is the style he is using is different and the story longer. I plan to give the series a chance and see if it improves though on the whole something to check out and enjoy till the next Dresden novel comes out.
5,Wonderfully written story,I read all of the Dresden files and decided to give these a try. The story is truly unique and easy to read. I cannot wait to read the rest of them
3,Average means average--let's not over do it.,"I am suprised that this novel has gained so many 5 star reviews. Dont' get me wrong, it's a good read but it doesn't deserve to be at the top of the class.Overall, the story is interesting and essentially ""fresh."" Although, most fantasy authors these days strive to do things differently. Personally, I find that annoying because I never get what I'm expecting. How can people continually compare new fantasy to Tolkien when it doesn't even distantly resemble his novel?Most of the dialogue in ""Furies"" is cheesey at best. Not to mention they speak in modern english rather than an older dialect, which is odd if you ask me. It's also incredibly annoying.I have to say though, that the battle at the end had me on edge. Was is the best battle I've ever read? No.Thus, 3 stars. Because the novel doesn't suck (1) and it's not great (5)."
2,Blah,"The characters often seem cartoonish and the dialogue is wooden and fake. I had to put it down after one of the characters said, ""Oh Goodie,"" at the thought of having a chance to kill something. I mean, come on!"
2,"Less fiction, more facts please.",This book reads more like an Autobiography on the writer than it does a textbook about Maya. It has some good 'basic' tips on Mental Ray in one of the last chapters but other than that I found it very frustrating to read and impossible to use as a reference library due to the messy structure. There are much better books out there.
1,What a rip-off!,"The song is alright but he cd single is a rip-off. All the remixes are edited. So why shouldn't the price be edited? I mean back when the single was out it was around $5 while the single would have been $2.99. If you want the long versions, you will have to buy the vinyl 12"" single."

3,Interesting book,"I found the book to give only some general guidance in understanding Elliott Wave. Personally, I got much more specific information from ""How to Identify High-Profit Elliott Wave Trades in Real Time"" by Myles Wilson Walker."
2,No Practical Value.,"I buy books that include trading strategies source code that you can apply and trade, books like this have no practical value. If the author have BS comouter science, he should be able to write the source code."
3,Not much new information,"Its an OK book without much appeal for a serious student of Elliott Waves.This is one of these books that feel like an author wanted to have a right to say ""I wrote a book on the subject"".If you read Neely 15 times and actually GET it (that is usually how long it takes :) , you do not need this book. If not, this book won't make much difference.Not to say anything negative about author's knowledge or experience, G-d forbid. He seem like a very knowledgable person. But knowing something and teaching it - are two different things."
1,Highly disorganized book without real value,"The book is easy to read but there isn't much of a content in it. There is no definite EW analysis system step-by-step. Just some elaboration on the topic all the way through and some examples. It doesn't teach anything. And there is definitely no trading system. It was probably intended as a tool for general prediction only. The book is not for traders at all. Perhaps, it is for market analysts.The author shows how others use or interpret Elliot Waves Theory improperly. But he doesn't tell how to use it properly instead.I don't understand what other reviewers with positive feedbacks talk about. The don't seem to refer to the right book. There is something fishy going on."
2,applying elliott wave theory profitably,"I was expecting more from this book. The author has enormous knowledge of the markets but he certainly did not impart any in this book which is suitable only for beginners and intemediate traders. There is a great book waiting to be written , this isn't it."
5,Applying Elliot Wave Theory Pofitably,"Finally, a book on Elliot Wave that is easy to read and understand.Poser does a geat job of showing how to use Elliot Wave without trying to make it sound like you need to join a cult to do it.The book gives multiple trading examples (stocks,currencies,futures)and shows you how Elliot relates to other technical factors as well as market sentiment and even the fundementals.The book highlights some of the differances between short-term and position trading an there is a chapter on his take on how to use Elliot in more cyclial markets,such as bonds and currecies.Of course,there is the obligatory market forecast chapter as well.He not only provides a forecast of the U.S.stock market,but also for the Japanese Nikkei-225 and the dollar."
3,Good Overall Hypothesis,"This book was good in combination with some other books I was reading - Happiest Baby on the Block and The Baby Sleep Solution by Lisa Abidin, Suzy Giordano. Happiest Baby taught me the basics of colic and how to soothe the baby. Your Fussy Baby gave a more indepth analysis of colic but most importantly made me realize one thing - lack of sleep and colic go hand in hand. Once I realize that, I started sleep training. The Baby Sleep Solution worked wonders for us. I would not of thought to do this when I did if I had not read Your Fussy Baby.Pros- Was informativeCons- But not that informative"
1,Utterly Useless,"If you have a colicky baby, don't waste your time or money on this book. I only gave one star because the book might be helpful for the 80% of people with ""common fussy"" babies. For the 20% of us with the real fussy babies, I agree with the reviewer who says it would be better to spend the time sleeping than reading this useless book!"
3,"I liked ""Healthy Sleep Habits"" better","Since I already bought Dr. Weissbluth's other book ""Healthy Sleep Habits"", I didn't actually need to buy this book too. Most of the topics covered in this book is already in his other book and in my opinion, ""Healthy Sleep Habits"" had MORE information, like Q&As about sleep problems."
4,Art imitating life,"Thing I liked the most about this movie is that it shows the bad guy does not always get it in the end.The character of Kat is completely amoral and a user.When she didn't get her way,she became petty and vindictive.This is a great indie movie to watch simply because it goes against the traditional Hollywood ending where the good people win and the bad ones get their comeuppance."
4,Oracle and Black Canary together,"In this book, the girlfriend of the late Green Arrow, Black Canary, gets into and out of all sorts of adventures with the help of Oracle, the crippled, one-time Batgirl. It features the first issue of the comic Birds of Prey, as well as issues that include Lois Lane, Catwoman, Huntress, and Lady Shiva. The interaction between Black Canary, devil-may-care adventuress, and Oracle, the responsible Comissioner's daughter, is amusing. It's a good book full of fun. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys women in action."
3,Decent tale of a team coming together!!,"The beginnings of the Birds of Prey was a slightly meek one but its good to go back and see how it all started. The trade, written mostly by Chuck Dixon, was decent but seemed to serve more as a Black Canary story than anything else. While Oracle was present in each story she was never shown as indispensible. Huntress shows up in the last half of the book and is very clichéd. The women overall make a good team but the dialogue made them seem pathetic at times instead of empowered. The art was all over the place as you might expect from so many different pencillers. Overall, this is a decent collection that is a nice look back but not a necessary one."
2,Looked nice but...,"Looks pretty in the picture and when received, but it is stiff and was not possible to position it so it didn't look twisted when being worn. Maybe I received something defective? I returned it."
5,Excellent American folk tales,"This is quite possibly one of the best collections of American folk tales compiled anywhere. The vehicle for all the tales is that of storyteller telling the ""little lady"" tales of a group of animals who live in the Deep Woods. The tales follow a chronological sequence and relate the significant events in the lives of these highly anthropomorphic North American animals.The writing is charming and engaging, and the tales will delight readers of all ages.My copy was printed in the 1930's, and is in amongst the first few printings, though not in the very first batch. The tales strongly reflect the times and give an interesting glimpse into the now lost storytelling traditions of the US.The illustrations are excellent as well."
3,"Beautiful, but Conservative","The bible's appearance is beatiful and traditional. The text is KJV with changes only in words which have changed meaning since 1611. Unfortunately the marginal notes are conservative to the point of being nearly insane. I can only hope that if Scofield were alive today, and had the benefit of modern scholarship and technology, he would understand how rediculous and unreasonalbe some of his opinions were."
4,Solid but sure not perfect...,"This game actually has fair graphics and gives some decent 3-d endings but it really is short on characters. Scorpion, Jax, Sonya and Sub-Z return but that is basically it.The style of fighting is similar to UMK3 except that you can use weapons(somewhat)and move horizontally in the environment, which makes projectiles a bit less useful. The uber-boss, Shinnok, is actually a playable character and is far too easy to beat while the sub-boss, Goro, is next to impossible to defeat except with 1 or 2 specific fighters.Overall, I think this was one of the best MK games simply because it carries in the tradition of the glory days(MK 3).Note* This game did not work for me on Windows XP so beware, I also doubt that it will even run on Windows 2000. Unless you have a pre-historic operating system, you might do best to pick this game up on a console aka PS2."
3,"Classic in its own way, but not a must-own.","This album is more interesting from a cultural perspective than a musical perspective. The vocal performances are lackluster, and ""African Drum Suite Pt. 2"" is the only track I find myself wanting to revisit."
5,Great product!!,"I purchased this camelbak for a motorcycle trip I took out to yellowstone, It worked great, kept water cool and cold. I strapped it to the back of my backrest on my motorcycle and would grab a drink when i stopped for a picture or to grab a snack, worked excellent, the bladder DOES come out of the pack if need be for cleaning or whatever, but I have left mine in. it comes with 4 D-rings attached and molle straps on the back so you can attach it to pretty much anything and the quick disconnect bite valve with shut off is a great feature as well... all in all I rate this baby a total 5 star, and would buy another in a heartbeat :)"
5,husband loves it,My husband asked me to get this for him while he was deployed. He was glad to get it and it was exactly what he was expecting. Nice size. Not too big and not too small. He has never had a problem with camelbak products.
2,Blackhawk might be a better bet,Pros: great small size and a quality name you can trust. And a bite valve that has a cover to block out dirt when hiking. It has d rings if u need them and more of the tube has insulation on it than other brands. Cons: when compared to equivalent blackhawk products you realize some deficits. It sits fairly flat but spreads out a lot on a Molle vest. The fact the bladder doesn't pull out means it is harder to dry (especially if it is attached to a vest). And u cant add an insulated pouch. The Molle strips don't even compare to blackhawk speed strips.My suggestion. Don't get it if you have it attached to a Molle vest. Otherwise it is fine for throwing in a backpack or on a belt. Dont forget to get a drying hanger.
5,Funniest Movie I have seen in some time,"Meet the Spartans was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. This movie is a spoof of many of the movies I have seen as well as a spoof on celebrities. There appears to be nothing that was sacred enoough to not be spoofed. You have to watch it a couple times to get all the parodies.Well worth the purchase in laugh value, but might be a bit risque for family viewing."
1,DO NOT VIEW,This film is a waste of:your time.your money.your dignity.Avoid at all costs. I did not laugh once. I was angry after watching this movie.
1,meet the spartans,a waste of money... retarded movie... wait for free cable or better yet bypass then also
2,Questionable Video Quality for a Modern Movie on Blu-Ray,"Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who do this.The 1.85:1 video quality was very detailed, but had a fine grain, and I don't understand how such a recent movie could have grain (I thought they filmed all new movies digitally). There was so much detail, the skin of the people, and there was a lot of skin in this movie, looked gross with all of the imperfections. I only give the video quality of this movie an 8.2 on a 10.0 scale.The DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio was adequate; nothing special.The movie only lasted about an hour and 10 minutes. The credits started at a hour and 8 minutes. When I watched this on satellite a year of two ago, I thoroughly enjoyed it. This time I found it boring, and don't even remember seeing half of the look-a-like characters that were in the credits. Maybe I was just tired when I saw it this time."
4,Its just for laughs,"This movie really is hilarious--I definitely laughed out loud. I loved the guy who played Leonidas--he acted so seriously, like the Leonidas in 300, which made him even funnier. The key here is that you HAVE TO HAVE SEEN 300 to get all the jokes. All those folks who bashed this movie obviously didn't see 300, or Stomp the Yard for that matter (funniest scene)."
4,Not bad!,"I'm going to have to agree with most of the previous reviewers in saying that this is indeed not the best of films compared to other spoofs out there, though by no means is it a flop.Meet the Spartans follows in the footsteps of Epic Movie, Date Movie, Shriek if You Know What I Did Last Friday the 13th, and the Scary Movie series, in being a parody of several films including Shrek, Borat, and the Transformers among others as well shows like American Idol though as the title implies it does focus on the 300.It is a humorous movie with a good casting, even though some of the dialogues could have been better.The girls are also a great addition; Carmen Electra was HOT as Queen Gorgo and the Hooters girls were NICE as well.Overall, far from being a masterpiece, Meet the Spartans will provide for an evening's entertainment especially if one is in a really silly mood and/or intoxicated. 3.5 Stars"
1,One of the Worst Movies Ever Made,"Words fail me. How to describe this travesty of a movie? The best that can be said about it is that it actually may not be the worst movie ever made. It's close, I'm sure. Truly deserving of no stars. I guess on the bright side, at least it's not ""The Comebacks."""
1,Just Stupid.,Please do yourself a favor and dont get this movie. one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life save your money.
2,"Sometimes funny, often stupid","This movie is supposed to be a farce, and sometimes it is actually pretty funny. However, too often, it is too over the top to be funny. Rather than being subtle or witty, it hits you over the head with its jokes until they get annoying. For example, the first time the soldiers use a ""blue screen"" army, it's kind of funny. When that same trick is used several times, it's kind of boring. Too bad - it actually had a surprising amount of potential to be a truly funny farce."
3,Exactly what you're expecting.,"Well, it's no ""Airplane!"" but it's worth a few laughs. Thank goodness I didn't go see it in the theater and I can't even imagine who would purchase it, but it's not bad for a rental. On a slow day. When there's nothing else to watch.If you decide you just can't get through it (it does really break down in coherency towards the end, which is quite an achievement), just skip to the end credits and watch the song-and-dance number, which may be the best part of the movie."
4,It's interesting movie!!!,This movie was fun and interesting. This movie characters are funny and acts are good. The movie CGI was nice. The blu-ray disc was good.
4,An Army of 3 Strong,"This is obviously a take on Frank Millers movie 300.Well it has some great moments, but falls off a little here and there where there aren't any laughs.Still enjoyable though."
1,Very few funny scenes. Completely nonsense.,"There are very few funny scenes. It's completely nonsense. For example, there are scenes with American Idol's judges commenting the Spartans. After 30 minutes, the jokes dried up. Then, it's become very boring.It's still better than Scary movie 3 and Date movie."
2,THIS is UN-rated?????????,"The cover proclaims ""Meet the Spartans. Unrated Pit-of-death edition."" Why then is there so much censored material? I feel ripped off."
1,Bad from the start,"Having a penguin sexually attack a human isn't the best way to start, especially when you see its ""balls"" and do whatever it was that came out of its rear end. Too many male genitalia jokes and too much gay humor. I love Carmen Electra, but even she, with all her beauty can't save this film."
3,"Well, its a rental at best.","I enjoyed it, nice jokes and at least this one has some sort of a plot. Try watching ""Disaster Movie"", awful. What I don't like in these spoof movies is overuse of camoe appearance jokes like Paris Hilton, Brangelina and alike. They are not related to the story and they're not silly, just stupid.I think spoof movie is a dying art. I remember Airplane, Top Secret, Robin Hood, they were so funny without being insulting and below the belt.Overall, I don't think this movie is a keeper. Even if you are a fan of spoof movies you should rent it first."
3,Pit of Death?,"I'll have to admit, watching this movie the first time, there were some quick laughs, and it caught my attention. Sometimes, I feel the jokes were drawn out way too long, and that's a shame. If I were a 14 or 15 year old, I'd probably give this all 5 stars. This definitely isn't a movie in which you can watch over and over again. When you're bored, or strung out from the job, or the weekly grind is just too much and you want to let loose for a brief moment, go ahead. Otherwise, this movie is dime a dozen, in the ranks of The Comebacks, Epic Movie, etc etc etc."
3,Jokes were hit and miss,"MTS started out great. Some of the jokes had me literally LOL, which rarely happens with movies anymore. At other times, the jokes lingered far too long. The pit of death (american idol), top model, and deal or no deal sequences seem out of place (even for a parody) and last far too long. In fact, any of the modern-day inclusions only hurt the movie. The movie was strongest when the jokes were centered around 300. I cracked up when Leonidas was sparring with his son. I guess my biggest complaint was the ongoing gay joke. That might have worked 20 years ago. It's not a complaint from a tolerance perspective, it's just that we've seen it done before... too many times. I also didn't care for the wife (the actress or the character which was nothing like the one in 300)."
1,What a piece of crap!!!!,"In my 40 something years on this earth, and being a big fan and viewer of hundreds of comedies over the years, I honestly have to say this movie really, really sucks the big one!!! I did not even once come close to grinning at any point of this waste of film. I could not believe the level of crappiness this movie sunk to. The makers of this film, the actors, and whomever played a part in this movies production should be embarassed of themselves. Not even the slightest bit creative or funny in any way! I am just sorry I wasted time watching this piece of crap!"
1,NOT FUNNY AT ALL,"When did ""spoof"" movies quit being funny?Even at a short 84 minutes, this lame excuse for a movie went on WAY longer than needed.If only the viewer would get at least 1 or 2 good laughs while watching this thing.But it isn't to be.Stay away from this one.Don't even rent it.I'm sorry I wasted the time to watch it.Save yourselves! Run for your lives!"
1,Meet the Spartans (Unrated 'Pit of Death' Edition),"What a great way to get rid of an un-wanted house guest. Keep a copy of this film close at hand, and when you have had just about all you can take, put this film into your dvd player and hit the play button.If they haven't high-tailed it out your door within 15 minutes, pray for a visit from Freddy."
1,No people! NO!,You may think the 1 star rating is for the movie. No! The movie gets no stars. The 1 star is for the people who gave it 5 stars.
2,oh no,"i love stupid movies.but this this piece of garbage...just sucks.pop culture refrences are not,i repeat,not jokes.sure i liked date movie.heck,i even laughed a few times at epic movie.but i dont think i laughed once at meet the spatans.WARNING!THIS MOVIE IS EXTREMELY DUMB!AND ONLY FOR THE IMMATURE!"
2,"Boring, nothing new...","Nothing good to see in this movie, I know it is supoused to be stupid but is too much... a waste of time!"
5,Meet the Spartans (Rated),This was a very funny movie. i loved this movie and can't hardly wait til it comes out on DVD! I will have to see the unrated version really soon to.I loved scary movie (all of them) so i have the rated ones & unrated ones to! still working on to get epic movie and date movie unrated also!
1,Theyn Do One Thing Well,"Apparently this is the same team that's brought such jewels as Epic Movie, and Date Movie. They do one thing very well...They make damn good trailers. Unfortunately every thing worth seeing is in the trailers, and the rest is basically unbearable.I'll give them the one star, but just for about the first 5 minutes. There was a few chuckles around the pit scene, but that's pretty much the highlight of the movie. It's a damn shame too, because they had enough of a set up to do a decent spoof of 300. Instead they turned to humor that appears to be written by kids 14 and under.....Not much there. If they want to spoof other movies then they really should watch the Scary Movie series several times to see how it's really done when it's done right."
5,Absolutely the Best Spoof movie I have ever seen!,Obviously some of these reviewers have no sense of hummer!I have watched this movie five times or more and each time I am in pain from convulsing laughter!People - get a sense of hummer! This movie is GRATE!Can wait for the sequel or pre prequel or whatever!
1,What is this piece of garbage or tell me what you really think,"Wow! This was one bad movie. Horrible. It's even difficult to put into words how bad this film was. It is supposed to be a comedy but it sure isn't funny. It's not intelligent humor, or bathroom humor or slapstick humor or satire or...whatever kind of humor is left. It's not even silly. It's just some kind of rambling exercise in how not to make a movie. Even a take off on another movie or movies has to have some level of coherence. Look at Monty Python and the Holy Grail. That was totally silly, but it at least had some kind of plot to carry along it's nonsensical way. 'MEET THE SPARTANS' does not even insult the viewer's intelligence. It just assumes the watcher has no intelligence. And, oh my god, Kevin Sorbo. Somebody must have something on him to get him to be in this mess. No way would he do it for the role or the money. Anyway, skip this piece of junk. This may be the worst movie ever made. EVER!"
2,Barely Ok...,"I really enjoy a variety of comedies..sillier the better. I particularly enjoy spoofs but to be honest this was just stupid lol. Its not something I would watch more than once and I am glad it only cost $6.00, or else I would be abit ticked."
2,Kevin Sorbo saves the day,"Meet The Spartans is a plesant enough diversion but is by no means a classic.The saving grace was Kevin Sorbo,The man needs to do more comedy.He is a natural and could easily pull off 1940's style slap stick comedy."
1,Don't bother....,"I am usually quite understanding of the ""stupid movie"" concept and have enjoyed many of them. Many of the Sandler movies fit this concept. And I have also watched several of these parody movies as well. However, I have never been as bored watching one as I was with this one. If it weren't for Carmen, I'd been totally bored. I really can't believe that Sorbo was in this one.It does have some ""entertaining"" moments, but they are far and few between.If you just don't have anything on TV, or TIVO, then RENT it. But do not have any high expectations of this movie. In fact, just don't have ANY expectations of it, and I am sure you'll be fine."
3,Fun Movie,"I definitely enjoyed this movie and laughed uproariously during the first half. The second half was good, too, but some parts got a _little_ slow and didn't flow as well between spoofs... The whole movie is a bit short, though, for the price."
1,Awful!!!,Do you know the saying less is more? I am so glad Kevin Sorbo was in this movie or I would have totally wasted my money renting it. I found the endless gay references were getting tiresome and just weren't amusing at all. I am usually not bothered and sometimes amused by crude humor but this was on a level where I just kept finding myself completely grossed out. Perhaps I'm am getting more delicate with age but this is just ridiculous! It seems as if people are not given credit for the ability to find subtle humor amusing. Usually Lampoon movies are more silly and have more slapstick but this was more along the lines of yucky and stupid.
5,This book is an example of how all ship history books should,Franklin has written a fully detailed history of these ships and has collected many photos never published before. I hope he will write other ship histories with same care. Quality of print is excellent.
3,Nice but not necessary,"Very nice high quality plasticized map but really not necessary unless you plan to spread your map out in the rain somewhere to try to read it. Free maps that are entirely adequate are available at the airport when you land. You'll probably be given more than one. The Rough Guides map had hiking trails marked on it which was one of the things that attracted me. It turns out that only some of the trails are on the map. There are many more trails in real life than show on the Rough Guides map and, in real life, on the island, the Spanish government has marked the trails well enough that I didn't find the Rough Guides map to be necessary at all."
1,I was disappointed in this book,"I've been reading herbalist books for over 30 years, and this book just didn't ring true to me. It reads like an infomercial, and serious herbal medicine books tell you the good with the bad. I've already given it away to Goodwill, as there's no place for it in my library. I'd like to be able to recommend a more suitable herbalist book, the ones I have are all out-of-print, so I'm still looking for a recent book with new, truthful information in it."
1,"Beware, You can get pink or white, at the sellers discretion.","Beware - I wanted, needed and ordered what I thought were going to be ""Pink"" wristbands, but half my order was ""White"". I reviewed my order confirmation which said ""Pink."" I contacted the seller and they told me too bad they ship what ever they have in stock to keep their prices down. You get what they send, no returns. This product should state set of 2, Pink ribbon embroidered Cloth wristbands, Pink and/or White."
1,Disappointed,"We ordered these arm bands for my son who wanted pink. He received white. As listing notes that he will receive a mixed assortment, we assumed at least one would be pink. Contacted the seller who insisted that the listing was accurate with what we received. Buyer beware of this seller."
3,decent,"it's a good cd, but more rock-abilily than swing. Setzer is a great artist, but goes over the top and it's kind of hard to keep up with when dancing. It gets tiring to listen to after a few songs because they sound similair, but good to just sporadically pop in. Overall I like it-especially Hollywood Nocturne."
3,Look for the real thing when you're buyin' swing,"I love the Stray Cats, and I love swing, but these two together are less than the sum of the parts. Setzer doesn't have the nuance to let this music develop; he starts too far in to the songs, and the tone of his band, and particularly his guitar, is a bit too bright. Exceptions are Prima's Jump, Jive, An' Wail (which does all three) and Rock This Town (the Stray Cats standby)."
3,Brian Setzer's Big Band,"I bought this for Rock This Town. None of the other tunes are up to par with it. But the band sounds great, and Rock This Town is so good it was worth buying the CD"
5,C'mon! let's Jive!,"YEs, indeed!!! a very good CD to catch ! Especially when u feel moody!! because this Cd contain song that is so Up tempo such as Jump Jive & wail."
5,"Thanks Brian, You Groove","I want to say thank-you Brian Setzer for making music that doesn't live on the dark side of life. It is now time for a new style of music to emerge and take hold, and Brian, you da man! I have to play this album at least 2 times every day. Your voice is better than ever and your guitar is still legendary. Go Kat Go! To everyone else who is reading this... BUY THIS CD NOW."
5,Setser Does It Again,This CD is definitely BSO's best to date. Saw them in concert recently and they were the greatest. This CD captures a lot of the energy they generate in concert. Setser got two standing O's at the show. He is on a roll!
5,Classic fun swing,"This includes the song from the Gap commercial! It's a classic! If your a cool rockabilly/swing retro chick like me, than be ultra cool and buy this classic cd!!! Also Gwen stefani sings an aWESOME duet with setzer, BABY YOUR THE BOSS. GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT AWESOME COOL WONNDERFUL A lindy hoppin, jitterbuggin, martini sippin', cigar smokin' CLASSIC!!! Even a swing version of Rosemary Clooney's CLASSIC hit This Ole House, why can't you record another classic like thsi Setzer(instrad of the horrible Vavoom disaster)."
4,Setzer's Guitar swings and you can't sit still!,"I happened to catch the group live in 1997 in Finland and they blew me away. This album has the edge over its predecessors in that Setzer's guitar is more up front making it somewhat more rockin' than the earlier efforts. The Stray Cats remakes and You're the Boss (and maybe Hollywood Noctune) don't quite work but the rest is dynamite. You gotta jump, jive and then you wail!"
1,the REAL swing daddies?,"if you like REAL swing music, check out glen miller, count basie and the like. sorry to all you five star folks, but setzer don't swing it. if you like REAL guitar music-jimi hendrix and eric clapton are just the icing on the cake. why doesn't somebody do a brand-spanking new recording of old hits such as- 'in the mood,' 'sing sing sing'-you know, the chips ahoy song? that ROCKS to swing to-east coast and the jitterbug come easily. check out the REAL swing arists-these aren't the real things."
2,Not so good,"Why all the good reviews on this CD? Are you all brain dead? The production on this CD is poor. It says the Brian Setzer Orchestra, but about all that can be heard is his guitar and voice. Why even have an orchestra? I listened to this CD several times then traded it at a swap place for a Zoot Sims. Very nice CD which I have listened to a zillion times. There is a god."
4,A Great Release,"I will not forget the date i bought this 1-August 8th, 1998. I have loved this record ever since. It is a feel-good album with a great band leader(Stezer). Pick this 1 up."
5,"for music you can have fun with, crank this one way up","This cd just kicks. When you need a little pick me up, turning this one way up gives you something to dance around the house with."
5,Setzer is the King of Retro Swing,"I have bought each of Brian Setzers three swing albums the very week they were released. It is outstanding at everything he does. Among the best guitarists in any genre today. Another great guitarist, singer and song writer -- and MUST HAVE jump blues/swing is Buddy Blue --."
5,"Toe-tapping, catch-yourself-dacing, smile-inducing fun!","I bought this less than 3 weeks ago, and used it in my alarm clock - let's just say I'm a little less inclined to hit the snooze bar!I've already given one copy as a gift and recommended it to at least a dozen people. The hard part is getting it out of the cd player.The music is so rocking, swinging, fun you will find yourself dancing in you living room. When you spouse sees you they wont laugh -- they'll jump in.This music will appeal to everyone."
4,"It's good, but they've done better","This is a solid CD, but I think that Setzer was just aiming to please the newfound swingers. His older albums are much more jazz oriented, and are also better. I really like that he delved into different styles (sort of) on this CD. The remake of Bobby Darin's ""As long as I'm singin'"" is absolutely fantastic. The amount of energy that the BSO puts into their music is also a major plus; every song has a great feeling of intensity behind it (except the awful remake of ""Sleepwalk"" and the hideous ""Hollywood Nocturne""). Worth the money, definitely."
3,"Imperfect, but good enough for all that","You can hardly blame Setzer for the fact that everyone bought this album for ""Jump, Jive and Wail"" and then complained when the song got overplayed. All that aside, this record could have been better than it ended up being. I think most of the cover songs here have a bit too much verve. The redux version of ""Rock This Town"" is especially overblown, to the point of being annoying. However, the band's original work, such as ""Hollywood Nocturne"", and ""Switchblade 327"", are generally good, and worth the price of admission. Hopefully the group will settle down when they record again and not be so dependent on licking up old songs."
3,Not so good.,"I was a little dissapointed by this one. They don't seem to have the spark or the rich sound of a 1950's swing band. The guitar was overstated on almost all the tracks, and the Louis Prima cover of ""Jump Jive an' Wail"" did not hold a candle to the original. Too bad people everywhere who don't know any better are thinking, oh, ""Jump Jive an' Wail"" was by the Brian Setzer Orchestra. . ."
3,"Come on, this hardly rocks at all","This was a real disappointment after Guitar Slinger.If you liked that as much as I did and are looking for more of the same, don't look here.If you're a ""swinger"" and liked the music in the movie of the same name you might like this more than I did.I saw Brian and the band perform at the Minnesota Zoo Ampitheatre on 7/3 and they really rocked. I bought this CD the next day and the tunes he played from this CD come across much better live."
3,It's ok,"I kind of like this album. It was a gift. It is very good for backgroud music. There are at least two good songs on the album. But if your looking for very good quality swing music, don't look here."
2,over done,"I think this album is over-rated. Brian Setzer these days is far too flashy. I much preferred him when he was with the Stray Cats. If your looking for good swing try Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, or Alien Fashion Show."
4,Another good swing album,"Brian Setzer, the former Stray Cat, is in his own band when this CD was made. He sings a 50s song ""Jump Jive An Wail"" and wrote his own song ""Dirty Boogie"" and both are two great swinging songs. Those two are the best songs on this album. If you like the Stray Cats and Brian Setzer this is your album."
2,Nice try Spayed Cat.,"I bought it, I listened, and put it on the bottom of the CD rack. I prefer the Louis Prima version of Jump, Jive, and Wail (found on Ultra Lounge). Brian's efforts and intensions are good, but his overuse of his six strings is overbearing. It sounds like there is a decent band behind him, and you hear it occasionally, but way too little. His rockabilly sound is good, for rockabilly, but it doesn't fall in my definition of swing. Try Voo Doo Daddies and Royal Crown Revue for something closer."
3,Swingin' Stray Cat.,"If the Benny Goodman band and Billy Haley band has gotten together, they probably would have sounded something like this and I don't know if that's a good thing or not. Some of these selections are too frantic. Entertaining are 'This Old House' and the only instrumental 'Sleep Walk'. Brian even goes back to his Stray Cat roots with 'Rock This Town'. Altogether not a bad album but could have been better."
5,Excellent up tempo music to workout with.,"I put this in my CD, jumped on my Nordic Track and burned off 1000 calories just trying to keep up to the beat! It is one of the best CD's I have bought in the past couple of years, and I buy alot. This CD makes me feel good!"
3,not as good as second alblum,While the arrangements were very good the overall quality of the lyrics were not as good as the second alblum by the Brian Setzer orchestra. Also one other suggestion for Mr. setzer whos work i have ALWAYS LIKED STICK TO THE FAST STUFF YOU ARE NO BALLAD SINGER HE COMES OFF SOUNDING LIKE A BAD FRANK SINATRA STICK TO THE UP TEMPO SONGS.
2,Musical sandpaper,"What word best suits this album? I can't decide between abrasive, monotonous, shallow, tiring, and regretful -- the last word regarding my remorse over the money I wasted on it. Once you've heard one song, you've heard them all."
1,How is this enjoyable?,"Brian is a great guitarist, but he has always been and always will be a guitar hero wannabe. His butchering of the classic ""Sleepwalk"" is unforgivable. If I hear Jump, Jive and Wail again I am going to drink battery acid to distract my senses from the pain inflicted in my ears."
1,trendy trendy trendy,"It was a sad day when I turned on the TV and saw Brian Setzer playing on Beverly Hills 90210. The whole supposed swing revival is heading straight to the Stray Cat graveyard. This album has obvious covers, although great guitar playing, can't Setzer remain pure? Junior Highers and their parents now are into ""swing"". It's over for another decad or so......"
1,Give me a break!,"Why bother with this album? Brian Setzer is neither an inventor nor an interpreter of Swing. Just a hungry musician looking for a hook. There is so much original Swing and Big Band music available that I wonder why anyone would need a 90's re-hash.It seems like just another cynical marketing ploy by a bunch of record producers. They're always trying to repackage music from another era or country and promote it as the next ""new"" fad.I suppose they made some money off it, but this fad crashed faster than the Hindenburg.I suppose that this album might appeal to twenty-somethings who have little knowledge of real Swing and want to look trendy.What's next Brian? How about remaking Red Army Drinking songs and promoting them as the next craze? Na Zdarovia Komrade!D.Olney"
1,You have got to be kidding...,"but if you're reading this, it's probably too late. Crashingly dull renderings of obvious 40's and 50's pseudo swing and rockabilly records, except ""This Ole House"" which is a crashingly dull rendering of a '50s pseudo country song. About the best thing you can say for this mangled pile of kitschy pap is..well I guess there ain't no best thing after all. Do yourself a favor and take the money you saved for this and buy a Red Prysock or Bullmoose Jackson CD. It's what Brian listens to."
1,Basically unlistenable,"This is one of the worst albums I've ever bought. I think people should buy this if they have obnoxious teenagers who like to play loud music. Ten minutes of this and EVERYONE will leave the house! They cannot play anything slow or mellow, just absolute amps-cranked-up-to-10. Someone should set this guy down and play a little swing and rockabilly to him!"
5,Let's Swing,Great . It gets your feet moving and is great to hear updated versions of these songs. It would be ashame for these great songs to just go with the generation that first swang to them.
4,Stray Cats edge mixed with the talented BSOrchestra,"This album follows the same pattern of the earlier two albums; but has more edge to it. BSO covers the popular Louis Prima song, ""Jump, Jive and Wail"" used in the Gap commercial. There is a perky rendition of ""Rock This Town"" and some other popular tunes which are used in concert, including ""This Old House"" and ""As Long As I'm singing"" (usually used to close down the joint). Brian's has written a good number of the songs with a nice mixin of older standards. You'll want to add this one to your BSO collection!"
3,Worth a Listen - A Few Good Tracks,"This is a pretty good CD. If you like the classic rockabilly style of music you will like this one. I found it was not as good as Guitar Slinger, but it does have a great swing version of Jump, Jive, An' Wail and a rockin version of Rock This Town, which are both GREAT tracks."
3,"Great arrangements, curious engineering","I bought The Dirty Boogie and Guitar Slinger (BS's second swing release) the same day. While both have great music, I much preferred the choices made by the recording engineer on Guitar Slinger. On ""Boogie"" Brian's vocals all seemed to be a mono mix, with an annoying amount of mono slap-back echo. Ditto for his guitar: a mono mix about 15 degrees off-center. Conversely, Guitar Slinger made good use of stereo vocals (or at least stereo verb and echo) and the guitar seems much more expansive across the soundstage. I don't know who to thank or blame--the writing's too small for my old eyes. Anyway, I kept Guitar Slinger, and traded ""Boogie"" for Big Bad VooDoo Daddy."
4,Good Songs!,"This was a good c-d! I liked all the songs, espically Jump Jive and Wail, You're The Boss, and This Cat's On A Hot Tin Roof. The only thing wrong with this c-d is that the recording sounds really bad. It's kinda hard to hear and sounds a little bit ruffled. Even on my dad's really good sterio."
4,Great ragtime and novelty tunes.,"I was very impressed with Dave Tucker and his first cd. The selections were interesting, and the playing was ""top notch."" I did lose interest towards the end with the traditional jazz pieces, but overall the recording was strong.Ragtime is alive and well. I am looking forward to the ""new release in 03."""
1,"Should be titled ""The Unofficial Guide to Personal Finance""","This book should have been titled ""The Unofficial Guide to Personal Finance"". Only Part IV, chapters 10 through 13, about 160 pages are devoted to online investing, and it's at a very elementary level. The rest of the book deals with bank accounts, credit cards, debt reduction, insurance, taxes, and other personal finance issues. If you want to learn about Online Investing, leave this book on the shelf and look for another book which has doesn't have all this non-Online Investing stuff. Leave this POS on the shelf."
4,Good Saw - Be careful on angles,"I have used this product extensively and find it excellent for short cuts. For wider boards, however, I find there is enough black-slack to product off-angle cuts which become a problem for precise molding or table-top work."
4,best saw for the price,"I already have a miter saw but I was looking for a larger one. This saw fits the bill. It worked perfect right out of the box. You can not beat the price. It did not have a laser but I found I could line my work up by eye, who new. I would recomend this saw to anyone."
5,Excellent tool - Excellent Value,"I just purchased this saw a couple weeks ago. I have just completed installing new trim in one of the bathrooms and it looks great. This saw is big enough to do large trim boards with ease. I have not done much in the way of complex cuts (bevel & miter), but on the returns that I have cut, it makes a nice clean cut every time."
1,Dead or Dead!,"Don't have much to say, bad game play and no easy setting. Slow online play and small amount of people to play as."
4,good fun,"I liked the game a lot. It seems like I had more fun with Dead or Alive Ultimate, though. However, if you are a fan of the franchise you need to get it."
2,Not the best...,"Good-Graphical upgrade/stages/nice CG movies/Online mode/thats about itBad-Not enough extra content/unlockable costumes are mostly just color variated/Online Mode frequently lags/Cheap AI starting at stage 1/NO easy mode/game gets boring after awhileThis was the only fighting game for the 360 when I bought it and to this day I still regret buying this. The AI will counter everything and juggle you for days, at STAGE 1!...when you stack up all the negatives along with the AI this game isnt very fun. After I unlocked everything I bought Virtua fighter 5 and this became obsolete."
1,ridiculous,"Don't wast your money on this game. Get Dead or Alive 3. This game doesn't have an easy mode and normal might as well be extra hard. You'll get spun around, knocked down, and KO'ed by the first opponent before you even have a chance to attempt a combo. It will make you pull your hair out and want to chuck the controller into the TV. And it never get's better. You can't excel at this game. You can practice moves in the sparing area as much as you want but when it comes to the real game, you'll never get a chance to use the moves you've practiced and in the rare instance that you can use the move, IT JUST WON'T WORK!!!! It's ridiculous that so many people have given this game a good review. It's awful. Don't buy it."
4,Well done.,"Overall an excellent game. Better graphics, faster paced, and a much more difficult boss than previous titles. The boss does get frustrating in story and time-attack mode. Nice Halo related bonuses/easter-egg."
2,to easy/to fast,"I liked this game at first but it gotten boaring, its to easy to short and the same as the other dead or alive games. The graphics is good but the rest is the same like the other DOA games, only two new characters in this game but thats it. The combos are good but it lowers the opponiets bar to quick cause the attacks is to powerful, like virtua fighter, tekken, street fighter, and this one. This game gets real boaring after awhile so this is an okay game."
1,Dead or Alive 4,"This is the worst fighting game I have ever played.The graphics are nice, the controls are simple. The frustration level is through the roof. At many points you may as well set the controller on the floor as you get locked into seeming endless combos by your opponents, unable to do anything. They will constantly grab you, constantly counter you, and there's not a thing you can do to stop it. If you are not a vetran of the pervious titles, do not attempt to play this game as there is no learning curve."
2,The Shrug,"There's nothing really wrong with this movie, but there's nothing really great about it either. It's just kinda there, like vanilla pudding.There are some decent jump scares throughout, but other than that it's pretty much your standard haunted house story. Except this one's set in Japan, a choice which I cannot understand at all. It made all those gaijins stick out like sore thumbs and I kept wondering what Ted Raimi was doing in Japan.The writing was sophomoric, the acting was uninspired and the direction felt like a Japanese director doing an American version of his original Japanese story. It ended being the cinematic equivalent of Yoshinoya Beef Bowl. Not Japanese or American enough to be any good, it takes the worst elements of both and combines them into a $2.99 Teriyaki Chicken Meal."
2,I have a grudge...,"You know? People were comparing this movie to ""The Ring,"" but other than having the origional done in Japan, there's no comparison.The main character (played by Sarah Michelle Gellar) is living in Japan and takes this job of house sitting with an elderly man.Of course the house has some history, the usual death and messed up people.The ghost of a woman comes back and haunts the living heck out of the characters in this movie.The only problem was it wasn't scary.There was this gutteral sound that the ghost woman made, which was a little eerie, but not enough to give someone nightmares...or the creeps at all.I gave it two stars because the Japanese come up with some wicked cool scary movies!But it's okay to miss this one.If you haven't seen it, go see ""The Ring"" or better yet, ""Ringu"""
3,The Grudge- pretty good time!,"I thought this movie was pretty good. I saw it at the theatre with a group of my friends and there were a lot of parts where the movie ""popped"" out at you and made the whole audience jump. I love that. It was a great movie to see if you get scared of your closet or noises in your house at night. I mostly found this movie funny, however, because I tend not to get scared of movies anymore. I did jump at the ""pop out"" scenes though."
3,It's not THAT bad,"Above and beyond all genres of film, horror takes the cake for me. So when I heard about ""The Grudge"", how it was yet another version of ""The Ring"" (which ""Ju-On also was), I was prepared to vomit, yes.This went beyond my expectations and had some genuinely frightening moments--no thanks to the lead performances of ""who again?"" Hollywood nonentities like Sarah Michelle Gellar or Bill Pullman. Not even frightening moments exactly, frightening sequences, like when Matthew's sister is essentially tortured psychologically till she's sucked under the bed by that blue chick who crawls like she's really angry and really handicapped.This is a scary movie to a considerable degree. Yeah, it's derivative, and yeah, they use the blue chick too much. But there are some scary moments, and like the other reviewer said, it beats crap like Seed of Chucky. Worth a rental."
2,Nothing to Get Scared About,"This movie is alright. It has it's moments, but really isn't that scary. I don't understand why the movie even had to take place in Japan and star someone like Sarah Michelle Gellar. Anyway, I'm glad I didn't pay $$$ to see this movie."
3,Not a horror film,"""The Grudge"" offers several minutes of high intensity and suspense, but never delivers the goods of a true horror film. That is why I wouldn't classify it as one. A lot of time is spent on the story arc developing, which is rare in a film like this. While the film's twist is not nearly as satisfying as the superior ""The Ring"", ""The Grudge"" offers some genuine spooks and scares for the audience. Sarah Michelle Gellar is good in a supporting performance, marketed as the lead."
4,the grudge its better on blu-ray than ever uncut,"good film to watch by yourself in the dark loved it i looks real and better i my 48 inch lcd tv hd picture like other horror blu-rays i got at amazon there good heres my list 5 stars sings, the thing, taxes chainsaw the original, 30 days of night, omen 1 omen 2 thanks 2pac"
3,asian culture,"Just to educate you Americans asian movies don't really follow the same format as american movies. With asian movies there's isn't much in terms of plot. Asian movies follow a situation from point A to B to C and so on. There isn't much of a strong plot just a movie that has character development, situations, and a backstory. That's it."
2,More Terrifying Than The Ring? Not.....,"Although I didn't find The Ring terrifying, this movie surely isn't terrifying at all. But I guess you can't expect much horror in a PG-13 rated movie. It has also been compared to the movie 28 Days Later which is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Sarah Michelle Gellar tries to give a shocking performance in this movie but fails terribly. She moves to Tokyo to continue her nursing career and learns about mysterious deaths and she tries to find the source of the deaths. All I can remember about this film is the stupid looking child who once he opens his mouth and you are witness to it, you die. We find out the child is a ghost who died a terrible death and now is seeking revenge. No blood, no gore, not scary and overall disappointing. I hope they don't plan to make The Grudge 2. If you are curious and have not seen this movie, please rent it first and don't waste the money to buy it!"
5,Very Scary!,"I thought that this film was scary. In looking at previous reviews, I have to wonder if they saw the film. It is not your typical American slasher film. As one reviewer noted, the innocent are the victims and you can not escape the grudge. I enjoyed it thoroughly. If you want a good ghost story this is for you."
4,scary,I thought this was a very scary movie for only being PG-13. There is not a lot of gore its just a very creepy movie all together. Sarah Michelle Gellar does an excellent job as well as Bill Pullman. The movie is well written and is executed to perfection.
1,New concept....What ?,This is the same old horror ghost story just in a different package. I explected nothing and got what i expected.
1,Theatrical and Directors Cut Release,Another example of money-bloodsucking ideas of studioslearn to wait!.... they eventually will learn to tell people their plans
1,Terrible,"I rented this movie on pay-per-view on a Friday night when I was really in the mood for something scary. Not only was it not scary, it was boring. And enough we the meowing kid! The kid and the cat were killed in the same tragic accident but I don't understand how they merged into one. Or why the kid was wearing eyeliner. Don't waste your money on this movie."
2,Yet another piece of....,"Title said it all, I guess they were trying to make the big bucks by having Sam Rami's name on it. Stupid title and also stupid movie."
3,"Not the best, not the worst.","Scary at times, but not enough to make it interesting. It was a borderline snooze flick for me."
1,horrible,"even if there were on option for 0 stars, i'd still have to consider giving this movie 1 star. only because sarah michelle gellar is in it. she's the only decent actor in the movie, which is never scary, never suspenseful, and completely lacks a plot. it re-creates the scare scenes of the original ""grudge"" only they're not scary this time, because we don't care anything about the characters going through it. a horrible waste of time, and this comes from someone who really appreciates horror films, even bad ones. this movie made ""the ring 2"" look like a really good, really scary movie. skip it. don't waste your time."
1,Sucks,"The simple fact that the leading character is Sarah Michelle Gellar should tell you enough. This movie is pure crap. There is not one part in this movie that is scary...I was laughing and fast forwarding the DVD most of the time because I was able to anticipate every seen and grew tired of it dragging along. Boy did this movie just suck. Don't listen to all the losers who think this is a good horror movie. Trust me, it blows."
4,Ohh my gosh!!!!,"Ok, the only reason I gave it only 4, and not 5 stars, was that it scared the pants off me. I had a hard time sleeping that night, after watching it. And to tell you the truth, I'm surprised I didn't have nightmares from it. I jumped for days after, just hearing a cat meow. My friend at work said that he took the nightlite out of his baby's room, and slept with it in his, after seeing that movie, and I don't blame him.That freaked me out.But overall, great movie, but I'd probably not see it again, just because it is so scary, even though I now know the movie."
4,good movie,"I really like that movie, its a really good movie that I could watch over and over again.... Its true!!!!"
1,"Shame on you, Takashi Shimizu! You wasted my horror-movie viewing!","WHY? WHY? WHY? How could you do this, Mr. Takashi Shimizu!? YOU SCARED MY MOM AND BROTHER WITH THIS RETARD MOVIE (but not me[HAHA!]), BANNING ALL OTHER HORRORS (CURSED, SLEEPY HOLLOW, etc.) TILL FREAKIN' OCTOBER! SAW was at least (never saw SAW[tee-hee!]) supposed to be better than this CRAPPIEST PIECE OF CRAP IN CRAPTOWN! Conclusion: I hate this piece of crap!"
1,OH MY GOD.....IT'S A MEOWING JAPANIESE KID!! RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!!,"This is the most saddest excuse of a horror movie I have ever seen. I mean come on do people really think that meowing kids, and Japanese women in every picture of one guy is really scary....I have seen Disney halloween movies scarier than this. poor special effects as well.....there is a part with some gost or zombie girl is crawling down the stairs of the house....it looks like somthing you would see in a 50's king kong or godzilla movie. I thought this movie would be better but the truth is the scariest parts were all put in the advirtisements on TV and those weren't even scary. If you want to see a scary movie watch George Romero's movies. like Night of the living dead or the recent movie Land of the Dead"
2,You will have a grudge against the producers,"This was pretty bad - I have to be more than a little irritated to take the time to write a review. First, the thing was in the model of a greek trajedy. It was just a series of bad things happening. It did not seem to matter if the characters were courageous or ingenious. It did not matter if they ran from the problems or faced them - there was no hope.Second - the flashbacks were badly done - it was never clear whether you were looking at past or present, and the plot was a hairball. Do yourself a favor and skip this one."
1,Another American blunder,If possible this movie is worse than the Ring 2. Buy the Japanese versions. They are so much better.
2,"That's The Grudge, huh?","This was not very good, in my opinion. The Ring scared the bejeezus outta me. This was not scary. Two weeks afterwards, I still find my mind wandering about one thing...why the heck didn't they just kick that little boy in the head and send him accross the room? If I walk into my house and see a half-naked boy meowing and hissing at me, I'm gonna flip him over my knee and give him a good spankin'"
3,I was expecting more,"Perhaps I was expecting more because I'm a huge Buffy fan and Sarah is a good actress overall.I thought this movie would be more of a supernatural theme; ghosts, evil spirits, hauntings and so on.But it was more of a drama based movie than a thiller.I do have to admit there was one scene that flashed so quickly it did startle me and the sound effects were not so bad. Quite chilling.Overall it was an okay movie. One that I'll take out in a year or so after I've watched all my other thillers and ghosty goulish movies."
2,Sound System Not Good for UMD Movies,"The Grudge is a 4 star (out of 5) movie, but for the PSP... the sound system must be higher quality. I bought this for 20 bucks at a store, because I was going on a trip soon. I tried the plane's, my own, and the PSP's headphones and none of them produced good sound quality. The games get good sound quality, while the movies are so much lower, that sometimes you can't hear what they're saying. It's so annoying. Get it on DVD, and you'll at least be more satisfied than this."
2,It just does not measure up,To the original Grudge that is. The first movie I thought was very scary and down right super freaky in some parts. This movie does have a few parts that are are scary . But I must stress the word (few) very brief and far in between . The movie is only about 90 minutes but it feels so much longer because of a slow story. I will also agree with some of the other reviews that say that this movie recycles too much of what was seen in the first movie. That about sums it up .
4,"Commendable movie, uncommendable ending","This movie was undoubtedly quite creepy, and had some positive fear-producing features that few or no other films possess. For example, the film had a neat scene where a man is watching a security camera tape in which an entity forms a few feet away from the camera and then advances until its eyes appear right in front of the screen. Another good part is when a jaw is found in a cellar and a man confronts the girl who has lost the jaw. The only negative factors in my opinion were that the acting was generally kind of lousy, and that the movie ended on such an undecided note (the creature's face being zoomed in on). Regardless, though, this movie is definitely to be classified as a thriller and I would recommend it highly."
3,The Grudge is scary!,"Although I admit there are points where this movie seems to be screaming, ""Look! This is like The Ring!"", all in all this movie is pretty good. There are some genuinely horrifying moments, and the effects are good enough to not take attention away from the plot. Although I cannot for the life of me imagine why a vengeful, all-powerful ghost would have to call her victims to ask their address..."
1,The Grudge 2....total junk!!!,"How can so many people rate this movie a high star?!?It overused the same ghostly scenes from the Grudge and it was extremly predictable. You already know how it will end when you watch the first twenty minutes of it.I mean, it showed the same house that was ""burned down"" in part one, and had the same effect as it: people visit the house, then they are cursed. Nothing can beat the original. nothing. You are wasting your time with this movie, seriously.If you did not think this was a bad movie then answer this one question: why was that man eating breakfast at the table killed, along with the others when they never visited the house AND (mind you) they were in CHICAGO, not JAPAN?!?!?!?! wow, do NOT rent this junk."
2,A stinker,"I didnt have very many high hopes for this movie and so I wasnt disappointed. With the rash of Japanese Remakes, this one just falls in line with all the others. It replaces the general skin creeping suspense and overall unease of the original with ""Gotcha!"" moments. There are no scenes of blood and guts in the original but Hollywood felt compelled to add them for the remake. WHY?? Blood and Guts do NOT make a horror movie!If you want a scary movie, Get the original Ju-On. They are ofcourse very similar but Ju-On will have you pulling the blanket over your eyes and pulling the covers far back before you go to sleep.From now on Ill be skipping the American remakes and just sticking with the original J-Horror movies, Dark Water, Eyes with out a face, A Tale of Two Sisters etc Hollywood will ruin them all sooner or later!"
2,Eh .... Well .... Okay,"The Grudge has maybe two or three good moments, but they are quick frights and hardly enough to sustain a full length feature. Reccommended for SMG fans and those afraid of close-ups of young Japanese children."
3,Kind of mad.,"I Watched this at my grandmas house, it wasn't very scary. No parts had me jumping out of my seat, the next day I rented ""ju on"" the Orginal Japan Film. It Was a lot better, it made a lot more sense. So if you want to see this movie, i recommend watching ""Ju on"" first."
3,not bad,"The Grudge is an interesting little horror film. It's very cool and cerebral and a little dull for long periods and then it wakes you up with a nasty scare. It's not great but it's hardly the worst movie either. Sarah Michelle Gellar is basically playing Buffy without powers and without the neurosis. She's saddled with a cute but dumb as dirt boyfriend who, like the boyfriend in The Ring turns out to be fairly useless. Since I brought up The Ring I have to say that my first feeling about the Grudge was that it was a Ring rip off. When the ghost comes crawling down the stairs it looks just like Samara Morgan coming out of the TV but after watching a few Japanese horror movies I've come to the conclusion that the ghosts in this particular genre tend be grotesquely misshapen things that creep and have messy hair.The Grudge was okay. I wouldn't buy it and I'm glad I didn't see it in the theaters but it has its moments."
5,scared the s*** out of me...,"The people who are giving this movie a bad review are just crazy. This was one of the BEST and most satisfying horror movies I have seen in a long time, if ever. I cannot remember a movie that has freaked me out more and left me afraid to get up at night to go to the bathroom. I knew that ""she"" and the little boy were just waiting for me. The sounds and visuals are fantastic and overly effective, so much so that it still stays with me even months after seeing the film. This was a great horror movie and one that, because of the scares, I will not have the nerve to even watch again anytime soon. Even the TV ads for it bother me. It's a must see, but only if you have someone to sleep in the same bed with you after seeing it."
3,this movie is stupid,"i'm 10 and i saw this and i thought it was actually really scary. it's only the fact that things always come out of nowhere and scare the heck out of you. after i'd seen it i realized its a stupid film with a stupid plot. i could never call it a good movie, but it was scary which distracts you from the terrible plot."
2,Not as good as expected,"The previews for this movie looked like it would be a good one, but I was very disappointed. It was slightly boring and just when you thought something unexpected would happen, not much did. Then you would think as least the ending would finally make up for the slack and it was also disappointing. So, I suggest save your money for a better film."
2,"Full of gotchas, but not much else","The violent circumstances of a Japanese family's death have given rise to a curse in which all who enter their old house are stalked and killed by demons representing the dead family. That's not much of a plot, which is why this isn't much of a movie. In scene after scene, we watch a hapless person bumble through an abandoned area, slowly coming to the realization that they are not alone. They all eventually succumb to the fear that envelopes them, and the demons manifest themselves in a variety of creepy ways before dispatching the bumblers. The production values are high, and the scenes are very creepy/scary/disturbing, which is saying something. But any attempt to inject reason or logic into viewing the movie bursts the bubble, and ultimately, there's just not enough to sustain a feature film."
1,I Wish I Could Give It A Zero Star!,"Is it me or were the previews for this movie better than the movie itself!I went and saw this movie last night for free, and I think I want my money back! This was an absolutely horrendous movie. TERRIBLE! I know it came out on DVD this week but I'm here to tell you DON'T SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS! It isn't anywhere near as good as the first one.1. Too many subplots. They somehow interwine in the end but nonsensically.2. This movie isn't scary at all! The scenes that were scary in the original are used again in this one, i.e., the Grudge coming from the a shadow in the ceiling, the ghost under the cover, and the little boy making the cat sound. All the same scenes, just a new movie.3. And finally there were quite a few unneccessary scenes and unneccessary charachters.This movie was terrible. Borrow someones or rent it before you buy."
2,Two thumbs down!,"I had watched Ju-On The Grudge, the original japanese version, and I was creeped out by it. It was excellent, I got really scared with the opening scenes of this movie... but the American version was such a disappointment. I'm glad I saw the original version first, and a word of advice: buy the original Ju-On version, not this one."
2,If it didn't sell in Japan why bother with it here?,"The story was hard to nail down, so I'm still not quite sure what the grudge was supposed to be. The story bounces around so much that the viewer is never really aware of who's who and what's going on. Confusing story telling to say the least.Bad acting, bad writing, bad directing. The only thing remotely scary about this movie is the sound the thing makes, now that was creepy. Watch it if you want, but don't say I didn't warn you. Some may love it. I'm a spooky horror movie fan from way back, if I didn't like it you can bet it's not a great movie. But as they say, to each his own."
1,"Boring , predictable and overrated.","I'm tired of horror movies with creepy little kids in them. They make me sick, this movie made no sense. The ghosts take their anger out on other people because THEY died? Get a life... literally!"
1,"Wow, This Is A Sorry Movie...","Bad, horrible, not at all like the movies it is often compared to (The Ring, The Village, etc). Do not waste your time on this crap. Watching paint dry is a bit more suspenseful..."
2,This movie was absolutely ridiculously. A funny joke!! haha,This movie was just...BAD! So you show an Asian boy making a scary face and that's suppossed to scare me??? hahahaha...C'mon man! This movie is an embarrassment to the horror genre! When will greedy film studios stop releasing barely-near sub-par spoiled manteca? Get real!
1,This is the best movie I have ever seen in my life the entire time I was on the edge of my seat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ahdufhlvurhkfhb???,Everyone listen to me they are coming and there is no escape they will chew on us and make us die the bunnies will fly over the rainbow to us and we shall die the bunnies need to take our souls and offer us to the Easter Bunny!!! there is no way to stop the bunnies and we will be thier slaves and the world will end that is why we need to stop the violens before it is to late THE BUNNIES ARE WATCHING US!!!!! any it was a great but bad movie never watch it!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Pure Garbage,"What a joke. I guess the makers of this movie thought that everyone in the U.S. has nothing better to do but watch people attempt to act. Absolute horrible movie. Turned it off after about half hour.Isn't there anyone out there that can put out a true supernatural freakshow. Sorry folks, but the last really scary movie I have seen was The Changeling from 1980."
1,It really sucked,"Horror movies are a dime a dozen now, and nothing really speical about them anymore. Sad to say, considering its probably my faviorte genere. This movie was a disappointment from the start. Whoever did editing on this movie needs to be fired. I mean they are standing there talking, and it just cuts away when you think something is going to happen. I didnt watch the whole movie, it sucked that bad. I bought this movie used, and I'd gladly give it back to the owner free of charge."
2,Get ready to be.....disappointed!,"Usually I am not the kind of person who enjoys horror movies but sometimes you just feel like having a good scare.A friend of mine came over one evening and we rented 'the Grude', We were all set. We turned of all the lights, lit a few candles, had all the stuff we needed in hand reach and started the movie.We waited, and waited......and waited some more but no scary things happened. We were terribly disappointed. It was nothing like we had expected. It had an occasional scare but not the ones that give you a racing heart.My advice for people who want to see this movie would be; rent another one!"
1,Buffy - The Horror Genre Slayer,"I couldn't wait to watch this movie. I thought the plot was superb. The acting was terrific. And the CGI and FX where the best I've ever seen. The main ghost women looked so realistic. And Buffy looked great. I haven't seen acting so great & terrific since Scooby-Doo. The ghosts in this film are so scary to look at.Now I'll stop being sarcastic and give you the words to decode my review.I couldn't wait to = I unwittingly suffered through this...superb = crapterrific = patheticbest = worst.realistic = s##t houselooked great = made me wanna puke as usual.great & terrific = badScooby Doo = Debbie Does Dallasare so scary = Are constipated looking dummies that should have been designed to look more like Michael Jackson if they wanted motionless, falling mannequins to look scary."
1,Worst Movie I've ever seen in my life.,"I would rate it zero stars, if not for the minimum 1-Star rating choice. I pre-bought 2 tickets to see this at a local theatre back in November. I then secured a babysitter and told my wife we were going out. She was delightfully surprised and she asked what I was taking her to see. I said, ""lets just go, it was #1 in the theatre in it's first week of release."" Let me just say that roughly 10 minutes into the movie, she hit me in the arm, because I picked out a bad movie. I told her we could just leave and go to dinner. She said, ""maybe it will get better"" It didn't. Afterwards, when walking out of the theater, another couple was blabbing about how bad it was and we commiserated together and all 4 of us stated what a colossal waste of 2 hours it was.The acting is pitiful. There isn't a single noteworthy exchange of dialogue between any characters the entire feature. The only reason I am writing this is to save 2 hours of your life."
2,Horror Flick,"An American nurse comes to work in Tokyo. She encounters a vengeful spirit that possesses its victims. She must find a way to break it. Overall, as a lame horror flick rental it was not bad, but I wouldn't want to see it again, nor would I recommend it."
2,I saw the Japanese version first...,"I like the Japanese Version (Ju-on) more. Now, the hollywood producers are running out of ideas and have to borrow (or buy) ideas from other foreign markets and re-produce it to fit the American audiences. The funny thing is: American audiences seem to like it and do find it fresh. Personally, I do find it boring and predictable, not something new or interesting. I have seen them all. Not much for me to say about this film. How come people can give such a long review!?!?!? Huh?Honestly, I DON'T find them scary at all."
5,"So, So, Scary",This movie is so scary I loved this movie it was so cool It was very scary. Somebody please buy this movie please it is so awsome. It had great special effects to.From KarenSmith.
3,"THE GRUDGE WAS CLOSE, BUT DIDN'T GIVE THE GOODS","IN SOMEWHAT OF AN ATTEMPT TO TRY TO BRING THE ORIGINAL BACK UP TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL, THEY SEEM TO GET LOST WITH TOO MUCH DETAIL AND TOO MANY STORIES FOR YOU TO HANDLE.kAREN IS IN A MENTAL INSTITUTION AND OF COURSE HER SISTER COMES. KAREN DIES AND SO AUBREY IS LEFT TO SOLVE THE CRIME. BUT THERE ARE ALSO OTHER STORIES. ABOUT 5 TO BE ALMOST CORRECT, ABOUT HOW THE GRUDGE IS SPREADING.NOW, IT HAD A GOOD STORY, DON'T GET ME WRONG. BUT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THEY ADDED TO MUCH OF A STORY TO BEGIN WITH. IT IS CINFUSING, BUT HAS SOME CREEPY PARTS. NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL, AND COULD HAVE BEEN WAY BETTER."
2,Blah,"This movie is boring. Not scary, not original, just a pointless American remake. Go buy Ju-On! This movie was made for 13 year old teenie boppers."
4,People are a bit harsh,"Ok, i Owned the original Japanese Ju-on series (all 4) and find that this is really just falling prey to people who were upset at the female lead or made statements as to it being hard to follow; as if they had never seen the originals or maybe even the first remake... or even rating it due to the theatrical version. I felt there was at least more to chew on for back story; completing the over-all work as a whole. His seperate/broken storyline is exactly the same as in the originals, so complaining about being able to follow the story is pointless if you have watched all of them. Yes, it has been tamed for American tastes as a whole. I enjoyed the ""director's cut"" and felt it did the series justice; he left the house in Grudge 2 for Japan as well. I enjoyed the additions to the original characters and the only part i felt oddly about was the growing lack of Japanese customs and the increasing ability of Japanese(played by Chinese)knowing fluent English in this version."
2,It was okay,"The Grudge was an okay movie, one of those ones that just barely holds your interest enough to make you want to finish it. It's also one of those movies that is hard to describe the plot without giving spoilers, because it jumps back and forth through time, making it next to impossible to follow in a logical sequence.There weren't any real surprises-- plenty of people following the old dictum of going through ""That Door""-- you know the one where everyone in the theater shouts, ""Don't go through that door!"" The people also climbed stairs and went into dark rooms without turning on lights-- plenty of people just begging to be victims.This would probably be a good date movie to watch at the drive-in theater but watching it on the home DVD player just didn't deliver the expected chills and thrills."
4,love it!! =)),"Im from sydney, im glad i ordered,its quick and easy, im satisfied with the product because it was nice,neatly packed and it took less than 2 weeks before i received the product i guess..quicker than i expected to be honest, as a matter of fact i ordered 2 more ju on films here (The Grudge Unrated Director's Cut) and (Ju on White Ghost/Black Ghost),same as the grudge 2, good packaging and i got the movies less than 2 weeks aswell, for that im happy, thanx!"
2,"Mediocre writing, directing, and acting","Japanese films have a long tradition of ghost stories, both played for scares and morality lessons. The new wave of ghost stories have caught on in the West but the results are bumpy. Grudge 2 doesn't have the surprise factors that the first movie did and has to rely on other devices to be engaging. It fails. Many of the scenes have the actors slowly walking around dark rooms and then finding something, maybe a ghost, maybe a body, maybe someone just hiding. Sound familiar? It has all the conventional scenes of horror films and none of what made Grudge a thrilling scary ride. I prefer mystery to horror and gore so I liked the Grudge well enough. However Grudge 2 oculd easily be skipped."
1,A PATHETIC RING WANNABE THAT BEGS A SATIRE,"THE GRUDGE was predictable and trite with the scariest thing about this movie being Sarah Michelle Geller's acting. The ghosts, as the movie progressed, took on an almost silly feel. I half expected a bathroom scene with one of them jumping out of the toilet!Add to all of the nonsense the fact that the viewer can never quite figure out what the ghost does to people. Does it suck out all of your air? Does it eat part of your face off and leave you a wandering zombie? Does it breathe on you after a lunch of really strong garlic bread and onion rings? Or does it just have a really big frog in its throat and is frantically begging for someone to perform the Heimlich maneuver?At least in THE RING the demon's doings were consistently evil. I can't wait for the satires and parodies on this one. The filmmakers should have a total heyday!THE HORSEMAN"
2,confused bad and boring,"If you havent seen the movie - DONTThis film was bad enough to be bad, but not bad enough to be funny. (except now whenever I burp... If youve seen the movie you know what Im talking about.)I probably should have seen the japanese version instead. One of my co-workers suggested that this film had good cinematography - so I gave it a chance. I cant say I was impressed. Too dark for the small screen - I think I enjoyed one shot in the entire film.the film was a mess. It wasnt scary it was random. theres no sense of build or suspense. Was the story non linear? Or did it have bad continuity? Perhaps I lost interest and it just seemed to jump around.There were some shots that seemed to reference carnival of souls - which was cool. But that cheesey low budget film from 50 years ago was a much more masterful horror movie than the grudge."
1,NOT A GOOD SEQUEL!,"SO WOW, THE GRUDGE GETS TO GO TO ALL OVER THE WORLD TO KILL PEOPLE,(WHO CARES)! PLUS IT HAD THE SAME SCENES FROM ""PART ONE"" LIKE THE INFAMOUS PART WHEN THE GRUDGE GOES UNDER THE COVER IN THE BED TO GET THE VICTIM! JUST SEEING THAT SAME SCENE TWICE BUT JUST IN ANOTHER MOVIE WAS AWFUL! NO BLOODY KILLING SCENES AT ALL, JUST PEOPLE GETTING PULLED INTO THE GROUND QUICKLY LIKE A LOONEY TOON RABBIT HOLE! I UNDERSTAND THAT THE DIRECTOR IS TRYING HIS HARDEST TO KEEP THE MOVIE ALIVE,BUT IT SHOULD OF JUST ENDED WITH PART ONE! PART ONE WAS GREAT,BUT THIS ONE IS A LITTLE ON THE CORNY SIDE!THE GRUDGE 2 AND THE RING 2 SHOULD OF NEVER BEN MADE! ONLY A 9YR OLD SHOULD BE SCARED BY THIS GARBAGE!"
4,a view from an outsider,"Im not usually drawn to horror but we decided 2 rent this film after there was nothing else left. Not being a particular horror fan I had never viewed its japanese version nor have a seen over ""classics"" like the ring. Both my girlfriend and i found this film pretty hard to watch (especially my other half who ran off part way through). And although yes you can tell whats going to happen in parts and know exactly when to look away this film does seem to add original moments, and is good for a bit of shock horror. Enjoy."
1,Dreadful film,"Having watched the original Japanese Grudge 2 I didn't think it could possibly get worse but nope, the American version even beat that one.A pointless plot that goes nowhere (The same croaking female ghost with disjointed body movements, the little boy with the large eyes that turns into a cat every now and again and the mad ex hubby thrown in at the end (That is, if you can be bothered to watch that far, personally I was busy tidying up the living room by that time))For some reason the director of these films seems to think viewers are going to be scared out of their minds by a Japanese woman with large eyes and a hair loss problem which sadly (for him at least) they are not. Not even throwing in a majority American cast (Even though the film is set in Japan) Is going to convince the audience.Avoid at all costs, there are far better things to be doing with 2 hours of your life."
5,Whats the difference between the theatre and unrated cuts?,"Whats the difference between the theater and unrated cuts? I love this movie, but couldn't tell the differenceIf u can tell me, please email me on taylor111133@hotmail.com"
2,Thin on plot and chills,This movie was a big disappointment. I should have learned my lesson years ago that I should ignore the critics and pay attention to moviegoers reviews on online sites. This movie has about two pages of plot which is dragged out for a full length movie. It isn't scary. The creepy atmosphere gets tedious as the plot doesn't move along. The supposedly scary moments are old hat and just get boring with repetition. A loser.
1,The Sludge,"This was the second worst film I saw in the theaters in 2004 (the worst was Van Helsing). The Grudge was VERY boring. The script was horrible as was the directing. It was poorly acted (and I'm sad to say that because I really do love SMG). Very few scary or even interesting moments. If someone else hadn't paid for my ticket I would have been VERY sad that I wasted my time and money with this thing. Barely worth a rental much less a purchase. These PG-13 ""scary"" movies and remakes are watering down the horror genre."
1,Fooled again!,"I was fooled again into thinking that someone could make a scary movie in modern times. I saw this at the theater and as I had expected, but hoped against, I was so ticked off at the stupid ending that it ruined the entire movie, in retrospect. Just like ""the ring"" was pretty scary up until the end, this movie follows perfect suit. I dont recommend it unless you are into this sort of thing. And to think they are thinking about ""Grudge Part 2"". I wont be fooled again, that's for sure."
4,JU-ON 2,"this american version of ""THE GRUDGE"" is a creepy new addition to the horror movie world. although it played more like a part2 rather than a remake of the original(""JU-ON"") i still loved it! well worth the money so you can take a gander every halloween season! i recommend Takashi Shimizu's original version to go along with his american version as a 1-2 punch. ENJOY!"
2,"Not a bad movie, just doesn't make sense","This movie wasn't bad. I had scary moments. But overall it made no sense. It's like the girl from the Ring gets up, walks around, scares people, the end. No real reason for killing people, no method, no back story, hardly a front story really. It's over and you're thinking ""Why did any of this happen?"" Also it seems they ran out of money as the movie ends in the space of about 5 minutes."
3,Kind of overrated,"This movie was extremely popular and supposedly scared the hell out of a lot of people. This films popularity and scariness were lost on me. It is a well made movie, but it's very predictable and unrealistic. As if any ghost movie is realistic. The Grudge stars Sarah Michelle Gellar, whom I regard as an average actress. I don't think she can single handedly carry a movie on her back and make it a classic. Nonetheless people like the hell out of this movie. I don't get it though. The ghost that is after her crawls around on the floor. It is able to follow her out of the house that it is supposedly haunting, but it's just not spooky.I can't really think of anything to say about this movie. It's not bad, but it's not good either. The one amazing thing about The Grudge is how overrated it is."
4,loyal grudge fan,"As a loyal grudge fan, despite all of the negativity its been lately. If ya didnt like the first one, then don't buy or rent to next ones. I'm just saying I like all of the grudge movies especially this first one. So long story short, I like it!"
2,This movie was a joke,Are you kidding the creators of this movie should of got a sticker that said im special because me and my cousin could of made this movie in the basment. if anything that was good about the movie was the very begining i wont give anything away.
1,Does not compare to the original at all,"This is a remake of the Asian film Ju-on and sadly, does not live up to the original at all.I'm a horror buff of over 3 decades and to me, Ju-on was intense and genuinely scary. In fact, it is one of my all time favorites...With this in mind, I found the remake very disappointing. It seemed that everything that made the original so chilling was either changed or omitted. The parts that were changed were done so with special effects that were, I suppose, to give the film a more polished look. For me, this only served to make the film predictable. This, along with changes made in the storyline (to make it more mainstream?) took so much away from what could have been (in my opinion) one of the scariest films in years.The original, subtitled version is certainly in my top 10, if not top 5 scariest films.Ju-on (The Grudge)"
1,Ha?,"This is supposedly the story of a curse that is born and keeps on being reborn, when someone dies in great rage and extreme sorrow. According to that, I'm the best candidate for the next ""Grudge"", simply because of the pain and sorrow induced from watching this movie!"
2,Don't Believe The Hype,I had great expectations for this film but was sorely disappointed. The story jumps time periods frantically that you never really get attached to the plot. The story is also a bit vague. The actors are poorly cast (sorry SMG) with Grace Zabriskie giving the only inspiring performance (as per usual) as a bed ridden invalid...and that ain't saying much. What was up with the frog noises? How did all these Americans end up in Japan and find such bad luck? The film requires an extreme suspension of disbelief that just leaves the viewer bored.
2,Grudgingly,"I'd watch it again, but it's not something i'd waste money on. I'd see it, just for a good story, but borrow it from a friend or somethin'."
2,Why didn't it scare me this time!!!???,"The curse of failing to succeed with a sequel is what happened to The Grudge 2 juse like The Ring 2. The film is not scary anymore because they are so predictable and the scary stuff is so much like the first film. So when the story is not as interesting as the first, it just won't work. It was still worthed for me because I was interested in seeing Jennifer Beals and Hong Kong's Edison Chen. They both tried their best to turned in a good performance for roles that are so mediocre. I really liked the first Grudge and was very scared by it, but this sequel just didn't have the same impact as a horror film. The scary images just got a bit annoying somehow. How many times can you find screaming ghost boy and crooked ghost crawling to be a scary thing to watch?"
5,The Grudge (Unrated Director's Cut),I am a huge fan of Japanese horror and this cross over was just as good as the original. I picked this copy up after having watched the original theatrical version.In the Unrated cut you get a bit more on the why and how of the haunting. All in all I would have to say that if you are left wondering about the story in the regular cut then this is the one to buy. I loved it!
3,"One of the scariest ghost movies, but the ending....","This mvie was really scary when I first saw this, usually ghost movies are so boring at the beginning and the action starts around the ending, but in this movie, the terror kept going on and on. And the ghost's voice is getting really annoying. But the ending was stupid, did Sarah really think it was over just by burning down the house? No, next thing you know, the ghost was right behind her at the ending. And why did her boyfriend or husband not move when he was at the house, and what did the ghost do to him? I hope Grudge 2 would be better."
3,Arrrrggggghhhhh!,"Some really great ideas and effects all tied together by - wait where's the plot? Oh yeah, the plot was an undying desire for another sequel! Almost everything that had some sense of interest lead to dead ends (which I'm sure the director was hoping to inspire a sequel - yeah just said that no no wrong wrong). Usually a movie like this will provide more insight into events (even just to lead you to implications or inspire thoughts of what is going on) but that aspect of this movie was comatose. However I would recommend watching this movie - but good for a sleepy rainy day rental (or borrow from the library) - the ideas have so much promise! Like one scene, where the character was pulled away into wherevers-ville and the sweatshirt being worn drops to the ground - fantastic bites, but no meal."
3,"As far as sequels go, this one isn't bad.","I'm a fan of ""The Grudge"". I thought it was a very well put together horror flick and delivered the scares in a new way. The sequel doesn't really do much different, but it is still rather chilling at times, and adds a bit more to the backstory of how the curse took place. Not as good as the first one, but by far not a disappointment either."
3,"Once You've Seen ""The Grudge"", You've seen it all","A friend gave me this film because they saw that I liked the original remake, ""The Grudge"". However after giving the film a good search through, I decided there was really nothing new about the sequel - just a new fresh victim that the main character, Kakayo, can attack.I wonder why the director chose to bring out a sequel to his own ""remake"" - considering he is remaking his films for the American audience, because it doesn't add anything new."
2,Meow..,"This movie is like the ring to me. Both were unninteresting and not scary. Besides the shining and certain exceptions, I usually don't get scared during unrealistic horror movies. This one isn't scary, and tries to scare you by randomly showing someone's eye on the screen. That's not what I call scary. The plot centers around a haunted house in Japan, and everyone that enters this house shall die. This is due to some curse and of course when Sarah Michelle Gellar goes inside it, she's got to find a way to save herself. And of course, her boyfriend wants to die too so he goes in also. Just like the boyfriend in the ring. The movie isn't particullarily scart, and if you dissliked the ring like me, you won't like this. But if you liked it, you'll love it. Oh, and by the way, the little boy that makes cat noises (Meowwwww) isn't scary! That's got to be the stupidest thing ever! I found myself laughing every time he'd Meow. Well, anyway, that's all I've got to say."
2,the grudge,"The cover looks cool and scary so I must warn you. You CANNOT trust a book or DVD by its cover!! I'm serious, I do not understand why this movie was supposed to be scary. I felt like been there done that a million times before. This movie, despite a strong cast, just didn't do it for me."
3,"The Grudge: A Confusing, Scary, Weird Movie","The Grudge was a very confusing movie! I had to watch the DVD twice to understand the main concept!PROS- A Very Scary movie- Very Excellent Graphic Effects- A Great Performance by Sarah Michelle Gellar- A great remakeCONS- The scary parts of the movie are not very original- The movie can be very confusing at times- Some of the images in the movie are a little too disturbing for my tasteBOTTOM LINE- ""The Grudge"" was a good movie, but it wasn't flawlessBUY THIS?- I recommend that you rent this movie first.Thank you for reading this review! I hope I helped out!"
1,TERRIBLE DISSAPOINTING AND STUPID,"Wow, what a total let down! The fact people think this film is scary is rediculous. The special effects were a direct rip-off of ""The ring."" The story? Was there one? Not in my opinion..Just a bunch of flashy imaging. The entire film was a boring, stupid, mess. I guess there is always a market for bad films with good marketing campaigns. However, this is the worst horror film I have seen in years. And that Buffy chick? Well, she's a bad actress! As plastic as Barbie and just as talented..No, wait, that would be an insult to BARBIE! I suppose many kiddies helped this film at the box ofice as it was PG-13, and had it been rated R, it would have bombed IMO! Stupid movie!"
1,What a waste of time!,"If you enjoy movies where everything gets quiet and then something scary jumps out with a loud noise, this one is for you. It happens over, and over, and over... meanwhile the plot is straight line and absurdly simple, the characters are there just long enough for us to figure out who they are before they get bumped off, and the editing makes for confusing time cuts so you'll have something to think about because otherwise there is nothing in this movie for you."
1,Proof that dead people are smarter than actresses,"These ""The Ring"" type horror movies are getting old fast.And how is it that the ghost/monster/spirit/little girl creature can use a phone and the victims automatically regress to Neanderthal levels of intelligence right on cue.Go get ""Saw"" or better yet, John Carpenter's ""Prince of Darkness""."
2,A Failed Experiment,"I don't have a problem with movies employing non-linear narratives--Memento and The Limey do this very well. The Grudge fails not because of the narrative structure, but because we never settle on whose story this is. It is distributed too thinly among too many characters. Despite the fact that Gellar gets top billing, it doesn't seem to be any more her story than any of the other characters.Still, there are some effective images (and sounds!)--they would be very much more effective, though, if the writer had allowed us to develop a connection with the characters."
2,Not scary at all and almost boring,"okay I saw this movie after have heard good critics about it.But,well after have seen it, I wonder how you can love it or be frightened by it.It is slow,the story is a classic in horror type movie, and actors don't really elevate the level.I used to have a weakness for horror movie but I'm not crazy about it, and to be honest this one sucks...It's not gore at all and you can presume that the realisator atempted to build a frightening atmosphere but it doesn't work on me : pointless story and the end is stupid( can't find another word...)I rate it 2 stars because I don't like to give just 1.trust me you can skip this ""kind of"" horror movie."
4,Yaaaaa,This Movie is good a good movie is just what I needed but still not Great like Catwoman The Ring 2 and Legally Blonde.
2,Ok Comedy...,"I give it 2 stars just because it had me and my friends cracking up when we went to see it, but as a horror film (the genre it was intended) it is an absolutely terrible waste of time."
1,This movie indeed did have suck and such,"I liked how it took place in Japan, Chickensaurus. I thought that was cool. I thought it might be a pretty good movie, but once Sarah Michelle Gellar saw the darkhair and eyeballs coming from the ceiling. SCARY. and then I lost it; didn't know what was going on. No more Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It seemed. What the are you doing here. Over here. Bill Pullman, the President and Lone Star -- I think his career is going down the crapper if this role is any indication. But that is about it. Quite Frankly with Steven A. Smith, I did not know what the hell was going on in this movie.Here are movies, Similar to this genre I liked:Jeepers Creepers (part 2 sucked)Signs (I like all Night Shyamalan's)Didn't Like:Blair WitchDark Water (Currently in theatres)"
1,"I gotta hold a ""Grudge"" here...","Let me just get this off my chest...for the love of God, just because the Ring was a surprise horror hit, could you please stop trying to copy it in every horror film! This film has the same cheesy lighting and imagery that 'the Ring' did. The main terror in this film is bottom line, a naked asian boy who meows. That scares me, but not in a horror way. Sarah Michelle Gellar is not bad nor any of the actors cast in here, they just weren't given much and unfortunately neither were we. Catch it on cable or satelite tv late one night, then forget it. Not one you want to waste adding to the collection."
1,poor movie,Poor Sarah Michelle Gellar she had to suffer through the making of this terrible film. Lets see there is too much in common with the ring and I loved the ring but that is not a good thing. I mean they took the girl from the ring and made her look different and that was the villain. Don't waste your time on this one.
2,What can I say.........................,"When my family decided to see the movie The Grudge, I was totally stoked. The previews seemed awesome and I totally looked foward seeing it. After the first half hour I was bored. It was an extremely dull movie with a simple, simple story line thrown in with special affects and loud music. One thing I hated with the movie was that it jumped around showing the different affects that the grudge affected all of the characters. I'm sure that the japenese movie is highly more eventful then dull 1 hour and 45 minutes was. It was truly a waste of $7.00 (canadian)."
4,The movie gets 4 stars...,"This idea does not however. I'm sorry, but they should have released a unrated version to begin with. I already own the first one, but I would rather be able to see the unrated one also, so now I'll have two copies of the same freakin' movie? That doesn't seem fair to me that they couldn't have just released it when they released the original. Or at least mentioned that there would be an unrated version being released. I would have waited had I known that they are going to do anything in their power to get as much money from people as possible. PATHETIC."
2,A barely there thriller,"The Grudge had its share of jumpy moments and freakiness. But the actual story is somewhat dissapointing. People enter and house and get mysteriously killed off one by one. Ok, sounds interesting. But in reality, it was on the slow side. I just couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters, and I think that weakened the movie for me. The premise is interesting, but it just didn't deliver."
3,Really not bad at all,"If you liked the first one, or Ju-On: The Grudge, you'll probably enjoy this one as much as I did. Ignore the terrible reviews and get an opinion of your own. For what it is - an endless stream of disconnected scares, it works. If you want a creepy nightmarish film, watch it."
4,Scary as hell...,"I saw this movie at the movie theater with couple of my friend. Since I'm not a horror movie person, I had to close my eyes throughout half of the movie. It's very scary and you don't expect when something scary happens. It's a good movie though and the actors played very well. Just don't watch it alone."
2,This Movie is a Clunker. Please Don't Hold a Grudge,"Supposedly the story of an American nurse living in a haunted house in Tokyo where she is exposed to a mysterious curse that locks a person in a powerful rage before claiming their life and spreading to another victim. Well, that story line is so hard to follow in this nonesensical jump-out-of-the-dark scare 'em up that I don't even know myself why I started the review that way.Let me start again: This is a movie that has Buffy the Vampire Slayer and a lot of scary images that literally pop out at the viewers with a loud, bassy BONG. The story line is hard to follow, and after watching I had to read the back of the DVD case to see what this flick was supposed to be about.There...that's a better start to the review. And a good way to end it. Don't buy this; rent it if you must (or catch it on cable), but don't say I didn't warn you. Want something better that I was reminded of throughout this flick?...TryThe Ring.The Grudge is a clunker."
3,OK . But why Americans?,"This is a pretty good movie, perhaps more sickening than terrifying. In fact, I like it a lot better than the Japanease original. However, I hadn't known that the film was shot in Japan until I actually saw it. So my question is: why Americans? Did they just happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time? I think the film would have been more meaningful had there been more cross-cultural viewpoints in it. But then they are just dealing with the inexplicable, so perhaps it doesn't matter whether they are Americans or Japanese. And of course they were able to save the house. So the saga continues..."
5,Scary good!,"This film surprised me. I'm not the kind of guy that gets scared by movies. I loved The Ring, M Night Shyamalan films, Hitchcock films, and plenty of slasher films, but they never scared me - I just found them suspenseful. However, this movie totally freaked me out. The music is perfect and the camera angles are extraordinary. More American directors need to learn how to create mood the way Shimuzu does. I pride myself in not jumping back during a scary part but found myself kept doing it. This film has a great story line, awesome scary moments, and good acting (all without gore and slashing with knives and I think only one or two swear words). I hope we can see more movies like this in Hollywood - I always find it funny when Hollywood is surprised when a movie like this does well in the box office and a remake of Bad News Bears or The Honeymooners tanks! Great original movie (although a Japanese remake)!"
4,Not as bad as people make it out to be,"I thought this was a solid horror flick, with the exception of the ending. I don't understand why it's hated so much. It's a horror movie. What did you expect? It has it's flaws, but it delivered exactly what I expected."
2,Still Confused,"There has to something in Japanese movies that I don't get. Thinking of The Ring and The Grudge of two movies that I don't understand at all.When I read about the movie, it sounded promising: young American woman residing in Japan with her boyfriend. She is temporarily assigned to be a caretaker for a woman with severe sleeping conditions. The house is plagued by the presence of murderous ghosts, the result of a curse. The curse is born from someone dying in a powerful rage. Seemed interesting enough but I was wrong. It's almost as if there should have been a prequel to this movie. I don't even know if I'd recommend it or not... I'm still confused."
2,Ho-Hum!,"Isn't it strange how you can watch a movie with a group of people and some will love it, some will hate it and some will just say, ""ho-hum!"" Well, that was the scene at my home as we watched The Grudge.I have to admit that there were several times when we all jumpedand some of the scenes had that scary surprised element, but most of us find it very frustrating to just sit and watch a house and some cat and little boy running around. It took most of the movie to even find out there was a curse put on the house.Now, my sister-in-law thought it was very scary, so go figure.Personally I was bored and frustrated with this moive and was glad when it was over, but you decide. To each his own."
3,some good scary stuff but thats it...,"i found this flick to be scary but very hard to follow, and not only that but it was like a bunch of scary ghost clips strung together. Over all not to bad."
3,This movie probably had potential but....,"I was told by lots of people that this movie was really scary so my expectations were pretty high.With that, I watched (tried to watch is more accurate) this movie somewhat confident that I'd like it.Now, the actors did well, the lighting kept the movie visually scary and the story was probably good... unfortunately, I had to turn it off before it was over.The belching ghost just totally took away any scare factor that this movie had. Why would you add something like that? I don't get it. There's tons of scary noises out there to use but you chose a belch?This is one of two movies that I've ever shut off without finishing, House of the Dead was the second one.Like I said, this movie is good, I just got messed up from the belch sound, it took away the goal of the movie: scare factor."
3,and away we go,"I'm a fan of In Extremo and after listening to them for awhile I wanted to check out some other medieval rock bands to see what else was out there. I came across these guys so I decided to give them a chance and I bought this best of cd because it would have songs from many of their albums.The cd's not bad but it just didn't grab my attention that much and it was forgettable except for a couple of songs. I didn't care for the singers voice I just thought that it was annoying most of the time, there wasn't really any fast rock songs and they didn't have as much of a medievel sound to them like In Extremo. A few of these songs are good and a couple are okay but overall I was disappointed and I won't be buying anymore of their cd's. Most of the songs are sung in German and the lyrics along with some pictures are included in the jacket.I would recommend this cd to anyone who likes folk rock that isn't as strong as In Extremo and to any fans of Subway to Sally."
4,Oldie But Goodie,"While this says it is a beginner's guide, climbers of all levels will benefit from a quick scan of it to remind themselves of basic principles. It is easily scanned.And although it was published in 1977 before the revolution in gear and clothing, the basic keys to success and survival in the mountains are preparation and a calm understanding of the risks and options. This book provides a readable, commonsense introduction to these and is therefore still valuable.Add to it the latest GoreTex and chocks and you will be well equiped for the rigors of mountain climbing in the 21st century."
3,Ok,I bought this for my Dad. He did not really like it as he said it was too small. He is kinda old and grouchy so the product is probably fine.
4,clothes pin bag,"This is a blue and white stiped cotton clothes pin bag. It coordinats nicely with the blue and white plastic clothes pins also sold by Stacks and Stacks. The dimensions listed in the description are acurate. It hasn't been in use long, but appears to be well made and has held up nicely to my two year old sons abuse. It is a basic item and is exactly what i expected it to be."
1,CLOTHS PIN BAG,THIS IS A CHEAP MADE BAG. SHOULD ONLY COST $1.O0 FOR THE CHEAP FABRIC AND HOW IT IS MADE.
5,ROFLOL!,"I haven't even PLAYED this game but based solely on Detra's review I'm going to buy one for my grandkids and for me. I'm sure my grandsons will become an experts at ""chuzzlebugging"" in no time, lol.Hat's off to Detra. What a great review. I'd love to see these kinds of reviews more often. It really makes a difference to shoppers.Thanks, Detra"
2,Not a book for inquisative people,"This book was very appualing, it was not up to the caliber of the books I usually read. There was not very much controvercy, that you would expect from a book like this. Although the complexity of the few decent stories that they had, it was very easy to understand. My son got ahold of this book, and was soon asking me all there questions about abortion. I thought it to be very unappealing. It offered a weak collection of essays from both side of the operating table. But, my friend, Brad Bucholtz (who lives in Berlin, WI) liked it very much, he bought 10 copies of this book for his whole family!"
3,"I love boggle, but it's a little harder to play this way.","Boggle is a fun game, and although this keychain is durable and portable, it's hard to play with. The letters are hard to get to stay on one side, the timer is short, and it doesn't open to push over stubborn blocks. I would still get the real game, and only get this for times where you're afraid the pieces might get lost."
4,Anyone for coffee and a boggle?,"I LOVE boggle. I am not really any good at it, and I lose A LOT, but I LOVE boggle.This little carabiner has proven to be a fun, portable, play anywhere addition.The timer clicks into place very securely, so I haven't had any worries about losing it.And while I like the non removable lid, I have to agree that it would be MUCH better for game play if it were clear and sans boggle logo for better visibility. (That's the only reason it lost a star, though I would have preferred to take off only a half star.)All in all for the money spent it's been great.I'm now known to play a few rounds at coffee with the girls, or at night when the kids are in bed, (it's MUCH quieter than the original.)And even without using it for game play its a super cute conversation piece. :)"
2,Bad cover design makes it harder to see the letters.,"Overall concept is good and it works in a pinch. However, unlike the regular boggle the cover does not come off. This would not be a problem except the bends in the cover edges and the prominently placed raised logo on the top of the cover distort the cover and make reading the letters difficult. This required me to change my point of view to see all the letters clearly, which made playing the game less enjoyable."
3,Boggle Game Carabiner,"I was very pleased to see how small it is, and also that it is self contained. You do have to flip the hour glass timer 3 times to equal the amount of time you would have on the hour glass you have on the full size Boggle game. Inconvenient, but understandable. There were however, two things that I really do not like about it. The edges on the dome block out an entire row of letters if you look from a normal angle. To compensate for this, you have to look at the letters from directly above to see all of the letters clearly. Since this is the only way to see all of the letters clearly, it is annoying to find that you then have to look through an imprint of the word ""Boggle"" right in the middle of the dome.I have loved Boggle since I was a child, and also love miniatures, so I am still happy to have it for those reasons."
3,A decent travel option for Boggle addicts,"We're Boggle addicts, and we purchased this for an international trip, where we obviously didn't want to tote the full-size game. It met our needs, but we found it a bit frustrating to use. The plastic cover that sits over the letters is permanently attached, which means when you're playing, the corner/seam on each side of the cover blocks your view of some of the letters. Also, the timer is only one minute, so you have to keep more of an eye on it, and flip it a couple times to get to three minutes.That said, it's very compact and it's handy that the timer snaps into the main gamepiece, so you don't have to worry about losing any parts. We'll continue to take this on international trips, but will use our regular game for home and road trips."
4,Non-Fiction,"A reasonable and nicely illustrated bird book for the country, but certainly has been superseded by some more impressive looking volumes now.However, for the keen bird person having a copy of this to go along with some others is not a bad thing, and picking this up cheap it is still worth having.A good book."
1,TOTALLY BAD &amp; OVER RATED,"SAVE YOUR MONEY, DON'T BUY IT, IT SUCKSI purchased this product and was very dissapointed with it, i found it to be absolutely useless.The handling of the binoculars are difficult, the focal view is limited and the camera sucks, meaning that you can't get a decent quality photo and what photo you do get can't be enlarged with any quality at all. What you see through the binoculars when you snap a picture is not what you get with the camera.This product is one of the worst that i have found so far and don't recomend it to anyone that is in to photography.If one could rate this product LESS THAN ONE STAR it would be a plus for this product."
3,"Ditto, Ditto, Ditto","How can you refuse an idea like this?Any outdoor or sports loving person will be enchanted by the concept.The binoculars are excellent quality. I'm not disappointed in them at all.However, the poor quality of the camera makes this product more of a toy than a tool.If a better quality calendar were placed in this product it would be worth the additional cost."
4,Pretty Good,"My wife bought one for her dad for Christmas. I was given the job of tester. There was a little concern after reading the reviews, but all is fine.I would like one for myself. They may be better in the future, but this is today not the future. If you want one then get it."
1,"No driver or software download available, BEWARE","The driver disk that I have will not work anymore, so I figured that I could download it online. However, it is not available anywhere for download. Now I am stuck with a product that is useless to me. Do not waste your money on this or any other Bushnell product, customer support is non-existent!"
4,"Bushnell Image View ""Good Deal""","The image view is really cool and a pretty good deal in terms of monetary cost. Only draw back is the samn thing needs lotsa light so only expect to use it outside, definitely not inside. Also the resolution could be better, definitely better resolution would be nice. All in all im happy with it, not extatic but its what i expected so its fine for me."
2,Get what you pay for,"The camera with this unit was hardly worth it the low cost. The optics are fine for the price, but built in camera was useless. Unable to obtain a clean shot. I brought it to try this out in the back yard and take some pictures. I figured if I like it I would invest in a more expensive model. In hindsight I should have just saved my money and buy a better model. Buyer beware!!!"
1,Software doesn't work for XP,I think the people that are giving this product 5 stars must work for Bushnell of the software company. It absolutely doesn't work. Don't buy this if you're doing so for it's digital camera.
1,These digital binoculars are a nightmare!!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM...you would do better just throwing you money out of the window. I was so excited to take some distance pics and tried to upload to my computer (XP) and then i got a message ""device not found"" even though I had loaded the software. Well, then I went to the bushnell site and went to the trouble shooters section where i found instructions on how to load the more updated drivers...well that didn't work either....i spent over 3 hours fooling around with this stupid set of binoculars...now, i am ready to throw ""them"" out the window."
1,Garbage for photos,"Complete crap. The installation as mentioned in many other reviews was next to impossible. I bought my mother this before she went on a trip to Alaska, thinking she could bring some nice close up shots to complement her other digital camera shots. But that was not the case, after spending hours trying to get it installed on XP the files were not even the right format. The picture quality was horrible. This product is a joke, I wish I could get my money back, the only good thing about it is that the binoculars work. Better off just buying a pair of those, skip this product and save yourself a headache."
3,Imageview digital camera binoculars,great camera & binoc functions-however software & drivers for this model do not work with Vista or XP. This info was not avail to me before purchase-had to contact bushnell myself to find out. had to return-very disappointed. -KY
2,No updated drivers,"The binoculars worked fine, but I have no idea how the cameral worked. We have 3 computers (laptops) with 3 different operating systems - windows 2000, vista & windows 7. The drivers provided on the CD would not work with any of these. I called Bushnell & was told that there were no available updates. So unless you have a very old computer, I wouldn't buy this model."
1,Dislike!,This product was out of date....camera did not work. Contacted the Bushnell company to speak with customer service and they said that this was a discontinued Binocular because of a defect in the camera. Seller DID return my money. Am VERY SATISFIED WITH SELLER AS FAR AS RETURNING MONEY but the PRODUCT itself DOES NOT need to still be available to buy.
3,Can not download pictures,The product was ordered for my husband. Can not download pictures because this product is not compatible with my Apple computer. The product description does not mention this bit of important information.
1,Save your money,"Got this as a present. Right off, the drivers would not install, the link to get updated drivers did not work. I emailed them requesting support, never heard from them. I am able to take ""pictures"", but they are distorted and of poor quality. If you can't do anything with them, what is the point. Same your money."
4,Good product,This product is very easy to use. The picture quality is acceptable but I expect that it can be more focused on one small object.
3,gift,"These were given as a gift, the product was easy to set up and use, don't know about the picture quality"
2,Is it a bird or a leaf.,"I love this idea. Take a picture of what you see thru a binocular. However, this camera has it's limits. Not only could I not review the pix (til I got to my PC), the image was NOT what I saw. The yellow bird in the tree, became the tree with a yellow leaf, maybe.The binocular is Great: small, powerful, easy to focus. The tech support thru Bushnell was terrific. Making the PC recognize the camera took one phone call. The op manual needs HELP, or maybe I'm too much of an novice in this field."
1,disappointed,"Was hoping to use this item to get some good shots of birds. Unfortunately, after trying 100 shots (and download to the PC) was not able to get a single decent clear picture. Too low a resolution... too fuzzy... Not sure if this is because I couldn't keep that little unit still or whether the default highest resolution just isn't enough. We already have a 3x digital camera and several decent pairs of binoculars, so will try to return this unit since it just doesn't work as a camera."
4,Not appropriate for hunting,"The product seemed to be good quality. I bought one to use while hunting, to take a quick picture of that trophy buck that walks by during bear season for example. Only one thing wasn't appropriate: It beeps every time you turn it on, off, change functions, or take a picture. And there's no way to switch off the sound. So that makes it a bad choice for hunting, in my opinion."
1,Returned product - regretfully,My wife purchased at Best Buys and gave the binoculars to me as a fathers day gift. I loved the concept and as an avid hiker and birder was anxious to use them. All pictures came out fuzzy and trees were a grayish green with all other colors a sickly sepia toned. I tried various ways of holding the camera to reduce the fuzziness and by holding it at chest level (box camera fashion) seemed to help - but obviously couldn't focus on the subject. After trying it for 3 days I decided to return it to Best Buys. They would not refund but did provide store credit. If Bushnell can fix the camera I will definitely buy the next generation model.
2,A pretty poor offering,"This movie is pretty poor. I couldn't even bring myself to sit through the whole thing. The acting is awful. The storyline is weak. The volleyball is only passable. Actually, given how the team in question is supposedly the defending national champion, it's subpar. That team probably wouldn't win a league championship in the L.A. area, never mind the state or national title. For someone who doesn't know competitive volleyball at that level it might be fine, but I would be hard pressed to recommend it."
5,Movie,"Got this movie for my daughter. She loves it!! Fast Shipping, product came well packaged. Would recommend to everyone who would like to see this movie."
3,Better than you expect,"Not a bad movie. It's the same 'competitive girls' story on different side of tracks story. In the end, like the Bring It On series...you just have fun with it."
5,All You've Got,I had seen the previews of this movie every time I would watch another movie that I owned. The previews were what sold me on the buying of this movie. I finally got it and it was just as great as the previews showed it was. It's rocky road to friendship but they come together in the end. An excelelnt movie all around.All You've Got
4,dvd review,I like this movie it makes you realize how important friendship and commitment really is.
3,all you've got,"the movie itself was average, however there are few movies about volleyball so if you like v-ball it is definitely worth it."
1,Do not order this,"This router is touted as having wifi capability. It doesn't support WiFi. It is being sold as an 1812W-ag-e, when in fact it is an 1812/K9."
3,Very good in some ways,"If you are currently involved with a sex addict this book will help ""fortify"" you. Sex addicts love to blame and point the finger making you feel crazy and awful. The book will also verify that the lying and blaming game being played on you by your spouse is the sex addicts version of AA's for every finger you point at someone else you have four pointing back at yourself. If you are looking for healing I don't think you will find it in this book. But you will find a wake-up call. I gave 3 stars because I found the attempts at ""self help"" questions at the end of each chapter kind of a lame throw in. 5 Stars is perfection. That said, the book is well worth the read."
2,Caution for spouses wanting to read this book,I saw that there were 5 - 5 star reviews of this book and they all seemed to say similar things - it's written from the experience of someone who was married to a sex addict and gives great information for those who might suspect they are etc. I know I'm married to a sex addict but this book was very difficult for me to read and not helpful at all. I was hoping to get some great advice and hope. This book made me think things might be going on that probably aren't and just made me depressed more than I already am. Maybe from the standpoint of someone who specializes in therapy for those recovering from being married to a sex addict the book is helpful but it was way too depressing with way too many details for me (her husband was actually quite cruel in my opinion). Just a warning to someone suffering the affects of being married to a sex addict and is looking for some therapy and hope in a book - I wouldn't recommend this book.
3,It was ok,I was expecting it to be a little more story like boot so biography like. But either way it was ok
2,My Secret Life with a Sex Addict,"After I read this book I really disliked Emma Dawson for not protecting her daughters. Especially when one of the daughter was being raped.She has made so many excuses for herself and expect God and Man to forgive her.Well Emma, I do hope you are in a better place today. Frankly I think you are horrible.I do not recommend your book to anyone. It is a waste of time and energy.Anyone who wants to read this book I would recommend that you listen to some good music or see a movie."
3,Beginning to boost,"A solidly agreeable, if not thoroughly spectacular introduction into one of neo-prog's more committed emulators."
5,A STRONG DEBUT ALBUM,"I consider this album as one of the best. It's really different from those other albums that I bought. This album has everything from Uptempo like ""PRIVATE MOVIE"" to midtempo like ""IF I LET YOU GO"" to soulful ballads like ""FLYING WITHOUT WINGS"", ""SWEAR IT AGAIN"" and ""FOREVER"" (which is not on the American album). With this kind of album there's no doubt that WESTLIFE will not take North America by storm. And one more thing whta's great about this album is that anyone can relate to it. Whether you are a young adult, teenager or an adult you can relate to it, because everyone of us experienced heartaches, falling in love, and that's what's this album is all about, it help us realized that it's ok to fall in love, or even get hurt. Also Westlife is not just a bunch of pretty faces without any talents they actually have talents. Just listen to the album and you would actually hear that they could really sing. That's all! krissy"
5,Westlife are the best,"Hi everyone I am a huge westlife fan I just want to say that they are the best,there album is brilliant as they show how great there voices really are and they are all great looking!You should hear there U.k album it is even better!"
5,The best boy band there is!,I would just like to say that these are the best songs and the best vocals out of any of the boy groups around. The vocals are great and that creates all the songs to take off. With this cd Westlife proves you do not have to have the dance/bubblegum style that all the american boy groups (except 98 degrees)have. I would just like to congraduate this group on a great job and keep up the good work.
2,get the NON-AMERICAN VERSION,"Although the group is great and the album is great, the US version kinda left out some great tunes. When Westlife first came out with their first single ""Swear It Again"" in Manila, i liked it but just really loved the album after hearing their fourth ""Seasons in the Sun"" which sadly is not included in their US Release. So my advise would be to get the Asian or UK version which has all the 17 songs and a different cover, the one with a blue background and 5 heads."
4,"Well, It's just another boys-band.","Well, over all the music is good and very pleasant to listen to. There are some good tracks such as Fool Again, Flying Without Wings, and If I Let You go. they also did a good number on the cover tunes such as Seasons in the Sun.. It is too bad that this song is not on U.S. version. If you listen to this CD several times, you will find out that they sound similar to Boyzone."
1,STOP NOW AND DON'T BUY THIS AMERICAN RELEASE OF WESTLIFE,"The WESTLIFE is great, but american release of this CD is not good because they cut 4 songs. Euro CD has total of 17 greatest sogs while US cd has only 13 songs. I just don't understund ARISTA. Why take out 4 beautiful songs of the CD. Please go and purchase EURO version here on the Amazon. It costs couple dollars more but you will get better CD."
4,Wow...A very Suprising and Good CD!,"This cd is by far the best cd i ever heard from a boy band. There are a lot of good songs. For example, ""Can't lose what you never had"", ""Flying without wings"",""I don't want to Fight"", ""Miss You"" and lots more. The best songs are ""Flying without wings"" and ""Can't lose what you never had"". ""Flying without wings"" is an emotional song that shows how much a person can affect you with his or her love and deepest care. ""Can't lose what you never had"" is a song that shows without telling the person about how you feel you will never get anything out of it. If you do and get rejected, you don't lose anything out of it. if you confess, you might get something good out of it. Being slient won't get you anywhere."
2,Very mediocre,"Another boy band gives another mediocre album. Although some songs are good. Overall it's a pretty dull effort. I got hte album as gift, but didn't like it."
1,WETlife!,"Well, let me get a few things straight before my head explodes, WESTLIFE are NOT the new Boyzone and they are not bloody brilliant. YAWN! Yes, they have had lots of number ones, but they get praised for everything, and everything they do seems to turn to gold and they are very big headed. They think they're it but they are not,they are the biggest thing since cellulite, {or so it seems.}"
2,One long power ballad to me,"While Westlife has some good voices, I just don't like this album as much. It felt like one endless power ballad to me. Nearly all the songs copy the same cliches found in every late-80s heavy metal band power ballad by Bon Jovi, Winger, Poison or some others. Seemed like orchestral arrangements on most of the stuff Most of the ballads were surprisingly bland. There's one or two uptempos, but that's about it. At least Ruben Studdard remade one of their songs, Flying Without Wings, and made it sound better than them. They're not as exciting as Backstreet, not as chance taking as NSYNC. More than Words and Swear It Again were quite good, but they're the only 2 good songs on an otherwise flat-sounding album."
5,you just have to have this album,"Hey i'm jenni from London England, and i am here to tell all you guys in the US of A that Westlife are the most successful boy band in england EVER! the first 5, yes 5, singles all went straight in at NUMBER 1! if there is just one album you should buy this year, please guys let it be this on! although there are 5 less songs on this one which is a shame i still highly reccomend this album. And also go along to one of their concerts or shows- these guys are wicked singers"
5,totally excellent,"I'm really proud being westlife fan! I've been a fan since dec99 and I'm really proud of them finally hitting the US! Well, the CD is really really excellent! I mean, for all you guys who are wanting excellent songs, excellent voices and gorgeous hunks all at one CD.. well, this is it! What actually made this album worth buying is the emotion or they way the songs are sang. Each song is amazing. I love all of the songs (including the 5 additional ones that are found in the original one). And the way they sang it.. it's just really REALLY amazing. Their voices are cool and relaxing. There are a lot of songs that struck me the most. Some of them are ""Flying without wings"" ""If I let You go"" ""We are one"" ""Can't lose what you never had"" and a whole lot more. No wonder they became POP history -- all first 5 singles - STRAIGHT #1. ^_^"
3,NOT INTENDED FOR THE BEGINNER.,"If you're looking to learn how to play upright bass take my advise and buy Todd Phillips ""Essential Techniques for Acoustic Bass"" videos one and two before spending your money on this one. In this video Lee Rocker demonstrates the three different slaps used,then applies them to a couple of rockabilly bass lines. No fundamentals are explained, nor are any basic scales illustrated. Rocker's demonstrations are also too fast for a beginner to follow along to. In short,this video won't be beneficial to the beginner. It's more intended for an intermediate bass player who's looking to develope the rockabilly slap technique. Get a few months of playing under your belt first before buying this one."
3,What's with the nipple?,"I liked the bottle except for the nipple. It's just not my style. The whole pull it out for a sip, then kick it to the side for a gulp just wasn't my idea of a decent design."
1,Highly dubious,"This is the person who ignored hard evidence pointing to the guilty person in order to convict the Central Park 5. An undeserved reputation - but you can understand why her works of fiction are so good. An unprincipled careerist of the first order, impressively manufactures her reputation. Quite how victims of rape are served by the perpetration of further injustice against others is not explained."
3,I Love Lee Van Cleef,I love Lee Van Cleef. What else can one say? It's a cops and robbers of not very high priority but fun.Mr. Beady Eyes - but not unattractive. And not a bad story.
5,a true undiscovered gem,"One of the best releases of 1994, this musical endeavor deserved much more success than it got.The Waterlillies, consisting of lead vocalist/producer/arranger Sandra Jill Alikas and producer/arranger Ray Carroll, turned in a brilliant, polished performance here. Sandra's vocals do the rare feat of working so well on both soaring, hook driven dance cuts (""Tempted"", ""Free"", ""Work it Out"") and heart-breaking ballads (""Never Get Enough"", ""Nolion Doll"", ""Take My Breath Away""). You can practically feel the ache and yearning in her beautiful voice & lyrics. Toss in a tasty instrumental (""Supersonic"") and even end the CD on a superb note, with the haunting a cappella version of the Carpenters' ""Close to You"", and you have one of the best CD's of the year... perhaps of all time.Defintely a keeper, I would recommend this CD to anyone -- even if they're not fans of the genre."
5,More Pease! More!,"This ""Album"" was released in 1994 and is absolutegorgeous ""song-based"" trance-techno album.Unfortunatelly since mainstream media in the U.S.automatically bans anything electronic or anythingwith a house-dance beat, this album got very unfairlyignored. It is definitely one of the best albums ofthe 90s. Every song has the wonderfull siren-femalevoice singer, performing sing-a-long melodies.It definitly puts me in a trance, while giving me a workout.Buy this album! You wont regret it! I wish songwriter RayCarroll makes more albums as Waterlilies, even if independentlyreleased and they could promote it on the web."
5,Comprehensive and Clear,"This video has exceeded my expectations, not only is it comprehensive, it is also very clear. I am a mother of twins and although I have tried to read the big pile of parenting books that are sitting at my home, there is simply no time. This video does a wonderful job in conveying clear and effective ideas for parenting small children, the best possible way, and it does it in only 40 minutes! It is a GEM!DVD is also in Spanish. I loved it, thank you Ula!"
5,This DVD will change your perspective on parenting in general,"I have 1 year old and throughout my pregnancy and the first year of being full-time parent, I was reading books and watching many different documentaries on childhood. This the only DVD that I have seen so far that will change your perspective on parenting in general. Highly recommended."
5,Extremely Accurate,I purchased the Polder Preprogrammed Cooking Thermometer based on the reviews I read at this website and was not disappointed. This is an extremely accurate and simple to use thermometer. My turkeys and roasts always turn out cooked to perfection.
1,LCD Screen Failed - junk,"The idea is good - nice to have an alarm and a thin remote wire that allows the oven door to be kept shut.HOWEVER, After using this product half a dozen times over the course of a year or so, the LCD screen failed. For a while I could sort of guess at the temp based on the remaining segments of the numbers, but finally tossed it in the garbage yesterday. This is not acceptable. There are plenty of other options. No more Polder products for me."
1,Expensive,"I bought the Pyrex version of the same thing for 17 dollars. It has all the features of this one at a MUCH lower price. Also, this product apparently has some dependability issues that make it a bad buy."
1,"If you can't read it, it's useless!","I used this Thermometer properly just as the directions state. The 3rd time I used it the LCD display started malfunctioning, showing only parts of the readout, like a line or two here and there. Basically it is unreadable, and if you can't read it, you have no clue what it's set to, thus making the thermometer useless!DO NOT waste your money."
5,One of my favorite ktichen gadgets,I have owned the Polder thermometer for several years now (4 or 5) and I absolutely love it. I bought it initially just for roasting my turkey to perfection for Thanksgiving. It was perfect. Now I find I use it a couple of times a month. I was surprised by the reviews because I use my Polder so often and have never had any problems. One time the temperatures seemed to be going whack-o. I changed the battery and all was well again. I would highly recommend this device to everyone and am getting ready to purchase one for my mother-in-law for Christmas.
2,Worked for a year,"I have had one of these thermometers for about a year. I use it about once per week. When it worked, it worked well, but now it just registers everything as ""HI"". Going to try a different brand."
2,Vote with your feet,These probe thermometers are a great idea and we all want them to work but the fact is they really dont. I have a four year old Polder that has failed after about eight uses (Thanksgiving turkey and Christmas Eve prime rib). The problem seems to be with the probe jack on the body rather than the probe. Because of the poor reliability ratings I have babied it all its life by storing it in a remote cupboard in a Crown Royal bag. The low liftime is really unaceptable and we should protest by not buying them. I suggest everyone go back to a good instant read thermometer and send the manufacturers a message that the quality must improve.
1,Wish I had read the reviews !,Bought this without having done my research figuring that they were a respectable company. BAH - it pooped out after around four months Will not buy a product from this company again.
1,Meat thermometer,"I wanted a good meat thermometer for cooking and grilling. This is not the product for that purpose. It seems that it doesn't work for grilling because the thermocouple is poorly made and is destroyed from the heat. I used it once in a gas grill and now it is basically junk. A new thermocouple is expensive when shipping is included. This information is not available when purchasing, but it is in the directions after you receive it."
3,Excellent kitchen tool - wish the probe had lasted more than 13 months.,"This was a great tool. I've made the best roasts and hams ever since I started using it. No more opening the oven and trying to determine if the meat was done to the right degree. Unfortunately, the probe only lasted about 13 months - just out of warranty - after less than a dozen uses. So now it is useless and I am not sure I want to try this brand again."
1,Faulty Gadget,"After reading the other reviews, I have now realized that I too, have a faulty gadget. This past Thanksgiving I used it in my turkey. I couldn't understand why it was giving me a reading way out of wack for the time the turkey had been in the oven. At the time, I decided to just cook based on the recommended time table that came w/ the turkey because there was no way the meat was done, as the thermometer was indicating.Initially, it did work great.. I used to love it, but won't trust it again."
1,Do bot buy. LCD screen failed on 2 thermometers.,I bought 2 thermometers within the last 2 years.The LCD screen on the first one failed after about a year.I took the second one out from its package and put freshbatteries in it and it failed immediatelyeven though it was NEW taken from its original box!So now I have 2 thermometers thatI can't use because of broken LCD screens.I am never buying anything from POLDER ever again.
1,poor reliability,This unit was a great addition until the probe went bad after only a few months. Not recommended.
4,love this,"I asked my mom to get me a meat thermometer. I had only seen the ones you have to pull the roast out of the oven, stick in, wait for it to get to the temp as the roast loses it's heat, then put back in the oven. I thought that was the only way. Then she brought me this. Right away I said no thank you because I didn't like that you can only select the meat you have and it determines the temp. After I read the package more carefully, I saw that each meat has extra settings of rare, medium, well done which then adjusts the target temperature. I still wished that I could manually set in my own temperature but I don't have to wait for the alarm to beep. I'll watch the temp climb until I'm ready and then remove it. I made chicken today and it worked great. I love having it on the counter and it's magnetic so it sticks to the stove or fridge as long as I wont trip on the wire lol."
3,Fragile Porbes,"The Polder thermometer works as advertised and I would not live without one BUT..... The temperature probe is fragile! It CANNOT be washed or it will get water inside and fail. The probe is NOT dishwasher safe. The wire CANNOT be kinked or it will fail. To make matters worse, the probes are hard to get! Polder does not warrentee them and although they are available, there are few places that carry them.(this site is a good example) They also cost ($) plus shipping and handleing"
2,Great while it lasted,"Had my polder thermometer lasted longer than 6 months, I would have given it a 4 or 5 star rating.Having a probe with a cord is a great idea. It is very convenient for monitoring temperatures in ovens or smokers if you don't want to raise the lid. Combined with the temperature alert feature (you can set a temperature to set of the alarm), the polder is very handy. Unfortunately, having gone through two probes, it appears that they are too delicate for this kind of use. It is very easy to damage the cord and then you will get wildly off readings.My other criticism of the polder is the time that it takes to react to temperature changes and the length of time it takes to get an accurate reading. My Taylor instant read obtains a reading in a few seconds. The polder often takes much longer (15-20 seconds), which can be an issue when checking steaks on a very hot grill.In summary, don't buy this device unless you want to buying replacement probes frequently."
2,polder thermometer,"I bought this product around christmas last year. I am a professional chef. This product worked perfectly up until today. It has stopped reading temp. and just displays the words high temp.. I am trying to find out wear the company is but am having no luck. If it were still working I would rate this 5 stars. But what should I expect for 30 bucks, a lifetime? Thanks for listening, David McCreavy"
3,"Fabulous, but faulty!","A great idea -- a thermometer that stays in the meat while the oven door is closed! The main unit stays on the outside, with a magnet to keep it in place on the top of the stove. I absolutely loved this thing -- perfectly cooked meat every time. And then, one day, it just stopped working! How frustrating! And at it's price, it's just not worth buying a fragile thermometer to me. Oh, well. Give this a shot, or give it as a neat gift. Just don't be surprised when it breaks!"
2,"Great idea, breaks in 6-9 months","I've owned 3 of these and they are wonderful when they work. However, they don't work for long, averaging about 6 months for me which gets kind of expensive.I'm currently looking for a more reliable version of the same thing, these are just too disappointing."
2,Worked great while it worked...,"This thermometer worked very well, but suddenly started registering a minimum of 117 degrees at all times and could not be fixed. Considering that it was safely stored in its place when it happened is disturbing.I used this thermometer only about 10 times. For the price, I would have expected it to last longer.The idea is sound, it was extremely useful, but, not worth it for such a short life span. I never even used up the first battery.Back to Taylor thermometers for me."
1,Wast of time & Money,"I just recived this for X Mass, it is listed as a accessorie in the Weber grill catalog. Most of the reviews sayit was used for a couple of months befor it stoped working, this one never worked, just reads Hi Temp when the probe is pluged in and sounds the alarm.Called Weber an said I will be shiped a new one, I would like a good one.Don't waist your time or money.Thank YouD.M.G."
1,Great -- for as long as it lasted.,"I have very little to add that hasn't already been struck upon: slow read time, doesn't last much past the year, poor instruction booklet, faulty ""HI TEMP"" readings. Your better off with a better established brand."
2,On to number 3....,"This is a great product. My first one lasted almost 2 years. I dropped it and it broke the leads to the LCD display. Although it still worked, the temperatures were not fully displayed. So I bought another one. I used it on my grill for steaks. It worked great, then thanksgiving time came and I got the typical ""hi"" reading when the probe was plugged in and the ""lo"" reading when it was removed. Needless to say I went back to my old fashoned meat thermometer. Does anyone know if this is a probe issue? In any case, after reading the reviews, I see that this is typical. I would give this product five stars but Polder sould give a much bigger warning about grill compatability and work on reliability. As an engineer, I know the reliability issues can be fixed. If anyone knows if the hi/low issue is just the probe, let me know so I can buy a new probe.Eric"
1,Junk,"Probe stopped working during the fourth use. I was checking for a replacement probe when I read about others having the same problem. Well, now I'll just throw it away and get a traditional leave-in type. Sure, I may add a few minutes to my cooking time, but I think its better than using an inaccurate and problematic device. I could replace the probe, but how many of you have seen replacement blades for a Wusthof? Exactly."
1,Horrible Reliability,"I saw this thermometer being used on Food Network and I thought it would be really great. First, the pre-programmed temperatures in the thermometer are way too high - probably government recommended temps... Anyway, the first time I used the thermometer was on a prime rib - the calibration was definitely off by alot - I set it at 110 degrees to be on the safe side and the entire prime rib was medium well done when the thermometer beeped. Then, the second time I went to use this thermometer, the entire LCD Screen was messed up and unable to be read. Pretty Much a waste of money for this item. I still want a digital thermometer but from reviews I have been reading, its hard to find a good reliable thermometer."
3,Inaccurate,"While it seems easy enough to use and is still working, after several undercooked meals I had to test it. Testing against a known accurate thermometer this was ten degrees off. This makes a world of difference when cooking meats. Five degrees makes a world of difference. I could send it back to Polder for replacement, but it doesn't seem worth the shipping."
3,"Good, but no timer","I like this thermo device, I just wish it has a timer just for timing.I have used it for steak and chicken, although I find the steak overcooked using the preset choices. Great with chicken though."
1,Probes are worthless!,"I have ruined too many dishes to use this thermometer any longer. I loved it the first time I used it but on the third use it way overcooked my expensive cut of meat and dinner was destroyed. So I found that the probe had failed even after repeated attempts to contact polder to question its warranty had failed I just ordered 2 new probes from their website. One was defective when it arrived and the other only lasted for one use, save your money and either buy a cheap one at target or a quality instant read."
1,Polder Preprogrammed Thermometer never worked .,"The Polder Preprogrammed Thermometer is a great idea but it never worked for me. When I plug the probe into the body of the unit it immediately registers ""HI"" and within seconds begins beeping intermittently. This condition begins before inserting the probe into the food or oven. It never registers the internal temperature of the food.I would have reported to Polder, but I don't know how to contact them. I note the precise similarity of the Polder & Taylor thermometers appearances & Taylor's reported defect in another review on your site. Are they the same manufacturer?"
1,I've had four of these,"Great product but it lasts less than a year. I've became tired of sending it back so I bought another brand, it also broke in less than 12 months. I lost the recipt so I'm back for yet another. These are so convient that as long as you hold on to the reciept they are worth the hassle."
1,not very good,"When it worked it worked well. However, eight months into this -- and I only have used it maybe 6 or 8 times, it's broken. I have not done anything to it, and one day the the display is just messed up. I can see a line here and there, but nothing else. Replacing the battery did not help and Polder's website offers no information such as warranty information. It is defintely NOT worth $30."
2,Didn't last long,"I bought my Polder less than a year ago and thought it was the greatest. I was preparing meats on the grill and in the oven to perfection. Then...it quit. Just as other reviewers have noted, the probe went haywire and it is now useless. I've yet to decide if it is worth spending money on another probe (especially since others have had the same problem). I have to say I'm extremely disappointed with the quality of this product. If it were reliable, it would be fantastic."
3,"Nice material, but soaks through easily.","Received this as a gift. Nice design, and soft fabric, but it's on the thin side, so spit up/drool leaks through and gets on baby's clothes easily."
4,quality varies,"The quality of the book is varied as the quality of the articles included varies. Some of the scholars have clear biases they are operating from in their research, most are not up front about such bias. Rawson has however, collected some of the leading scholars in the field into one place thus providing the reader with a good range of views and topics. A good book for a class on the ancient family."
4,Very good book - wish it was my text for class,"Have not had a chance to read cover to cover yet, but it looks very well written and organized so far, so that any normal person can absorb and understand. Wish this was the required text for my class. No doubt it will probably fill in the gaps that my real text missed, since this book seems more grounded in reality, than textbook theory. It may not help me on the test, thought I'm sure it will; but I'm sure it will help me in real life."
2,Not good for krav maga,"I bought these to use in krav maga sparring. I'd never sparred before so I didn't know what I really needed (hadn't seen anyone wearing shin guards either). So I grabbed these ones because they were the cheapest ones I could find. I got some funny looks the first day I used them, and of course they didn't hold up well when sparring. They slide all over on your shin and the cushion is just not enough to cushion a blocked kick etc. They also didn't wrap around the sides of my legs very well.I'm sure these would be useful for something else, but they're not practical for krav."
1,Not very good.,"Poor graphics, poor sound and doesn't run very well with OSX 10.3 Panther. Very disappointing."
2,a weak effort by The Talented Ms. Highsmith,"Patricia (""The Talented Mr. Ripley"") Highsmith has written many wonderful psychological thrillers. After having enjoyed many of these I had high expectations of 'A Game for the Living'. Sadly, I was disappointed.Unlike Highsmith's successful formula of writing tense thrillers about accused murders undergoing extreme apprehension about being caught, 'A Game for the Living' is a simple whodunnit-type murder mystery. It involves the murder of a ""loose"" young Mexican woman, and the friendship of her two lovers as they try to locate the killer. I found the story to be banal, with no suspense build up. It is hard to imagine this book was written by Highsmith.Bottom line: skip this book, buy one of Highsmith's (much) better works such as 'The Blunderer', 'Strangers on a Train', and 'This Sweet Sickness' (..to name a few)."
1,Fusion software is horrible. Better to just buy an add-on drive.,"The Fusion installation CD didn't detect the drive until I turned off my Windows Firewall. Of course, this wasn't mentioned anywhere in the setup guide. Don't try to load a directory with more than a few high resolution (5 megapixel or more) photos, or it will take FOREVER to generate the thumbnails. The drag-and-drop popup Java applet file import is very slow to import (even over Gigabit ethernet), and dropping a folder into it doesn't create the folder with the files underneath it; instead, it just puts all the files into the root directory. VERY DISAPPOINTED in what had the potential to be a useful product. If you have 1-2 Megapixel photos or small documents, in just a few small directories, maybe this will work for you, but for $700? You can do better."
1,Seagate Defective Products,"I will never buy a Seagate product again.The software is horrific. Once everything was setup, the drive failed out losing all the data that was copied over.I have nothing nice to say about this company(Seagate) and Philips.Both seem to rip off consumers regularly."
5,This book saved my life.,"The comment above is not made lightly- I was a drunk for 25 years and made several attempts to quit, but could never understand why AA didn't work for me. Everything I ever read on alcoholism was AA oriented, and I thought the only way to quit was to spend the rest of my life in smoky church basements telling my problems to strangers. This book was the voice I'd been looking for, that let me know that there were other ways to think about alcoholism. I don't mean to knock AA because it has helped so many people. But it just didn't work for me. Reading this book was like turning a light on my Beast within. If you want to stop drinking and get control of your life, please try this book. It worked for me."
2,Superseded,"Like the person from Anchorage implies, The Small Book has been superseded by Trimpey's book, ""Rational Recovery..."" Trimpey has disavowed The Small Book, because he added new concepts and abandoned others (e.g., the Rational Recovery system no longer has support groups). In fact, Trimpey states on his website that he wishes he could pull The Small Book from publication, but he is powerless to do so. Buy the Rational Recovery book instead."
3,a little short,"The item was just what I expected, and easy to attached to the plaster wall, and looks and works great.The one problem is that the total length was about 4"" too short!"
4,limited mounting options,"The strip comes with a single plastic clip you screw to the wall, after which you push the strip in to this clip. It also includes a couple of very short pieces of double-sided tape.It didn't feel that secure when mounted. I ended up adding some 3M vehicle molding tape in place of the small pieces of double sided tape."
4,Buy more adhesive strip,"Comes with two clips and some pieces of double adhesive foam tape. I wanted it to really be substantive when I stuck it on a painted cinder block wall. I bought some more double face foam tape. It looks good, and holds my posters well"
3,"Not fantastic, even for diet stuff","The taste of this stuff just isn't very good. It resembles tomato sauce to some extent, but not enough to distract from the fact that this stuff is really weird. Also, it smells a little bad. The shells and cheese are better, I think, though these are certainly convenient and not inedible."
3,This book is difficult to follow.,"I had a great deal of trouble concentrating on this book. As wonderful as the subject is, the writer's style leaves much to be desired. The chapters overlap, so one feels there is a lot of repetition. Also, too many other authors are quoted, which belabors the point being made. I admit that I didn't finish the book -- it just didn't inspire me."
1,Disappointed,"I received my CD in good condition and in a fair amount of time. However, I was very disappointed to find that the CD was a promotional CD which only included one song and ""snippets"" of five other songs off of the complete album.I feel that the seller wasn't completely forthcoming in describing the item. If you're going to order something from this seller be sure you know what your buying before you pay your hard earned money."
2,Guess who Loves you,"If your just wanting the one song Guess who loves you then its cool!! but the rest of the cd really sucks!! I'm very glad it was priced really cheap cause the cd is horrible, no wonder he never made another one ."
5,Fantastic Novel!,"I loved this book. I honestly don't think it matters if it's true or not, so why bash the author for any preface he may have included. We read for entertainment, and man, was I entertained! For someone who has no personal knowledge of the military, and some serious big brother conspiracy therory complexes, this was a perfect book for me. It was fast paced, action packed, and held just the right amount of a twist at the end. Thank you, Trent, for writing such a enjoyable novel."
3,Not quite as good as the other four Monster singles,"First off, know that all the singles from Monster have b-sides that are live recordings. The idea is to be able to combine all the b-sides from the five singles and have one concert recording (though they are from a few different sources). Now, the reason that this single only gets three stars is that while the three b-side songs are good, how many versions of Everybody Hurts and Man on the Moon do we really need? With a catalogue of so many great songs that are never heard, a choice few ""big hits"" get rehashed again and again. I don't mind, but wouldn't it be great to get some slightly more obscure songs on a single than the radio hits? Oh well, its still very worthwhile and the version of Monty Got a Raw Deal is good too."
3,poor warranty / customer service,"Scanpan Classic 12-1/2-Inch Fry PanI have used scanpans for several years, after awhile the handles come loose, it bubbles, wont release etc. The first time I returned the pan to the factory, they did send me new one. When that handle became loose, the factory sent me an obvious second. The pan was so far out of round it was almost egg shaped. Not good. I havent purchased any scanpan products since. I've had the best luck with swiss diamond. By the way, I do take very good care of my cookware, including copper and all-clad. I would caution against spending the money on scanpan, particularely if you expect them to honor their warranty."
2,poor quality,The pan is so not a non-stick. I paid $100 for this pan and there is no easy way to return it. amazon can you please help?
2,Try finding a place to return it.,We have had two of these skillets in 6 years. Both over time have gradually developed a brown skim on the cooking surface and become no longer non-stick. We returned the first one and now our second has done the same thing. We have followed the manufacturer's instructions (no cooking on high heat and no dry cooking). And in the last two years we've never found a store that carries this item to replace it.
2,My fry pan has completely lost the nonstick-ness after 2 1/2 years!,"Well, I did not check the reviews on this cookware before I bought it. I was impressed with the advertising and I bought THE ENTIRE COLLECTION! The saucepans have a few nicks, nothing that bad, but the fry pans did not last past the 2 years. Each fry pan has lost it's nonstick quality. I can still see it around the upper rim, but the inside surface of each pan is bald! Now it looks like any other pan that food ""sticks"" to.At the price I paid, I feel like I was taken to the cleaners!"
3,"Save some money, and just get cast iron","I bought the 12"" Scanpan fry pan a number of years ago. As with all miraculous, new-technology ""non-stick"" pans, this one will eventually break your heart. Over time, its non-stickiness becomes a memory, and you're left with a decent, very heavy, evenly-cooking pan. With that your fate, why pay all that cash?I've reached a point in my life where I understand that, yes, you need a few non-stick pans in the kitchen and, verily, all non-stick pans have a finite life. I've accepted that. I buy a clutch of reasonably-priced non-stick pans (I'm partial to the Meyer line), use them until they die, and replace them. A more permanent solution is cast iron. They need a bit more TLC to keep them properly seasoned but, hey, they work forever."
3,No Stick Wonder,"I have owned the 10"" pan for over 5 years. I has lost it's appeal, but I loved it for the first 4. I got this one as a gift for someone to add to their collection. If you take really good care of it you will love it. No dish washer, no over scrubbing, and don't douse in cold water right off the stove."
1,Don't know how anyone could write a good review on this pan,"I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of this pan... after one use it has scratches all over it... every titantum pan I read about.. that was the main thing,... you couldn't scratch it...if I buy one of these again it will be a high quailty one... as this was made in Denmark.. I thought it was a good pan.. sorely disappointed."
2,More expense than worth,"The unit I received was a used unit even though I paid for a new unit.The infrared lens has a crack in it, most likely why the unit was returned in the first place. It's not really a show stopper, once you get used to it being there.What goggle upgrade? Never received that.Meade makes a much better product and is less costly.Good news is that shipping was very fast."
5,Six Stars!!!,"I can't believe any self-respecting jazz aficionado would give this album anything less than a 5 star rating.Paquito is simply THE reigning master of Latin / Cuban jazz and this is one of his finest efforts.Paquito is lyrical beyond imagination and his inspiring, melodical themes are unmatched in any style of music.As if that weren't enough, the percussion and rhythm sections on this album are phenomenal. The jam / groove arrangements are intoxicatingly exuberant.This album is Afro-Cuban rhythms and Latin jazz at its pinnacle.Paquito's classical polish brings a degree of sophistication and elegance that puts him in a class of his own.This CD is and always will be on the top shelf of my collection. It is timeless perfection.Chris RuelInstrumental Music ReviewsChrisRuel.com"
3,If I Only Had A Brain,"If you were a big Beavis & Butthead fan back in the day, you *might* remember seeing the boys rock out to the bass line. Funny stuff!Sadly, YouTube recently yanked the music video (VERY FUNNY!!) due to copyright violations yadda yadda yadda... BUT you can find the song itself on YouTube. Some enterprising lad set up his camcorder pointed at his turntable, and posted the video of the song playing. Give It A Play!! It might make you want to go out and buy the CD!More sadly, this song isn't for sale yet on iTunes as of January 1st, 2009."
2,High Hopes then Disappointment,"We were very excited to assemble and play w/this classic toy; Our 6 year-old-son has discovered Nascar. Unfortunately, the guard rails did not stay on and the pieces did not snap together easily.Once assembled one track worked very well - the car went so fast it flew off the track ! The other track worked inconsistently then not at all.If this toy did work it would be great fun !"
2,Fun while it lasted,"This Life-Like slot car set was easy to set up, and a blast to play with at first. However, after about two days of use the car would no longer run reliably. I tried cleaning the contact pads, replacing the contact pads, cleaning the track, etc. Each attempt worked for a very brief period, and then the problems came back. The set eventually had to be returned.A slot car set for the kids should not have to be this much work!"
3,Beware!,This is a reprint of an earliar edition with a different painting on the cover. The book info seen on line does not disclose this fact. Therefore if you are an online buyer you may be fooled into buying a book on Monet that you already have.
5,track list for the buyer,track list of the single:Hungah (Supa Hungah)6:34Hungah (Justify My Hungah)8:29Hungah (Supa Hungah Dub)7:06Hungah (The Way You Hungah)4:05Hungah (Facts of Hungah)4:09Hungah (Album Version)4:27
5,Great Kids Music and I like it too,"My grandkids LOVE Elizabeth Mitchell. Usually I have to ""suffer"" through the kids songs that are popular today but I even listen to this when the kids are not around."
5,Best Baby CD,"I searched high and low for a voice a liked singing popular baby/children's songs... and this is it! Wonderful, soothing voice, but songs vary from peppy to lullaby-ish. Perfect for a little baby."
5,Wonderful gift!,This is my all-time favorite baby gift! The songs bring back memories for all of us no matter what age. My kids are grade-schoolers and still love singing along.
5,Great for parents too!,I enjoy listening to these songs as much as my 3 year old son! I searched hard to find music that appealed to a 3 year old and was tolerable to adults. Most kids music is just not cool! These songs are cute without being overly juvenile and the accompanying instrumentation is very pleasing to listen to. The songs are easy enough for my son to sing along with and we love the folk music vibe. Another excellent Mitchell album is Catch the Moon with Lisa Loeb. We love this one too and have given both as gifts.
5,fun and folksy for kids,"We bought this album and You Are My Flower at the same time, and we love both albums. Elizabeth Mitchell has a wonderful voice, and there is an eclectic quality in song choices and arrangements to keep the listener interested. My kids love hearing the kids on the background of the songs, too."
1,Not Thrilled,"The selection of songs is o.k., but it's hard to understand the words. It would help if the lyrics were included, but they are not. Consider spending your money on one of the other wonderful recordings for children that are available, for example, Sing Along with Putumayo. The quality of this recording is unbelievably better than You are My Sunshine and it comes with lyrics."
2,OK if you are going to buy a HDTV,This book is OK if you are going to buy a HDTV but useless if you are a technician and need an understanding on repairing a HDTV.
2,Could use a major revision,It was obsolete when first printed. The technology is moving so fast that many of today's technologies are not mentioned. I would eliminate all analog television since it is no longer available. I would love to see a revised issue.
3,Cute story,"It is a cute story through an imaginative child's eyes that attempts to answer the question of what do teacher's do after the kid's all leave. This can easily be used to introduce a writing prompt, ""Mrs./Mr. (Fill in the Blank)'s Secret Life"". The story is a bit more ""childish"" than I expected for my 5th grade classroom, but I still think it will be a great hook to get them ready for their next writing assignment. :)"
1,Author fails to provide evidence for his claims,"The author has tried to shed light on a great story but has failed to provide evidence for his claims. Though I do not doubt the performance of some of the IRIAF units in 1980s, it is not enough for the author to just state stories/gossip as fact. Can not recommend this book if you're seriously curious about F-14 combat stuff with the Iranians."
1,La Juive,"This recording has poor sound quality and sounds like an ""open mic"" recording, complete with un-edited applause that interrupt the music every few minutes throughout the entire opera. Avoid this one!"
5,Fabulous!!!,"When I ordered this ring, it was not what I expected. Even better. I am very pleased with the way it looks and I love the style. I get more compliments on this ring than my actual wedding ring."
5,Natrol looks to be a good company,"I did a bit of research on various companies selling Pycnogenol and found that only Natrol has an ""A"" rating with the Better Business Bureau. That tells me that they take care of their customers and don't put out products that draw a huge number of complaints. For that reason, I'm going to give their product a try over their competitors."
3,just started taking these,I am looking forward to great results as i saw on the Dr Oz show to look 7 years younger..............
1,Diary of an anorexic?,Great book to send you off the deep end with your healthy eating habits.In no time you will be craving KFC cos you got so hungry trying to be a breatharian all your ethics have gone out the window.Good read to see how gullible people are though.My house mate died trying this out. 2009. 30 year raw foodist.No such thing as breatharians people. Move on.
4,Decent pan,"Ok pan, gets the job done. Kind of thin, I've only used it once so far but I would be concerned that it would fall apart in the future. For the time being I have no complaints."
4,52 minutes of humor and politically driven punk rock mayhem,"52 minutes of humor and politically driven punk rock mayhem. The untouched production makes the listener believe they are truly part of the show. As an added bonus, the group performs a band new song (""Americans Abroad"" - how appropriate) and includes a video of their performance of ""Problems"""
3,Kind of disappointing,"I haven't seen them live but anyone who has seen the DVD, ""We're Never Going Home"", would agree that this sounds far different. Tom never sang the whole way through a song on the DVD, often taking breaks and passing the mic around for fans to sing. I would rather get what their live show is really like because I don't think this is it. Although I am a fan of Americans Abroad, the song."
1,"slow, boring...","i love against me but this live record isnt very good. crowd is almost inexistant, songs are slower than the originals and the band seem bored. ive seen them and they are defintly better than this live"
4,Blown Away,"I saw this band as an opening act for the Indigo Girls in Raleigh, NC. If you enjoy their CD, you really should catch their act live! Incredible energy is the only way I can describe it! Their performance on-stage was enough to prompt me to purchase their CD. This band will go far!"
3,mistitled book,"A more appropriate title for this book, would be, to call it, ""Yoruba Chiefs,"" since the contents are mainly related to the incarnated state of chietaincy among the Yoruba ethnic group of Nigeria from anthropological and historical perspectives. It is on the whole a well-written and informative study. The given title is, however, misleading. The practical reason for a study to be given a wrong title is to invest it with a wider appeal. While title padding is sorely needed by many books, a work of this stature isn't one of them. In this instance, ironically, the result of title misfit is the obverse of the intended purpose."
3,It's has some useful info,"I personally didn't find it too useful because I think any average person already knows half of the information in that book. He didn't list any names of agents or photograghers, etc. in his book, but I guess there were good points. He was very honest and up front, telling the readers what to expect and what agents and producers are looking for in an actor/actress. He talked about the different types of actors, like screen actors, stage actors, and extras, but didn't go into a great detail about anything in particular. Overall, I'd say it's an okay beginning book, but I would actually recommmend Acting is Everything, 9th edition over Acting Professionally because it is much more thorough, helpful and informative."
1,Son of the Beach Let Down,"Why was this released? All these episodes are already on DVD! Now I have to send the product back, what a waste! I am very dissapointed!"
5,extremely helpful for a caregiver,"I already have a beautiful outdoor handmade ramp. However I have 2 2"" thresholds into the house and another 8"" step from den into kitchen. I am a caregiver and when my sister has difficulty walking I need to use the wheelchair in the house. This ramp makes things so much easier for both she & I. It is so easy to use and not too heavy. I can fold it up & stand it in the breezeway on days when I do not need it. It has helped my back tremondously!!I looked at several websites- found the EXACT same ramp elsewhere- much more expensive.Best thing I ever did for myself"
2,I expected better quality,"These are ok...they look great, but the lining by the heel of my left boot always gets wadded up making it difficult to get the boot on. I have other Frye boots that I love and haven't had any trouble with. I'm wouldn't buy these again."
1,Beware CCM Executive Leather Case,This case is useless. It does not close shut. It is too tight for my new Motorola v600.
2,A real disappointment,"This bra was purchased with the idea it would be uplifting. Instead I found my 38C hitting my midriff bulge. Not a happy experience. I have put this item away for emergencies only. If you are flat and lean, I am sure you will like it."
3,not as pictured,It's a nice item but it didn't look like the pic. the words seemed thick and were painted outside the line.
3,Disappointing Chain Quality,"I really liked the actual pendants for this necklace, but was disappointed with the quality of the chain...they looked almost plastic, which cheapens the whole gift."
2,Mask,"I got this mask for halloween, but I never got a chance to wear it. Also it doesn't really look like Darth Maul. And very hard to see out of it."
3,Made in China,"Okay, in the past month I've updated my shoe collection with the following brands:Giorgio Brutini (China), Kenneth Cole (Romania)(2 pair), Bostonian (Italy), Bacco Bucci (Italy)(2 pair), Mezlan (Italy), and Dr. Martins (England). These come in dead last. I give them a 3 because I will admit that the design of this shoe is suited to my style. Also, in my experience, they fit quite large (I ordered 11.5 in these and they're larger & looser than my size 12 Bacco Bucci and my size 12 Bostonians). In summation, if you are trying to decide between these shoes and a pair made in Italy, go for the Italian."
2,"Nice look from a distance, but cheap build quality","The shoes look nice from a distance, but the quality is pretty low.Cheap leather (if that's even leather)."
1,Several Seconds Wasted,"So I ordered this cd without having heard anything else by The Plain White T's other than 'Hey There Delilah', and to be honest with you, I wish I'd just bought that track on iTunes and saved myself a few quid (not to mention the time spent listening).What you get here is nothing like the smash hit single 'Delilah'. No, all 'Every Second Counts' offers is kind of what you'd expect if you mixed 'Jimmy Eat World' with 'Fall Out Boy', and then made it even whinier! I'd just like to point out that I love Jimmy Eat World and have a fondness for Fall Out Boy on occasion, so for me to dislike this cd, is a surprise. I just can't get past the ridiculous lyrics (e.g. hate is a strong word, but I really really really don't like you) and extreme whining.Gah! Just put the cd in and program it to repeat 'Hey There Delilah', which incidentally is a bonus track - hmmm"
3,Nothing new,"This cd is pretty average. They aren't doing anything original with this album. I feel like I've heard all these songs before with other bands/music (it reminds me a lot of the older Vertical Horizon and The Calling stuff). The songs are enjoyable for a few plays, but they are also easily forgettable. It's the complete middle of the road - not exactly bad but not really great either. I don't find anything special or spectacular here."
3,A Little Too Alternative for Me.,"One Thing is the reason I bought this CD, and I just have not warmed to the other cuts on this CD. I intend to continue to give it a chance though. I have it in my regular CD rotation in my car."
4,"Originally written before ""Hey Delilah"" went big...","For their major label debut, the Plain White T's deliver an album loaded with catchy hooks, relatable lyrics, and smooth rock melodies. Forget all of those trendy bands of the week; Plain White T's are the real deal with their simple and tried and true formula. I hope these guys get the chance to thrive."
2,One hit wonder,One hit wonder. Their hit was different than the other sides on the album. The one song that they were nominated for song of the year was a great one. Makes me wish there were still 45's.
1,delilah drives me nuts,If I hear Hey There Delilah I want to slit my wrists - both ways because I can't remember which way is harder for the EMTs to stitch up. Whiny and annoying. Why do people like this?
1,Awful,"I got a copy of this CD for free and wondered why nobody I knew ever talked about this band. It seemed like a cool band name. I now understand why they never came up. This is some of the most horrible music I've heard in years. Overproduced, underthought, gimmicky, sales-pitch, mindless junk. Absolutely disgusting. However, if you like buying what MTV tells you is cool, by all means, enjoy."
2,Umm...,The music is decent... but the DVD made me question the sexuality of every single member of this band... and the singer has a huge nose.
4,Backwards to the future,"As a old (58) latecomer to the PWT's fanbase, I thought it would be fun to go back and check out their earlier music. I enjoyed hearing how they have progressed both as a band and as songwriters. I appreciate how they continue to cover new ground and expand their horizons, musically speaking. My 14 year old daughter and I enjoy listening to this cd together. I have to spoon feed her the newer stuff. But I think in time, she'll come around."
1,Great but cheaper elsewhere,"This is adorable and all you'd expect from a Fisher Price Little People toy. It's a fun hands-on christmas toy and decoration. However, I'll second the other review...it's currenly $19.99 at Toys r Us!"
3,"Good information, but dry","This is the only book I have found that gets into the details of why Civil War battles were fought the way they were. I always thought it seemed ridiculous that two armies would march in a line and just maul each other, but this book explains the logic and evolution of these tactics. Also, other Civil War books frustrated me because they just assume you know all the little details about small arms, artillery, and field works. This book just doesn't tell you about what they are, but how they were developed over time.Unfortunately, I have to agree with another reviewer--the book is very dry because Nosworthy seems to repeat the same information over and over again. For example, he explains the Civil War rifled musket shortcoming of low muzzle velocity over and over again in the book, as if we had not read the previous chapters. It is a shame it so dry, because I think more books like this are needed."
2,Very poor quality -- I returned it,"This reprint is the poorest quality I've purchased in years. The font looks like an old typewriter manuscript, and the print is quite faint and hard to read. I would have given it one star except for the fact that all the text was presumably included and this title by Oppenheim is hard to find. But I'd rather search for a better copy, even it costs a bit more. I returned it for a refund."
5,A musical jewel of thousand carats!,"Time is now is like a delightful summer breeze, a refreshing album that recreates with absolute freedom some of the most excel and refined Latin American and classic repertoire.Mario Bauzá made it possible with that characteristic sound, filled of Latin flavour and vigorous radiance that will captivate you from the first track.You won't believe the mesmerizing adaptation of Mack the knife, for instance. Don't let this album pass in front of you. Go for it and enjoy it forever."
3,"Impressive compilation of essays on the ""Goldhagen Debate.""","This book collects some thirty essays and other materials on Daniel Goldhagen's controversial 1996 book, ""Hitler's Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust."" Not every piece the reader might want to find is included here, but more than enough is presented to familiarize the reader with the chief objections to Goldhagen's theses raised by scholars and journalists, as well as the lines of defense offered by his supporters and Goldhagen himself. Although inherently somewhat repetitive, this book would prove rewarding to anyone interested enough in this arcane realm of Holocaust studies to be reading this review."
3,Unwilling Executioners,I found this book a useful counter-balance to the Goldhagen book.Goldhagen makes the point that eliminationist anti-Semitism was ingrained in German culture. Yet pardoxically credits the Germans as having over-come this recently. If it was such a part of German culture it seems incredible that it was over-come so rapidly. This book does an excellent job of putting the Goldhagen thesis in proper perspective.
1,No one knew anything. It was everyone else's fault.,"Waste of paper. Same old GERMAN denials. (Anyone familiar with the same kind of lies the SWISS have been caught at lately?) No one knew anything. They were forced. No one could oppose the STATE. GOLDHAGEN's book, together with the latest 'touring' exhibit of photo's of ordinary GERMANs doing the rounding up, killing etc show more truth that this book ever could. This generation of GERMANS are seeing the reality of situation.25% of the SS were ROMAN CATHOLICS. Who forced them to become SS murderers? Did they suddenly lose EVERY choice?"
1,Mini roboraptor,I purchased this toy for an 8 year old. The toy does not really do enough to hold the interest of a child this age. It walks very slowly. My child does not play with it. It might be appropriate for or hold the interest of a much younger child.
4,Review of Wizard's Convention 2,"Good songs by great performers. A nice collection of songs by all-time stars such as Mike d'Abo, Chris Farlowe, Tony Ashton, John Lawton or Denny Laine. Not forgetting Eddie Hardim himself"
4,New favorite,Heard about MacDonald for years and finally read one of his books. I will be reading a lot more of him. Travis McGee is a memorable character.
4,A new Travis McGee fan?,"I recently overheard someone saying how much they enjoyed the Travis McGee books so I searched out the first-in-the-series at my local library. The copy I ended up reading was about the most worn out, dog-eared, common pocket book you can imagine. Some how it was quit fitting. The Travis McGee character is unique and appealing to probably both men and women readers. Kind of a Han Solo guy but wiser and more mellow. The author's writing style is more inventive and engaging than typical; the pace varies from silky-smooth to rapid Rainman word association. Creative with word combinations. Maybe not always grammatically correct (?) but the intended feeling and description shines through every paragraph. Interesting plot. A unique villain easy to despise... you can't wait for him to get his comeuppance. You'll have to read it to see how it unfolds."
4,The first of the McGees!,"Even though I still find ""Flash of Green"" to be my favorite MacDonald book, there's something so appealing about the Travis McGee series that keeps me coming back to them. But ""The Deep Blue Good-By"" just doesn't have that quick pace that some of the others have, maybe because it was the first time he was introduced to the reading public. And the minor characters just are not as interesting. This is all a presonal reaction, so don't take it too seriously. I just hope that MacDonald continues to gain in popularity, as I feel he is horribly overlooked."
4,"Clever, but a tad misogynistic","John D. MacDonald has a tremendous sense of style, a keep eye, and a catchy turn of phrase. Read this story with a highlighter in hand to mark off the brilliant lines because they are wonderful.He has some misogynistic tendencies -- females in his books are weak creatures to be rescued with no common sense and easy to render compliant and stupid via excessive sex, a phenominon males are immune to. That may be a product of when he was writing. The story is worth reading despite that.Overall, an engaging work, a clever story, and a delightful light read."
3,Good writing - not so good material,"While the writing was excellent, the material lacked interest for me. For a thriller/action/mystery there was very little sleuthing and very little action. Three-quarters of the book dealt with seven broken women coming to Travis McGee for a word of philosophy and sexual healing. This was a treatise on women's self worth, as explained through the cavalier Jimmy-Buffet lenses of Travis McGee."
5,A Master of Suspense creates a hero for the ages,"Sit back and relax. Start at page 1 and take the ride of your life with Travis McGee. This first book in the series is an excellent starting point for first-timers because all the ingredients for the McGee stories are here-a lady in distress, a stolen ""treasure"", and a brutal unrelenting villain. MacDonald had a talent for involving you so deeply that you find yourself going back to re-read passages that hit you hard the first time. Junior Allen is a perfect villain--A force of nature motivated by greed with an ever-deepening bent towards sexual brutality. This book contains storytelling so vivid that you feel the punches with McGee. This book, along with Donald Hamilton's Death of a Citizen, is the perfect example of the 50s-60s Fawcett Originals."
5,What a great book and character!,"I was a little suspicious of this, being that it was written in the sixties, and I'm not such a big fan of that period, but MacDonald's writing is timeless. I am now a huge Travis McGee fan. He writes very well, and gives just enough character development to keep you interested without going overboard. He also carves a mean plot line with lots of twists and turns.Take a chance on this one...you'll be like me...aching to read the rest of the McGee series."
5,Promo Vinyl Tracklisting,"Side One:1. O.G. Extended Mix (4:13)2. Old II Da New Mix (4:11)Side Two:1. O.G. Instrumental (4:10)2. Album Version* (5:32)*from the album ""The Homegirl""1994 Giant Records"
1,a flop,"I purchased these videos when my infant daughter was abouttwo-months old, and she had just begun to respond favorably to otherinfant-stimulation videos. The unsophisticated computer animation and graphics failed to engage her attention for even 30 seconds. A total flop and waste of money."
1,"Disappointing, to say the least!!!","This is the stupedest Arthur, the most arrogantly ignorant hero, the worst character a writer can create. What a jerk! This coming from the #1 Arthurian fan . . .What a pity this book was reprinted and I wasted my time reading it. And worst still. Others will read it. Awful."
1,Shining Image Shipped the Wrong Item,"They shipped the wrong item and it appears the only thing I can do about it is to ship it back to them for replacement. There doesn't seem to be any way to contact them. And, it looks like it will cost me to correct their mistake: it doesn't look like they will refund what it will cost me to ship the item back to them for replacement. I'll probably just keep what they sent me (it's similar although it's last year's model and the one I ordered was supposed to be ""new and improved""). That's probably what they were counting on. I can't say how the actual item works because I haven't tried it yet."
2,False Advertising,This is not the Cosmic Collisions program shown at the Museum of Natural History's Planetarium. I should have believed the prior reviewer. The narrator for this DVD is not Robert Redford. I was going to return it but my kids liked the program. Graphics are OK.
1,Bait and switch,"The dvd ""Cosmic Collisions"" Amazon is advertising is not the same one they are delivering. They are advertising the Robert Redford 30-minute film being shown in planetariums around the world; they are sending out a 2-hour Discovery Channel program with the same name."
2,Mindless is what Mindless Does,The book has a number of spelling and grammatical mistakes that even a simple word processor could have caught. The information is rehashed and nothing revelating even for someone who has been in sales for less than a year. It is hard to believe that Kurlin is even in the selling business. His thoughts are disjuncted and have no clear direction. I can not imagine that a customer would accept this type of shoddy work.
5,Sensational Product,"I owned one of these for almost 20 years until it's demise. The salt corroded the mechanism on the top chamber, but I notice that the new model is designed to overcome that fault. My family joked with me because I missed it so much.So much less clutter on the table, looks good AND, a brilliant pepper grinder! When I finally replaced the original one, I couldn't be happier."
1,This game is mediocre at its best,"This is an arcade futuristic jet warfare game for the PS2. The controls are simple and the game is extremely easy. I beat this game in a night and never played it again, there is no replay value. It is suitable for little kids or older folks who might not play many games. If you know the Ace Combat series and you like games like that, you will find this one a waste of time."
2,Lame Game,"It took a very long time for my son to get used to controlling the ship. It's very hard to fly (very sensitive) and though the terrain looks pretty cool, this game plays very poorly."
1,Too hard for a 10 year old,"This game is too hard for a 10 year old, which must be why the rating was changed from 10+ to 12+. You get unlimited weapons, but one of the planes is almost impossible to shoot down. It should probably be rated Teen."
4,I May Be A Liberal,"And smoked too much pot and that's why I didn't get that the musicality on this cd was such a hot button issue. Okay, his voice isn't doesn't have that much range, but he sings mostly in key and works within his limitations. The song writing is consise and pictorial. It does occassionally wallow in sentamentalism (for example, The Badge of Courage), however songs like I'm A Lucky One and Siagon should be acerbic enough for anyone. This cd is a concept album and most of them have a few songs that were written to round out the song count. And looking at it as a concept album, it works along side most other concept albums. It has the serious and maudlin moments, the lighter moments and everything in between. And, I will lay odds that even non military personel can relate to the song Garrett Trooper.PS: As to the title: Yes I am a liberal. No, I don't smoke pot anymore. Much."
5,"Duty , Honor , Country","I'VE LOVED THE SONG "" BALLADS OF THE GREEN BERETS "" SINCE MY MOTHER BOUGHT THE ALBUM WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT.EVEN THOUGH I WAS ONLY SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS OLD AT THE TIME,IT TOUCHED ME DEEPLY.WHEN I WAS OLDER I DISCOVERED THAT THERE WERE WAS MORE THAN ONE SONG INGRAINED INTO THAT VINYL.THE REST OF BARRY'S MUSIC GRIPPED ME JUST AS STRONGLY.WITH NEWS OF THE VIETNAM WAR ON THE EVENING NEWS EVERY NIGHT,THESE SONGS REALLY HIT HOME.THE LYRICAL CONTENT HAS MEANING THAT I DIDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND AT THE TIME,BUT I SURE DO NOW.(GETTING OLDER DOES HAVE SOME BENEFITS,I.E.,MATURITY IF YOU'RE LUCKY)THE PATRIOTISM IN THIS ALBUM DOESN'T GRAB YOU BY THE THROAT,IT SURROUNDS YOUR HEART AND STAYS THERE.OBVIOUSLY,THIS ALBUM IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES OF ALL TIME.IF YOU ARE PART OF THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T DISCOVERED IT YET,YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF TO LISTEN TO IT.FEEL WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN MISSING ALL THESE YEARS.THIS MUSIC SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.ENJOY IT."
4,Good retrospective of his work,"It was good to hear SSgt Barry Sadler with some of those awful songs of the Vietnam war being brought back to life again. For me, who detested ""Ballad of the Green Berets"" when it was first released have come to enjoy the lyrics of the song. The whole album even though it does not seem to contain all of the songs of the original album is a darn sight better recorded than the single of ""Green Berets"""
5,A must have CD,"For baby boomers, this will bring back some strong memories of the 60's. My older brother bought this record, and played it until it wore out. Our father was in Vietnam at the time, so the songs had a special meaning to us. Although ""Ballad of the Green Berets"" is probably the most popular song, as a father, i found ""Lullaby"" the most touching."
4,American Pride,"Over the years, Ssgt Barry Sadler music has become a piece of American history. Most notable his trademark song ""Ballads of the Green Beret"" appears on the cd but it is the other hidden gems that make this cd worth buy. Songs like ""Garet Trooper"", ""The Solider Has Come Home"" and ""Badge of Courage"" proves that the patriotism which Ssgt Barry Sadler did in these songs still stands the hands of time.The only minor flaw in the cd maybe the stereo mix with has the music slightly louder than the vocals. They should of have used the mono mix instead. But this cd is worth getting for your collection just for ""Ballads of the Green Beret""."
1,Poor Quality,The item was not as advertized (Good Condition). It would not go to some tracks and skipped tracks. Gary Dennis
5,I love this toy!,"This toy is really fun. My favorite attachment is the voice scrambler. My ten-year-old sister likes to use the Micro Listener. My eleven-year-old sister likes the Voice Scrambler, too. You should get this toy."
4,Let the SPYING begin,My 8 yr old son got this for a gift and he just loves it - he plays and plays with it with his 11 yr old brother. Very cute and worth the money!
2,Read the Description Carefully!,"Read the ""Product Features"" before you decide on buying this toy. Contrary to Amazon's photo and what's stated in other reviews, this toy does not include the voice scrambler (which was the item that swayed me to buy this damn thing). Instead, it has a ""Secret Agent Pen."""
5,the ultimate spy kit,this item is probably the best spy kit ever.i really like how the voice scrambler works.the listerer is a bit rocky.74.23 % of the thing is background noises.everything else is fine though.this deserves the ratings i gave it
5,Cool!,"Very cool for young boys. Includes a motion detector, invisible ink pen and other ""spy gear."" Great for boys and girls, even adults will want to play with it!"
1,pretty much sucked!,"My son loves spy gear, but this was a huge waste of money. I have no idea were it is now and after getting this item, he barely touched it. Also multi pieces easily lost. It really doesnt do much."
3,"Not ""boy"" proof","The multi spy gadget concept is awesome. My 9 year old son loved it. The belt with clips was a great idea for keeping the little pieces all together. Unfortunately, all of the items were broken in no time. Not made of quality parts, so my spy guy who used it quite often was was disappointed when they didn't hold up. Picked this up on clearance at Walmart for $[...]. If I would have paid more, I would have been quite angry. I feel toys meant for boys should be better made to withstand their use."
4,Spy Belt Review,"Wild Planet Spy Gear Micro Spy Kit-X2My kids dressed up as spy kids for Halloween this year. This kit was a great addition to their costume plus a lot of fun for them in regular play! Everything worked, but it's not super durable so not designed for very young kids. For my kids though, it was perfect!"
5,Excellent!,"My acting school does movies ( and good ones ) . So this time we were making an original spy movie. I bought all of the spy gear made from Wild planet from the official website. When we tested them they were wonderful! Nothing like them! They worked very well, and we took care of them. A girl dropped her goggles and we thought they were broken, but they were not! I have no idea if that was a miracle but they are very durable from what I see! A million stars!"
4,Focuses on the psychology,"The book concentrates on the psychological techniques of better studying. In essence, the optimum psychological state for studying involves getting into a ""relaxed intensity"" state of mind. In order to enter in such a state, one must continually and patiently practice studying at the same time and location. One must also practice clearing both internal and external psychological distractions. It also provides some basic fundamental study techniques such as note taking, listening, and asking better questions. A good buy but it will not be a lifesaver for those who are trying to earn better grades."
2,Pragmatically this is a waste of time.,"After finishing the book I feel robbed of my money and my time. Although the author does provide some helpful tips, he wastes a lot of space stating the obvious, repeating himself NUMEROUS times, and filling the margins with absolutely useless random quotes whose purpose is only to consume space and make the book look larger.This book is for the novice and for those who believe everything they read. The author is only marketing the lure of good study skills, he doesn't actually teach them to you. One may think the book looks nice, big, inviting, and there are many pages. But a lot of it is repeated b.s. If you would like better books check out ""What smart students know"" and ""How to become a straight-A student"""
3,Lacks Concrete Suggestions,"This book might be helpful for the following students:students who have never tried to study and don't know where to startstudents who have convinced themselves that they are too dumb to learnstudents who never had the chance to learn study skills from parentsIf you are in this group, I encourage you to buy the book; the advice will help you develop the right frame of mind for studying. However, conscientious students have already internalized this advice, with the possible exception of the relaxation techniques. For conscientious students, though, learning to breath deeply into the belly won't be worth the price of the book or the cost of reading it.Mainly, the book lacks concrete advice on how to make your study time more effective. A much better book is Adam Robinson's What Smart Students Know."
5,great book,"I bought this book to help my students be more successful, and it has not disappointed me."
5,A must have for students of all ages and fields.,This book is an excellent guide for studying. Anyone who wants to gain knowledge by study or scholarship should have a copy. I have a master's degree and I still learned a lot about how I could improve my studies. There were many bad study habits I would have done significantly better without- and this book help me identify them clearly. The author keeps things simple- this is not a 400 page book you will never finish. In fact I read the entire thing in one sitting (and as the book would bring out- this was NOT by speed reading). Thank you Kevin Paul!
3,good price but not so good construction,"I bought this hammock and love it's size. It is ok if you lay still in it, or put a blanket in it first. The 4 kids lay in it all at once and talk and giggle but when they move about the strings spread apart and soon they slip right through it. More strings and a tighter weave is needed to make this hammock a 5."
3,Batting 500,"I bought two of these hammocks last summer. The first broke in a matter of days, but the second is still going strong. For the money, it's worth the risk."
4,Useful Guidebook Anywhere in the Tropics,"Small enough to carry easily on field trips, this informative guidebook will add a great deal of pleasure to the journey. In addition to the natural setting photographs, each alphabetized entry gives the plant or tree name in several languages, distribution, brief description, and interesting tidbits about its history or usage. The first section features flowers, the second section, flowering trees. With its companion volume, Tropical Trees, this booklet provides an excellent start to identifying and enjoying the lovely plants and flowers of the tropics. For some additional information on these plants, seeOrnamental Plants & Flowers of Tropical Mexico."
5,Oldie but goodie.,"These have to be the best ergonomic trackball ever made. No idea why MS dropped them.The closest to it is the logitech cordless optical but it pretty much sucks. Had two already and they drop off, quit in the middle of things and just annoy me to no end. Never was a fan of any wireless mouse.Trackballs are not easy to get used to, but once you do... you'll never go back. Well, unless they stop making them. Like they did. Pretty much forced to use a regular mouse and hating it. When working with graphics and have to go pixel by pixel... well, you don't have nearly the control with a mouse. So, forced to use the wacom and tho it's better than a mouse I find it a bit clunkier than a good trackball for most things."
4,It does what it says- awakens the chakras,"For those who want a workout video,or want to learn to become contortionists, this is not it. For those who want to use their bodies as a vehicle to higher awareness, this is a good way to begin. Yoga is the connecting of body, mind and spirit. To do that we must be able to listen with our bodies as well as with our ears. This video offers an excellant vehicle to do that as well as a good beginning approach to yoga. For those who want a bridge between Hatha Yoga and meditation, this video provides that.I find that the vast majority of yoga videos have very long leaders into the body of the work. It is interesting the first time, but after that one has to fast forward through it all. This is no exception."
4,You don't like crazy music,"Back when Elvis was in the army, RCA Records was deperate for new Elvis albums. So, they threw together a few songs that had never been on an LP before and called it an album. Most of the songs here are from either his Sun Records days or from theJailhouse Rocksoundtrack. This is all great music, but this album has been rendered superfluous by later releases. Why get this when you can just get thecomplete Sun sessionsor the complete Jailhouse Rocksoundtrack?"
2,DONT BUY,"I HAD THIS ALBUM WHEN I WAS A KID. SO I SAW IT ON CD AND GOT IT! BUT I GOT THE EXPORT RELEASE. IT SUCKS, THE SONGS ARE NOT THE SAME AS THE US ALBUM, BUYER BEWARE!!!!"
3,"Flawed design, poorly made","There are a few things wrong with this knife. First, the sheath is terrible. If you buy this knife buy a sheath to go with it because the knife can easily slip out of the one it comes with. The screws on the knife I received were loose and I had to tighten them so watch out for that. And the little notch about halfway down the blade is highly impractical because if you stab something it gets stuck in whatever you stabbed. It's a cheap knife, and it's cheaply made."
2,Think twice,"This knife looks really cool online...but I was very dissappointed when I got it. The compass is too close to the metal blade, so wherever you point the blade you also point north. The sheath is very cheap. The actual blade on the knife is good. Seems to hold an edge, but I really need to find a new sheath for it."
3,love my ruin...but this aint THAT great,"made to measure...awesome first singlegrotesque...pretty ok...gets annoyingunmanageable...very annoying...not that listenablesex junkie...best song on here along with made to measuremade to measure (edit)...same song, edited...kinda stinks to have it on here cuz made to measure then gets played to much and gets old even though its awesome...and besides, we could use a little profanity! am i right?mini-movie...pretty cool, its basically just an interview with all the bandmembers and some live footage 8/10"
5,Rollercoaster,"I'd be futile in my attempt to try to justify the skill, work, and musical genious that it took to develop this album. WSP's Everyday takes you on a emotional musical ride, with every song more diverse than the next. This is the first album that turned me on to The Panic and I've been along for the ride ever since....thanks Tip."
4,Panic Can STILL Do It,"After well over 10 years, WP has consistantly produced quality studio recordings. ""Everyday"" is proof that a some bands CAN still play just as well in the studio as they do live. ""Hatfield"", and ""Dream Song"" are not rushed, beautiful and enriching. Warfield, 99!"
5,Widespread Rules!!,"I recently crushed my foot(broken in several places) and have been recooperating with the help of W.P. Although I have been heavily medicated most of the time this is still some of the greatest music I have ever heard. I've been a Widespread fan for a while, but until recently I have only owned 3 of their CD's. In the last month I've purchased every CD they have. They just get better and better. I can't wait til I break something else!"
2,Mediocre....,"After the glowing endorsements of this album, I expected to be carried away on beaming epiphanies of rock-goodness and lyrical profundity; Instead, I found myself stranded on the shores of musical mediocrity and aging rockers attempting to sound cool. One of the most disposable albums I've ever (briefly) owned. Not that the album is bad or offensive at all; merely that it easily slides into the dangerous ""elevator music"" category. It reminded me just a bit of the Screaming Trees, but without the creativity or the enthusiasm. Take a pass on this one."
4,Leaves you panting for more!,"This story of a Washington wife who leaves her powerful husband to join a womyn's commune is charged with the kind of eroticism you just don't expect from the Second Lady of the United States of America. I was amazed at how graphically Ms. Cheney details the commune's daily ""massage classes"" and their predictable free-for-all aftermaths, while at the same time delivering a devastating critique of phallocentric discourse in modern culture. I can't wait for the sequel, in which the Sisters declare war against the male-dominated multinational corporation that is threatening to foreclose on their commune. Four Stars!"
5,Proves that Republicans are not frigid!!,"Lynne Cheney, in this allegorical masterpiece of 19th century Americana, smashes many pre-conceived notions about the women of her party. The Second Lady spins a story of our ancestors who propelled this country into a world superpower by working hard and playing harder - this tome should be required reading for our secondary public schools and may be a suitable replacement for controversial literature such as Huckleberry Finn, Catcher in the Rye and other titles which seem to offend constituents of her party. This book is one that most everyone should be able to enjoy."
1,YES! Oh YES!,I loved this book. Even though Lynne said today on CNN that there was no lesbian story here - well I beg to differ! This is hot and steamy frontier lovin'! Boy do Lynne and her husband know fiction! In fact that's all they know! Tellin' stories! ------- But I still had to give it only one star because it's soft-porn and I am a literary snob. But secretly I take this book out to the woodshed.
2,Nnot as expected,"Okay, maybe I'm whining but I've had my Scanpan cookware for 15 years now and the coating is peeling off both my 2 quart saucepans. Also, my 10-inch and 12-inch saute pans are about as non-stick as a seasoned cast iron set I once had. I know Scanpan say they will make good on my peeling coating problem on the saucepans, but frankly it's hard for me to give up my cookware for whatever time it would take. I am currently looking at replacing my Scanpan set and sending what I have to Goodwill. I'm considering the heieracy mixing brands and/or materials with stainless steel and nonstick cookware."
5,Super book with real live SOLUTIONS to relationship problems,"I love The Book For Couples. Not only is it fun and funny reading but it's extremely helpful. I've had mine for ten years and I still pick it up frequently.Hugh and Gayle Prather don't waste 90% of the book telling us what is WRONG with our relationship (like so many self-help books I've read). They give practical, concrete suggestions of how to be in a relationship so it will work. It's like an owner's manual for relationships.I'm disappointed that the Book For Couples is out of print now. I was looking for it here to give to a friend as a wedding gift. It's much more useful than another toaster. It is worth searching for. I hope I can find a copy somewhere (you too)."
3,weeds,"This book is well written. Details in 'Descriptions' and 'Controls' are very good. i also like the information found in what i will call...'boxed notes' often found at the end of each weed's info. packet. However for me, two issues are a drawback; copyright date of 1996 and black ink drawings. So i use this as a training tool but often have to refer to other books with color photos for customers who bring in their wilted samples."
5,Multiplication Placemat,I bought this for my 9 yr old in 4th grade to practice and she loves it. She studies while she is eating and tests herself. Fast shipping and good quality.
4,Excellent,"A 519 page book of the American musical theatre, full of personal observation and the prevailing critical consensus. This is easy reading, sometimes spending 4 or 5 pages on a single musical, with gossip about the cast or a recent television appearance. Abe Laufe had an old-fashioned-gentleman prose style that is endearing and he clearly loved his work. The book begins with the early hits of 1884 and concludes with the arrival of 'A Chorus Line'. The last pages of this edition has an extensive list of hit musicals, replete with song-titles and original cast members."
1,Non-instant and inconvenient thermometer,"As described by another reviewer, this is not an instant read thermometer because it can take more than 30 seconds to display the correct temperature even if when probe is fully submerged in boiling water. It also doesn't automatically shutoff, so the battery may be unnecessarily drained when accidentially left on. I also agree that the side display is difficult to handle because the only flat surface to hold it contains the display. The product doesn't provide any means to be clipped to a pan, therefore it can be difficult to hold it above hot food without being burned by steam while waiting for it to eventually give an accurate reading. This product is also sold under the Pyrex Accessories product line."
1,Terrible Product and a Marketing lie,"I definitely had the need for an Instant Thermometer for grilling and smoking. I had my reservations about buying a Polder because of bad reviews of their dual Probe Thermometer, but it was the only instant thermometer available at the cooking store I went to. I got a decent price of $15, but the thermometer is not instant at all. Like the other reviewers said, it takes 15-30 seconds to come to a final temperature. By that time the heat is out of the grill and your hands are getting burned from the grill. I would strongly recommend avoiding this product. It is hard to read, doesn't do what it say it does, and doesn't serve a good purpose. I don't know how Polder felt like they could market this as an instant anything."
3,It's a good serviceable tool for a good price,"I have had this thermometer for over five years, and have found it to be a good serviceable tool for what I paid for it. No, it is not instant read and yes, when I'm outside in the dark on the patio grilling at night the dial can be a little hard to see. With that said, I have never overcooked meat since I bought it, and everything I pull off the grill is perfectly cooked. This tool isn't fancy but it gets the job done at a reasonable price - the proof for me has been in the great results I've had. I've never tried it with anything other than meat though."
4,Pleasant surprise!,"I've always been a Glenn Ford fan but this was one I had somehow missed. It is a very good movie and I was surprised at how good it actually is.Glenn Ford plays quite a different role to what we are used to, the special effects are great(given the age of the movie) and a cast of talented supporting players ensure you are entertained from start to finish.Definitely worth a look!"
4,Rugged action-adventure,"Glenn Ford stars in this thrilling action western as Jacob Walsh, first to claim the Lost Dutchman mine after killing off the other propectors. Ida Lupino does very well as the ambitious bakery clerk who wants him and his gold, but finds both come at a high price in a duel between him and her husband near the mine where an earthquake kills them both. We flash forward to Walsh's grandson who's looking for the mine. Twenty men have been murdered before him and he could be next! Surprise ending helps this rather violent, wicked tale."
2,Inconsistant quality,"I bought eight of the Optima yellow top batteries for house batteries in a sailboat for the convenience of AGM, no fill, no spill, etc. These batteries are charged by a state of the art 4 stage regulator, plus solar panels on a microprocessor charge controller. The batteries are all in one bank and charged/discharged equally and never below 85%. In other words they are pampered. Now the bad, one battery failed within a week of installation. It started gassing and heating up even under a light charge. After about a year another one developed an internal short and its voltage dropped to around 8V. It was easy to detect by just touching the top. It was warmer than the rest. Six months after that, two more developed internal shorts with the same symptoms. These batteries are over rated. It appears that the build quality from battery varies widely. I will never buy another one."
5,awesome battery for people w/ alot of electronics,"its is they toughest battery i have ever owned. I bought it cause my old battery kept dying on me, ever time i would wash my jeep wrangler, and would leave the key on accessory so i could run my 2 amps,subs and speakers. now i can run everything on,my stereo,k.c.'s, lockers,winch for 2 hours before i need to start it up to charge"
1,complete junk,This battery was dead on arrival. After charging it just barely managed to turn over my 4 cylinder gas engine a couple of times before dying again. Do not throw your money away on this piece of junk.
4,A new religion,Good story of the sacrafices of the Night Preacher and his family. Persecution was very high and people were dying for their faith. Menno was the preacher and the new faith became the Mennonites. Great story presented in a language understood by young people and adults as well.
5,Chock full of information,"A very comprehensive analysis of all the foods we eat -- including how to shop, staples to keep in one's pantry, menu planning, some recipes, how to eat out more healthfully, cleansing fasts, and even how to choose the best exercise for yourself. And before you get overwhelmed, thinking there are no foods left that are healthful, she even gives suggestions of how to focus in on just your specific problem, giving lists of symptoms to help you know where your problem areas might be (foods that cause liver problems, digestion problems, pancreatic problems, allergies, low energy, etc.) Plus, the author's writing style is quite perky, which encourages you to keep up the good fight. A book every health-conscious person should own as a reference book."
3,Take A Bow,"The remixes on this single are not dance, but rather R&B grooves. The song lends itself very well to the mixes."
5,Erotic remix! You want this!,"If you buy this for any reason, do it for track 2--InDaSoul Instrumental. I got this in college and never played anything else. My friends called it the sex-version. The smooth urban sound will get your libido going and works better than Viagra!The original may sound like a nice ballad about lost love but the R&B; grooves will make you writhe in passion for that lost love for just one more night. There's also a version with vocals but it's the instrumental that leaves it all to your imagination.Light some candles and dim the lights. InDaSoul is in da house!"
3,The Night Is Over...,"This maxi single has five tracks, all of them being different versions of ""Take A Bow."" First is the InDaSoul mix, next is the InDaSoul Instrumental, third is the album version, fourth is the album instrumental, and last is the Silky Soul Mix. The InDaSoul mix is a rather bouncy, summery mid-tempo version. It doesn't fit the mood of the song, but excusing that it's a pretty nice remix. The Silky Soul mix is truer to the original in terms of feel, but is pretty average. Both mixes are straight up R&B and jettison the original's dramatic ending. Probably only worth a purchase to hard core Madonna fans and collectors. Anyone who simply likes the song is better off buying Madonna's ballads compilation, Something To Remember, or Bedtime Stories, the album this song song originated from."
3,Take A Bow,"Take A Bow was one of those ballads fans of Madonna, and fans of music learned to love. Take A Bow being on Bedtime Stories, her 1994 R&B album, it is fitting that she released R&B remixes of this song. They are good. Nothing could touch the original but these are nice to have. However the instrumentals of the original and the InDaSoul Mix weren't very nessesary. A nice thing for Madonna fans to have."
2,Not club mixes,"I bought this hoping for club mixes, and I was very disappointed. They are slow RnB type mixes. The plus side is that if you own the Japanes version of this single (I do) you get instrumental versions of all the mixes as well."
4,Frances Z,Overall I like the look and performance of the scale. The bowl is large and it easy to read all measured weights. The only complaint is the cheesy plastic-plexi-glass face and the stainless steel constuction is somewhat light weight. I would pay more for a heavier construction. The scale is made in China.
1,"Didn't work, sent it back","I'm not sure why my experience with this scale was so different from other people's, but the scale I received didn't work. I'd weight the same item two times and I'd get two different weights. The scale seems cheaply made when you pick it up, though it looks nice if you don't touch it. I returned it and bought an old vintage scale from a used kitchen appliance store down the street from my house."
4,Eclecticism that reveals a promise,"At (then) 27, Peter Gabriel has shown with this record that he needed to leave Genesis in order to express completely his own creativity (a warning that was shown in Genesis' ""The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway). As a consequence, we have this eclectic album, which shows Gabriel triying to look for a style to be comfortable with. From the Genesis-like ""Moribund The Burgermeister"", to the psychedelic beauty of ""Here Comes The Flood"", passing through the Paul-McCartney-like ""Solsbury Hill"", the 'Bolero' of ""Humdrum"" or the bluesy ""Waiting for the Big One"", this great album shows the develop of one of the most creative songwriters of our time."
1,Names Added Recently,"This review is not so much about the music, which is exceptional for all three of Peter Gabriel's first three solo albums, but about the titles added later, presumably without Gabriel's permission. ""Car"" ""Melt"" or ""Scratch"" did not appear on the original LPs. This is obviously a marketing ploy, as if the albums needed it. Call me a traditionalist, but that's the first thing I noticed about these three ""remastered"" re-releases. Those albums didn't have Roman numerals attached to them, either. They were all titled very simply ""Peter Gabriel."" And that's the way they should remain."
5,Peter Gabriel: Car,"I started listening to Peter Gabriel's music back in 1985 when my friend let me listen to ""Nursery Crimes"". Although I enjoy Genesis with Phil Collins, I've always prefered Peter Gabriel. ""Moribund The Burgurmeister"" is one of my favorites."
3,Less than genius from a genius,"I think that Gabriel's first four albums are great and if you like any one of them, you will eventually want to get all four. But, if you are coming to Peter Gabriel from So and his later albums and looking for a place to break into his earlier work, then you are better served by starting with Security and working backwards through his first four solo albums. If you are coming to Peter Gabriel through his work in Genesis, then you probably should start with this album, though I suspect if you remember Gabriel in Genesis, then you already know about these albums."
3,hard to fly,"I bought this kite because it was beautiful and well made. The only problem is I have been unable to keep it up in the air. I get the feeling that you really need a lot of wind to keep it up.If you have a good place to fly with a stiff breeze, I would recommend this kite. If you have only moderate wind, try another kite."
4,A Good Read!,"Create a product. Find someone to buy it. That's a pattern that's been pretty consistent since the beginning of civilization. But popular technology guru Jesse Berst says that the Internet has reversed this eternal sequence of commerce. The new logic: Build an audience and then find something to sell to it. That concept is at the core of The Magnet Effect, a brief, hands-on guide to Internet business and marketing. The book illuminates the strategies and tools that have come to define the Internet play, intelligently making a case as to why companies like Amazon.com are worth their multi-billion-dollar valuations even as they are hemorrhaging cash. Berst combines a broad, strategic overview and direct how-to advice in an effective manner that allows us at getAbstract.com to recommend this book to both e-commerce veterans and Internet neophytes."
1,"AFter the Crash, What Next","This book is typical of Berst..bombastic and a rehash of what everyone else was saying before. Now to read it, after the market crash, is to show exactly how dumb this guy really is. Not recommeneded."
2,For most senior leaders only,"This book may be good for new leaders at the C-level or otherwise most senior levels. However, it is not a good guide for more middle level team leaders who do not have complete flexibility to determine their own agenda."
3,Buy the first 90 days,"I bought both this book and ""the first 90 days"". The second book is definately better, unless you like baseball analogies..."
1,Nothing new.,"One of the worst and most disappointing leadership books I ever read. While I found certain sections of the book interesting, overall the book failed in teaching me anything new."
5,100-Day Action AND Communication broken down like a project plan,"Very thorough, easy to navigate, and accessible plan for leaders at all levels on how to hit the ground running and be successful in your new job. It explains how you take control of all steps, from well before Day One, all the way through defining the Burning Imperative, building team confidence and changing the culture. Very complete with lots of examples and tools. If you think you need to recalibrate your view on leadership, start here."
4,Basic career-building and team-building guide,"This basic book drills readers with a fundamental message: Good leaders follow specific plans and put their subordinates first. The authors furnish specific tactics you can use to become a disciplined leader, ready and able to produce a top team. George Bradt, Jayme A. Check and Jorge Pedraza split their material evenly among tips on being a good leader, case studies and printed planning sheets to use to set up your first 100 days on the job. The information is easy to skim; but the authors make some important points, including why you should start meeting key people in the company before you begin working in your new position. We recommend this basic career-building and team-building guide for every new manager's orientation kit. It's a small price to pay to survive and thrive in your new job."
4,Nothing to be Ashamed of,"While certainly not earth-shattering by today's standards of maze-like plot twists and forced eccentricity this novel is a reflection of its era, and an incredibly brave one at that. I found it to be an honest depiction of a floundering youth struggling to come to terms with his homosexuality in a time that offered him no real support to speak of, neither ""will nor grace"",let alone the wealth of information and services available nowadays accessible to young techno-proficient gays. I found this book a pleasant diversion,sometimes sad, and sometimes laugh out loud humorous.I admire Gore Vidal for his daring in a time when few, if any, writers dared touch this subject, when the whole culture was dripping with disapproval of homosexuality. I don't think this book will ever die. (And one more comment: the cover is strikingly handsome! Wheoever designed it should win an award.)"
3,"Like ""Valley of the Dolls from a Homosexual View","Prior to this the only Vidal book I had read was Palimpsest in which he laments over and over that ""no one reads literature anymore."" Since I tend to agree, I decided to read this, his first published novel. I did not find it to be geat literature. Unfortunately it read like a Valley of the Dolls with a Homosexual protagonist. There was no deplth to the characters, no great literary style, The characters were all cliches. I had hoped for more. Since he was young when he wrote it, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and try just one more of his works, but I'm sceptical."
5,Great songwriting from a master player,"Tom Yoder is a gifted guitar player. A very small percentage of players can ever hope to achieve his level of technical mastery. Of course, there are many great guitarists who don't write great songs, and ultimately, the song is what matters. With this CD, Tom has proven that he can write beautiful songs. Many of the songs on this CD showcase his chops, and yet are not merely excercises in technique. Michael Hedges had this talent, as does Al Petteway. Tom Yoder has it too, in a big way. Congratulations Tom! And thanks for the great music!"
5,A New Guitar Hero has Arrived!,"Tom Yoder's EAT THIS IT's SAFE is awesome! If your a lover of great guitar playing you MUST have this CD!! Satch, Eric Johnson & Kottke wrapped up in one human being!!!"
4,NONE ARE OTHERWISE,"As it says on the cover: ""This is the largest collection of limericks ever published, erotic or otherwise. None are otherwise.""The limericks that are included are often funny, some of them, however, are just plain raunchy for raunch's sake, but that's what limericks are. Limericks, like folk tales, come out of the oral tradition, and to be authentic, which these are, ought not to be sanitized, which these aren't.I found one limerick in the introduction which gives a pretty good description of the 1700 plus limericks in the body of the book.""The limerick is furtive and mean;You must keep her in close quarantine,. . . . . . Or she sneaks to the slums. . . . . . And promptly becomesDisorderly, drunk, and obscene.""That pretty well describes the content of the book. Have fun, I did."
3,Great playing/Poor sound,"Lugansky is a great pianist, and he plays beautifully in this set. The problem with the set is that the concertos were recorded in different years, and the earlier recorded pieces are not engineered properly. You can barely hear the piano in many places where it should be prominent. I wish they would reengineer these performances so that Lugansky's brilliant playing could be appreciated."
3,Christmas giving,"My wife and I, both in our 80s, used to read Mrs. Ticklefeather over and over to our two girls when they were pre-schoolers. Almost every night, when asked what book shall we read tonight, the answer was usually Mrs. Ticklefeather. We bought two copies of the book and plan on giving them to our daughers for Christmas. One girl is now 54, the other 48. We hope they remember them -- I'm sure they will.William Carnahan"
1,A shame to the name Animorph,This like its predeseres is an insult to the magical books. The books were great this wasn't. Gone is the intense action and fights the book described. Now we get garbage sneaking around. The andalites are very fake and are never showen all at once. No taxxons at all. The hork bajar just stand there. Gone is the witty smart acting of the books replaced by total garbage. Read the books and stay away from this.
2,Read The Books,"Here is my positive and negitive lists. Positive: Good Acting, Good time passer. Negitive: weak special effects, bad alien voices, toatlly different from the book, visser three looks dumb. All in all this was the best of the four, but they do weird things, like they find ax in the forest and Cassie has long hair in some episodes and short hair in others. I suggest you read the books."
2,Pencil does not last,I bought and dispatched a brand new wmp pencil three years ago and now it just stopped working where the display unit shows three dashes rather than the temperature. I feel that three years is a short time especially when I compare to my old Weller soldering iron from the late seventies which still works fine (although it does not look so good).I expected this pencil to work at least 20 years but a guess it was not meant to be. I am disappointed.
5,hindemith Ludus Tonalis,"Unlike most clssical piano music fans, my life DOES not begin or end with Chopin, and this is as good an example as any: please, piano fans, try Hindemith, try Sauer, Scharwenka, Debussy, Ravel, Messiaen, etc. You will be pleasantly surprised."
4,Great Bag....Great size... good value,"Greetings from Penfield ,NY...I bought this bag over a year ago and couldn't be happier with it.I don't use the shoulder strap...it must have been an afterthought.The stands are too heavy for shoulder carrying anyway. I carry several large cymbal stands and a hi hat stand without issue.The nylon is heavy duty and the handles are strong and comfortable. I use the 36"" version but have to collapse my rather long vintage Tama stands.Buy with confidence.....Rock On!!!!"
1,Mistaken Identity,Amazon shows 2 cases in the image. You only get one folks! I guess someone marketed it that way to get a sale from a non-attentive shopper such as myself. This review is solely on the deceptive advertising however to be fair I do think Amazon is the best on the net. Moral - pay attention to scams like this.
1,Do NOT believe the hype.,"I purchased this pot and other Scanpan cookware several (3-4) years ago. After about a year the ""miracle"" Titanium coating started to peel and flake off, just like the cheaper brands on the market we are all familiar with. NO where in the packages was any information about ""who to contact"" for warranty service. The pain of the high price paid for these inferior products will last longer than the cookware will. Don't be duped, and don't buy Scanpan. Disappointment awaits if you do."
2,Greek Mythology Dumbed Down,"If you're considering purchase of this for a younger student (say elementary school through maybe 8th grade tops) this might be a worthwhile choice. Otherwise, I would stay away from this. The content is strictly entry level. The art is done on the cheap. There are no references, and no in-depth coverage of anything. I was hoping for good coverage of major Gods & Goddesses with perhaps classical art depictions of same. None of that here. If you're looking for an electronic reference on the subject of classical mythology, this is not it. Save you money and buy a book unless you want something stricly juvenile in its orientation. I give it two stars (being generous) because it might be a decent introduction for some kid who is book-averse."
2,"Good album, bad sound","After reading other reviews, I picked this album. I am disapointed that I did not read about the poor recording. With the crowd noise as loud as the band, and the natural room echo, it sounds like it was recorded at the back of the room like a bootleg. Too bad.Lee"
1,45degree offset,received crank arm with 45 degree offset. information on item does not state this.bought from bikeworldusa. they were not helpful with my problem.
2,Control panel heats up,"Fan is nice in that it is space-saving and produces nice breeze of air. However after about a year of ownership we noticed the control panel gets VERY hot, even when the fan is powered OFF. So we keep it unplugged unless we are using it."
4,Outstanding tower fan,I use this fan in my exercise room. It fits easily in the corner of the room taking minimum space. It is quiet and powerful. It has an oscillation feature and variable temperature settings. It splits in the middle for maximum room coverage. I like the remote control option.I definitely recommend the fan.
3,Thought I'd enjoy this more...,"I'm a romance writer (Kiss and Spells), but this book wasn't as interesting as I thought. It was technically just what it said, Interviews with Romance Writers. For some reason it just didn't grab my interest and I ended up scanning it for bit and pieces I liked. I'd recommend to other romance writers to get a peek into the mind of writers. Just not my fave."
5,A Painter's views,"This is one of the best art books I have ever seen. As a still-life painter myself I keep this book nearby at all times for inspiration and just plain enjoyment. It is it written in a clear and informative style, and the lay-out seems to be trying to help you to use the book as easily as possible. The paintings reproduced are of extremely high quality and generous in quantity. All this makes me wish there was a second volume!"
2,A little dissappointing,"My daughter and I love to study about animals together but we find this cd a little boring. However, it will come in handy for looking up specific information about birds ,for school projects, or home study. It is worth $[money]."
5,"A Great CD, Though Difficult to Listen To for Long Periods","""Civilization Phase III"" is Zappa's final masterpiece, but it may be his most demanding work. Composed on the Synclavier, it is occasionally hard to listen to, because the sonic dynamics and ""colors"" are lacking, due to the absence of ""real"" instruments. Don't let this detract you from buying this CD. The composition is incredible."
1,Absolutely unlistenable,"This is (along with Lumpy Gravy) by far the worst FZ album I've ever heard. I consider myself a huge Zappa fan (I own at least 30 FZ albums), and I like a wide range of his material, from the Flo & Eddie stuff to the '88 big band stuff. But the Synclavier material is pretty much unlistenable for me. It baffles me that Zappa thought the Synclavier could replace actual musicians. He had some of the best musicians in the business and he wanted to replace them with a computer? What was he thinking? This album is nothing but Synclavier music and inane, incomprehensible spoken word tracks. If you think you need to own every Zappa album, make sure this is the last one you buy. Trust me."
4,Christmas Carousel,This is delightful but not for a 5 year old. I plan to keep it and give to my grand later or perhaps I hang it and use it myself. It is a wonderful picture of the Christmas Story but if buying it for a child they need to be at least 8. It's well constructed and fun to look at. The detail work of the popups are very good.
5,Noel book,Amazon scored a good one in getting this book. It is beautifully done and very decorative...very little text in telling the Christmas Story so additional comments would be helpful if reading to a small child..my 8 year old granddaughter loved it and the fact it unfolds into a star.
5,Absolutely beautiful book...,I loved this book so much I ordered 15 copies to send to my closest family as my Christmas Card. The book opens to reveal 5 lovely silhouette cutouts of the nativity. It opens so completely so that the front and back cover meet together and tie to form a 5 sided star shaped hanging sculpture. Very beautiful! I highly recommend this book. It would make a great table centerpiece as well as hanging decoration. My children were thrilled with our copy.
5,Amazing,This is an absolutely incredible book. My parents gave me this book and I loved it. Then one Sunday I used it for the Children's Sermon at church. My phone absolutely rang off the hook with people asking me where they could purchase this book. It is a treasure for adults and children alike!
2,don't bother,"After a long search I bought this flat 16 awg cord to replace one that was taken by a contractor doing work at my house. Basically this was the only flat one(indoor/outdoor) I could find so I bought it. Sorry I did, the 16 gauge wire is not enough to carry power to my circular saw.I miss my old flat cord!"
5,The best I've had,"I bought one of these when I found it on sale. Once I got it, I went back to buy two more because these are so freakin' cool! I use them in my car, and to take music to work. When I went back to buy more, the sale was off and they were over twice the price. That's okay though, if you look around you can find them under 30 bucks with shipping! I now have 3 of these, and not only are they the smallest, best-looking flash drives I've ever had, they are lightning fast. All 3 of them. You can't get a smaller, neater, cheaper (if you go looking) 4GB flash drive."
1,Save your money,"I bought this for my critical financial files and some other absolutely necessary data. It lasted about six months if that. I formatted it and tried to get it back in shape. Nothing worked.I'm going to go back to Kingston DataTraveler Elite 4gb. I have a Kingston that has outlived every other flash drive I've had and it's still going strong. Just not enough storage. They cost more. But you get more. Long run, you can spend lots of money on flash drives if you have to buy them every six months or a year. I'd rather spend more upfront and have something I can depend on.I sure don't recommend this drive."
3,"More ""gadgety"" than good","If you want people to be amazed, astonished, and a bit jealous of your flash drive, this is the one for you.Most can't believe that this (literally) small-finger sized drive holds 4GB.However, for how gadgety it is, it lacks in performance.First of all, it is not 4GB. It is 3.77GB. That's a lot of memory missing. 3.5GB would be a more correct listing. Secondly, it's slow. Very slow. Even pulling up a notepad file takes much longer than it should.This flash drive was one of the ones affected by Lexar's recall. Not that this particular one was, but the model in general was for overheating issues. The Firefly is still a victim of overheating, but not as badly as people who push the issue would have you think.If you want a ""wow"" drive and not a ""work"" drive, this is the one for you. That blinking blue light could win anyone over immediately. Just don't expect stellar performance."
4,Copelling read,"While reading this book you get to share in the many personal experiences of Eleanor Roosevelt. She does not focus much on her relationships, rather she focuses on sharing her experiences. The places she has gone to and the people she has talked to are absolutley amazing. She shares her firsthand experiences of the mine workers and her talks with people in communist Russia. It is amazing that just one woman has seen and heard from so many varying perspectives. She really did try to empathize with the people and situations around her and this really comes out in her book. I think many people can learn from reading this book on how to be a better listener and observer and critical thinker of the life happening around you."
5,AN INSPIRING STORY OF AN INDIVIDUAL EVOLUTION,"If this wasn't an assigned book club read, I'd have missed out learning why this remarkable woman is so.... remarkable. A ""must read"" for any woman struggling for independence....from herself"
1,"An amazing, fascinating woman writes a dull, lifeless book","Eleanor Roosevelt's autobiography provides very little information about her life. She vaguely refers to many seemingly important events (such as the death of her father, her husband's presidency) with little emotion and no detail whatsoever. If you know a lot about her and the politics of the time already, it may offer an interesting perspective. If you want to know details of ER's incredibly interesting life, read her biography by Blanch Weisen Cook."
3,Difference between autobiographies and biographies,"I was very interested to learn more about the woman - Eleanor Roosevelt. Unfortunately, she was a woman who really didn't think she was all that special. So when she wrote this book, it was less about who she was and more about the people she knew and loved. She also uses up a lot of text space listing names of people who are not really noteworthy. So much so that it quickly sounds like name dropping. I still want to read a book about Eleanor, but I will search for one that is a biography, hopefully written by someone who actually knew her. Not an entirely bad book, just not what I am looking for."
5,The Autobiography of Eleanor Roosevelt..,I am an admirer of Eleanor Roosevelt and found this book very entertaining and educational. I learned a great deal and certainly recommend it.
3,From Ugly Duckling to Powerful Woman,"This autobiography is in four parts. The first one is about her childhood, the second and third part mostly about FDR, something she admits in the beginnning of the chaper. It gives a nice insight in who they both lived together although we know now there was a lot more going on (FDR's affair) which is not in her autobiography.A nice turn of events comes after the death of FDR. Instead of retiring silently ad Hyde Park she takes on an active role in public life, being present at the founding of the UN and being a member of the committe on human rights which would lead to the Declaration of Human Rights. She also writes extensively about her travels around the world where she interviewed world leaders. Her visits to Israel and the Soviet Union are fascinating to read about."
1,Not at any price,"I've read several biographies of Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt. I should have expected, given what I know about her, that this ""autobiography"" would be nothing more than something like a compilation of her daily articles. It is superficial, highly biased, and really not worth any price."
1,Very Misleading!!!,"This item was a highly requested item by both my children to use with their 'regular' pixters. My children were very excited to get one, because 'now' they could play with their pixters in the car during night travels/trips (or any time it was difficult to see the screen, which is pretty much most of the time!). Well, long story short, you can NOT use the light with the 'regular/original' pixters! It does NOT state anywhere on the package exactly what pixters they are compatable with. It only says that it can not be used with all pixters, and that statement is not very visible! The light needs to be able to plug into the top of the pixter game unit and the 'regular/orginal' units are not made for this. My kids were extremely disappointed, as was I!"
1,"Nope, doesn't work with original Pixter","I bought it for my son to use with the Original Pixter also. And,I found what it was compatible with, after I realized that it didn't work with the original Pixter. The box I have says down in the bottom right corner (if the back of the box is facing you) of the back of the box in tiny print ""compatible with Pixter Plus and Pixter 2.0"". You would think they would put that on the front."
2,Not particularly terrible,"Pretty average, unspectacular little book that my wife made me read. Two weeks after reading it I couldn't remember much about it."
3,Not as nice as it seems,"It looks nice online but in reality, it looks kinda of cheap. Only worth 50% or less of the amazon price."
3,"Worked, but six months later, isn't so good","This battery snaps in securely, and the outer shell is durable. It definitely held more energy when new than the standard battery, but it seems to have aged more quickly than the T-Mobile battery. Thus, I sort of recommend it, but don't expect it to be the same quality level."
3,"Good battery life, but try finding a case for it...","This battery has an excellent price tag and provided an great upgrade in battery life to my t-mobile MDA. The bad part is that you won't find a decent case for your phone cause the battery is huge. Yes, you can squeeze the phone into some cases, but it ends up being cumbersome. I actually had to buy a small camera case for my phone. Which isn't so bad if you find a cool case. Also, beware of some websites selling extended battery cases, they usually don't fit."
4,A CUT ABOVE ONE OF MY FINANCE COURSES,"Even thought this book is five years old, the information still applies to the year 2000. As a person who now works iin finance, I know that detail is extremely important. This book certainly does its job by being very detail oriented. I graduated froom a very pretigious business school in which finance is actually the best subject taught, and I have to admit I think this little guide puts many pricey finance/accounting and finance professors to shame. It's also probably a good little guide for kids as well, to give them a headstart in the world of finance."
5,On time in perfect shape,The book was on time and in perfect shape. I couldn't have asked for anything more
1,Spin City for Fools to Believe!,"Amazing how there are literally thousands of news articles (at the time of Edison) and after, more then a hundred books about his genius & entire personality, that anti semite garbage was debunked by historians (Yes Henry Ford was) by a major Edison project at Rutgers University, yet this one book proves that all (yes all) are wrong! Guess you can 'fool' some of the people, some of the time, sure ya can see the other reviews."
3,"Stop the ""food fight""","Food Fight by Janet Bode is a very helpful book. It's an easy read and not hard to understand at all. It includes real storied from the people and their family and friends. It helps me understand what really goes on with eating disorders and why they can be so hard to stop. It teaches you why eating disorders star, how to prevent then, and when to know you have gone to far with your ""diet."" It's for people who know people with an eating disorder or think you or someone you might know might have an eating disorder. It's a really helpful book I think! The people in the book tell real stories about how eating disorders affected their lives from family and friends points of view. To real people my age (young teens and teens) that has this problem and have gone through it already or who are going through it now. It's an amazing book about what happens in real life."
3,poor man's friday night lights,"For anyone who has participated in youth football to any degree, this book will bring back a lot of memories (good and bad). I am a Floridian living in Texas. I cannot begin to count the number of arguments I have had with Texans concerning Texas vs. Florida football. I was really hoping this book would show up Friday Night Lights and prove that FLA reigns supreme. Sadly for me, it did not do the trick. This is a quick read and will entertain, but it lacks some of the emotional depth of F.N.L. This may be more of a regional favorite describing South Florida very well, but I'm not sure New Englanders or those in the Midwest would find much of the cultural and geographical references all that interesting. I did like it, but just not enough to recommend buying it."
4,Feel Good,"A real feel good short novel. Grisham's surprising basball knowledge, coupled with his expert story-telling ability, make this a very enjoyable read."
1,590 pages of what?,"You can't judge a book by its number of pages. I thought I was to get 590 pages of helpful information. Instead, most of the pages in this book have half a page of blank spaces. The information provided is not in-depth and not well organized. Illustrations are done poorly with poor print quality. It is easier to find information through the software's help system."
1,Poorly organized,"The tutorials in this book are poorly organized. Lesson 1 started out with a very simple part and it was half done all the way till lesson 10. It is not rocket building, it is just a rectangle with a hole through it. The author throw in two other parts in the first 10 lessons. Instrustions were either missing or difficult to understand. Not worth the money you pay for it."
3,"Just another tutorial, not worth it",This is just another tutorial. It doesn't worth the money you pay for it.
